On the other, the\nscheme should be able to adaptively and actively select the most important\nvariables to observe to maximize the detection power. To address these two\npoints, in this paper, we propose a novel detection scheme called CDSSD. In\nparticular, it describes the structure of high dimensional data with sparse\nchanges by smooth-sparse decomposition, whose parameters can be learned via\nspike-slab variational Bayesian inference. Then the posterior Bayes factor,\nwhich incorporates the learned parameters and sparse change information, is\nformulated as a detection statistic. Finally, by formulating the statistic as\nthe reward of a combinatorial multi-armed bandit problem, an adaptive sampling\nstrategy based on Thompson sampling is proposed. The efficacy and applicability\nof our method in practice are demonstrated with numerical studies and a real\ncase study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Sep 2020 16:03:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-23"}

Batching multiple\nrequests can increase throughput. However, RNN batching requires a large amount\nof padding since the batched input sequences may largely differ in length.\nSchemes that dynamically update the batch every few time-steps avoid padding.\nHowever, they require executing different RNN layers in a short timespan,\ndecreasing energy efficiency. Hence, we propose E-BATCH, a low-latency and\nenergy-efficient batching scheme tailored to RNN accelerators. It consists of a\nruntime system and effective hardware support. The runtime concatenates\nmultiple sequences to create large batches, resulting in substantial energy\nsavings. Furthermore, the accelerator notifies it when the evaluation of a\nsequence is done, so that a new sequence can be immediately added to a batch,\nthus largely reducing the amount of padding. E-BATCH dynamically controls the\nnumber of time-steps evaluated per batch to achieve the best trade-off between\nlatency and energy efficiency for the given hardware platform. We evaluate\nE-BATCH on top of E-PUR and TPU. In E-PUR, E-BATCH improves throughput by 1.8x\nand energy-efficiency by 3.6x, whereas in TPU, it improves throughput by 2.1x\nand energy-efficiency by 1.6x, over the state-of-the-art.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Sep 2020 16:22:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-23"}

The inclusion of the theoretical error has several\nadvantages over the standard practice of using the sharp momentum cut $k_{\\rm\nmax}$. First, the theoretical error covariance gradually suppresses the\ninformation from the short scales as the employed theoretical model becomes\nless reliable.

In the observational database, this phenomenon is represented\nby a small number of stars hosting systems of tightly packed co-planar planets\nas well as an ultra-short period planet, whose orbit of is misaligned relative\nto the mutual plane of the former. In this work, we explore two different\nmechanisms that can produce an ultra-short period planet that is misaligned\nwith the rest of its compact planetary system: natural decoupling between the\ninner and outer system via the stellar quadrupole moment, and decoupling forced\nby an external companion with finely-tuned orbital parameters. These two\nprocesses operate with different timescales, and can thus occur simultaneously.\nIn this work, we use the K2-266 system as an illustrative example to elucidate\nthe dynamics of these two processes, and highlight the types of constraints\nthat may arise regarding the dynamical histories of systems hosting ultra-short\nperiod planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Sep 2020 18:00:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-18"}

Since this number\nis still too large for practical CAs, we propose a new hybrid design: we first\nuse neural networks (NNs) to learn bidders' values and then apply Fourier\nanalysis to the learned representations.

In this paper,\nwe present some surprising findings that emerge from exploring the role of\nsimple orthogonality constraints as a means of imposing physics-motivated\nconstraints common in imaging.

(2) How do solar transients drive\nheliospheric variability? (3) How do solar eruptions produce energetic particle\nradiation that fills the heliosphere? (4) How does the solar dynamo work and\ndrive connections between the Sun and the heliosphere?

It is important to explore the way in which those science\nquestions are translated into an actual plan of observations that fits into the\nmission, thus ensuring that no opportunities are missed.

To confirm this hypothesis, we measure the\nphase contrast of the polymer when observed with a focused ion beam. We observe\na void at the polymer-quartz interface that results from the expansion of an\nultrafast laser-induced plasma. A modified polymer layer surrounds the void,\nbut otherwise the film seems unmodified. We also use X-ray photoelectron\nspectroscopy to confirm that there is no chemical change to the surface. When\npatterned with partially overlapping blisters, our polymer surface shows\nincreased hydrophobicity. The increased hydrophobicity of back-illuminated\nsurfaces can only result from the morphological change. This contrasts with the\ncombined chemical and morphological changes of the polymer surface caused by a\nfront-illumination geometry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Sep 2020 19:20:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-05"}

We demonstrate that this hybrid evidence\nretrieval generally performs better than either individual retrieval strategy\non three QA datasets: OpenBookQA, ReQA SQuAD, and ReQA NQ. Furthermore, we show\nthat the proposed routing strategy is considerably faster than neural methods,\nwith a runtime that is up to 5 times faster than USE-QA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Sep 2020 20:08:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-24"}

This study aims to\naddress this gap by providing a prediction model for a holistic personality\nprofiling in OSNs that included socio-relational traits (attachment\norientations) in combination with standard personality traits.

While most ensembles studied have\ncontinuous spectral distribution, Burkhardt et al introduced the ensemble of\n$k$-checkerboard matrices, a variation of Wigner matrices with entries in\ngeneralized checkerboard patterns fixed and constant. In this family, $N-k$ of\nthe eigenvalues are of size $O(\\sqrt{N})$ and were called bulk while the rest\nare tightly contrained around a multiple of $N$ and were called blip.\n  We extend their work by allowing the fixed entries to take different constant\nvalues. We can construct ensembles with blip eigenvalues at any multiples of\n$N$ we want with any multiplicity (thus we can have the blips occur at\nsequences such as the primes or the Fibonaccis). The presence of multiple blips\ncreates technical challenges to separate them and to look at only one blip at a\ntime. We overcome this by choosing a suitable weight function which allows us\nto localize at each blip, and then exploiting cancellation to deal with the\nresulting combinatorics to determine the average moments of the ensemble; we\nthen apply standard methods from probability to prove that almost surely the\nlimiting distributions of the matrices converge to the average behavior as the\nmatrix size tends to infinity. For blips with just one eigenvalue in the limit\nwe have convergence to a Dirac delta spike, while if there are $k$ eigenvalues\nin a blip we again obtain hollow $k \\times k$ GOE behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Sep 2020 21:49:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-24"}

Variability in\ndiagnosis of medical images is well established; in addition, variability in\ntraining and attention to task among medical labelers may exacerbate this\nissue. Methods for identifying and mitigating the impact of low quality labels\nhave been studied, but are not well characterized in medical imaging tasks. For\ninstance, Noisy Cross-Validation splits the training data into halves, and has\nbeen shown to identify low-quality labels in computer vision tasks; but it has\nnot been applied to medical imaging tasks specifically. In this work we\nintroduce Stratified Noisy Cross-Validation (SNCV), an extension of noisy cross\nvalidation. SNCV can provide estimates of confidence in model predictions by\nassigning a quality score to each example; stratify labels to handle class\nimbalance; and identify likely low-quality labels to analyze the causes. We\nassess performance of SNCV on diagnosis of glaucoma suspect risk from retinal\nfundus photographs, a clinically important yet nuanced labeling task. Using\ntraining data from a previously-published deep learning model, we compute a\ncontinuous quality score (QS) for each training example. We relabel 1,277\nlow-QS examples using a trained glaucoma specialist; the new labels agree with\nthe SNCV prediction over the initial label >85% of the time, indicating that\nlow-QS examples mostly reflect labeler errors. We then quantify the impact of\ntraining with only high-QS labels, showing that strong model performance may be\nobtained with many fewer examples. By applying the method to randomly\nsub-sampled training dataset, we show that our method can reduce labelling\nburden by approximately 50% while achieving model performance non-inferior to\nusing the full dataset on multiple held-out test sets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Sep 2020 23:32:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-24"}

To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose a real-time predictive pedestrian collision warning\nservice (P2CWS) for two tasks: pedestrian orientation recognition (100.53 FPS)\nand intention prediction (35.76 FPS). Our framework obtains satisfying\ngeneralization over multiple sites because of the proposed site-independent\nfeatures. At the center of the feature extraction lies 3D pose estimation. The\n3D pose analysis enables robust and accurate recognition of pedestrian\norientations and prediction of intentions over multiple sites. The proposed\nvision framework realizes 89.3% accuracy in the behavior recognition task on\nthe TUD dataset without any training process and 91.28% accuracy in intention\nprediction on our dataset achieving new state-of-the-art performance.

For deterministic automata on infinite words, no\ncanonical minimal automaton exists, and a language may have different minimal\ndeterministic B\\\"uchi (DBW) or co-B\\\"uchi (DCW) automata. In recent years,\nresearchers have studied {\\em good-for-games\\/} (GFG) automata --\nnondeterministic automata that can resolve their nondeterministic choices in a\nway that only depends on the past. Several applications of automata in formal\nmethods, most notably synthesis, that are traditionally based on deterministic\nautomata, can instead be based on GFG automata. The {\\em minimization\\/}\nproblem for DBW and DCW is NP-complete, and it stays NP-complete for GFG\nB\\\"uchi and co-B\\\"uchi automata. On the other hand, minimization of GFG\nco-B\\\"uchi automata with {\\em transition-based\\/} acceptance (GFG-tNCWs) can be\nsolved in polynomial time. In these automata, acceptance is defined by a set\n$\\alpha$ of transitions, and a run is accepting if it traverses transitions in\n$\\alpha$ only finitely often. This raises the question of canonicity of minimal\ndeterministic and GFG automata with transition-based acceptance. In this paper\nwe study this problem. We start with GFG-tNCWs and show that the safe\ncomponents (that is, these obtained by restricting the transitions to these not\nin $\\alpha$) of all minimal GFG-tNCWs are isomorphic, and that by saturating\nthe automaton with transitions in $\\alpha$ we get isomorphism among all minimal\nGFG-tNCWs. Thus, a canonical form for minimal GFG-tNCWs can be obtained in\npolynomial time. We continue to DCWs with transition-based acceptance (tDCWs),\nand their dual tDBWs. We show that here, while no canonical form for minimal\nautomata exists, restricting attention to the safe components is useful, and\nimplies that the only minimal tDCWs that have no canonical form are these for\nwhich the transition to the GFG model results in strictly smaller automaton,\nwhich do have a canonical minimal form.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 2020 01:27:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-24"}

More and more methods of the visual localization have\ntwo stages: at first to perform image retrieval by global descriptors and then\nfrom the retrieval feedback to make 2D-3D point correspondences by local\ndescriptors. The two stages are in serial for most of the methods. This simple\ncombination has not achieved superiority of fusing local and global\ndescriptors.

In this paper, we propose a joint routing and pricing\ncontrol scheme that aims to incentivize CAVs to seek centrally controlled\nsystem-optimal (SO) routing by saving on tolls while user equilibrium (UE)\nseeking human-driven vehicles (HVs) are subject to a congestion charge. The\nproblem is formulated as a bi-level optimization program where the upper level\noptimizes the dynamic toll rates using the network fundamental diagram (NFD)\nand the lower level is a mixed equilibrium simulation-based dynamic traffic\nassignment model (SBDTA) considering different combinations of SO-seeking CAVs.\nWe apply a feedback-based controller to solve for the optimal spatially\ndifferentiated distance-based congestion charge from which SO-seeking CAVs are\nexempt; but UE-seeking HVs are subject to the charge for entering the city\ncenter. To capture the distinct microscopic behavior of CAVs in the mixed\nautonomy traffic, we also implement an adaptive link fundamental diagram (FD)\nwithin the SBDTA model.

In this\npaper, we design a secure federated learning mechanism with multiple keys to\nprevent DI-level poisoning attacks for medical diagnosis, called SFPA.\nConcretely, SFPA provides privacy-preserving random forest-based federated\nlearning by using the multi-key secure computation, which guarantees the\nconfidentiality of DI-related information. Meanwhile, a secure defense strategy\nover encrypted locally-submitted models is proposed to defense DI-level\npoisoning attacks. Finally, our formal security analysis and empirical tests on\na public cloud platform demonstrate the security and efficiency of SFPA as well\nas its capability of resisting DI-level poisoning attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 2020 03:15:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-24"}

Previously, we have shown that the H-SEARCH;\nwhich is the problem of finding a Hadamard matrix (H-matrix) among all possible\nbinary matrices of corresponding order, is a hard problem that can be solved by\na quantum computer. However, due to the limitation on the number of qubits and\nconnections in present day quantum processors, only low orders H-SEARCH are\nimplementable. In this paper, we show that by adopting classical\nconstruction/search techniques of the H-matrix, we can develop new quantum\ncomputing methods to find higher order H-matrices. Especially, the Turyn-based\nquantum computing method can be further developed to find an arbitrarily high\norder H-matrix by balancing the classical and quantum resources. This method is\npotentially capable to find some unknown H-matrices of practical and scientific\ninterests, where a classical computer alone cannot do because of the\nexponential grow of the complexity.

In\nnear-Chandrasekhar-mass (near-M_Ch) models of SNe Ia, the central density\nreaches >10^9 g cm^{-3}. The electron chemical potential becomes higher than\nthe Q-values of electron capture (EC) transitions between fp-shell nuclei, so a\nportion of the available electrons is captured by iron group elements and thus\nneutron-rich isotopes are formed. Since EC reaction rates are sensitive to the\ndensity, the degree of neutronization is a key to distinguish near- and\nsub-M_Ch models. In order to compare observations and theoretical models, an\naccurate treatment of EC reactions is necessary. In previous theoretical works,\nhowever, effects of electron screening on ECs are ignored. Screening lowers EC\nrates and thus leads to a higher electron fraction. We implement electron\nscreening on ECs to calculate explosive SN Ia nucleosynthesis in a near-M_Ch\nsingle degenerate model.

NIDSs are\ntrained with the samples of benign and intrusive network traffic. Training\nsamples belong to either majority or minority classes depending upon the number\nof available instances. Majority classes consist of abundant samples for the\nnormal traffic as well as for recurrent intrusions. Whereas, minority classes\ninclude fewer samples for unknown events or infrequent intrusions. NIDSs\ntrained on such imbalanced data tend to give biased predictions against\nminority attack classes, causing undetected or misclassified intrusions. Past\nresearch works handled this class imbalance problem using data-level approaches\nthat either increase minority class samples or decrease majority class samples\nin the training data set. Although these data-level balancing approaches\nindirectly improve the performance of NIDSs, they do not address the underlying\nissue in NIDSs i.e. they are unable to identify attacks having limited training\ndata only.

I-SiamIDS\nidentifies both majority and minority classes at the algorithm-level without\nusing any data-level balancing techniques.

In the real world, network data is usually formed in a streaming\nfashion. The distributions of patterns that refer to neighborhood information\nof nodes may shift over time. The GNN model needs to learn the new patterns\nthat cannot yet be captured. But learning incrementally leads to the\ncatastrophic forgetting problem that historical knowledge is overwritten by\nnewly learned knowledge. Therefore, it is important to train GNN model to learn\nnew patterns and maintain existing patterns simultaneously, which few works\nfocus on. In this paper, we propose a streaming GNN model based on continual\nlearning so that the model is trained incrementally and up-to-date node\nrepresentations can be obtained at each time step. Firstly, we design an\napproximation algorithm to detect new coming patterns efficiently based on\ninformation propagation. Secondly, we combine two perspectives of data\nreplaying and model regularization for existing pattern consolidation.\nSpecially, a hierarchy-importance sampling strategy for nodes is designed and a\nweighted regularization term for GNN parameters is derived, achieving greater\nstability and generalization of knowledge consolidation. Our model is evaluated\non real and synthetic data sets and compared with multiple baselines. The\nresults of node classification prove that our model can efficiently update\nmodel parameters and achieve comparable performance to model retraining. In\naddition, we also conduct a case study on the synthetic data, and carry out\nsome specific analysis for each part of our model, illustrating its ability to\nlearn new knowledge and maintain existing knowledge from different\nperspectives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 2020 06:52:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 2020 06:56:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-07"}

These models generally\nconsist of a balance equation for the cell density, one for the density of the\nextracellular matrix (ECM), and a force-balance equation describing the\nmechanical equilibrium of the cell-ECM system. Assuming this system can be\nregarded as an isotropic linear viscoelastic material, the force-balance\nequation is often defined using the Kelvin-Voigt model of linear\nviscoelasticity to represent the stress-strain relation of the ECM. However,\ndue to the multifaceted bio-physical nature of the ECM constituents, there are\nrheological aspects that cannot be effectively captured by this model and,\ntherefore, depending on the type of biological tissue considered, other\nconstitutive models of linear viscoelasticity may be better suited. In this\nwork, we systematically assess the pattern formation potential of different\nstress-strain constitutive equations for the ECM within a mechanical model of\npattern formation in biological tissues. The results obtained through linear\nstability analysis support the idea that constitutive equations capturing\nviscous flow and permanent set (Maxwell model, Jeffrey model) have a pattern\nformation potential much higher than the others (Kelvin-Voigt model, standard\nlinear solid model), further confirmed by the results of our numerical\nsimulations. Our findings suggest that further empirical work is required to\nacquire detailed quantitative information on the mechanical properties of\ncomponents of the ECM in different biological tissues in order to furnish\nmechanochemical models of pattern formation with stress-strain constitutive\nequations for the ECM that provide a more faithful representation of the\nunderlying tissue rheology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 2020 06:53:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2020 08:23:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 24 Mar 2021 17:24:22 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 25 Mar 2021 08:13:55 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 2 Apr 2021 12:29:17 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 11 May 2021 11:18:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-12"}

Second, different matching orders for a\npattern have significant performance differences and are quite hard to predict.\nWhen these factors are mixed, this problem becomes extremely complicated. High\nefficient pattern matching remains an open problem currently. To address these\nchallenges, we propose GraphPi, a high performance distributed pattern matching\nsystem.

The proposed\nCOOL is an error-free and deterministic BA protocol that does not rely on\ncryptographic technique. It is secure against computationally unbounded\nadversary. With the achievable performance by the proposed COOL and the known\nlower bounds, we characterize the optimal communication complexity exponent as\n\\[\\beta^*(\\alpha,\\delta)=\\max\\{1+\\alpha,1+\\delta\\}\\] for $\\beta=\n\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\log b/\\log n$, $\\alpha=\\lim_{n \\to \\infty} \\log \\ell/\\log n$\nand $\\delta=\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\log t/\\log n$.

We study this question with a simple tree formation game which is\nrelated to the well-known fair single-source connection game by Anshelevich et\nal. (FOCS'04) and selfish spanning tree games by Gourv\\`es and Monnot\n(WINE'08). In our game agents correspond to nodes in a network that activate a\nsingle outgoing edge to connect to the common target node (possibly via other\nnodes). Agents pay for their path to the common target, and edge costs are\nshared fairly among all agents using an edge. The main novelty of our model is\ndynamic edge costs that depend on the in-degree of the respective endpoint.\nThis reflects that connecting to popular nodes that have increased internal\ncoordination costs is more expensive since they can charge higher prices for\ntheir routing service.\n  In contrast to related models, we show that equilibria are not guaranteed to\nexist, but we prove the existence for infinitely many numbers of agents.\nMoreover, we analyze the structure of equilibrium trees and employ these\ninsights to prove a constant upper bound on the Price of Anarchy as well as\nnon-trivial lower bounds on both the Price of Anarchy and the Price of\nStability. We also show that in comparison with the social optimum tree the\noverall cost of an equilibrium tree is more fairly shared among the agents.\nThus, we prove that self-organization of rational agents yields on average only\nslightly higher cost per agent compared to the centralized optimum, and at the\nsame time, it induces a more fair cost distribution. Moreover, equilibrium\ntrees achieve a beneficial trade-off between a low height and low maximum\ndegree, and hence these trees might be of independent interest from a\ncombinatorics point-of-view.

In nonlinear optics, the wave mixing effect far away from the resonance\ncondition is often used to realize QFC because it can prevent the vacuum field\nreservoir from destroying the quantum state of the converted photon\neffectively. Under conditions far away from resonance, experiments typically\nrequire strong pump light to generate large nonlinear interactions to achieve\nhigh-efficiency QFC. However, strong pump light often generates additional\nnoise photons through spontaneous Raman or parametric conversion processes.\nHerein, we theoretically study another efficient QFC scheme based on a resonant\nfour-wave mixing system. Due to the effect of electromagnetically induced\ntransparency (EIT), this resonant QFC scheme can greatly suppress vacuum field\nnoise at low light levels; consequently, the converted photon can inherit the\nquantum state of the input photon with high fidelity. Our research demonstrates\nthat if the conversion efficiency of the EIT-based QFC is close to 100%, the\nwave function and quadrature variance of the converted photon are almost the\nsame as the input probe photon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 2020 09:42:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2020 10:27:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-24"}

Very recently, Hirshberg et al.\n[J. Chem. Phys. 152, 171102 (2020)] have proposed to alleviate the FSP based on\nthe Bogoliubov inequality. In the present work, we extend this approach by\nadding a parameter that controls the perturbation, allowing for an\nextrapolation to the exact result. In this way, we can also use thermodynamic\nintegration to obtain an improved estimate of the fermionic energy. As a test\nsystem, we choose electrons in 2D and 3D quantum dots and find in some cases a\nspeed-up exceeding 10^6 , as compared to standard PIMC, while retaining a\nrelative accuracy of $\\sim0.1\\%$. Our approach is quite general and can readily\nbe adapted to other simulation methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 2020 10:14:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}

Existing few-shot font generation methods aim to learn to\ndisentangle the style and content element from a few reference glyphs, and\nmainly focus on a universal style representation for each font style. However,\nsuch approach limits the model in representing diverse local styles, and thus\nmakes it unsuitable to the most complicated letter system, e.g., Chinese, whose\ncharacters consist of a varying number of components (often called \"radical\")\nwith a highly complex structure. In this paper, we propose a novel font\ngeneration method by learning localized styles, namely component-wise style\nrepresentations, instead of universal styles. The proposed style\nrepresentations enable us to synthesize complex local details in text designs.\nHowever, learning component-wise styles solely from reference glyphs is\ninfeasible in the few-shot font generation scenario, when a target script has a\nlarge number of components, e.g., over 200 for Chinese. To reduce the number of\nreference glyphs, we simplify component-wise styles by a product of component\nfactor and style factor, inspired by low-rank matrix factorization. Thanks to\nthe combination of strong representation and a compact factorization strategy,\nour method shows remarkably better few-shot font generation results (with only\n8 reference glyph images) than other state-of-the-arts, without utilizing\nstrong locality supervision, e.g., location of each component, skeleton, or\nstrokes.

Thus, when $S/N=3$ and total exposure time is 1 second\nfor 10 m telescopes, the magnitude limited by the atmosphere is $13.01^{\\rm m}$\nat Ali and $12.96^{\\rm m}$ at Daocheng. Even under less-than-ideal\ncircumstances, i.e., the readout noise of a deep cryogenic detector is less\nthan $200e^-$ and the instruments are cooled to below $-87.2^\\circ \\rm C$, the\nabove magnitudes decrease by $0.056^{\\rm m}$ at most. Therefore, according to\nobservational requirements with a large telescope in a given infrared band,\nastronomers can use this sensitivity model as a tool for guiding site surveys,\ndetector selection and instrumental thermal-control.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 2020 10:46:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Sep 2020 10:06:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-02"}

First, they primarily rely on a similarity network diffusion and\nfusion technique, which only considers node degree as a topological measure in\nthe cross-network diffusion process, thereby overlooking rich topological\nmeasures of the brain network (e.g., centrality). Second, both diffusion and\nfusion techniques are implemented in fully unsupervised manner, which might\ndecrease the discriminative power of the estimated BNAs. To fill these gaps, we\npropose a supervised multi-topology network cross-diffusion (SM-netFusion)\nframework for estimating a BNA satisfying : (i) well-representativeness\n(captures shared traits across subjects), (ii) well-centeredness (optimally\nclose to all subjects), and (iii) high discriminativeness (can easily and\nefficiently identify discriminative brain connections that distinguish between\ntwo populations).

However, such frameworks are primarily designed\nto operate on images, limiting their generalizability to non-Euclidean\ngeometric data such as brain graphs. While a growing number of connectomic\nstudies has demonstrated the promise of including brain graphs for diagnosing\nneurological disorders, no geometric deep learning work was designed for\nmultiple target brain graphs prediction from a source brain graph. Despite the\nmomentum the field of graph generation has gained in the last two years,\nexisting works have two critical drawbacks. First, the bulk of such works aims\nto learn one model for each target domain to generate from a source domain.\nThus, they have a limited scalability in jointly predicting multiple target\ndomains. Second, they merely consider the global topological scale of a graph\n(i.e., graph connectivity structure) and overlook the local topology at the\nnode scale of a graph (e.g., how central a node is in the graph). To meet these\nchallenges, we introduce MultiGraphGAN architecture, which not only predicts\nmultiple brain graphs from a single brain graph but also preserves the\ntopological structure of each target graph to predict. Its three core\ncontributions lie in: (i) designing a graph adversarial auto-encoder for\njointly predicting brain graphs from a single one, (ii) handling the mode\ncollapse problem of GAN by clustering the encoded source graphs and proposing a\ncluster-specific decoder, (iii) introducing a topological loss to force the\nreconstruction of topologically sound target brain graphs.

We verified that the use of the softness diagrams\nincluding the emission-line ratio HeI/HeII combined with black-body\nphotoionization models can provide an absolute scale of T* for these objects.\nThe application of a Bayesian-like code indicates T* in the range 50-80 kK for\nthe sample of galaxies, with a mean value higher than 60 kK. The average of\nthese high temperature values can only be reproduced using cluster model\npopulations with nearly metal-free stars, although such ionizing sources cannot\nexplain either the highest T* values, beyond 1 sigma, or the dispersion\nobserved in the softness diagrams. According to our photoionization models,\nmost sample galaxies could be affected to some extent by ionizing photon\nleaking, presenting a mean photon absorption fraction of 26% or higher\ndepending on the metallicity assumed for the ionizing cluster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 2020 11:48:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-11"}

To fill this gap, we introduce\nGSR-Net (Graph Super-Resolution Network), the first super-resolution framework\noperating on graph-structured data that generates high-resolution brain graphs\nfrom low-resolution graphs. First, we adopt a U-Net like architecture based on\ngraph convolution, pooling and unpooling operations specific to non-Euclidean\ndata. However, unlike conventional U-Nets where graph nodes represent samples\nand node features are mapped to a low-dimensional space (encoding and decoding\nnode attributes or sample features), our GSR-Net operates directly on a single\nconnectome: a fully connected graph where conventionally, a node denotes a\nbrain region, nodes have no features, and edge weights denote brain\nconnectivity strength between two regions of interest (ROIs). In the absence of\noriginal node features, we initially assign identity feature vectors to each\nbrain ROI (node) and then leverage the learned local receptive fields to learn\nnode feature representations. Second, inspired by spectral theory, we break the\nsymmetry of the U-Net architecture by topping it up with a graph\nsuper-resolution (GSR) layer and two graph convolutional network layers to\npredict a HR graph while preserving the characteristics of the LR input. Our\nproposed GSR-Net framework outperformed its variants for predicting\nhigh-resolution brain functional connectomes from low-resolution connectomes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 2020 12:02:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-24"}

In this paper, we conduct sanity\nchecks for the above beliefs on several recent unstructured pruning methods and\nsurprisingly find that: (1) A set of methods which aims to find good\nsubnetworks of the randomly-initialized network (which we call \"initial\ntickets\"), hardly exploits any information from the training data; (2) For the\npruned networks obtained by these methods, randomly changing the preserved\nweights in each layer, while keeping the total number of preserved weights\nunchanged per layer, does not affect the final performance.

Such sample connectomic\nrepresentation might include irrelevant and redundant features that could\nmislead the training sample selection step. Undoubtedly, this fails to exploit\nand preserve the topology of the brain connectome. To overcome this major\ndrawback, we propose Residual Embedding Similarity-Based Network selection\n(RESNets) for predicting brain network evolution trajectory from a single\ntimepoint. RESNets first learns a compact geometric embedding of each training\nand testing sample using adversarial connectome embedding network. This nicely\nreduces the high-dimensionality of brain networks while preserving their\ntopological properties via graph convolutional networks. Next, to compute the\nsimilarity between subjects, we introduce the concept of a connectional brain\ntemplate (CBT), a fixed network reference, where we further represent each\ntraining and testing network as a deviation from the reference CBT in the\nembedding space. As such, we select the most similar training subjects to the\ntesting subject at baseline by comparing their learned residual embeddings with\nrespect to the pre-defined CBT. Once the best training samples are selected at\nbaseline, we simply average their corresponding brain networks at follow-up\ntimepoints to predict the evolution trajectory of the testing network.

Methods: We propose an\nanisotropic 3D multi-stream CNN architecture, which processes additional scan\ndirections to produce a higher-resolution isotropic prostate segmentation. We\ninvestigate two variants of our architecture, which work on two (dual-plane)\nand three (triple-plane) image orientations, respectively. We compare them with\nthe standard baseline (single-plane) used in literature, i.e., plain axial\nsegmentation.

In all regimes, thermal averages of\narbitrary observables are evaluated by integrals, as if the thermal Wigner\nfunction were a classical distribution.\n  The extension of the semiclassical approximation for quantum propagators to\nan imaginary thermal time, bridges the complex intervening region between the\nhigh and the low temperature limit. This leads to a simple quantum correction\nto the classical high temperature regime, irrespective of whether the motion is\nregular or chaotic. A variant of the full semiclassical approximation with a\nreal thermal time, though in a doubled phase space, avoids any search for\nparticular trajectories in the evaluation of thermal averages. The double\nHamiltonian substitutes the stable minimum of the original system's Hamiltonian\nby a saddle, which eliminates local periodic orbits from the stationary phase\nevaluation of the integrals for the partition function and thermal averages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 2020 13:04:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-30"}

The cosmic HI and H_2 densities are roughly equal at\nz~1.5. The H_2 density then decreases by a factor 6^{+3}_{-2} to today's value,\nwhereas the HI density stays approximately constant. The stellar mass density\nis increasing continuously with time and surpasses that of the total gas\ndensity (HI and H_2) at redshift z~1.5. The growth in stellar mass cannot be\naccounted for by the decrease in cosmic H_2 density, necessitating significant\naccretion of additional gas onto galaxies. With the new H_2 constraints, we\npostulate and put observational constraints on a two step gas accretion\nprocess: (i) a net infall of ionized gas from the intergalactic/circumgalactic\nmedium to refuel the extended HI reservoirs, and (ii) a net inflow of HI and\nsubsequent conversion to H_2 in the galaxy centers. Both the infall and inflow\nrate densities have decreased by almost an order of magnitude since z~2.\nAssuming that the current trends continue, the cosmic molecular gas density\nwill further decrease by about a factor of two over the next 5 Gyr, the stellar\nmass will increase by approximately 10%, and cosmic star formation activity\nwill decline steadily toward zero, as the gas infall and accretion shut down.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 2020 13:08:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-28"}

Here we design an adversarial brain network normalizer for\nrepresenting each brain network as a transformation of a fixed centered\npopulation-driven connectional template. Such graph normalization with respect\nto a fixed reference paves the way for reliably identifying the most similar\ntraining samples (i.e., brain graphs) to the testing sample at baseline\ntimepoint. The testing evolution trajectory will be then spanned by the\nselected training graphs and their corresponding evolution trajectories.

By fluorescence stereomicroscopy and layer-by-layer\ndissection after the rabbits were sacrificed, the perivascular and adventitial\nconnective tissues (PACT) along the saphenous veins and inferior vena cava were\nfound to be stained by sodium fluorescein from ankle dermis, which coincided\nwith the findings by MRI.

Galaxies\nhosting young radio AGN, whose jets are in the first phases of expansion\nthrough the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM), are the ideal targets to\nprobe the energetic significance of this mechanism. In this paper, we\ncharacterise the warm ionised gas outflows in a sample of nine young radio\nsources from the 2Jy sample, combining X-shooter spectroscopy and Hubble Space\nTelescope (HST) imaging data. We find that the warm outflows have similar\nradial extents (~0.06-2 kpc) as radio sources, consistent with the idea that\n`jet mode' AGN feedback is the dominant driver of the outflows detected in\nyoung radio galaxies. Exploiting the broad spectral coverage of the X-shooter\ndata, we have used the ratios of trans-auroral emission lines of [SII] and\n[OII] to estimate the electron densities, finding that most of the outflows\nhave gas densities ($\\log( n_e~cm^{-3})~3-4.8 $), which we speculate could be\nthe result of compression by jet-induced shocks. Combining our estimates of the\nemission-line luminosities, radii, and densities, we find that the kinetic\npowers of the warm outflows are a relatively small fraction of the energies\navailable from the accretion of material onto the central supermassive black\nhole (SMBH), reflecting AGN feedback efficiencies below 1% in most cases.\nOverall, the warm outflows detected in our sample are strikingly similar to\nthose found in nearby ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs), but more\nenergetic and with a high feedback efficiencies on average than the general\npopulation of nearby AGN of similar bolometric luminosity; this is likely to\nreflect a high degree of coupling between the jets and the near-nuclear ISM in\nthe early stages of radio source evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 2020 14:36:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-04"}

A\nfundamental question remained open on the relationship between the two common\nmodels for graphs -- with and without access to the \"random edge\" query --\nnamely whether it is possible to sample an edge uniformly at random in the\nmodel without access to the random edge queries.\n  In this paper, we answer this question positively. Specifically, we give an\nalgorithm solving this problem that runs in expected time $O(\\frac{n}{\\sqrt{m}}\n\\log n)$. This is only a logarithmic factor slower than the lower bound given\nin [5]. Our algorithm uses the algorithm from [7] which we analyze in a more\ncareful way, leading to better bounds in general graphs. We also show a way to\nsample edges $\\epsilon$-close to uniform in expected time $O(\\frac{n}{\\sqrt{m}}\n\\log \\frac{1}{\\epsilon})$, improving upon the best previously known algorithm.\n  We also note that sampling edges from a distribution sufficiently close to\nuniform is sufficient to be able to simulate sublinear algorithms that use the\nrandom edge queries while decreasing the success probability of the algorithm\nonly by $o(1)$. This allows for a much simpler algorithm that can be used to\nemulate random edge queries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 2020 14:42:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-24"}

In the present paper, the effect of friction decoupling\nhas been studied from the theoretical and numerical point of view. First, it\nhas been found that friction vector decoupling causes the reduction of the\ncomputed friction force and the rotation of the friction force vector. Second,\nit has been demonstrated that decoupled-friction models lack of rotational\ninvariance, i.e. model results depend on the alignment of the reference\nframework.

It assumes two sets of states wherein any state in the\nfirst set can be coupled to any state in the second set but the states within\neach set are not coupled between themselves. Another important condition is the\ndegeneracy of the states in each set, although all couplings between the states\nfrom different sets can be detuned from resonance by the same detuning. The\ndegeneracy condition limits the application of the MS transformation in various\nphysically interesting situations, e.g. in the presence of electric and/or\nmagnetic fields or light shifts, which lift the degeneracy in each set of\nstates, e.g. when these sets comprise the magnetic sublevels of levels with\nnonzero angular momentum. This paper extends the MS transformation to such\nsituations, in which the states in each of the two sets are nondegenerate. To\nthis end, we develop an alternative way for the derivation of Morris-Shore\ntransformation, which can be applied to non-degenerate sets of states. We\npresent a generalized eigenvalue approach, by which, in the limit of small\ndetunings from degeneracy, we are able to generate an effective Hamiltonian\nthat is dynamically equivalent to the non-degenerate Hamiltonian. The effective\nHamiltonian can be mapped to the Morris-Shore basis with a two-step similarity\ntransformation. After the derivation of the general framework, we demonstrate\nthe application of this technique to the popular Lambda three-state system, and\nthe four-state tripod, double-Lambda and diamond systems. In all of these\nsystems, our formalism allows us to reduce their quantum dynamics to simpler\ntwo-state systems even in the presence of various detunings, e.g. generated by\nexternal fields of frequency drifts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 2020 14:49:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Jan 2021 15:51:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-08"}

For the vapor-liquid phase\nseparation we observe that $\\ell$, the average domain length, grows with time\n($t$) as $t^{1/2}$, a behavior that has connection with hydrodynamics. At low\nenough temperature, a sharp crossover of this time dependence to a much slower,\ntemperature dependent, growth is identified within the time scale of our\nsimulations, implying \"solid\"-like final state of the high density phase. This\ncrossover is, interestingly, accompanied by strong differences in domain\nmorphology and other structural aspects between the two situations. For aging,\nwe have presented results for the order-parameter autocorrelation function.\nThis quantity exhibits data-collapse with respect to $\\ell/\\ell_w$, $\\ell$ and\n$\\ell_w$ being the average domain lengths at times $t$ and $t_w$ ($\\leq t$),\nrespectively, the latter being the age of a system. Corresponding scaling\nfunction follows a power-law decay: $~\\sim (\\ell/\\ell_w)^{-\\lambda}$, for $t\\gg\nt_w$. The decay exponent $\\lambda$, for the vapor-liquid case, is accurately\nestimated via the application of an advanced finite-size scaling method. The\nobtained value is observed to satisfy a bound.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 2020 15:11:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-04"}

Toward investigating this problem, it is important to understand\nthe kinds of chroma distortions that arise, how they relate to luma compression\ndistortions, and how they can affect perceived quality. We designed and carried\nout a subjective experiment to measure subjective video quality on both luma\nand chroma distortions, introduced both in isolation as well as together.\nSpecifically, the new subjective dataset comprises a total of $210$ videos\nafflicted by distortions caused by varying levels of luma quantization\ncommingled with different amounts of chroma quantization. The subjective scores\nwere evaluated by $34$ subjects in a controlled environmental setting. Using\nthe newly collected subjective data, we were able to demonstrate important\nshortcomings of existing video quality models, especially in regards to chroma\ndistortions. Further, we designed an objective video quality model which builds\non existing video quality algorithms, by considering the fidelity of chroma\nchannels in a principled way. We also found that this quality analysis implies\nthat there is room for reducing bitrate consumption in modern video codecs by\ncreatively increasing the compression factor on chroma channels.

Incident handling can be divided into five steps:\ndetection, analysis, containment, eradication, and recovery. For networked\ncontrol systems, the containment step can be conducted through physical\ndisconnection of an attacked subsystem. In accordance with the disconnection,\nthe equipped attack detection unit should be reconfigured to maintain its\ndetection capability.

One way to improve\nresource utilization and thus reduce the total cost of ownership is to offer\nunused resources (referred to as ephemeral resources) at a lower price.\nHowever, reselling resources needs to meet the expectations of its customers in\nterms of Quality of Service. The goal is so to maximize the amount of reclaimed\nresources while avoiding SLA penalties. To achieve that, cloud providers have\nto estimate their future utilization to provide availability guarantees. The\nprediction should consider a safety margin for resources to react to\nunpredictable workloads. The challenge is to find the safety margin that\nprovides the best trade-off between the amount of resources to reclaim and the\nrisk of SLA violations. Most state-of-the-art solutions consider a fixed safety\nmargin for all types of metrics (e.g., CPU, RAM). However, a unique fixed\nmargin does not consider various workloads variations over time which may lead\nto SLA violations or/and poor utilization. In order to tackle these challenges,\nwe propose ReLeaSER, a Reinforcement Learning strategy for optimizing the\nephemeral resources' utilization in the cloud. ReLeaSER dynamically tunes the\nsafety margin at the host-level for each resource metric. The strategy learns\nfrom past prediction errors (that caused SLA violations).

The majority of\nexisting representation learning approaches often require a large number of\nconsistent and noise-free labels. However, due to various reasons such as\nbudget constraints and privacy concerns, labels are very limited in many\nreal-world scenarios. Directly applying standard representation learning\napproaches on small labeled data sets will easily run into over-fitting\nproblems and lead to sub-optimal solutions.

A great deal of effort has been put into using sentence\nembeddings to improve several important natural language processing tasks.\nRelation extraction is such an NLP task that aims at identifying structured\nrelations defined in a knowledge base from unstructured text. A promising and\nmore efficient approach would be to embed both the text and structured\nknowledge in low-dimensional spaces and discover semantic alignments or\nmappings between them. Although a number of techniques have been proposed in\nthe literature for embedding both sentences and knowledge graphs, little is\nknown about the structural and semantic properties of these embedding spaces in\nterms of relation extraction. In this paper, we investigate the aforementioned\nproperties by evaluating the extent to which sentences carrying similar senses\nare embedded in close proximity sub-spaces, and if we can exploit that\nstructure to align sentences to a knowledge graph.

In this paper we test a CMOS camera (Oxford Instruments Neo 5.5) for\nits general performance as a detector of x-rays and low energy $\\gamma$-rays\nand assess its sensitivity relative to the World Health Organization upper\nlimit on lead in drinking water. Energies from 6 keV to 60 keV are examined.\nThe CMOS camera has a linear energy response over this range and its energy\nresolution is for the most part slightly better than 2 %.

The conformation equilibrium between open (up) and closed (down)\nconformations of receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike is studied from the\nfirst-principle. The conformational state population is deduced from the free\nenergy change in conformation transition of S protein. We demonstrated that the\nfree energy includes two parts, one from the multi-minima of conformational\npotential and another from the variation of structural elasticity. Both factors\nare dependent of amino acid mutation. The former is related to the change of\naffinity of RBD to ACE 2 due to the mutation in the subdomain RBM (receptor\nbinding motif) of RBD. The latter is caused by the change of elastic energy of\nS protein. When the affinity has increased significantly and/or the elastic\nenergy has been reduced substantially the equilibrium is biased to the open\nconformation. Only then can the virus infection process continue. Possible new\nSARS-CoV-2 variants from amino acid mutations in 5-9 sites on RBD interface are\npredicted.

Only a few works concern totally symmetric\ntensors of higher-order. Work on other tensors of higher-order than two is\nexceptionally rare. We believe that one major reason for this gap is the lack\nof knowledge about suitable tensor decompositions for the general higher-order\ntensors. We focus here on three dimensions as most applications are concerned\nwith three-dimensional space. A lot of work on symmetric second-order tensors\nuses the spectral decomposition. The work on totally symmetric higher-order\ntensors deals frequently with a decomposition based on spherical harmonics.\nThese decompositions do not directly apply to general tensors of higher-order\nin three dimensions. However, another option available is the deviatoric\ndecomposition for such tensors, splitting them into deviators. Together with\nthe multipole representation of deviators, it allows to describe any tensor in\nthree dimensions uniquely by a set of directions and non-negative scalars. The\nspecific appeal of this methodology is its general applicability, opening up a\npotentially general route to tensor interpretation. The underlying concepts,\nhowever, are not broadly understood in the engineering community. In this\narticle, we therefore gather information about this decomposition from a range\nof literature sources. The goal is to collect and prepare the material for\nfurther analysis and give other researchers the chance to work in this\ndirection.

We then make\nuse of measurable operators to define the states of the network in a manner\nconsistent with a Markov process. This yields a Dirac-Von Neumann formulation\nconsistent with quantum mechanics. Moreover, the formulation presented here has\nthe advantage of having a computational efficiency devoid of the number of\nlayers in the network. This, paired with the natural efficiency of quantum\ncomputing, can imply a significant improvement in efficiency, particularly for\ndeep networks. Finally, but not least, the developments here are quite general\nin nature since the approach presented here can also be used for\nquantum-inspired neural networks implemented on conventional computers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 2020 01:38:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-22"}

These works use mainly anglophone sources of\nnarrative, thus not capturing the entire complexity of the multitude of\nemotions contained in global news articles. This study expands the existing\nbody of research by incorporating a wide array of emotions from newspapers\naround the world - extracted from the Global Database of Events, Language and\nTone (GDELT) - into macroeconomic forecasts. We present a thematic data\nfiltering methodology based on a bi-directional long short term memory neural\nnetwork (Bi-LSTM) for extracting emotion scores from GDELT and demonstrate its\neffectiveness by comparing results for filtered and unfiltered data. We model\nindustrial production and consumer prices across a diverse range of economies\nusing an autoregressive framework, and find that including emotions from global\nnewspapers significantly improves forecasts compared to three autoregressive\nbenchmark models. We complement our forecasts with an interpretability analysis\non distinct groups of emotions and find that emotions associated with happiness\nand anger have the strongest predictive power for the variables we predict.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 2020 10:10:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 10:04:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-15"}

Database-driven numerical\nsolvers for large model domains can only accurately predict large-scale flow\nbehaviour when they incorporate upscaled descriptions of that structure. The\nupscaling is particularly challenging for rocks with multimodal porosity\nstructures such as carbonates, where several different types of structures are\ninteracting. It is the connectivity both within and between these different\nstructures that controls the porosity-permeability relationship at the larger\nlength scales. Recent advances in machine learning combined with numerical\nmodelling and structural analysis have allowed us to probe the relationship\nbetween structure and permeability more deeply. We have used this integrated\napproach to tackle the challenge of upscaling multimodal and multiscale porous\nmedia. We present a novel method for upscaling multimodal porosity-permeability\nrelationships using machine learning based multivariate structural regression.\nA m-CT image of limestone was divided into sub-volumes and permeability was\ncomputed using the DBS model. The porosity-permeability relationship from Menke\net al. was used to assign permeability values to the microporosity. Structural\nattributes of each sub-volume were extracted and then regressed against the\nsolved permeability using an Extra-Trees regression model to derive an upscaled\nporosity-permeability relationship. Ten upscaled test cases were then modelled\nat the Darcy scale using the regression and benchmarked against full DBS\nsimulations, a numerically upscaled Darcy model, and a K-C fit. We found good\nagreement between the full DBS simulations and both the numerical and machine\nlearning upscaled models while the K-C model was a poor predictor in all cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 2020 11:14:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-02"}

In this paper, the\ndemand forecasting problem in BSSs is studied. Spatial and temporal features\nare critical for demand forecasting in BSSs, but it is challenging to extract\nspatiotemporal dynamics. Another challenge is to capture the relations between\nspatiotemporal dynamics and external factors, such as weather, day-of-week, and\ntime-of-day. To address these challenges, we propose a multiple spatiotemporal\nfusion network named MSTF-Net. MSTF-Net consists of multiple spatiotemporal\nblocks: 3D convolutional network (3D-CNN) blocks, eidetic 3D convolutional long\nshort-term memory networks (E3D-LSTM) blocks, and fully-connected (FC) blocks.\nSpecifically, 3D-CNN blocks highlight extracting short-term spatiotemporal\ndependence in each fragment (i.e., closeness, period, and trend); E3D-LSTM\nblocks further extract long-term spatiotemporal dependence over all fragments;\nFC blocks extract nonlinear correlations of external factors. Finally, the\nlatent representations of E3D-LSTM and FC blocks are fused to obtain the final\nprediction. For two real-world datasets, it is shown that MSTF-Net outperforms\nseven state-of-the-art models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 2020 06:51:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Nov 2021 12:34:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-09"}
