Hence, many\nmethodologies for explaining machine learning models have been proposed to\naddress this problem. In this work, we introduce strategies to improve local\nexplanations taking into account the distribution of the data used to train the\nblack-box models. We show that our approach, MeLIME, produces more meaningful\nexplanations compared to other techniques over different ML models, operating\non various types of data. MeLIME generalizes the LIME method, allowing more\nflexible perturbation sampling and the use of different local interpretable\nmodels. Additionally, we introduce modifications to standard training\nalgorithms of local interpretable models fostering more robust explanations,\neven allowing the production of counterfactual examples. To show the strengths\nof the proposed approach, we include experiments on tabular data, images, and\ntext; all showing improved explanations. In particular, MeLIME generated more\nmeaningful explanations on the MNIST dataset than methods such as\nGuidedBackprop, SmoothGrad, and Layer-wise Relevance Propagation.

In comparison, fairness in settings with preferences on both\nsides, that is, where agents have to be matched to other agents, has received\nmuch less attention. Moreover, two-sided matching literature has largely\nfocused on ordinal preferences. This paper initiates the study of fairness in\nstable many-to-one matchings under cardinal valuations. Motivated by real-world\nsettings, we study leximin optimality over stable many-to-one matchings. We\nfirst investigate matching problems with ranked valuations where all agents on\neach side have the same preference orders or rankings over the agents on the\nother side (but not necessarily the same valuations). Here, we provide a\ncomplete characterisation of the space of stable matchings. This leads to FaSt,\na novel and efficient algorithm to compute a leximin optimal stable matching\nunder ranked isometric valuations (where, for each pair of agents, the\nvaluation of one agent for the other is the same). Building upon FaSt, we\npresent an efficient algorithm, FaSt-Gen, that finds the leximin optimal stable\nmatching for a more general ranked setting. When there are exactly two agents\non one side who may be matched to many agents on the other, strict preferences\nare enough to guarantee an efficient algorithm. We next establish that, in the\nabsence of rankings and under strict preferences (with no restriction on the\nnumber of agents on either side), finding a leximin optimal stable matching is\nNP-Hard. Further, with weak rankings, the problem is strongly NP-Hard, even\nunder isometric valuations. In fact, when additivity and non-negativity are the\nonly assumptions, we show that, unless P=NP, no efficient polynomial factor\napproximation is possible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Sep 2020 16:28:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 13 Feb 2021 18:41:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 15 Jul 2021 12:13:15 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 25 May 2022 05:58:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-26"}

In fact,\nthe axiomatisation is complete in the sense that the entire structural\ninformation considered on the closed *-algebra -- namely addition, scalar\nmultiplication, adjunction and composition of operators as well as the operator\nnorm -- is reflected in the C*-algebra. From this point of view, we treat\nVon-Neumann algebras, another class of operator algebras also defined as closed\n*-algebras, but with respect to another topology -- one possibility is the weak\noperator topology. The problem asking for an axiomatisation of Von-Neumann\nalgebras was solved by S. Sakai who introduced so-called W*-algebras. They are\nC*-algebras which, considered as a Banach space, are isometrically isomorphic\nto the dual space of another Banach space called the predual. Sakai's theorem\nasserts that the W*-algebras provide an axiomatisation of Von-Neumann algebras.\nIn this master's thesis, we give a proof of Sakai's theorem. In fact, we\nprovide a stronger version of Sakai's theorem which shows that W*-algebras\nindeed form a complete axiomatisation analogous to the situation for\nC*-algebras. Additionally, we show uniqueness of the predual up to isometric\nisomorphism, simplifying Sakai's original proof by using our strengthened\nversion of Sakai's theorem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Sep 2020 16:48:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-15"}

In order\nto leverage the inherent structures of the predicate categories, we propose to\nfirst build the language hierarchy and then utilize the Hierarchy Guided\nFeature Learning (HGFL) strategy to learn better region features of both the\ncoarse-grained level and the fine-grained level. Besides, we also propose the\nHierarchy Guided Module (HGM) to utilize the coarse-grained level to guide the\nlearning of fine-grained level features. Experiments show that the proposed\nsimple yet effective method can improve several state-of-the-art baselines by a\nlarge margin (up to $33\\%$ relative gain) in terms of Recall@50 on the task of\nScene Graph Generation in different datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Sep 2020 17:36:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-15"}

In this study, we take a step towards simple, interpretable metrics\nfor trust quantification by introducing a suite of metrics for assessing the\noverall trustworthiness of deep neural networks based on their behaviour when\nanswering a set of questions. We conduct a thought experiment and explore two\nkey questions about trust in relation to confidence: 1) How much trust do we\nhave in actors who give wrong answers with great confidence? and 2) How much\ntrust do we have in actors who give right answers hesitantly? Based on insights\ngained, we introduce the concept of question-answer trust to quantify\ntrustworthiness of an individual answer based on confident behaviour under\ncorrect and incorrect answer scenarios, and the concept of trust density to\ncharacterize the distribution of overall trust for an individual answer\nscenario. We further introduce the concept of trust spectrum for representing\noverall trust with respect to the spectrum of possible answer scenarios across\ncorrectly and incorrectly answered questions. Finally, we introduce\nNetTrustScore, a scalar metric summarizing overall trustworthiness. The suite\nof metrics aligns with past social psychology studies that study the\nrelationship between trust and confidence. Leveraging these metrics, we\nquantify the trustworthiness of several well-known deep neural network\narchitectures for image recognition to get a deeper understanding of where\ntrust breaks down. The proposed metrics are by no means perfect, but the hope\nis to push the conversation towards better metrics to help guide practitioners\nand regulators in producing, deploying, and certifying deep learning solutions\nthat can be trusted to operate in real-world, mission-critical scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Sep 2020 17:37:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 20 Sep 2020 02:45:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 3 Apr 2021 15:08:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-06"}

We study this problem by\nconducting small-scale waterbath experiments with fresh water and salt water\nsolutions. As a model of human passage, a vertical cylinder is pulled through a\nplanar jet representing an air curtain and separating two zones at different\ndensities. For a fixed travel distance of the cylinder before and after the air\ncurtain, the average infiltration flux of dense fluid in light fluid side\nincreases with increasing cylinder velocity.

It is shown that the field localization of SPPs\ncoupled with TM polarized terahertz light can be enhanced if the nonlinearity\nis increased. On the side, a numerical solution based on Split Step Beam\nPropagation Method (SSBPM) suggests that spatial Modulation Instabilty (MI) can\nbe dominant. Accordingly, larger nonlinearity leads to the generation of\ndiscrete plasmon solitons rather than the diffracted profile resulted for the\nmodest nonlinearity. Adding then the temporal variations to the nonlinear\namplitude equation and solving numerically by predictor-corrector method, it is\nrevealed that temporal MI appears as ultrashort pulse trains with\nmulti-periodic behavior. Evoking the similarity with a laser cavity, the\nwaveguide can be assumed as a spasing system-assuming the large nonlinearity\nregime-in which if the coupling depth is raised, the character of MI will be\nchanged from the convective to absolute and the amplitude of SPPs will grow\nfast.

While\nstandard methods exist, they work best at coarse-grained national or state\nscales with abundant data, and struggle to accommodate the partial\nobservability and sparse data common at finer scales (e.g., individual schools\nor towns). For example, case counts may be sparse when only a small fraction of\ninfections are caught by a testing program. Or, whether an infected individual\ntests positive may depend on the kind of test and the point in time when they\nare tested. We propose a Bayesian framework which accommodates partial\nobservability in a principled manner.

The objective\nis to maximize the weighted sum rate via jointly optimizing the hybrid\nanalog/digital beamforming at the base station and reflection matrix at the\nIRS. {Since the analog beamforming and reflection matrix need to cater all\nusers and subcarriers, it is difficult to directly solve the formulated\nproblem, and thus, an alternatively iterative optimization algorithm is\nproposed.} Specifically, the analog beamforming is designed by solving a MIMO\ncapacity maximization problem, while the digital beamforming and reflection\nmatrix optimization are both tackled using semidefinite relaxation technique.\nConsidering that obtaining perfect channel state information (CSI) is a\nchallenging task in IRS-based systems, we further explore the case with the\nimperfect CSI for the channels from the IRS to users. Under this setup, we\npropose a robust beamforming and reflection matrix design scheme for the\noriginally formulated non-convex optimization problem. Finally, simulation\nresults are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nalgorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Sep 2020 01:35:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-15"}

Method: We surveyed 76\nactive SE researchers participants of a flagship SE conference in Brazil, using\na questionnaire with 11 questions to share their views on the use of GL in the\ncontext of SE research. We followed a qualitative approach to analyze open\nquestions. Results: We found that most surveyed researchers use GL mainly to\nunderstand new topics.

We compare films grown by radio frequency\nsputtering and pulsed laser deposition (PLD). The growth factors that influence\nthe crystal quality for each method are different. For PLD grown films a thin\namorphous Sb2Te3 seed layer most significantly influences the crystal quality.\nIn contrast, the crystalline quality of films grown by sputtering is rather\nsensitive to the deposition temperature and less affected by the presence of a\nseed layer. This difference is somewhat surprising as both methods are\nout-of-thermal-equilibrium plasma-based methods. Non-adiabatic quantum\nmolecular dynamics simulations show that this difference originates from the\ndensity of excited atoms in the plasma. The PLD plasma is more intense and with\nhigher energy than that used in sputtering, and this increases the electronic\ntemperature of the deposited atoms, which concomitantly increases the adatom\ndiffusion lengths in PLD. In contrast, the adatom diffusivity is dominated by\nthe thermal temperature for sputter grown films.

To\nreduce the domain discrepancy, existing methods mainly attempt to generate\npseudo labels for unlabeled target images by clustering algorithms. However,\nclustering methods tend to bring noisy labels and the rich fine-grained details\nin unlabeled images are not sufficiently exploited. In this paper, we seek to\nimprove the quality of labels by capturing feature representation from multiple\naugmented views of unlabeled images. To this end, we propose a Self-Supervised\nKnowledge Distillation (SSKD) technique containing two modules, the identity\nlearning and the soft label learning. Identity learning explores the\nrelationship between unlabeled samples and predicts their one-hot labels by\nclustering to give exact information for confidently distinguished images. Soft\nlabel learning regards labels as a distribution and induces an image to be\nassociated with several related classes for training peer network in a\nself-supervised manner, where the slowly evolving network is a core to obtain\nsoft labels as a gentle constraint for reliable images. Finally, the two\nmodules can resist label noise for re-ID by enhancing each other and\nsystematically integrating label information from unlabeled images.

However, photo-generated excitons in OSC films mostly occupy highly\nlocalized states over their lifetime. Energy transport is hence thought to be\nmainly mediated by the site-to-site hopping of localized excitons, limiting\nexciton diffusion coefficients to below ~10^{-2} cm^2/s with corresponding\ndiffusion lengths below ~50 nm. Here, using ultrafast optical microscopy\ncombined with non-adiabatic molecular dynamics simulations, we present evidence\nfor a new highly-efficient energy transport regime: transient exciton\ndelocalization, where energy exchange with vibrational modes allows excitons to\ntemporarily re-access spatially extended states under equilibrium conditions.\nIn films of highly-ordered poly(3-hexylthiophene) nanofibers, prepared using\nliving crystallization-driven self-assembly, we show that this enables exciton\ndiffusion constants up to 1.1+-0.1 cm^2/s and diffusion lengths of 300+-50 nm.\nOur results reveal the dynamic interplay between localized and delocalized\nexciton configurations at equilibrium conditions, calling for a re-evaluation\nof the basic picture of exciton dynamics.

More\nprecisely, we are interested in trees with the following classes of matrix edge\nweights: 1. positive definite matrix weights, 2. lower (or upper) triangular\nmatrix weights with positive diagonal entries. For trees with the above classes\nof matrix edge weights, we define Perron values and Perron branches. Further,\nwe have shown the existence of vertices satisfying properties analogous to the\nproperties of characteristic vertices of trees with positive edge weights in\nterms of Perron values and Perron branches, and we call such vertices\ncharacteristic-like vertices. In this case, the eigenvalues of the Laplacian\nmatrix are nonnegative, and we obtain a lower bound for the first non-zero\neigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix in terms of Perron value.

We find the presence of the\nsecond parameter, torsion, to be imperative for correct conductivity modelling\nsince usage of the curvature alone leads to unavoidable dependence on segment\nsize during CNT discretization. In literature, the influence of intrinsic MWCNT\nresistivity is often discarded as negligible due to ballistic transport of\nelectrons. To verify this assumption, we check the sensitivity of results to\nfinite resistivity of CNTs. Percolation threshold and the critical index are\ncalculated for different sets of model parameters. The model finite-size effect\non the percolation threshold is investigated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Sep 2020 15:08:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-15"}
