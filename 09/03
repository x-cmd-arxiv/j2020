This is especially true\nfor systems such as turbulence where the perturbations do not behave like\nGaussian white noise, introducing non-Markovian behavior to the dynamics. We\naddress these challenges with a framework for identifying interpretable\nstochastic nonlinear dynamics from experimental data, using both forward and\nadjoint Fokker-Planck equations to enforce statistical consistency. If the form\nof the Langevin equation is unknown, a simple sparsifying procedure can provide\nan appropriate functional form. We demonstrate that this method can effectively\nlearn stochastic models in two artificial examples: recovering a nonlinear\nLangevin equation forced by colored noise and approximating the second-order\ndynamics of a particle in a double-well potential with the corresponding\nfirst-order bifurcation normal form. Finally, we apply the proposed method to\nexperimental measurements of a turbulent bluff body wake and show that the\nstatistical behavior of the center of pressure can be described by the dynamics\nof the corresponding laminar flow driven by nonlinear state-dependent noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2020 16:10:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Mar 2021 16:11:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-07"}

We also investigated how a\npost-explosion large-scale anisotropy in the SN affects the ejecta distribution\nand the matter mixing of heavy elements in the remnant, during the first 5000\nyears of evolution. In the case of a spherically symmetric SN explosion without\nlarge-scale anisotropies, the remnant roughly keeps memory of the original\nonion-like layering of ejecta soon after the SN event. Nevertheless, as the\nreverse shock hits the ejecta, the element distribution departs from a\nhomologous expansion, because of the slowing down of the outermost ejecta\nlayers due to interaction with the reverse shock. In the case of a large-scale\nanisotropy developed after the SN, we found that the chemical stratification in\nthe ejecta can be strongly modified and the original onion-like layering is not\npreserved. The anisotropy may cause spatial inversion of ejecta layers, for\ninstance leading to Fe/Si-rich ejecta outside the O shell, and may determine\nthe formation of Fe/Si-rich jet-like features that may protrude the remnant\noutline.

Starting\nfrom the incompressible hydrodynamic theory of Chen et al\n\\cite{chen2015critical}, we show that increasing the activity leads to a\nrenormalization group (RG) crossover between the equilibrium ferromagnetic\nfixed point, with dynamical critical exponent $z = 2$, and the off-equilibrium\nactive fixed point, with $z = 1.7$ (in $d=3$). We run simulations of the\nclassic Vicsek model in the near-ordering regime and find that critical slowing\ndown indeed changes with activity, displaying two exponents that are in\nremarkable agreement with the RG prediction. The equilibrium-to-off-equilibrium\ncrossover is ruled by a characteristic length scale beyond which active\ndynamics takes over. Such length scale is smaller the larger the activity,\nsuggesting the existence of a general trade-off between activity and system's\nsize in determining the dynamical universality class of active matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2020 16:22:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-10"}

Among others, physical systems described by waves, such as photonic\nand quantum devices, have been utilized to compute the solution of mathematical\nproblems (1-18). However, previous devices have not fully exploited the\nlinearity of the wave equation, which as we show here, allows for the\nsimultaneous parallel solution of several independent mathematical problems\nwithin the same device. In this Letter, we demonstrate, theoretically and\nexperimentally, that a transmissive cavity filled with a judiciously tailored\ndielectric distribution and embedded in a multi-frequency feedback loop can\ncalculate the solutions of an arbitrary number of mathematical problems\nsimultaneously. We design, build, and test a computing structure at microwave\nfrequencies that solves two independent integral equations with any two\narbitrary inputs. We offer another design that can invert four arbitrary 5x5\nmatrices, confirming its functionality with numerical simulations. We believe\nour results presented here can provide \"coincident computing\" and pave the way\nfor the design of low-power, ultrafast, parallel photonic analog computing\ndevices for sensing and signal processing in embedded computing applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2020 17:01:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-14"}

Most studies have analyzed so far constraints on\npairs of MG parameters, but here, we explore constraints on one parameter at a\ntime while fixing the other at its GR value. This allows us to analyze various\nmodels while benefiting from a stronger constraining power from the data. We\nalso explore which specific datasets are in tension with GR. We find that\nmodels with ($\\mu=1$, $\\eta$) and ($\\mu$, $\\eta=1$) exhibit a 3.9-$\\sigma$ and\n3.8-$\\sigma$ departure from GR when using Planck18+SNe+BAO, while ($\\mu$,\n$\\eta$) shows a tension of 3.4-$\\sigma$. We find no tension with GR for models\nwith the MG parameter $\\Sigma$ fixed to its GR value. Using a Bayesian model\nselection analysis, we find that some one-parameter MG models are moderately\nfavored over $\\Lambda$CDM when using all dataset combinations except Planck CMB\nLensing and DES data. Namely, Planck18 shows a moderate tension with GR that\nonly increases when adding any combination of RSD, SNe, or BAO. However, adding\nlensing diminishes or removes these tensions, which can be attributed to the\nability of lensing in constraining the MG parameter $\\Sigma$. The two overall\ngroups of datasets are found to have a dichotomy when performing consistency\ntests with GR, which may be due to systematic effects, lack of constraining\npower, or modelling. These findings warrant further investigation using more\nprecise data from ongoing and future surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2020 17:06:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Mar 2022 23:25:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-10"}

In this paper we present a detailed test and calibration of the\nmatter bispectrum counterterms in the Effective Field Theory of LSS against a\nsuite of $N$-body simulations. We are going beyond previous studies in\nemploying realisation based perturbation theory that allows for a significant\nreduction in cosmic variance error bars. This enables the measurement of the\nlow-energy constants on large scales before two-loop corrections become\nrelevant, around $k<0.09 h\\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ at $z=0$. We also go beyond\nprevious work in using bispectrum propagator terms, i.e. correlators with\nlinear and second order fields, to quantify the two new counterterms in\nisolation and to establish consistency with the power spectrum counterterm. By\ninvestigating the fully non-linear bispectrum, $B_{\\mathrm{nnn}}$, as well as\nthe terms $B_{\\mathrm{n}11}$ and $B_{\\mathrm{n}21}$, we find evidence for the\nnew counterterms deviating from the shape suggested by the UV-limit of the\nrelevant bispectrum contributions.

Rough stochastic volatility models, such as\nthe rough Bergomi model [Bayer, Friz, Gatheral, Quantitative Finance 16(6),\n887-904, 2016], seek to fit observed market data based on the observation that\nthe log-realized variance behaves like a fractional Brownian motion with small\nHurst parameter, $H < 1/2$, over reasonable timescales. Both time series of\nasset prices and option-derived price data indicate that $H$ often takes values\nclose to $0.1$ or less, i.e., rougher than Brownian motion. This change\nimproves the fit to both option prices and time series of underlying asset\nprices while maintaining parsimoniousness. However, the non-Markovian nature of\nthe driving fractional Brownian motion in rough volatility models poses severe\nchallenges for theoretical and numerical analyses and for computational\npractice. While the explicit Euler method is known to converge to the solution\nof the rough Bergomi and similar models, its strong rate of convergence is only\n$H$. We prove rate $H + 1/2$ for the weak convergence of the Euler method for\nthe rough Stein-Stein model, which treats the volatility as a linear function\nof the driving fractional Brownian motion, and, surprisingly, we prove rate one\nfor the case of quadratic payoff functions. Our proof uses Talay-Tubaro\nexpansions and an affine Markovian representation of the underlying and is\nfurther supported by numerical experiments. These convergence results provide a\nfirst step toward deriving weak rates for the rough Bergomi model, which treats\nthe volatility as a nonlinear function of the driving fractional Brownian\nmotion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2020 17:51:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 May 2021 10:49:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 15 Dec 2021 15:55:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-16"}

This can be used to\ndifferentiate daily activities from signing, while features from RF data show\nthat imitation signing by non-signers is 99\\% differentiable from native ASL\nsigning. Feature-level fusion of RF sensor network data is used to achieve\n72.5\\% accuracy in classification of 20 native ASL signs. Implications: RF\nsensing can be used to study dynamic linguistic properties of ASL and design\nDeaf-centric smart environments for non-invasive, remote recognition of ASL. ML\nalgorithms should be benchmarked on native, not imitation, ASL data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2020 17:56:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-03"}

It can simultaneously store many memories by using spinful bosons\ncoupled to a degenerate multimode optical cavity. The associative memory is\nrealized by a confocal cavity QED neural network, with the cavity modes serving\nas the synapses, connecting a network of superradiant atomic spin ensembles,\nwhich serve as the neurons. Memories are encoded in the connectivity matrix\nbetween the spins, and can be accessed through the input and output of patterns\nof light. Each aspect of the scheme is based on recently demonstrated\ntechnology using a confocal cavity and Bose-condensed atoms. Our scheme has two\nconceptually novel elements. First, it introduces a new form of random spin\nsystem that interpolates between a ferromagnetic and a spin-glass regime as a\nphysical parameter is tuned---the positions of ensembles within the cavity.\nSecond, and more importantly, the spins relax via deterministic\nsteepest-descent dynamics, rather than Glauber dynamics. We show that this\nnonequilibrium quantum-optical scheme has significant advantages for\nassociative memory over Glauber dynamics: These dynamics can enhance the\nnetwork's ability to store and recall memories beyond that of the standard\nHopfield model. Surprisingly, the cavity QED dynamics can retrieve memories\neven when the system is in the spin glass phase. Thus, the experimental\nplatform provides a novel physical instantiation of associative memories and\nspin glasses as well as provides an unusual form of relaxational dynamics that\nis conducive to memory recall even in regimes where it was thought to be\nimpossible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2020 17:59:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-16"}

By means of such equivalences,\nany stabilizer code can be reduced to a graph code. We can therefore represent\ncode CFTs by graphs. We study code CFTs with small central charge $c=n\\leq 12$,\nand find many interesting examples. Among them is a non-chiral $E_8$ theory,\nwhich is based on the root lattice of $E_8$ understood as an even self-dual\nLorentzian lattice. By analyzing all graphs with $n\\leq 8$ nodes we find many\npairs and triples of physically distinct isospectral theories. We also\nconstruct numerous modular invariant functions satisfying all the basic\nproperties expected of the CFT partition function, yet which are not partition\nfunctions of any known CFTs. We consider the ensemble average over all code\ntheories, calculate the corresponding partition function, and discuss its\npossible holographic interpretation. The paper is written in a self-contained\nmanner, and includes an extensive pedagogical introduction and many explicit\nexamples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2020 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-24"}

The Standard-Model Extension (SME) parameterizes LV in a\nmodel-independent way, respecting $SU(2)_L$ gauge invariance. This means, e.g.,\nthat the neutrino and charged-lepton sectors are linked to each other. Hence,\non the one hand, any modification of neutrino properties simultaneously gives\nrise to effects for charged leptons, which is why the tight limits on\nflavour-off-diagonal LV for neutrinos imply new bounds on modifications of\ncharged leptons. On the other hand, LV for left-handed charged leptons implies\nLV for neutrinos. Since LV modifications of the charged-lepton sector are, in\ngeneral, even more constraining than effects in the flavour-diagonal neutrino\nsector, we obtain novel tight bounds on LV in the latter.

Using a visibility-plane lens modelling technique, we create pixellated\nreconstructions of the dust morphology, and CO line morphology and kinematics.\nWe find that the quasar hosts in our sample can be distinguished into two\ntypes: 1) galaxies characterised by clumpy, extended dust distributions\n($R_{\\rm eff}\\sim2$ kpc) and mean star formation rate surface densities\ncomparable to sub-mm-selected dusty star-forming galaxies ($\\Sigma_{\\rm\nSFR}\\sim3$ M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$); 2) galaxies that have sizes in\ndust emission similar to coeval passive galaxies and compact starbursts\n($R_{\\rm eff}\\sim0.5$ kpc), with high mean star formation rate surface\ndensities ($\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR}=$ 400$-$4500 M$_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$)\nthat may be Eddington-limited or super-Eddington. The small size of some quasar\nhosts suggests that we observe them at a stage in their transformation into\ncompact spheroids, where a high density of dynamically unstable gas leads to\nefficient star formation and black hole accretion. For the one system where we\nprobe the mass of the gas reservoir, we find a gas fraction of just $0.06 \\pm\n0.04$ and a depletion timescale of $50 \\pm 40$ Myr, suggesting it is\ntransitioning into quiescence. In general, we expect that the extreme level of\nstar formation in the compact quasar host galaxies will rapidly exhaust their\ngas reservoirs and could quench with or without help from active galactic\nnuclei feedback.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2020 18:21:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2020 11:07:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-11"}

Such flares are usually strongest and\nappear earlier at shorter radio wavelengths. Hence, VLBI at mm-wavelengths is\nbest suited to study the earliest structural changes of compact jets associated\nwith emission flares. We study the morphological changes of the parsec-scale\njet in the nearby (z=0.049) gamma-ray bright radio galaxy 3C111 following a\nflare that developed into a major radio outburst in 2007. We analyse three\nsuccessive observations of 3C111 at 86 GHz with the Global mm-VLBI Array (GMVA)\nbetween 2007 and 2008 which yield a very high angular resolution of ~45muas. In\naddition, we make use of single-dish radio flux density measurements from the\nF-GAMMA and POLAMI programmes, archival single-dish and VLBI data. We resolve\nthe flare into multiple plasma components with a distinct morphology resembling\na bend in an otherwise remarkably straight jet. The flare-associated features\nmove with apparent velocities of ~4.0c to ~4.5c and can be traced also at lower\nfrequencies in later epochs. Near the base of the jet, we find two bright\nfeatures with high brightness temperatures up to ~10^11K, which we associate\nwith the core and a stationary feature in the jet. The flare led to multiple\nnew jet components indicative of a dynamic modulation during the ejection. We\ninterpret the bend-like feature as a direct result of the outburst which makes\nit possible to trace the transverse structure of the jet. In this scenario, the\ncomponents follow different paths in the jet stream consistent with\nexpectations for a spine-sheath structure, which is not seen during\nintermediate levels of activity. The possibility of coordinated multiwavelength\nobservations during a future bright radio flare in 3C111 makes this source an\nexcellent target for probing the radio-gamma-ray connection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2020 18:45:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-04"}

It in some sense describes the global structure of a graph.\nRoughly, a graph has treewidth $k$ if it can be decomposed by a sequence of\nnoncrossing cutsets of size at most $k$ into pieces of size at most $k+1$. The\nstudy of hereditary graph classes (i.e. those closed under vertex deletion\nonly) reveals a different picture, where cutsets that are not necessarily\nbounded in size (such as star cutsets, 2-joins and their generalization) are\nrequired to decompose the graph into simpler pieces that are structured but not\nnecessarily bounded in size. A number of such decomposition theorems are known\nfor complex hereditary graph classes, including even-hole-free graphs, perfect\ngraphs and others. These theorems do not describe the global structure in the\nsense that a tree decomposition does, since the cutsets guaranteed by them are\nfar from being noncrossing. They are also of limited use in algorithmic\napplications.\n  We show that in the case of even-hole-free graphs of bounded degree the\ncutsets described in the previous paragraph can be partitioned into a bounded\nnumber of well-behaved collections. This allows us to prove that even-hole-free\ngraphs with bounded degree have bounded treewidth, resolving a conjecture of\nAboulker, Adler, Kim, Sintiari and Trotignon [arXiv:2008.05504]. As a\nconsequence, it follows that many algorithmic problems can be solved in\npolynomial time for this class, and that even-hole-freeness is testable in the\nbounded degree graph model of property testing. In fact we prove our results\nfor a larger class of graphs, namely the class of $C_4$-free odd-signable\ngraphs with bounded degree.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2020 18:50:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 5 Dec 2020 19:20:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 30 Aug 2021 14:55:36 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 1 Feb 2022 15:58:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-02"}

One of the main research\nchallenges in VANET is the design and implementation of network routing\nprotocols which manage to trigger V2X communication with the reliable\nend-to-end connectivity and efficient packet transmission. The organically\nchanging nature of road transport vehicles poses a significant threat to VANET\nwith respect to the accuracy and reliability of packet delivery. Therefore, a\nposition-based routing protocol tends to be the predominant method in VANET as\nthey overcome rapid changes in vehicle movements effectively. However, existing\nrouting protocols have some limitations such as (i) inaccurate in high dynamic\nnetwork topology, (ii) defective link-state estimation (iii) poor movement\nprediction in heterogeneous road layouts. In this paper, a target-driven and\nmobility prediction (TDMP) based routing protocol is therefore developed for\nhigh-speed mobility and dynamic topology of vehicles, fluctuant traffic flow\nand diverse road layouts in VANET. The primary idea in TDMP is that the\ndestination target of a driver is included in the mobility prediction to assist\nthe implementation of the routing protocol. Compared to existing geographic\nrouting protocols which mainly greedily forward the packet to the next-hop\nbased on its current position and partial road layout, TDMP is developed to\nenhance the packet transmission with the consideration of the estimation of\ninter-vehicles link status, and the prediction of vehicle positions dynamically\nin fluctuant mobility and global road layout.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2020 19:01:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 6 Sep 2020 14:13:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2020 14:53:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-02"}

All of the electromagnetic resonators share a\ncommon property: they possess a discrete set of special frequencies that show\nup as peaks in scattering spectra and are called resonant modes. These resonant\nmodes are soon recognized to dictate the interaction between electromagnetic\nresonators and light. This leads to a hypothesis that the optical response of\nresonators is the synthesis of the excitation of each physical-resonance-state\nin the system: Under the excitation of external pulses, these resonant modes\nare initially loaded, then release their energy which contributes to the total\noptical responses of the resonators. These resonant modes with complex\nfrequencies are known in the literature as the Quasi-Normal Mode (QNM).\nMathematically, these QNMs correspond to solutions of the eigenvalue problem of\nsource-free Maxwell's equations. In the case where the optical structure of\nresonators is unbounded and the media are dispersive (and possibly anisotropic\nand non-reciprocal) this requires solving non-linear (in frequency) and\nnon-Hermitian eigenvalue problems. Thus, the whole problem boils down to the\nstudy of the spectral theory for electromagnetic Maxwell operators. As a\nresult, modal expansion formalisms have recently received a lot of attention in\nphotonics because of their capabilities to model the physical properties in the\nnatural resonance-state basis of the considered system, leading to a\ntransparent interpretation of the numerical results. This manuscript is\nintended to extend the study of QNM expansion formalism, in particular, and\nnonlinear spectral theory, in general. At the same time, several numerical\nmodelings are provided as examples for the application of modal expansion in\ncomputations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2020 19:16:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Oct 2020 21:05:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-28"}

A critical step for this issue is to decompose features in different\nscales and to merge them separately. In this paper, we propose a novel\ndual-stream auto-encoder (AE) based fusion network. The core idea is that the\nencoder decomposes an image into base and detail feature maps with low- and\nhigh-frequency information, respectively, and that the decoder is responsible\nfor the original image reconstruction. To this end, a well-designed loss\nfunction is established to make the base/detail feature maps\nsimilar/dissimilar. In the test phase, base and detail feature maps are\nrespectively merged via an additional fusion layer, which contains a saliency\nweighted-based spatial attention module and a channel attention module to\nadaptively preserve more information from source images and to highlight the\nobjects. Then the fused image is recovered by the decoder. Qualitative and\nquantitative results demonstrate that our method can generate fusion images\ncontaining highlighted targets and abundant detail texture information with\nstrong reproducibility and meanwhile is superior to the state-of-the-art (SOTA)\napproaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2020 19:32:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 12:24:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-15"}

However, the carrier mobility in NP solar cells,\nand in other optoelectronic applications remains low, thus critically limiting\ntheir performance. Therefore, carrier transport in NP solids needs to be better\nunderstood to further improve the overall efficiency of NP solar cell\ntechnology. However, it is technically challenging to simulate experimental\nscale samples, as physical processes from atomic to mesoscopic scales all\ncrucially impact transport. To rise to this challenge, here we report the\ndevelopment of TRIDENS: the Transport in Defected Nanoparticle Solids\nSimulator, that adds three more hierarchical layers to our previously developed\nHINTS code for nanoparticle solar cells. In TRIDENS, we first introduced planar\ndefects, such as twin planes and grain boundaries into individual NP SLs that\ncomprised the order of 10^3 NPs. Then we used HINTS to simulate the transport\nacross tens of thousands of defected NP SLs, and constructed the distribution\nof the NP SL mobilities with planar defects. Second, the defected NP SLs were\nassembled into a resistor network with more than 10^4 NP SLs, thus representing\nabout 10^7 individual NPs. Finally, the TRIDENS results were analyzed by finite\nsize scaling to explore whether the percolation transition, separating the\nphase where the low mobility defected NP SLs percolate, from the phase where\nthe high mobility undefected NP SLs percolate drives a\nlow-mobility-to-high-mobility transport crossover that can be extrapolated to\nmacroscopic length scales. For the theoretical description, we adapted the\nEfros-Shklovskii bimodal mobility distribution percolation model. We\ndemonstrated that the ES bimodal theory's two-variable scaling function is an\neffective tool to quantitatively characterize this\nlow-mobility-to-high-mobility transport crossover.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2020 19:40:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Mar 2021 21:10:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-11"}

An\nasymmetry in the error of the final state was observed that increased with the\ncircuit depth. The strength and direction of the asymmetry was unique but\nrepeatable for each pair of coupled qubits tested. This observation suggests\nthat the asymmetry in CNOT implementation should be characterized for the\nqubits of interest and incorporated into circuit transpilation to obtain the\nbest accuracy for a particular computation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2020 20:42:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-04"}

The total product abundances corresponded to 5-10% of the\ninitial CO molecules exposed to the electron irradiation.

Understanding and predicting human\nmobility patterns, such as destination and trajectory selection, can inform\nemerging congestion and road closures raised by disruptions in emergencies.\nData related to human movement trajectories are scarce, especially in the\ncontext of emergencies, which places a limitation on applications of existing\nurban mobility models learned from empirical data. Models with the capability\nof learning the mobility patterns from data generated in normal situations and\nwhich can adapt to emergency situations are needed to inform emergency response\nand urban resilience assessments. To address this gap, this study creates and\ntests an adaptive reinforcement learning model that can predict the\ndestinations of movements, estimate the trajectory for each origin and\ndestination pair, and examine the impact of perturbations on humans' decisions\nrelated to destinations and movement trajectories. The application of the\nproposed model is shown in the context of Houston and the flooding scenario\ncaused by Hurricane Harvey in August 2017.

The mirror tracking system of the Canadian Automated Meteor\nObservatory (CAMO) can track meteors in real time, providing an effective\nangular resolution of 1 arc second and a temporal resolution of 100 frames per\nsecond.\n  Aims. We describe the upgraded hardware and give details of the data\ncalibration and reduction pipeline. We investigate the influence of meteor\nmorphology on radiant and velocity measurement precision, and use direct\nobservations of meteoroid fragmentation to constrain their compressive\nstrengths.\n  Methods. On July 21, 2017, CAMO observed a ~4 second meteor on a JFC orbit.\nIt had a shallow entry angle ~8 deg and 12 fragments were visible in the\nnarrow-field video. The event was manually reduced and the exact moment of\nfragmentation was determined. The aerodynamic ram pressure at the moment of\nfragmentation was used as a proxy for compressive strength, and strengths of an\nadditional 19 fragmenting meteoroids were measured in the same way. The\nuncertainty in the atmosphere mass density was estimated to be +/-25% using\nNAVGEM-HA data.\n  Results. We find that meteor trajectory accuracy significantly depends on\nmeteor morphology. The CAMO radiant and initial velocity precision for\nnon-fragmenting meteors with short wakes is ~0.5' and 1 m/s, while that for\nmeteors with fragments or long wakes is similar to non-tracking, moderate field\nof view optical systems (5', ~50 m/s). Measured compressive strengths of 20\nfragmenting meteoroids (with less precise radiants due to their morphology) was\nin the range of 1-4 kPa, which is in excellent accord with Rosetta in-situ\nmeasurements of 67P.

T2- or\nT2*-weighted images are used to delineate the largest nigrosome, named\nnigrosome-1. In these images, nigrosome-1 is a hyperintense region in the\ncaudal and dorsal portion of the T2- or T2*-weighted substantia nigra. In PD,\nnigrosome-1 experiences iron accumulation, which leads to a reduction in\nT2-weighted hyperintensity. Here, we examine neuromelanin-depletion and iron\ndeposition in regions of interest (ROIs) derived from quantitative-voxel based\nmorphometry (qVBM) on neuromelanin-sensitive images and compare the ROIs with\nnigrosome-1 identified in T2*-weighted images.\n  Methods: Neuromelanin-sensitive and multi-echo gradient echo imaging data\nwere obtained.

Recent findings, however, suggest that neural networks rely on\nlucky random initial weights of subnetworks called \"lottery tickets\" that\nconverge quickly to a solution. To investigate how weight initializations\naffect performance, we examine small convolutional networks that are trained to\npredict n steps of the two-dimensional cellular automaton Conway's Game of\nLife, the update rules of which can be implemented efficiently in a 2n+1 layer\nconvolutional network. We find that networks of this architecture trained on\nthis task rarely converge. Rather, networks require substantially more\nparameters to consistently converge. In addition, near-minimal architectures\nare sensitive to tiny changes in parameters: changing the sign of a single\nweight can cause the network to fail to learn. Finally, we observe a critical\nvalue d_0 such that training minimal networks with examples in which cells are\nalive with probability d_0 dramatically increases the chance of convergence to\na solution. We conclude that training convolutional neural networks to learn\nthe input/output function represented by n steps of Game of Life exhibits many\ncharacteristics predicted by the lottery ticket hypothesis, namely, that the\nsize of the networks required to learn this function are often significantly\nlarger than the minimal network required to implement the function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Sep 2020 00:47:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-04"}

Therefore, object-level retrieval becomes intractable without\nbounding-box annotation, which leads to a new but challenging topic, i.e.\nimage-level search. In this paper, to address the image search issue, we first\nintroduce an end-to-end Integrated Net (I-Net), which has three merits: 1) A\nSiamese architecture and an on-line pairing strategy for similar and dissimilar\nobjects in the given images are designed. 2) A novel on-line pairing (OLP) loss\nis introduced with a dynamic feature dictionary, which alleviates the\nmulti-task training stagnation problem, by automatically generating a number of\nnegative pairs to restrict the positives. 3) A hard example priority (HEP)\nbased softmax loss is proposed to improve the robustness of classification task\nby selecting hard categories.

Existing two-stage solutions\nmostly focus on the grounding step, which aims to align the expressions with\nthe proposals. In this paper, we argue that these methods overlook an obvious\nmismatch between the roles of proposals in the two stages: they generate\nproposals solely based on the detection confidence (i.e., expression-agnostic),\nhoping that the proposals contain all right instances in the expression (i.e.,\nexpression-aware). Due to this mismatch, current two-stage methods suffer from\na severe performance drop between detected and ground-truth proposals. To this\nend, we propose Ref-NMS, which is the first method to yield expression-aware\nproposals at the first stage. Ref-NMS regards all nouns in the expression as\ncritical objects, and introduces a lightweight module to predict a score for\naligning each box with a critical object. These scores can guide the NMS\noperation to filter out the boxes irrelevant to the expression, increasing the\nrecall of critical objects, resulting in a significantly improved grounding\nperformance. Since Ref- NMS is agnostic to the grounding step, it can be easily\nintegrated into any state-of-the-art two-stage method.

Moreover, for any fixed $n$,\nwith the increase of $p$, Bell-diagonal states can be completely incoherent\nunder generalized amplitude damping (GAD) channels, depolarization (DEP)\nchannels and phase flip (PF) channels, while this is not the case for bit flip\n(BF) channels and bit-phase flip (BPF) channels. We also investigate the\ngeometry of the relative entropy of coherence and skew information-based\ncoherence of Bell-diagonal states under different channels when the $n$-th\ndecay rate is one, i.e., the coherence is frozen. It is shown that compared\nwith BF and BPF channels, when $n$ is large enough, the coherence of\nBell-diagonal states will not be frozen under GAD, DEP and PF channels. For\nskew information-based coherence, similar properties of coherence freezing are\nfound.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Sep 2020 08:14:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-04"}

With very few exceptions, projection techniques\nare designed to map data from a high-dimensional space to a visual space so as\nto preserve some dissimilarity (similarity) measure, such as the Euclidean\ndistance for example. In fact, although adopting distinct mathematical\nformulations designed to favor different aspects of the data, most\nmultidimensional projection methods strive to preserve dissimilarity measures\nthat encapsulate geometric properties such as distances or the proximity\nrelation between data objects. However, geometric relations are not the only\ninteresting property to be preserved in a projection. For instance, the\nanalysis of particular structures such as clusters and outliers could be more\nreliably performed if the mapping process gives some guarantee as to\ntopological invariants such as connected components and loops. This paper\nintroduces TopoMap, a novel projection technique which provides topological\nguarantees during the mapping process. In particular, the proposed method\nperforms the mapping from a high-dimensional space to a visual space, while\npreserving the 0-dimensional persistence diagram of the Rips filtration of the\nhigh-dimensional data, ensuring that the filtrations generate the same\nconnected components when applied to the original as well as projected data.\nThe presented case studies show that the topological guarantee provided by\nTopoMap not only brings confidence to the visual analytic process but also can\nbe used to assist in the assessment of other projection methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Sep 2020 08:30:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-04"}

Due to the transversality of\nthe holonomous Hard-Thermal-Loop in gluon self-energy, the resummed propagator\nhas a similar Lorentz structure as that in the perturbative Quark-Gluon Plasma\nwhere the holonomy vanishes. As for the color structures, since diagonal gluons\nare mixed in the over-complete double line basis, only the propagators for\noff-diagonal gluons can be obtained unambiguously. On the other hand,\nmultiplied by a projection operator, the propagators for diagonal gluons, which\nexhibit a highly non-trivial dependence on the background field, are uniquely\ndetermined after summing over the color indices. As an application of these\nresults, we consider the Debye screening effect on the in-medium binding of\nquarkonium states by analyzing the static limit of the resummed gluon\npropagator.

The chromospheric field is\nobtained from a spatially-regularised weak field approximation (WFA) and\nnon-LTE inversions of Ca II 8542{\\AA} observed with CRISP at the Swedish 1-m\nSolar Telescope. The LTE- and non-LTE-inferred photospheric field components\nare strongly correlated throughout the atmosphere, with stronger field and\nhigher temperatures in the non-LTE inversions. For the chromospheric field, the\nnon-LTE inversions correlate well with the spatially-regularised WFA. We find\nstrong-field patches of over 4.5 kG in the photosphere, co-located with similar\nconcentrations exceeding 3 kG in the chromosphere. The obtained field strengths\nare up to 2-3 times higher than in the numerical models, with more concentrated\nand structured photosphere-to-chromosphere shear close to the polarity\ninversion line. The LTE and non-LTE Fe I inversions yield essentially the same\nphotospheric field, while ME inversions fail to reproduce the field vector\norientation where Fe I is in emission. Our inversions confirm the locations of\nflux rope footpoints that are predicted by numerical models. However,\npre-processing and lower spatial resolution lead to weaker and smoother field\nin the models than what the data indicate. This emphasises the need for higher\nspatial resolution in the models to better constrain pre-eruptive flux ropes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Sep 2020 09:27:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-04"}

Additionally, in the RL setting, hyperparameter\noptimization (HPO) requires a large number of environment interactions,\nhindering the transfer of the successes in RL to real-world applications. In\nthis work, we tackle the issues of sample-efficient and dynamic HPO in RL. We\npropose a population-based automated RL (AutoRL) framework to meta-optimize\narbitrary off-policy RL algorithms. In this framework, we optimize the\nhyperparameters and also the neural architecture while simultaneously training\nthe agent. By sharing the collected experience across the population, we\nsubstantially increase the sample efficiency of the meta-optimization. We\ndemonstrate the capabilities of our sample-efficient AutoRL approach in a case\nstudy with the popular TD3 algorithm in the MuJoCo benchmark suite, where we\nreduce the number of environment interactions needed for meta-optimization by\nup to an order of magnitude compared to population-based training.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Sep 2020 10:04:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 2020 09:49:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 17 Mar 2021 14:43:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-18"}

This 'interchange\nreconnection' is expected to be particularly active at the open-closed\nboundaries of coronal holes (CHs). Previous analysis of solar wind data at 1AU\nindicated that peaks in the flux of suprathermal electrons at slow-fast stream\ninterfaces may arise from magnetic connection to the CH boundary, rather than\ndynamic effects such as compression. Further, offsets between the peak and\nstream interface locations are suggested to be the result of interchange\nreconnection at the source. As a preliminary test of these suggestions, we\nanalyse two solar wind streams observed during the first Parker Solar Probe\n(PSP) perihelion encounter, each associated with equatorial CH boundaries (one\nleading and one trailing with respect to rotation). Each stream features a peak\nin suprathermal electron flux, the locations and associated plasma properties\nof which are indicative of a solar origin, in agreement with previous\nsuggestions from 1AU observations. Discrepancies between locations of the flux\npeaks and other features suggest these peaks may too be shifted by source\nregion interchange reconnection. Our interpretation of each event is compatible\nwith a global pattern of open flux transport, although random footpoint motions\nor other explanations remain feasible. These exploratory results highlight\nfuture opportunities for statistical studies regarding interchange reconnection\nand flux transport at CH boundaries with modern near-Sun missions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Sep 2020 10:08:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-04"}

We carried out experiments\nto evaluate the proposed methods in the task of surface defect detection using\ndifferent datasets from DAGM2007. We show that the use of Convolutional Neural\nNetworks achieves better results than traditional methods, and also, that\nAuto-Classifier out-performs all other methods, by achieving 100% accuracy and\n100% AUC results throughout all the datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Sep 2020 10:39:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-29"}

Although the characteristics of the different layers in a CNN are\nfrequently quite different, previous hardware designs have employed common\noptimization schemes for them. This paper proposes a layer-specific design that\nemploys different organizations that are optimized for the different layers.\nThe proposed design employs two layer-specific optimizations: layer-specific\nmixed data flow and layer-specific mixed precision. The mixed data flow aims to\nminimize the off-chip access while demanding a minimal on-chip memory (BRAM)\nresource of an FPGA device. The mixed precision quantization is to achieve both\na lossless accuracy and an aggressive model compression, thereby further\nreducing the off-chip access. A Bayesian optimization approach is used to\nselect the best sparsity for each layer, achieving the best trade-off between\nthe accuracy and compression. This mixing scheme allows the entire network\nmodel to be stored in BRAMs of the FPGA to aggressively reduce the off-chip\naccess, and thereby achieves a significant performance enhancement. The model\nsize is reduced by 22.66-28.93 times compared to that in a full-precision\nnetwork with a negligible degradation of accuracy on VOC, COCO, and ImageNet\ndatasets.

Experiments are prospectively conducted on the 2020\nComputational Precision Medicine challenge, in a 3-classes unbalanced\nclassification task. We report cross-validation (resp. validation)\nbalanced-accuracy, kappa and f1 of 0.913, 0.897 and 0.951 (resp. 0.91, 0.90 and\n0.94).

Non-minimal couplings of both scalars\nto gravity were included. The coupling channels between the ordinary and dark\nmatter sectors were kinetic mixing between the electromagnetic and dark $U(1)$\nfields and the Higgs portal coupling among the scalars. The structures of\nemerging singular spacetimes were either of Schwarzschild or\nReissner-Nordstr\\\"{o}m types.

Although\nthe cloud providers are responsible for the security of the cloud, there are\nstill many security concerns due to inherently complex model the cloud\nproviders operate on (e.g.,multi-tenancy). In addition, the enterprises whose\nservices have migrated into the cloud have a preference for their own\ncybersecurity situation awareness capability on top of the security mechanisms\nprovided by the cloud providers. In this way, the enterprises can monitor the\nperformance of the security offerings of the cloud and have a choice to decide\nand select potential response strategies more appropriate to the enterprise in\nthe presence of the attack where the defense provided by the cloud doesn't work\nfor them.

We shall\nalso show how to deduce comparison principles for nonlinear differential\noperators, a program seemingly different from the first. However, we shall\nmarry these two points of view, for a wide variety of equations, under\nsomething called the correspondence principle. In potential theory one is given\na constraint set F on the 2-jets of a function, and the boundary of F gives a\ndifferential equation. There are many differential operators, suitably\norganized around F, which give the same equation. So potential theory gives a\ngreat strengthening and simplification to the operator theory. Conversely, the\nset of operators associated to F can have much to say about the potential\ntheory. An object of central interest here is that of monotonicity, which\nexplains and unifies much of the theory. We shall always assume that the\nmaximal monotonicity cone for a potential theory has interior. This is\nautomatic for gradient-free equations where monotonicity is simply the standard\ndegenerate ellipticity and properness assumptions. We show that for each such\npotential theory F there is an associated canonical operator, defined on the\nentire 2-jet space and having all the desired properties. Furthermore,\ncomparison holds for this operator on any domain which admits a regular\nstrictly M-subharmonic function, where M is a monotonicity subequation for F.\nOn the operator side there is an important dichotomy into the unconstrained\ncases and constrained cases, where the operator must be restricted to a proper\nsubset of 2-jet space. These two cases are best illustrated by the canonical\noperators and Dirichlet-Garding operators, respectively. The article gives\nmany, many examples from pure and applied mathematics, and also from\ntheoretical physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Sep 2020 12:35:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-04"}

The method is based on the use of cross-dispersion\nspectrographs to determine the position of the centroid of the spatial profile\nat each wavelength of each spectral order. The method is validated using\ncross-dispersed spectroscopic data acquired with the slit spectrograph UVES. We\nmeasure an instrumental dispersion of 47 mas in the blue arm, 15 mas, and 23\nmas in the two ranges of the red arm. We also measure a 4 % deviation in the\npixel scale from the value cited in UVES manual. The accuracy of the method is\n~ 17 mas in the range of 315-665 nm. At this level, we can compare and\ncharacterize different atmospheric dispersion models for better future ADC\ndesigns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Sep 2020 13:07:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-14"}

But\ntheir most substantial changes occur off the MS stage, either before on the\npre-MS or beyond at the post-MS phase. Due to very complex and varied dynamical\nprocesses, the evolution of planetary systems orbiting non-MS stars\nsignificantly differs from those of MS planetary systems.\n  This work focusses on the search for sub-stellar companions in post-MS\nsystems146 and determination of the evolutionary state of their host stars,\nespecially subdwarf B stars (sdB stars). The canonical model involves binary\nevolution to explain the existence of sdB stars. Formation scenarios for single\nsdBs are more controversially discussed. Besides the merger of two helium white\ndwarfs or other merger processes for apparently single sdB stars, an\nalternative formation channel involves planetary systems. During the red giant\nphase, the star would develop a common envelope w146ith a giant planet that\nleads to the loss of the envelope. Thus, sdB stars are laboratories to test how\nplanets survive and influence the late phases of stellar evolution.\n  The rapid pulsations of sdB stars can be used to detect sub-stellar\ncompanions from periodic variations in the expected arrival times of the\npulsation maxima. This timing method is particularly sensitive to companions at\nlarge distances and complementary to other exoplanet detection methods. Thus,\nthe timing method opens up a new parameter range in terms of the host stars and\nhelps to understand the formation process of single sdBs.\n  In this work I implemented, tested and applied the pulsation timing analysis\nto search for sub-stellar companions in late evolutionary stage stellar\nsystems. The method is already established in the literature but not to an\nextent which is capable of automatically processing long-time series of\nhigh-cadence data, i.e., from space born observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Sep 2020 13:54:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-04"}

We further refine the graph topology by strengthening intra-class edges\nand reducing node connections between different classes based on cluster\nlabels, which better preserves cluster structures in the embedding space.

In this work, we design ScalAna that uses static\nanalysis techniques to achieve the best of both worlds - it enables the\nanalyzability of traces at a cost similar to profiling. ScalAna first leverages\nstatic compiler techniques to build a Program Structure Graph, which records\nthe main computation and communication patterns as well as the program's\ncontrol structures.

This is\nparticularly important for RANS and LES engine simulations, which often\nstruggle to accurately predict flame propagation and heat release without first\nadjusting model parameters. Detailed measurements of flame transport are\nrequired to guide model development. This work introduces an experimental\ndataset designed to study the detailed flame transport and flame/flow dynamics\nfor SI engines. Simultaneous dual-plane OH-LIF and stereoscopic PIV is used to\nacquire 3D measurements of unburnt gas velocity, flame displacement speed and\noverall flame velocity during the early flame development. Experiments are\nperformed in an optical engine operating at 800 and 1500 RPM with premixed\nC8H18-air mixtures. Analysis reveals several distinctive flame/flow\nconfigurations that yield a positive or negative flame displacement for which\nthe flame progresses towards the reactants or products, respectively. For the\noperating conditions utilized, Sd exhibits and inverse relationship with flame\ncurvature; a strong correlation between negative Sd and convex flame contours\nis observed. Trends are consistent with thermo-diffusive flames, but have not\nbeen quantified in IC engines. Flame wrinkling is more severe at the higher\nRPM, which broadens Sd distribution towards higher positive and negative\nvelocities. Spatially-resolved distributions of Ugas and Sd describe\nin-cylinder locations where convection or thermal diffusion is the dominating\nmechanism contributing to flame transport. Findings are discussed in relation\nto common engine flow features, including flame transport near solid surfaces.\nFindings are designed to support engine simulation validations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Sep 2020 14:41:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-04"}

The limited number of\navailable investigations have focused on non-reacting flows near engine\nsurfaces, while this work focuses on the near-wall flow field dynamics in\nresponse to a propagating flame front. Flow-field and flame distributions were\nmeasured simultaneously at kHz repetition rates using particle tracking\nvelocimetry (PTV) and planar laser induced fluorescence (PLIF) of sulfur\ndioxide (SO2). Measurements were performed near the piston surface of an\noptically accessible engine operating at 800 rpm with homogeneous,\nstoichiometric isooctane-air mixtures.

A conditional analysis is performed to\nanalyze flame/flow dynamics at the piston surface for cycles with weak and\nstrong flow velocities parallel to the surface. Faster flame propagation\nassociated with higher velocities before ignition demonstrates a stronger flow\nacceleration ahead of the flame. Flow acceleration associated with an advancing\nflame front is a transient feature that strongly influences boundary layer\ndevelopment.

For many real-world networks, the true\nconnections consist of events arriving as streams, which are then aggregated to\nform edges, ignoring the dynamic temporal component. A natural way to take\naccount of these temporal dynamics of interactions is to use point processes as\nthe foundation of network models for community detection. Computational\ncomplexity hampers the scalability of such approaches to large sparse networks.\nTo circumvent this challenge, we propose a fast online variational inference\nalgorithm for estimating the latent structure underlying dynamic event arrivals\non a network, using continuous-time point process latent network models. We\ndescribe this procedure for networks models capturing community structure. This\nstructure can be learned as new events are observed on the network, updating\nthe inferred community assignments. We investigate the theoretical properties\nof such an inference scheme, and provide regret bounds on the loss function of\nthis procedure. The proposed inference procedure is then thoroughly compared,\nusing both simulation studies and real data, to non-online variants. We\ndemonstrate that online inference can obtain comparable performance, in terms\nof community recovery, to non-online variants, while realising computational\ngains.

Here, we directly measure the ICD\ntimescale in resonantly excited helium droplets using a high resolution,\ntunable, extreme ultraviolet free electron laser. Over an extensive range of\ndroplet sizes and laser intensities, we discover the decay to be surprisingly\nfast, with decay times as fast as 400 femtoseconds, and to only present a weak\ndependence on the density of the excited states. Using a combination of time\ndependent density functional theory and ab initio quantum chemistry\ncalculations, we elucidate the mechanisms of this ultrafast decay process where\npairs of excited helium atoms in one droplet strongly attract each other and\nform merging void bubbles which drastically accelerates ICD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Sep 2020 15:50:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-15"}

Although the accuracy of semantic segmentation\nin remote sensing images has been increased significantly by deep convolutional\nneural networks, several limitations exist in standard models. First, for\nencoder-decoder architectures such as U-Net, the utilization of multi-scale\nfeatures causes the underuse of information, where low-level features and\nhigh-level features are concatenated directly without any refinement. Second,\nlong-range dependencies of feature maps are insufficiently explored, resulting\nin sub-optimal feature representations associated with each semantic class.\nThird, even though the dot-product attention mechanism has been introduced and\nutilized in semantic segmentation to model long-range dependencies, the large\ntime and space demands of attention impede the actual usage of attention in\napplication scenarios with large-scale input. This paper proposed a\nMulti-Attention-Network (MANet) to address these issues by extracting\ncontextual dependencies through multiple efficient attention modules. A novel\nattention mechanism of kernel attention with linear complexity is proposed to\nalleviate the large computational demand in attention. Based on kernel\nattention and channel attention, we integrate local feature maps extracted by\nResNeXt-101 with their corresponding global dependencies and reweight\ninterdependent channel maps adaptively.

His interpretation, however, is based upon\nsupernatural presuppositions due to which it cannot be accepted as a scientific\nargument. After explaining Craig's view, we attempt to reconstruct his\nexplanation for absolute time using the concept of general substantial motion\nof nature well-known in Mulla Sadra's philosophy as the most important\napproaches in Islamic philosophy, thereby proving general time for the natural\nworld.

The dark stress-energy tensor is\nfound to satisfy an anisotropic structure equation. In vacuum this is shown to\nbe equivalent to a wave equation with sources. A natural class of exact\nsolutions is found which explicitly perturbs any seed spacetime metric by a\nconformal factor satisfying a (1+1)-dimensional wave equation. This leads to\nthe concept of dark coating. The static solutions are then used to construct\nstructures that model dark matter halos surrounding baryonic bodies.

The example of a dark halo on the\nSchwarzschild geometry is made as a toy model for a galaxy. All qualitative an\nquantitative features of galactic rotation curves are recovered. A dark halo\nsurrounding a Schwarzschild black hole is found to possess a boundary of\nstaticity called torsion sphere placed between the photon sphere and the event\nhorizon.

The seller has a set of products available and the VA decides which\nproduct to offer and at what price, seeking to maximize its revenue, consumer-\nor total-surplus. The consumer is impatient and rational, seeking to maximize\nher expected utility given the information available to her. The VA selects\nproducts based on the consumer's request and other information available to it\nand then presents them sequentially. Once a product is presented and priced,\nthe consumer evaluates it and decides whether to make a purchase. The\nconsumer's valuation of each product comprises a pre-evaluation value, which is\ncommon knowledge, and a post-evaluation component which is private to the\nconsumer. We solve for the equilibria and develop efficient algorithms for\nimplementing the solution. We examine the effects of information asymmetry on\nthe outcomes and study how incentive misalignment depends on the distribution\nof private valuations. We find that monotone rankings are optimal in the cases\nof a highly patient or impatient consumer and provide a good approximation for\nother levels of patience. The relationship between products' expected\nvaluations and prices depends on the consumer's patience level and is monotone\nincreasing (decreasing) when the consumer is highly impatient (patient). Also,\nthe seller's share of total surplus decreases in the amount of private\ninformation. We compare the VA to a traditional web-based interface, where\nmultiple products are presented simultaneously on each page. We find that\nwithin a page, the higher-value products are priced lower than the lower-value\nproducts when the private valuations are exponentially distributed. Finally,\nthe web-based interface generally achieves higher profits for the seller than a\nVA due to the greater commitment power inherent in its presentation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2020 22:05:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-09"}

Existing program analysis techniques either suffer from high\nfalse positives or false negatives. Recent progress in Deep Learning (DL) has\nresulted in a surge of interest in applying DL for automated vulnerability\ndetection. Several recent studies have demonstrated promising results achieving\nan accuracy of up to 95% at detecting vulnerabilities. In this paper, we ask,\n\"how well do the state-of-the-art DL-based techniques perform in a real-world\nvulnerability prediction scenario?\". To our surprise, we find that their\nperformance drops by more than 50%. A systematic investigation of what causes\nsuch precipitous performance drop reveals that existing DL-based vulnerability\nprediction approaches suffer from challenges with the training data (e.g., data\nduplication, unrealistic distribution of vulnerable classes, etc.) and with the\nmodel choices (e.g., simple token-based models). As a result, these approaches\noften do not learn features related to the actual cause of the vulnerabilities.\nInstead, they learn unrelated artifacts from the dataset (e.g., specific\nvariable/function names, etc.). Leveraging these empirical findings, we\ndemonstrate how a more principled approach to data collection and model design,\nbased on realistic settings of vulnerability prediction, can lead to better\nsolutions. The resulting tools perform significantly better than the studied\nbaseline: up to 33.57% boost in precision and 128.38% boost in recall compared\nto the best performing model in the literature. Overall, this paper elucidates\nexisting DL-based vulnerability prediction systems' potential issues and draws\na roadmap for future DL-based vulnerability prediction research.

The proof is divided into two\nsteps. In the first step the Lam\\'e system with a special version of the\nconvective term is considered. The system has two viscosities. Assuming that\nthe second viscosity (the bulk one) is sufficiently large we are able to prove\nthe existence of global regular solutions to this system. The proof is divided\ninto two steps. First the long time existence in interval $(0,T)$ is proved,\nwhere $T$ is proportional to the bulk viscosity. Having the bulk viscosity\nlarge we are able to show that data at time $T$ are sufficiently small. Then by\nthe small data arguments a global existence follows. In this paper we are\nrestricted to derive appropriate estimates only. To prove the existence we\nshould use the method of successive approximations and the continuation\nargument.

In low-textured scenarios, however, it is difficult to find\nenough point features and, hence, the performance of these solutions drops\ndrastically. An alternative for human-made scenarios, due to their structural\nregularity, is the use of geometrical cues such as straight segments,\nfrequently present within these environments. Under this context, in this paper\nwe introduce LiPo-LCD, a novel appearance-based loop closure detection method\nthat integrates lines and points. Adopting the idea of incremental\nBag-of-Binary-Words schemes, we build separate BoW models for each feature, and\nuse them to retrieve previously seen images using a late fusion strategy.\nAdditionally, a simple but effective mechanism, based on the concept of island,\ngroups similar images close in time to reduce the image candidate search\neffort. A final step validates geometrically the loop candidates by\nincorporating the detected lines by means of a process comprising a line\nfeature matching stage, followed by a robust spatial verification stage, now\ncombining both lines and points. As it is reported in the paper, LiPo-LCD\ncompares well with several state-of-the-art solutions for a number of datasets\ninvolving different environmental conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Sep 2020 10:43:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-22"}

Although recently detected in the far-field regime,\noptical near-fields of this mode are yet to be observed and characterized.\nDirect optical probing of the plasmonic fields reflected by the edges of\ngraphene via near-field scattering microscope reveals a relatively small\ndamping rate of the mid-IR acoustic plasmons in our devices, which allows for\ntheir real-space mapping even with unprotected, chemically grown, large-area\ngraphene at ambient conditions.
