For nonlinear ROMs, it is not\nonly important to show that the origin is locally asymptotically stable, but\nalso to quantify if the operative range of the ROM is included in the region of\nconvergence. While accuracy and structure preservation remain the main focus of\ndevelopment for nonlinear ROMs, computational methods that go beyond the\nexisting highly conservative analytical results have been lacking thus far. In\nthis work, for a given quadratic Lyapunov function, we first derive an\nanalytical estimate of the stability domain, which is rather conservative but\ncan be evaluated efficiently. With the goal to enlarge this estimate, we\nprovide an optimal ellipsoidal estimate of the stability domain by solving a\nconvex optimization problem. This provides us with valuable information about\nstability properties of the ROM, an important aspect of predictive simulation.\nWe do not assume a specific ROM method, so a particular appeal is that the\napproach is applicable to quadratic-bilinear models obtained via data-driven\napproaches, where ROM stability properties cannot - per definition - be derived\nfrom the full-order model. Numerical results for a LQG-balanced ROM of Burgers'\nequation, a proper orthogonal decomposition ROM of FitzHugh-Nagumo, and a\nnon-intrusive ROM of Burgers' equation demonstrate the scalability and\nquantitative advantages of the proposed approach. The optimization-based\nestimates of the stability domain are found to be up to four orders of\nmagnitude less conservative than analytical estimates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Sep 2020 16:22:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 21 Feb 2021 17:53:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-23"}

Mathematically, this process is an inverse problem. Furthermore,\nelectromyographic data are highly sensitive to changes in the electrical\nconductivity that describes the structure of the tissue. Modeling the\ninevitable measurement error as a stochastic quantity leads to a Bayesian\napproach. Solving the discretized Bayes-inverse problem means drawing samples\nfrom the posterior distribution of parameters, e.g., the conductivity, given\nmeasurement data. Using, e.g., a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for this purpose\ninvolves solving the forward problem for different parameter combinations which\nrequires a high computational effort. Low-rank tensor formats can reduce this\neffort by providing a data-sparse representation of all occurring linear\nsystems of equations simultaneously and allow for their efficient solution. The\napplication of Bayes' theorem proves the well-posedness of the Bayes-inverse\nproblem.

To achieve this, we first propose a novel concrete semantics for\nDRF programs, called L-DRF, that is thread-local in nature---each thread\noperates on its own copy of the data state. We show that abstractions of our\nsemantics allow us to reduce the analysis of DRF programs to a sequential\nanalysis. This aids in rapidly porting existing sequential analyses to sound\nand scalable analyses for DRF programs.

In this paper,\nwe prove a more scalable version of his result: given any error correcting code\n$C$ over alphabet $[q]$, rate $\\rho$, and relative distance $\\delta$, we use\n$C$ to create a reduction from the $(k,k+1)$-SetCover problem on universe $U$\nto the $\\left(k,\\sqrt[2k]{\\frac{2}{1-\\delta}}\\right)$-SetCover problem on\nuniverse of size $\\frac{\\log|\\mathcal{S}|}{\\rho}\\cdot|U|^{q^k}$.\n  Lin established his result by composing the input SetCover instance (that has\nno gap) with a special threshold graph constructed from extremal combinatorial\nobject called universal sets, resulting in a final SetCover instance with gap.\nOur reduction follows along the exact same lines, except that we generate the\nthreshold graphs specified by Lin simply using the basic properties of the\nerror correcting code $C$.\n  We use the same threshold graphs mentioned above to prove inapproximability\nresults, under W[1]$\\neq$FPT and ETH, for the $k$-MaxCover problem introduced\nby Chalermsook et al. (SICOMP'20). Our inapproximaiblity results match the\nbounds obtained by Karthik et al.

Moreover, the music\none user may prefer in a given context may be different from what another user\nprefers in the same context (i.e., what is considered good morning music\ndiffers across users). Accurately representing these preferences is essential\nto creating accurate and effective song recommendations.

Some of the important universal results of lattice\nsimulation during preheating have been considered as crucial inputs in our\ntwo-phase dynamics. In this framework, detailed phenomenological constraints\nhave been obtained on the inflaton couplings with reheating fields, and dark\nmatter parameters in terms of CMB constrained inflationary scalar spectral\nindex. It is observed that the conventional reheating scenario generically\npredicts the maximum reheating temperature $T_{re}^{max} \\simeq 10^{15}$ GeV,\ncorresponding to an almost instantaneous transition from the end of inflation\nto radiation domination. This fact will naturally lead to the problem of\nnon-perturbative inflaton decay, which is in direct conflict with the\nperturbative reheating itself. Taking into account this by incorporating\neffective non-perturbative dynamics as the initial phase, our model of\ntwo-phase reheating scenarios also predicts model-independent maximum reheating\ntemperature, which does not correspond to the instantaneous process. Further,\n$T_{re}^{max}$ is predicted to lie within $(10^{13}, 10^{10})$ GeV if CMB\nconstraints on inflaton couplings with different reheating field are taken into\naccount. We have further studied in detail the dark matter phenomenology in a\nmodel-independent manner and show how dark matter parameter space can be\nconstrained through CMB parameters via the inflaton spectral index.

Contrast-agent free approaches, for example,\nbased on intravoxel incoherent motion, also exist, but are so far not routinely\nused clinically. These methods rely on estimating on the arterial input\nfunction (AIF) to approximately model tissue perfusion, neglecting spatial\ndependencies, and reliably estimating the AIF is also non-trivial, leading to\ndifficulties with standardizing perfusion measures. In this work we therefore\npropose a data-assimilation approach (PIANO) which estimates the velocity and\ndiffusion fields of an advection-diffusion model that best explains the\ncontrast dynamics. PIANO accounts for spatial dependencies and neither requires\nestimating the AIF nor relies on a particular contrast agent bolus shape.\nSpecifically, we propose a convenient parameterization of the estimation\nproblem, a numerical estimation approach, and extensively evaluate PIANO.

Recently, a novel area of research has\napplied this paradigm to unsupervised tasks; indeed, a gradient-based approach\nextracts, efficiently and autonomously, the relevant features for handling\ninput data. However, state-of-the-art techniques focus mostly on algorithmic\nefficiency and accuracy rather than mimic the input manifold. On the contrary,\ncompetitive learning is a powerful tool for replicating the input distribution\ntopology. This paper introduces a novel perspective in this area by combining\nthese two techniques: unsupervised gradient-based and competitive learning. The\ntheory is based on the intuition that neural networks are able to learn\ntopological structures by working directly on the transpose of the input\nmatrix. At this purpose, the vanilla competitive layer and its dual are\npresented. The former is just an adaptation of a standard competitive layer for\ndeep clustering, while the latter is trained on the transposed matrix. Their\nequivalence is extensively proven both theoretically and experimentally.\nHowever, the dual layer is better suited for handling very high-dimensional\ndatasets. The proposed approach has a great potential as it can be generalized\nto a vast selection of topological learning tasks, such as non-stationary and\nhierarchical clustering; furthermore, it can also be integrated within more\ncomplex architectures such as autoencoders and generative adversarial networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Sep 2020 19:00:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-08"}

This task has often been\ncompared to speech perception as it brings about similar topographical\nactivation patterns in common brain areas. In studies of speech comprehension,\nneural oscillations are thought to play a key role in the sampling of speech at\nvarying temporal scales. However, very little is known about the role of\noscillations in covert speech. In this study, we aimed to determine to what\nextent each oscillatory frequency band is used to process words in covert\nspeech and speech perception tasks. Secondly, we asked whether the {\\theta} and\n{\\gamma} activity in the two tasks are related through phase-amplitude coupling\n(PAC). First, continuous wavelet transform was performed on epoched signals and\nsubsequently two-tailed t-tests between two classes were conducted to determine\nstatistical distinctions in frequency and time. While the perception task\ndynamically uses all frequencies with more prominent {\\theta} and {\\gamma}\nactivity, the covert task favoured higher frequencies with significantly higher\n{\\gamma} activity than perception. Moreover, the perception condition produced\nsignificant {\\theta}-{\\gamma} PAC suggesting a linkage of syllabic and\nphonological sampling. Although this was found to be suppressed in the covert\ncondition, we found significant pseudo-coupling between perception {\\theta} and\ncovert speech {\\gamma}. We report that covert speech processing is largely\nconducted by higher frequencies, and that the {\\gamma}- and {\\theta}-bands may\nfunction similarly and differently across tasks, respectively.

Unsupervised domain adaptation aims to improve network\nperformance when applying robust models trained on medical images from source\ndomains to a new target domain. In this work, we present an approach based on\nthe Wasserstein distance guided disentangled representation to achieve 3D\nmulti-domain liver segmentation. Concretely, we embed images onto a shared\ncontent space capturing shared feature-level information across domains and\ndomain-specific appearance spaces. The existing mutual information-based\nrepresentation learning approaches often fail to capture complete\nrepresentations in multi-domain medical imaging tasks. To mitigate these\nissues, we utilize Wasserstein distance to learn more complete representation,\nand introduces a content discriminator to further facilitate the representation\ndisentanglement. Experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art on the multi-modality liver segmentation task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Sep 2020 23:48:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-08"}

First, the value of non-causal context using a\nnon-causal FIR filter is shown by comparing the contributions of previous vs.\nfuture information. Second, MLP- and LSTM-based dereverberation networks were\ntrained to confirm the effects of causal and non-causal context when used in\nASR systems trained with clean speech. The non-causal deep-learning-based\ndereverberation provides a 45% relative reduction in word error rate (WER)\ncompared to the popular weighted prediction error (WPE) method in experiments\nwith clean training in the REVERB challenge. Finally, an expanded\nmulticondition training procedure used in combination with a semi-enhanced test\nutterance generation based on combinations of reverberated and dereverberated\nsignals is proposed to reduce any artifacts or distortion that may be\nintroduced by the non-causal dereverberation methods.

However, BERT cannot well\nsupport E-commerce related tasks due to the lack of two levels of domain\nknowledge, i.e., phrase-level and product-level. On one hand, many E-commerce\ntasks require an accurate understanding of domain phrases, whereas such\nfine-grained phrase-level knowledge is not explicitly modeled by BERT's\ntraining objective. On the other hand, product-level knowledge like product\nassociations can enhance the language modeling of E-commerce, but they are not\nfactual knowledge thus using them indiscriminately may introduce noise. To\ntackle the problem, we propose a unified pre-training framework, namely,\nE-BERT. Specifically, to preserve phrase-level knowledge, we introduce Adaptive\nHybrid Masking, which allows the model to adaptively switch from learning\npreliminary word knowledge to learning complex phrases, based on the fitting\nprogress of two modes. To utilize product-level knowledge, we introduce\nNeighbor Product Reconstruction, which trains E-BERT to predict a product's\nassociated neighbors with a denoising cross attention layer.

RAIs estimate the risk of an adverse outcome such as recidivism or\nchild neglect, potentially informing high-stakes decisions such as whether to\nrelease a defendant on bail or initiate a child welfare investigation. It is\nimportant to ensure that RAIs are fair, so that the benefits and harms of such\ndecisions are equitably distributed.\n  The most widely used algorithmic fairness criteria are formulated with\nrespect to observable outcomes, such as whether a person actually recidivates,\nbut these criteria are misleading when applied to RAIs. Since RAIs are intended\nto inform interventions that can reduce risk, the prediction itself affects the\ndownstream outcome. Recent work has argued that fairness criteria for RAIs\nshould instead utilize potential outcomes, i.e. the outcomes that would occur\nin the absence of an appropriate intervention. However, no methods currently\nexist to satisfy such fairness criteria.\n  In this paper, we target one such criterion, counterfactual equalized odds.\nWe develop a post-processed predictor that is estimated via doubly robust\nestimators, extending and adapting previous post-processing approaches to the\ncounterfactual setting. We also provide doubly robust estimators of the risk\nand fairness properties of arbitrary fixed post-processed predictors. Our\npredictor converges to an optimal fair predictor at fast rates.

We introduce a method in\nwhich detection of only one of the particles is required to characterize the\nentanglement of a two-particle mixed state. Our method is based on the\nprinciple of quantum interference. We use two identical sources of a two-photon\nmixed state and generate a set of single-photon interference patterns. The\nentanglement of the two-photon quantum state is characterized by the visibility\nof the interference patterns. Our experiment thus opens up a distinct avenue\nfor verifying and measuring entanglement, and can allow for mixed state\nentanglement characterization even when one particle in the pair cannot be\ndetected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Sep 2020 01:44:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Dec 2022 17:23:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-02"}

Our protocol is a fully decentralized routing\nprotocol. To reduce the space requirement for routing, each node maintains a\nsummarized routing table.

Predicting this chemical composition theoretically is a crucial step\nin linking observational studies to the underlying physics that govern planet\nformation. As a follow-up to a study of hot Jupiters in our previous work, we\npresent a population of warm Jupiters (semi-major axis between 0.5-4 AU)\nextracted from the same planetesimal formation population synthesis model as\nused in our previous work. We compute the astrochemical evolution of the\nprotoplanetary disks included in this population to predict the\ncarbon-to-oxygen (C/O) and nitrogen-to-oxygen (N/O) ratio evolution of the disk\ngas, ice, and refractory sources, the accretion of which greatly impacts the\nresulting C/O and N/O in the atmosphere of giant planets. We confirm that the\nmain sequence (between accreted solid mass and atmospheric C/O) we found\npreviously is largely reproduced by the presented population of synthetic warm\nJupiters. And as a result, the majority of the population fall along the\nempirically derived mass-metallicity relation when the natal disk has solar or\nlower metallicity. Planets forming from disks with high metallicity ([Fe/H] $>$\n0.1) result in more scatter in chemical properties which could explain some of\nthe scatter found in the mass-metallicity relation. Combining predicted C/O and\nN/O ratios shows that Jupiter does not fall among our population of synthetic\nplanets, suggesting that it likely did not form in the inner 5 AU of the solar\nsystem before proceeding into a Grand Tack.

The scheme achieves its compactness due to the time-dependent gas\ndistribution function in GKS, which provides not only the fluxes but also the\ntime accurate flow variables in the next time level at a cell interface. As a\nresult, the cell averaged first-order spatial derivatives of flow variables can\nbe obtained naturally through the Gauss's theorem. Then, a third-order compact\nreconstruction involving the cell averaged values and their first-order spatial\nderivatives can be achieved. The trilinear interpolation is used to treat\npossible non-coplanar elements on general hexahedral mesh. The constrained\nleast-square technique is applied to improve the accuracy in the smooth case.\nTo deal with both smooth and discontinuous flows, a new HWENO reconstruction is\ndesigned in the current scheme by following the ideas in Zhu, 2018. No\nidentification of troubled cells is needed in the current scheme. In contrast\nto the Riemann solver-based method, the compact scheme can achieve a\nthird-order temporal accuracy with the two-stage two-derivative temporal\ndiscretization, instead of the three-stage Runge-Kutta method. Overall, the\nproposed scheme inherits the high accuracy and efficiency of the previous ones\nin two-dimensional case. The desired third-order accuracy can be obtained with\ncurved boundary. The robustness of the scheme has been validated through many\ncases, including strong shocks in both inviscid and viscous flow computations.\nQuantitative comparisons for both smooth and discontinuous cases show that the\ncurrent third-order scheme can give competitive results against the fifth-order\nnon-compact GKS under the same mesh. A large CFL number around 0.5 can be used\nin the present scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Sep 2020 06:57:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-08"}

The\ntrue spectrum of a physical quantity is deformed by the presence of a detector,\nresulting in an observed spectrum. If we discretize both the true and observed\nspectra into histograms, we can model the detector response via a matrix.\nInferring a true spectrum starting from an observed spectrum requires therefore\ninverting the response matrix. Many methods exist in literature for this task,\nall starting from the observed spectrum and using a simulated true spectrum as\na guide to obtain a meaningful solution in cases where the response matrix is\nnot easily invertible.\n  In this Manuscript, I take a different approach to the unfolding problem.\nRather than inverting the response matrix and transforming the observed\ndistribution into the most likely parent distribution in generator space, I\nsample many distributions in generator space, fold them through the original\nresponse matrix, and pick the generator-level distribution that yields the\nfolded distribution closest to the data distribution.

These perturbations\noriginate for instance from neglecting feedback delay, a finite difference\napproximation of the derivative action, or neglecting fast dynamics. The\nanalysis of these potential sensitivity problems leads us to the introduction\nof a `robustified' notion of stability called \\emph{strong stability}, inspired\nby the corresponding notion for neutral functional differential equations. We\nprove that strong stability can be achieved by adding a low-pass filter with a\nsufficiently large cut-off frequency to the control loop, on the condition that\nthe filter itself does not destabilize the nominal closed-loop system.\nThroughout the paper, the theoretical results are illustrated by examples that\ncan be analyzed analytically, including, among others, a third-order unstable\nsystem where both proportional and derivative control action are necessary for\nachieving stability, while the regions in the gain parameter-space for\nstability and strong stability are not identical.

We compare the results of\nthe different ordering variables to existing Monte Carlo shower implementations\non the parton level by analyzing primary Lund planes. Finally, we study the\nsensitivity of quenched jets to the choice of evolution variable by confronting\nour results for a certain key observable, such as the jet mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Sep 2020 08:20:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-23"}

The model includes an\neffective mechanism to transfer the kinetic energy injected by vibration in the\nvertical direction to the horizontal degrees of freedom of grains. The set of\nEnskog kinetic equations for the velocity distribution functions of each\ncomponent is derived first to analyze the homogeneous state. As in the\none-component case, an exact scaling solution is found where the time\ndependence of the distribution functions occurs entirely through the granular\ntemperature $T$. As expected, the kinetic partial temperatures $T_i$ of each\ncomponent are different and hence, energy equipartition is broken down. In the\nsteady state, explicit expressions for the temperature $T$ and the ratio of\npartial kinetic temperatures $T_i/T_j$ are obtained by considering Maxwellian\ndistributions defined at the partial temperatures $T_i$. The (scaled) granular\ntemperature and the temperature ratios are given in terms of the coefficients\nof restitution, the solid volume fraction, the (scaled) parameters of the\ncollisional model, and the ratios of mass, concentration, and diameters. In the\ncase of a binary mixture, the theoretical predictions are exhaustively compared\nwith both direct simulation Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations with\na good agreement. The deviations are identified to be originated in the\nnon-Gaussianity of the velocity distributions and on microsegregation patterns,\nwhich induce spatial correlations not captured in the Enskog theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Sep 2020 09:15:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Sep 2020 09:31:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2020 17:49:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-30"}

Practices\nfor testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection vary geographically in Russia. For\nexample, in the city of St. Petersburg, where mortality rate for COVID-19 is\nthe highest in the Russian Federation on Oct. 25, 2020, every death for\nCOVID-19 corresponds to 15.7 detected cases of COVID-19 in the population,\nwhile the corresponding number for the whole of Russia is 58.1, suggesting\nlimited detection of mild/moderate cases of COVID-19 in St. Petersburg.\nMethods: More active testing for SARS-CoV-2 results in lower case-fatality\nratio (i.e. the proportion of detected COVID-19 cases among all cases of\nSARS-CoV-2 infection in the population). We used data on COVID-19 cases and\ndeaths to examine the correlation between case-fatality ratios and rates of\nmortality for COVID-19 in different regions of the Russian Federation.

We verify that the cosmic censorship conjecture is maintained for\nthe black hole model. Further, we investigate the second-order phase\ntransition, quasinormal modes of perturbation of a test scalar field in the\neikonal limit, and shadow radius for the black hole and find that the\nthermodynamic and dynamic properties depend on the metrics. In this way, we\nconnect the internal structure with the thermodynamics and dynamics for this\nblack hole. Moreover, we compare such a black hole of modified gravity with the\nReissner-Nordstr\\\"om black hole of Einstein's general relativity in these\nthermodynamic and dynamic properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Sep 2020 09:31:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 14:45:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 19 Feb 2021 03:32:24 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 5 Apr 2021 07:15:45 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2022 03:53:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-19"}

We aim to perform consistent comparisons between observations and\nsimulations on the mass dependence of the galaxy major merger fraction at low\nredshift over an unprecedentedly wide range of stellar masses (10^9 to 10^12\nsolar masses).\n  Methods. We first carry out forward modelling of ideal synthetic images of\nmajor mergers and non-mergers selected from the Next Generation Illustris\nSimulations (IllustrisTNG) to include major observational effects. We then\ntrain deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using realistic mock\nobservations of galaxy samples from the simulations.

Based on the major merger\nsamples, which are detected in a consistent manner in the observations and\nsimulations, we determine the dependence of major merger fraction on stellar\nmass at z around 0.15 and make comparisons between the two.\n  Results. The detected major merger fraction in the GAMA/KiDS observations has\na fairly mild decreasing trend with increasing stellar mass over the mass range\n10^9 < M_sun < M_star < 10^11.5 M_sun.

The discrepancy could also be due to the\nrelatively small volume of the simulations and/or differences in how stellar\nmasses are measured in simulations and observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Sep 2020 09:36:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-04"}

We\npresent a method to determine the relative risk of airborne transmission that\ncan be readily deployed with either modelled or monitored CO$_2$ data and\noccupancy levels within an indoor space. For spaces regularly, or consistently,\noccupied by the same group of people, e.g. an open-plan office or a school\nclassroom, we establish protocols to assess the absolute risk of airborne\ninfection of this regular attendance at work or school. We present a\nmethodology to easily calculate the expected number of secondary infections\narising from a regular attendee becoming infectious and remaining\npre/asymptomatic within these spaces. We demonstrate our model by calculating\nrisks for both a modelled open-plan office and by using monitored data recorded\nwithin a small naturally ventilated office. In addition, by inferring\nventilation rates from monitored CO$_2$ we show that estimates of airborne\ninfection can be accurately reconstructed; thereby offering scope for more\ninformed retrospective modelling should outbreaks occur in spaces where CO$_2$\nis monitored. Our modelling suggests that regular attendance at an office for\nwork is unlikely to significantly contribute to the pandemic but only if\nrelatively quiet desk-based work is carried out in the presence of adequate\nventilation (i.e. at least 10\\,l/s/p following UK guidance), appropriate\nhygiene controls, distancing measures, and that all commuting presents minimal\ninfection risk. Crucially, modelling even moderate changes to the conditions\nwithin the office, or basing estimates for the infectivity of the SARS-CoV-2\nvariant B1.1.7 current data, typically results in the prediction that for a\nsingle infector within the office the airborne route alone gives rises to more\nthan one secondary infection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Sep 2020 10:31:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 2021 20:12:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-24"}

We aimed\nfor automatic detection of MSEs with machine learning, i.e. with deep learning\nbased on raw EEG and EOG data as input. We analyzed MWT data of 76 patients.\nExperts visually scored wakefulness, and according to recently developed\nscoring criteria MSEs, microsleep episode candidates (MSEc), and episodes of\ndrowsiness (ED). We implemented segmentation algorithms based on convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs) and a combination of a CNN with a long-short term memory\n(LSTM) network. A LSTM network is a type of a recurrent neural network which\nhas a memory for past events and takes them into account. Data of 53 patients\nwere used for training of the classifiers, 12 for validation and 11 for\ntesting. Our algorithms showed a good performance close to human experts. The\ndetection was very good for wakefulness and MSEs and poor for MSEc and ED,\nsimilar to the low inter-expert reliability for these borderline segments. We\nprovide a proof of principle that it is feasible to reliably detect MSEs with\ndeep neuronal networks based on raw EEG and EOG data with a performance close\nto that of human experts.

What constitutes the content is typically specified by users\nthrough explicit labels in the data, while all unlabeled/unknown factors are\nregarded as style. Recently, it has been shown that such content-labeled data\ncan be effectively exploited by modifying the deep latent factor models (e.g.,\nVAE) such that the style and content are well separated in the latent\nrepresentations. However, the approach assumes that the content factor is\ncategorical-valued (e.g., subject ID in face image data, or digit class in the\nMNIST dataset). In certain situations, the content is ordinal-valued, that is,\nthe values the content factor takes are {\\em ordered} rather than categorical,\nmaking content-labeled VAEs, including the latent space they infer, suboptimal.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel extension of VAE that imposes a partially\nordered set (poset) structure in the content latent space, while simultaneously\nmaking it aligned with the ordinal content values. To this end, instead of the\niid Gaussian latent prior adopted in prior approaches, we introduce a\nconditional Gaussian spacing prior model. This model admits a tractable joint\nGaussian prior, but also effectively places negligible density values on the\ncontent latent configurations that violate the poset constraint. To evaluate\nthis model, we consider two specific ordinal structured problems: estimating a\nsubject's age in a face image and elucidating the calorie amount in a food meal\nimage.

Verbin and Yu [SODA 2011] introduced this problem and showed that any\nsingle-pass streaming algorithm solving it requires $n^{1-\\Omega(\\frac{1}{k})}$\nspace. This result and the technique behind it -- the Boolean Hidden\nHypermatching communication problem -- has since been used extensively for\nproving streaming lower bounds for various problems.\n  Despite its significance and broad range of applications, the lower bound\ntechnique of Verbin and Yu comes with a key weakness that is inherited by all\nsubsequent results: the Boolean Hidden Hypermatching problem is hard only if\nthere is exactly one round of communication and can be solved with logarithmic\ncommunication in two rounds. Therefore, all streaming lower bounds derived from\nthis problem only hold for single-pass algorithms.\n  We prove the first multi-pass lower bound for the gap cycle counting problem:\nAny $p$-pass streaming algorithm that can distinguish between disjoint union of\n$k$-cycles vs $2k$-cycles -- or even $k$-cycles vs one Hamiltonian cycle --\nrequires $n^{1-\\frac{1}{k^{\\Omega(1/p)}}}$ space. As a corollary of this\nresult, we can extend many of previous lower bounds to multi-pass algorithms.\nFor instance, we can now prove that any streaming algorithm that\n$(1+\\epsilon)$-approximates the value of MAX-CUT, maximum matching size, or\nrank of an $n$-by-$n$ matrix, requires either $n^{\\Omega(1)}$ space or\n$\\Omega(\\log{(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon})})$ passes.

In particular, these\nprinciples give rise to the Steinmann relations, which require that the double\ndiscontinuities of scattering amplitudes in partially-overlapping momentum\nchannels vanish. Conversely, at cosmological scales, the imprint of causality\nand unitarity is in general less well understood---the wavefunction of the\nuniverse lives on the future space-like boundary, and has all time evolution\nintegrated out. In the present work, we show how the flat-space Steinmann\nrelations emerge from the structure of the wavefunction of the universe, and\nderive similar relations that apply to the wavefunction itself. This is done\nwithin the context of scalar toy models whose perturbative wavefunction has a\nfirst-principles definition in terms of cosmological polytopes. In particular,\nwe use the fact that the scattering amplitude is encoded in the scattering\nfacet of cosmological polytopes, and that cuts of the amplitude are encoded in\nthe codimension-one boundaries of this facet. As we show, the flat-space\nSteinmann relations are thus implied by the non-existence of codimension-two\nboundaries at the intersection of the boundaries associated with pairs of\npartially-overlapping channels. Applying the same argument to the full\ncosmological polytope, we also derive Steinmann-type constraints that apply to\nthe full wavefunction of the universe.

Then, we linearize the closed-loop system, and we transform the\nmatrix of the resulting system into a class of saddle point matrices to analyze\nthe influence of the control gains, in terms of the oscillations and the rise\ntime, on the transient response of the closed-loop system. Hence, the resulting\ncontrollers stabilize the plant and simultaneously address the performance of\nthe closed-loop system. Moreover, our analysis provides a clear insight into\nhow the kinetic energy, the potential energy, and the damping of the mechanical\nsystem are related to its transient response, endowing in this way the tuning\nrules with a physical interpretation.

In a\nsubgroup, inner holes in these disks can stretch out to a few tens of au while\nthere is still mass accretion onto the central star observed. We analyse the\nproposition that this type of wide transition disks is generated by the\ninteraction of the disk with a system of embedded planets. We performed 2D\nhydrodynamics simulations of a flat disk using either a locally isothermal\nequation of state or considering also radiative effects. Two 3 to 9 Jupiter\nmass planets were embedded in the disk and their dynamical evolution due to\ndisk-planet interaction was followed for over 100 000 years. The simulations\naccount for mass accretion onto the star and planets. We included models with\nparameters geared to the system PDS 70. To assess the observability of features\nin our models we performed synthetic ALMA observations.\n  For systems with a more massive inner planet there are phases where both\nplanets migrate outward engaged in a 2:1 mean motion resonance via the\nMasset-Snellgrove mechanism. In sufficiently massive disks the formation of a\nvortex in the outer disk can trigger rapid outward migration of the outer\nplanet where its distance increases by tens of au within a few thousand years.\nLater, the outer planet migrates back inwards settling again into resonance\nwith the inner planet. We call this emerging composite phenomenon a 'migration\njump'. Outward migration and the migration jumps are accompanied by a high mass\naccretion rate onto the star. The synthetic images reveal numerous\nsubstructures depending on the type of dynamical behaviour. Our results suggest\nthat the outward migration of two embedded planets is a prime candidate for the\nexplanation of the observed high stellar mass accretion rate in wide transition\ndisks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Sep 2020 13:20:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-11"}

Particularly 2D Sb/graphene interfaces are of prime importance as\ncontacts in electronics and electrodes in batteries.

Instead, the pairwise similarity can be estimated more\naccurately along the geodesic path of the underlying data manifold by exploring\nthe rich contextual information of the sample. In this paper, we propose a\nlightweight post-processing person re-identification method in which the\npairwise measure is determined by the relationship between the sample and the\ncounterpart's context in an unsupervised way. We translate the point-to-point\ncomparison into the bilateral point-to-set comparison.

However, automatic stem-leaf segmentation of maize\nshoots from three-dimensional (3D) point clouds remains challenging, especially\nfor new emerging leaves that are very close and wrapped together during the\nseedling stage. To address this issue, we propose an automatic segmentation\nmethod consisting of three main steps: skeleton extraction, coarse segmentation\nbased on the skeleton, fine segmentation based on stem-leaf classification. The\nsegmentation method was tested on 30 maize seedlings and compared with manually\nobtained ground truth. The mean precision, mean recall, mean micro F1 score and\nmean over accuracy of our segmentation algorithm were 0.964, 0.966, 0.963 and\n0.969. Using the segmentation results, two applications were also developed in\nthis paper, including phenotypic trait extraction and skeleton optimization.\nSix phenotypic parameters can be accurately and automatically measured,\nincluding plant height, crown diameter, stem height and diameter, leaf width\nand length. Furthermore, the values of R2 for the six phenotypic traits were\nall above 0.94. The results indicated that the proposed algorithm could\nautomatically and precisely segment not only the fully expanded leaves, but\nalso the new leaves wrapped together and close together. The proposed approach\nmay play an important role in further maize research and applications, such as\ngenotype-to-phenotype study, geometric reconstruction and dynamic growth\nanimation.

Cost effective methods of GDV identification will enable strategic\nprotection of these critical ecological systems, through improved and\nsustainable groundwater management by communities and industry. Recent\napplication of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) earth observation data in\nAustralia has demonstrated the utility of radar for identifying terrestrial\ngroundwater-dependent ecosystems at scale. We propose a robust classification\nmethod to advance identification of GDVs at scale using processed SAR data\nproducts adapted from a recent previous method.

The SARGDV model demonstrated high\nperformance for classifying GDVs with 77% precision, 76% true positive rate and\n96% accuracy. This method may be used to support the protection of GDV\ncommunities globally by providing a long term, cost-effective solution to\nidentify GDVs over variable regions and climates, via the use of freely\navailable, high-resolution, globally available Sentinel-1 SAR data sets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Sep 2020 14:35:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-08"}

To address this challenge, this paper proposes to integrate\nunmanned ground vehicle (UGV) with EL. With such a scheme, the UGV could\nimprove the communication quality by approaching various IoT devices. However,\ndifferent devices may transmit different data for different machine learning\njobs and a fundamental question is how to jointly plan the UGV path, the\ndevices' energy consumption, and the number of samples for different jobs? This\npaper further proposes a graph-based path planning model, a network energy\nconsumption model and a sample size planning model that characterizes F-measure\nas a function of the minority class sample size. With these models, the joint\npath, energy and sample size planning (JPESP) problem is formulated as a\nlarge-scale mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, which is\nnontrivial to solve due to the high-dimensional discontinuous variables related\nto UGV movement. To this end, it is proved that each IoT device should be\nserved only once along the path, thus the problem dimension is significantly\nreduced. Furthermore, to handle the discontinuous variables, a tabu search (TS)\nbased algorithm is derived, which converges in expectation to the optimal\nsolution to the JPESP problem. Simulation results under different task\nscenarios show that our optimization schemes outperform the fixed EL and the\nfull path EL schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Sep 2020 14:51:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-08"}

Due to the inherent approximation errors, the\nsolutions predicted by DNNs may violate the operating constraints, e.g., the\ntransmission line capacities, limiting their applicability in practice. To\naddress this challenge, we develop DeepOPF+ as a DNN approach based on the\nso-called \"preventive\" framework. Specifically, we calibrate the generation and\ntransmission line limits used in the DNN training, thereby anticipating\napproximation errors and ensuring that the resulting predicted solutions remain\nfeasible. We theoretically characterize the calibration magnitude necessary for\nensuring universal feasibility. Our DeepOPF+ approach improves over existing\nDNN-based schemes in that it ensures feasibility and achieves a consistent\nspeed up performance in both light-load and heavy-load regimes. Detailed\nsimulation results on a range of test instances show that the proposed DeepOPF+\ngenerates 100% feasible solutions with minor optimality loss.

When such an electron emits a\nphoton, it can do so either as if its charge were confined to a point within a\ncoherence length, the region where a square modulus of a wave function\n$|\\psi|^2$ is localized, or as a continuous cloud of space charge spread over\nit. This problem was addressed in a recent study R.~Remez, et al., Phys. Rev.\nLett. {\\bf 123}, 060401 (2019) where a conclusion was drawn in favor of the\nfirst (point) interpretation. Here we argue that there is an alternative\nexplanation for the measurements reported in that paper, which relies on purely\nclassical arguments and does not allow one to refute the second interpretation.\nWe propose an experiment of Smith-Purcell radiation from a non-relativistic\nvortex electron carrying orbital angular momentum, which can unambiguously lead\nto the opposite conclusion. Beyond the paraxial approximation, the vortex\npacket has a non-point electric quadrupole moment, which grows as the packet\nspreads and results in a non-linear $L^3$-growth of the radiation intensity\nwith the length $L$ of the grating when $L$ is much larger than the packet's\nRayleigh length. Such a non-linear effect has never been observed for single\nelectrons and, if detected, it would be a hallmark of the non-point nature of\ncharge in a wave packet. Thus, two views on $|\\psi|^2$ are complementary to\neach other and an electron radiates either as a point charge or as a continuous\ncharge flow depending on the experimental conditions and on its quantum state.\nOur conclusions hold for a large class of non-Gaussian packets and emission\nprocesses for which the radiation formation length can exceed the Rayleigh\nlength, such as Cherenkov radiation, transition radiation, diffraction\nradiation, and so forth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Sep 2020 15:36:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2020 05:46:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-09"}

First and foremost, this ability depends on\nperceptual discriminability; e.g., observers must be able to see the difference\nbetween different colors for those colors to communicate different meanings.\nHowever, the ability to interpret visualizations also depends on semantic\ndiscriminability, the degree to which observers can infer a unique mapping\nbetween visual features and concepts, based on the visual features and concepts\nalone (i.e., without help from verbal cues such as legends or labels). Previous\nevidence suggested that observers were better at interpreting encoding systems\nthat maximized semantic discriminability (maximizing association strength\nbetween assigned colors and concepts while minimizing association strength\nbetween unassigned colors and concepts), compared to a system that only\nmaximized color-concept association strength. However, increasing semantic\ndiscriminability also resulted in increased perceptual distance, so it is\nunclear which factor was responsible for improved performance. In the present\nstudy, we conducted two experiments that tested for independent effects of\nsemantic distance and perceptual distance on semantic discriminability of bar\ngraph data visualizations. Perceptual distance was large enough to ensure\ncolors were more than just noticeably different. We found that increasing\nsemantic distance improved performance, independent of variation in perceptual\ndistance, and when these two factors were uncorrelated, responses were\ndominated by semantic distance.

Contrarily, Taylor\ncoefficients of DNNs still appear mainly in the light of interpretability\nstudies, where they are computed at most to first order. However, especially in\ntheoretical physics numerous problems benefit from accessing higher orders, as\nwell. This gap motivates a general formulation of neural network (NN) Taylor\nexpansions. Restricting our analysis to multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and\nintroducing quantities we refer to as propagators and vertices, both depending\non the MLP's weights and biases, we establish a graph-theoretical approach.\nSimilarly to Feynman rules in quantum field theories, we can systematically\nassign diagrams containing propagators and vertices to the corresponding\npartial derivative. Examining this approach for S-wave scattering lengths of\nshallow potentials, we observe NNs to adapt their derivatives mainly to the\nleading order of the target function's Taylor expansion. To circumvent this\nproblem, we propose an iterative NN perturbation theory. During each iteration\nwe eliminate the leading order, such that the next-to-leading order can be\nfaithfully learned during the subsequent iteration.

This paper gives an overview of the components used in\nABC130 barrel modules, their assembly procedure and findings resulting from\ntheir tests.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Sep 2020 15:59:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-08"}

One of the most interesting features of this\napproach is the small computational effort required to solve the motion of the\nrigid body, comparable to a pure fluid solver. The model is based on the idea\nof extending the fluid velocity inside the rigid body and solving the flow\nequations with a penalization term to enforce rigid motion inside the solid. In\norder to get the velocity field in the fluid domain the Navier-Stokes equations\nfor an incompressible viscous flow are solved using a fractional-step procedure\ncombined with the two-step Taylor-Galerkin for the fractional linear momentum.\nOnce the velocity field in the fluid domain is computed, calculation of the\nrigid motion is obtained by averaging translation and angular velocities over\nthe solid. One of the main challenges when dealing with the fluid-solid\ninteraction is the proper modelling of the interface which separates the solid\nmoving mass from the viscous fluid. In this work the combination of the level\nset technique and the two-step Taylor-Galerkin algorithm for tracking the\nfluid-solid interface is proposed. The good properties exhibited by the\ntwo-step Taylor-Galerkin, minimizing oscillations and numerical diffusion, make\nthis method suitable to accurately advect the solid domain avoiding distortions\nat its boundaries, and thus preserving the initial size and shape of the rigid\nbody.

Focusing on\nconfiguration model networks, which exhibit a given degree distribution\n$P_0(k)$ and no correlations, we show using a rigorous argument that upon\ncontraction the degree distributions of these networks converge towards a\nPoisson distribution. To this end, we use the relative entropy $S_t=S[P_t(k) ||\n\\pi(k|\\langle K \\rangle_t)]$ of the degree distribution $P_t(k)$ of the\ncontracting network at time $t$ with respect to the corresponding Poisson\ndistribution $\\pi(k|\\langle K \\rangle_t)$ with the same mean degree $\\langle K\n\\rangle_t$ as a distance measure between $P_t(k)$ and Poisson.

This fine-tuned language model is able to generate lengthy\nparagraph conditioned on a given topic without diverging too much. The\nsimplicity of this model allows it to be applicable to a variety of underlying\nlanguage model architecture since it only modifies the final layer of the\npre-trained model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Sep 2020 06:10:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-15"}

However, the performance of these\napplications can widely vary depending on the runtime flags chosen out of all\nexisting JVM flags. Manually tuning these flags is both cumbersome and\nerror-prone. Automated tuning approaches can ease the task, but current\nsolutions either require considerable processing time or target a subset of\nflags to avoid time and space requirements. In this paper, we present\nOneStopTuner, a Machine Learning based novel framework for autotuning JVM\nflags. OneStopTuner controls the amount of data generation by leveraging batch\nmode active learning to characterize the user application. Based on the\nuser-selected optimization metric, OneStopTuner then discards the irrelevant\nJVM flags by applying feature selection algorithms on the generated data.\nFinally, it employs sample efficient methods such as Bayesian optimization and\nregression guided Bayesian optimization on the shortlisted JVM flags to find\nthe optimal values for the chosen set of flags. We evaluated OneStopTuner on\nwidely used Spark benchmarks and compare its performance with the traditional\nsimulated annealing based autotuning approach. We demonstrate that for\noptimizing execution time, the flags chosen by OneStopTuner provides a speedup\nof up to 1.35x over default Spark execution, as compared to 1.15x speedup by\nusing the flag configurations proposed by simulated annealing. OneStopTuner was\nable to reduce the number of executions for data-generation by 70% and was able\nto suggest the optimal flag configuration 2.4x faster than the standard\nsimulated annealing based approach, excluding the time for data-generation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Sep 2020 06:15:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-15"}

Since the beginning of this infection in India, the\ngovernment implemented several policies and restrictions to curtail its spread\namong the population. As the time passed, these restrictions were relaxed and\npeople were advised to follow precautionary measures by themselves. These\ntimely decisions taken by the Indian government helped in decelerating the\nspread of COVID-19 to a large extent. Despite these decisions, the pandemic\ncontinues to spread and hence, there is an urgent need to plan and control the\nspread of this disease. This is possible by finding the future predictions\nabout the spread. Scientists across the globe are working towards estimating\nthe future growth of COVID-19. This paper proposes a Modified SEIRD\n(Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered-Deceased) model for projecting COVID-19\ninfections in India and its five states having the highest number of total\ncases. In this model, exposed compartment contains individuals which may be\nasymptomatic but infectious. Deep Learning based Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)\nmodel has also been used in this paper to perform short-term projections. The\nprojections obtained from the proposed Modified SEIRD model have also been\ncompared with the projections made by LSTM for next 30 days. The\nepidemiological data up to 15th August 2020 has been used for carrying out\npredictions in this paper. These predictions will help in arranging adequate\nmedical infrastructure and providing proper preventive measures to handle the\ncurrent pandemic. The effect of different lockdowns imposed by the Indian\ngovernment has also been used in modelling and analysis in the proposed\nModified SEIRD model. The results presented in this paper will act as a beacon\nfor future policy-making to control the COVID-19 spread in India.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Sep 2020 07:38:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-15"}
