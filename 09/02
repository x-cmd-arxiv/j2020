The key to make well-performing ensemble model is in the\ndiversity of the base models. Of the most common solutions for introducing\ndiversity into the decision trees are bagging and random forest. Bagging\nenhances the diversity by sampling with replacement and generating many\ntraining data sets, while random forest adds selecting a random number of\nfeatures as well. This has made the random forest a winning candidate for many\nmachine learning applications.

The original\nsystem has a reduced density matrix $\\rho_\\mathrm{o}$ and the real space is\npartitioned via a projecting operator $\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathrm o}$. After\ndualization, we obtain a new reduced density matrix $\\rho_{\\mathrm{d}}$ and a\nnew real space projector $\\mathcal{R}_{\\mathrm d}$.

Recently it\nhas become clear that jets may be fundamental to the star formation process in\nremoving angular momentum from the surrounding protoplanetary disk thereby\nallowing accretion to proceed. Moreover, with the realisation that planetary\nformation begins much earlier than previously thought, jets may also help forge\nplanets by determining initial environmental characteristics. This seems to be\nparticularly true within the so-called terrestrial planet forming zone. Here we\nreview observations of jets from young stars which have greatly benefitted from\nnew facilities such as ALMA, space observatories like Spitzer, Herschel and\nHST, and radio facilities like LOFAR and the VLA. Interferometers such as CHARA\nand GRAVITY are starting to make inroads into resolving how they are launched,\nand we can look forward to a bright future in our understanding of this\nphenomenon when JWST and the SKA come on stream.

To overcome this\nlimitation, data augmentation and semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods have\nbeen developed. However, these methods have limited effectiveness as they\neither exploit the existing data set only (data augmentation) or risk negative\nimpact by adding poor training examples (SSL). Segmentations are rarely the\nfinal product of medical image analysis - they are typically used in downstream\ntasks to infer higher-order patterns to evaluate diseases. Clinicians take into\naccount a wealth of prior knowledge on biophysics and physiology when\nevaluating image analysis results. We have used these clinical assessments in\nprevious works to create robust quality-control (QC) classifiers for automated\ncardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel\nscheme that uses QC of the downstream task to identify high quality outputs of\nCMR segmentation networks, that are subsequently utilised for further network\ntraining. In essence, this provides quality-aware augmentation of training data\nin a variant of SSL for segmentation networks (semiQCSeg). We evaluate our\napproach in two CMR segmentation tasks (aortic and short axis cardiac volume\nsegmentation) using UK Biobank data and two commonly used network architectures\n(U-net and a Fully Convolutional Network) and compare against supervised and\nSSL strategies. We show that semiQCSeg improves training of the segmentation\nnetworks. It decreases the need for labelled data, while outperforming the\nother methods in terms of Dice and clinical metrics. SemiQCSeg can be an\nefficient approach for training segmentation networks for medical image data\nwhen labelled datasets are scarce.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2020 17:18:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-02"}

In spite of the outstanding sample quality achieved by those\nearly methods, they model the target distributions \\emph{implicitly}, in the\nsense that the probability density functions induced by them are not explicitly\naccessible. This fact renders those methods unfit for tasks that require, for\nexample, scoring new instances of data with the learned distributions.\nNormalizing flows have overcome this limitation by leveraging the\nchange-of-variables formula for probability density functions, and by using\ntransformations designed to have tractable and cheaply computable Jacobians.\nAlthough flexible, this framework lacked (until recently\n\\autocites{semisuplearning_nflows, RAD}) a way to introduce discrete structure\n(such as the one found in mixtures) in the models it allows to construct, in an\nunsupervised scenario. The present work overcomes this by using normalizing\nflows as components in a mixture model and devising an end-to-end training\nprocedure for such a model. This procedure is based on variational inference,\nand uses a variational posterior parameterized by a neural network. As will\nbecome clear, this model naturally lends itself to (multimodal) density\nestimation, semi-supervised learning, and clustering.

We then show\nexperimentally that the antiferromagnetic compound GdSb$_{0.46}$Te$_{1.48}$ is\na nearly ideal Dirac semimetal based on the proposed mechanism, meaning that\nmost interfering bands at the Fermi level are suppressed. Its highly unusual\ntransport behavior points to a thus far unknown regime, in which Dirac carriers\nwith Fermi energy very close to the node seem to gradually localize in the\npresence of lattice and magnetic disorder.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2020 18:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Jun 2021 18:27:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 22 Jun 2021 02:43:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-23"}

In this paper, we are concerned about the spin\ndynamics of the ferromagnetic model on the spherical surface. We use the\nSchwinger bosonic formalism for describing the thermodynamics of spin operators\nin terms of spinon operators. Opposite to the flat two-dimensional model, which\nis disordered at finite temperature, the curvature of the spherical surface\nprovides non-zero critical temperature for Schwinger boson condensation, which\ncharacterizes order at finite temperature even in the absence of external\nmagnetic fields. The thermodynamics is then analyzed in the low-temperature\nregime. In addition, we consider the presence of both static and oscillating\nmagnetic fields, the necessary condition for inducing the ferromagnetic\nresonance, and we show systematically that the studied model is well-described\nby $SU(2)$ coherent states, which provides the correct dynamics of the\nmagnetization.

An overlay that is specialized for an application, or a\nclass of applications, offers both fast reconfiguration and minimized\nperformance penalty. Such an overlay is usually implemented by hardware\ndesigners in hardware \"assembly\" languages at register-transfer level (RTL).\n  This short article proposes an idea for a software programmer, instead of\nhardware designers, to quickly implement an application-specific overlay using\nhigh-level customizable IPs. These IPs are expressed succinctly by a\nspecification language, whose abstraction level is much higher than RTL but can\nnonetheless expresses many performance-critical loop and data optimizations on\nFPGAs, and thus would offer competitively high performance at a much lower cost\nof maintenance and much easier customizations.\n  We propose new language features to easily put the IPs together into an\noverlay. A compiler automatically implements the specified optimizations to\ngenerate an efficient overlay, exposes a multi-tasking programming interface\nfor the overlay, and inserts a runtime scheduler for scheduling tasks to run on\nthe IPs of the overlay, respecting the dependences between the tasks. While an\napplication written in any language can take advantage of the overlay through\nthe programming interface, we show a particular usage scenario, where the\napplication itself is also succinctly specified in the same language.\n  We describe the new language features for expressing overlays, and illustrate\nthe features with an LU decomposer and a convolutional neural network.

In contrast, the [CII] 158 micron\nline is relatively bright, highlighting a potentially important reservoir of H2\nthat is not traced by CO(1-0), but residing in the C+ - emitting regions. We\nexplore a method to quantify the total H2 mass (MH2) in galaxies and learn what\nparameters control the CO-dark gas reservoir. We present Cloudy grids of\ndensity, radiation field and metallicity in terms of observed quantities, such\nas [OI], [CI], CO(1-0), [CII], total infrared luminosity and the total MH2 and\nprovide recipes based on these models to derive total MH2 mass estimates from\nobservations. The models are applied to the Herschel Dwarf Galaxy Survey,\nextracting the total MH2 for each galaxy which is compared to the H2 determined\nfrom the observed CO(1-0) line. While the H2 traced by CO(1-0) can be\nnegligible, the [CII] 158 micron line can trace the total H2. 70% to 100% of\nthe total H2 mass is not traced by CO(1-0) in the dwarf galaxies, but is\nwell-traced by [CII] 158 micron line. The CO-dark gas mass fraction correlates\nwith the observed L[CII]/LCO(1-0) ratio. A conversion factor for [CII]\nluminosity to total H2 and a new CO-to-total-MH2 conversion factor, as a\nfunction of metallicity, is presented. A recipe is provided to quantify the\ntotal mass of H2 in galaxies, taking into account the CO and [CII]\nobservations. Accounting for this CO-dark H2 gas, we find that the star forming\ndwarf galaxies now fall on the Schmidt-Kennicutt relation.

We introduce a physics-driven generative approach that\nconsists of two learnable neural modules: 1) a module that synthesizes 3D\ncardiac shapes along with their materials, and 2) a CT simulator that renders\nthese into realistic 3D CT Volumes, with annotations. Since the model of\ngeometry and material is disentangled from the imaging sensor, it can\neffectively be trained across multiple medical centers. We show that our data\nsynthesis framework improves the downstream segmentation performance on several\ndatasets.

A retrospective dataset involving\nabdominal computed tomography (CT) images acquired from 159 patients diagnosed\nwith gastric cancer is assembled. Among them, 121 cases have peritoneal\nmetastasis (PM), while 38 cases do not have PM.

Instead of\nlearning from a large dataset, we optimize the parameters of two cross-coupled\ndeep convolutional networks on a target image to generate two exclusive\nbackground and reflection layers. In particular, we design a new architecture\nof the network to embed semantic features extracted from a pre-trained deep\nclassification network, which gives more meaningful separation similar to human\nperception. Quantitative and qualitative results on commonly used datasets in\nthe literature show that our method's performance is at least on par with the\nstate-of-the-art supervised methods and, occasionally, better without requiring\nlarge training datasets. Our results also show that our method significantly\noutperforms the closest unsupervised method in the literature for removing\nreflections from single images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2020 21:08:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-03"}

Since ASR systems are vulnerable to audio replay attacks that can\nspoof and mislead ASR systems, a number of defense systems have been proposed\nto identify replayed audio signals based on the speakers' unique acoustic\nfeatures in the frequency domain. In this paper, we uncover a new type of\nreplay attack called modulated replay attack, which can bypass the existing\nfrequency domain based defense systems. The basic idea is to compensate for the\nfrequency distortion of a given electronic speaker using an inverse filter that\nis customized to the speaker's transform characteristics. Our experiments on\nreal smart devices confirm the modulated replay attacks can successfully escape\nthe existing detection mechanisms that rely on identifying suspicious features\nin the frequency domain. To defeat modulated replay attacks, we design and\nimplement a countermeasure named DualGuard. We discover and formally prove that\nno matter how the replay audio signals could be modulated, the replay attacks\nwill either leave ringing artifacts in the time domain or cause spectrum\ndistortion in the frequency domain. Therefore, by jointly checking suspicious\nfeatures in both frequency and time domains, DualGuard can successfully detect\nvarious replay attacks including the modulated replay attacks. We implement a\nprototype of DualGuard on a popular voice interactive platform, ReSpeaker Core\nv2. The experimental results show DualGuard can achieve 98% accuracy on\ndetecting modulated replay attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2020 21:25:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-05"}

In most cases, PVs are installed behind-the-meter (BTM),\nand only the net demand is recorded. Therefore, the native demand and PV\ngeneration are unknown to utilities. Separating native demand and solar\ngeneration from net demand is critical for improving grid-edge observability.\nIn this paper, a novel approach is proposed for disaggregating customer-level\nBTM PV generation using low-resolution but widely available hourly smart meter\ndata. The proposed approach exploits the strong correlation between monthly\nnocturnal and diurnal native demands and the high similarity among PV\ngeneration profiles. First, a joint probability density function (PDF) of\nmonthly nocturnal and diurnal native demands is constructed for customers\nwithout PVs, using Gaussian mixture modeling (GMM). Deviation from the\nconstructed PDF is utilized to probabilistically assess the monthly solar\ngeneration of customers with PVs. Then, to identify hourly BTM solar generation\nfor these customers, their estimated monthly solar generation is decomposed\ninto an hourly timescale; to do this, we have proposed a maximum likelihood\nestimation (MLE)-based technique that utilizes hourly typical solar exemplars.\nLeveraging the strong monthly native demand correlation and high PV generation\nsimilarity enhances our approach's robustness against the volatility of\ncustomers' hourly load and enables highly accurate disaggregation. The proposed\napproach has been verified using real native demand and PV generation data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2020 22:49:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 18 Apr 2021 19:13:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-30"}

In this paper, we constrain\nthe EEP by considering both Shapiro time delay and Faraday rotation effects. We\ncontinue to search for astronomical sources that are suitable for testing the\nEEP accuracy, and obtain 60 extragalactic radio sources with multi-wavelength\npolarization angles in three different radio bands (20, 8.6, and 4.8 GHz) and\n29 brightest stars within our own Milky Way galaxy with multi-colour linear\npolarimetric data in five optical bands ($UBVRI$).

We\nconsider an abstract molecular robotics model based on simple folding\ninstructions that execute asynchronously. Turning Machines are a simple 1D to\n2D folding model, also easily generalisable to 2D to 3D folding. A Turning\nMachine starts out as a line of connected monomers in the discrete plane, each\nwith an associated turning number. A monomer turns relative to its neighbours,\nexecuting a unit-distance translation that drags other monomers along with it,\nand through collective motion the initial set of monomers eventually folds into\na programmed shape. We provide a suite of tools for reasoning about Turning\nMachines by fully characterising their ability to execute line rotations:\nexecuting an almost-full line rotation of $5\\pi/3$ radians is possible, yet a\nfull $2\\pi$ rotation is impossible. Furthermore, line rotations up to $5\\pi/3$\nare executed efficiently, in $O(\\log n)$ expected time in our continuous time\nMarkov chain time model. We then show that such line-rotations represent a\nfundamental primitive in the model, by using them to efficiently and\nasynchronously fold shapes. In particular, arbitrarily large zig-zag-rastered\nsquares and zig-zag paths are foldable, as are $y$-monotone shapes albeit with\nerror (bounded by perimeter length). Finally, we give shapes that despite\nhaving paths that traverse all their points, are in fact impossible to fold, as\nwell as techniques for folding certain classes of (scaled) shapes without\nerror. Our approach relies on careful geometric-based analyses of the feats\npossible and impossible by a very simple robotic system, and pushes\nconceptional hardness towards mathematical analysis and away from molecular\nimplementation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2020 00:08:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 26 Dec 2021 22:46:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 24 Jan 2022 23:41:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-26"}

Existing\nalgorithms are mostly based on the objectives of matching and propagation\nstrategies, which often make use of the previous frame with masking or optical\nflow. This paper explores a new propagation method, uses short-term matching\nmodules to extract the information of the previous frame and apply it in\npropagation, and proposes the network of Long-Short-Term similarity matching\nfor video object segmentation (LSMOVS) Method: By conducting pixel-level\nmatching and correlation between long-term matching module and short-term\nmatching module with the first frame and previous frame, global similarity map\nand local similarity map are obtained, as well as feature pattern of current\nframe and masking of previous frame. After two refine networks, final results\nare obtained through segmentation network.

Besides, the count of segmented frames per second reached\n21.

By combining the long-term matching module with the short-term matching\nmodule, the whole network can achieve efficient video object segmentation\nwithout online fine tuning\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2020 01:32:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-03"}

CLOCs\noperates on the combined output candidates before Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS)\nof any 2D and any 3D detector, and is trained to leverage their geometric and\nsemantic consistencies to produce more accurate final 3D and 2D detection\nresults. Our experimental evaluation on the challenging KITTI object detection\nbenchmark, including 3D and bird's eye view metrics, shows significant\nimprovements, especially at long distance, over the state-of-the-art fusion\nbased methods. At time of submission, CLOCs ranks the highest among all the\nfusion-based methods in the official KITTI leaderboard. We will release our\ncode upon acceptance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2020 02:07:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-03"}

Meanwhile, the recently reported\nlayered superconductor, Sc$_{20}$C$_{8-x}$B$_x$C$_{20}$, requires a small\namount of boron, which is a light element, for its structural stability. In\nthis context, here, we quantitatively evaluate the optimal $x$ value using both\nthe experimental and computational approaches. Using the high-pressure\nsynthesis approach that can maintain the starting composition even after\nsintering, we obtain the Sc$_{20}$(C,B)$_{8}$C$_{20}$ phase by the reaction of\nthe previously reported Sc$_{15}$C$_{19}$ and B (Sc$_{15}$B$_y$C$_{19}$).

We introduce a general framework for solving such\nproblems in a fully-dynamic setting where the function $f$ changes over time,\nand only a bounded number of updates to the solution (recourse) is allowed.

In both cases, the temperature dependence of the switching voltage implies\nthat the conductivity change is due to the insulator-metal transition in VO2.\nFrom this analysis it is concluded that electroforming at low currents creates\na conductive filament comprised largely of polycrystalline VO2, while\nelectroforming at high currents creates a composite structure comprised of VO2\nand a conductive halo of oxygen deficient VOx. The effect of electroforming on\nthe NDR mode is then explained with reference to a lumped element model of\nfilamentary conduction that includes the effect of a parallel resistance\ncreated by the halo.

In this paper, we show that open-set\nrecognition systems are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Furthermore, we show\nthat adversarial defense mechanisms trained on known classes do not generalize\nwell to open-set samples. Motivated by this observation, we emphasize the need\nof an Open-Set Adversarial Defense (OSAD) mechanism. This paper proposes an\nOpen-Set Defense Network (OSDN) as a solution to the OSAD problem.

Second, PANE includes a\nhighly efficient solver for the above optimization problem, whose key module is\na carefully designed initialization of the embeddings, which drastically\nreduces the number of iterations required to converge. Finally, PANE utilizes\nmulti-core CPUs through non-trivial parallelization of the above solver, which\nachieves scalability while retaining the high quality of the resulting\nembeddings. The performance of PANE depends upon the number of attributes in\nthe input network. To handle large networks with numerous attributes, we\nfurther extend PANE to PANE++. Extensive experiments, comparing 10 existing\napproaches on 8 real datasets, demonstrate that PANE and PANE++ consistently\noutperform all existing methods in terms of result quality, while being orders\nof magnitude faster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2020 05:15:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Mar 2023 08:49:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-31"}

In contrast, the reciprocal of the binomial proportion, also\nknown as the inverse proportion, is often overlooked, even though it also plays\nan important role in various fields including clinical studies and random\nsampling. The maximum likelihood estimator of the inverse proportion suffers\nfrom the zero-event problem, and to overcome it, alternative methods have been\ndeveloped in the literature. Nevertheless, there is little work addressing the\noptimality of the existing estimators, as well as their practical performance\ncomparison. Inspired by this, we propose to further advance the literature by\ndeveloping an optimal estimator for the inverse proportion in a family of\nshrinkage estimators. We further derive the explicit and approximate formulas\nfor the optimal shrinkage parameter under different settings. Simulation\nstudies show that the performance of our new estimator performs better than, or\nas well as, the existing competitors in most practical settings. Finally, to\nillustrate the usefulness of our new method, we also revisit a recent\nmeta-analysis on COVID-19 data for assessing the relative risks of physical\ndistancing on the infection of coronavirus, in which six out of seven studies\nencounter the zero-event problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2020 05:17:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Aug 2021 07:23:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-31"}

Measurement\nof a non-zero permanent electric dipole moment (EDM) for fundamental particles,\nsuch as in an electron or a neutron, or in nuclei or atoms, can help us gain a\nhandle on the sources of CP violation, both in SM and beyond. Multiple\nmechanisms within the SM can generate CP violating EDMs, viz.\\ through the CKM\nmatrix in the weak sector or through the QCD $\\bar{\\theta}$ parameter in the\nstrong sector. We will estimate the maximum possible EDMs of leptons, certain\nbaryons, select atoms and molecules in the (CKM$\\bigoplus\\bar{\\theta}$)\nframework, assuming that the EDM wholly originates from either of the two SM\nmechanisms, independently.

A first of its kind for these\nrevolutionary cameras, the tracking framework uses a discriminative\nrepresentation for the object with online learning, and detects and re-tracks\nthe object when it comes back into the field-of-view. One of the key novelties\nis the use of an event-based local sliding window technique that tracks\nreliably in scenes with cluttered and textured background. In addition,\nBayesian bootstrapping is used to assist real-time processing and boost the\ndiscriminative power of the object representation. On the other hand, when the\nobject re-enters the field-of-view of the camera, a data-driven, global sliding\nwindow detector locates the object for subsequent tracking. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate the ability of the proposed framework to track and\ndetect arbitrary objects of various shapes and sizes, including dynamic objects\nsuch as a human. This is a significant improvement compared to earlier works\nthat simply track objects as long as they are visible under simpler background\nsettings. Using the ground truth locations for five different objects under\nthree motion settings, namely translation, rotation and 6-DOF, quantitative\nmeasurement is reported for the event-based tracking framework with critical\ninsights on various performance issues.

It was\nlaunched on 10 February 2020 04:03 UTC from Cape Canaveral and aims to address\nkey questions of solar and heliospheric physics pertaining to how the Sun\ncreates and controls the Heliosphere, and why solar activity changes with time.\nTo answer these, the mission carries six remote-sensing instruments to observe\nthe Sun and the solar corona, and four in-situ instruments to measure the solar\nwind, energetic particles, and electromagnetic fields. In this paper, we\ndescribe the science objectives of the mission, and how these will be addressed\nby the joint observations of the instruments onboard. The paper first\nsummarises the mission-level science objectives, followed by an overview of the\nspacecraft and payload. We report the observables and performance figures of\neach instrument, as well as the trajectory design. This is followed by a\nsummary of the science operations concept. The paper concludes with a more\ndetailed description of the science objectives. Solar Orbiter will combine\nin-situ measurements in the heliosphere with high-resolution remote-sensing\nobservations of the Sun to address fundamental questions of solar and\nheliospheric physics. The performance of the Solar Orbiter payload meets the\nrequirements derived from the mission's science objectives. Its science return\nwill be augmented further by coordinated observations with other space missions\nand ground-based observatories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2020 07:20:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-30"}

The efficiency in this problem implies how a team of robots (agents)\ncovers a given domain, reflecting a priority of areas of interest represented\nby a density distribution, rather than simply following a preset of uniform\npatterns. To achieve an efficient multi-robot exploration, the optimal\ntransport theory that quantifies a distance between two density distributions\nis employed as a tool, which also serves as a means of performance measure. The\nenergy constraints for the multi-robot system is then incorporated into the\nOT-based multi-robot exploration scheme.\n  The proposed scheme is decoupled from robot dynamics, broadening the\napplicability of the multi-robot exploration plan to heterogeneous robot\nplatforms. Not only the centralized but also decentralized algorithms are\nprovided to cope with more realistic scenarios such as communication range\nlimits between agents. To measure the exploration efficiency, the upper bound\nof the performance is developed for both the centralized and decentralized\ncases based on the optimal transport theory, which is computationally tractable\nas well as efficient. The proposed multi-robot exploration scheme is also\napplicable to a time-varying distribution, where the spatio-temporal evolution\nof the given reference distribution is desired.

Since the market standard is the\npredetermined constant loss rate (60%) for all firms, it is hard to estimate\nloss-given-default distribution by just observing the market information such\nas default time distribution, default probability, and CDS spreads. To overcome\nthis difficulty, we construct a hybrid model with the last passage time of the\nleverage ratio (defined as the ratio of a firm's assets over its debt) to a\ncertain level. The last passage time, which is not a stopping time, allows us\nto appropriately model the timing of severe firm-value deterioration which is\nnot apparent to credit market participants. Under minimal and standard\nassumptions, our model captures asset value dynamics when close to default,\nwhile treating default as an unexpected event. We explicitly obtain the\ndistribution of the leverage ratio at default time. As we base the model solely\non the leverage ratio and do not introduce additional risk factors, both the\nmodel and the procedure for calibrating model parameters to the credit market\nare simple.

We focus on stars\nin the metallicity range -0.5<[Fe/H]<+0.3, an interval poorly explored for Rb\nabundances in previous analyses. To do this we use high-resolution,\nhigh-signal-to-noise-ratio, optical and near-infrared spectra of 57 M dwarfs\nobserved with CARMENES. The resulting [Sr/Fe] and [Zr/Fe] ratios for most M\ndwarfs are almost constant at about the solar value, and are identical to those\nfound in GK dwarfs of the same metallicity. However, for Rb we find systematic\nunderabundances ([Rb/Fe]<0.0) by a factor two on average. Furthermore, a\ntendency is found for Rb-but not for other heavy elements (Sr, Zr) -to increase\nwith increasing metallicity such that [Rb/Fe]>0.0 is attained at metallicities\nhigher than solar. These are surprising results, never seen for any other heavy\nelement, and are difficult to understand within the formulation of the s- and\nr-processes, both contributing sources to the Galactic Rb abundance.

On the other\nhand, it likely will serve as backbone infrastructure and could therefore be an\nattractive target for eavesdropping attacks. Compared with regular RF spectrum,\nwireless channels in the THz range could be less vulnerable to interceptions\nbecause of their high beam directionality and small signal coverage. However, a\nrisk for eavesdropping can still exist due to the multipath effects caused by\nunintended scattering. In this work, an eavesdropping risk for THz channel\npassing atmospheric turbulences and producing compromising emissions is\ninvestigated from a physical layer perspective. A model combining signal\nattenuation due to turbulence, gaseous absorption and beam divergence, is\ndeveloped for prediction of deterministic and probabilistic signal leakages.\nThe secrecy capacity and outage probability of the THz channel are derived and\nanalyzed with respect to variations of the turbulence strength and other\nchannels characteristics. The dependence of the channel performance on the\neavesdropper's position is investigated with respect to the maximum safe data\ntransmission rate (MSR) and the signal leakage region.

In the\npresent paper, the mobility of bidisperse segregated particle beds was studied\nwith a coupled fluid discrete element method. Large particles were initially\nplaced above small ones and it was observed that, for the same flow conditions,\nthe bedload transport rate is higher in the bidisperse configuration than in\nthe monodisperse one. Depending on the Shields number and on the depth of the\ninterface between small and large particles, different transport\nphenomenologies are observed, ranging from no influence of the small particles\nto small particles reaching the bed surface due to diffusive remixing. In cases\nwhere the small particles hardly mix with the overlying large particles and for\nthe range of studied size ratios ($r<4$), it is shown that the increased\nmobility is not a bottom roughness effect, that would be due to the reduction\nof roughness of the underlying small particles, but a granular flow effect.\nThis effect is analyzed within the framework of the $\\mu(I)$ rheology and it is\ndemonstrated that the buried small particles are more mobile than larger\nparticles and play the role of a \"conveyor belt\" for the large particles at the\nsurface. Based on rheological arguments, a simple predictive model is proposed\nfor the additional transport in the bidisperse case.

Understanding such natural hazards and their drivers is essential\nto mitigate related risks. Here, EPEs over the Mediterranean between 1979 and\n2019 are analyzed, using ERA5 dataset from ECMWF. EPEs are determined based on\nthe 99th percentile of the daily distribution (P99). The different EPE\ncharacteristics are assessed, based on seasonality and spatiotemporal\ndependencies. To better understand the connection to large-scale atmospheric\nflow patterns, Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis and subsequent\nK-means clustering are used to quantify the importance of weather regimes to\nEPE frequency. The analysis is performed for three different variables,\ndepicting atmospheric variability in the lower and middle troposphere: Sea\nlevel pressure (SLP), temperature at 850 hPa (T850), and geopotential height at\n500 hPa (Z500). Results show a clear spatial division in EPEs occurrence, with\nwinter (autumn) being the season of highest EPEs frequency for the eastern\n(western) Mediterranean. There is a high degree of temporal dependencies with\n20% of the EPEs (median value of all studied grid-cells), occurring up to 1\nweek after a preceding P99 event at the same location. Local orography is a key\nmodulator of the spatiotemporal connections and substantially enhances the\nprobability of co-occurrence of EPEs even for distant locations. The clustering\nclearly demonstrates the prevalence of distinct synoptic-scale atmospheric\nconditions during the occurrence of EPEs for different locations within the\nregion. Results indicate that clustering based on a combination of SLP and Z500\ncan increase the conditional probability of EPEs by more than three (3) times\n(median value for all grid cells) from the nominal probability of 1% for the\nP99 EPEs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2020 09:30:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-16"}

Here, we show that optical\nparametric oscillators (OPOs) can undergo second-order phase transitions in the\nspectral domain between degenerate and non-degenerate regimes. This abrupt\nchange in the spectral response follows a square-root dependence around the\ncritical point, exhibiting high sensitivity to parameter variation akin to\nsystems around an exceptional point. We experimentally demonstrate such a phase\ntransition in a quadratic OPO, map its dynamics to the universal\nSwift-Hohenberg equation, and extend it to Kerr OPOs. To emphasize the\nfundamental importance and consequences of this phase transition, we show that\nthe divergent susceptibility of the critical point is accompanied by\nspontaneous symmetry breaking and distinct phase noise properties in the two\nregimes, indicating the importance of a beyond nonlinear bifurcation\ninterpretation. We also predict the occurrence of first-order spectral phase\ntransitions in coupled OPOs.

In\nthis work, we compute torques acting onto the stellar surface of CTTs arising\nfrom different accreting (accretion funnels) and ejecting (stellar winds and\nmagnetospheric ejections) flow components. Furthermore, we compare the magnetic\nbraking due to stellar winds in two different systems: isolated and accreting\nstars. 2.5D magnetohydrodynamic, time-dependent, axisymmetric simulations are\nemployed. For both systems the stellar wind is thermally driven. In the\nstar-disk-interaction (SDI) simulations the accretion disk is Keplerian,\nviscous, and resistive. Two series of simulations are presented, one for each\nsystem. We find that in classical T Tauri systems the presence of\nmagnetospheric ejections confines the stellar-wind expansion, resulting in an\nhourglass-shaped geometry of the outflow. In addition, the formation of the\naccretion columns modifies the amount of open magnetic flux exploited by the\nstellar wind. These effects have a strong impact on the stellar wind properties\nand we show that the stellar-wind braking is more efficient in the\nstar-disk-interacting systems than in the isolated ones. We also derive torque\nscalings, over a wide range of magnetic field strengths, for each flow\ncomponent in a SDI system that directly applies a torque on the stellar\nsurface. In all the performed SDI simulations the stellar wind extracts less\nthan 2% of the mass accretion rate and the disk is truncated up to 66% of the\ncorotation radius. All the simulations show a net spin-up torque. In order to\nachieve a stellar-spin equilibrium we need either more massive stellar winds or\ndisks being truncated closer to the corotation radius, which increases the\ntorque efficiency by the magnetospheric ejections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2020 10:42:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-18"}

The\nlargest boulder is a 400 m-sized block on the Marcia crater floor. Relatively\nfew boulders reside in a large area of relatively low albedo, surmised to be\nthe carbon-rich ejecta of the Veneneia basin, either because boulders form less\neasily here or live shorter. By comparing the density of boulders around\ncraters with a known age, we find that the maximum boulder lifetime is about\n300 Ma.

In the black-box setting, current model\nstealing attacks train a substitute model to counterfeit the functionality of\nthe target model. However, the training requires querying the target model.\nConsequently, the query complexity remains high, and such attacks can be\ndefended easily. This study aims to train a generalized substitute model called\n\"Simulator\", which can mimic the functionality of any unknown target model. To\nthis end, we build the training data with the form of multiple tasks by\ncollecting query sequences generated during the attacks of various existing\nnetworks. The learning process uses a mean square error-based\nknowledge-distillation loss in the meta-learning to minimize the difference\nbetween the Simulator and the sampled networks. The meta-gradients of this loss\nare then computed and accumulated from multiple tasks to update the Simulator\nand subsequently improve generalization. When attacking a target model that is\nunseen in training, the trained Simulator can accurately simulate its\nfunctionality using its limited feedback. As a result, a large fraction of\nqueries can be transferred to the Simulator, thereby reducing query complexity.\nResults of the comprehensive experiments conducted using the CIFAR-10,\nCIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach\nreduces query complexity by several orders of magnitude compared to the\nbaseline method.

We propose\nmodifications to the traditional `hypermutations with mutation potential' (HMP)\nthat allow them to be efficient at exploitation as well as maintaining their\neffective explorative characteristics. Rather than deterministically evaluating\nfitness after each bit-flip of a hypermutation, we sample the fitness function\nstochastically with a `parabolic' distribution which allows the `stop at first\nconstructive mutation' (FCM) variant of HMP to reduce the linear amount of\nwasted function evaluations when no improvement is found to a constant. The\nstochastic distribution also allows the removal of the FCM mechanism altogether\nas originally desired in the design of the HMP operators. We rigorously prove\nthe effectiveness of the proposed operators for all the benchmark functions\nwhere the performance of HMP is rigorously understood in the literature and\nvalidating the gained insights to show linear speed-ups for the identification\nof high quality approximate solutions to classical NP-Hard problems from\ncombinatorial optimisation.

Through a comparative performance study of other `fast mutation'\noperators from the literature, we conclude that a power-law distribution for\nthe parabolic evaluation scheme is the best compromise in black box scenarios\nwhere little problem knowledge is available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2020 16:22:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-03"}

Indeed, comprehensions are tightly integrated\nwith general purpose programming languages and close enough to common query\nlanguages, such as SQL, to guarantee their translation into effective queries.\nComprehensions also support features for writing reusable and composable\nqueries, such as the handling of nested data and the use of functional\nabstractions. In parallel to these developments, optics have emerged in recent\nyears as the technology of choice to write programs that manipulate complex\ndata structures with nested components. Optic abstractions are easily\ncomposable and, in principle, permit both data access and updates. This paper\nattempts to exploit the notion of optic for LINQ as a higher-level language\nthat complements comprehension-based approaches. In order to do this, we lift a\nrestricted subset of optics, namely getters, affine folds and folds, into a\nfull-blown DSL. The type system of the resulting language of optics, that we\nhave named Optica, distills their compositional properties, whereas its\ndenotational semantics is given by standard optics. This formal specification\nof the concept of optic enables the definition of non-standard optic\nrepresentations beyond van Laarhoven, profunctor optics, etc. In particular,\nthe paper demonstrates that a restricted subset of XQuery can be understood as\nan optic representation; it introduces Triplets, a non-standard semantic domain\nto normalize optic expressions and facilitate the generation of SQL queries;\nand it describes how to generate comprehension-based queries from optic\nexpressions, thus showing that both approaches can coexist.The paper also\ndescribes S-Optica, a Scala implementation of Optica using the tagless-final\napproach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2020 12:19:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-03"}

This paper proposes a nonlinear blind scatterer separation method\nto retrieve the phase centers of the layovered scatterers, avoiding the\ncomputationally expensive tomographic inversion. We demonstrate that\nconventional linear separation methods, e.g., principle component analysis\n(PCA), can only partially separate the scatterers under good conditions.

The\nproposed method artificially increases the dimensionality of the data using\nkernel PCA, hence mitigating the aforementioned limitations. In the processing,\nthe proposed method sequentially deflates the covariance matrix using the\nestimate of the brightest scatterer from kernel PCA.

Here we suggest a method that is based on optimized data-dependent\ntriangulations of the network of gauge stations. Data-dependent triangulations\nare triangulations of point sets that rely not only on 2D point positions but\nalso on additional data (e.g. elevation, anomalies). In this article, we show\nhow data-dependent triangulations with min-error criteria can be used to\nreconstruct 2D maps of the sea surface anomaly over a longer time period,\nassuming that height anomalies are continuously monitored at a sparse set of\nstations and, in addition, observations of a reference surface is provided over\na shorter time period.

In this work, we thoroughly evaluate the privacy\nleakage of Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT), which is one of the most\nwidely-used image local features. We first consider the case that the adversary\ncan fully access the SIFT features, i.e., both the SIFT descriptors and the\ncoordinates are available. We propose a novel end-to-end, coarse-to-fine deep\ngenerative model for reconstructing the latent image from its SIFT features.\nThe designed deep generative model consists of two networks, where the first\none attempts to learn the structural information of the latent image by\ntransforming from SIFT features to Local Binary Pattern (LBP) features, while\nthe second one aims to reconstruct the pixel values guided by the learned LBP.\nCompared with the state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed deep generative\nmodel produces much improved reconstructed results over three public datasets.\nFurthermore, we address more challenging cases that only partial SIFT features\n(either SIFT descriptors or coordinates) are accessible to the adversary. It is\nshown that, if the adversary can only have access to the SIFT descriptors while\nnot their coordinates, then the modest success of reconstructing the latent\nimage can be achieved for highly-structured images (e.g., faces) and would fail\nin general settings.

However, most of existing CNNs based methods do\nnot take full advantage of spatial-temporal context modeling. In fact, the\nglobal spatial-temporal context can greatly clarify local distractions to\nenhance the target feature representation. To comprehensively leverage the\nspatial-temporal context information, in this work, we present a novel block,\nInteraction-Aggregation-Update (IAU), for high-performance person reID.\nFirstly, Spatial-Temporal IAU (STIAU) module is introduced. STIAU jointly\nincorporates two types of contextual interactions into a CNN framework for\ntarget feature learning. Here the spatial interactions learn to compute the\ncontextual dependencies between different body parts of a single frame. While\nthe temporal interactions are used to capture the contextual dependencies\nbetween the same body parts across all frames. Furthermore, a Channel IAU\n(CIAU) module is designed to model the semantic contextual interactions between\nchannel features to enhance the feature representation, especially for\nsmall-scale visual cues and body parts. Therefore, the IAU block enables the\nfeature to incorporate the globally spatial, temporal, and channel context. It\nis lightweight, end-to-end trainable, and can be easily plugged into existing\nCNNs to form IAUnet. The experiments show that IAUnet performs favorably\nagainst state-of-the-art on both image and video reID tasks and achieves\ncompelling results on a general object categorization task.

One key\nreason of the performance improvements made by existing methods lie in massive\npaired video-sentence data, but collecting such strong annotation, i.e.,\nhigh-quality sentences, is time-consuming and laborious. It is the fact that\nthere now exist an amazing number of videos with weak annotation that only\ncontains semantic concepts such as actions and objects. In this paper, we\ninvestigate using weak annotation instead of strong annotation to train a video\ncaptioning model. To this end, we propose a progressive visual reasoning method\nthat progressively generates fine sentences from weak annotations by inferring\nmore semantic concepts and their dependency relationships for video captioning.\nTo model concept relationships, we use dependency trees that are spanned by\nexploiting external knowledge from large sentence corpora. Through traversing\nthe dependency trees, the sentences are generated to train the captioning\nmodel. Accordingly, we develop an iterative refinement algorithm that refines\nsentences via spanning dependency trees and fine-tunes the captioning model\nusing the refined sentences in an alternative training manner. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that our method using weak annotation is very competitive\nto the state-of-the-art methods using strong annotation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2020 13:45:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-03"}

Stellar migration of the galactic disc stars has been invoked to\nexplain the dispersion of stellar metallicity observed in the solar\nneighborhood. Aims. We seek to identify the dynamical mechanisms underlying\nstellar migration in an isolated galaxy disc under the influence of a bar. Our\napproach is to analyze the diffusion of dynamical quantities. Methods. We\nextend our previous work by exploring Chirikov's diffusion rate (and derived\ntimescale) of the radial action $J_\\mathrm{R}$ in an idealised N$-$body\nsimulation of an isolated disc galaxy. We limit our study to the evolution of\nthe disc region well after the formation of the bar, in a regime of adiabatic\nevolution. Results. The $J_\\mathrm{R}$ diffusion timescales\n$T_\\mathrm{D}(J_\\mathrm{R})$ is less than 3 Gyr for roughly half the galaxy\nmass. It is always much shorter than the angular momentum diffusion timescale\n$T_\\mathrm{D}(L_\\mathrm{z})$ outside the stellar bar. In the disc, $\\langle\nT_\\mathrm{D}(J_\\mathrm{R}) \\rangle \\sim 1$ Gyr. All non-axisymmetric\nmorphological structures characteristic of resonances and waves in the disc are\nassociated to particles with $T_\\mathrm{D}(J_\\mathrm{R}) < 3$ Gyr and\n$T_\\mathrm{D}(L_\\mathrm{z}) > 10$ Gyr. Short $T_\\mathrm{D}(J_\\mathrm{R})$ can\nbe explained by the gradual decircularisation of initially circular orbits\n($J_\\mathrm{R}=0$) under the effect of intermittent ILR scattering by wave\ntrains propagating in the disc, well beyond the bar OLR. This leads to a\nmoderate secular heating of the disc beyond the bar OLR for 7 Gyr, comparable\nto solar neighbourhood observations. The complex multi-wave structure, mixing\npermanent and intermittent modes, allows for multiple resonance overlaps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2020 13:53:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-28"}

The main results are: 1) the mass loss of\nfirst generation stars is tightly correlated to cluster metallicity. 2) the\nlocation of helium enriched stars on the HB is reproduced only by adopting a\nhigher RGB mass loss than for the first generation. The difference in mass loss\ncorrelates with helium enhancement and cluster mass. 3) A model of \"pre-main\nsequence disc early loss\", previously developed by the authors, explains such a\nmass loss increase and is consistent with the findings of multiple-population\nformation models predicting that populations more enhanced in helium tend to\nform with higher stellar densities and concentrations. 4) Helium-enhancement\nand mass-loss both contribute to the second parameter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2020 13:53:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-09"}

This induced load causes an additional stress field on the\nslab which eventually triggers an avalanche. I present the results of 3D finite\nelement simulations in an elastoplastic domain. The plastic deformation of the\nweak-layer follows the Mohr-Coulomb-Cap model which provides a more realistic\nmodel as a pure elastic approach. I investigate how the stress field on top of\nthe weak-layer changes if one is skiing down-slope or parallel to the slope. A\nlayered snow slab changes the stress on top of the weak-layer and to\ninvestigate these changes I simulated two different representative layered\nslabs. One containing only soft layers to investigate how the weak layer is\naffected by the ski induced stress and the other hard-soft-hard layer to\nexamine bridge effects caused by the hard layers. A hard layer in the snow slab\nforms a sort of bridge which spreads the induced stress over a larger lateral\ndistance, at the same time decreasing the stress to the layers below the\nbridge.

This data flood\nprovides tremendous potential for discovering new and useful knowledge. But in\naddition to the fact that measurements are imprecise, spatial data is often\ninterpolated between discrete observations. To reduce communication and\nbandwidth utilization, data is often subjected to a reduction, thereby\neliminating some of the known/recorded values. These issues introduce the\nnotion of uncertainty in spatial data management, an aspect raising the\nimminent need for scalable and flexible solutions. The main scope of this\nchapter is to survey existing techniques for managing, querying, and mining\nuncertain spatial data. First, this chapter surveys common data representations\nfor uncertain data, explains the commonly used possible worlds semantics to\ninterpret an uncertain database, and surveys existing system to process\nuncertain data. Then, this chapter defines the notion of probabilistic result\nsemantics to distinguish the task of computing individual object probabilities\nversus computing entire result probabilities. This is important, as, for many\nqueries, the problem of computing object-level probabilities can be solved\nefficiently, whereas result-level probabilities are hard to compute. Finally,\nthis chapter introduces a novel paradigm to efficiently answer any kind of\nquery on uncertain data: the Paradigm of Equivalent Worlds, which groups the\nexponential set of possible database worlds into a polynomial number of sets of\nequivalent worlds that can be processed efficiently. Examples and use-cases of\nquerying uncertain spatial data are provided using the example of uncertain\nrange queries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2020 14:57:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-03"}

In the gauge theory side one can deform a given conformal\nfield theory by a proper scalar operator and compute the quantum information\nmetric via the two-point correlation function between two such operators. On\nthe string side the deformation corresponds to a scalar field probing the\nbackground. In the large $N$ limit of the theory the probing can be done\nwithout backreaction on the original spacetime, thus one can construct a\nperturbative scheme for the calculation of the dual holographic Fisher\ninformation metric as shown by \\cite{Trivella:2016brw}.

In the first part of the thesis, we propose a new off-shell\nformulation for a massless integer superspin multiplet, whose gauge-invariant\naction involves an unconstrained complex superconformal prepotential, in\nconjunction with two types of compensators. Next, we deduce the structure of\nconsistent non-conformal higher-spin ${\\cal N}=1$ supercurrents.

Two dually equivalent off-shell Lagrangian\nformulations for the massless multiplets of arbitrary superspin in (1,1) AdS\nsuperspace and their corresponding supercurrents are derived.

Furthermore,\nthe kinetic model allows to clarify how a selective control can be assumed to\nachieve a minimal lockdown strategy by only reducing individuals undergoing a\nvery large number of daily contacts. We conduct numerical simulations which\nconfirm the ability of the model to describe different phenomena characteristic\nof the rapid spread of an epidemic. Motivated by the COVID-19 pandemic, a last\npart is dedicated to fit numerical solutions of the proposed model with\ninfection data coming from different European countries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2020 15:35:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Apr 2021 10:44:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-02"}

In this paper, we study an emerging class of such\nincomplete algorithms that are broadly termed as population-based algorithms.\nThe main characteristic of these algorithms is that they maintain a population\nof candidate solutions of a given problem and use this population to cover a\nlarge area of the search space and to avoid local-optima.

To this end, we propose to maximally exploit potential multicast\nopportunities by effectively utilizing characteristics of multi-quality tiled\n360 VR videos and computation resources at the users' side. In particular, we\nconsider two requirements for quality variation in one field-of-view (FoV),\ni.e., the absolute smoothness requirement and the relative smoothness\nrequirement, and two video playback modes, i.e., the direct-playback mode\n(without user transcoding) and transcode-playback mode (with user transcoding).\nBesides natural multicast opportunities, we introduce two new types of\nmulticast opportunities, namely, relative smoothness-enabled multicast\nopportunities, which allow flexible tradeoff between viewing quality and\ncommunications resource consumption, and transcoding-enabled multicast\nopportunities, which allow flexible tradeoff between computation and\ncommunications resource consumptions. Then, we establish a novel mathematical\nmodel that reflects the impacts of natural, relative smoothness-enabled and\ntranscoding-enabled multicast opportunities on the average transmission energy\nand transcoding energy. Based on this model, we optimize the transmission\nresource allocation, playback quality level selection and transmission quality\nlevel selection to minimize the energy consumption in the four cases with\ndifferent requirements for quality variation and video playback modes. By\ncomparing the optimal values in the four cases, we prove that the energy\nconsumption reduces when more multicast opportunities can be utilized.

Each of these algorithms occupies a different spot in the\ntrade-off between computational complexity and accuracy. A novel heuristic\nalgorithm is proposed in this paper to improve upon existing methods.

While the\ngreedy minimization makes the algorithm sensitive to initialisation, the\nability to converge from any initial guess to a local optimum allows the\nalgorithm to be integrated into other existing algorithms. Three variants of\nthe algorithm are tested over a large number of synthetic datasets, one being a\nstandalone LM implementation, and two others that combine with existing\nalgorithms. One of the latter two -- LM-enhanced-Bottom-Up segmentation -- is\nfound to have the best accuracy and the lowest computational complexity among\nall algorithms.

Therefore, it is of\ngreat interest to establish a relationship between the target temperature and\nother parameters of magnetron sputtering process such as the gas pressure and\nthe discharge power. This paper is devoted to the experimental and numerical\nstudies on titanium target temperature in Argon medium. Numerical simulations\nfor the target temperature are performed by solving the Heat equation for the\nmagnetron sputtering system enclosed in Argon filled chamber. The simulations\nare compared with the experimental temperature data. The difference between the\nsimulated results and experimental data on the power dependence of target\ntemperature is explained by an empirical model of heat transfer from the ions\nto the gas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2020 11:58:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-06"}

Reconnection generates magnetic islands: regions\nenclosed by magnetic field lines and separated by reconnection points. Proper\nidentification of these features is important to understand particle\nacceleration and overall behavior of plasma. We present a contour-tree based\nvisualization for robust and objective identification of islands and\nreconnection points in two-dimensional (2D) magnetic reconnection simulations.\nThe application of this visualization to a simple simulation has revealed a\nphysical phenomenon previously not reported, resulting in a more comprehensive\nunderstanding of magnetic reconnection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2020 20:46:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-06"}
