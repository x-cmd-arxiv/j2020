This usual\nmodel of gravastar with an equation of state (EOS) for vacuum energy inside the\ncore will be generalized for many modes of vacuum (dark energy star) in order\nto circumvent the embarrassment generated by the horizon singularity as the\nfinal stage of a gravitational collapse. In the place of the problem of a\nsingularity of an event horizon, we introduce a phase transition between\ngravity and anti-gravity before reaching the Schwarzschild (divergent) radius\n$R_S$ for a given coexistence radius $R_{coexistence}$ slightly larger than\n$R_S$ and slightly smaller than the core radius $R_{core}$ of GBEC, where the\nmetric of the repulsive sector (core of GBEC) would diverge for $r=R_{core}$,\nso that for such a given radius of phase coexistence $R_S<R_{coexistence}\n<R_{core}$, both divergences at $R_S$ of Schwarzschild metric and at $R_{core}$\nof the repulsive core are eliminated, thus preventing the formation of the\nevent horizon. So the causal structure of SSR helps us to elucidate such puzzle\nof singularity of event horizon by also providing a quantum interpretation for\nGBEC and thus by explaining the origin of a strong anisotropy due to the\nminimum speed that leads to the phase transition gravity/anti-gravity during\nthe collapse of the star. Furthermore, due to the absence of an event horizon\nof black hole (BH) where any signal cannot propagate, the new collapsed\nstructure presents a signal propagation in its region of coexistence of phases\nwhere the coexistence metric does not diverge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Sep 2020 16:58:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 17 Oct 2020 12:22:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-20"}

But RL for JSSP is usually done using a vectorized\nrepresentation of machine features as the state space. It has three major\nproblems: (1) the relationship between the machine units and the job sequence\nis not fully captured, (2) exponential increase in the size of the state space\nwith increasing machines/jobs, and (3) the generalization of the agent to\nunseen scenarios. We present a novel framework - GraSP-RL, GRAph neural\nnetwork-based Scheduler for Production planning problems using Reinforcement\nLearning. It represents JSSP as a graph and trains the RL agent using features\nextracted using a graph neural network (GNN). While the graph is itself in the\nnon-euclidean space, the features extracted using the GNNs provide a rich\nencoding of the current production state in the euclidean space, which is then\nused by the RL agent to select the next job. Further, we cast the scheduling\nproblem as a decentralized optimization problem in which the learning agent is\nassigned to all the production units and the agent learns asynchronously from\nthe data collected on all the production units. The GraSP-RL is then applied to\na complex injection molding production environment with 30 jobs and 4 machines.\nThe task is to minimize the makespan of the production plan. The schedule\nplanned by GraSP-RL is then compared and analyzed with a priority dispatch rule\nalgorithm like first-in-first-out (FIFO) and metaheuristics like tabu search\n(TS) and genetic algorithm (GA). The proposed GraSP-RL outperforms the FIFO,\nTS, and GA for the trained task of planning 30 jobs in JSSP. We further test\nthe generalization capability of the trained agent on two different problem\nclasses: Open shop system (OSS) and Reactive JSSP (RJSSP) where our method\nproduces results better than FIFO and comparable results to TS and GA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Sep 2020 16:05:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 May 2023 10:31:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-17"}

In pure water vapor at temperatures typical of ice\ncrystal formation in cirrus clouds, we find that basal and primary prismatic\nfacets exhibit a layer of premelted ice, with thickness in the subnanometer\nrange. For partial pressures of 1 bar, well above the expected values in the\ntroposphere, we find that only small amounts of nitrogen are adsorbed. The\nadsorption takes place onto the premelted surface, and hardly any nitrogen\ndissolves within the premelting film. The premelting film thickness does not\nchange either. We quantify the resulting change of the ice/vapor surface\ntension to be in the hundredth of mN/m and find that the structure of the\npristine ice surface is not changed in a significant manner. We perform a\ntrajectory analysis of colliding water molecules, and find that the attachment\nrates from direct ballistic collision are very close to unity irrespective of\nthe nitrogen pressure. Nitrogen is however at sufficient density to deflect a\nfraction of trajectories with smaller distance than the mean free path. Our\nresults show explicitly that the reported differences in growth rates measured\nin pure water vapor and a controlled nitrogen atmosphere are not related to a\nsignificant disruption of the ice surface due to nitrogen adsorption. On the\ncontrary, we show clearly from our trajectory analysis that nitrogen slows down\nthe crystal growth rates due to collisions between water molecules with bulk\nnitrogen gas. This clarifies the long standing controversy of the role of inert\ngases on crystal growth rates and demonstrates their influence is solely\nrelated to the diffusion limited flow of water vapor across the gas phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Sep 2020 16:20:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-09"}

Although multicore architectures are\nubiquitous, the state-of-the-art translation tools do not handle concurrency\nprimitives correctly. Doing so is rather challenging because of the subtle\ndifferences in the concurrency models between architectures.\n  In response, we address various aspects of the challenge. First, we develop\ncorrect and efficient translations between the concurrency models of two\nmainstream architecture families: x86 and ARM (versions 7 and 8). We develop\ndirect mappings between x86 and ARMv8 and ARMv7, and fence elimination\nalgorithms to eliminate redundant fences after direct mapping. Although our\nmapping utilizes ARMv8 as an intermediate model for mapping between x86 and\nARMv7, we argue that it should not be used as an intermediate model in a\ndecompiler because it disallows common compiler transformations.\n  Second, we propose and implement a technique for inserting memory fences for\nsafely migrating programs between different architectures.

Current Learning Management Systems (LMS) allow instructors to\ncreate quizzes through a Graphical User Interface. Despite having a smooth\nlearning curve, question generation/editing process with such interfaces is\noften slow and the creation of question variants is mostly limited to random\nparameters. In this paper we argue that procedural question generation greatly\nfacilitates the task of creating varied, formative, up-to-date, adaptive\nquestion banks for STEM quizzes. We present and evaluate a proof-of-concept\nPython API for script-based question generation, and propose different question\ndesign patterns that greatly facilitate question authoring. The API supports\nquestions including mathematical formulas, dynamically generated images and\nvideos, as well as interactive content such as 3D model viewers. Output\nquestions can be imported in major LMS. For basic usage, the required\nprogramming skills are minimal. More advanced uses do require some programming\nknowledge, but at a level that is common in STEM instructors. A side advantage\nof our system is that the question bank is actually embedded in Python code,\nmaking collaboration, version control, and maintenance tasks very easy. We\ndemonstrate the benefits of script-based generation over traditional GUI-based\napproaches, in terms of question richness, authoring speed and content\nre-usability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Sep 2020 17:15:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-09"}

The jets produced by gamma-ray bursts and\ntidal disruption events are accompanied by the accretion of material onto a\nblack hole or neutron star, with the accretion rate exceeding the Eddington\nlimit of the compact object by orders of magnitude. In such systems, radiation\ndominates the energy-momentum budget of the outflow, and the dynamical\nevolution of the jet is governed by the equations of radiation hydrodynamics.\nHere we show that there are analytic solutions to the equations of radiation\nhydrodynamics in the viscous (i.e., diffusive) regime that describe structured,\nrelativistic jets, which consist of a fast-moving, highly relativistic core\nsurrounded by a slower-moving, less relativistic sheath. In these solutions,\nthe slower-moving, outer sheath contains most of the mass, and the jet\nstructure is mediated by local anisotropies in the radiation field.

From their mid-infrared emission and compact\nmorphologies, these galaxies are estimated to have exceptionally large star\nformation rate (SFR) surface densities ($\\Sigma_{SFR} \\sim 10^{3}$\n$\\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$ yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$), approaching the Eddington limit for\nradiation pressure on dust grains. This suggests that star formation feedback\nmay be driving the observed outflows. However, these SFR estimates suffer from\nsignificant uncertainties. We therefore sought an independent tracer of star\nformation to probe the compact starburst activity in these systems. In this\npaper, we present SFR estimates calculated using 1.5 GHz continuum Jansky Very\nLarge Array observations for 19 of these galaxies. We also present updated\ninfrared (IR) SFRs calculated from WISE survey data. We estimate SFRs from the\nIR to be larger than those from the radio for 16 out of 19 galaxies by a median\nfactor of 2.5. We find that this deviation is maximized for the most compact\ngalaxies hosting the youngest stellar populations, suggesting that compact\nstarbursts deviate from the IR-radio correlation. We suggest that this\ndeviation stems either from free-free absorption of synchrotron emission, a\ndifference in the timescale over which each indicator traces star formation, or\nexceptionally hot IR-emitting dust in these ultra-dense galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Sep 2020 18:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-07"}

Little work has been done to examine the\nimpact of retrograde orbiters (ROs) on the formation and mergers of BBHs in AGN\ndisks. Quantifying the retrograde contribution is important, since roughly half\nof all orbiters should initially be on retrograde orbits when the disk forms.\nWe perform an analytic calculation of the evolution of ROs in an AGN disk.\nBecause this evolution could cause the orbits of ROs to cross those of prograde\nBBHs, we derive the collision rate between a given RO and a given BBH orbiting\nin the prograde direction.

Relativistically intense laser pulses incident on the outer surface of\na microtube target consisting of thin opaque shell surrounding a $\\mu$m-scale\ncylindrical void drive an initial ion implosion and later explosion capable of\ngenerating and subsequently amplifying strong magnetic fields. While the\nmagnetic field generation is enhanced and spatially smoothed by the application\nof a kilotesla-level seed field, the sign of the generated field does not\nalways follow the sign of the seed field. One unexpected consequence of the\namplification process is a reversal in the sign of the amplified magnetic field\nwhen, for example, the target outer cross section is changed from square to\ncircular. Using 2D particle-in-cell simulations, we demonstrate that sign\nreversal is linked to the stability of the surface magnetic field of opposite\nsign from the seed which arises at the target inner surface during laser\nirradiation. The stability of the surface magnetic field and consequently the\nsign of the final amplified field depends sensitively on the target, laser, and\nseed magnetic field conditions, which could be leveraged to make laser-driven\nmicrotube implosions an attractive platform for the study of magnetic fields in\nhigh energy density plasma in regimes where sign reversal either is or is not\ndesired.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Sep 2020 18:44:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}

As mission critical components are\nbecoming common in commodity systems; e.g., control of autonomous cars, the\ndemand for reliable processing has even further heightened. Latest process\ntechnologies even worsened the situation; thus, microprocessors design has\nbecome highly susceptible to reliability concerns. This paper examines\nasymmetric aging phenomenon, which is a major reliability concern in advanced\nprocess nodes. In this phenomenon, logical elements and memory cells suffer\nfrom unequal timing degradation over time and consequently introduce\nreliability concerns. So far, most studies approached asymmetric aging from\ncircuit or physical design viewpoint, but these solutions were quite limited\nand suboptimal. In this paper we introduce an asymmetric aging aware\nmicro-architecture that aims at reducing its impact. The study is mainly\nfocused on the following subsystems: execution units, register files and the\nmemory hierarchy. Our experiments indicate that the proposed solutions incur\nminimal overhead while significantly mitigating the asymmetric aging stress.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Sep 2020 18:56:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-10"}

The tomographic method, that relies\non the design of spectral masks containing lines forming in given ranges of\noptical depths in the stellar atmosphere, is an ideal technique for this\npurpose. It is applied to high-resolution spectro-interferometric VLTI/AMBER\nobservations of the Mira-type AGB star S Ori. First, the interferometric\nvisibilities are extracted at wavelengths contributing to the tomographic masks\nand fitted to those computed from a uniform disk model. This allows the\nmeasurement of the geometrical extent of the atmospheric layer probed by the\ncorresponding mask. Then, we compare the observed atmospheric extension with\nthose measured from available 1D pulsation CODEX models and 3D\nradiative-hydrodynamics CO5BOLD simulations. We found that while the average\noptical depths probed by the tomographic masks in S Ori decrease (with $<\\log\n\\tau_0> = -0.45$, $-1.45$, and $-2.45$ from the innermost to the central and\noutermost layers), the angular diameters of these layers increase, from 10.59\n$\\pm$ 0.09 mas through 11.84 $\\pm$ 0.17 mas, up to 14.08 $\\pm$ 0.15 mas. A\nsimilar behavior is observed when the tomographic method is applied to 1D and\n3D dynamical models. Thus, this study derives, for the first time, a\nquantitative relation between optical- and geometrical-depth scales when\napplied to the Mira star S Ori, or to 1D and 3D dynamical models. In the\ncontext of Mira-type stars, the knowledge of the link between the optical and\ngeometrical depths opens the way to derive the shock-wave propagation velocity,\nwhich can not be directly observed in these stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Sep 2020 19:12:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-28"}

The detector model for field quanta is a point-like system with a\nground state and a continuum of unbounded states. We employ the Glauber theory\nof photodetection. In an uniformly accelerated reference frame, the detector,\ninteracting with the field prepared in an arbitrary state of the Rindler Fock\nspace, is excited only by absorption processes. For the uniformly accelerated\ndetector prepared in the ground state, we evaluate the transition probability\nrate in three important situations. In the first one the field is prepared in\nan arbitrary state of $n$-Rindler quanta, then we consider a thermal Rindler\nstate at a given temperature $\\beta^{-1}$, and finally the case in which the\nstate of the field is taken to be the Minkowski vacuum. The well-known result\nthat the latter excitation rates are equal is recovered. Accelerated or\ninertial observer interpretations of the measurements performed by the\naccelerated detector is presented. Finally, we investigate the behaviour of the\ndetector in a frame which is inertial in the remote past but in the far future\nbecomes uniformly accelerated. For the massless case, we obtain that the\ntransition probability rate of the detector in the far future is tantamount to\nthe analogous quantity for the detector at rest in a non-inertial reference\nframe interacting with the field prepared in an usual thermal state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Sep 2020 19:36:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Apr 2021 15:23:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-05"}

We showed that the LTT effect\nwith one circumbinary body is the most likely cause for the OPV, which was\nreinforced by the orbital stability of the third body. The LTT best solution\nprovided an orbital period of ~24 yr for the outer body.

Thus, emergent information processing\ncapabilities can be understood from the perspective of a pressure towards high\nthermodynamic efficiency. On the other hand, the second law of thermodynamics\nplays a crucial role in the emergence of complex, self-organising dissipative\nstructures. Such structures are thermodynamically favoured, because they can\ndissipate free energy reservoirs, which would not be accessible otherwise.\nThereby, they allow a closed system to move from one meta-stable state to\nanother meta-stable state of higher entropy. This paper will argue, that these\ntwo views are not contradictory, but that their combination allows to\nunderstand the transition from simple self-organising dissipative structures to\ncomplex information processing systems. If the efficiency required by a\ndissipative structure to harvest enough work from the channeled flow of free\nenergy to maintain its own structure is high, there is a drive for this system\nto be predictive. Still, the existence of this dissipative system is\nthermodynamically favoured, compared to a situation without any dissipative\nstructure. Due to the emergence of a hierarchy of dissipative systems, which by\nthemselves are non-equilibrium structures that can be dissipated, such a drive\ndevelops naturally, as one ascends in this hierarchy further and further away\nfrom the initial driving disequilibrium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Sep 2020 21:55:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-10"}

In the meantime, with the advent of deep neural networks\n(DNNs), segmentation of brain lesions has matured significantly. However, few\nexisting approaches allow for the joint segmentation of normal tissue and brain\nlesions. Developing a DNN for such a joint task is currently hampered by the\nfact that annotated datasets typically address only one specific task and rely\non task-specific imaging protocols including a task-specific set of imaging\nmodalities.

Here we\npresent two questions about network building. 1) Can humans more easily learn\nsome types of networks than others? 2) Do humans find some links between ideas\nmore surprising than others? The answer to both questions is \"Yes,\" and we\nexplain why. The findings provide much-needed insight into the ways that humans\nlearn about the networked world around them.

Our results suggest that despite the\ngrowth in unemployment, the Gini of the equalised disposable income inequality\ndropped by nearly 0.03 point since February. The reduction is because of the\nadditional wage subsidies and welfare supports offered as part of the policy\nresponse, offsetting a potential surge in income inequality. Additionally, the\npoverty rate, which could have been doubled in the absence of the government\nresponse, also reduced by 3 to 4 percentage points. The result shows the\neffectiveness of temporary policy measures in maintaining both the living\nstandards and the level of income inequality.

Obtained results show that DL modeling attacks could\neasily break the security of 4-input XOR BR PUFs and 4-input XOR TBR PUFs with\nmodeling accuracy $\\sim$ 99%. Similar attacks were executed using single-layer\nneural networks (NN) and support vector machines (SVM) with polynomial kernel\nand the obtained results showed that single NNs failed to break the PUF\nsecurity. Furthermore, SVM results confirmed the same modeling accuracy\nreported in previous research ($\\sim$ 50%). For the first time, this research\nempirically shows that DL networks can be used as powerful modeling techniques\nagainst these complex PUF architectures for which previous conventional machine\nlearning techniques had failed. Furthermore, a detailed scalability analysis is\nconducted on the DL networks with respect to PUFs' stage size and complexity.\nThe analysis shows that the number of layers and hidden neurons inside every\nlayer has a linear relationship with PUFs' stage size, which agrees with the\ntheoretical findings in deep learning. Consequently, A new obfuscated\narchitecture is introduced as a first step to counter DL modeling attacks and\nit showed significant resistance against such attacks (16% - 40% less\naccuracy). This research provides an important step towards prioritizing the\nefforts to introduce new PUF architectures that are more secure and\ninvulnerable to modeling attacks. Moreover, it triggers future discussions on\nthe removal of influential bits and the level of obfuscation needed to confirm\nthat a specific PUF architecture is resistant against powerful DL modeling\nattacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Sep 2020 01:41:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-10"}

In the source\nregion, the continual emergence of two positive polarities (P1 and P2) that\nappeared as two pores (A and B)is unambiguous. Interestingly, P2 and Pore B\nslowly approached P1 and Pore A, implying a magnetic flux convergence. During\nthe emergence and convergence, P1 and P2 successively interacted with a minor\nnegative polarity (N3) that emerged, which led to a continuous magnetic flux\ncancellation. As a result, the overlying loops became much sheared and finally\nevolved into a tiny twisted flux rope that was evidenced by a transient inverse\nS-shaped sigmoid, the twisted filament threads with blueshift and redshift\nsignatures, and a hot channel. All the results show that the formation of the\ntiny flux rope in the center of the active region was closely associated with\nthe continuous magnetic flux emergence, convergence, and cancellation in the\nphotosphere. Hence, we suggest that the magnetic flux emergence, convergence,\nand cancellation are crucial for the formation of the tiny flux rope.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Sep 2020 02:49:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Sep 2020 02:38:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-21"}

The resulting expressions enable us to\nrelate the boundary-layer characteristics of a velocity profile, $u(y)$, to an\nassumed flow function and its wall derivative relative to the wall-normal\ncoordinate, $y$. Consequently, disturbance, displacement, and momentum\nthicknesses, as well as skin friction and drag coefficients, which are\ntypically evaluated and tabulated in classical monographs, can be readily\ndetermined for a given profile, $F(\\xi)=u/U$. Here $\\xi=y/\\delta$ denotes the\nboundary-layer coordinate. These expressions are then employed to provide a\nrational explanation for the 1921 Pohlhausen polynomial paradox, namely, the\nreason why a quartic representation of the velocity leads to less accurate\npredictions of the disturbance, displacement, and momentum thicknesses than\nusing cubic or quadratic polynomials. Not only do we identify the factors\nunderlying this behaviour, we proceed to outline a procedure to overcome its\nmanifestation at any order. This enables us to derive optimal piecewise\napproximations that do not suffer from the particular limitations affecting\nPohlhausen's $F(\\xi)=2\\xi-2\\xi^3 +\\xi^4$. For example, our alternative profile,\n$F(\\xi)=(5\\xi-3\\xi^3+\\xi^4)/3$, leads to an order-of-magnitude improvement in\nprecision when incorporated into the K\\'arm\\'an-Pohlhausen approach in both\nviscous and thermal analyses.

This paper focuses on\ndesigning an adaptive shared steering control system via sEMG (surface\nelectromyography) measurement from the forearm of the driver, and evaluates the\neffect of the system on driver behavior during a double lane change task. The\nshared steering control was achieved through a haptic guidance system which\nprovided active assistance torque on the steering wheel. Ten subjects\nparticipated in a high-fidelity driving simulator experiment. Two types of\nadaptive algorithms were investigated: haptic guidance decreases when driver\ngrip strength increases (HG-Decrease), and haptic guidance increases when\ndriver grip strength increases (HG-Increase). These two algorithms were\ncompared to manual driving and two levels of fixed authority haptic guidance,\nfor a total of five experimental conditions. Evaluation of the driving systems\nwas based on two sets of dependent variables: objective measures of driver\nbehavior and subjective measures of driver workload.

The problem of polaron has been studied by Feynman and others for\nordinary polar crystals. But the study of polaron formation in the context of\nthe above-mentioned 2D semi-metals having non-scalar effective Hamiltonians is\nnovel. When SL and BL graphene are grown on polar substrates, their electrons\ncan interact with the surface phonons of those polar substrates, as has been\ndiscussed by Fratini et al. That gives rise to the possibility of polaron\nformation in the context of SL and BL graphene, although they themselves are\nnon-polar. Semi-Dirac material, like SL and BL graphene, has been considered to\nbe grown on a polar substrate and the resulting polaron-dynamics has been\ninvestigated. As was discovered by Pardo and Pickett, the interfaces of\n(TiO_2)_5/(VO_2)_3 heterostructure, in which semi-Dirac dispersion was\nobserved, are non-polar. This justifies the treatment of semi-Dirac, for the\npurpose of this paper, in the same footing as non-polar materials like SL and\nBL graphene. The electron self energy, or polaron energy, calculated\nanalytically for BL graphene for small electron-momentum, is shown to vary\nlinearly with the electron momentum. Despite the similarity between BL graphene\nand ordinary polar crystals in the parabolic nature of the electronic\nband-structure in the absence of electron-phonon interaction, the linear\nenergy-momentum dispersion of BL graphene polarons stands in stark contrast to\nthe quadratic energy-momentum dispersion of the polarons produced in ordinary\npolar crystals.

Using feedback, the learning machine, driven purely by\nthermodynamic constraints, changes its internal states to learn probabilistic\nfunctional relations inherent in correlations between sensor and actuator\nrecords. We argue that these functional relations just are causal relations\nlearned by the agent, and so such causal relations are simply relations between\nthe internal physical states of a causal agent.

Existing learning based methods for text labeling task usually\nrequire a large amount of labeled examples to train a specific model for each\ntype of document. However, collecting large amounts of document images and\nlabeling them is difficult and sometimes impossible due to privacy issues.\nDeploying separate models for each type of document also consumes a lot of\nresources.

To alleviate\nthese problems, we proposed a novel deep end-to-end trainable approach for\none-shot text field labeling, which makes use of attention mechanism to\ntransfer the layout information between document images.

The rather similar\nlight curve behaviour indicate CSM interaction as the powering source.

We transfer\nrelational knowledge for deep metric learning by leveraging three kinds of\ndiversities in mutual learning: (1) model diversity from different\ninitializations of models, (2) temporal diversity from different frequencies of\nparameter update, and (3) view diversity from different augmentations of\ninputs.

In emerging economies such\nas India, the crop prices at marketplaces are manually entered every day, which\ncan be prone to human-induced errors like the entry of incorrect data or entry\nof no data for many days. In addition to such human prone errors, the\nfluctuations in the prices itself make the creation of stable and robust\nforecasting solution a challenging task. Considering such complexities in crop\nprice forecasting, in this paper, we present techniques to build robust crop\nprice prediction models considering various features such as (i) historical\nprice and market arrival quantity of crops, (ii) historical weather data that\ninfluence crop production and transportation, (iii) data quality-related\nfeatures obtained by performing statistical analysis.

We prove the convergence of this\nalgorithm. In intermediary steps of the proof, we propose the notion of\nmulti-affine extension and study its properties. We also prove the convergence\nof finite-dimensional GPs, when the knots are not dense in the input space,\nextending the recent literature. With simulated and real data, we demonstrate\nthat the MaxMod algorithm remains efficient in higher dimension (at least in\ndimension 20), and needs fewer knots than other constrained GP models from the\nstate-of-the-art, to reach a given approximation error.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Sep 2020 09:44:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Mar 2022 13:47:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-11"}

The BALs are detected tentatively in Mg II, Al III and\nreliably in HeI*3889, HeI*10830, which show complexed velocity structures\nsplitting into two components: a high-velocity component (HV), with a\nblueshifted velocity range of -9300 ~ -3500 km/s, can be reliably detected\ntentatively in Mg II, Al III and reliably in HeI* 10830, whereas it is\nundetectable in HeI* 3889; and low-Velocity component (LV), with the velocity\nof -3500 ~ -1800 km/s, is only detected in HeI*3889 and HeI* 10830. With the\nBALs from different ions, the HV outflowing gas can be constrained to have a\ndensity n_H~10^10.3-10^11.4 cm^-3, a column density N_H~10^21 cm^-2 and an\nionization parameter U~10^-1.83 - 10^-1.72; and thus inferring a distance of\nR_HV~0.5 pc from the central continuum source with a monochromatic luminosity\nof 7.0*10^45 erg/s at 5100 A.

Since the resulting protocol utilizes the channel more\naggressively than other ND protocols, beacons will collide more frequently.\nHence, due to collisions, the rate of successful discoveries gracefully\ndecreases for larger numbers of devices discovering each other simultaneously.\nWe also propose a scheme for configuring the BLE protocol (and not just\nBLE-\\textit{like} protocols).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Sep 2020 10:33:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-10"}

Additional standard-siren measurements from other types of future\ngravitational-wave sources (NS-BH and BBH) will provide more precision\nconstraints of this important cosmological parameter. Therefore, we obtain that\nfuture measurements of the luminosity distances of gravitational waves sources\nwill be much more competitive than the current analysis, which makes it\nexpectable more vigorous and convincing constraints on the Hubble constant in a\ncosmological-model-independent way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Sep 2020 10:44:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}

Previous works considered\nthe sojourn probability in the limit of vanishing tube radius, and employed the\nmetric induced by the diffusion tensor, rather than that of the ambient space,\nto define the tube enclosing the smooth path. This presents two difficulties in\nexperimentally measuring sojourn probabilities: first, the state-dependence of\nthe diffusion tensor is not known apriori, and second, the limit has to be\naccessed through a sequence of measurements at finite tube radius. Here we\ncircumvent these difficulties by obtaining a general expression for the sojourn\nprobability of $N$-dimensional It\\^o processes in tubes whose radii are small\nbut finite, and fixed by the metric of the ambient Euclidean space. The central\nquantity in our study is the rate at which trajectories leave the tube for the\nfirst time. This has an interpretation as a Lagrangian and can be measured\ndirectly in experiment. We find that this Lagrangian differs, in general, from\nthe Onsager-Machlup Lagrangian and has a form not previously reported in the\nliterature.

We\ndemonstrate that the most probable tube for a barrier crossing depends\nsensitively on the tube radius. We find that that while in the limit of\nvanishing tube radius the ratio of sojourn probabilities for a pair of distinct\npaths is in general divergent, the same for a path and its time-reversal is\nalways convergent and finite.

Souriau in the 1980s are a\nnatural generalization of smooth manifolds. However, optimization techniques\nare only known on manifolds so far. Generalizing these techniques to\ndiffeological spaces is very challenging because of several reasons. One of the\nmain reasons is that there are various definitions of tangent spaces which do\nnot coincide. Additionally, one needs to deal with a generalization of a\nRiemannian space in order to define gradients which are indispensable for\noptimization methods. This paper is devoted to an optimization technique on\ndiffeological spaces. Thus, one main aim of this paper is a suitable definition\nof a tangent space in view to optimization methods. Based on this definition,\nwe present a diffeological Riemannian space and a diffeological gradient, which\nwe need to formulate an optimization algorithm on diffeological spaces.\nMoreover, in order to be able to update the iterates in an optimization\nalgorithm on diffeological spaces, we present a diffeological retraction and\nthe Levi-Civita connection on diffeological spaces.

The core idea of\nmasking is to randomly split every sensitive intermediate variable during\ncomputation into at least t+1 shares, where t denotes the maximum number of\nshares that are allowed to be observed by an adversary without learning any\nsensitive information. In other words, it is assumed that the adversary is\nbounded either by the possessed number of probes (e.g., microprobe needles) or\nby the order of statistical analyses while conducting higher-order SCA attacks\n(e.g., differential power analysis). Such bounded models are employed to prove\nthe SCA security of the corresponding implementations. Consequently, it is\nbelieved that given a sufficiently large number of shares, the vast majority of\nknown SCA attacks are mitigated. In this work, we present a novel\nlaser-assisted SCA technique, called Laser Logic State Imaging (LLSI), which\noffers an unlimited number of contactless probes, and therefore, violates the\nprobing security model assumption. This technique enables us to take snapshots\nof hardware implementations, i.e., extract the logical state of all registers\nat any arbitrary clock cycle with a single measurement. To validate this, we\nmount our attack on masked AES hardware implementations and practically\ndemonstrate the extraction of the full-length key in two different scenarios.\nFirst, we assume that the location of the registers (key and/or state) is\nknown, and hence, their content can be directly read by a single snapshot.\nSecond, we consider an implementation with unknown register locations, where we\nmake use of multiple snapshots and a SAT solver to reveal the secrets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Sep 2020 12:30:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-22"}

We have determined the bandgap using the HSE06 (GGA) is 2.35\n(1.79) eV, which is an overestimated (underestimated) value of the experimental\nbandgap (1.99 eV).

Our goal is to go beyond the use of\nhigh-resolution simulations and train ML-based parametrisation using direct\ndata, in the realistic scenario of noisy and sparse observations.\n  The algorithm proposed in this work is a two-step process. First, data\nassimilation (DA) techniques are applied to estimate the full state of the\nsystem from a truncated model. The unresolved part of the truncated model is\nviewed as a model error in the DA system. In a second step, ML is used to\nemulate the unresolved part, a predictor of model error given the state of the\nsystem. Finally, the ML-based parametrisation model is added to the physical\ncore truncated model to produce a hybrid model.\n  The DA component of the proposed method relies on an ensemble Kalman filter\nwhile the ML parametrisation is represented by a neural network. The approach\nis applied to the two-scale Lorenz model and to MAOOAM, a reduced-order coupled\nocean-atmosphere model. We show that in both cases the hybrid model yields\nforecasts with better skill than the truncated model.

The topology of this field strongly influences the surface\ntemperature distribution, and hence the star's observational properties. In\nthis work, we present the first realistic simulations of the coupled crustal\nmagneto-thermal evolution of isolated neutron stars in three dimensions with\naccount for neutrino emission, obtained with the pseudo-spectral code Parody.\nWe investigate both the secular evolution, especially in connection with the\nonset of instabilities during the Hall phase, and the short-term evolution\nfollowing episodes of localised energy injection. Simulations show that a\nresistive tearing instability develops in about a Hall time if the initial\ntoroidal field exceeds ~$10^{15}$ G. This leads to crustal failures because of\nthe huge magnetic stresses coupled with the local temperature enhancement\nproduced by dissipation. Localised heat deposition in the crust results in the\nappearance of hot spots on the star surface which can exhibit a variety of\npatterns. Since the transport properties are strongly influenced by the\nmagnetic field, the hot regions tend to drift away and get deformed following\nthe magnetic field lines while cooling.

Part of the reason for this gap is that the sequential nature of\nextensive-form games allows for a richness of behaviors and incentives that are\nnot possible in normal-form settings. This richness translates to a\nsignificantly different complexity landscape surrounding extensive-form\ncorrelated equilibria. As of today, it is known that finding an optimal\nextensive-form correlated equilibrium (EFCE), extensive-form coarse correlated\nequilibrium (EFCCE), or normal-form coarse correlated equilibrium (NFCCE) in a\ntwo-player extensive-form game is computationally tractable when the game does\nnot include chance moves, and intractable when the game involves chance moves.\nIn this paper we significantly refine this complexity threshold by showing\nthat, in two-player games, an optimal correlated equilibrium can be computed in\npolynomial time, provided that a certain condition is satisfied. We show that\nthe condition holds, for example, when all chance moves are public, that is,\nboth players observe all chance moves. This implies that an optimal EFCE, EFCCE\nand NFCCE can be computed in polynomial time in the game size in two-player\ngames with public chance moves, providing the biggest positive complexity\nresult surrounding extensive-form correlation in more than a decade.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Sep 2020 14:51:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-10"}

Combined with VLA follow-up observations, we detect a total of\n34 CO $J \\rightarrow J-1$ transitions with $J=1$ up to $8$ (and an additional\n21 upper limits, up to $J=10$) and six [C I] ${^3P}_1 \\rightarrow {^3P}_0$ and\n${^3P}_2 \\rightarrow {^3P}_1$ transitions (and 12 upper limits). The CO(2-1)\nand CO(3-2)-selected galaxies, at $z=1.2$ and $2.5$, respectively, exhibit a\nrange in excitation in their mid-$J=4,5$ and high-$J=7,8$ lines, on average\nlower than ($L_{\\rm IR}$-brighter) BzK-color- and submillimeter-selected\ngalaxies at similar redshifts. The former implies that a warm ISM component is\nnot necessarily prevalent in gas mass-selected galaxies at $z=1.2$.

We propose an\nactor-critic algorithm to iteratively compute the mean-field equilibrium (MFE)\nof the LQ-MFG. There are two primary challenges: i) the non-stationarity of the\nMFG induces a linear-quadratic tracking problem, which requires solving a\nbackwards-in-time (non-causal) equation that cannot be solved by standard\n(causal) RL algorithms; ii) Many RL algorithms assume that the states are\nsampled from the stationary distribution of a Markov chain (MC), that is, the\nchain is already mixed, an assumption that is not satisfied for real data\nsources. We first identify that the mean-field trajectory follows linear\ndynamics, allowing the problem to be reformulated as a linear quadratic\nGaussian problem. Under this reformulation, we propose an actor-critic\nalgorithm that allows samples to be drawn from an unmixed MC. Finite-sample\nconvergence guarantees for the algorithm are then provided.

The\nBB boundary prevents the LBM from capturing the accurate shear drag on the wall\nwhen addressing high Reynolds number flows using coarse-grid systems. In this\nstudy, we proposed a \"wall-function bounce (WFB)\" boundary that incorporates a\nwall function into the LBM's boundary condition and overcomes the limitation of\nthe BB. The WFB boundary calculates the appropriate shear drag on the wall\nusing a wall function model, and thereafter modifies distribution functions to\nreflect the shear drag. The Spalding's law was utilized as the wall function in\nWFB. Simulations of turbulent channel flow at $Re_{\\tau}$=640 and 2003 using\nthe LBM-based large-eddy simulation (LBM-LES) were conducted to validate the\neffectiveness of the proposed boundary condition. The results indicate that the\nBB boundary underestimated the time-averaged velocity in the buffer layer at\n$Re_{\\tau}$=640, and the averaged velocity in the entire domain at\n$Re_{\\tau}$=2003, when using coarse-grid systems. However, WFB obtained the\nproper shear drag on the wall and thus, compensated for the underestimation and\nagreed better with the experimental or DNS data, especially at the first-layer\ngrid. In addition, WFB improved the Reynolds normal stress in the near-wall\nregion to some extent. The distributions of shear stress on the wall by WFB was\nanalogous to those by the wall model function in the finite volume method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Sep 2020 15:20:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-01"}

Wave-heating via phase-mixing of Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)\ntransverse waves has been proposed as a possible way to convert magnetic energy\ninto thermal energy but increasingly, MHD models suggest this is not a\nsufficiently efficient mechanism. We model heating by phase-mixing of\ntransverse MHD waves in various configurations, to investigate whether certain\ncircumstances can enhance the heating sufficiently to sustain the million\ndegree solar corona and to assess the impact of the propagation and\nphase-mixing of transverse MHD waves on the structure of the boundary shell of\ncoronal loops. We use 3D MHD simulations of a pre-existing density enhancement\nin magnetised medium and a boundary driver to trigger the propagation of\ntransverse waves with the same power spectrum as measured by the COmP. We\nconsider different density structures, boundary conditions at the non-drive\nfootpoint, characteristics of the driver, and different forms of magnetic\nresistivity. We find that different initial density structures affect the\nevolution of the boundary shell and some driver configurations enhance the\nheating generated from the dissipation of the MHD waves. In particular, drivers\ncoherent on a larger spatial scale and higher dissipation coefficients generate\nsignificant heating, although it is still insufficient. We conclude that while\nphase-mixing of transverse MHD waves is unlikely to sustain the thermal\nstructure of the corona, there are configurations that allow for an enhanced\nefficiency of this mechanism. We provide possible signatures to identify the\npresence of such configurations, such as the location of where the heating is\ndeposited along the coronal loop\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Sep 2020 15:36:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-11"}

For each input,\nthese network architectures activate a different path through a network of\nexperts. Routing networks have been shown to learn to route similar tasks to\noverlapping sets of experts and dissimilar tasks to disjoint sets of experts.\nIn the continual learning context this behaviour is desirable as it minimizes\ninterference between dissimilar tasks while allowing positive transfer between\nrelated tasks. In practice, we find it is necessary to develop a new training\nmethod for routing networks, which we call co-training which avoids poorly\ninitialized experts when new tasks are presented.

The reduced\nbasis method (RBM) presents as such an option. Enabled by a mathematically\nrigorous error estimator, RBM constructs a low-dimensional subspace of the\nparameter-induced high fidelity solution manifold from which an approximate\nsolution is computed. It can improve efficiency by several orders of magnitudes\nleveraging an offline-online decomposition procedure. However, this\ndecomposition, usually through the empirical interpolation method (EIM) when\nthe PDE is nonlinear or its parameter dependence nonaffine, is either\nchallenging to implement, or severely degrades online efficiency.\n  In this paper, we augment and extend the EIM approach as a direct solver, as\nopposed to an assistant, for solving nonlinear pPDEs on the reduced level. The\nresulting method, called Reduced Over-Collocation method (ROC), is stable and\ncapable of avoiding the efficiency degradation inherent to a traditional\napplication of EIM. Two critical ingredients of the scheme are collocation at\nabout twice as many locations as the dimension of the reduced solution space,\nand an efficient L1-norm-based error indicator for the strategic selection of\nthe parameter values to build the reduced solution space. Together, these two\ningredients render the proposed L1-ROC scheme both offline- and\nonline-efficient. A distinctive feature is that the efficiency degradation\nappearing in alternative RBM approaches that utilize EIM for nonlinear and\nnonaffine problems is circumvented, both in the offline and online stages.\nNumerical tests on different families of time-dependent and steady-state\nnonlinear problems demonstrate the high efficiency and accuracy of L1-ROC and\nits superior stability performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Sep 2020 20:14:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-11"}

Meanwhile, learning-based\napproaches, such as deep unfolding algorithms, are highly limited by the lack\nof labelled data and restricted explainability. To tackle these issues, we\npropose a meta-learning based alternating minimization (MLAM) method, which\naims to minimize a partial of the global losses over iterations instead of\ncarrying minimization on each sub-problem, and it tends to learn an adaptive\nstrategy to replace the handcrafted counterpart resulting in advance on\nsuperior performance.

To achieve it, traditionally formal\nreporting systems like VAERS support accurate but delayed surveillance, while\nrecently social media have been mined for timely but noisy observations.\nUtilizing the complementary strengths of these two domains to boost the\ndetection performance looks good but cannot be effectively achieved by existing\nmethods due to significant differences between their data characteristics,\nincluding: 1) formal language v.s. informal language, 2) single-message per\nuser v.s. multi-messages per user, and 3) one class v.s. binary class. In this\npaper, we propose a novel generic framework named Multi-instance Domain\nAdaptation (MIDA) to maximize the synergy between these two domains in the\nvaccine adverse event detection task for social media users. Specifically, we\npropose a generalized Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) criterion to measure the\nsemantic distances between the heterogeneous messages from these two domains in\ntheir shared latent semantic space. Then these message-level generalized MMD\ndistances are synthesized by newly proposed mixed instance kernels to\nuser-level distances.

In\nthis paper we present an alternative approach, which requires to solve only\nlinear systems of equations involving sparse matrices. Furthermore, the\nproposed method provides a reliable and numerically stable way to obtain\nstability parameters in multidimensional systems, which are of particular\ninterest in the context of microcanonical instanton theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Sep 2020 14:17:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-15"}

One of the first\nspectrums to embrace this evolution was the banking sector. In fact, the first\nknown online banking service came in 1980. It was deployed from a community\nbank located in Knoxville, called the United American Bank. Since then,\ninternet banking has been offering ease and efficiency to costumers in\ncompleting their daily banking tasks.\n  The ever increasing use of internet banking and a large number of online\ntransactions increased fraudulent behavior also. As if fraud increase was not\nenough, the massive number of online transactions further increased the data\ncomplexity. Modern data sources are not only complex but generated at high\nspeed and in real-time as well. This presents a serious problem and a definite\nreason why more advanced solutions are desired to protect financial service\ncompanies and credit cardholders.\n  Therefore, this research paper aims to construct an efficient fraud detection\nmodel which is adaptive to customer behavior changes and tends to decrease\nfraud manipulation, by detecting and filtering fraud in real-time. In order to\nachieve this aim, a review of various methods is conducted, adding above a\npersonal experience working in the Banking sector, specifically in the Fraud\nDetection office. Unlike the majority of reviewed methods, the proposed model\nin this research paper is able to detect fraud in the moment of occurrence\nusing an incremental classifier. The evaluation of synthetic data, based on\nfraud scenarios selected in collaboration with domain experts that replicate\ntypical, real-world attacks, shows that this approach correctly ranks complex\nfrauds. In particular, our proposal detects fraudulent behavior and anomalies\nwith up to 97\\% detection rate while maintaining a satisfyingly low cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Sep 2020 20:58:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-15"}
