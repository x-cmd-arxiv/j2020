In this context, development of supporting software\nforms the core part of the IoT infrastructure. A Middleware sits in between the\nIoT devices and interacts between them to exchange data among the components of\nthe automated architecture. The Middleware services include hand shaking, data\ntransfer and security among its core set of functionalities. It also includes\ncross-cutting functional services such as authentication, logging and caching.\nA software that can run these Middleware services requires a careful choice of\na good software modelling technique. Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is a\nsoftware development methodology that can be used to independently encapsulate\nthe core and cross-cutting functionalities of the Middleware services of the\nIoT infrastructure. In this paper, an attempt has been made using a simulation\nenvironment to independently model the two orthogonal functionalities of the\nMiddleware with the focus to improve its modularity. Further, a quantitative\nmeasurement of the core design property of cohesion has been done to infer on\nthe improvement in the reusability of the modules encapsulated in the\nMiddleware of IoT. Based on the measurement, it was found that the modularity\nand reusability of functionalities in the Middleware software has improved in\nthe AspectJ version compared to its equivalent Java version.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 2020 16:01:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-24"}

It\nroutinely occurs in granular and porous media, can strongly alter such\nproperties as adhesion, lubrication, friction and corrosion, and is important\nin many processes employed by microelectronics, pharmaceutical, food and other\nindustries. The century-old Kelvin equation is commonly used to describe\ncondensation phenomena and shown to hold well for liquid menisci with diameters\nas small as several nm. For even smaller capillaries that are involved in\ncondensation under ambient humidity and, hence, of particular practical\ninterest, the Kelvin equation is expected to break down, because the required\nconfinement becomes comparable to the size of water molecules. Here we take\nadvantage of van der Waals assembly of two-dimensional crystals to create\natomic-scale capillaries and study condensation inside. Our smallest\ncapillaries are less than 4 angstroms in height and can accommodate just a\nmonolayer of water. Surprisingly, even at this scale, the macroscopic Kelvin\nequation using the characteristics of bulk water is found to describe\naccurately the condensation transition in strongly hydrophilic (mica)\ncapillaries and remains qualitatively valid for weakly hydrophilic (graphene)\nones. We show that this agreement is somewhat fortuitous and can be attributed\nto elastic deformation of capillary walls, which suppresses giant oscillatory\nbehavior expected due to commensurability between atomic-scale confinement and\nwater molecules.

A\n'secure aggregation' protocol enables the server to aggregate clients' models\nin a privacy-preserving manner. However, existing secure aggregation protocols\nincur high computation/communication costs, especially when the number of model\nparameters is larger than the number of clients participating in an iteration\n-- a typical scenario in federated learning.\n  In this paper, we propose a secure aggregation protocol, FastSecAgg, that is\nefficient in terms of computation and communication, and robust to client\ndropouts. The main building block of FastSecAgg is a novel multi-secret sharing\nscheme, FastShare, based on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), which may be of\nindependent interest. FastShare is information-theoretically secure, and\nachieves a trade-off between the number of secrets, privacy threshold, and\ndropout tolerance. Riding on the capabilities of FastShare, we prove that\nFastSecAgg is (i) secure against the server colluding with 'any' subset of some\nconstant fraction (e.g. $\\sim10\\%$) of the clients in the honest-but-curious\nsetting; and (ii) tolerates dropouts of a 'random' subset of some constant\nfraction (e.g. $\\sim10\\%$) of the clients. FastSecAgg achieves significantly\nsmaller computation cost than existing schemes while achieving the same\n(orderwise) communication cost. In addition, it guarantees security against\nadaptive adversaries, which can perform client corruptions dynamically during\nthe execution of the protocol.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 2020 16:49:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-24"}

Deploying unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for turbine inspection\nis considered as a viable alternative to manual inspections. An important\nobjective of automated UAV inspection is to minimize the flight time of the\nUAVs to inspect all the turbines. A first contribution of this paper is thus\nformulating an optimization problem to compute the optimal routes for turbine\ninspection satisfying the above goal. On the other hand, the limited\ncomputational capability on UAVs can be used to increase the power generation\nof wind turbine. Power generation from the turbines can be optimized by\ncontrolling the yaw angle of the turbines. Forecasting wind conditions such as\nwind speed and wind direction is crucial for solving both optimization\nproblems. Therefore, UAVs can utilize their limited computational capability to\nperform wind forecasting. In this way, UAVs form edge intelligence in offshore\nwind farm. With the forecasted wind conditions, we design two algorithms to\nsolve the formulated problems, and then evaluate the proposed methods with\nrealworld data.

First,\nwe show that the activation of quantum maps through the quantum switch model\nalways entails a non-negative gain in ergotropy compared to their consecutive\napplication. We also establish a condition that the maps should fulfill in\norder to achieve a non-zero ergotropic gain. We then perform a thorough\nanalysis of maps applied to a two-level system and provide general conditions\nfor achieving a positive gain on the incoherent part of ergotropy.

The major difficulty for\nimplementing a Newton-type method to compute the projection of a given large\nscale matrix onto the DNN cone lies in the possible failure of the constraint\nnondegeneracy, a generalization of the linear independence constraint\nqualification for nonlinear programming. Such a failure results in the\nsingularity of the Jacobian of the nonsmooth equation representing the\nKarush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality condition that prevents the semismooth Newton-CG\nmethod from solving it with a desirable convergence rate.

Understanding the thermal structures and spectral\nappearances of mini-Neptunes is important to understand various aspects of\ntheir atmospheres, including radiative/convective energy transport, boundary\nconditions for the interior, and their potential habitability. In the present\nstudy, we explore these aspects of mini-Neptunes using self-consistent models\nof their atmospheres.

To allow for better training and robust evaluation of\nmodel-based metrics, we introduce the DailyDialog++ dataset, consisting of (i)\nfive relevant responses for each context and (ii) five adversarially crafted\nirrelevant responses for each context.

Each arm (or\nexpert) represents a distinct cache replacement policy, which advises on the\npage to evict from the cache when needed. Feedback on the eviction comes in the\nform of a \"miss\", but at an indeterminate time after the action is taken, and\nthe cost of the eviction is set to be inversely proportional to the response\ntime. The feedback is ignored if it comes after a threshold value for the\ndelay, which we set to be equal to the size of the page eviction history. Thus,\nfor delays beyond the threshold, its cost is assumed to be zero. Consequently,\nwe call this problem with delayed feedback and decaying costs. We introduce an\nadaptive reinforcement learning algorithm EXP4-DFDC that provides a solution to\nthe problem. We derive an optimal learning rate for EXP4-DFDC that defines the\nbalance between exploration and exploitation and proves theoretically that the\nexpected regret of our algorithm is a vanishing quantity as a function of time.\nAs an application, we show that LeCaR, a recent top-performing machine learning\nalgorithm for cache replacement, can be enhanced with adaptive learning using\nour formulations. We present an improved adaptive version of LeCaR, called\nOLeCaR, with the learning rate set as determined by the theoretical derivation\npresented here to minimize regret for EXP4-DFDC. It then follows that LeCaR and\nOLeCaR are theoretically guaranteed to have vanishing regret over time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 2020 18:26:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Sep 2020 04:46:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 18 May 2021 16:52:38 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 19 May 2021 04:32:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-20"}

Such waves are\ngenerally classed as either pulled, where the dynamics are driven by the very\ntip of the front and stochastic fluctuations are high, or pushed, where\ncooperation in growth or dispersal results in a bulk-driven wave in which\nfluctuations are suppressed. These concepts have been well studied\nexperimentally in populations where the cooperation leads to a\ndensity-dependent growth rate. By contrast, relatively little is known about\nexperimental populations that exhibit density-dependent dispersal.\n  Using bacteriophage T7 as a test organism, we present novel experimental\nmeasurements that demonstrate that the diffusion of phage T7, in a lawn of host\nE. coli, is hindered by steric interactions with host bacteria cells. The\ncoupling between host density, phage dispersal and cell lysis caused by viral\ninfection results in an effective density-dependent diffusion coefficient akin\nto cooperative behavior. Using a system of reaction-diffusion equations, we\nshow that this effect can result in a transition from a pulled to pushed\nexpansion. Moreover, we find that a second, independent density-dependent\neffect on phage dispersal spontaneously emerges as a result of the viral\nincubation period, during which phage is trapped inside the host unable to\ndisperse. Additional stochastic agent-based simulations reveal that lysis time\ndramatically affects the rate of diversity loss in viral expansions. Taken\ntogether, our results indicate both that bacteriophage can be used as a\ncontrollable laboratory population to investigate the impact of\ndensity-dependent dispersal on evolution, and that the genetic diversity and\nadaptability of expanding viral populations could be much greater than is\ncurrently assumed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 2020 19:59:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Oct 2020 10:11:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 18 Apr 2021 15:06:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-07"}

For certain driving angles, the flow is reduced or drops to\nzero when the system forms a heterogeneous clogged state consisting of high\ndensity clogged regions coexisting with empty regions. The clogged states are\nfragile and can be unclogged by changing the driving angle. For large obstacle\nsizes, we find a uniform clogged state that is distinct from the collective\nclogging regime. Within the clogged phases, depinning transitions can occur as\na function of increasing driving force, with strongly intermittent motion\nappearing just above the depinning threshold. The clogging is robust against\nthe random removal or dilution of the obstacle sites, and the disks are able to\nform system-spanning clogged clusters even under increasing dilution.

While literature on statistical modeling of network data\ntypically involves analysis of a single network, the recent emergence of\ncomplex data in several biological applications, including brain imaging\nstudies, presents a need to devise a network classifier for subjects. This\narticle considers an application from a brain connectome study, where the\noverarching goal is to classify subjects into two separate groups based on\ntheir brain network data, along with identifying influential regions of\ninterest (ROIs) (referred to as nodes). Existing approaches either treat all\nedge weights as a long vector or summarize the network information with a few\nsummary measures. Both these approaches ignore the full network structure, may\nlead to less desirable inference in small samples and are not designed to\nidentify significant network nodes.

Semi-supervised learning (SSL) mitigates this challenge by\nexploiting the behavior of the neural function on large unlabeled data. The\nsmoothness of the neural function is a commonly used assumption exploited in\nSSL. A successful example is the adoption of mixup strategy in SSL that\nenforces the global smoothness of the neural function by encouraging it to\nbehave linearly when interpolating between training examples. Despite its\nempirical success, however, the theoretical underpinning of how mixup\nregularizes the neural function has not been fully understood. In this paper,\nwe offer a theoretically substantiated proposition that mixup improves the\nsmoothness of the neural function by bounding the Lipschitz constant of the\ngradient function of the neural networks. We then propose that this can be\nstrengthened by simultaneously constraining the Lipschitz constant of the\nneural function itself through adversarial Lipschitz regularization,\nencouraging the neural function to behave linearly while also constraining the\nslope of this linear function. On three benchmark data sets and one real-world\nbiomedical data set, we demonstrate that this combined regularization results\nin improved generalization performance of SSL when learning from a small amount\nof labeled data.

The photon and its Kaluza-Klein partners in\nthis extended space-time will involve a pair of vector fields together with a\nscalar field, which describes a pair of local jumping between the layers. The\nquartic potential of the scalar field triggers an abelian Higgs mechanism,\nwhich gives a mass to one vector field, which describes a short-range\ninteraction. The discrete derivative along the extra dimension generates a\nnon-diagonal mass matrix, whose eigenstates mix the fermions on two layers with\na mixing angle. The couplings of the Kaluza-Klein siblings of photon including\nmassless, massive, and scalar ones with the mass eigenstates of fermions will\nalso depend on the mixing angle.

In the literature, a\nmodel-based method relies on a model which is subject to the risk of model\nmisspecification, while a model-free method only provides a correlation measure\nwhich is inadequate to test independence. In this paper, we adopt the\nHilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) to measure the dependency between\ntwo random functions.

The availability of data on the condition of civil infrastructure\nimmediately after an earthquake is of great importance for emergency\nmanagement. Stakeholders require this information to take effective actions and\nto better recover from the disaster. The data-driven SHM has shown great\npromises to achieve this goal in near real-time. There have been several\nproposals to automate the inspection process from different sources of input\nusing deep learning. The existing models in the literature only provide a final\nprediction output, while the risks of utilizing such models for safety-critical\nassessments should not be ignored. This paper is dedicated to developing deep\nBayesian U-Nets where the uncertainty of predictions is a second output of the\nmodel, which is made possible through Monte Carlo dropout sampling in test\ntime. Based on a grid-like data structure, the concept of semantic damage\nsegmentation (SDS) is revisited. Compared to image segmentation, it is shown\nthat a much higher level of precision is necessary for damage diagnosis. To\nvalidate and test the proposed framework, a benchmark dataset, 10,800 nonlinear\nresponse history analyses on a 10-story-10-bay 2D reinforced concrete moment\nframe, is utilized. Compared to the benchmark SDS model, Bayesian models\nexhibit superior robustness with enhanced global and mean class accuracies.\nFinally, the model's uncertainty output is studied by monitoring the softmax\nclass variance of different predictions. It is shown that class variance\ncorrelates well with locations where the model makes mistakes. This output can\nbe used in combination with the prediction results to increase the reliability\nof this data-driven framework in structural inspections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Sep 2020 03:12:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-25"}

Recent research has questioned the fairness of this\ntechnology across gender and race.

However, to date, the majority of existing studies were limited to\nAfrican-American and Caucasian only. The aim of this paper is to investigate\nthe differential performance of the gender classification algorithms across\ngender-race groups. To this aim, we investigate the impact of (a) architectural\ndifferences in the deep learning algorithms and (b) training set imbalance, as\na potential source of bias causing differential performance across gender and\nrace. Experimental investigations are conducted on two latest large-scale\npublicly available facial attribute datasets, namely, UTKFace and FairFace. The\nexperimental results suggested that the algorithms with architectural\ndifferences varied in performance with consistency towards specific gender-race\ngroups. For instance, for all the algorithms used, Black females (Black race in\ngeneral) always obtained the least accuracy rates. Middle Eastern males and\nLatino females obtained higher accuracy rates most of the time. Training set\nimbalance further widens the gap in the unequal accuracy rates across all\ngender-race groups. Further investigations using facial landmarks suggested\nthat facial morphological differences due to the bone structure influenced by\ngenetic and environmental factors could be the cause of the least performance\nof Black females and Black race, in general.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Sep 2020 04:56:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-25"}

The latter implies a significant\ncontribution of MCGs to the Cosmic Dawn, if confirmed to be cosmological. We\nthen perform Bayesian inference on two models including and ignoring MCG\ncontributions. Comparing their Bayesian evidences, we find a strong preference\nfor the model including MCGs, despite the fact that it has more free\nparameters. This suggests that if MCGs indeed play a significant role in the\nCosmic Dawn, it should be possible to infer their properties from upcoming\n21-cm power spectra.

CAlcium fluoride for studies of Neutrino and Dark matters by Low Energy\nSpectrometer (CANDLES) discerns the $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ of $^{48}$Ca using a\nCaF$_2$ scintillator as the detector and source. Photomultiplier tubes (PMTs)\ncollect scintillation photons. At the Q-value of $^{48}$Ca, the current energy\nresolution (2.6%) exceeds the ideal statistical fluctuation of the number of\nphotoelectrons (1.6%). Because of CaF$_2$'s long decay constant of 1000 ns, a\nsignal integration within 4000 ns is used to calculate the energy. The baseline\nfluctuation ($\\sigma_{baseline}$) is accumulated in the signal integration,\nthus degrading the energy resolution. This paper studies $\\sigma_{baseline}$ in\nthe CANDLES detector, which severely degrades the resolution by 1% at the\nQ-value of $^{48}$Ca. To avoid $\\sigma_{\\rm baseline}$, photon counting can be\nused to obtain the number of photoelectrons in each PMT; however, a significant\nphotoelectron signal overlapping probability in each PMT causes missing\nphotoelectrons in counting and reduces the energy resolution. \"Partial photon\ncounting\" reduces $\\sigma_{baseline}$ and minimizes photoelectron loss.

Unfortunately, the phase is wrapped in most imaging system.\nPhase unwrapping is the computational process that recovers a more informative\nimage. It is particularly challenging with thick and complex samples such as\norganoids. Recent works that rely on supervised training show that deep\nlearning is a powerful method to unwrap the phase; however, supervised\napproaches require large and representative datasets which are difficult to\nobtain for complex biological samples. Inspired by the concept of deep image\npriors, we propose a deep-learning-based method that does not need any training\nset. Our framework relies on an untrained convolutional neural network to\naccurately unwrap the phase while ensuring the consistency of the measurements.\nWe experimentally demonstrate that the proposed method faithfully recovers the\nphase of complex samples on both real and simulated data.

Here, we demonstrate\nhypersensitive nanoscale IR spectra and imaging in aqueous environment with the\ncombination of photoinduced force (PiF) microscopy and resonant antennas. The\nhighly confined electromagnetic field inbetween the tip end and antenna\nextremely amplifies the photoinduced force to the detectable level, while the\nexcitation via plasmon internal reflection mode minimizes the environmental\nabsorption. A polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) layer (~1-2 nm thickness)\nfunctionalized on the AFM tip has been successfully identified in water with\nantennas of different sizes. Sampling volume of ~604 chemical bonds from PDMS\nwas demonstrated with sub-10 nm spatial resolution confirmed by electric (E)\nfield distribution mapping on antennas, which strongly suggests the desired\nrequirements for interfacial spectroscopy.

We analyzed the protocols and\noptimization methods using various workload parameters and a thread count of\n224. Previous studies focused on thread scalability and did not explore the\nspace analyzed here. We classified the optimization methods on the basis of\nthree performance factors: CPU cache, delay on conflict, and version lifetime.\nAnalyses using CCBench and 224 threads, produced six insights. (I1) The\nperformance of optimistic concurrency control protocol for a read only workload\nrapidly degrades as cardinality increases even without L3 cache misses. (I2)\nSilo can outperform TicToc for some write-intensive workloads by using\ninvisible reads optimization. (I3) The effectiveness of two approaches to\ncoping with conflict (wait and no-wait) depends on the situation. (I4) OCC\nreads the same record two or more times if a concurrent transaction\ninterruption occurs, which can improve performance.

While traditional\nhashing techniques produce binary sketches, recent ones produce integer\nsketches for preserving various similarity measures. However, most similarity\nsearch methods are designed for binary sketches and inefficient for integer\nsketches. Moreover, most methods are either inapplicable or inefficient for\ndynamic datasets, although modern real-world datasets are updated over time. We\npropose dynamic filter trie (DyFT), a dynamic similarity search method for both\nbinary and integer sketches. An extensive experimental analysis using large\nreal-world datasets shows that DyFT performs superiorly with respect to\nscalability, time performance, and memory efficiency.

The unusual transport and optical properties of these materials\noriginate mainly from triangular lattices (TLs).

The transmission coefficient of 2D TLs is calculated by\nusing the Green's function technique to treat ballistic transports. Especially\nimportant among our findings is the electron-hole asymmetric behavior of the\npower factor ($PF$). Specifically, the maximum $PF$ of electrons is\nsignificantly larger than that of holes. At room temperature, the maximum $PF$\nof electrons is dictated by the position of the chemical potential of\nelectrodes near the band edge of TLs. The enhancement of $PF$ with increasing\nelectronic states results from the enhancement of electrical conductance and\nconstant Seebeck coefficient. When the band gap is ten times larger than the\nthermal energy, it is appropriate to make one-band model predictions for\nthermoelectric optimization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Sep 2020 09:44:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-25"}

The formalism also allows making numerical predictions for\na wide number of observables with the same parameter set fixed to standard\nliterature values. In this proceedings, we overview our recently developed\nDREENA-C and DREENA-B frameworks, where DREENA is a computational\nimplementation of the dynamical energy loss formalism, and where C stands for\nconstant temperature QCD medium, while B stands for the medium modeled by 1+1D\nBjorken expansion. At constant temperature our predictions overestimate $v_2$,\nin contrast to other models, but consistent with simple analytical estimates.\nWith Bjorken expansion, we have a good agreement of the predictions with both\n$R_{AA}$ and $v_2$ measurements. We find that introducing medium evolution has\na larger effect on $v_2$ predictions, but for precision predictions it has to\nbe taken into account in $R_{AA}$ predictions as well. Based on numerical\ncalculations and simple analytical derivations, we also propose a new\nobservable, which we call path length sensitive suppression ratio, for which we\nargue that the path length dependence can be assessed in a straightforward\nmanner. We also argue that $Pb+Pb$ vs. $Xe+Xe$ measurements make a good system\nto assess the path length dependence. As an outlook, we expect that\nintroduction of more complex medium evolution (beyond Bjorken expansion) in the\ndynamical energy loss formalism can provide a basis for a state of the art QGP\ntomography tool - e.g. to jointly constrain the medium properties from the\npoint of both high pt and low pt data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Sep 2020 10:03:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-25"}

Recently, in the\ncontext of Degenerate Higher-Order Scalar-Tensor (DHOST) theories it was shown\nthat stealth de Sitter solutions suffer from either infinite strong coupling or\ngradient instability for scalar field perturbations. The sound speed squared is\neither vanishing or negative. In the first case, the strong coupling scale is\nzero and thus lower than the energy scale of any physical phenomena. From the\nviewpoint of effective field theory, this issue is naturally resolved by\nintroducing a controlled detuning of the degeneracy condition dubbed\nscordatura, recovering a version of ghost condensation. In this paper we\nconstruct a viable dark energy model in the scordatura DHOST theory based on a\nstealth cosmological solution, in which the metric is the same as in the\nstandard $\\Lambda$CDM model and the scalar field profile is linearly\ntime-dependent. We show that the scordatura mechanism resolves the strong\ncoupling and gradient instability. Further, we find that the scordatura is also\nnecessary to make the quasi-static limit well-defined, which implies that the\nsubhorizon observables are inevitably affected by the scordatura. We derive the\neffective gravitational coupling and the correction to the friction term for\nthe subhorizon evolution of the linear dark matter energy density contrast as\nwell as the Weyl potential and the gravitational slip parameter. In the absence\nof the scordatura, the quasi-static approximation would break down at all\nscales around stealth cosmological solutions even if the issue of the infinite\nstrong coupling is unjustly disregarded. Therefore previous estimations of the\nsubhorizon evolution of matter density contrast in modified gravity in the\nliterature need to be revisited by taking into account the scordatura effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Sep 2020 11:25:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Mar 2021 02:46:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-26"}

These may\narise from a bottom-up aggregation of structures or in a top-down frame; their\nquasi-equilibrium properties are well described by the Jeans equation and are\nnot universal, i.e. they depend on initial conditions. To understand the origin\nof such dependence, we present results of numerical experiments of initially\ncold and spherical systems characterized by various choices of the spectrum of\ninitial density fluctuations. The amplitude of such fluctuations determines\nwhether the system relaxes in a top-down or a bottom-up manner. We find that\nstatistical properties of the resulting QSS mainly depend upon the amount of\nenergy exchanged during the formation process. In particular, in the violent\ntop-down collapses the energy exchange is large and the QSS show an inner core\nwith an almost flat density profile and a quasi Maxwell-Boltzmann (isotropic)\nvelocity distribution, while their outer regions display a density profile\n$\\rho(r) \\propto r^{-\\alpha}$ ($\\alpha >0$) with radially elongated orbits.

These methods are, at least, two orders\nof magnitude faster than conventional DFT, only require modest central memory,\nand in this paper we aim to benchmark their accuracy against rigorous and\nresource hungry quantum mechanical methods. We focused on 38 water structures\nstudied by MP2 and CCSD(T) approaches comparing energetic and structures with\nthree levels of GFN-xTB parametrization (GFN0, GFN1, GFN2) methods. The\nextremely good results obtained at the very cheap GFN-xTB level for both water\ncluster structures and energetic paved the way towards the modeling of very\nlarge AWS models of astrochemical interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Sep 2020 12:36:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-25"}

Under\nsuitable regularity assumptions on the coefficients, an autonomous\ncharacterization is obtained for the marginal distribution of the dynamics of\nthe neighborhood of a typical node in terms of a certain local equation, which\nis a new kind of SDE that is nonlinear in the sense of McKean. This equation\ndescribes a finite-dimensional non-Markovian stochastic process whose evolution\nat any time depends not only on the structure and current state of the\nneighborhood, but also on the conditional law of the current state given the\npast of the states of neighborhing nodes. Such marginal distributions are of\ninterest because they arise as weak limits of both marginal distributions and\nempirical measures of interacting diffusions on many sequences of sparse random\ngraphs, including the configuration model and Erdos-Renyi graphs whose average\ndegrees converge to a finite non-zero limit. The results obtained complement\nclassical results in the mean-field regime, which characterize the limiting\ndynamics of homogeneous interacting diffusions on complete graphs, as the\nnumber of nodes goes to infinity, in terms of a corresponding nonlinear Markov\nprocess. However, in the sparse graph setting, the topology of the graph\nstrongly influences the dynamics, and the analysis requires a completely\ndifferent approach.

This polytope arises, for instance, in pooling problems with\nfixed proportions of the inputs at each pool. We show that it inherits many\ncharacteristics from BQP, among them a wide range of facet classes and\noperations which are facet preserving. Moreover, we characterize various cases\nin which the polytope is completely described via the relaxation-linearization\ninequalities. The special structure induced by the additional multiple-choice\nconstraints also allows for new facet-preserving symmetries as well as lifting\noperations.

However, instead of these\nchanges of the O$_3$ formation region, the significant elevated O$_3$ in the\nNorth China Plain (40%) and Yangtze River Delta (35%) were mainly attributed to\nthe enhanced atmospheric oxidant capacity (AOC) in these regions, which was\ndifferent from previous studies.

For\nplanets up to a few Jupiter masses, eccentric orbits are thought to be the\noutcome of planet-planet scattering events taking place after gas dispersal. We\nsimulate the growth of planets via pebble and gas accretion as well as the\nmigration of multiple planetary embryos in their gas disc. We then follow the\nlong-term dynamical evolution of our formed planetary system up to 100 Myr\nafter gas disc dispersal. We investigate the importance of the initial number\nof protoplanetary embryos and different damping rates of eccentricity and\ninclination during the gas phase for the final configuration of our planetary\nsystems. We constrain our model by comparing the final dynamical structure of\nour simulated planetary systems to that of observed exoplanet systems. Our\nresults show that the initial number of planetary embryos has only a minor\nimpact on the final orbital eccentricity distribution of the giant planets, as\nlong as damping of eccentricity and inclination is efficient. If damping is\ninefficient (slow), systems with a larger initial number of embryos harbor\nlarger average eccentricities. In addition, for slow damping rates, we observe\nthat scattering events already during the gas disc phase are common and that\nthe giant planets formed in these simulations match the observed giant planet\neccentricity distribution best. These simulations also show that massive giant\nplanets (above Jupiter mass) on eccentric orbits are less likely to host inner\nsuper-Earths as these get lost during the scattering phase, while systems with\nless massive giant planets on nearly circular orbits should harbor systems of\ninner super-Earths.

Resorting to methods from Evolutionary Game Theory (EGT),\nhere we analyse how prior commitments can also be adopted as a tool for\nenhancing coordination when its outcomes exhibit an asymmetric payoff\nstructure, in both pairwise and multiparty interactions. Arguably, coordination\nis more complex to achieve than cooperation since there might be several\ndesirable collective outcomes in a coordination problem (compared to mutual\ncooperation, the only desirable collective outcome in cooperation dilemmas).\nOur analysis, both analytically and via numerical simulations, shows that\nwhether prior commitment would be a viable evolutionary mechanism for enhancing\ncoordination and the overall population social welfare strongly depends on the\ncollective benefit and severity of competition, and more importantly, how\nasymmetric benefits are resolved in a commitment deal. Moreover, in multiparty\ninteractions, prior commitments prove to be crucial when a high level of group\ndiversity is required for optimal coordination. The results are robust for\ndifferent selection intensities.

Currently, there is an active search for\nsuitable nonlinear material systems with efficient conversion and small\nmaterial footprint. Ideally, the material system should allow for\nchip-integration and room-temperature operation. Two-dimensional materials are\nhighly interesting in this regard. Particularly promising is graphene, which\nhas demonstrated an exceptionally large nonlinearity in the terahertz regime.\nYet, the light-matter interaction length in two-dimensional materials is\ninherently minimal, thus limiting the overall nonlinear-optical conversion\nefficiency. Here we overcome this challenge using a metamaterial platform that\ncombines graphene with a photonic grating structure providing field\nenhancement. We measure terahertz third-harmonic generation in this\nmetamaterial and obtain an effective third-order nonlinear susceptibility with\na magnitude as large as 3$\\cdot$10$^{-8}$m$^2$/V$^2$, or 21 esu, for a\nfundamental frequency of 0.7 THz. This nonlinearity is 50 times larger than\nwhat we obtain for graphene without grating. Such an enhancement corresponds to\nthird-harmonic signal with an intensity that is three orders of magnitude\nlarger due to the grating. Moreover, we demonstrate a field conversion\nefficiency for the third harmonic of up to $\\sim$1% using a moderate field\nstrength of $\\sim$30 kV/cm. Finally we show that harmonics beyond the third are\nenhanced even more strongly, allowing us to observe signatures of up to the\n9$^{\\rm th}$ harmonic.

The unstable trajectory segments' actions are expanded\ninto linear combinations of homoclinic orbit actions that shadow them in a\npiece-wise fashion.

An alternative point of\nview is also proposed which partitions the trajectories into short segments of\ntransient visits to the neighborhoods of successive periodic orbits, giving\nrise to a periodic orbit expansion scheme which is equivalent to the homoclinic\norbit expansion. This clearly demonstrates that homoclinic and periodic orbits\nare equally valid skeletal structures for the tessellation of phase-space\ndynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Sep 2020 13:57:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-28"}

First, the existence of edge classes often makes\nthe total mean biased in the calculation of between-class scatter matrix.\nSecond, the exploitation of l2-norm based between-class distance criterion\nmagnifies the extremely large distance corresponding to edge class.

We introduce a\nnovel deep sparse autoregressive model (SARM) that explicitly learns the\nsparseness of the data with a tractable likelihood, making it more stable and\ninterpretable when compared to Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and other\nmethods. In two case studies, we compare SARM to a GAN model and a non-sparse\nautoregressive model. As a quantitative measure of performance, we compute the\nWasserstein distance ($W_p$) between the distributions of physical quantities\ncalculated on the generated images and on the training images. In the first\nstudy, featuring images of jets in which 90% of the pixels are zero-valued,\nSARM produces images with $W_p$ scores that are 24-52% better than the scores\nobtained with other state-of-the-art generative models. In the second study, on\ncalorimeter images in the vicinity of muons where 98% of the pixels are\nzero-valued, SARM produces images with $W_p$ scores that are 66-68% better.\nSimilar observations made with other metrics confirm the usefulness of SARM for\nsparse data in particle physics.

In this work we address\nthe special problem of computationally grouping mass channel images according\nto their similarities in their lateral distribution patterns. Such an analysis\nis driven by the idea, that groups of molecules that feature a similar\ndistribution pattern may have a functional relation. But the selection of the\nsimilarity function and other parameters is often done by a time-consuming and\nunsatsifactory trial and error. We propose a new flexible workflow scheme\ncalled SoRC (sum of ranked cluster indices) for automating this tuning step and\nmaking it much more efficient. We test SoRC using three different data sets\nacquired from the lab for three different kinds of samples (barley seed, mouse\nbladder tissue, human PXE skin). We show, that SORC can be applied to score and\nvisualize the results obtained with the applied methods in short time without\ntoo much effort. In our application example, the SoRC results for the three\ndata sets reveal that a) some well-known similarity functions are suited to\nachieve good results for all three data sets and b) for the MSI data featuring\na higher degree of irregularity improved results can be achieved by applying\nnon-standard similarity functions. The SoRC scores computed with our approach\nindicate that an automated testing and scoring of different methods for mass\nchannel image grouping can improve the final outcome of a study by finally\nselecting the methods of the highest scores.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Sep 2020 10:24:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-01"}

It\nhas recently been shown that ultrafast ultrasound imaging can be used to record\nand analyze the mechanical response of individual MUs using blind source\nseparation. In this work, we present an alternative method - a deep learning\npipeline - to identify active MUs in ultrasound image sequences, including\nsegmentation of their territories and signal estimation of their mechanical\nresponses (twitch train). We train and evaluate the model using simulated data\nmimicking the complex activation pattern of tens of activated MUs with\noverlapping territories and partially synchronized activation patterns. Using a\nslow fusion approach (based on 3D CNNs), we transform the spatiotemporal image\nsequence data to 2D representations and apply a deep neural network\narchitecture for segmentation. Next, we employ a second deep neural network\narchitecture for signal estimation. The results show that the proposed pipeline\ncan effectively identify individual MUs, estimate their territories, and\nestimate their twitch train signal at low contraction forces. The framework can\nretain spatio-temporal consistencies and information of the mechanical response\nof MU activity even when the ultrasound image sequences are transformed into a\n2D representation for compatibility with more traditional computer vision and\nimage processing techniques. The proposed pipeline is potentially useful to\nidentify simultaneously active MUs in whole muscles in ultrasound image\nsequences of voluntary skeletal muscle contractions at low force levels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 2020 20:44:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-08"}

Bias\nin such ranking systems, especially among the top ranks, can worsen social and\neconomic inequalities, polarize opinions, and reinforce stereotypes. On the\nother hand, a bias correction for minority groups can cause more harm if\nperceived as favoring group-fair outcomes over meritocracy. In this paper, we\nformulate the problem of underranking in group-fair rankings, which was not\naddressed in previous work. Most group-fair ranking algorithms post-process a\ngiven ranking and output a group-fair ranking. We define underranking based on\nhow close the group-fair rank of each item is to its original rank, and prove a\nlower bound on the trade-off achievable for simultaneous underranking and group\nfairness in ranking. We give a fair ranking algorithm that takes any given\nranking and outputs another ranking with simultaneous underranking and group\nfairness guarantees comparable to the lower bound we prove. Our algorithm works\nwith group fairness constraints for any number of groups. Our experimental\nresults confirm the theoretical trade-off between underranking and group\nfairness, and also show that our algorithm achieves the best of both when\ncompared to the state-of-the-art baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Sep 2020 14:56:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Feb 2021 17:20:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-19"}

These models, in turn, rely on multiple model parameters,\nwhich are determined through experiments or small-scale simulations and contain\na certain level of uncertainty. The competing effects of transport, particle\nphysics, and chemistry give rise to various scales and disparate dynamics,\nmaking it a very challenging problem to analyse. Therefore, the steady\ncombustion process of a single solid particle is considered as a starting point\nfor this study. As an added complication, the large number of parameters\npresent in such simulations makes a purely forward approach to sensitivity\nanalysis very expensive and almost infeasible. Therefore, the use of\nadjoint-based algorithms, to identify and quantify the underlying sensitivities\nand uncertainties, is proposed. This adjoint framework bears a great advantage\nin this case, where a large input space is analysed, since a single forward and\nbackward sweep provides sensitivity information with respect to all parameters\nof interest. In order to investigate the applicability of such methods, both\ndiscrete and continuous adjoints are considered, and compared to the\nconventional approaches, such as finite differences, and forward sensitivity\nanalysis. Various quantities of interest are considered, and sensitivities with\nrespect to the relevant combustion parameters are reported for two different\nfreestream compositions, describing air and oxy-atmospheres.
