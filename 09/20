Simulating online\nrecommender system performance is notoriously difficult and the discrepancy\nbetween online and offline behaviors is typically not accounted for in offline\nevaluations. This disparity permits weaknesses to go unnoticed until the model\nis deployed in a production setting. In this paper, we first demonstrate how\nomitting temporal context when evaluating recommender system performance leads\nto false confidence. To overcome this, we postulate that offline evaluation\nprotocols can only model real-life use-cases if they account for temporal\ncontext. Next, we propose a training procedure to further embed the temporal\ncontext in existing models. We use a multi-objective approach to introduce\ntemporal context into traditionally time-unaware recommender systems and\nconfirm its advantage via the proposed evaluation protocol. Finally, we\nvalidate that the Pareto Fronts obtained with the added objective dominate\nthose produced by state-of-the-art models that are only optimized for accuracy\non three real-world publicly available datasets. The results show that\nincluding our temporal objective can improve recall@20 by up to 20%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Sep 2020 19:36:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Aug 2021 16:13:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 5 Sep 2021 16:06:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-07"}

However, most existing CKG\ncompletion methods focus on the setting where all the entities are presented at\ntraining time. Although this setting is standard for conventional KG\ncompletion, it has limitations for CKG completion. At test time, entities in\nCKGs can be unseen because they may have unseen text/names and entities may be\ndisconnected from the training graph, since CKGs are generally very sparse.\nHere, we propose to study the inductive learning setting for CKG completion\nwhere unseen entities may present at test time. We develop a novel learning\nframework named InductivE. Different from previous approaches, InductiveE\nensures the inductive learning capability by directly computing entity\nembeddings from raw entity attributes/text. InductiveE consists of a free-text\nencoder, a graph encoder, and a KG completion decoder. Specifically, the\nfree-text encoder first extracts the textual representation of each entity\nbased on the pre-trained language model and word embedding. The graph encoder\nis a gated relational graph convolutional neural network that learns from a\ndensified graph for more informative entity representation learning. We develop\na method that densifies CKGs by adding edges among semantic-related entities\nand provide more supportive information for unseen entities, leading to better\ngeneralization ability of entity embedding for unseen entities. Finally,\ninductiveE employs Conv-TransE as the CKG completion decoder. Experimental\nresults show that InductiveE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art\nbaselines in both standard and inductive settings on ATOMIC and ConceptNet\nbenchmarks. InductivE performs especially well on inductive scenarios where it\nachieves above 48% improvement over present methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Sep 2020 16:10:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2021 19:48:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-19"}

However, experimentally measuring all the\nnecessary electronic interaction cross-sections for every relevant material is\nan arduous task, so it is necessary having predictive models, sufficiently\naccurate yet easily implementable. In this work we present a model, based on\nthe dielectric formalism, to provide reliable ionisation and excitation\ncross-sections for electron-impact on complex biomolecular media, taking into\naccount their condensed-phase nature. We account for the indistinguishability\nand exchange between the primary beam and excited electrons, for the molecular\nelectronic structure effects in the electron binding, as well as for\nhigher-order corrections to the first Born approximation. The resulting\napproach yields total ionisation cross-sections, energy distributions of\nsecondary electrons, and total electronic excitation cross-sections for\ncondensed-phase biomaterials, once the electronic excitation spectrum is known,\neither from experiments or from a predictive model. The results of this\nmethodology are compared with the available experimental data in water and\nDNA/RNA molecular building blocks, showing a very good agreement and a great\npredictive power in a wide range of electron incident energies, from the large\nvalues characteristic of electron beams down to excitation threshold.

In this work, we study several compression schemes and\nidentify how three key parameters affect the performance. We also provide a set\nof insights on how to increase performance and introduce a simple\nsparsification scheme, random-block sparsification, that reduces communication\nwhile keeping the performance close to standard SGD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Sep 2020 17:28:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-22"}

Partial domain\nadaptation addresses the scenario when target categories are only a subset of\nsource categories. In this paper, to enable the efficient representation of\ncross-domain plant images, we first extract deep features from pre-trained\nmodels and then develop adversarial consistent learning ($ACL$) in a unified\ndeep architecture for partial domain adaptation. It consists of source domain\nclassification loss, adversarial learning loss, and feature consistency loss.\nAdversarial learning loss can maintain domain-invariant features between the\nsource and target domains.

This is because the synaptic storage resources on a tile, viz. a\ncrossbar, can accommodate only a fixed number of pre-synaptic connections per\npost-synaptic neuron. For complex SNN models that have many pre-synaptic\nconnections per neuron, some connections may need to be pruned after training\nto fit onto the tile resources, leading to a loss in model quality, e.g.,\naccuracy. In this work, we propose a novel unrolling technique that decomposes\na neuron function with many pre-synaptic connections into a sequence of\nhomogeneous neural units, where each neural unit is a function computation\nnode, with two pre-synaptic connections. This spatial decomposition technique\nsignificantly improves crossbar utilization and retains all pre-synaptic\nconnections, resulting in no loss of the model quality derived from connection\npruning. We integrate the proposed technique within an existing SNN mapping\nframework and evaluate it using machine learning applications on the DYNAP-SE\nstate-of-the-art neuromorphic hardware.

Localization algorithms\noften take advantage of maps for estimating the car pose. Since maintaining and\nusing several maps is computationally expensive, it is important to analyze\nwhich type of map is more adequate for each application. In this work, we\nprovide data for such analysis by comparing the accuracy of a particle filter\nlocalization when using occupancy, reflectivity, color, or semantic grid maps.\nTo the best of our knowledge, such evaluation is missing in the literature. For\nbuilding semantic and colour grid maps, point clouds from a Light Detection and\nRanging (LiDAR) sensor are fused with images captured by a front-facing camera.\nSemantic information is extracted from images with a deep neural network.\nExperiments are performed in varied environments, under diverse conditions of\nillumination and traffic. Results show that occupancy grid maps lead to more\naccurate localization, followed by reflectivity grid maps. In most scenarios,\nthe localization with semantic grid maps kept the position tracking without\ncatastrophic losses, but with errors from 2 to 3 times bigger than the\nprevious. Colour grid maps led to inaccurate and unstable localization even\nusing a robust metric, the entropy correlation coefficient, for comparing\nonline data and the map.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Sep 2020 22:02:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-22"}

This principle was defined and popularized by the\ninfluential 'connectivity map' study in 2006 regarding reversal relationships\nbetween disease- and drug-induced gene expression profiles, quantified by a\ndisease-drug 'connectivity score.' Over the past 15 years, several studies have\nproposed variations in calculating connectivity scores towards improving\naccuracy and robustness in light of massive growth in reference drug profiles.\nHowever, these variations have been formulated inconsistently using various\nnotations and terminologies even though they are based on a common set of\nconceptual and statistical ideas. Therefore, we present a systematic\nreconciliation of multiple disease-drug similarity metrics (ES, css, Sum,\nCosine, XSum, XCor, XSpe, XCos, EWCos) and connectivity scores (CS, RGES, NCS,\nWCS, Tau, CSS, EMUDRA) by defining them using consistent notation and\nterminology.

Here we propose that the formation of such binaries is possible through\ngas accretion onto the BH remnants of Population III (Pop~III) stars born in\nhigh-redshift ($z>10$) minihalos. Once the parent halo has grown to the\natomic-cooling limit, even brief episodes of gas accretion in the dense central\nregions of the halo can increase the masses of Pop~III remnant BHs above the PI\nlimit. Starting with a BBH with an initial mass of O(100) ${\\rm M_{\\odot}}$ we\nfind that it would only need to spend about 100~Myr in the inner few pc of an\natomic-cooling halo to accrete about 50~${\\rm M_{\\odot}}$ of material and\nresemble a system similar to GW190521. The dynamical friction timescale for the\nbinary to sink to the dense inner region of its parent halo is comparable or\nshorter than the accretion timescale required to increase their mass above the\nPI limit. Once in the core of the halo, the binary can enter a phase of\nhyper-Eddington accretion, where it would only take a few thousand years to\nexceed the PI limit through accretion. Even more massive BBHs could form\nthrough this channel, and be detectable by detectors with improved\nlow-frequency sensitivity. Single Pop~III BH remnants would also grow through\naccretion and could later form binaries dynamically.

The lack of\nempirical data and complex causal and outcome relationships make it difficult\nto estimate the degree to which certain risk types are exposed. Traditional\nrisk models are based on classical set theory. In comparison, fuzzy logic\nmodels are built on fuzzy set theory and are useful for analyzing risks with\ninsufficient knowledge or inaccurate data. Fuzzy logic systems help to make\nlarge-scale risk management frameworks more simple. For risks that do not have\nan appropriate probability model, a fuzzy logic system can help model the cause\nand effect relationships, assess the level of risk exposure, rank key risks in\na consistent way, and consider available data and experts'opinions. Besides, in\nfuzzy logic systems, some rules explicitly explain the connection, dependence,\nand relationships between model factors. This can help identify risk mitigation\nsolutions. Resources can be used to mitigate risks with very high levels of\nexposure and relatively low hedging costs. Fuzzy set and fuzzy logic models can\nbe used with Bayesian and other types of method recognition and decision\nmodels, including artificial neural networks and decision tree models.

Most approaches to this problem\nhandle the agents as point objects, wherein the size of the agent is\nsignificantly smaller than the road on which it travels. In this paper, we\nconsider spatially extended agents which have a size comparable to the length\nof the road on which they travel. An optimal multi agent path finding approach\nfor spatially-extended agents was proposed in the eXtended Conflict Based\nSearch (XCBS) algorithm. As XCBS resolves only a pair of conflicts at a time,\nit results in deeper search trees in case of cascading or multiple (more than\ntwo agent) conflicts at a given location. This issue is addressed in eXtended\nConflict Based Search with Awareness (XCBS-A) in which an agent uses awareness\nof other agents' plans to make its own plan. In this paper, we explore XCBS-A\nin greater detail, we theoretically prove its completeness and empirically\ndemonstrate its performance with other algorithms in terms of variances in road\ncharacteristics, agent characteristics and plan characteristics. We demonstrate\nthe distributive nature of the algorithm by evaluating its performance when\ndistributed over multiple machines.

In decentralized\nmulti-agent control, systems are complex with unknown or highly uncertain\ndynamics, where traditional model-based control methods can hardly be applied.\nCompared with model-based control in control theory, deep reinforcement\nlearning (DRL) is promising to learn the controller/policy from data without\nthe knowing system dynamics. However, to directly apply DRL to decentralized\nmulti-agent control is challenging, as interactions among agents make the\nlearning environment non-stationary. More importantly, the existing multi-agent\nreinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms cannot ensure the closed-loop\nstability of a multi-agent system from a control-theoretic perspective, so the\nlearned control polices are highly possible to generate abnormal or dangerous\nbehaviors in real applications.

Remarkably, this antibacterial activity is\ntwo orders of magnitude greater than the activity of its surrounding copper\nions. We demonstrate that the rGO is functionalized through the cation-${\\pi}$\ninteraction to massively adsorb copper ions to form a rGO-copper composite in\nsolution and result in an extremely low concentration level of surrounding\ncopper ions (less than ~0.5 ${\\mu}M$). These copper ions on rGO are positively\ncharged and strongly interact with negatively charged bacterial cells to\nselectively achieve antibacterial activity, while rGO exhibits the\nfunctionality to not only actuate rapid delivery of copper ions and massive\nassembly onto bacterial cells but also result in the valence shift in the\ncopper ions from Cu$^{2+}$ into Cu$^{+}$ which greatly enhances the\nantibacterial activity.

AGRO (the Agile Ground\nRobot) is a 4WIDS inspection robot that can be deployed into unsafe\nenvironments by being thrown, and can use the reaction torque from its four\nwheels to command its orientation while in the air. Prior work has demonstrated\non a hardware prototype that simple PD control with hand-tuned gains is\nsufficient, but hardly optimal, to stabilize the orientation in under 500ms.\nThe goal of this work is to decrease the stabilization time and reject\ndisturbances using nonlinear control methods. A model-based Feedback\nLinearization (FL) was added to compensate for the nonlinear Coriolis terms.\nHowever, with external disturbances, model uncertainty and sensor noise, the FL\ncontroller does not guarantee stability. As an alternative, a second controller\nwas developed using backstepping methods with an adaptive compensator for\nexternal disturbances, model uncertainty, and sensor offset. The controller was\ndesigned using Lyapunov analysis. A simulation was written using the full\nnonlinear dynamics of AGRO in an isotropic steering configuration in which\ncontrol authority over its pitch and roll are equalized.

Here, we address the steady-state transport of pseudothermal photons\nbetween two waveguides connected through a cavity with Bose-Hubbard interaction\nbetween photons. One of the waveguides is subjected to a broadband incoherent\npumping. We predict a continuous transition between the regimes of Lorentzian\nand Gaussian chaotic light emitted by the cavity. The rich variety of\nnonequilibrium transport regimes is revealed by the zero-frequency noise. There\nare three limiting cases, in which the noise-current relation is characterized\nby a power-law, $S\\propto J^\\gamma$.

Dealing with dynamic\nand everlasting problems poses new challenges for which traditional batch-based\noffline algorithms turn out to be insufficient in terms of computational time\nand predictive performance. One of the most crucial limitations is that we\ncannot assume having access to a finite and complete data set - we always have\nto be ready for new data that may complement our model. This poses a critical\nproblem of providing labels for potentially unbounded streams. In the real\nworld, we are forced to deal with very strict budget limitations, therefore, we\nwill most likely face the scarcity of annotated instances, which are essential\nin supervised learning. In our work, we emphasize this problem and propose a\nnovel instance exploitation technique. We show that when: (i) data is\ncharacterized by temporary non-stationary concepts, and (ii) there are very few\nlabels spanned across a long time horizon, it is actually better to risk\noverfitting and adapt models more aggressively by exploiting the only labeled\ninstances we have, instead of sticking to a standard learning mode and\nsuffering from severe underfitting.

Here, we adapt this\napproach to index visual semantics in images of scenes. To this end, we\nformulate a distributional hypothesis for objects and scenes: Scenes that\ncontain the same objects (object context) are semantically related. Similarly,\nobjects that appear in the same spatial context (within a scene or subregions\nof a scene) are semantically related. We develop two approaches for learning\nobject and scene embeddings from annotated images. In the first approach, we\nadapt LSA and Word2vec's Skipgram and CBOW models to generate two sets of\nembeddings from object co-occurrences in whole images, one for objects and one\nfor scenes.

Its key first\nstep is to desire learning a representation coefficient matrix with block\ndiagonal structure. To realize this step, many methods were successively\nproposed by imposing different structure priors on the coefficient matrix.\nThese impositions can be roughly divided into two categories, i.e., indirect\nand direct. The former introduces the priors such as sparsity and low rankness\nto indirectly or implicitly learn the block diagonal structure. However, the\ndesired block diagonalty cannot necessarily be guaranteed for noisy data. While\nthe latter directly or explicitly imposes the block diagonal structure prior\nsuch as block diagonal representation (BDR) to ensure so-desired block\ndiagonalty even if the data is noisy but at the expense of losing the convexity\nthat the former's objective possesses. For compensating their respective\nshortcomings, in this paper, we follow the direct line to propose Adaptive\nBlock Diagonal Representation (ABDR) which explicitly pursues block diagonalty\nwithout sacrificing the convexity of the indirect one. Specifically, inspired\nby Convex BiClustering, ABDR coercively fuses both columns and rows of the\ncoefficient matrix via a specially designed convex regularizer, thus naturally\nenjoying their merits and adaptively obtaining the number of blocks. Finally,\nexperimental results on synthetic and real benchmarks demonstrate the\nsuperiority of ABDR to the state-of-the-arts (SOTAs).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Sep 2020 08:31:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Sep 2020 13:10:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 9 May 2022 03:56:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-10"}

To reduce the\ncomplexity of the implementation, an adaptive log-likelihood ratio (LLR)\nquantization scheme is used.

Nevertheless, HFR is confronted\nwith challenges from large domain discrepancy and insufficient heterogeneous\ndata. In this paper, we formulate HFR as a dual generation problem, and tackle\nit via a novel Dual Variational Generation (DVG-Face) framework. Specifically,\na dual variational generator is elaborately designed to learn the joint\ndistribution of paired heterogeneous images. However, the small-scale paired\nheterogeneous training data may limit the identity diversity of sampling. In\norder to break through the limitation, we propose to integrate abundant\nidentity information of large-scale visible data into the joint distribution.\nFurthermore, a pairwise identity preserving loss is imposed on the generated\npaired heterogeneous images to ensure their identity consistency. As a\nconsequence, massive new diverse paired heterogeneous images with the same\nidentity can be generated from noises. The identity consistency and identity\ndiversity properties allow us to employ these generated images to train the HFR\nnetwork via a contrastive learning mechanism, yielding both domain-invariant\nand discriminative embedding features. Concretely, the generated paired\nheterogeneous images are regarded as positive pairs, and the images obtained\nfrom different samplings are considered as negative pairs.

As a simple yet effective remedy, we propose two\nnovel methods, F^2-Softmax and MefMax, for a balanced training even with the\nskewed frequency distribution. MefMax assigns tokens uniquely to frequency\nclasses, trying to group tokens with similar frequencies and equalize frequency\nmass between the classes. F^2-Softmax then decomposes a probability\ndistribution of the target token into a product of two conditional\nprobabilities of (i) frequency class, and (ii) token from the target frequency\nclass.

This problem, known\nas spatial confounding, is encountered modelling forestry data to assess the\neffect of temperature on tree health. Reliable inference is difficult as\nresults depend on whether or not spatial effects are included in the model. The\nmechanism behind spatial confounding is poorly understood and methods for\ndealing with it are limited. We propose a novel approach, spatial+, in which\ncollinearity is reduced by replacing the covariates in the spatial model by\ntheir residuals after spatial dependence has been regressed away. Using a thin\nplate spline model formulation, we recognise spatial confounding as a\nsmoothing-induced bias identified by Rice (1986), and through asymptotic\nanalysis of the effect estimates, we show that spatial+ avoids the bias\nproblems of the spatial model. This is also demonstrated in a simulation study.\nSpatial+ is straight-forward to implement using existing software and, as the\nresponse variable is the same as that of the spatial model, standard model\nselection criteria can be used for comparisons. A major advantage of the method\nis also that it extends to models with non-Gaussian response distributions.\nFinally, while our results are derived in a thin plate spline setting, the\nspatial+ methodology transfers easily to other spatial model formulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Sep 2020 12:11:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-22"}

The models predict a\nwider diversity of possible atmospheres than those predicted using elemental\nratios from snowlines only.

However, current works utilize RNN/LSTM to\nimplicitly capture sequential region/label dependencies, which cannot fully\nexplore mutual interactions among the semantic regions/labels and do not\nexplicitly integrate label co-occurrences. In addition, these works require\nlarge amounts of training samples for each category, and they are unable to\ngeneralize to novel categories with limited samples. To address these issues,\nwe propose a knowledge-guided graph routing (KGGR) framework, which unifies\nprior knowledge of statistical label correlations with deep neural networks.\nThe framework exploits prior knowledge to guide adaptive information\npropagation among different categories to facilitate multi-label analysis and\nreduce the dependency of training samples. Specifically, it first builds a\nstructured knowledge graph to correlate different labels based on statistical\nlabel co-occurrence. Then, it introduces the label semantics to guide learning\nsemantic-specific features to initialize the graph, and it exploits a graph\npropagation network to explore graph node interactions, enabling learning\ncontextualized image feature representations. Moreover, we initialize each\ngraph node with the classifier weights for the corresponding label and apply\nanother propagation network to transfer node messages through the graph. In\nthis way, it can facilitate exploiting the information of correlated labels to\nhelp train better classifiers. We conduct extensive experiments on the\ntraditional multi-label image recognition (MLR) and multi-label few-shot\nlearning (ML-FSL) tasks and show that our KGGR framework outperforms the\ncurrent state-of-the-art methods by sizable margins on the public benchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Sep 2020 15:05:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-22"}

Since the meaning of data utility in\ndifferent applications may vastly differ, a key challenge is to find the\noptimal randomization mechanism, i.e., the distribution and its parameters, for\na given utility metric. Existing works have identified the optimal\ndistributions in some special cases, while leaving all other utility metrics\n(e.g., usefulness and graph distance) as open problems. Since existing works\nmostly rely on manual analysis to examine the search space of all\ndistributions, it would be an expensive process to repeat such efforts for each\nutility metric. To address such deficiency, we propose a novel approach that\ncan automatically optimize different utility metrics found in diverse\napplications under a common framework. Our key idea that, by regarding the\nvariance of the injected noise itself as a random variable, a two-fold\ndistribution may approximately cover the search space of all distributions.\nTherefore, we can automatically find distributions in this search space to\noptimize different utility metrics in a similar manner, simply by optimizing\nthe parameters of the two-fold distribution. Specifically, we define a\nuniversal framework, namely, randomizing the randomization mechanism of\ndifferential privacy (R$^2$DP), and we formally analyze its privacy and\nutility. Our experiments show that R$^2$DP can provide better results than the\nbaseline distribution (Laplace) for several utility metrics with no known\noptimal distributions, whereas our results asymptotically approach to the\noptimality for utility metrics having known optimal distributions. As a side\nbenefit, the added degree of freedom introduced by the two-fold distribution\nallows R$^2$DP to accommodate the preferences of both data owners and\nrecipients.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Sep 2020 15:06:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Sep 2020 04:30:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-25"}

To address this challenge, we\ncombine thermodynamic analysis of the Pr-Ir-O2 system with experimental results\nfrom the conventional physical vapor deposition (PVD) technique of\nco-sputtering. Our results indicate that only high growth temperatures yield\nfilms with crystallinity sufficient for utilizing and tailoring the desired\ntopological electronic properties. Thermodynamic calculations indicate that\nhigh deposition temperatures and high partial pressures of gas species O2(g)\nand IrO3(g), are required to stabilize Pr2Ir2O7. We further find that the gas\nspecies partial pressure requirements are beyond that achievable by any\nconventional PVD technique. We experimentally show that conventional PVD growth\nparameters produce exclusively Pr3IrO7, which conclusion we reproduce with\ntheoretical calculations. Our findings provide solid evidence that in situ\nsynthesis of Pr2Ir2O7 thin films is fettered by the inability to grow with\noxygen partial pressure on the order of 10 Torr, a limitation inherent to the\nPVD process.

A massive MIMO-NOMA system can deliver remarkable\nspectral improvements and low communication latency. Nevertheless, the\nuncontrollable stochastic behavior of the wireless channels can still degrade\nits performance. In this context, intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has\narisen as a promising technology for smartly overcoming the harmful effects of\nthe wireless environment. The disruptive IRS concept of controlling the\npropagation channels via software can provide attractive performance gains to\nthe communication networks, including higher data rates, improved user\nfairness, and, possibly, higher energy efficiency. In this article, in contrast\nto the existing literature, we demonstrate the main roles of IRSs in MIMO-NOMA\nsystems. Specifically, we identify and perform a comprehensive discussion of\nthe main performance gains that can be achieved in IRS-assisted massive\nMIMO-NOMA (IRS-NOMA) networks. We outline exciting futuristic use case\nscenarios for IRS-NOMA and expose the main related challenges and future\nresearch directions.
