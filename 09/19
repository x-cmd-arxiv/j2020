Although in CuIr2S4 the ODL state comprises one orbital per\nIr, there is no fundamental reason to exclude multi-orbital ODL states in\ngeneral. The MgTi2O4 spinel exhibits a MIT on cooling at Ts ~250 K, accompanied\nby Ti t2g orbital ordering (OO) and spin dimerization with the average symmetry\nreducing to tetragonal. It shares with CuIr2S4 the pyrochlore transition metal\nsublattice with active t2g orbitals. This, together with its different orbital\nfilling (t2g1 vs t2g5.5) make it a candidate for hosting a multi-orbital ODL\nprecursor state. By combining x-ray and neutron pair distribution function\nanalyses to track the evolution of the local atomic structure across the MIT we\nfind that local tetragonality already exists in the metallic globally cubic\nphase at high temperature. Local distortions exist up to at least 500 K.\nSignificantly, the high temperature local state is not continuously connected\nto the OO band insulator ground state, and so the transition cannot be\ncharacterized as a trivial order-disorder type. The shortest Ti-Ti spin singlet\ndimer bonds expand abruptly on warming across the transition but remain shorter\nthan those seen in the cubic structure.

Specifically, we i)\noffer a complete view of the most prominent neural-based techniques relevant to\nintrusion detection, including deep-based approaches or weightless neural\nnetworks, which feature surprising outcomes; ii) evaluate novel datasets\n(updated w.r.t. the obsolete KDD99 set) through a designed-from-scratch\nPython-based routine; iii) perform experimental analyses including time\ncomplexity and performance (accuracy and F-measure), considering both\nsingle-class and multi-class problems, and identifying trade-offs between\nresource consumption and performance. Our evaluation quantifies the value of\nneural networks, particularly when state-of-the-art datasets are used to train\nthe models. This leads to interesting guidelines for security managers and\ncomputer network practitioners who are looking at the incorporation of\nneural-based ML into IDS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Sep 2020 18:32:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-22"}

However, our experience leads us to believe that, in the\ngrand scheme of things, these software vulnerabilities may have less impact\nthan what is reported. Therefore, we perform a study to better understand the\nthreat of npm vulnerable packages used in Node.js applications. We define three\nthreat levels for vulnerabilities in packages, based on their lifecycle, where\na package vulnerability is assigned a low threat level if it was hidden or\nstill unknown at the time it was used in the dependent application (t), medium\nthreat level if the vulnerability was reported but not yet published at t, and\nhigh if it was publicly announced at t. Then, we perform an empirical study\ninvolving 6,673 real-world, active, and mature open source Node.js\napplications.

Moreover, we find that in the case of vulnerable packages classified as\nhaving high threat, it is the application's lack of updating that makes them\nvulnerable, i.e., it is not the existence of the vulnerability that is the real\nproblem.

Although our algorithm can be applied\nto any plant genotypes, we test it on the phenotypic data obtained from about\n2400 Soybean genotypes. SC with Pivotal Sampling achieves substantially more\naccuracy (in terms of Silhouette Values) than all the other proposed\ncompetitive clustering with sampling algorithms (i.e. SC with VQ, HC with\nPivotal Sampling, and HC with VQ). The complexities of our SC with Pivotal\nSampling algorithm and these three variants are almost same because of the\ninvolved sampling. In addition to this, SC with Pivotal Sampling outperforms\nthe standard HC algorithm in both accuracy and computational complexity. We\nexperimentally show that we are up to 45% more accurate than HC in terms of\nclustering accuracy. The computational complexity of our algorithm is more than\na magnitude lesser than HC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Sep 2020 18:59:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-22"}

Many subdwarfs show rich oscillations and are\namong the most chemically peculiar stars known. Two intermediate He-rich hot\nsubdwarf stars, LS IV-14$^\\circ$116 and Feige 46, are particularly interesting,\nbecause they show extreme enrichments of heavy elements such as Ge, Sr, Y, and\nZr, strikingly similar in both stars. Also their light oscillations are\nsimilar, but occur at periods incompatible with standard pulsation theory. We\ninvestigate the metal abundances in both stars and validate the pulsations in\nFeige 46 using its recent TESS light curve. High-resolution spectroscopy is\ncombined with non-LTE model atmospheres calculated with Tlusty and Synspec to\ndetermine metal abundances consistently. Many lines are identified with\ntransitions originating from Ga III, Ge III-IV, Se III, Kr III, Sr II-III, Y\nIII, Zr III-IV, and Sn IV, most of which have not been observed so far in any\nstar. The abundances of 19 metals in both stars are almost identical, light\nmetals being slightly more abundant in Feige 46 while Zr, Sn, and Pb are\nslightly less enhanced compared to LS IV$-$14$^\\circ$116. Both abundance\npatterns are distinctively different from those of He-poor subdwarfs of similar\ntemperature. The enrichment in heavy metals of more than 4 dex compared to the\nSun is likely the result of strong atmospheric diffusion processes while the\nstars' similar patterns of C, N, O, and Ne abundances might provide clues to\ntheir as yet unclear evolutionary history. Finally, we find that the periods of\nthe pulsation modes in Feige 46 are stable to better than $\\dot{P} \\lesssim\n10^{-8}$ s/s. This is not compatible with $\\dot P$ predicted for pulsations\ndriven by the $\\epsilon$-mechanism and excited by helium-shell flashes in a\nstar which is evolving, for example, onto the extended horizontal branch.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Sep 2020 19:19:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-28"}

Designed for rare-event simulations\nwhere the probability of a target event occurring is relatively small, the\nCE-method relies on enough objective function calls to accurately estimate the\noptimal parameters of the underlying distribution. Certain objective functions\nmay be computationally expensive to evaluate, and the CE-method could\npotentially get stuck in local minima. This is compounded with the need to have\nan initial covariance wide enough to cover the design space of interest. We\nintroduce novel variants of the CE-method to address these concerns. To\nmitigate expensive function calls, during optimization we use every sample to\nbuild a surrogate model to approximate the objective function. The surrogate\nmodel augments the belief of the objective function with less expensive\nevaluations. We use a Gaussian process for our surrogate model to incorporate\nuncertainty in the predictions which is especially helpful when dealing with\nsparse data. To address local minima convergence, we use Gaussian mixture\nmodels to encourage exploration of the design space. We experiment with\nevaluation scheduling techniques to reallocate true objective function calls\nearlier in the optimization when the covariance is the largest.

The\naccumulation of active particles in low activity regions has led to the general\nbelief that chemotaxis requires additional features and at least a minimal\nability to process information and to control motion. We show that\nself-propelled particles display chemotaxis and move into regions of higher\nactivity, if the particles perform work on passive objects, or cargo, to which\nthey are bound. The origin of this cooperative chemotaxis is the exploration of\nthe activity gradient by the active particle when bound to a load, resulting in\nan average excess force on the load in the direction of higher activity. Using\na minimalistic theoretical model, we capture the most relevant features of\nthese active-passive dimers and in particular we predict the crossover between\nanti-chemotactic and chemotactic behaviour. Moreover we show that merely\nconnecting active particles to chains is sufficient to obtain the crossover\nfrom anti-chemotaxis to chemotaxis with increasing chain length. Such an active\ncomplex is capable of moving up a gradient of activity such as provided by a\ngradient of fuel and to accumulate where the fuel concentration is at its\nmaximum. The observed transition is of significance to proto-forms of life\nenabling them to locate a source of nutrients even in the absence of any\nsupporting sensomotoric apparatus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Sep 2020 20:47:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-26"}

Recent mitigations propose\nrandomized mapping of addresses to cache lines to obfuscate the locations of\nset-conflicts. However, these are vulnerable to new attacks that discover\nconflicting sets of addresses despite such mitigations, because these designs\nselect eviction-candidates from a small set of conflicting lines.\n  This paper presents Mirage, a practical design for a fully associative cache,\nwherein eviction candidates are selected randomly from all lines resident in\nthe cache, to be immune to set-conflicts. A key challenge for enabling such\ndesigns in large shared caches (containing tens of thousands of cache lines) is\nthe complexity of cache-lookup, as a naive design can require searching through\nall the resident lines. Mirage achieves full-associativity while retaining\npractical set-associative lookups by decoupling placement and replacement,\nusing pointer-based indirection from tag-store to data-store to allow a newly\ninstalled address to globally evict the data of any random resident line. To\neliminate set-conflicts, Mirage provisions extra invalid tags in a\nskewed-associative tag-store design where lines can be installed without\nset-conflict, along with a load-aware skew-selection policy that guarantees the\navailability of sets with invalid tags. Our analysis shows Mirage provides the\nglobal eviction property of a fully-associative cache throughout system\nlifetime (violations of full-associativity, i.e. set-conflicts, occur less than\nonce in 10^4 to 10^17 years), thus offering a principled defense against any\neviction-set discovery and any potential conflict based attacks.

We\nobserve that the energy-efficiency of each of these PDNs varies with the\nprocessor power (e.g., thermal design power (TDP) and dynamic power-state) and\nworkload characteristics. This leads to energy inefficiency and performance\nloss, as modern client processors operate across a wide spectrum of power\nconsumption and execute a wide variety of workloads. We propose FlexWatts, a\nhybrid adaptive PDN for modern client processors whose goal is to provide high\nenergy-efficiency across the processor's wide range of power consumption and\nworkloads by dynamically allocating PDNs to processor domains. FlexWatts is\nbased on three key ideas. First, it combines IVRs and LDOs in a novel way to\nshare multiple on-chip and off-chip resources. This hybrid PDN is allocated for\nprocessor domains with a wide power consumption range and it dynamically\nswitches between two modes: IVR-Mode and LDO-Mode, depending on the power\nconsumption. Second, for all other processor domains, FlexWatts statically\nallocates off-chip VRs. Third, FlexWatts introduces a prediction algorithm that\nswitches the hybrid PDN to the mode that is the most beneficial. To evaluate\nthe tradeoffs of PDNs, we develop and open-source PDNspot, the first validated\narchitectural PDN model that enables quantitative analysis of PDN metrics.\nUsing PDNspot, we evaluate FlexWatts on a wide variety of SPEC CPU2006,\n3DMark06, and battery life workloads against IVR, the state-of-the-art PDN in\nmodern client processors.

It provides an assistive technology that enables persons\nwith motor disabilities to communicate with the world and also empowers them to\nlead independent lives. The common BCI devices use Electroencephalography (EEG)\nelectrical activity recorded from the scalp. EEG signals are noisy owing to the\npresence of many artifacts, namely, eye blink, head movement, and jaw movement.\nSuch artifacts corrupt the EEG signal and make EEG analysis challenging. This\nissue is addressed by locating the artifacts and excluding the EEG segment from\nthe analysis, which could lead to a loss of useful information. However, we\npropose a practical BCI that uses the artifacts which has a low signal to noise\nratio.\n  The objective of our work is to classify different types of artifacts, namely\neye blink, head nod, head turn, and jaw movements in the EEG signal. The\noccurrence of the artifacts is first located in the EEG signal. The located\nartifacts are then classified using linear time and dynamic time warping\ntechniques. The located artifacts can be used by a person with a motor\ndisability to control a smartphone. A speech synthesis application that uses\neyeblinks in a single channel EEG system and jaw clinches in four channels EEG\nsystem are developed. Word prediction models are used for word completion, thus\nreducing the number of artifacts required.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Sep 2020 23:03:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-22"}

The contrast agents were separated and the\nconcentration was quantified using K-edge subtraction. To increase system\nperformance, we investigated three parameters: beam filter type and thickness,\nprojection acquisition time, and energy bin width.

However, MTL must deal\nwith challenges such as: overfitting to low resource tasks, catastrophic\nforgetting, and negative task transfer, or learning interference. Often, in\nNatural Language Processing (NLP), a separate model per task is needed to\nobtain the best performance. However, many fine-tuning approaches are both\nparameter inefficient, i.e., potentially involving one new model per task, and\nhighly susceptible to losing knowledge acquired during pretraining. We propose\na novel Transformer architecture consisting of a new conditional attention\nmechanism as well as a set of task-conditioned modules that facilitate weight\nsharing. Through this construction (a hypernetwork adapter), we achieve more\nefficient parameter sharing and mitigate forgetting by keeping half of the\nweights of a pretrained model fixed. We also use a new multi-task data sampling\nstrategy to mitigate the negative effects of data imbalance across tasks. Using\nthis approach, we are able to surpass single task fine-tuning methods while\nbeing parameter and data efficient (using around 66% of the data for weight\nupdates).

Wind-fed supra-exponential accretion of an\ninitially wandering black hole in NSCs can lead to extremely fast growth,\nscaling stellar mass remnant seed black holes up to intermediate mass black\nholes (IMBHs).

In an area where many known compounds are present (the\ninterpolation area), an accurate model can be constructed. In contrast, data in\nareas where there are no known compounds (the extrapolation area) are generally\ndifficult to predict. However, in the development of new materials, it is\ndesirable to search this extrapolation area and discover compounds with\nunprecedented physical properties. In this paper, we propose Stochastic\nThreshold Model Trees (STMT), an extrapolation method that reflects the trend\nof the data, while maintaining the accuracy of conventional interpolation\nmethods.

One of the ways to achieve dynamic inference is to use\nmulti-stage neural network, which contains a sub-network with prediction layer\nat each stage. The inference of a input sample can exit from early stage if the\nprediction of the stage is confident enough. However, design a multi-stage CNN\narchitecture is a non-trivial task. In this paper, we introduce a general\nframework, ENAS4D, which can efficiently search for optimal multi-stage CNN\narchitecture for dynamic inference in a well-designed search space. Firstly, we\npropose a method to construct the search space with multi-stage convolution.\nThe search space include different numbers of layers, different kernel sizes\nand different numbers of channels for each stage and the resolution of input\nsamples.

To demonstrate the usefulness of\nsuch a dynamical topological invariant, we consider a variant of the\nperiodically kicked Harper model (the very first model in studies of Floquet\ntopological phases) that exhibits many Weyl points, with the number of Weyl\npoints rising unlimitedly with the strength of some system parameters.\nFurthermore, we investigate the two-terminal transport signature associated\nwith the Weyl points. Theoretical findings of this work pave the way for\nexperimentally probing the rich topological band structures of some seemingly\nsimple Floquet semimetal systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Sep 2020 08:52:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Mar 2021 12:11:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-31"}

These sequences are referred to\nas schedule sequences. Since each node starts its transmission schedule\nindependently, there exist relative time offsets among the schedule sequences\nthey use. Our objective is to design schedule sequences such that each node can\ntransmit at least one packet to each of its neighbors successfully within a\ncommon period, no matter what the time offsets are. The sequence period should\nbe designed as short as possible. In this paper, we analyze the lower bound on\nsequence period, and propose a sequence construction method by which the period\ncan achieve the same order as the lower bound.\n  We also consider the random scheme in which each node transmits or receives\non a channel at each time slot with a pre-determined probability.

However, the current GCN-based methods treat graph construction\nand image classification as two separate tasks, which often results in\nsuboptimal performance. Another defect of these methods is that they mainly\nfocus on modeling the local pairwise importance between graph nodes while lack\nthe capability to capture the global contextual information of HSI. In this\npaper, we propose a Multi-level GCN with Automatic Graph Learning method\n(MGCN-AGL) for HSI classification, which can automatically learn the graph\ninformation at both local and global levels. By employing attention mechanism\nto characterize the importance among spatially neighboring regions, the most\nrelevant information can be adaptively incorporated to make decisions, which\nhelps encode the spatial context to form the graph information at local level.\nMoreover, we utilize multiple pathways for local-level graph convolution, in\norder to leverage the merits from the diverse spatial context of HSI and to\nenhance the expressive power of the generated representations. To reconstruct\nthe global contextual relations, our MGCN-AGL encodes the long range\ndependencies among image regions based on the expressive representations that\nhave been produced at local level. Then inference can be performed along the\nreconstructed graph edges connecting faraway regions. Finally, the multi-level\ninformation is adaptively fused to generate the network output. In this means,\nthe graph learning and image classification can be integrated into a unified\nframework and benefit each other. Extensive experiments have been conducted on\nthree real-world hyperspectral datasets, which are shown to outperform the\nstate-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Sep 2020 09:26:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-22"}

It\ndefines an over-parameterized network with mixed edges, each of which\nrepresents all operator candidates, and jointly optimizes the weights of the\nnetwork and its architecture in an alternating manner. However, this method\nfinds a model with the weights converging faster than the others, and such a\nmodel with fastest convergence often leads to overfitting. Accordingly, the\nresulting model cannot always be well-generalized. To overcome this problem, we\npropose a method called minimum stable rank DARTS (MSR-DARTS), for finding a\nmodel with the best generalization error by replacing architecture optimization\nwith the selection process using the minimum stable rank criterion.\nSpecifically, a convolution operator is represented by a matrix, and MSR-DARTS\nselects the one with the smallest stable rank. We evaluated MSR-DARTS on\nCIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. It achieves an error rate of 2.54% with 4.0M\nparameters within 0.3 GPU-days on CIFAR-10, and a top-1 error rate of 23.9% on\nImageNet.

We believe that producing DeepFakes that are highly\nrealistic and 'detection evasive' can serve the ultimate goal of improving\nfuture generation DeepFake detection capabilities. In this paper, we propose a\nsimple yet powerful pipeline to reduce the artifact patterns of fake images\nwithout hurting image quality by performing implicit spatial-domain notch\nfiltering. We first demonstrate that frequency-domain notch filtering, although\nfamously shown to be effective in removing periodic noise in the spatial\ndomain, is infeasible for our task at hand due to the manual designs required\nfor the notch filters. We, therefore, resort to a learning-based approach to\nreproduce the notch filtering effects, but solely in the spatial domain. We\nadopt a combination of adding overwhelming spatial noise for breaking the\nperiodic noise pattern and deep image filtering to reconstruct the noise-free\nfake images, and we name our method DeepNotch. Deep image filtering provides a\nspecialized filter for each pixel in the noisy image, producing filtered images\nwith high fidelity compared to their DeepFake counterparts.

Extensive work in linguistic\ntypology has sought to characterize word class flexibility across languages,\nbut quantifying this phenomenon accurately and at scale has been fraught with\ndifficulties. We propose a principled methodology to explore regularity in word\nclass flexibility. Our method builds on recent work in contextualized word\nembeddings to quantify semantic shift between word classes (e.g., noun-to-verb,\nverb-to-noun), and we apply this method to 37 languages.

MAVIS is a general-purpose instrument\nfor exploiting the highest possible angular resolution of any single optical\ntelescope available in the next decade, either on Earth or in space, and with\nsensitivity comparable to (or better than) larger aperture facilities. MAVIS\nuses two deformable mirrors in addition to the deformable secondary mirror of\nthe AOF, providing a mean V-band Strehl ratio of >10% (goal >15%) across a\nrelatively large (30 arc second) science field. This equates to a resolution of\n<20mas at 550nm - comparable to the K-band diffraction limit of the next\ngeneration of extremely large telescopes, making MAVIS a genuine optical\ncounterpart to future IR-optimised facilities like JWST and the ELT. Moreover,\nMAVIS will have unprecedented sky coverage for a high-order AO system,\naccessing at least 50% of the sky at the Galactic Pole, making MAVIS a truly\ngeneral purpose facility instrument. As such, MAVIS will have both a\nNyquist-sampled imager (30x30 arcsec field), and a powerful integral field\nspectrograph with multiple spatial and spectral modes spanning 370-1000nm.

In this work, we use simulation samples produced by the hybrid\ncosmological hydrodynamical/N-body code, to investigate on what scale the\ndeviation of spatial distributions between baryons and dark matter is caused by\nturbulence. For this purpose, we do not include the physical processes such as\nstar formation, supernovae (SNe) and active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback\ninto our code, so that the effect of turbulence heating for IGM can be\nexhibited to the most extent. By computing cross-correlation functions $r_m(k)$\nfor the density field and $r_v(k)$ for the velocity field of both baryons and\ndark matter, we find that deviations between the two matter components for both\ndensity field and velocity field, as expected, are scale-dependent. That is,\nthe deviations are the most significant at small scales and gradually diminish\non larger and larger scales. Also, the deviations are time-dependent, i.e. they\nbecome larger and larger with increasing cosmic time. The most emphasized\nresult is that the spatial deviations between baryons and dark matter revealed\nby velocity field are more significant than that by density field. At z = 0, at\nthe 1% level of deviation, the deviation scale is about 3.7 $h^{-1}$Mpc for\ndensity field, while as large as 23 $h^{-1}$Mpc for velocity field, a scale\nthat falls within the weakly non-linear regime for the structure formation\nparadigm.

More recently, many works construct deep\nneural networks (DNNs) for chest X-ray images to realize automated and\nefficient diagnosis of lung diseases. However, bias field caused by the\nimproper medical image acquisition process widely exists in the chest X-ray\nimages while the robustness of DNNs to the bias field is rarely explored, which\ndefinitely poses a threat to the X-ray-based automated diagnosis system. In\nthis paper, we study this problem based on the recent adversarial attack and\npropose a brand new attack, i.e., the adversarial bias field attack where the\nbias field instead of the additive noise works as the adversarial perturbations\nfor fooling the DNNs. This novel attack posts a key problem: how to locally\ntune the bias field to realize high attack success rate while maintaining its\nspatial smoothness to guarantee high realisticity. These two goals contradict\neach other and thus has made the attack significantly challenging. To overcome\nthis challenge, we propose the adversarial-smooth bias field attack that can\nlocally tune the bias field with joint smooth & adversarial constraints. As a\nresult, the adversarial X-ray images can not only fool the DNNs effectively but\nalso retain very high level of realisticity. We validate our method on real\nchest X-ray datasets with powerful DNNs, e.g., ResNet50, DenseNet121, and\nMobileNet, and show different properties to the state-of-the-art attacks in\nboth image realisticity and attack transferability.

The goal is to\nreach an objective by exploiting the temporal relation inherent to the nature's\nfeedback (state). By exploiting this relation, specific learning systems can be\ndesigned that perform asymptotically optimal for various applications. However,\nif the framework of the problem is not stationary, i.e., the nature's state\nsometimes changes arbitrarily, the past cumulative belief revision done by the\nsystem may become useless and the system may fail if it lacks adaptivity. While\nthis adaptivity can be directly implemented in specific cases (e.g., convex\noptimization), it is mostly not straightforward for general learning tasks. To\nthis end, we propose an efficient optimal mixture framework for general\nsequential learning systems, which we call the recursive experts for dynamic\nenvironments. For this purpose, we design hyper-experts that incorporate the\nlearning systems at our disposal and recursively merge in a specific way to\nachieve minimax optimal regret bounds up to constant factors.

However, it\ninevitably poses an entirely new safety and security issue, i.e., highly\npersonal and sensitive content can potentially be extracting by powerful CoSOD\nmethods. In this paper, we address this problem from the perspective of\nadversarial attacks and identify a novel task: adversarial co-saliency attack.\nSpecially, given an image selected from a group of images containing some\ncommon and salient objects, we aim to generate an adversarial version that can\nmislead CoSOD methods to predict incorrect co-salient regions. Note that,\ncompared with general white-box adversarial attacks for classification, this\nnew task faces two additional challenges: (1) low success rate due to the\ndiverse appearance of images in the group; (2) low transferability across CoSOD\nmethods due to the considerable difference between CoSOD pipelines. To address\nthese challenges, we propose the very first black-box joint adversarial\nexposure and noise attack (Jadena), where we jointly and locally tune the\nexposure and additive perturbations of the image according to a newly designed\nhigh-feature-level contrast-sensitive loss function. Our method, without any\ninformation on the state-of-the-art CoSOD methods, leads to significant\nperformance degradation on various co-saliency detection datasets and makes the\nco-salient objects undetectable. This can have strong practical benefits in\nproperly securing the large number of personal photos currently shared on the\nInternet. Moreover, our method is potential to be utilized as a metric for\nevaluating the robustness of CoSOD methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Sep 2020 15:43:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 24 Apr 2021 02:52:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 25 Nov 2021 10:50:54 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 15 Apr 2022 03:03:10 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 18 Apr 2022 02:39:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-19"}
