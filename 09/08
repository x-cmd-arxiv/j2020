Thanks to their highly variable emissions\nand complex phenomenology, they have attracted the interest of the high energy\nastrophysical community since the dawn of X-ray Astronomy. In more recent\nyears, they have challenged our comprehension of physical processes in many\nmore energy bands, ranging from the infrared to very high energies. In this\nreview, we provide a broad but concise summary of the physical processes\ndominating the emission from high mass X-ray binaries across virtually the\nwhole electromagnetic spectrum. These comprise the interaction of stellar winds\nwith the high gravitational and magnetic fields of compact objects, the\nbehaviour of matter under extreme magnetic and gravity conditions, and the\nperturbation of the massive star evolutionary processes by presence in a binary\nsystem. We highlight the role of the INTEGRAL mission in the discovery of many\nof the most interesting objects in the high mass X-ray binary class and its\ncontribution in reviving the interest for these sources over the past two\ndecades. We show how the INTEGRAL discoveries have not only contributed to\nsignificantly increase the number of high mass X-ray binaries known, thus\nadvancing our understanding of the population as a whole, but also have opened\nnew windows of investigation that stimulated the multi-wavelength approach\nnowadays common in most astrophysical research fields.

Moreover, they improve product sales and validate the\nreputation of the website as a whole. Thus, it becomes important to design\nreviews ranking methods that help shoppers make informed decisions quickly.\nHowever, reviews ranking has its unique challenges. First, there is no\nrelevance labels for reviews. A relevant review for shopper A might not be\nrelevant to shopper B. Second, since shoppers cannot click on reviews, we have\nno ways of getting relevance feedback. Eventually, reviews ranking suffers from\nthe lack of ground truth due to the variability in the standard of relevance\nfor different users. In this paper, we aim to address the challenges of helping\nusers to find information they might be interested in from the sea of customer\nreviews. Using the Amazon Customer Reviews Dataset collected and organized by\nUCSD, we first constructed user profiles based on user's personal web trails,\nrecent shopping history and previous reviews, incorporated user profiles into\nour ranking algorithm, and assigned higher ranks to reviews that address\nindividual shopper's concerns to the largest extent. Also, we leveraged user\nprofiles to recommend products based on reviews texts.

The\nmutual information reaches a finite value in the infinite-temperature limit,\nwhich is the consequence of the infinite linear electron spectrum of Luttinger\ntheory. The entanglement negativity becomes exactly zero above a certain\ntemperature, i.e., the lattice and the electrons become non-entangled above\nthis temperature.

This, however, is a challenging and\nill-posed problem as there is an infinite number of valid decompositions. To\naddress this problem, we propose a user-assisted method for video reflection\nremoval. We rely on both spatial and temporal information and utilize sparse\nuser hints to help improve separation. The key idea of the proposed method is\nto use motion cues to separate the background layer from the reflection layer\nwith minimal user assistance. We show that user-assistance significantly\nimproves the layer separation results. We implement and evaluate the proposed\nmethod through quantitative and qualitative results on real and synthetic\nvideos.

We present a formalism to compress arbitrary\nobservables into a small number of bins by projection into a model-specific\nsubspace that minimizes the prior-averaged log-likelihood error. The lower\ndimensionality leads to a dramatic reduction in covariance matrix noise,\nsignificantly reducing the number of mocks that need to be computed. Given a\ntheory model, a set of priors, and a simple model of the covariance, our method\nworks by using singular value decompositions to construct a basis for the\nobservable that is close to Euclidean; by restricting to the first few basis\nvectors, we can capture almost all the constraining power in a\nlower-dimensional subspace. Unlike conventional approaches, the method can be\ntailored for specific analyses and captures non-linearities that are not\npresent in the Fisher matrix, ensuring that the full likelihood can be\nreproduced. The procedure is validated with full-shape analyses of power\nspectra from BOSS DR12 mock catalogs, showing that the 96-bin power spectra can\nbe replaced by 12 subspace coefficients without biasing the output cosmology;\nthis allows for accurate parameter inference using only $\\sim 100$ mocks.

We find that\nin the hybrid model the distribution of groomed $\\Delta R$ appears to be\nunmodified in a sample of jets selected after quenching, as in heavy ion\ncollisions, and confirm that this lack of modification arises because of a\nselection bias toward jets that lose only a small fraction of their energy.

The wide field probes a statistically representative volume of the\nUniverse at high redshift. The Chandra Deep Wide-Field Survey exploits the\nexcellent sensitivity and angular resolution of Chandra over a wide area,\ncombining 281 observations spanning 15 years, for a total exposure time of 3.4\nMs, and detects 6891 X-ray point sources down to limiting fluxes of\n$4.7\\times10^{-16}$, $1.5\\times10^{-16}$, and $9\\times10^{-16}$ erg cm$^{-2}$\ns$^{-1}$, in the $0.5-7$ keV, $0.5-2$ keV, and $2-7$ keV bands, respectively.\nThe robustness and reliability of the detection strategy is validated through\nextensive, state-of-the-art simulations of the whole field. Accurate number\ncounts, in good agreement with previous X-ray surveys, are derived thanks to\nthe uniquely large number of point sources detected, which resolve $65.0 \\pm\n12.8\\%$ of the cosmic X-ray background between $0.5-2$ keV and $81.0 \\pm\n11.5\\%$ between $2-7$ keV. Exploiting the wealth of multi-wavelength data\navailable on the field, we assign redshifts to $\\sim 94\\%$ of the X-ray\nsources, estimate their obscuration and derive absorption-corrected\nluminosities. We provide an electronic catalog containing all the relevant\nquantities needed for future investigations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Sep 2020 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-28"}

A long standing issue is the identification of\nthe BL Lac parent population, having jets oriented at larger angles. According\nto the \"unification scenario\" of AGNs, radio galaxies with low luminosity and\nedge-darkened radio morphology are the most promising candidates to be the\nparent population of BL Lacs.

Its first spectrum shows similarities to broad-lined Type Ic\nsupernovae around maximum light, whereas later spectra display strong\nsignatures of interaction between rapidly expanding ejecta and a dense H-rich\ncircumstellar medium, coinciding with a second peak in the photometric\nevolution of the transient. This evolution, along with the results of modeling\nof the first light curve peak, suggests a scenario where a stripped star\nexploded within a dense circumstellar medium. The two main phases in the\nevolution of the transient could be interpreted as a first phase dominated by\nradioactive decays, and an later interaction-dominated phase where the ejecta\ncollide with a pre-existing shell. We therefore discuss SN 2018jp within the\ncontext of a massive star depleted of its outer layers exploding within a dense\nH-rich circumstellar medium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Sep 2020 18:00:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Apr 2021 20:14:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 26 Apr 2021 11:03:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-30"}

In particular, by neglecting departures from\nthe adiabatic evolution of long-wavelength modes (for instance, produced in\nsharp transitions between slow-roll and ultra slow-roll phases), we derive a\ngeneral expression for the bispectrum's squeezed limit in co-moving\ncoordinates.

Here we estimate stellar parameters for\nall of the giant stars from the EXPRESS project, which aims to detect planets\norbiting evolved stars, and study their occurrence rate as a function of\nstellar mass. We analyse high resolution echelle spectra of these stars, and\ncompute the atmospheric parameters by measuring the equivalent widths for a set\nof iron lines, using an updated method implemented during this work.

We then bound utility differences between bundles\nand welfare differences between prices. All bounds are computable as linear\nprograms. We provide detailed analytical results describing how the data map to\nthe bounds including shape restrictions that provide a foundation for plug-in\nestimation.

The objective is to identify potential sub-networks in the\nexisting distribution grid; that are likely to survive as self-adequate islands\nif supply from the main grid is lost. {This constitutes a planning problem.}\nPractical constraints like ensuring network radiality and availability of\ngrid-forming generators are considered. Quality of the obtained solution is\nevaluated by comparison with: a) an upper bound on the probability that the\nidentified islands are supply-deficient, and b) a lower bound on the optimal\nvalue of the true problem. Performance of the ODNP formulation is illustrated\non a modified IEEE 37-bus feeder.

Prior to the start of\nthe FEKO simulation studies, a physical mechanical dimension measurements via a\nDigital instrumentation were conducted for the following: Radiating Element\nSize: The actual length (L), and width (W), Substrate Material Size: The\nsubstrate length (Lsub), width (Wsub), and height (h). The proposed antenna\nmodel for GPS only patch antenna operating at 1.57542 GHz and the dual band\npatch antenna resonating at 1.5925 GHz are developed.

We refined the planets' ephemerides through\nSpitzer transits, enabling accurate transit prediction required for future\natmospheric characterization through transmission spectroscopy. Through a\nmulti-year high-cadence observing campaign with Keck/HIRES and Magellan/PFS, we\nimproved the planets' mass measurements in anticipation of HST transmission\nspectroscopy. For GJ 9827, we modeled activity-induced radial velocity signals\nwith a Gaussian process informed from the Calcium II H&K lines in order to more\naccurately model the effect of stellar noise on our data. We found planet\nmasses of M$_b$=$4.87\\pm 0.37$ M$_\\oplus$, M$_c$=$1.92\\pm 0.49$ M$_\\oplus$, and\nM$_d$=$3.42\\pm 0.62$ M$_\\oplus$. For HD 106315, we found that such\nactivity-radial velocity decorrelation was not effective due to the reduced\npresence of spots and speculate that this may extend to other hot stars as well\n(T$_{\\rm {eff}}>6200$ K).

We investigated all of the\nplanets' compositions through comparing their masses and radii to a range of\ninterior models. GJ 9827 b and GJ 9827 c are both consistent with an Earth-like\nrocky composition, GJ 9827 d and HD 106315 b both require additional volatiles\nand are consistent with moderate amounts of water or hydrogen/helium, and HD\n106315 c is consistent with 10% hydrogen/helium surrounding an Earth-like rock\nand iron core.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Sep 2020 20:09:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 12 Sep 2020 20:15:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2021 21:15:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-06"}

According to RD, a non-equilibrium system after a\nquench relies on fluctuations that randomly generate a sequence of irreversible\nrecord-sized events (quakes or avalanches) that allow the system to escape\never-higher barriers of meta-stable states within a complex, hierarchical\nenergy landscape. Once these record events allow the system to overcome such\nbarriers, the system relaxes by tumbling into the following meta-stable state\nthat is marginally more stable. Within this framework, a clear distinction can\nbe drawn between the coarsening dynamics of an Ising ferromagnet and the aging\nof the spin glass, which are often put in the same category. To that end, we\ninterpolate between the spin glass and ferromagnet by varying the admixture $p$\nof ferromagnetic over anti-ferromagnetic bonds from the glassy state (at 50%\neach) to wherever clear ferromagnetic behavior emerges. The accumulation of\nrecord events grows logarithmic with time in the glassy regime, with a sharp\ntransition at a specific admixture into the ferromagnetic regime where such\nactivations saturate quickly.

Methods: First, the equivalence between electrical and\nthermal properties of the nerve materials is established, and results of a pure\nheat conduction analysis performed in Abaqus CAE Software 6.13-3 are validated\nwith analytical solutions for a range of steady and transient conditions. This\nvalidation includes the definition of equivalent active membrane properties\nthat enable prediction of the action potential. Then, as a step towards fully\ncoupled models, electromechanical coupling is implemented through the\ndefinition of equivalent piezoelectric properties of the nerve membrane using\nthe thermal expansion coefficient, enabling prediction of the mechanical\nresponse of the nerve to the action potential. Results: Results of the coupled\nelectro-mechanical model are validated with previously published experimental\nresults of deformation for the squid giant axon, crab nerve fibre and garfish\nolfactory nerve fibre. Conclusion: A simplified coupled electro-mechanical\nmodelling approach is established through an electro-thermal equivalent FE\nmodel of a nervous cell for biomedical applications.

Here, we outline\nthe preliminary results for a model of quantum universe, in which gravity is\nfundamentally and by construction quantic. The model is based on three well\nmotivated assumptions with compelling observational and theoretical evidence:\nquantum mechanics is valid at all scales; quantum systems are described by\ntheir symmetries; universe has infinite independent degrees of freedom. The\nlast assumption means that the Hilbert space of the Universe has\n$SU(N\\rightarrow \\infty) \\cong \\text{area preserving Diff.} (S_2)$ symmetry,\nwhich is parameterized by two angular variables. We show that, in the absence\nof a background spacetime, this Universe is trivial and static. Nonetheless,\nquantum fluctuations break the symmetry and divide the Universe to subsystems.\nWhen a subsystem is singled out as reference -- observer -- and another as\nclock, two more continuous parameters arise, which can be interpreted as\ndistance and time. We identify the classical spacetime with parameter space of\nthe Hilbert space of the Universe. Therefore, its quantization is meaningless.\nIn this view, the Einstein equation presents the projection of quantum dynamics\nin the Hilbert space into its parameter space.

Schrodinger's equation\nstill is valid in one model of the axioms of quantum theory, which I call the\nSchrodinger model.

However, recent high-profile accidents have\nsignificantly impacted consumer confidence in this technology. The cause for\nmany of these accidents can be traced back to the inability of these vehicles\nto correctly sense the impending danger. In response, manufacturers have been\nimproving the already extensive on-vehicle sensor packages to ensure that the\nsystem always has access to the data necessary to ensure safe navigation.\nHowever, these sensor packages only provide a view from the vehicle's\nperspective and, as a result, autonomous vehicles still require frequent human\nintervention to ensure safety.\n  To address this issue, I developed a system, called Horus, that combines\non-vehicle and infrastructure-based sensors to provide a more complete view of\nthe environment, including areas not visible from the vehicle. I built a\nsmall-scale experimental testbed as a proof of concept. My measurements of the\nimpact of sensor failures showed that even short outages (1 second) at slow\nspeeds (25 km/hr scaled velocity) prevents vehicles that rely on on-vehicle\nsensors from navigating properly. My experiments also showed that Horus\ndramatically improves driving safety and that the sensor fusion algorithm\nselected plays a significant role in the quality of the navigation. With just a\npair of infrastructure sensors, Horus could tolerate sensors that fail 40% of\nthe time and still navigate safely. These results are a promising first step\ntowards safer autonomous vehicles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Sep 2020 23:52:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-09"}

This\ndetermination is especially important, but difficult, in the context of\ncontrolling transitional flows. The highly non-normal nature of the linearized\nNavier-Stokes equations makes the flow sensitive to small perturbations, with\npotentially drastic performance consequences on closed-loop flow control\nperformance. Full-information controllers, such as the linear quadratic\nregulator (LQR), have demonstrated some success in reducing transient energy\ngrowth and suppressing transition; however, sensor-based output feedback\ncontrollers with comparable performance have been difficult to realize. In this\nstudy, we propose two methods for sensor selection that enable sensor-based\noutput feedback controllers to recover full-information control performance:\none based on a sparse controller synthesis approach, and one based on a\nbalanced truncation procedure for model reduction.

EKI iterates the Kalman update of ensemble-based Kalman filters,\nwhose ensemble converges to a minimizer of an objective function. EKI\nregularizes ill-posed problems by restricting the ensemble to the linear span\nof the initial ensemble, or by iterating regularization with early stopping.\nAnother regularization approach for EKI, Tikhonov EKI, penalizes the objective\nfunction using the $l_2$ penalty term, preventing overfitting in the standard\nEKI. This paper proposes a strategy to implement $l_p, 0<p\\leq 1,$\nregularization for EKI to recover sparse structures in the solution. The\nstrategy transforms a $l_p$ problem into a $l_2$ problem, which is then solved\nby Tikhonov EKI. The transformation is explicit, and thus the proposed approach\nhas a computational cost comparable to Tikhonov EKI.

The systems composed of soft particles are especially interesting in\nthis context because they often demonstrate non-trivial local orders that do\nnot allow to introduce the concept of the nearest-neighbor shell. For this\nreason, the use of some methods, developed for the structure analysis of atomic\nliquids, is questionable for the soft-particle systems. Here we report about\nour investigations of the structure of the simple harmonic-repulsive liquid in\n3D using the triple correlation function (TCF), i.e., the method that does not\nrely on the nearest neighbor concept. The liquid is considered at reduced\npressure ($P=1.8$) at which it exhibits remarkable stability against\ncrystallization on cooling. It is demonstrated that the TCF allows addressing\nthe development of the orientational correlations in the structures that do not\nallow drawing definite conclusions from the studies of the bond-orientational\norder parameters. Our results demonstrate that the orientational correlations,\nif measured by the heights of the peaks in the TCF, significantly increase on\ncooling. This rise in the orientational ordering is not captured properly by\nthe Kirkwood's superposition approximation. Detailed considerations of the\npeaks' shapes in the TCF suggest the existence of a link between the\norientational ordering and the slowdown of the system's dynamics. Our findings\nsupport the view that the development of the orientational correlations in\nliquids may play a significant role in the liquids' dynamics and that the\nconsiderations of the pair distribution function may not be sufficient to\nunderstand intuitively all the structural changes that happen with liquids on\nsupercooling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Sep 2020 03:37:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-09"}

A tensor rank has several definitions, unlike the matrix\nrank--e.g. the CP rank and the Tucker rank. Many low-rank tensor recovery\nmethods are focused on the Tucker rank. Since the Tucker rank is nonconvex and\ndiscontinuous, many relaxations of the Tucker rank have been proposed, e.g.,\nthe tensor nuclear norm, weighted tensor nuclear norm, and weighted tensor\nSchatten-$p$ norm. In particular, the weighted tensor Schatten-p norm has two\nparameters, the weight and $p$, and the tensor nuclear norm and weighted tensor\nnuclear norm are special cases of these parameters. However, there has been no\ndetailed discussion of whether the effects of the weighting and $p$ are\nsynergistic. In this paper, we propose a novel low-rank tensor completion model\nusing the weighted tensor Schatten-$p$ norm to reveal the relationships between\nthe weight and $p$. To clarify whether complex methods such as the weighted\ntensor Schatten-$p$ norm are necessary, we compare them with a simple method\nusing rank-constrained minimization. It was found that the simple methods did\nnot outperform the complex methods unless the rank of the original tensor could\nbe accurately known. If we can obtain the ideal weight, $p = 1$ is sufficient,\nalthough it is necessary to set $p<1$ when using the weights obtained from\nobservations. These results are consistent with existing reports.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Sep 2020 03:39:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-09"}

In this paper,\nwe present Hi-RES, a framework for high-throughput relation extraction\nalgorithm development. We also show that combining knowledge articles with\nelectronic health records (EHRs) significantly increases the classification\naccuracy. Methods: We use relation triplets obtained from structured databases\nand semistructured webpages to label sentences from target corpora as positive\ntraining samples. Two methods are also provided for creating improved negative\nsamples by combining positive samples with na\\\"ive negative samples. We propose\na common model that summarizes sentence information using large-scale\npretrained language models and multi-instance attention, which then joins with\nthe concept embeddings trained from the EHRs for relation prediction. Results:\nWe apply the Hi-RES framework to develop classification algorithms for\ndisorder-disorder relations and disorder-location relations. Millions of\nsentences are created as training data. Using pretrained language models and\nEHR-based embeddings individually provides considerable accuracy increases over\nthose of previous models. Joining them together further tremendously increases\nthe accuracy to 0.947 and 0.998 for the two sets of relations, respectively,\nwhich are 10-17 percentage points higher than those of previous models.\nConclusion: Hi-RES is an efficient framework for achieving high-throughput and\naccurate relation extraction algorithm development.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Sep 2020 03:48:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-09"}

The closed nature forces a model to assign a label given a new\nsample and may lead to overestimation of known land covers (e.g., crop area).\nTo tackle this issue, we propose a multitask deep learning method that\nsimultaneously conducts classification and reconstruction in the open world\n(named MDL4OW) where unknown classes may exist. The reconstructed data are\ncompared with the original data; those failing to be reconstructed are\nconsidered unknown, based on the assumption that they are not well represented\nin the latent features due to the lack of labels. A threshold needs to be\ndefined to separate the unknown and known classes; we propose two strategies\nbased on the extreme value theory for few-shot and many-shot scenarios.

ORAM is a\npowerful low-level primitive that provides application-agnostic protection for\nany I/O operations, however, at a high cost.

We show that a study of the curl constraint-preserving\nreconstruction gives us a great deal of insight into the design of consistent,\nmimetic schemes for these involutionary PDEs. The importance of\nmultidimensional Riemann solvers in facilitating the design of such schemes is\nalso documented. We study the problem of curl constraint-preserving\nreconstruction as it pertains to the design of mimetic discontinuous Galerkin\n(DG) and finite volume (FV) schemes for PDEs that support such an involution.\nThis is done for two and three dimensional structured mesh problems where we\ndeliver closed form expressions for the reconstruction. The role that this\nreconstruction plays in the curl-free, or curl-preserving prolongation of\nvector fields in adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) is also discussed. In two\ndimensions, a von Neumann analysis of structure-preserving DG-like schemes that\nmimetically satisfy the curl constraints, is also presented. Numerical results\nare also presented to show that the schemes meet their design accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Sep 2020 05:20:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 4 Sep 2021 11:22:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-07"}

Even though UWB offers\na decimeter level accuracy in line-of-sight (LoS) ranging, its accuracy\ndegrades significantly in non-line-of-sight (NLoS) due to the significant\nunknown positive bias in the measurements.

Few-shot image classification has thus been proposed to\neffectively use only a limited number of labeled examples to train models for\nnew classes. Recent works based on transferable metric learning methods have\nachieved promising classification performance through learning the similarity\nbetween the features of samples from the query and support sets. However, rare\nof them explicitly considers the model interpretability, which can actually be\nrevealed during the training phase.\n  For that, in this work, we propose a metric learning based method named\nRegion Comparison Network (RCN), which is able to reveal how few-shot learning\nworks as in a neural network as well as to find out specific regions that are\nrelated to each other in images coming from the query and support sets.\nMoreover, we also present a visualization strategy named Region Activation\nMapping (RAM) to intuitively explain what our method has learned by visualizing\nintermediate variables in our network. We also present a new way to generalize\nthe interpretability from the level of tasks to categories, which can also be\nviewed as a method to find the prototypical parts for supporting the final\ndecision of our RCN.

However, developers may waste their unnecessary effort on\nthe whole filewhile only a small fraction of its source code lines are\ndefective. Indeed, we find that as little as 1%-3% of lines of a file are\ndefective. Hence, in this work, we propose a novel framework (called LINE-DP)\nto identify defective lines using a model-agnostic technique, i.e., an\nExplainable AI technique that provides information why the model makes such a\nprediction. Broadly speaking, our LINE-DP first builds a file-level defect\nmodel using code token features. Then, our LINE-DP uses a state-of-the-art\nmodel-agnostic technique (i.e.,LIME) to identify risky tokens, i.e., code\ntokens that lead the file-level defect model to predict that the file will be\ndefective. Then, the lines that contain risky tokens are predicted as defective\nlines. Through a case study of 32 releases of nine Java open source systems,\nour evaluation results show that our LINE-DP achieves an average recall of\n0.61, a false alarm rate of 0.47, a top 20%LOC recall of0.27, and an initial\nfalse alarm of 16, which are statistically better than six baseline approaches.\nOur evaluation shows that our LINE-DP requires an average computation time of\n10 seconds including model construction and defective line identification time.\nIn addition, we find that 63% of defective lines that can be identified by our\nLINE-DP are related to common defects (e.g., argument change, condition\nchange). These results suggest that our LINE-DP can effectively identify\ndefective lines that contain common defectswhile requiring a smaller amount of\ninspection effort and a manageable computation cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Sep 2020 09:43:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-17"}

Absorption of photons from the evanescent\nwave is avoided by detuning the laser from atomic resonance which makes the\ndetection scheme potentially nondestructive. The spectrum of the signal is\ndetermined by a Fano resonance. We show that atoms can be detected\nnondestructively with single atom resolution for typical parameters in cold\natom experiments.

The largest protests in US history occurred in\nlate May and early June 2020, following the death of George Floyd at the hands\nof Minneapolis police. This incident reignited widespread support for the BLM\nmovement. The protests were notable not only for their size but also that they\noccurred at a time the US was still struggling to control the spread of the\nCOVID-19 pandemic, with more than 20,000 new cases per day. With protest\nconditions and police crowd control tactics exacerbating disease spread and\nwith COVID disproportionately affecting minority populations, it was\nhypothesised that participation in and support for the protests would involve a\nbalancing act between the risks of systemic racism and of disease spread.\nHowever, social media data suggest that this was not the case, with discussion\nof the BLM movement replacing discussion of COVID on US social media. Neither\nsupporters or opposers of the BLM movement or protest action mentioned COVID as\na factor. Framings of the movement by BLM supporters largely replicated those\nof earlier studies, with new frames emerging surrounding the opposition the\nmovement has received from racism, police militarisation and President Donald\nTrump. Discourse evidenced worrying levels of polarisation, hate, incivility\nand conspiracy content and bore many similarities to previously studied COVID\ndiscourse. This suggests that George Floyd's death, as yet another example of\nan African American man killed by US police, was largely seen through\nestablished, polarised identity positions that made reactions to the incident\nand resulting protest largely a foregone conclusion, established and\narticulated without reference to the ongoing pandemic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Sep 2020 09:56:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-09"}

We use the low-complexity RDA model to investigate the\nscale-relationships in the impact of different drivers (turbulent diffusion,\nmean and eddy advection, primary productivity) on the phytoplankton chlorophyll\nconcentrations. We find that in the 1/4{\\deg} (~25km) model, advection has a\nsubstantial impact on the rate of primary productivity, whilst the turbulent\ndiffusion term has a fairly negligible impact. Turbulent diffusion has an\nimpact on the phytoplankton variability, with the impact being scale-propagated\nand amplified by the larger scale surface currents. We investigate the impact\nof a surface nutrient decline and some changes to mesoscale eddy kinetic energy\n(climate change projections) on the surface phytoplankton concentrations. The\nRDA model suggests that unless mesoscale eddies radically change, phytoplankton\nchlorophyll scales sub-linearly with the nutrients, and it is relatively stable\nwith respect to the nutrient concentrations. Furthermore we explore how a white\nmultiplicative Gaussian noise introduced into the RDA model on its resolution\nscale propagates across spatial scales through the non-linear model dynamics\nunder different sets of phytoplankton drivers. The unifying message of this\nwork is that the low complexity (e.g. RDA) models can be successfully used to\nrealistically model some specific aspects of marine ecosystem dynamics and by\nusing those models one can explore many questions that would be beyond\ncomputational affordability of the higher-complexity ecosystem models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Sep 2020 10:21:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 22:02:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-13"}

To perform\nsuch measurement, while keeping the pump induced perturbation to the sample as\nsmall as possible, it is essential to have a detection scheme with high signal\nto noise ratio. Achieving such high signal to noise ratio is easy with phase\nsensitive detection based on lock-in-amplifier when a high repetition rate\nlaser is used as the optical pulse source. However such a lock-in-amplifier\nbased method does not work well when a low repetition rate laser is used for\nthe measurement.

A theoretical model to explain the process of\nsignal detection and a method to reduce the pulse to pulse energy fluctuation\nin probe pulses is presented. By performing pump-probe measurements at various\ndetection conditions the optimum condition required for obtaining transient\nabsorption signal with low noise is presented.

While it has been recognized that hospitals\nmay differ in their SMRs due to differences in patient composition, there is a\nlack of rigorous analysis of this and other - largely unrecognized - properties\nof the SMR. Methods: This paper proposes five axiomatic requirements for\nadequate standardized mortality measures: strict monotonicity, case-mix\ninsensitivity, scale insensitivity, equivalence principle, and dominance\nprinciple. Given these axiomatic requirements, effects of variations in patient\ncomposition, hospital size, and actual and expected mortality rates on the SMR\nwere examined using basic algebra and calculus. In this regard, we\ndistinguished between standardization using expected mortality rates derived\nfrom a different dataset (external standardization) and standardization based\non a dataset including the considered hospitals (internal standardization).\nResults: Under external standardization, the SMR fulfills the axiomatic\nrequirements of strict monotonicity and scale insensitivity but violates the\nrequirement of case-mix insensitivity, the equivalence principle, and the\ndominance principle. All axiomatic requirements not fulfilled under external\nstandardization are also not fulfilled under internal standardization. In\naddition, the SMR under internal standardization is scale sensitive and\nviolates the axiomatic requirement of strict monotonicity. Conclusions: The SMR\nfulfills only two (none) out of the five proposed axiomatic requirements under\nexternal (internal) standardization. Generally, the SMRs of hospitals are\ndifferently affected by variations in case mix and actual and expected\nmortality rates unless the hospitals are identical in these characteristics.\nThese properties hamper valid assessment and comparison of hospital performance\nbased on the SMR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Sep 2020 11:44:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-17"}

It has been recently invented in Au/n-Si junctions, where\nmodulation of work function of the Au top electrode under contrasting\nillumination has been invoked to explain the effect. In this paper, a different\nphysical mechanism for energy harvesting from shadow-effect in a Schottky\njunction is proposed that does not assume change in work function of the top\nelectrode under illumination. The device, termed shadow-effect energy generator\n(SEG), is modelled as two parallel Schottky junction solar cells, one at the\nshadowed and the other at the illuminated part, connected with each other in a\nclosed loop circuit through the Si substrate and the top electrode. To test the\nproposed mechanism, ITO/n-Si junction based SEGs have been fabricated. The\nvalues of open circuit voltage in the SEGs have been found to be matching with\nthe difference of photovoltages of the two cells corrected for the potential\ndrop across the Si substrate, that validates the proposed mechanism. To further\ncorroborate the mechanism, the conventional SEG geometry has been modified by\napplying a continuous ohmic coating at the back of the Si substrates that\nbypasses the resistance of the Si substrate for current flow and results in\nhigher open circuit voltage and short circuit current. Moreover, ITO/n-Si based\nSEGs have been found to produce higher output power density compared to that\nreported in Au/n-Si devices in both the conventional and the new geometry.\nAlthough the closed loop present in the equivalent circuit of the SEG devices\nlead to wastage of harvested energy, the ITO/n-Si SEG devices can nevertheless\nbe used as self-powered sensor for light, object and movement detection as well\nas for producing electricity from contrasting illumination.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Sep 2020 12:04:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-09"}

Herein, the effect of various carbon defects\nin m-ZrO2 was investigated using the density functional theory to probe the\nthermodynamic, electronic, and optical properties of the defective structures\nagainst pristine m-ZrO2. The defect formation energies revealed that elevating\nthe temperature promotes and facilitates the formation of carbon defects.\nMoreover, the binding energies confirmed the stability of all studied complex\ncarbon defects. Furthermore, the band edge positions against the redox\npotentials of water species revealed that all the studied defective structures\ncan serve as photoanodes for water splitting. Additionally, CO3c (carbon atom\nsubstituted O3c site) was the only defective structure that exhibited slight\nstraddling of the redox potentials of water. Importantly, all investigated\ndefective structures enhanced light absorption with different optical\nactivities. Finally, CO3cVO3c (carbon atom substituted O3c associated with O3c\nvacancy) defective m-ZrO2 enjoyed low direct band gap (1.9 eV), low defect\nformation energy, low exciton binding energy, high mobility of charge carriers,\nfast charge transfer, and low recombination rate. Concurrently, its optical\nproperties were exceptional in terms of high absorption, low reflectivity and\nimproved static dielectric constant. Hence, the study recommends CO3cVO3c\ndefective m-ZrO2 as the leading candidate to serve as a photoanode for PEC\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Sep 2020 12:20:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-09"}

The most prominent example of such\ndata sharing platforms today are online social networks (OSNs). Many\nindividuals have multiple profiles in different OSNs, including anonymous and\nidentified ones (depending on the nature of the OSN). Here, the privacy threat\nis profile matching: if an attacker links anonymous profiles of individuals to\ntheir real identities, it can obtain privacy-sensitive information which may\nhave serious consequences, such as discrimination or blackmailing. Therefore,\nit is very important to quantify and show to the OSN users the extent of this\nprivacy risk. Existing attempts to model profile matching in OSNs are\ninadequate and computationally inefficient for real-time risk quantification.\nThus, in this work, we develop algorithms to efficiently model and quantify\nprofile matching attacks in OSNs as a step towards real-time privacy risk\nquantification. For this, we model the profile matching problem using a graph\nand develop a belief propagation (BP)-based algorithm to solve this problem in\na significantly more efficient and accurate way compared to the\nstate-of-the-art.

Nevertheless, since most existing GNN models are based on flat\nmessage-passing mechanisms, two limitations need to be tackled: (i) they are\ncostly in encoding long-range information spanning the graph structure; (ii)\nthey are failing to encode features in the high-order neighbourhood in the\ngraphs as they only perform information aggregation across the observed edges\nin the original graph. To deal with these two issues, we propose a novel\nHierarchical Message-passing Graph Neural Networks framework. The key idea is\ngenerating a hierarchical structure that re-organises all nodes in a flat graph\ninto multi-level super graphs, along with innovative intra- and inter-level\npropagation manners. The derived hierarchy creates shortcuts connecting\nfar-away nodes so that informative long-range interactions can be efficiently\naccessed via message passing and incorporates meso- and macro-level semantics\ninto the learned node representations. We present the first model to implement\nthis framework, termed Hierarchical Community-aware Graph Neural Network\n(HC-GNN), with the assistance of a hierarchical community detection algorithm.\nThe theoretical analysis illustrates HC-GNN's remarkable capacity in capturing\nlong-range information without introducing heavy additional computation\ncomplexity.

This\ndistribution is vital for studying multiple performance metrics such as the\ntrip efficiency, which we define as the fraction of the total trip spent on\ncharging roads. Next, we derive the probability that a given trip passes\nthrough at least one charging road. The derived probability distributions can\nbe used to assist urban planners and policy makers in designing the deployment\nplans of dynamic wireless charging systems. In addition, they can also be used\nby drivers and automobile manufacturers in choosing the best driving routes\ngiven the road conditions and level of energy of EV battery.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Sep 2020 13:20:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-09"}

Recent developments in zeroing control barrier\nfunctions (ZCBFs) have provided a framework for ensuring safety of a superlevel\nset of a single constraint function. Euler-Lagrange systems represent many\nreal-world systems including robots and vehicles, which must abide by\nsafety-regulations, especially for use in human-occupied environments. These\nsafety regulations include state constraints (position and velocity) and input\nconstraints that must be respected at all times. ZCBFs are valuable for\nsatisfying system constraints for general nonlinear systems, however their\nconstruction to satisfy state and input constraints is not straightforward.\nFurthermore, the existing barrier function methods do not address the multiple\nstate constraints that are required for safety of Euler-Lagrange systems. In\nthis paper, we propose a methodology to construct multiple, non-conflicting\ncontrol barrier functions for Euler-Lagrange systems subject to input\nconstraints to satisfy safety regulations, while concurrently taking into\naccount robustness margins and sampling-time effects. The proposed approach\nconsists of a sampled-data controller and an algorithm for barrier function\nconstruction to enforce safety (i.e satisfy position and velocity constraints).\nThe proposed method is validated in simulation on a 2-DOF planar manipulator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Sep 2020 13:55:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Aug 2021 17:14:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-05"}

This type of learning has two main challenges: the agents\ngenerally don't collect data over the same distribution, and the agents have\nlimited capabilities of storing and transmitting data. Therefore, it is\nimpractical for each agent to send the entire data over the network. Instead,\neach agent must form a local model and decide what information is fundamental\nto the learning problem, which will be sent to a central unit. The central unit\ncan then form the global model using only the information received from the\nagents. We propose a method that tackles these challenges. First each agent\nforms a local model using a low complexity reproducing kernel Hilbert space\nrepresentation. From the model the agents identify the fundamental samples\nwhich are sent to the central unit. The fundamental samples are obtained by\nsolving the dual problem. The central unit then forms the global model. We show\nthat the solution of the federated learner converges to that of the centralized\nlearner asymptotically as the sample size increases. The performance of the\nproposed algorithm is evaluated using experiments with both simulated data and\nreal data sets from an activity recognition task, for which the data is\ncollected from a wearable device.

Our main result\nis a structural theorem for graphs of bounded edge-admissibility. We prove that\nevery graph of edge-admissibility at most $k$ can be constructed using $(\\leq\nk)$-edge-sums, starting from graphs whose all vertices, except possibly from\none, have degree at most $k$.

In particular, a phenomenon known as\nzoombombing has emerged, in which aggressors join online meetings with the goal\nof disrupting them and harassing their participants. In this paper, we conduct\nthe first data-driven analysis of calls for zoombombing attacks on social\nmedia. We identify ten popular online meeting tools and extract posts\ncontaining meeting invitations to these platforms on a mainstream social\nnetwork, Twitter, and on a fringe community known for organizing coordinated\nattacks against online users, 4chan. We then perform manual annotation to\nidentify posts that are calling for zoombombing attacks, and apply thematic\nanalysis to develop a codebook to better characterize the discussion\nsurrounding calls for zoombombing. During the first seven months of 2020, we\nidentify over 200 calls for zoombombing between Twitter and 4chan, and analyze\nthese calls both quantitatively and qualitatively. Our findings indicate that\nthe vast majority of calls for zoombombing are not made by attackers stumbling\nupon meeting invitations or bruteforcing their meeting ID, but rather by\ninsiders who have legitimate access to these meetings, particularly students in\nhigh school and college classes. This has important security implications,\nbecause it makes common protections against zoombombing, such as password\nprotection, ineffective. We also find instances of insiders instructing\nattackers to adopt the names of legitimate participants in the class to avoid\ndetection, making countermeasures like setting up a waiting room and vetting\nparticipants less effective.

In particular, for $N=2$, starting in the surface phase with\nquasi-long-range order and approaching the bulk phase transition, the stiffness\nof the surface order parameter diverges logarithmically. For $N > N_c$ there is\nno fixed point with order parameter correlations decaying slower than power\nlaw; we discuss two scenarios for the evolution of the phase diagram past $N =\nN_c$. Our findings appear to be consistent with recent Monte-Carlo studies of\nclassical models with $N = 2$ and $N = 3$. We also compare our results to\nnumerical studies of boundary criticality in 2+1D quantum spin models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Sep 2020 18:28:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Oct 2021 23:07:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-05"}

In the\nfight against this novel disease, there is a pressing need for rapid and\neffective screening tools to identify patients infected with COVID-19, and to\nthis end CT imaging has been proposed as one of the key screening methods which\nmay be used as a complement to RT-PCR testing, particularly in situations where\npatients undergo routine CT scans for non-COVID-19 related reasons, patients\nwith worsening respiratory status or developing complications that require\nexpedited care, and patients suspected to be COVID-19-positive but have\nnegative RT-PCR test results. Motivated by this, in this study we introduce\nCOVIDNet-CT, a deep convolutional neural network architecture that is tailored\nfor detection of COVID-19 cases from chest CT images via a machine-driven\ndesign exploration approach. Additionally, we introduce COVIDx-CT, a benchmark\nCT image dataset derived from CT imaging data collected by the China National\nCenter for Bioinformation comprising 104,009 images across 1,489 patient cases.\nFurthermore, in the interest of reliability and transparency, we leverage an\nexplainability-driven performance validation strategy to investigate the\ndecision-making behaviour of COVIDNet-CT, and in doing so ensure that\nCOVIDNet-CT makes predictions based on relevant indicators in CT images. Both\nCOVIDNet-CT and the COVIDx-CT dataset are available to the general public in an\nopen-source and open access manner as part of the COVID-Net initiative. While\nCOVIDNet-CT is not yet a production-ready screening solution, we hope that\nreleasing the model and dataset will encourage researchers, clinicians, and\ncitizen data scientists alike to leverage and build upon them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Sep 2020 15:49:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-14"}

In this work, we study the predictability of different structural\ndescriptors via both linear regressions and neural networks. A large data set\nof 30,000 virtual, porous microstructures of different types is created for\nthis end. We compute permeabilities of these structures using the lattice\nBoltzmann method, and characterize the pore space geometry using one-point\ncorrelation functions (porosity, specific surface), two-point surface-surface,\nsurface-void, and void-void correlation functions, as well as the geodesic\ntortuosity as an implicit descriptor. Then, we study the prediction of the\npermeability using different combinations of these descriptors. We obtain\nsignificant improvements of performance when compared to a Kozeny-Carman\nregression with only lowest-order descriptors (porosity and specific surface).\nWe find that combining all three two-point correlation functions and tortuosity\nprovides the best prediction of permeability, with the void-void correlation\nfunction being the most informative individual descriptor. Moreover, the\ncombination of porosity, specific surface, and geodesic tortuosity provides\nvery good predictive performance.
