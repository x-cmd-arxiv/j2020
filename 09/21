Earlier work\nabout probability distributions by Vorob'ev (1962) and about database relations\nby Beeri, Fagin, Maier, Yannakakis (1983) produced characterizations of when\nlocal consistency always implies global consistency. Towards a common\ngeneralization of these results, we consider K-relations, that is, relations\nover a set of attributes such that each tuple in the relation is associated\nwith an element from an arbitrary, but fixed, positive semiring K. We introduce\nthe notions of projection of a K-relation, consistency of two K-relations, and\nglobal consistency of a collection of K-relations; these notions are natural\nextensions of the corresponding notions about probability distributions and\ndatabase relations. We then show that a collection of sets of attributes has\nthe property that every pairwise consistent collection of K-relations over\nthose attributes is globally consistent if and only if the sets of attributes\nform an acyclic hypergraph. This generalizes the aforementioned results by\nVorob'ev and by Beeri et al., and demonstrates that K-relations over positive\nsemirings constitute a natural framework for the study of the interplay between\nlocal and global consistency. In the course of the proof, we introduce a notion\nof join of two K-relations and argue that it is the \"right\" generalization of\nthe join of two database relations. Furthermore, to show that non-acyclic\nhypergraphs yield pairwise consistent K-relations that are globally\ninconsistent, we generalize a construction by Tseitin (1968) in his study of\nhard-to-prove tautologies in propositional logic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Sep 2020 18:12:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-22"}

In this domain, learning algorithms must\nnot only be able to handle massive volumes of rapidly arriving data, but also\nadapt themselves to potential emerging changes. The phenomenon of the evolving\nnature of data streams is known as concept drift. While there is a plethora of\nmethods designed for detecting its occurrence, all of them assume that the\ndrift is connected with underlying changes in the source of data. However, one\nmust consider the possibility of a malicious injection of false data that\nsimulates a concept drift. This adversarial setting assumes a poisoning attack\nthat may be conducted in order to damage the underlying classification system\nby forcing adaptation to false data. Existing drift detectors are not capable\nof differentiating between real and adversarial concept drift. In this paper,\nwe propose a framework for robust concept drift detection in the presence of\nadversarial and poisoning attacks. We introduce the taxonomy for two types of\nadversarial concept drifts, as well as a robust trainable drift detector. It is\nbased on the augmented Restricted Boltzmann Machine with improved gradient\ncomputation and energy function. We also introduce Relative Loss of Robustness\n- a novel measure for evaluating the performance of concept drift detectors\nunder poisoning attacks. Extensive computational experiments, conducted on both\nfully and sparsely labeled data streams, prove the high robustness and efficacy\nof the proposed drift detection framework in adversarial scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Sep 2020 18:46:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-22"}

We consider an online setting where costs at each time are revealed\nonly after the controller at that time is chosen. We propose an iterative\napproach to the synthesis of the controller by solving a modified discrete-time\nRiccati equation. Solutions of this equation enforce the safety constraint. We\ncompare the cost of this controller with that of the optimal controller when\none has complete knowledge of disturbances and costs in hindsight. We show that\nthe regret function, which is defined as the difference between these costs,\nvaries logarithmically with the time horizon. We validate our approach on a\nprocess control setup that is subject to two kinds of adversarial attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Sep 2020 19:59:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-22"}

In this study, the Venables distance (D_v), and the activity density\n(D_a) are used to quantify and evaluate human activities for 193 US counties,\nwhose cumulative number of confirmed cases was greater than 100 as of March 31,\n2020. Venables distance provides a measure of the agglomeration of the level of\nhuman activities based on the average distance of human activities across a\ncity or a county (less distance could lead to a greater contact risk). Activity\ndensity provides a measure of level of overall activity level in a county or a\ncity (more activity could lead to a greater risk). Accordingly, Pearson\ncorrelation analysis is used to examine the relationship between the two human\nactivity indicators and the basic reproduction number in the following weeks.\nThe results show statistically significant correlations between the indicators\nof human activities and the basic reproduction number in all counties, as well\nas a significant leader-follower relationship (time lag) between them. The\nresults also show one to two weeks' lag between the change in activity\nindicators and the decrease in the basic reproduction number. This result\nimplies that the human activity indicators provide effective early indicators\nfor the spread risk of the pandemic during the early stages of the outbreak.\nHence, the results could be used by the authorities to proactively assess the\nrisk of disease spread by monitoring the daily Venables distance and activity\ndensity in a proactive manner.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Sep 2020 20:12:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-22"}

Using NDN as an underlying protocol, end-user devices (e.g. IoT\ndevice and smart phone) formulate a multi-hop (mesh) network, in which certain\ndevices play a role of forwarding packets for others and/or act as gateways to\naccess the Internet. Nevertheless, an autonomous (selfish) node in an ad-hoc\nnetwork has two disincentives for forwarding packets for others: energy\nexpenditure and possible delays for its own data. This paper introduces\nPrice-based Path-specified Transport Protocol (PPT) for NDN, using blockchain\nas a payment platform to support money transfers between autonomous nodes thus\nto incentivise packet forwarding. In PPTP, routers advertise their expected\nprices for packet forwarding and consumers estimate the costs and select the\nappropriate paths for content downloading. PPTP is still an on-going project\ntherefore this paper will present the design principle and planed functions,\nand show how PPTP are related to other existing blockchain-based networking\nsolutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Sep 2020 21:38:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-22"}

We adopt an Iterative Risk Allocation\n(IRA) formalism, which uses a two-stage approach to solve the optimal risk\nallocation problem for covariance steering. The upper-stage of IRA optimizes\nthe risk, which is proved to be a convex problem, while the lower-stage\noptimizes the controller with the new constraints. This is done iteratively so\nas to find the optimal risk allocation that achieves the lowest total cost. The\nproposed framework results in solutions that tend to maximize the terminal\ncovariance, while still satisfying the chance constraints, thus leading to less\nconservative solutions than previous methodologies.

In this paper, we propose two\nkinds of min-entropy estimators to improve computational complexity and\nestimation accuracy by leveraging two variations of Maurer's test: Coron's test\n(for Shannon entropy) and Kim's test (for Renyi entropy). First, we propose a\nmin-entropy estimator based on Coron's test. It is computationally more\nefficient than the compression estimator while maintaining the estimation\naccuracy. The secondly proposed estimator relies on Kim's test that computes\nthe Renyi entropy. This estimator improves estimation accuracy as well as\ncomputational complexity. We analytically characterize the bias-variance\ntradeoff, which depends on the order of Renyi entropy.

In the case of ferromagnetic insulators, it is well\nknown that Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction can induce magnon thermal\nHall effect. Specifically, the DM vector parallel to the magnetization\ndirection induces complex magnon hopping amplitudes, so that magnons act as if\nthey feel Lorentz force. However, the DM vector which is orthogonal to the\nmagnetization direction has hitherto been neglected as a possible source of\nmagnon thermal Hall effect. This is because they play no role in the linear\nspin wave theory, an often invoked approximation when computing the magnon\nthermal Hall effect. Here, we challenge this expectation by presenting the\nself-consistent Schwinger-boson mean field study of two-dimensional magnets\nwith ferromagnetic Heisenberg interaction and in-plane DM interaction. We find\nthat the relevant Schwinger-boson mean field Hamiltonian takes the form of\ntwo-dimensional electron gas with Rashba spin-orbit interaction, which is known\nto show anomalous Hall effect, spin Hall effect, and Rashba-Edelstein effect,\nwhose thermal counterparts also appear in our system. Importantly, the thermal\nHall effect can be induced when out-of-plane magnetic field is applied, and\npersists even when the magnetic field is large, so that the spins are\nsignificantly polarized, and the linear spin wave theory is expected to be a\nreasonable approximation. Since the linear spin wave theory predicts vanishing\nthermal Hall effect, our result implies that linear spin wave is not a\nsufficient approximation, and that magnon-magnon interaction must be taken into\naccount to predict the correct thermal Hall conductivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Sep 2020 05:44:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-04"}

Not only are there no known\nfirst-order methods converging even to approximate local min-max points, but\nthe computational complexity of identifying them is also poorly understood. In\nthis paper, we provide a characterization of the computational complexity of\nthe problem, as well as of the limitations of first-order methods in\nconstrained min-max optimization problems with nonconvex-nonconcave objectives\nand linear constraints.\n  As a warm-up, we show that, even when the objective is a Lipschitz and smooth\ndifferentiable function, deciding whether a min-max point exists, in fact even\ndeciding whether an approximate min-max point exists, is NP-hard. More\nimportantly, we show that an approximate local min-max point of large enough\napproximation is guaranteed to exist, but finding one such point is\nPPAD-complete. The same is true of computing an approximate fixed point of\nGradient Descent/Ascent.\n  An important byproduct of our proof is to establish an unconditional hardness\nresult in the Nemirovsky-Yudin model.

In\nthis work, we propose a novel nonlinear Deep Encoder-Decoder framework to\ncapture the cross-domain information for mixed data types. The hidden layers of\nthe network connect the two types of variables through various non-linear\ntransformations to give latent feature maps.

One\napproach is inverse quantitative structure activity/property relationship\n(inverse QSAR/QSPR) analysis, which is to infer chemical structures from given\nchemical activities/properties. Recently, a framework has been proposed for\ninverse QSAR/QSPR using artificial neural networks (ANN) and mixed integer\nlinear programming (MILP). This method consists of a prediction phase and an\ninverse prediction phase. In the first phase, a feature vector $f(G)$ of a\nchemical graph $G$ is introduced and a prediction function $\\psi$ on a chemical\nproperty $\\pi$ is constructed with an ANN. In the second phase, given a target\nvalue $y^*$ of property $\\pi$, a feature vector $x^*$ is inferred by solving an\nMILP formulated from the trained ANN so that $\\psi(x^*)$ is close to $y^*$ and\nthen a set of chemical structures $G^*$ such that $f(G^*)= x^*$ is enumerated\nby a graph search algorithm. The framework has been applied to the case of\nchemical compounds with cycle index up to 2. The computational results\nconducted on instances with $n$ non-hydrogen atoms show that a feature vector\n$x^*$ can be inferred for up to around $n=40$ whereas graphs $G^*$ can be\nenumerated for up to $n=15$.

The results of computational experiments using\nproperties such as octanol/water partition coefficient, boiling point and heat\nof combustion suggest that the proposed method can infer chemical acyclic\ngraphs $G^*$ with $n=50$ and diameter 30.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Sep 2020 07:11:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-22"}

Presently, the aircraft development process is cross\norganizational, and harnesses distributed, heterogeneous knowledge and\nexpertise. Large scale multidisciplinary studies, involving disciplinary\nexperts and specific tools are required to evaluate different aircraft\nconcepts. These MultiDisciplinary Aircraft Optimization (MDAO) processes are\ndifficult to deploy as they involve cross-organizational collaboration and\nharmonization of processes, tools and even vocabulary. Moreover, difficulties\nin collaborative decision making, reconfiguration and integration of new\nrequirements and competencies often precludes the development of an optimal\nsolution within the available time. To address these challenges, the AGILE\nproject is an effort within the European Union funded Horizon 2020 project to\nreduce aircraft development time by developing tools and processes that enable\nefficient, collaborative aircraft design. This paper presents the work\nperformed as part of the AGILE academy challenge where students were tasked\nwith developing and solving an aircraft MDAO problem using the AGILE toolchain.\nEach team consisted of students from various universities around the globe and\nhad expertise in multiple design domains. An MDAO study is presented that\nutilizes the AGILE toolchain to investigate the feasibility of implementing an\nauxiliary solar power system on a baseline aircraft. The steps performed are:\n(1) definition of a multidisciplinary design problem, (2) development of\ncollaborative workflow and (3) optimization using surrogate models. Through the\ncase study, a novel technology concept is investigated and the efficacy of the\nAGILE toolchain in facilitating a MDAO is analyzed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Sep 2020 07:33:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-22"}

However, with\nthe remarkable progress of the convolutional neural network, recent\nstate-of-the-art approaches are proposed to solve problems directly on\nfeature-level. Since the displacement of feature vector is not consistent to\nthe pixel displacement, a common approach is to:forward optical flow to a\nneural network and fine-tune this network on the task dataset.

However, existing\nsegmentation-based trackers are ineffective in learning the spatio-temporal\ncorrespondence across frames due to no use of the rich temporal information. To\novercome this issue, this paper presents a novel segmentation-based tracking\narchitecture, which is equipped with a spatio-appearance memory network to\nlearn accurate spatio-temporal correspondence. Among it, an appearance memory\nnetwork explores spatio-temporal non-local similarity to learn the dense\ncorrespondence between the segmentation mask and the current frame. Meanwhile,\na spatial memory network is modeled as discriminative correlation filter to\nlearn the mapping between feature map and spatial map.

Since interaction is a key component in both reinforcement\nlearning and social robotics, it can be a well-suited approach for real-world\ninteractions with physically embodied social robots. The scope of the paper is\nfocused particularly on studies that include social physical robots and\nreal-world human-robot interactions with users. We present a thorough analysis\nof reinforcement learning approaches in social robotics. In addition to a\nsurvey, we categorize existent reinforcement learning approaches based on the\nused method and the design of the reward mechanisms. Moreover, since\ncommunication capability is a prominent feature of social robots, we discuss\nand group the papers based on the communication medium used for reward\nformulation. Considering the importance of designing the reward function, we\nalso provide a categorization of the papers based on the nature of the reward.\nThis categorization includes three major themes: interactive reinforcement\nlearning, intrinsically motivated methods, and task performance-driven methods.\nThe benefits and challenges of reinforcement learning in social robotics,\nevaluation methods of the papers regarding whether or not they use subjective\nand algorithmic measures, a discussion in the view of real-world reinforcement\nlearning challenges and proposed solutions, the points that remain to be\nexplored, including the approaches that have thus far received less attention\nis also given in the paper.

Accordingly, in this work, we\npropose a simple framework named Batch Coherence-Driven Network (BCD-Net) that\nbypasses body part detection during both the training and testing phases while\nstill learning semantically aligned part features. Our key observation is that\nthe statistics in a batch of images are stable, and therefore that batch-level\nconstraints are robust. First, we introduce a batch coherence-guided channel\nattention (BCCA) module that highlights the relevant channels for each\nrespective part from the output of a deep backbone model. We investigate\nchannelpart correspondence using a batch of training images, then impose a\nnovel batch-level supervision signal that helps BCCA to identify part-relevant\nchannels. Second, the mean position of a body part is robust and consequently\ncoherent between batches throughout the training process. Accordingly, we\nintroduce a pair of regularization terms based on the semantic consistency\nbetween batches. The first term regularizes the high responses of BCD-Net for\neach part on one batch in order to constrain it within a predefined area, while\nthe second encourages the aggregate of BCD-Nets responses for all parts\ncovering the entire human body.

While partially\nobservable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) provide a natural model for such\nproblems, reward functions that directly penalize uncertainty in the agent's\nbelief can remove the piecewise-linear and convex property of the value\nfunction required by most POMDP planners. Furthermore, as the number of sensors\navailable to the agent grows, the computational cost of POMDP planning grows\nexponentially with it, making POMDP planning infeasible with traditional\nmethods. In this article, we address a twofold challenge of modeling and\nplanning for active perception tasks. We show the mathematical equivalence of\n$\\rho$POMDP and POMDP-IR, two frameworks for modeling active perception tasks,\nthat restore the PWLC property of the value function. To efficiently plan for\nactive perception tasks, we identify and exploit the independence properties of\nPOMDP-IR to reduce the computational cost of solving POMDP-IR (and\n$\\rho$POMDP). We propose greedy point-based value iteration (PBVI), a new POMDP\nplanning method that uses greedy maximization to greatly improve scalability in\nthe action space of an active perception POMDP. Furthermore, we show that,\nunder certain conditions, including submodularity, the value function computed\nusing greedy PBVI is guaranteed to have bounded error with respect to the\noptimal value function. We establish the conditions under which the value\nfunction of an active perception POMDP is guaranteed to be submodular. Finally,\nwe present a detailed empirical analysis on a dataset collected from a\nmulti-camera tracking system employed in a shopping mall. Our method achieves\nsimilar performance to existing methods but at a fraction of the computational\ncost leading to better scalability for solving active perception tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Sep 2020 09:11:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-22"}

There exists a target set containing one or multiple\ndifferent structures. Our proposed methods can find an optimal path from a\nstart structure to a single target structure, or optimize the processing paths\nto one of the equivalent target-structures in the set. In the latter case, the\nalgorithm learns during processing to simultaneously identify the best\nreachable target structure and the optimal path to it.

Recently, channel pruning has become one of the predominant\ncompression methods to deploy deep models on resource-constrained devices. Most\nchannel pruning methods often use a fixed compression rate for all the layers\nof the model, which, however, may not be optimal. To address this issue, given\na target compression rate for the whole model, one can search for the optimal\ncompression rate for each layer. Nevertheless, these methods perform channel\npruning for a specific target compression rate. When we consider multiple\ncompression rates, they have to repeat the channel pruning process multiple\ntimes, which is very inefficient yet unnecessary. To address this issue, we\npropose a Conditional Automated Channel Pruning(CACP) method to obtain the\ncompressed models with different compression rates through single channel\npruning process. To this end, we develop a conditional model that takes an\narbitrary compression rate as input and outputs the corresponding compressed\nmodel.

Many of these studies\nfocused on reporting initial results of algorithms that were assembled from\ncommonly used components. The choice of these components was often pragmatic\nrather than systematic. For instance, several studies used 2D CNNs even though\nthese might not be optimal for handling 3D CT volumes. This paper identifies a\nvariety of components that increase the performance of CNN-based algorithms for\nCOVID-19 grading from CT images. We investigated the effectiveness of using a\n3D CNN instead of a 2D CNN, of using transfer learning to initialize the\nnetwork, of providing automatically computed lesion maps as additional network\ninput, and of predicting a continuous instead of a categorical output. A 3D CNN\nwith these components achieved an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.934 on\nour test set of 105 CT scans and an AUC of 0.923 on a publicly available set of\n742 CT scans, a substantial improvement in comparison with a previously\npublished 2D CNN.

The prototype\nimplemented by using FPGA is an out-of-box solution without modifying commodity\ndevices such as NICs or switches.

The\nfaithfulness assumption is a principle of parsimony, and the intuition behind\nit is basic and compelling: when no statistical correlation exists between the\noccurrences of a pair of events, we have no reason for supposing there to be a\ncausal connection between them. This paper is an attempt to undermine the\nreasonableness of the assumption of faithfulness in the quantum context.\nEmploying a symmetry relation between an entangled bipartite quantum system and\na `sideways' quantum system consisting of a single photon passing sequentially\nthrough two polarisers, I argue that Wood and Spekkens' analysis applies\nequally to this sideways system.

RX Boo shows strong and fast variations in the intensity of the\ndifferent spectral features of the SiO lines at 7 mm and 3 mm.

An appropriate statistical modelling, adapted to the time series'\ncomplex nature, is however still lacking. In this work, we provide the first\ncomprehensive uncertainty quantification analysis of sunspot counts. Our\ninterest lies in the following three components: the number of spots ($N_s$),\nthe number of sunspot groups ($N_g$), and the composite $N_c$, defined as\n$N_c:=N_s+10N_g$. Those are reported by a network of observatories around the\nworld, and are corrupted by errors of various types. We use a multiplicative\nframework to provide, for each of the three components, an estimation of their\nerror distribution in various regimes (short-term, long-term, minima of solar\nactivity). We also propose a robust estimator for the underlying solar signal\nand fit a density distribution that takes into account intrinsic\ncharacteristics such as over-dispersion, excess of zeros, and multiple modes.\nThe estimation of the solar signal underlying the composite $N_c$ may be seen\nas a robust version of the International Sunspot Number (ISN), a quantity\nwidely used as a proxy of solar activity. Therefore our results on $N_c$ may\nserve to characterize the uncertainty on ISN as well. Our results paves the way\nfor a future monitoring of the observatories in quasi-real time, with the aim\nto alert the observers when they start deviating from the network and prevent\nlarge drifts from occurring in the network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Sep 2020 12:31:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-22"}

One of the cleanest observable of\nsuch kind is the electric dipole moment (EDM), since Standard Model estimates\nwould imply very small, much less then 10^-30 ecm value for that quantity,\nwhereas several Beyond Standard Model (BSM) theories happen to predict of the\norder of 10^-28 ecm EDM for elementary or hadronic particles. So far, precision\nEDM upper bounds are mainly available for neutrons via cold neutron\nexperiments, and indirect measurements for electrons. Therefore, in the recent\nyear there has been a growing interest for direct measurement of EDM for\ncharged particles, such as electrons, protons, muons or light nuclei. Such\nmeasurements become possible in relativistic storage rings, called frozen spin\nstorage rings. Many environmental factors give systematic backgrounds to the\nEDM signal, including General Relativity (GR), due to the gravitational field\nof the Earth. It turns out that, depending of the experimental scenario, the GR\neffect can be well above the planned EDM sensitivity. Therefore, it is both of\nconcern as a source of systematics, as well as it can serve as a spin-off\nexperiment for an independent test of GR. There are a handful of theoretical\npapers quantifying the GR systematics, delivering slightly different results.\nThe aim of this paper is to clarify these claims, eventually try to reconcile\nthese predictions, and to deduce their experimental implications.

Unfortunately, existing studies that propose various approaches, in\nfighting against DeepFake and determining if the facial image is real or fake,\nis still at an early stage. Obviously, the current DeepFake detection method\nstruggles to catch the rapid progress of GANs, especially in the adversarial\nscenarios where attackers can evade the detection intentionally, such as adding\nperturbations to fool the DNN-based detectors. While passive detection simply\ntells whether the image is fake or real, DeepFake provenance, on the other\nhand, provides clues for tracking the sources in DeepFake forensics. Thus, the\ntracked fake images could be blocked immediately by administrators and avoid\nfurther spread in social networks.\n  In this paper, we investigate the potentials of image tagging in serving the\nDeepFake provenance tracking. Specifically, we devise a deep learning-based\napproach, named FakeTagger, with a simple yet effective encoder and decoder\ndesign along with channel coding to embed message to the facial image, which is\nto recover the embedded message after various drastic GAN-based DeepFake\ntransformation with high confidence.

We hence construct\none- and two-zone photoionization models accounting for the observed LyC\nescape, which we compare to the observed emission line measurements. We find\nthat one-zone density-bounded photoionization models cannot reproduce the\nemission lines of the LyC leakers because they systematically underpredict the\nlines of species of low ionization potential, as [OI] and [SII]. Introducing a\ntwo-zone model, with differing ionization parameter and a variable covering\nfraction and where one of the zones is density-bounded, we show that the\nobserved emission line ratios and escape fractions of the LyC emitters are well\nreproduced. The [OI] excess, which is observed in some LyC leakers, can be\nnaturally explained in this model, e.g., by emission from low-ionization and\nlow-filling-factor gas. LyC emitters with a high escape fraction (fesc > 38%)\nare deficient both in [OI]6300A and in [SII]6716,6731A. We also confirm that a\n[SII] deficiency can be used to select LyC emitter candidates. Finally, we find\nindications for a possible dichotomy in terms of escape mechanisms for LyC\nphotons between galaxies with relatively low (fesc < 10%) and higher escape\nfractions. We conclude that two-zone photoionization models are sufficient and\nrequired to explain the observed emission line properties of z - 0.3-0.4 LyC\nemitters.

At the core of the paradox lies the description of an observer and\nthe object it measures as a closed system obeying the Schr\\\"odinger equation.\nWe revisit this assumption to derive a necessary condition on a quantum system\nto behave as an observer.

Recent works proposed to transfer the robustness\nto adversarial attacks across different tasks or models with soft\nlabels.Compared to soft labels, feature contains rich semantic information and\nholds the potential to be applied to different downstream tasks. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel approach called Guided Adversarial Contrastive Distillation\n(GACD), to effectively transfer adversarial robustness from teacher to student\nwith features.

With a well-trained teacher model as an\nanchor, students are expected to extract features similar to the teacher.

By extensive experiments evaluating over\npopular datasets such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and STL-10, we demonstrate that\nour approach can effectively transfer robustness across different models and\neven different tasks, and achieve comparable or better results than existing\nmethods.

A recent planning approach, CMAX, tackles this problem\nby adapting the planner online during execution to bias the resulting plans\naway from inaccurately modeled regions. CMAX, while being provably guaranteed\nto reach the goal, requires strong assumptions on the accuracy of the model\nused for planning and fails to improve the quality of the solution over\nrepetitions of the same task. In this paper we propose CMAX++, an approach that\nleverages real-world experience to improve the quality of resulting plans over\nsuccessive repetitions of a robotic task. CMAX++ achieves this by integrating\nmodel-free learning using acquired experience with model-based planning using\nthe potentially inaccurate model. We provide provable guarantees on the\ncompleteness and asymptotic convergence of CMAX++ to the optimal path cost as\nthe number of repetitions increases.

In this paper, we develop and compare a vector Kalman filter\n(VKF)-based channel predictor and a machine learning (ML)-based channel\npredictor using the realistic channels from the spatial channel model (SCM),\nwhich has been adopted in the 3GPP standard for years. First, we propose a\nlow-complexity mobility estimator based on the spatial average using a large\nnumber of antennas in massive MIMO. The mobility estimate can be used to\ndetermine the complexity order of developed predictors. The VKF-based channel\npredictor developed in this paper exploits the autoregressive (AR) parameters\nestimated from the SCM channels based on the Yule-Walker equations. Then, the\nML-based channel predictor using the linear minimum mean square error\n(LMMSE)-based noise pre-processed data is developed. Numerical results reveal\nthat both channel predictors have substantial gain over the outdated channel in\nterms of the channel prediction accuracy and data rate. The ML-based predictor\nhas larger overall computational complexity than the VKF-based predictor, but\nonce trained, the operational complexity of ML-based predictor becomes smaller\nthan that of VKF-based predictor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Sep 2020 15:47:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-28"}

The computational complexity of the Monte Carlo method relies on\nthe continuous frame being so called linear volume discretizable (LVD). The LVD\nproperty means that the number of samples in the coefficient space required by\nthe Monte Carlo method is proportional to the resolution of the discrete\nsignal. We show in this paper that the continuous wavelet transform (CWT) and\nthe localizing time-frequency transform (LTFT) are LVD. The LTFT is a\ntime-frequency representation based on a 3D time-frequency space with a richer\nclass of time-frequency atoms than classical time-frequency transforms like the\nshort time Fourier transform (STFT) and the CWT. Our analysis proves that\nperforming signal processing with the LTFT has the same asymptotic complexity\nas signal processing with the STFT and CWT (based on FFT), even though the\ncoefficient space of the LTFT is higher dimensional.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Sep 2020 20:08:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Oct 2021 18:55:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-11"}

Recently, it is explained that the overfitting happens\nbecause the sample complexity of training data is insufficient to generalize\nrobustness. In traditional machine learning, one way to relieve overfitting\nfrom the lack of data is to use ensemble methods. However, adversarial training\nmultiple networks is extremely expensive. Moreover, we found that there is a\ndilemma on choosing target model to generate adversarial examples. Optimizing\nattack to the members of ensemble will be suboptimal attack to the ensemble and\nincurs covariate shift, while attack to ensemble will weaken the members and\nlose the benefit from ensembling. In this paper, we propose adversarial\ntraining with Stochastic weight average (SWA); while performing adversarial\ntraining, we aggregate the temporal weight states in the trajectory of\ntraining. By adopting SWA, the benefit of ensemble can be gained without\ntremendous computational increment and without facing the dilemma. Moreover, we\nfurther improved SWA to be adequate to adversarial training.

Two--dimensional ferroelectric CuInP$_2$S$_6$\nis analyzed in detail as a typical example, but the theory can be applied to\nall other low--dimensional piezoelectrics. Similar to three--dimensional\npiezoelectrics with negative piezoelectric responses, the anomalous negative\npiezoelectricity in CuInP$_2$S$_6$ results from its negative clamped--ion term,\nwhich cannot be compensated by the positive internal strain part. Here, we\npropose a more general rule that having a negative clamped--ion term should be\nuniversal among piezoelectric materials, which is attributed to the \"lag of\nWannier center\" effect. The internal--strain term, which is the change in\npolarization due to structural relaxation in response to strain, is mostly\ndetermined by the spatial structure and chemical bonding of the material. In a\nlow--dimensional piezoelectric material as CuInP$_2$S$_6$, the internal--strain\nterm is approximately zero. This is because the internal structure of the\nmolecular layers, which are bonded by the weak van der Waals interaction,\nresponds little to the strain. As a result, the magnitude of the dipole, which\ndepends strongly on the dimension and structure of the molecular layer, also\nhas a small response with respect to strain. An equation bridging the internal\nstrain responses in low--dimensional and three--dimensional piezoelectrics is\nalso derived to analytically express this point.

In this sense,\npersonalized services such as recommender systems play a crucial role in\ndecision making. Two traditional recommendation techniques are content-based\nand collaborative filtering. While both methods have their advantages, they\nalso have certain disadvantages, some of which can be solved by combining both\ntechniques to improve the quality of the recommendation. The resulting system\nis known as a hybrid recommender system. This paper presents a new hybrid hotel\nrecommendation system that has been developed by combining content-based and\ncollaborative filtering approaches that recommends customer the hotel they need\nand save them from time loss.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Sep 2020 09:57:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-30"}

However, many\ntracking systems struggle to perform in real-time due to the high computational\ncost of detecting people, especially in ultra high resolution images. We\npropose a new algorithm called \\emph{PartiMax} that greatly reduces this cost\nby applying the person detector only to the relevant parts of the image.\nPartiMax exploits information in the particle filter to select $k$ of the $n$\ncandidate \\emph{pixel boxes} in the image. We prove that PartiMax is guaranteed\nto make a near-optimal selection with error bounds that are independent of the\nproblem size. Furthermore, empirical results on a real-life dataset show that\nour system runs in real-time by processing only 10\\% of the pixel boxes in the\nimage while still retaining 80\\% of the original tracking performance achieved\nwhen processing all pixel boxes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Sep 2020 08:29:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-08"}

These rules have\nbeen implemented on a multi-agent system for creating simple logic functions,\nthat establish a base for building up more complex systems and architectures.\nResults in a simulation environment showed that for a given set of parameters\nit is possible to reach topologies that reproduce the tested functions.\n  This project also opens the door to the usage of techniques like genetic\nalgorithms for obtaining the best suited values for the model parameters, and\nhence creating neural networks that can adapt to different functions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Sep 2020 15:11:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-29"}

Progress on topological photonic\ncrystals shows potential to improve integrated terahertz systems that suffer\nfrom high losses around sharp bends. Robust terahertz topological transport\nthrough sharp bends on a silicon chip has been recently reported over a\nrelatively narrow bandwidth. Here, we report the experimental demonstration of\ntopological terahertz planar air-channel metallic waveguides which can be\nintegrated into an on-chip interconnect. Our platform can be fabricated by a\nsimple, cost-effective technique combining 3D-printing and gold-sputtering. The\nrelative size of the measured topological bandgap is ~12.5%, which entails\nsignificant improvement over all-silicon terahertz topological waveguides\n(~7.8%).

Our work provides a promising path towards compact integrated terahertz\ndevices as a next frontier for terahertz wireless communications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Sep 2020 06:56:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-02"}
