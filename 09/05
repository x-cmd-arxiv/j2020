Bott periodicity appears in the\nform of a generalized Dirac monopole built out of a given phase, which is\nequivalent to the product of a Dirac monopole phase with that same given phase.\nThe complex K-theory cohomology ring is presented as a natural way to store the\ninformation of these phases, with a grading corresponding to the number of\nClifford symmetries modulo $2$. The K\\\"unneth formula allows us to derive the\nresult that, for band insulators, the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain in one\ndimension allows one to generate the K-cohomology of the $d$-dimensional\nBrillouin zone.

These objects were\nfirst classified according to their emission line features into flat-spectrum\nradio quasars (FSRQs) and BL Lacertae objects (BL Lacs). More recently,\nobservations revealed a trend between these objects known as the \\emph{blazar\nsequence}, along with an anti-correlation between the observed power and the\nfrequency of the synchrotron peak. In the present work, we propose a fairly\nsimple idea that could account for the whole blazar population: all jets are\nlaunched with similar energy per baryon, independently of their power. In the\ncase of FSRQs, the most powerful jets, manage to accelerate to high bulk\nLorentz factors, as observed in the radio. As a result, they have a rather\nmodest magnetization in the emission region, resulting in magnetic reconnection\ninjecting a steep particle energy distribution and, consequently, steep\nemission spectra in the $\\gamma$-rays. For the weaker jets, namely BL Lacs, the\nopposite holds true; i.e., the jet does not achieve a very high bulk Lorentz\nfactor, leading to more magnetic energy available for non-thermal particle\nacceleration, and harder emission spectra at frequencies $\\gtrsim$ GeV. In this\nscenario, we recover all observable properties of blazars with our simulations,\nincluding the \\emph{blazar sequence} for models with mild baryon loading ($50\n\\lesssim \\mu \\lesssim 80$). This interpretation of the blazar population,\ntherefore, tightly constrains the energy per baryon of blazar jets regardless\nof their accretion rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Sep 2020 16:10:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Jan 2021 20:41:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-08"}

Moreover,\ninformation about the primordial non-Gaussian signal lies also in higher-order\ncorrelations. Without tapping into these, that information remains hidden.\nWhile the three-point function (or the bispectrum), even if not extensively,\nhas been studied and applied to data, there has been only limited discussion\nabout the four point/trispectrum. This is because the high-dimensionality of\nthe statistics (in real space a skew-quadrilateral has 6 degrees of freedom),\nand the high number of skew-quadrilaterals, make the trispectrum numerically\nand algorithmically very challenging. Here we address this challenge by\nintroducing the i-trispectrum, an integrated trispectrum that only depends on\nfour $k$-modes moduli.

With a fixed clustering of the interference graph, graph cluster\nrandomization (GCR) designs have been shown to greatly reduce variance compared\nto node-level random assignment, but even so the variance is still often\nprohibitively large. In this work we propose a randomized version of the GCR\ndesign, descriptively named randomized graph cluster randomization (RGCR),\nwhich uses a random clustering rather than a single fixed clustering. By\nconsidering an ensemble of many different cluster assignments, this design\navoids a key problem with GCR where a given node is sometimes \"lucky\" or\n\"unlucky\" in a given clustering.

The basic\nassumption is that coalescent events occur at a rate inversely proportional to\nthe effective population size $N_{e}(t)$, a time-varying measure of genetic\ndiversity. When the sampling process (collection of samples over time) depends\non $N_{e}(t)$, the coalescent and the sampling processes can be jointly modeled\nto improve estimation of $N_{e}(t)$. Failing to do so can lead to bias due to\nmodel misspecification. However, the way that the sampling process depends on\nthe effective population size may vary over time.

Methods: In this study, a two-step decision support system named\nTPIS is proposed for differential diagnosis of TB from pneumonia based on\nstacked ensemble classifiers. The first step of our proposed model aims at\nearly diagnosis based on low-cost features including demographic\ncharacteristics and patient symptoms (including 18 features).

In particular, we consider two practical IRS\ndeployment strategies that lead to different effective channels between the\nusers and AP, namely, the distributed deployment where the $M$ elements form\ntwo IRSs, each deployed in the vicinity of one user, versus the centralized\ndeployment where all the $M$ elements are deployed in the vicinity of the AP.\nFirst, we consider the uplink multiple-access channel (MAC) and derive the\ncapacity/achievable rate regions for both deployment strategies under different\nmultiple access schemes. It is shown that the centralized deployment generally\noutperforms the distributed deployment under symmetric channel setups in terms\nof achievable user rates. Next, we extend the results to the downlink broadcast\nchannel (BC) by leveraging the celebrated uplink-downlink (or MAC-BC) duality\nframework, and show that the superior rate performance of centralized over\ndistributed deployment also holds. Numerical results are presented that\nvalidate our analysis, and reveal new and useful insights for optimal IRS\ndeployment in wireless networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Sep 2020 17:59:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Jul 2021 14:23:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-12"}

Using PHANGS-MUSE optical\nintegral field spectroscopy, we measure the gas phase oxygen abundances\n(metallicities) across 7,138 HII regions in a sample of eight nearby disc\ngalaxies. In Paper I (Kreckel et al. 2019) we measure and report linear radial\ngradients in the metallicities of each galaxy, and qualitatively searched for\nazimuthal abundance variations. Here, we examine the two-dimensional variation\nin abundances once the radial gradient is subtracted, Delta(O/H), in order to\nquantify the homogeneity of the metal distribution and to measure the mixing\nscale over which HII region metallicities are correlated. We observe low\n(0.03--0.05 dex) scatter in Delta(O/H) globally in all galaxies, with\nsignificantly lower (0.02--0.03 dex) scatter on small (<600 pc) spatial scales.\nThis is consistent with the measurement uncertainties, and implies the\ntwo-dimensional metallicity distribution is highly correlated on scales of <600\npc. We compute the two point correlation function for metals in the disc in\norder to quantify the scale lengths associated with the observed homogeneity.\nThis mixing scale is observed to correlate better with the local gas velocity\ndispersion (of both cold and ionized gas) than with the star formation rate.\nSelecting only HII regions with enhanced abundances relative to a linear radial\ngradient, we do not observe increased homogeneity on small scales. This\nsuggests that the observed homogeneity is driven by the mixing introducing\nmaterial from large scales rather than by pollution from recent and on-going\nstar formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Sep 2020 18:03:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-14"}

Here, we present very\nlate-time photometry of the transient obtained with the Keck I telescope at\n$\\approx280$ days from peak light. Using the photometry to perform accurate\nflux calibration of a contemporaneous nebular phase spectrum, we measure an [O\nI] luminosity of $(0.19-1.08)\\times10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and [Ca II] luminosity\nof $(2.7-15.6)\\times10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$ over the range of the uncertain\nextinction along the line of sight.

Identifying trends between planetary and stellar\nproperties, including stellar age, can help distinguish between these competing\ntheories and offer insights as to how planets form and evolve. However, it can\nbe challenging to determine whether observed trends between planetary\nproperties and stellar age are driven by the age of the system -- pointing to\nevolution over time being an important factor -- or other parameters to which\nthe age may be related, such as stellar mass or stellar temperature. The\nsituation is complicated further by the possibilities of selection biases,\nsmall number statistics, uncertainties in stellar age, and orbital evolution\ntimescales that are typically much shorter than the range of observed ages.\nHere we develop a Bayesian statistical framework to assess the robustness of\nsuch observed correlations and to determine whether they are indeed due to\nevolutionary processes, are more likely to reflect different formation\nscenarios, or are merely coincidental.

However, it\ntends to be excessively liberal when the samples are asymmetric. This is likely\nbecause the test statistic is assumed to have a standard normal distribution\nfor sample sizes > 12. This work proposes an on-the-fly method to obtain the\ndistribution of the test statistic from which the critical/p-value may be\ncomputed directly. The method of likelihood maximization is used to estimate\nthe parameters of the parent distributions of the samples being compared. Using\nthese estimated populations, the null distribution of the test statistic is\nobtained by the Monte-Carlo method. Simulations are performed to compare the\nproposed method with that of standard normal approximation of the test\nstatistic. For small sample sizes (<= 20), the Monte-Carlo method outperforms\nthe normal approximation method. This is especially true for low values of\nsignificance levels (< 5%). Additionally, when the smaller sample has the\nlarger standard deviation, the Monte-Carlo method outperforms the normal\napproximation method even for large sample sizes (= 40/60). The two methods do\nnot differ in power. Finally, a Monte-Carlo sample size of 10^4 is found to be\nsufficient to obtain the aforementioned relative improvements in performance.\nThus, the results of this study pave the way for development of a toolbox to\nperform the robust rank-order test in a distribution-free manner.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Sep 2020 18:59:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-08"}

According to this model,\nsomitogenesis is based upon the interaction between a genetic oscillator, known\nas segmentation clock, and a differentiation wavefront, which provides the\npositional information indicating where each pair of somites is formed. Shortly\nafter the clock and wavefront paradigm was introduced, Meinhardt presented a\nconceptually different mathematical model for morphogenesis in general, and\nsomitogenesis in particular. Recently, Cotterell et al. rediscovered an\nequivalent model by systematically enumerating and studying small networks\nperforming segmentation. Cotterell et al. called it a progressive oscillatory\nreaction-diffusion (PORD) model. In the Meinhardt- PORD model, somitogenesis is\ndriven by short-range interactions and the posterior movement of the front is a\nlocal, emergent phenomenon, which is not controlled by global positional\ninformation. With this model, it is possible to explain some experimental\nobservations that are incompatible with the clock and wavefront model. However\nthe Meinhardt-PORD model has some important disadvantages of its own. Namely,\nit is quite sensitive to fluctuations and depends on very specific initial\nconditions (which are not biologically realistic). In this work, we propose an\nequivalent Meinhardt-PORD model, and then amend it to couple it with a\nwavefront consisting of a receding morphogen gradient. By doing so, we get a\nhybrid model between the Meinhardt-PORD and the clock-and-wavefront ones, which\novercomes most of the deficiencies of the two originating models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Sep 2020 19:03:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2021 22:17:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 1 Apr 2021 18:55:21 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 11 May 2021 16:59:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-30"}

In this paper, we\npropose an efficient scheme for quantum circuit equivalence\nchecking---specialized for verifying results of the IBM Qiskit quantum circuit\ncompilation flow. To this end, we combine characteristics unique to quantum\ncomputing, e.g., its inherent reversibility, and certain knowledge about the\ncompilation flow into a dedicated equivalence checking strategy. Experimental\nevaluations confirm that the proposed scheme allows to verify even large\ncircuit instances with tens of thousands of operations within seconds or even\nless, whereas state-of-the-art techniques frequently time-out or require\nsubstantially more runtime. A corresponding open source implementation of the\nproposed method is publicly available at https://github.com/iic-jku/qcec.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Sep 2020 19:58:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-11"}

Exploiting data sparsity is a common approach to further\naccelerate GEMM for CNN inference, and in particular, structural sparsity has\nthe advantages of predictable load balancing and very low index overhead. In\nthis paper, we address a key architectural challenge with structural sparsity:\nhow to provide support for a range of sparsity levels while maintaining high\nutilization of the hardware. We describe a time unrolled formulation of\nvariable density-bound block (VDBB) sparsity that allows for a configurable\nnumber of non-zero elements per block, at constant utilization. We then\ndescribe a systolic array microarchitecture that implements this scheme, with\ntwo data reuse optimizations. Firstly, we increase reuse in both operands and\npartial products by increasing the number of MACs per PE. Secondly, we\nintroduce a novel approach of moving the IM2COL transform into the hardware,\nwhich allows us to achieve a 3x data bandwidth expansion just before the\noperands are consumed by the datapath, reducing the SRAM power consumption. The\noptimizations for weight sparsity, activation sparsity and data reuse are all\ninterrelated and therefore the optimal combination is not obvious. Therefore,\nwe perform an design space evaluation to find the pareto-optimal design\ncharacteristics. The resulting design achieves 16.8 TOPS/W in 16nm with modest\n50% model sparsity and scales with model sparsity up to 55.7TOPS/W at 87.5%.

The molecular mechanism of such\nenhancement is, however, still a mystery. While earlier studies had attributed\nit to collision-induced transient perturbations, recent experiments point to\nthe pivotal role of nanoscale proximity of the INP and the free interface. By\nsimulating heterogeneous nucleation of ice within INP-supported nanofilms of\ntwo model water-like tetrahedral liquids, we demonstrate that such nanoscale\nproximity is sufficient for inducing rate increases commensurate with those\nobserved in contact freezing experiments, but only if the free interface has a\ntendency to enhance homogeneous nucleation. Water is suspected of possessing\nthis latter property, known as surface freezing propensity. Our findings\ntherefore establish a connection between surface freezing propensity and\nkinetic enhancement during contact nucleation. We also observe that faster\nnucleation proceeds through a mechanism markedly distinct from classical\nheterogeneous nucleation, involving the formation of hourglass-shaped\ncrystalline nuclei that conceive at either interface, and that have a lower\nfree energy of formation due to the nanoscale proximity of the interfaces and\nthe modulation of the free interfacial structure by the INP.

The length of a curve is its\nnumber of wall crossings, and the area of the surface is the number of\ncrossings of the walls themselves. We show how to approximate a Riemannian (or\nself-reverse Finsler) metric by a wallsystem.\n  This work is motivated by Gromov's filling area conjecture (FAC) that the\nhemisphere minimizes area among orientable Riemannian surfaces that fill a\ncircle isometrically. We introduce a discrete FAC: every square-celled surface\nthat fills isometrically a $2n$-cycle graph has at least $n(n-1)/2$ squares. We\nprove that our discrete FAC is equivalent to the FAC for surfaces with\nself-reverse metric.\n  If the surface is a disk, the discrete FAC follows from Steinitz's algorithm\nfor transforming curves into pseudolines. This gives a new proof of the FAC for\ndisks with self-reverse metric. We also imitate Ivanov's proof of the same\nfact, using discrete differential forms. And we prove that the FAC holds for\nM\\\"obius bands with self-reverse metric. For this we use a combinatorial curve\nshortening flow developed by de Graaf--Schrijver and Hass--Scott. With the same\nmethod we prove the systolic inequality for Klein bottles with self-reverse\nmetric, conjectured by Sabourau--Yassine.\n  Self-reverse metrics can be discretized using walls because every normed\nplane satisfies Crofton's formula: the length of every segment equals the\nsymplectic measure of the set of lines that it crosses. Directed 2-dimensional\nmetrics have no Crofton formula, but can be discretized as well. Their\ndiscretization is a triangulation where the length of each edge is 1 in one way\nand 0 in the other, and the area of the surface is the number of triangles.\nThis structure is a simplicial set, dual to a plabic graph. The role of the\nwalls is played by Postnikov's strands.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Sep 2020 22:36:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-08"}

We consider a\nnetwork of agents, each of which has a state in $\\mathbb{R}^d$. Some agents in\nthe network are adversarial and can change their states arbitrarily. The normal\n(non-adversarial) agents interact locally and update their states to achieve\nconsensus at some point in the convex hull $\\calC$ of their initial states.\nThis objective is achievable if the number of adversaries in the neighborhood\nof normal agents is less than a specific value, which is a function of the\nlocal connectivity and the state dimension $d$. However, to be resilient\nagainst adversaries, especially in the case of large $d$, the desired local\nconnectivity is large. We discuss that resilience against adversarial agents\ncan be improved if normal agents are allowed to converge in a bounded region\n$\\calB\\supseteq\\calC$, which means normal agents converge at some point close\nto but not necessarily inside $\\calC$ in the worst case. The accuracy of\nresilient consensus can be measured by the Hausdorff distance between $\\calB$\nand $\\calC$.

This variation appears in organisms ranging from microbes to metazoans.\nStochastic gene expression has important consequences for cellular function.\nThe random fluctuations in protein levels produce variability in cellular\nbehavior. It is beneficial in some contexts and harmful to others. These\nsituations include stress response, metabolism, development, cell cycle,\ncircadian rhythms, and aging. Different model studies e.g., constitutive,\ntwo-state, etc., reveal that the fluctuations in mRNA and protein levels arise\nfrom different steps of gene expression among which the steps in transcription\nhave the maximum effect. The pulsatile mRNA production through RNAP-II based\nreinitiation of transcription is an important part of gene transcription.\nThough, the effect of that process on mRNA and protein levels is very little\nknown. The addition of any biochemical step in the constitutive or two-state\nprocess generally decreases the mean and increases the Fano factor. In this\nstudy, we have shown that the RNAP-II based reinitiation process in gene\ntranscription can have different effects on both mean and Fano factor at mRNA\nlevels in different model systems.

In\nparticular, for natural water turbulence several models for the spatial power\nspectra have been developed based on the classic, Kolmogorov postulates.\nHowever, as currently widely accepted, non-Kolmogorov turbulent regime is also\ncommon in the stratified flow fields, as suggested by recent developments in\natmospheric optics. Until now all the models developed for the non-Kolmogorov\noptical turbulence were pertinent to atmospheric research and, hence, involved\nonly one advected scalar, e.g., temperature. We generalize the oceanic spatial\npower spectrum, based on two advected scalars, temperature and salinity\nconcentration, to the non-Kolmogorov turbulence regime, with the help of the\nso-called \"Upper-Bound Limitation\" and by adopting the concept of spectral\ncorrelation of two advected scalars. The proposed power spectrum can handle\ngeneral non-Kolmogorov, anisotropic turbulence but reduces to Kolmogorov,\nisotropic case if the power law exponents of temperature and salinity are set\nto 11/3 and anisotropy coefficient is set to unity. To show the application of\nthe new spectrum, we derive the expression for the second-order mutual\ncoherence function of a spherical wave and examine its coherence radius (in\nboth scalar and vector forms) to characterize the turbulent disturbance. Our\nnumerical calculations show that the statistics of the spherical wave vary\nsubstantially with temperature and salinity non-Kolmogorov power law exponents\nand temperature-salinity spectral correlation coefficient.

A realistic simulation of anticyclonic eddies on the Texas-Louisiana\nshelf reveals that such critical layers can form where the eddies impinge onto\nthe sloping bottom. Velocity shear bands in the simulation indicate that\nwind-forced NIWs are radiated downward from the surface in the eddies, bend\nupward near the bottom, and enter critical layers over the continental shelf,\nresulting in inertially-modulated enhanced mixing. Idealized simulations\ndesigned to capture this flow reproduce the wave propagation and enhanced\nmixing. The link between the enhanced mixing and wave trapping in the slantwise\ncritical layer is made using ray-tracing and an analysis of the waves'\nenergetics in the idealized simulations. An ensemble of simulations is\nperformed spanning the relevant parameter space that demonstrates that the\nstrength of the mixing is correlated with the degree to which NIWs are trapped\nin the critical layers.

Various approaches have been proposed to\nfacilitate the analysis of passing tactics. However, the dynamic changes of a\nteam's employed tactics over a match have not been comprehensively\ninvestigated. To address the problem, we closely collaborate with domain\nexperts and characterize requirements to analyze the dynamic changes of a\nteam's passing tactics.

However, it often degrades the model performance\non normal images and the defense does not generalize well to novel attacks.\nGiven the success of deep generative models such as GANs and VAEs in\ncharacterizing the underlying manifold of images, we investigate whether or not\nthe aforementioned problems can be remedied by exploiting the underlying\nmanifold information. To this end, we construct an \"On-Manifold ImageNet\"\n(OM-ImageNet) dataset by projecting the ImageNet samples onto the manifold\nlearned by StyleGSN. For this dataset, the underlying manifold information is\nexact. Using OM-ImageNet, we first show that adversarial training in the latent\nspace of images improves both standard accuracy and robustness to on-manifold\nattacks. However, since no out-of-manifold perturbations are realized, the\ndefense can be broken by Lp adversarial attacks. We further propose Dual\nManifold Adversarial Training (DMAT) where adversarial perturbations in both\nlatent and image spaces are used in robustifying the model. Our DMAT improves\nperformance on normal images, and achieves comparable robustness to the\nstandard adversarial training against Lp attacks. In addition, we observe that\nmodels defended by DMAT achieve improved robustness against novel attacks which\nmanipulate images by global color shifts or various types of image filtering.\nInterestingly, similar improvements are also achieved when the defended models\nare tested on out-of-manifold natural images.

In particular, since the tensor\nrank controls the complexity of the CPD model, its inaccurate learning would\ncause overfitting to noise or underfitting to the signal sources, and even\ndestroy the interpretability of model parameters. However, the optimal\ndetermination of a tensor rank is known to be a non-deterministic\npolynomial-time hard (NP-hard) task. Rather than exhaustively searching for the\nbest tensor rank via trial-and-error experiments, Bayesian inference under the\nGaussian-gamma prior was introduced in the context of probabilistic CPD\nmodeling, and it was shown to be an effective strategy for automatic tensor\nrank determination. This triggered flourishing research on other structured\ntensor CPDs with automatic tensor rank learning. On the other side of the coin,\nthese research works also reveal that the Gaussian-gamma model does not perform\nwell for high-rank tensors and/or low signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs).

However, the method does not always converge to\na flat minimum of the loss surface that can demonstrate high generalization\ncapability. Weight noise injection has been extensively studied for finding\nflat minima using the SGD method. We devise a new weight-noise injection-based\nSGD method that adds symmetrical noises to the DNN weights. The training with\nsymmetrical noise evaluates the loss surface at two adjacent points, by which\nconvergence to sharp minima can be avoided. Fixed-magnitude symmetric noises\nare added to minimize training instability. The proposed method is compared\nwith the conventional SGD method and previous weight-noise injection algorithms\nusing convolutional neural networks for image classification. Particularly,\nperformance improvements in large batch training are demonstrated. This method\nshows superior performance compared with conventional SGD and weight-noise\ninjection methods regardless of the batch-size and learning rate scheduling\nalgorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Sep 2020 07:02:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-08"}

Moreover, we give a polynomial time adaptive algorithm that shows\nthat our bound is tight up to a small additive term.\n  For non-adaptive algorithms, an upper bound of $O((D/\\Delta^2)$ $(\\log\n(n/D)+\\log \\Delta) )$ is achieved by means of non-constructive proof. This\nimproves the lower bound $O((\\log D)/(\\log\\Delta))D\\log n)$ from \\cite{ALA17}\nand matches the lower bound up to a small additive term.\n  In addition, we study polynomial time constructive algorithms. We use\nexisting polynomial time constructible \\emph{expander regular bipartite\ngraphs}, \\emph{extractors} and \\emph{condensers} to construct two polynomial\ntime algorithms. The first algorithm makes $O((D^{1+o(1)}/\\Delta^2)\\cdot \\log\nn)$ tests, and the second makes $(D/\\Delta^2)\\cdot quazipoly$ $(\\log n)$ tests.\nThis is the first explicit construction with an almost optimal test complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Sep 2020 11:57:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-08"}

Since the array length is of the same order as the\ndistance to the users, the long-term fading coefficients of a given user vary\nwith the different antennas at the base station (BS). Thus, the signal\ntransmitted by some antennas might reach the user with much more power than\nthat transmitted by some others. From a green perspective, it is not effective\nto simultaneously activate hundreds or even thousands of antennas, since the\npower-hungry radio frequency (RF) chains of the active antennas increase\nsignificantly the total energy consumption. Besides, a larger number of\nselected antennas increases the power required by linear processing, such as\nprecoding matrix computation, and short-term channel estimation. In this paper,\nwe propose four antenna selection (AS) approaches to be deployed in XL-MIMO\nsystems aiming at maximizing the total energy efficiency (EE).

The present paper seeks to quantify the rate of\ndeformation of the flame surface and burning velocity caused by the interaction\nand to clarify the underlying mechanisms. The interaction of a single shock\nwave with a cellular flame in a Hele-Shaw shock tube configuration was studied\nexperimentally, numerically, and theoretically. A mixture of stoichiometric\nhydrogen-air at sub-atmospheric pressure was chosen such that large cells can\nbe isolated and their deformation studied with precision subsequent to the\ninteraction. Following passage of the incident shock and vorticity deposition\nalong the flame surface, the flame cusps are flattened and reversed backwards\ninto the burnt gas. The reversed flame then goes through four stages. At times\nsignificantly less than the characteristic flame burning time, the flame front\ndeforms as an inert interface due to the Ricthmyer-Meshkov instability with\nnon-linear effects becoming noticeable. At times comparable to the laminar\nflame time, dilatation due to chemical energy release amplifies the growth rate\nof Ricthmyer-Meshkov instability. This stage is abruptly terminated by the\ntransverse burnout of the resulting flame funnels, followed by a longer front\nre-adjustment to a new cellular flame evolving on the cellular time scale of\nthe flame.

In this paper, we consider a wireless network where multiple\nbase stations (BSs) serve their respective users with the aid of distributed\nIRSs in the downlink communication. Specifically, each IRS assists in the\ntransmission from its associated BS to user via passive beamforming, while in\nthe meantime, it also randomly scatters the signals from other co-channel BSs,\nthus resulting in additional signal as well as interference paths in the\nnetwork. As such, a new IRS-user/BS association problem arises pertaining to\noptimally balance the passive beamforming gains from all IRSs among different\nBS-user communication links.

This paper contributes to this area of\nstudy by proposing a diagrammatic methodology to decompose a sequential\nprogram.

We then\nassessed the differences between groups with and without deteriorating mental\nhealth profiles in terms of these features. Significant features included\nlate-night online activities, continuous usages, and time away from the\ninternet, porn consumptions, and keywords associated with negative emotions,\nsocial activities, and personal affairs. Though further studies are required,\nour results demonstrated the feasibility of utilizing pervasive online data to\nestablish non-invasive surveillance systems for mental health conditions that\nbypasses many disadvantages of existing screening methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Sep 2020 00:54:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-22"}

Based on this framework\ntwo platforms were built to capture insights from fast-paced and slow-paced\nsocial data. For fast-paced, a self-structuring and incremental learning\ntechnique was developed to automatically capture salient topics and\ncorresponding dynamics over time. An event detection technique was developed to\nautomatically monitor those identified topic pathways for significant\nfluctuations in social behaviours using multiple indicators such as volume and\nsentiment. This platform is demonstrated using two large datasets with over 1\nmillion tweets. The separated topic pathways were representative of the key\ntopics of each entity and coherent against topic coherence measures. Identified\nevents were validated against contemporary events reported in news. Secondly\nfor the slow-paced social data, a suite of new machine learning and natural\nlanguage processing techniques were developed to automatically capture\nself-disclosed information of the individuals such as demographics, emotions\nand timeline of personal events. This platform was trialled on a large text\ncorpus of over 4 million posts collected from online support groups. This was\nfurther extended to transform prostate cancer related online support group\ndiscussions into a multidimensional representation and investigated the\nself-disclosed quality of life of patients (and partners) against time,\ndemographics and clinical factors. The capabilities of this extended platform\nhave been demonstrated using a text corpus collected from 10 prostate cancer\nonline support groups comprising of 609,960 prostate cancer discussions and\n22,233 patients.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Sep 2020 14:53:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-22"}

The basic inspiration of LPB\noriginates from the process of accepting graduated learners from high school in\ndifferent departments at university. In addition, the changes those learners\nshould do in their studying behaviors to improve their study level at\nuniversity. The most important stages of optimization; exploitation and\nexploration are outlined by designing the process of accepting graduated\nlearners from high school to university and the procedure of improving the\nlearner's studying behavior at university to improve the level of their study.\nTo show the accuracy of the proposed algorithm, it is evaluated against a\nnumber of test functions, such as traditional benchmark functions, CEC-C06 2019\ntest functions, and a real-world case study problem. The results of the\nproposed algorithm are then compared to the DA, GA, and PSO. The proposed\nalgorithm produced superior results in most of the cases and comparative in\nsome others. It is proved that the algorithm has a great ability to deal with\nthe large optimization problems comparing to the DA, GA, and PSO. The overall\nresults proved the ability of LPB in improving the initial population and\nconverging towards the global optima. Moreover, the results of the proposed\nwork are proved statistically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Sep 2020 04:17:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-24"}
