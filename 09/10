Despite its recent empirical success in operations\nresearch and machine learning, existing performance guarantees for generic loss\nfunctions are either overly conservative due to the curse of dimensionality, or\nplausible only in large sample asymptotics. In this paper, we develop a\nnon-asymptotic framework for analyzing the out-of-sample performance for\nWasserstein robust learning and the generalization bound for its related\nLipschitz and gradient regularization problems. To the best of our knowledge,\nthis gives the first finite-sample guarantee for generic Wasserstein DRO\nproblems without suffering from the curse of dimensionality. Our results\nhighlight that Wasserstein DRO, with a properly chosen radius, balances between\nthe empirical mean of the loss and the variation of the loss, measured by the\nLipschitz norm or the gradient norm of the loss. Our analysis is based on two\nnovel methodological developments that are of independent interest: 1) a new\nconcentration inequality controlling the decay rate of large deviation\nprobabilities by the variation of the loss and, 2) a localized Rademacher\ncomplexity theory based on the variation of the loss.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Sep 2020 16:02:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2020 11:01:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 30 Apr 2022 22:44:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-03"}

Lately, these support systems have been found to be\ndiscriminatory in the context of many practical deployments. In an attempt to\nevaluate and mitigate these biases, algorithmic fairness literature has been\nnurtured using notions of comparative justice, which relies primarily on\ncomparing two/more individuals or groups within the society that is supported\nby such systems. However, such a fairness notion is not very useful in the\nidentification of fair auditors who are hired to evaluate latent biases within\ndecision-support systems. As a solution, we introduce a paradigm shift in\nalgorithmic fairness via proposing a new fairness notion based on the principle\nof non-comparative justice. Assuming that the auditor makes fairness\nevaluations based on some (potentially unknown) desired properties of the\ndecision-support system, the proposed fairness notion compares the system's\noutcome with that of the auditor's desired outcome. We show that the proposed\nfairness notion also provides guarantees in terms of comparative fairness\nnotions by proving that any system can be deemed fair from the perspective of\ncomparative fairness (e.g. individual fairness and statistical parity) if it is\nnon-comparatively fair with respect to an auditor who has been deemed fair with\nrespect to the same fairness notions. We also show that the converse holds true\nin the context of individual fairness. A brief discussion is also presented\nregarding how our fairness notion can be used to identify fair and reliable\nauditors, and how we can use them to quantify biases in decision-support\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Sep 2020 16:04:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-10"}

A drawback of\nrepresenting tracts as volumetric labels, rather than sets of streamlines, is\nthat it precludes point-wise analyses of microstructural or geometric features\nalong a tract. Traditional tractography pipelines, which do allow such\nanalyses, can benefit from detailed whole-brain segmentations to guide tract\nreconstruction. Here, we introduce fast, deep learning-based segmentation of\n170 anatomical regions directly on diffusion-weighted MR images, removing the\ndependency of conventional segmentation methods on T 1-weighted images and slow\npre-processing pipelines. Working natively in diffusion space avoids non-linear\ndistortions and registration errors across modalities, as well as interpolation\nartifacts.

We investigate various combinations of\ndiffusion-derived inputs and show generalization across different numbers of\ngradient directions. Finally, integrating our approach to provide anatomical\npriors for tractography pipelines, such as TRACULA, removes hours of\npre-processing time and permits processing even in the absence of high-quality\nT 1-weighted scans, without degrading the quality of the resulting tract\nestimates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Sep 2020 16:20:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-10"}

The slope of the\nrising light curve depends sensitively on the angle of the observer with\nrespect to the jet axis, which is likely to be perpendicular to the merger\nplane of the neutron star binary. Therefore, the afterglow emission can be used\nto constrain the inclination of the merging system.

It has been a well established fact in control theory that\nstability properties can be characterized by Lyapunov functions. Reachability\nproperties can also be naturally captured by Lyapunov functions for finite-time\nstability. Motivated by safety-critical control applications, such as in\nautonomous systems and robotics, there has been a recent surge of interests in\ncharacterizing safety properties using barrier functions. Lyapunov and barrier\nfunctions conditions, however, are sometimes viewed as competing objectives. In\nthis paper, we provide a unified theoretical treatment of Lyapunov and barrier\nfunctions in terms of converse theorems for stability properties with safety\nguarantees and reach-avoid-stay type specifications. We show that if a system\n(modeled as a dynamical system with measurable perturbations) possesses a\nstability with safety property, then there exists a smooth Lyapunov function to\ncertify such a property. This Lyapunov function is shown to be defined on the\nentire set of initial conditions from which solutions satisfy this property. A\nsimilar but slightly weaker statement is made for reach-avoid-stay\nspecifications. We show by a simple example that the latter statement cannot be\nstrengthened without additional assumptions. We further extend the results for\nsystems with control inputs and prove existence of converse Lyapunov-barrier\nfunctions for reach-and-avoid specifications. While the converse\nLyapunov-barrier theorems are not constructive, as with classical converse\nLyapunov theorems, we believe that the unified necessary and sufficient\nconditions with a single Lyapunov-barrier function are of theoretical interest\nand can hopefully shed some light on computational approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Sep 2020 17:27:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 31 Dec 2021 03:44:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-03"}

However, most of the\nexisting SSL algorithms in literature tend to regularize the model training by\nperturbing networks and/or data. Observing that multi/dual-task learning\nattends to various levels of information which have inherent prediction\nperturbation, we ask the question in this work: can we explicitly build\ntask-level regularization rather than implicitly constructing networks- and/or\ndata-level perturbation-and-transformation for SSL? To answer this question, we\npropose a novel dual-task-consistency semi-supervised framework for the first\ntime. Concretely, we use a dual-task deep network that jointly predicts a\npixel-wise segmentation map and a geometry-aware level set representation of\nthe target. The level set representation is converted to an approximated\nsegmentation map through a differentiable task transform layer. Simultaneously,\nwe introduce a dual-task consistency regularization between the level\nset-derived segmentation maps and directly predicted segmentation maps for both\nlabeled and unlabeled data. Extensive experiments on two public datasets show\nthat our method can largely improve the performance by incorporating the\nunlabeled data.

Their needs often involve\nunderstanding the semantics of such documents. That depends in part on the role\nof the deponent, e.g., plaintiff, defendant, law enforcement personnel, expert,\netc. In the case of tort litigation associated with property and casualty\ninsurance claims, such as relating to an injury, it is important to know not\nonly about liability, but also about events, accidents, physical conditions,\nand treatments.\n  We hypothesize that a legal deposition consists of various aspects that are\ndiscussed as part of the deponent testimony. Accordingly, we developed an\nontology of aspects in a legal deposition for accident and injury cases. Using\nthat, we have developed a classifier that can identify portions of text for\neach of the aspects of interest. Doing so was complicated by the peculiarities\nof this genre, e.g., that deposition transcripts generally consist of data in\nthe form of question-answer (QA) pairs. Accordingly, our automated system\nstarts with pre-processing, and then transforms the QA pairs into a canonical\nform made up of declarative sentences. Classifying the declarative sentences\nthat are generated, according to the aspect, can then help with downstream\ntasks such as summarization, segmentation, question-answering, and information\nretrieval.\n  Our methods have achieved a classification F1 score of 0.83. Having the\naspects classified with a good accuracy will help in choosing QA pairs that can\nbe used as candidate summary sentences, and to generate an informative summary\nfor legal professionals or insurance claim agents. Our methodology could be\nextended to legal depositions of other kinds, and to aid services like\nsearching.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Sep 2020 18:00:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-11"}

The precise\ndetermination of these bounds, however, can become increasingly difficult as\nmore and more SM modes and operators are taken into account. We study two\napproaches that aim at obtaining the full set of bounds for a given set of SM\nfields: 1) the traditional elastic positivity approach, which exploits the\nelastic scattering amplitudes of states with arbitrarily superposed helicities\nas well as other quantum numbers, and 2) the newly proposed extremal positivity\napproach, which constructs the allowed coefficient space directly by using the\nextremal representation of convex cones. Considering the electroweak\ngauge-bosons as an example, we demonstrate how the best analytical and\nnumerical positivity bounds can be obtained in several ways. We further compare\nthe constraining power and the efficiency of various approaches, as well as\ntheir applicability to more complex problems. While the new extremal approach\nis more constraining by construction, we also find that it is analytically\neasier to use, numerically much faster than the elastic approach, and much more\napplicable when more SM particle states and operators are taken into account.\nAs a byproduct, we provide the best positivity bounds on the transversal\nquartic-gauge-boson couplings, required by the axiomatic principles of QFT, and\nshow that they exclude $\\approx 99.3\\%$ of the parameter space currently being\nsearched at the LHC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Sep 2020 18:02:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 20 Sep 2020 14:19:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}

We make three key contributions: a theory-driven\ncomputational representation of narratives, a novel extraction algorithm to\nobtain these representations from data, and an evaluation of our approach. In\nparticular, given the effectiveness of visual metaphors, we employ a route map\nmetaphor to design a narrative map representation. The narrative map\nrepresentation illustrates the events and stories in the narrative as a series\nof landmarks and routes on the map. Each element of our representation is\nbacked by a corresponding element from formal narrative theory, thus providing\na solid theoretical background to our method. Our approach extracts the\nunderlying graph structure of the narrative map using a novel optimization\ntechnique focused on maximizing coherence while respecting structural and\ncoverage constraints. We showcase the effectiveness of our approach by\nperforming a user evaluation to assess the quality of the representation,\nmetaphor, and visualization.

Artificial\nlife provides us with powerful tools for understanding the dynamic behavior of\nbiological systems and capturing this behavior in manmade substrates. With this\napproach, we can move towards a new computing paradigm concerned with\nharnessing emergent computation in physical substrates not governed by the\nconstraints of Moore's law and ultimately realize massively parallel and\ndistributed computing technology.

From the perspective of lenders, they want to maximize the\nprofit while minimizing the risk. Therefore, many studies have used machine\nlearning algorithms to help the lenders identify the \"best\" loans for making\ninvestments. The studies have mainly focused on two categories to guide the\nlenders' investments: one aims at minimizing the risk of investment (i.e., the\ncredit scoring perspective) while the other aims at maximizing the profit\n(i.e., the profit scoring perspective). However, they have all focused on one\ncategory only and there is seldom research trying to integrate the two\ncategories together. Motivated by this, we propose a two-stage framework that\nincorporates the credit information into a profit scoring modeling.

Identifying optimal inspection and maintenance policies\ndemands the solution of a complex sequential decision-making problem under\nuncertainty, with the main objective of efficiently controlling the risk\nassociated with structural failures. Addressing this complexity, risk-based\ninspection planning methodologies, supported often by dynamic Bayesian\nnetworks, evaluate a set of pre-defined heuristic decision rules to reasonably\nsimplify the decision problem.

One way\nto predict the behavior of the flow while taking the effects of fault into\naccount is to use the mixed finite element method. However, the mixed method\ncould be time consuming due to large number of degree of freedom since both\npressure and velocity are considered in the system. A new modeling method is\npresented in this paper. First, we introduce approximations of pressure based\non the relation of pressure and velocity. We furthure decouple the approximated\npressure from velocity so that it can be solved independently by continuous\nGalerkin finite element method. The new problem involves less degree of freedom\nthan the mixed method for a given mesh . Moreover, local problem associated\nwith a small subdomain around the fault is additionally solved to increase the\naccuracy of approximations around fault. Numerical experiments are conducted to\nexamine the accuracy and efficiency of the new method. Results of\nthree-dimensional tests show that our new method is up to 30$\\times$ faster\nthan the the mixed method at given $L^2$ pressure error.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Sep 2020 21:08:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-11"}

In contrast to existing data-driven\nmodels, which are trained for a specific garment or mesh topology, our fully\nconvolutional model can cope with a large family of garments, represented as\nparametric predefined 2D panels with arbitrary mesh topology, including long\ndresses, shirts, and tight tops. Under the hood, our novel geometric deep\nlearning approach learns to drape 3D garments by decoupling the three different\nsources of deformations that condition the fit of clothing: garment type,\ntarget body shape, and material. Specifically, we first learn a regressor that\npredicts the 3D drape of the input parametric garment when worn by a mean body\nshape. Then, after a mesh topology optimization step where we generate a\nsufficient level of detail for the input garment type, we further deform the\nmesh to reproduce deformations caused by the target body shape. Finally, we\npredict fine-scale details such as wrinkles that depend mostly on the garment\nmaterial. We qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate that our fully\nconvolutional approach outperforms existing methods in terms of generalization\ncapabilities and memory requirements, and therefore it opens the door to more\ngeneral learning-based models for virtual try-on applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Sep 2020 22:38:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-11"}

Current RFFs-based kernel learning methods usually work in a\ntwo-stage way. In the first-stage process, learning the optimal feature map is\noften formulated as a target alignment problem, which aims to align the learned\nkernel with the pre-defined target kernel (usually the ideal kernel). In the\nsecond-stage process, a linear learner is conducted with respect to the mapped\nrandom features. Nevertheless, the pre-defined kernel in target alignment is\nnot necessarily optimal for the generalization of the linear learner. Instead,\nin this paper, we consider a one-stage process that incorporates the kernel\nlearning and linear learner into a unifying framework. To be specific, a\ngenerative network via RFFs is devised to implicitly learn the kernel, followed\nby a linear classifier parameterized as a full-connected layer. Then the\ngenerative network and the classifier are jointly trained by solving the\nempirical risk minimization (ERM) problem to reach a one-stage solution.

The problem is structured as an optimal control system for tracking a\nreference value, corresponding to the maximum usage level of a critical\nresource, such as ICU beds. However, instead of using conventional optimal\ncontrol methods, RL is used to find optimal control policies. A framework was\ndeveloped to calculate optimal cyclic lockdown timings using an RL-based on-off\ncontroller. The RL-based controller is implemented as an RL agent that\ninteracts with an epidemic simulator, implemented as an extended SEIR epidemic\nmodel. The RL agent learns a policy function that produces an optimal sequence\nof open/lockdown decisions such that goals specified in the RL reward function\nare optimized. Two concurrent goals were used: the first one is a public health\ngoal that minimizes overshoots of ICU bed usage above an ICU bed threshold, and\nthe second one is a socio-economic goal that minimizes the time spent under\nlockdowns. It is assumed that cyclic lockdowns are considered as a temporary\nalternative to extended lockdowns when a region faces imminent danger of\noverpassing resource capacity limits and when imposing an extended lockdown\nwould cause severe social and economic consequences due to lack of necessary\neconomic resources to support its affected population during an extended\nlockdown.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2020 02:51:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-11"}

Methods: The system tracks individual protons through one (X, Y)\nscintillating fiber tracker plane upstream and downstream of the object and\ninto a 13 cm-thick scintillating block residual energy detector. The fibers in\nthe tracker planes are multiplexed into silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) to\nreduce the number of electronics channels. The light signal from the residual\nenergy detector is collected by 16 photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). Only four\nsignals from the PMTs are output from each event, which allows for fast signal\nreadout. A robust calibration method of the PMT signal to residual energy has\nbeen developed to obtain accurate proton images. The development of\npatient-specific scan patterns using multiple input energies allows for an\nimage to be produced with minimal excess dose delivered to the patient.\nResults: The calibration of signals in the energy detector produces accurate\nresidual range measurements limited by intrinsic range straggling.

Point set upsampling aims to increase its\ndensity and regularity such that a better surface recovery could be achieved.\nThe problem is severely ill-posed and challenging, considering that the\nupsampling target itself is only an approximation of the underlying surface.\nMotivated to improve the surface approximation via point set upsampling, we\nidentify the factors that are critical to the objective, by pairing the surface\napproximation error bounds of the input and output point sets.

In\ncontrast, with the help of mature public key infrastructure (PKI) and\npost-quantum cryptography (PQC) with quantum resistant security, each user only\nneeds to apply for a digital certificate from certificate authority (CA) to\nachieve efficient and secure authentication for QKD. We only need to assume the\nshort-term security of the PQC algorithm to achieve the long-term security of\nthe distributed keys. Here, we experimentally verified the feasibility,\nefficiency and stability of the PQC algorithm in QKD authentication, and\ndemonstrated the advantages when new users join the QKD network. Using PQC\nauthentication we only need to believe the CA is safe, rather than all trusted\nrelays. QKD combined with PQC authentication will greatly promote and extend\nthe application prospects of quantum safe communication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2020 04:12:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-07"}

Since then, violent war-like zones have\nappeared and disappeared throughout Mexico, causing unfathomable human, social\nand economic losses. One of the most emblematic of these zones is the city of\nMonterrey, a central scenario in the narco-war. To better understand the\nunderlying mechanisms by which violence has evolved and spread through the\ncity, here we propose a network-based approach. For this purpose, we define a\nhomicide network where nodes are geographical entities that are connected\nthrough spatial proximity and crime similarity. Data is taken from a crime\ndatabase spanning 86 months in the Monterrey metropolitan area, containing\nmanually curated geo-located and dated homicides, as well as from Open Street\nMap for urban environment. Under this approach, we first identify independent\ncrime sectors corresponding to different connected components. Each of these\nclusters of crime presents crime evolution similar to the one at state and\nnational levels. We then show how crime spread from neighborhood to adjacent\nneighborhoods when violence was mainly cartel-related and how it was chiefly\nstatic at a different time. Finally, we show a relation between homicidal crime\nand urban landscape by studying the distance of safe and violent neighborhoods\nto the closest highway and by studying the evolution of highway and crime\ndistance over the cartel-related years and the following period. With this\napproach, we are able to describe more accurately the evolution of homicidal\ncrime in a metropolitan area.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2020 05:16:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-11"}

Here, we introduce a large-scale Nonlinear Granger\nCausality (lsNGC) approach for inferring directional, nonlinear, multivariate\ncausal interactions between system components from short high-dimensional\ntime-series recordings. By modeling interactions with nonlinear state-space\ntransformations from limited observational data, lsNGC identifies casual\nrelations with no explicit a priori assumptions on functional interdependence\nbetween component time-series in a computationally efficient manner.\nAdditionally, our method provides a mathematical formulation revealing\nstatistical significance of inferred causal relations. We extensively study the\nability of lsNGC to recovering network structure from two-node to thirty-four\nnode chaotic time-series systems. Our results suggest that lsNGC captures\nmeaningful interactions from limited observational data, where it performs\nfavorably when compared to traditionally used methods. Finally, we demonstrate\nthe applicability of lsNGC to estimating causality in large, real-world systems\nby inferring directional nonlinear, multivariate causal relationships among a\nlarge number of relatively short time-series acquired from functional Magnetic\nResonance Imaging (fMRI) data of the human brain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2020 06:27:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-04"}

The sharp rise of\nusage in Internet of Things (IoT) devices has imposed new challenges in device\nidentification due to a wide variety of devices, protocols and control\ninterfaces. In a network, conventional IoT devices identify each other by\nutilizing IP or MAC addresses, which are prone to spoofing. Moreover, IoT\ndevices are low power devices with minimal embedded security solution. To\nmitigate the issue in IoT devices, fingerprint (DFP) for device identification\ncan be used. DFP identifies a device by using implicit identifiers, such as\nnetwork traffic (or packets), radio signal, which a device used for its\ncommunication over the network. These identifiers are closely related to the\ndevice hardware and software features. In this paper, we exploit TCP/IP packet\nheader features to create a device fingerprint utilizing device originated\nnetwork packets. We present a set of three metrics which separate some features\nfrom a packet which contribute actively for device identification. To evaluate\nour approach, we used publicly accessible two datasets.

The key idea of CQNC is that the\nbackaction noises arising from radiation pressure and driving can be offset by\ncoupling the optical mode to a near-resonant ancillary mode. In this work, a\ncontinuous weak-force sensing under CQNC is developed in a double-mode\noptomechanical system consisted of two optical modes with distinct frequencies\nand a mechanical mode. In particular, under the asymmetrical treatment by\ndriving the higher-frequency optical mode, probing the lower-frequency one, and\ncoupling the probe mode to the ancillary mode, our configuration can be used to\nresemble the conventional CQNC sensing. It is more important to find that the\ncurrent CQNC strategy simultaneously stabilizes the double-mode system with\nrespect to both the constrained driving power (the Routh-Hurwitz criterion) and\nthe effective positive mechanical damping (the stable optical-spring\ncondition). Moreover, through exploiting the coupling between the probe mode\nand the ancillary mode under this nontrivial extension of the CQNC strategy\n(from the single-mode version to the double-mode one), the rotating-wave term\nand the counter-rotating term are found to be responsible to the system\nstability and the noise cancellation, respectively.

A nearly wake-up free device was achieved\nafter reduction of carbon contamination and oxygen defects by increasing the\nozone dosage. The sample which was grown at 30 sec ozone pulse duration shows\nabout 98% of the woken-up Pr at the pristine state while those grown below 5\nsec ozone pulse time show a pinched hysteresis loop, undergone a large wake-up\neffect. This behavior is attributed to the increase in oxygen vacancy and\ncarbon concentration in the films deposited at insufficient O3 dosage which was\nconfirmed by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS).

The use of general-purpose multi-class classification\nmethods for fault diagnosis is complicated by imbalanced training data and\nunknown fault classes. Another complicating factor is that different fault\nclasses can result in similar residual outputs, especially for small faults,\nwhich causes classification ambiguities. In this work, a framework for\ndata-driven analysis and open-set classification is developed for fault\ndiagnosis applications using the Kullback-Leibler divergence. A data-driven\nfault classification algorithm is proposed which can handle imbalanced\ndatasets, class overlapping, and unknown faults. In addition, an algorithm is\nproposed to estimate the size of the fault when training data contains\ninformation from known fault realizations. An advantage of the proposed\nframework is that it can also be used for quantitative analysis of fault\ndiagnosis performance, for example, to analyze how easy it is to classify\nfaults of different magnitudes. To evaluate the usefulness of the proposed\nmethods, multiple datasets from different fault scenarios have been collected\nfrom an internal combustion engine test bench to illustrate the design process\nof a data-driven diagnosis system, including quantitative fault diagnosis\nanalysis and evaluation of the developed open set fault classification\nalgorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2020 09:53:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Aug 2022 20:36:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-15"}

Furthermore,\nwe want to put observational constraints on the mechanisms responsible in\nstarless cores for the desorption of methanol from the surface of dust grains\nwhere it is efficiently produced. Methods. We mapped methanol, CH3OH, and\ncyclopropenylidene, c-C3H2, with the IRAM 30m telescope in the 3 mm band\ntowards six starless cores embedded in different environments, and in different\nevolutionary stages. Furthermore, we searched for correlations among physical\nproperties of the cores and the methanol distribution. Results. From our maps\nwe can infer that the chemical segregation between CH3OH and c-C3H2 is driven\nby uneven illumination from the interstellar radiation field (ISRF). The side\nof the core that is more illuminated has more C atoms in the gas-phase and the\nformation of carbon-chain molecules like c-C3H2 is enhanced. Instead, on the\nside that is less exposed to the ISRF the C atoms are mostly locked in carbon\nmonoxide, CO, the precursor of methanol. Conclusions. We conclude that\nlarge-scale effects have a direct impact on the chemical segregation that we\ncan observe at core scale. However, the non-thermal mechanisms responsible for\nthe desorption of methanol in starless cores do not show any dependency on the\nH2 column density at the methanol peak.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2020 10:55:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-04"}

However, black holes with\nmasses within this \"high mass gap\" are expected to form as the remnants of\nbinary black hole mergers. These remnants can merge again dynamically in\ndensely populated environments such as globular clusters. The hypothesis that\nthe binary black hole merger GW190521 formed dynamically is supported by its\nhigh mass. Orbital eccentricity can also be a signature of dynamical formation,\nsince a binary that merges quickly after becoming bound may not circularize\nbefore merger. In this work, we measure the orbital eccentricity of GW190521.\nWe find that the data prefer a signal with eccentricity $e \\geq 0.1$ at 10 Hz\nto a non-precessing, quasi-circular signal, with a log Bayes factor $\\ln{\\cal\nB}=5.0$. When compared to precessing, quasi-circular analyses, the data prefer\na non-precessing, $e \\geq 0.1$ signal, with log Bayes factors $\\ln{\\cal\nB}\\approx2$. Using injection studies, we find that a non-spinning, moderately\neccentric ($e = 0.13$) GW190521-like binary can be mistaken for a\nquasi-circular, precessing binary. Conversely, a quasi-circular binary with\nspin-induced precession may be mistaken for an eccentric binary.

The combined action of the waves induced by the\nmigrating planet and drag back-reaction on the gas produces a complex evolution\nof the flux of pebbles. The waves excite zonal flows which act as dust traps,\nand accumulate pebbles. Owing to drag back-reaction, a Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstability develops, generating turbulent dust rings containing several Earth\nmasses of solids, where planetesimal formation is likely. The more massive the\nplanet, the faster the dust rings develop. In competition with planet\nmigration, this process triggers several dust rings, with a radial separation\nscaling as $1/M_p$. We discover a transition around $13$ Earth masses. Below\nthat, pebbles are stopped at the inner side of the planet's orbit, but pebble\naccretion on the planet is sustained. Above that, drag back-reaction in the\ndust ring region flattens the pressure profile while the planet migrates, which\nlimits further growth by pebble accretion. This new {\\it pebble isolation mass}\nis about a factor of 2 lower than often reported in the literature.

Classical conditioning is only valid with respect to\nevents of positive probability. If we ignore this constraint and condition on\nsuch sets, for example events of type $\\{Y=y\\}$ for a continuously distributed\nrandom variable $Y$, almost any probability measure can be chosen as the\nconditional measure on such sets. There have been numerous descriptions and\nexplanations of the paradox' appearance in the setting of conditioning on a\nsubset of probability zero.

Its magnetic field structure is quite complex\nand almost certainly of a dynamo origin. beta Cas' atmosphere is slightly\ndeficient in iron peak elements and slightly overabundant in C, O, and heavier\nelements. Atypically for delta Scuti stars, we can only detect three pulsation\nmodes down to exceptionally low noise levels for beta Cas. The star is also one\nof very few delta Scuti pulsators known to date to show a measurable magnetic\nfield, and the first delta Scuti star with a dynamo magnetic field. These\ncharacteristics make beta Cas an interesting target for future studies of\ndynamo processes in the thin convective envelopes of F-type stars, of the\ntransition region between fossil and dynamo fields, and the interaction between\npulsations and magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2020 11:36:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-11"}

We argue that while the recent datasets contain large sets of\nannotated videos that to some extent provide a large bandwidth for training\ndata, the hard scenarios such as occlusion and in-plane rotation are still\nunderrepresented. For trackers to be brought closer to the real-world scenarios\nand deployed in safety-critical devices, even the rarest hard scenarios must be\nproperly addressed. In this paper, we particularly focus on hard occlusion\ncases and benchmark the performance of recent state-of-the-art trackers (SOTA)\non them. We created a small-scale dataset containing different categories\nwithin hard occlusions, on which the selected trackers are evaluated. Results\nshow that hard occlusions remain a very challenging problem for SOTA trackers.\nFurthermore, it is observed that tracker performance varies wildly between\ndifferent categories of hard occlusions, where a top-performing tracker on one\ncategory performs significantly worse on a different category.

We demonstrate\nthat this automatic selection procedure provides close-to-optimal results in\nterms of accuracy, and significantly more robust solutions, while being more\ngeneral than the case-by-case recommendations obtained by the benchmark.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2020 12:13:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Mar 2021 11:25:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 23 Jul 2021 16:44:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-26"}

Knowledge of how this distribution evolves is of practical importance for\nmaritime and climate studies. The analytical framework developed in Part 1\nexamined how this evolution is governed by the bubble-mass flux from large to\nsmall bubble sizes, which depends on the rate of break-up events and the\ndistribution of child bubble sizes. These statistics are measured in Part 2 as\nensemble-averaged functions of time by simulating ensembles of breaking waves,\nand identifying and tracking individual bubbles and their break-up events. The\nbreak-up dynamics are seen to be statistically unsteady, and two intervals with\ndistinct characteristics were identified. In the first interval, the\ndissipation rate and bubble-mass flux are quasi-steady, and the theoretical\nanalysis of Part 1 is supported by all observed statistics, including the\nexpected -10/3 power-law exponent for the super-Hinze-scale size distribution.\nStrong locality is observed in the corresponding bubble-mass flux, supporting\nthe presence of a super-Hinze-scale break-up cascade. In the second interval,\nthe dissipation rate decays, and the bubble-mass flux increases as small- and\nintermediate-sized bubbles become more populous. This flux remains strongly\nlocal with cascade-like behaviour, but the dominant power-law exponent for the\nsize distribution increases to -8/3 as small bubbles are also depleted more\nquickly.

On the other hand, due to many different items, users cannot score a\nwide range of them, and usually, there is a scattering problem for the matrix\ncreated for users. To solve the problem, the trust-based recommender systems\nare applied to predict the score of the desired item for the user. Various\ncriteria have been considered to define trust, and the degree of trust between\nusers is usually calculated based on these criteria. In this regard, it is\nimpossible to obtain the degree of trust for all users because of the large\nnumber of them in social networks. Also, for this problem, researchers use\ndifferent modes of the Random Walk algorithm to randomly visit some users,\nstudy their behavior, and gain the degree of trust between them. In the present\nstudy, a trust-based recommender system is presented that predicts the score of\nitems that the target user has not rated, and if the item is not found, it\noffers the user the items dependent on that item that are also part of the\nuser's interests. In a trusted network, by weighting the edges between the\nnodes, the degree of trust is determined, and a TrustWalker is developed, which\nuses the Biased Random Walk (BRW) algorithm to move between the nodes. The\nweight of the edges is effective in the selection of random steps.

K clusters are\ngenerated in regular alpha-cages of zeolite A by the loading of guest K metal\nat a loading density of K atoms per alpha-cage, $n$. The value of $n$ was\nchanged from 0 to 7.2. It is known that this system shows ferromagnetic\nproperties for $n > 2$, where the Curie temperature increases with $n$, has a\npeak of approx,8 K at $n approx 3.6$, and decreases to 0 K at $n = 7.2$. The\nnegative Weiss temperature is estimated from the Curie-Weiss law for $n > 2$. A\nspherical quantum-well (SQW) model for the K cluster with 1$s$, 1$p$, and 1$d$\nquantum states has previously been proposed, and the ferromagnetic properties\nwere explained as being due to $s$-electrons in 1$p$ states. A spin-cant model\nof Mott-insulator antiferromagnetism in a K cluster array has been proposed for\nthe origin of the ferromagnetic properties. However, the SQW model cannot\nexplain either the $n$-dependence of the Curie temperature or that of the Curie\nconstant. In the present study, detailed measurements were made of the optical\nreflection, magnetic properties, electron spin resonance, and electrical\nresistivities. An optical reflection band at 0.7 eV is clearly observed for $2\n< n < 6$ at low temperatures, and is assigned to the excitation of the\nsigma-bonding state between 1$p$-states in adjoining alpha-cages. The\nelectrical resistivity indicates an insulating state continuously for $n$. We\npropose an advanced SQW model with consideration for sigma-bonding, the orbital\northogonality of 1$p$-hole states, and also the superlattice structure. We\nexplain the observed electronic properties using this model based on a\ncorrelated polaron system. We propose an enhancement effect of the\nDzyaloshinsky-Moriya (DM) interaction between adjoining $1p$ orbitals by the\nextension of the Rashba mechanism of spin-orbit interaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2020 12:56:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-11"}

Each TM clause\nvotes for or against a particular class, with classification resolved using a\nmajority vote. While the evaluation of clauses is fast, being based on binary\noperators, the voting makes it necessary to synchronize the clause evaluation,\nimpeding parallelization. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme for\ndesynchronizing the evaluation of clauses, eliminating the voting bottleneck.\nIn brief, every clause runs in its own thread for massive native parallelism.\nFor each training example, we keep track of the class votes obtained from the\nclauses in local voting tallies. The local voting tallies allow us to detach\nthe processing of each clause from the rest of the clauses, supporting\ndecentralized learning. This means that the TM most of the time will operate on\noutdated voting tallies. We evaluated the proposed parallelization across\ndiverse learning tasks and it turns out that our decentralized TM learning\nalgorithm copes well with working on outdated data, resulting in no significant\nloss in learning accuracy. Furthermore, we show that the proposed approach\nprovides up to 50 times faster learning.

Polarization measurements of the prompt emission of\nthese extreme phenomena have long been thought to be the key to answering a\nrange of these questions. The POLAR detector was designed to produce the first\nset of detailed and reliable polarization measurements in an energy range of\napproximately 50-500 keV. During late 2016 and early 2017, POLAR detected a\ntotal of 55 GRBs. Analysis results of 5 of these GRBs have been reported in the\npast. The results were found to be consistent with a low or unpolarized flux.\nHowever, previous reports by other collaborations found high levels of\npolarization. We study the polarization for all the 14 GRBs observed by POLAR\nfor which statistically robust inferences are possible. Additionally,\ntime-resolved polarization studies are performed on GRBs with sufficient\napparent flux. A publicly available polarization analysis tool, developed\nwithin the 3ML framework, was used to produce statistically robust results. The\nmethod allows to combine spectral and polarimetric data from POLAR with\nspectral data from the Fermi GBM and Swift-BAT to jointly model the spectral\nand polarimetric parameters. The time integrated analysis finds all results to\nbe compatible with a low or zero polarization with the caveat that, when\ntime-resolved analysis is possible within individual pulses, we observe\nmoderate polarization with a rapidly changing polarization angle. Thus,\ntime-integrated polarization results, while pointing to lower polarization are\npotentially an artifact of summing over the changing polarization signal and\nthus, washing out the true moderate polarization. Therefore, we caution against\nover interpretation of any time-integrated results and encourage one to wait\nfor more detailed polarization measurements from forthcoming missions such as\nPOLAR-2 and LEAP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2020 14:14:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-04"}

One major privacy attack in this domain is membership inference, where\nan adversary aims to determine whether a target data sample is part of the\ntraining set of a target ML model. So far, most of the current membership\ninference attacks are evaluated against ML models trained from scratch.\nHowever, real-world ML models are typically trained following the transfer\nlearning paradigm, where a model owner takes a pretrained model learned from a\ndifferent dataset, namely teacher model, and trains her own student model by\nfine-tuning the teacher model with her own data.\n  In this paper, we perform the first systematic evaluation of membership\ninference attacks against transfer learning models.

The excessively high barrier\nas well as the low quantum tunneling and thermodynamic probabilities hinder the\nformation of the defect by post-grown isomerization from the perfect to the\ndefected structure. This finding indicates that the defected ice is stable, and\nthe defect can be formed during the ice growth stage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2020 14:19:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-11"}

This model displays\nseveral remarkable features, which makes it an attractive paradigm to explain\nthe physical nature of biological subdiffusion. In particular, it combines\nviscoelasticity with distinct non-ergodic features. We extend this model to\nmake it suitable for the subdiffusion of lipids in disordered biological\nmembranes upon including the inertial effects. For lipids, the inertial effects\noccur in the range of picoseconds, and a power-law decaying viscoelastic memory\nextends over the range of several nanoseconds. Thus, in the absence of\ndisorder, diffusion would become normal on a time scale beyond this memory\nrange. However, both experimentally and in some molecular-dynamical\nsimulations, the time range of lipid subdiffusion extends far beyond the\nviscoelastic memory range. We study three 1d models of correlated quenched\nGaussian disorder to explain the puzzle: singular short-range (exponentially\ncorrelated), smooth short-range (Gaussian-correlated), and smooth long-range\n(power-law correlated) disorder. For a moderate disorder strength, transient\nviscoelastic subdiffusion changes into the subdiffusion caused by the\nrandomness of the environment. It is characterized by a time-dependent\npower-law exponent of subdiffusion, which can show nonmonotonous behavior, in\nagreement with some recent molecular-dynamical simulations. Moreover, the\nspatial distribution of test particles in this disorder-dominated regime is\nshown to be a non-Gaussian, exponential power distribution, which also\ncorrelates well with molecular-dynamical findings and experiments.

The properties of interest are halo shape\n(parametrized by its principal axes), spin and virialisation status, the\nalignment of halo spin and shape, as well as the shape-shape and spin-spin\nalignments among halo neighbours. Methods: We define the halo environment using\nthe notion of halo isolation status determined by the distance to its nearest\nneighbor. This defines a maximum spherical region around each halo devoid of\nother halos, above the catalog threshold mass. We consider as 'close halo\npairs', the pairs that are separated by a distance lower than a specific\nthreshold. In order to decontaminate our results from the known dependence of\nhalo dynamical properties on mass, we use a random sampling procedure in order\nto compare properties of similar halo abundance distributions. Results: (a) We\nfind a strong dependence of halo properties on their environment, confirming\nthat isolated halos are more aspherical and more prolate with lower spin\nvalues. (b) Correlations between halo properties exist and are mostly\nindependent of halo environment. (c) Halo spins are aligned with the minor\naxis, regardless of halo shape. (d) Close halo neighbors have their major axes\nstatistically aligned, while they show a slight but statistically significant\npreference for anti-parallel spin directions.

Wearable videos are a much more challenging\nscenario for object detection than standard images or even another type of\nvideos, due to lower quality images (e.g. poor focus) or high clutter and\nocclusion common in wearable recordings.

A widespread belief is that\nthe proper analysis of the low energy properties in this gauge requires the\nextension of the gauge-fixing procedure beyond the FP recipe. This manuscript\nreviews various applications of the Curci-Ferrari (CF) model, a\nphenomenological proposal for such an extension, based on the decoupling\nproperties of Landau gauge correlators as computed on the lattice. We\ninvestigate the predictions of the model concerning the deconfinement\ntransition of strongly interacting matter at finite temperature, first in the\ncase of pure Yang-Mills theory and then in the case of heavy-quark Quantum\nChromodynamics. We show that most qualitative aspects and also many\nquantitative features of the deconfinement transition can be accounted for\nwithin the CF model, with only one additional parameter, adjusted from\ncomparison to lattice simulations. Moreover, these features emerge in a\nsystematic and controlled perturbative expansion, as opposed to the ill-defined\nperturbative expansion within the FP model in the infrared. Applications at\nfinite temperature and/or density require one to consider a background\nextension of the Landau gauge, the so-called Landau-deWitt gauge. The\nmanuscript is also intended as a thorough but pedagogical introduction to these\ntechniques, including the rationale for introducing a background, the role of\nthe Weyl chambers, and the complications that emerge due to the sign problem in\nthe case of a real quark chemical potential. It also investigates the fate of\nthe correlation functions as computed in the CF model and conjectures a\nspecific behavior for the corresponding functions evaluated on the lattice, in\nthe case of the SU(2) gauge group.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2020 15:20:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-11"}

This\ngives rise to an LP algorithm in time poly$(n,m\\log\\Delta_A)$, where $\\Delta_A$\nis the largest subdeterminant of $A$. A significant extension to the real model\nof computation was given by Vavasis and Ye (Math. Prog.

Even\nthough the mass of the heavy quarks plays a subdominant role during the high\nvirtuality portion of the jet evolution, it does affect longitudinal drag and\ndiffusion, stimulating additional radiation from heavy quarks. These emissions\npartially compensate the reduction in radiation from the dead cone effect. In\nthe lower virtuality part of the shower, when the mass is comparable to the\ntransverse momenta of the partons, scattering and radiation processes off heavy\nquarks differ from those off light quarks.

In addition to our computed evolutionary tracks, we also study the\nstability of planetary atmospheres, showing that the atmospheres of light\nplanets can be completely removed within 1 Gyr, and that compact atmospheres\nhave a better survival rate. From a detailed comparison between our results and\nthe output of the previous-generation models, we show that coupling between\nthermal evolution and atmospheric evaporation considerably affects the thermal\nstate of atmospheres for low-mass planets and, consequently, changes the\nrelationship between atmospheric mass fraction and planetary parameters. We,\ntherefore, conclude that self-consistent consideration of the thermal evolution\nand atmospheric evaporation is of crucial importance for evolutionary modeling\nand a better characterization of planetary atmospheres. From our simulations,\nwe derive an analytical expression between the planetary radius and atmospheric\nmass fraction at different ages. In particular, we find that, for a given\nobserved planetary radius, the predicted atmospheric mass fraction changes as\nage^0.11.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2020 15:45:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-14"}

At energies much\nlower than Planck scale, trace dynamics reduces to quantum field theory. In the\npresent paper we explain that the correct understanding of spin requires us to\nformulate the theory in 8-D octonionic space. The automorphisms of the octonion\nalgebra, which belong to the smallest exceptional Lie group $G_2$, replace\nspace-time diffeomorphisms and internal gauge transformations, bringing them\nunder a common unified fold. Building on earlier work by other researchers on\ndivision algebras, we propose the Lorentz-weak unification at the Planck scale,\nthe symmetry group being the stabiliser group of the quaternions inside the\noctonions. This is one of the two maximal subgroups of $G_2$, the other one\nbeing $SU(3)$, the element preserver group of octonions. This latter group,\ncoupled with $U(1)_{em}$, describes the electro-colour symmetry, as shown\nearlier by Furey. We predict a new massless spin one boson [the Lorentz boson]\nwhich should be looked for in experiments. Our Lagrangian correctly describes\nthree fermion generations, through three copies of the group $G_2$, embedded in\nthe exceptional Lie group $F_4$. This is the unification group for the four\nfundamental interactions, and it also happens to be the automorphism group of\nthe exceptional Jordan algebra. Gravitation is shown to be an emergent\nclassical phenomenon. Whereas at the Planck scale, there is present a quantised\nversion of the Lorentz symmetry, mediated by the Lorentz boson.

The present work reports\ncomputations indicating that an analogous \"compact-stretched\" transition arises\nin the dynamics of a thin elastic sheet. Sheets of nominally circular, square\nor rectangular shape are simulated in planar and biaxial flows using a finite\nelement method for the sheet conformations and a regularized Stokeslet method\nfor the fluid flow. If a neo-Hookean constitutive model is used for the sheet\nelasticity, the sheets will stretch without bound once a critical extension\nrate, as characterized nondimensionally by a capillary number, is exceeded.\nNonlinear elasticity, represented with the Yeoh model, arrests the stretching,\nleading to a highly-stretched steady state once the critical capillary number\nis exceeded. For all shapes and in both planar and biaxial extension, a\nparameter regime exists in which both weakly stretched (compact) and strongly\nstretched states can be found, depending on initial conditions. I.e. this\nparameter regime displays bistability. As in the long-chain polymer case, the\nbistable behavior arises from the hydrodynamic interaction between distant\nelements of the sheet, and vanishes if these interactions are artificially\nscreened by use of a Brinkman model for the fluid motion. While the sheets can\ntransiently display wrinkled shapes, all final shapes in planar and biaxial\nextension are planar.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Sep 2020 16:23:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2020 23:00:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-09"}
