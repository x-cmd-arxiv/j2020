Keypoint detection differs from other visual tasks where\ncontrastive learning has been applied because the input is a set of images in\nwhich multiple keypoints are annotated. This requires the contrastive learning\nto be extended such that the keypoints are represented and detected\nindependently, which enables the contrastive loss to make the keypoint features\ndifferent from each other and from the background. Our approach has two\nbenefits: It enables us to exploit contrastive learning for keypoint detection,\nand by detecting each keypoint independently the detection becomes more robust\nto occlusion compared to holistic methods, such as stacked hourglass networks,\nwhich attempt to detect all keypoints jointly. Our CoKe framework introduces\nseveral technical innovations. In particular, we introduce: (i) A clutter bank\nto represent non-keypoint features; (ii) a keypoint bank that stores\nprototypical representations of keypoints to approximate the contrastive loss\nbetween keypoints; and (iii) a cumulative moving average update to learn the\nkeypoint prototypes while training the feature extractor. Our experiments on a\nrange of diverse datasets (PASCAL3D+, MPII, ObjectNet3D) show that our approach\nworks as well, or better than, alternative methods for keypoint detection, even\nfor human keypoints, for which the literature is vast. Moreover, we observe\nthat CoKe is exceptionally robust to partial occlusion and previously unseen\nobject poses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Sep 2020 16:00:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Sep 2020 01:32:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2020 16:22:35 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2022 08:56:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-06"}

This is done by\nassigning appropriate Markov switching priors for the time-varying\ncoefficients' variances, extending the previous work of Ishwaran and Rao\n(2005). Furthermore, we investigate different priors, including the common\nInverted gamma prior for the process variances, and other mixture prior\ndistributions such as Gamma priors for both the spike and the slab, which leads\nto a mixture of Normal-Gammas priors (Griffin ad Brown, 2010) for the\ncoefficients.

Here we study how stellar irradiation reduces the disk-driven torque\nand affects migration in more realistic 3D disks.\n  Methods. Using 3D hydrodynamic simulations with radiation transfer, we\ninvestigated the static torque acting on a single gap-opening planet embedded\nin a passively heated accretion disk.\n  Results. Our simulations confirm that a temperature inversion is established\nat the irradiated outer gap edge and the local increase of the scale height\nreduces the magnitude of the negative outer Lindblad torque.

In our model, as the core's density increases, it remains\nimmersed in a constant-density environment and so it accretes from this\nenvironment, increasing its mass and reducing its Jeans length. Assuming a\npower-law density profile $\\rho \\propto r^{-p}$, we compute the rate of change\nof the slope $p$, and show that the value $p=2$ is stationary, and furthermore,\nan attractor. The radial profile of the Jeans length scales as $r^{p/2}$,\nimplying that, for $p<2$, there is a radius below which the region is smaller\nthan its Jeans length, thus appearing gravitationally stable and in need of\npressure confinement, while, in reality, it is part of a larger-scale collapse\nand is undergoing compression by the infalling material. In this region, the\ninfall speed decreases towards the center, eventually becoming subsonic, thus\nappearing \"coherent\", without the need for turbulence dissipation. We present a\ncompilation of observational determinations of density profiles in dense cores\nand show that the distribution of their slopes peaks at $p \\sim 1.7$--1.9,\nsupporting the notion that the profile steepens over time. Finally, we discuss\nthe case of magnetic support in a core in which the field scales as $B \\propto\n\\rho^\\beta$. For the expected value of $\\beta = 2/3$, this implies that the\nmass to magnetic flux ratio also decreases towards the central parts of the\ncores, making them appear magnetically supported, while in reality they may be\npart of larger collapsing supercritical region. We conclude that local\nsignatures of either thermal or magnetic support are not conclusive evidence of\nstability, that the gravitational instability of a region must be established\nat the large scales, and that the prestellar stage of collapse is dynamic\nrather than quasistatic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Sep 2020 16:51:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2021 15:10:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2021 20:29:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-17"}

Some\nof these traffic rules may depend on multiple agents or time. Especially in\nsituations with traffic participants that interact densely, the interactions\nwith other agents need to be accounted for during planning. To study how\nmulti-agent and time-dependent traffic rules shall be modeled, a framework is\nneeded that restricts the behavior to rule-conformant actions during planning,\nand that can eventually evaluate the satisfaction of these rules. This work\npresents a method to model the conformance to traffic rules for interactive\nbehavior planning and to test the ramifications of the traffic rule\nformulations on metrics such as collision, progress, or rule violations. The\ninteractive behavior planning problem is formulated as a dynamic game and\nsolved using Monte Carlo Tree Search, for which we contribute a new method to\nintegrate history-dependent traffic rules into a decision tree. To study the\neffect of the rules, we treat it as a multi-objective problem and apply a\nrelaxed lexicographical ordering to the vectorized rewards. We demonstrate our\napproach in a merging scenario. We evaluate the effect of modeling and\ncombining traffic rules to the eventual compliance in simulation.

Although the quasi-1D ferromagnet\nCoNb$_2$O$_6$ has been put forward as the best material example of the\ntransverse field Ising model, it exhibits significant deviations from ideality.\nThrough a combination of THz spectroscopy and theory, we show that\nCoNb$_2$O$_6$ in fact is well described by a different model with strong bond\ndependent interactions, which we dub the {\\it twisted Kitaev chain}, as these\ninteractions share a close resemblance to a one-dimensional version of the\nintensely studied honeycomb Kitaev model. In this model the ferromagnetic\nground state of CoNb$_2$O$_6$ arises from the compromise between two distinct\nalternating axes rather than a single easy axis. Due to this frustration, even\nat zero applied field domain-wall excitations have quantum motion that is\ndescribed by the celebrated Su-Schriefer-Heeger model of polyacetylene. This\nleads to rich behavior as a function of field. Despite the anomalous domain\nwall dynamics, close to a critical transverse field the twisted Kitaev chain\nenters a universal regime in the Ising universality class. This is reflected by\nthe observation that the excitation gap in CoNb$_2$O$_6$ in the ferromagnetic\nregime closes at a rate precisely twice that of the paramagnet. This originates\nin the duality between domain walls and spin-flips and the topological\nconservation of domain wall parity.

The neutral excitations are (high-symmetry\ngroup) magnons, and their dispersion is analytically calculated in terms of the\nform factors of the active bands in TBG. The two-charge excitation energy and\nwavefunctions are also obtained, and a sufficient condition on the graphene\neigenstates for obtaining a Cooper-pair from Coulomb interactions is obtained.\nFor the actual TBG bands at the first magic angle, we can analytically show\nthat the Cooper pair binding energy is zero in all such projected Coulomb\nmodels, implying that either phonons and/or non-zero kinetic energy are needed\nfor superconductivity. Since the [Phys. Rev. Lett. 122, 246401] showed that the\nkinetic energy bounds on the superexchange energy are less $10^{-3}$ in Coulomb\nunits, the phonon mechanism becomes then very likely. If nonetheless the\nsuperconductivity is due to kinetic terms which render the bands non-flat, one\nprediction of our theory is that the highest $T_c$ would not occur at the\nhighest DOS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Sep 2020 18:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2020 03:14:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 17:03:59 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2022 04:57:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-29"}

Our modeling\nsuggests grain growth to sizes of at least 3 mm in the disk, possibly spurred\nby the recent outburst, and an ice line that has migrated inward to $0.2-0.3$\nau post-outburst. At 15 GHz, we detected significant emission over the expected\nthermal disk emission which we attribute primarily to stellar (gyro)synchrotron\nand free-free disk emission.

Multi-source domain adaptation (MSDA) aims to train a\nmodel using multiple source datasets different from a target dataset in the\nabsence of target data labels. MSDA is a crucial problem applicable to many\npractical cases where labels for the target data are unavailable due to privacy\nissues. Existing MSDA frameworks are limited since they align data without\nconsidering conditional distributions p(x|y) of each domain. They also miss a\nlot of target label information by not considering the target label at all and\nrelying on only one feature extractor. In this paper, we propose Ensemble\nMulti-source Domain Adaptation with Pseudolabels (EnMDAP), a novel method for\nmulti-source domain adaptation. EnMDAP exploits label-wise moment matching to\nalign conditional distributions p(x|y), using pseudolabels for the unavailable\ntarget labels, and introduces ensemble learning theme by using multiple feature\nextractors for accurate domain adaptation. Extensive experiments show that\nEnMDAP provides the state-of-the-art performance for multi-source domain\nadaptation tasks in both of image domains and text domains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Sep 2020 18:29:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-01"}

The idea of EGM is to approximate the density\nfunction of the noise distribution instead of approximating the truth function\ndirectly as usual. Unlike the classical maximum likelihood estimation that\nencourages equal importance of all observations and could be problematic in the\npresence of abnormal observations, EGM schemes can be interpreted from a\nminimum distance estimation viewpoint and allow the ignorance of those\nobservations. Furthermore, it is shown that several well-known robust nonconvex\nregression paradigms, such as Tukey regression and truncated least square\nregression, can be reformulated into this new framework. We then develop a\nlearning theory for EGM, by means of which a unified analysis can be conducted\nfor these well-established but not fully-understood regression approaches.\nResulting from the new framework, a novel interpretation of existing bounded\nnonconvex loss functions can be concluded. Within this new framework, the two\nseemingly irrelevant terminologies, the well-known Tukey's biweight loss for\nrobust regression and the triweight kernel for nonparametric smoothing, are\nclosely related.

General anesthesia can be accomplished by\ninhalation-based (volatile) or total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA). While their\neffects on post-operative symptoms have been investigated, little is known\nabout their influence on brain functionalities during the surgery itself. To\nassess differences 17 patients were divided to receive either volatile\nanesthesia (n=9), or TIVA (n=8). The level of anesthesia was kept to be equal\nin both groups. A single bipolar EEG electrode (Neurosteer system) was placed\non the participants foreheads. It presented real-time activity and collected\ntheir data during the surgery. The dependent variables included frequency bands\n(delta, theta, alpha, and beta), and three features (VC9, ST4, and A0)\npreviously extracted with the device and provided by Neurosteer. All surgeries\nwere uneventful, and all patients showed bispectral index (BIS) score less than\n60. Feature activity under volatile anesthesia (in comparison to TIVA) was\nsignificantly lower for the delta, theta and alpha frequency bands and for the\nthree features. Further analysis showed that the largest difference between\nanesthesia types was for feature A0. The EEG frequency bands and novel brain\nactivity features provide evidence that volatile anesthesia further reduces\ncomponents of brain activity in comparison to TIVA anesthesia. Specifically,\nA0, which previously showed a correlation with cognitive decline severity and\ncognitive load, exhibited the most prominent difference between anesthesia\ntypes. Together, this study suggests that measuring brain activity during\nanesthesia using sensitive features, enables revealing that different\nanesthesia types may affect brain activity differently, which could affect the\nrecovery from anesthesia, and consequently reduce post-operative cognitive\ndecline\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Sep 2020 19:11:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Dec 2021 20:22:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 15 Feb 2022 15:59:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-16"}

To this end, techniques based on voltage measurement have shown\npromise for estimating the lithium surface concentration of active material\nparticles, which is an important state for avoiding aging mechanisms such as\nlithium plating. However, methods relying on voltage often lead to large\nestimation errors when the model parameters change during aging.

This operation is of paramount importance since it is virtually\nimpossible to nominally perform any other operation without some degree of\nattitude control. Common methods used to detumble satellites usually involve\nmagnetic actuation, paired with different types of sensors which are used to\nprovide angular velocity feedback. This paper presents the adverse effects of\ntime-discretization on the stability of two detumbling algorithms. An extensive\nliterature review revealed that both algorithms achieve absolute stability for\nsystems involving continuous feedback and output. However, the physical\ncomponents involved impose limitations on the maximum frequency of the\nalgorithm, thereby making any such system inconceivable. This asserts the need\nto perform a discrete-time stability analysis, as it is better suited to\nreflect on the actual implementation and dynamics of these algorithms. The\npaper starts with the current theory and views on the stability of these\nalgorithms. The next sections describe the continuous and discrete-time\nstability analysis performed by the team and the conclusions derived from it.\nTheoretical investigation led to the discovery of multiple conditions on\nangular velocity and operating frequencies of the hardware, for which the\nalgorithms were unstable. These results were then verified through various\nsimulations on MATLAB and Python3.6.7. The paper concludes with a discussion on\nthe various instabilities posed by time-discretization and the conditions under\nwhich the detumbling algorithm would be infeasible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Sep 2020 20:15:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-01"}

It outlines rate-type and incremental variational principles for the\nfull thermomechanical coupling in gradient-extended dissipative materials. It\nis shown that these principles yield as Euler equations essentially the macro-\nand micro-balances as well as the energy equation. Starting point is the\nincorporation of the entropy and entropy rate as canonical arguments into\nconstitutive energy and dissipation functions, which additionally depend on the\ngradient-extended mechanical state and its rate, respectively. By means of\n(generalized) Legendre transformations, extended variational principles with\nthermal as well as mechanical driving forces can be constructed. On the thermal\nside, a rigorous distinction between the quantity conjugate to the entropy and\nthe quantity conjugate to the entropy rate is essential here. Formulations with\nmechanical driving forces are especially suitable when considering possibly\ntemperature-dependent threshold mechanisms.

These networks are very suitable\nfor modeling real-world social networks in which there is an assessment of one\nvertex toward other vertices. One of the main problems studied in this paper is\nprediction of edge weights in such networks. We introduce, for the first time,\na metric geometry approach to studying edge weight prediction in WDNs. We\nmodify a usual notion of WDNs, and introduce a new type of WDNs which we coin\nthe term \\textit{almost-weighted directed networks} (AWDNs). AWDNs can capture\nthe weight information of a network from a given training set. We then\nconstruct a class of metrics (or distances) for AWDNs which equips such\nnetworks with a metric space structure. Using the metric geometry structure of\nAWDNs, we propose modified $k$ nearest neighbors (kNN) methods and modified\nsupport-vector machine (SVM) methods which will then be used to predict edge\nweights in AWDNs. In many real-world datasets, in addition to edge weights, one\ncan also associate weights to vertices which capture information of vertices;\nassociation of weights to vertices especially plays an important role in graph\nembedding problems. Adopting a similar approach, we introduce two new types of\ndirected networks in which weights are associated to either a subset of origin\nvertices or a subset of terminal vertices .

A recent implicit\nsolvent model, IS-SPA, based on approximating the mean solvent force using the\nsuperposition approximation, provides a platform to achieve these goals. IS-SPA\nwas originally developed to handle non-polar solutes in the TIP3P water model\nbut can be extended to accurately treat polar solutes in other polar solvents.\nIn this manuscript, we demonstrate how to adapt IS-SPA to include the treatment\nof solvent orientation and long ranged electrostatics in a solvent of\nchloroform. The orientation of chloroform is approximated as that of an ideal\ndipole aligned in a mean electrostatic field. The solvent--solute force is then\nconsidered as an averaged radially symmetric Lennard-Jones component and a\nmultipole expansion of the electrostatic component through the octupole term.\nParameters for the model include atom-based solvent density and mean electric\nfield functions that are fit from explicit solvent simulations of independent\natoms or molecules. Using these parameters, IS-SPA accounts for asymmetry of\ncharge solvation and reproduces the explicit solvent potential of mean force of\ndimerization of two oppositely charged Lennard-Jones spheres with high\nfidelity. Additionally, the model more accurately captures the effect of\nexplicit solvent on the monomer and dimer configurations of alanine dipeptide\nin chloroform than a generalized Born or constant density dielectric model.

Chem.\nPhys. {\\bf 22}, 1420 (1954)] expresses the difference in Helmholtz free energy\nbetween a system of interest and that of a reference system as series of\ncumulants $\\kappa_n$ of the potential energy difference between the two\nsystems. This expansion has attractive features as a method for obtaining\nabsolute free energies for {\\it ab initio} potential energy surfaces. The\nseries is formally a power series in $\\beta=1/T$, suggesting that its\nusefulness may be limited to high temperature. However, for smooth reference\npotentials, the $T$-dependence of the $\\kappa_n$ contributes to the\nconvergence. A closed form expression is derived for the $\\kappa_n$ to all\norders for the case that both the system and reference potentials are harmonic.\nIn this case $\\kappa_n \\propto T^n$ for $n \\ge 2$ and the convergence of the\nseries is independent of temperature. More realistic cases of liquid Cu and\nsolid Al, with a $1/r^{12}$ and harmonic reference potential, respectively, are\ninvestigated numerically by evaluating the cumulants to third order using Monte\nCarlo integration. In all cases, the ratio of the third order to the second\norder term in the expansion is found to be $\\sim 0.1$, indicating good\nconvergence. Third order contributions to the free energy are typically a few\nmeV/atom, and comparable to their statistical errors. The statistical error in\nthe second order free energy of Al is 0.4 meV/atom with only 100 evaluations of\nthe {\\it ab initio} energy. These results suggest that the perturbation series\nallows for efficient and accurate evaluation of the free energy for condensed\nphases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Sep 2020 22:02:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-01"}

The entanglement of discrete\nand continuous behaviour inherent to such programs goes beyond the established\ncomputer science foundations, producing challenges related to e.g. infinite\niteration and combination of hybrid behaviour with other effects. A systematic\ntreatment of hybridness as a dedicated computational effect has emerged\nrecently. In particular, a generic idealized functional language HybCore with a\nsound and adequate operational semantics has been proposed. The latter\nsemantics however did not provide hints to implementing HybCore as a runnable\nlanguage, suitable for hybrid system simulation (e.g. the semantics features\nrules with uncountably many premises). We introduce an imperative counterpart\nof HybCore, whose semantics is simpler and runnable, and yet intimately related\nwith the semantics of HybCore at the level of hybrid monads. We then establish\na corresponding soundness and adequacy theorem. To attest that the resulting\nsemantics can serve as a firm basis for the implementation of typical tools of\nprogramming oriented to the hybrid domain, we present a web-based prototype\nimplementation to evaluate and inspect hybrid programs, in the spirit of GHCi\nfor Haskell and UTop for OCaml. The major asset of our implementation is that\nit formally follows the operational semantic rules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Sep 2020 22:03:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-01"}

The results show that the TGFs occur during strong initial\nbreakdown pulses (IBPs) in the first few milliseconds of negative\ncloud-to-ground and low-altitude intracloud flashes, and that the IBPs are\nproduced by a newly-identified streamer-based discharge process called fast\nnegative breakdown. The observations indicate the relativistic runaway electron\navalanches (RREAs) responsible for producing the TGFs are initiated by embedded\nspark-like transient conducting events (TCEs) within the fast streamer system,\nand potentially also by individual fast streamers themselves. The TCEs are\ninferred to be the cause of impulsive sub-pulses that are characteristic\nfeatures of classic IBP sferics. Additional development of the avalanches would\nbe facilitated by the enhanced electric field ahead of the advancing front of\nthe fast negative breakdown. In addition to showing the nature of IBPs and\ntheir enigmatic sub-pulses, the observations also provide a possible\nexplanation for the unsolved question of how the streamer to leader transition\noccurs during the initial negative breakdown, namely as a result of strong\ncurrents flowing in the final stage of successive IBPs, extending backward\nthrough both the IBP itself and the negative streamer breakdown preceding the\nIBP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Sep 2020 22:24:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Oct 2020 20:28:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}

In an arms race against these\ncounter-measures, the tracking providers developed a new technique called CNAME\ncloaking based tracking to avoid issues with browsers that block third-party\ncookies and requests. To detect this tracking technique, browser extensions\nrequire on-demand DNS lookup APIs.

Our goal\nis to detect both sites and requests linked to CNAME cloaking-related tracking.\nWe crawl a list of target sites and store all HTTP/HTTPS requests with their\nattributes. Then we label all instances automatically by looking up CNAME\nrecord of subdomain, and applying wildcard matching based on well-known\ntracking filter lists. After extracting features, we build a supervised\nclassification model to distinguish site and request related to CNAME\ncloaking-based tracking. Our evaluation shows that the proposed approach\noutperforms well-known tracking filter lists: F1 scores of 0.790 for sites and\n0.885 for requests. By analyzing the feature permutation importance, we\ndemonstrate that the number of scripts and the proportion of XMLHttpRequests\nare discriminative for detecting sites, and the length of URL request is\nhelpful in detecting requests. Finally, we analyze concept drift by using the\n2018 dataset to train a model and obtain a reasonable performance on the 2020\ndataset for detecting both sites and requests using CNAME cloaking-based\ntracking.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Sep 2020 22:33:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-01"}

The TRS broken WSM yields one left and one right chiral\nWeyl nodes (WNs) while there are two left and right chiral WNs for TRS\ninvariant WSM. We show that these features can potentially cause the\nquantization of CPG response at higher values compared to the topological\ncharge of the underlying WSM. This is further supported by the fact that Berry\ncurvature and velocity behave differently whether the system preserves or\nbreaks the TRS. We find the CPG responses for TRS invariant type-II WSM to be\nquantized at two and four times the topological charge of the activated WNs\nwhile the chemical potential are respectively chosen in the vicinity of\nenergies associated with left and right chiral WNs. By contrast, irrespective\nof the above choice of the chemical potential, the quantization in CPG response\nis directly given by the topological charge of the activated WNs for TRS broken\ncase. Interestingly, we notice non-quantized peak in CPG response when energies\nof WNs associated with opposite chiralities are close to each other as it is\nthe case for TRS invariant type-I WSM considered here. Moreover, we show that\nthe tilt can significantly modify the CPG response as velocity in the tilt\ndirection changes which enters into the CPG tensor through the Fermi\ndistribution function. Given these exciting outcomes, the second order CPG\nresponse emerges as a useful indicator to characterize the system under\nconsideration. Furthermore, we investigate the momentum resolved structure of\nCPG response to relate with the final results and strengthen our analysis from\nthe perspective of the lattice models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Sep 2020 22:45:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 2021 15:06:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-29"}

Important examples\ninclude photon-mediated interactions between atoms, superconducting qubits, and\ncolor centers in diamond, and phonon-mediated interactions between trapped ions\nand between optical and microwave photons.

The main advantage of a parametric technique is the\ngeneralization of handling new data, which is particularly beneficial for\nstreaming data exploration. However, training a neural network to optimize the\nt-SNE objective function frequently fails. Previous methods overcome this\nproblem by pre-training and then fine-tuning the network. We found that the\ntraining failure comes from the gradient exploding problem, which occurs when\ndata points distant in high-dimensional space are projected to nearby embedding\npositions. Accordingly, we applied the gradient clipping method to solve the\nproblem. Since the networks are trained by directly optimizing the t-SNE\nobjective function, our method achieves an embedding quality that is compatible\nwith the non-parametric t-SNE while enjoying the ability of generalization. Due\nto mini-batch network training, our parametric dimension reduction method is\nhighly efficient.

In the proposed game, the evader aims to\ndelay (or, if possible, avoid) capture by any of the pursuers whereas each\npursuer tries to capture the latter only if this is to his best interest. Our\napproach resembles in principle the so-called relay pursuit strategy introduced\nin [1], in which only the pursuer that can capture the evader faster than the\nothers is active. In sharp contrast with the latter approach, the active\npursuer herein is not determined by a reactive ad-hoc rule but from the\nsolution of a corresponding potential game. We assume that each pursuer has\ndifferent capabilities and his decision whether to go after the evader or not\nis based on the maximization of his individual utility (conditional on the\nchoices and actions of the other pursuers). The pursuers' utilities depend on\nboth the rewards that they will receive by capturing the evader and the time of\ncapture (cost of capturing the evader) so that a pursuer should only seek\ncapture when the incurred cost is relatively small. The determination of the\nactive pursuer-evader assignments (in other words, which pursuers should be\nactive) is done iteratively by having the pursuers exchange information and\nupdating their own actions by executing a learning algorithm for games known as\nSpatial Adaptive Play (SAP). We illustrate the performance of our algorithm by\nmeans of extensive numerical simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Sep 2020 03:21:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-19"}

To\nconverge the strength of both methods, we propose to prune the filter in the\nfilter. Specifically, we treat a filter $F \\in \\mathbb{R}^{C\\times K\\times K}$\nas $K \\times K$ stripes, i.e., $1\\times 1$ filters $\\in \\mathbb{R}^{C}$, then\nby pruning the stripes instead of the whole filter, we can achieve finer\ngranularity than traditional FP while being hardware friendly.

As some recent work has shown that the pruned architecture is\nmore crucial than the inherited important weights, we argue that the\narchitecture of a single filter, i.e., the shape, also matters.

Given a large model (i.e., teacher model), it aims to improve the\nperformance of a compact model (i.e., student model) by transferring the\ninformation from the teacher. Various information for distillation has been\nstudied. Recently, a number of works propose to transfer the pairwise\nsimilarity between examples to distill relative information. However, most of\nefforts are devoted to developing different similarity measurements, while only\na small matrix consisting of examples within a mini-batch is transferred at\neach iteration that can be inefficient for optimizing the pairwise similarity\nover the whole data set. In this work, we aim to transfer the full similarity\nmatrix effectively. The main challenge is from the size of the full matrix that\nis quadratic to the number of examples. To address the challenge, we decompose\nthe original full matrix with Nystr{\\\"{o}}m method. By selecting appropriate\nlandmark points, our theoretical analysis indicates that the loss for transfer\ncan be further simplified. Concretely, we find that the difference between the\noriginal full kernel matrices between teacher and student can be well bounded\nby that of the corresponding partial matrices, which only consists of\nsimilarities between original examples and landmark points. Compared with the\nfull matrix, the size of the partial matrix is linear in the number of\nexamples, which improves the efficiency of optimization significantly.

To maintain reliable operation under this paradigm,\nhowever, future grids with deep DER penetrations would require costly equipment\nupgrades. These upgrades can be mitigated via judicious coordination of DER\noperation. Earlier work has assumed a hierarchical control architecture in\nwhich a global controller (GC) uses detailed power injection and DER data and\nknowledge of DER owners' objectives to determine setpoints that local\ncontrollers should follow in order to achieve reliable and cost effective grid\noperation. Having such data and assuming knowledge of DER owners' objectives,\nhowever, are often not desirable or possible. In an earlier work, a 2-layer DER\ncoordination architecture was shown to achieve close to optimal performance\ndespite infrequent communication to a global controller. Motivated by this\nwork, this paper proposes a day-ahead coordination scheme that uses forecasted\npower profile ranges to generate day-ahead dynamic power rating bounds at each\ntransformer. Novel features of this scheme include: (i) the GC knows only past\nnode power injection data and does not impose or know DER owner objectives,\n(ii) we use bounds that ensure reliable operation to guide the local\ncontrollers rather than setpoint tracking, and (iii) we consider electric\nvehicle (EV) charging in addition to storage.

To estimate the nuisance models, we separately consider the use\nof high dimensional (HD) sparse parametric models and more general (typically\nnonparametric) machine learning (ML) methods.

In\nthis paper, we learn image-adaptive 3-dimensional lookup tables (3D LUTs) to\nachieve fast and robust photo enhancement. 3D LUTs are widely used for\nmanipulating color and tone of photos, but they are usually manually tuned and\nfixed in camera imaging pipeline or photo editing tools.

We learn multiple basis 3D LUTs\nand a small convolutional neural network (CNN) simultaneously in an end-to-end\nmanner. The small CNN works on the down-sampled version of the input image to\npredict content-dependent weights to fuse the multiple basis 3D LUTs into an\nimage-adaptive one, which is employed to transform the color and tone of source\nimages efficiently.

There is a plethora of matrix products and graph problems\nwhose complexity seems to lie in the middle of these two problems. For\ninstance, the Min-Max matrix product, the Minimum Witness matrix product, APSP\nin directed unweighted graphs and determining whether an edge-colored graph\ncontains a monochromatic triangle, can all be solved in $\\tilde\nO(n^{(3+\\omega)/2})$ time.

As a step in this direction we refine Inozemtsev's `extended\ncoordinate Bethe ansatz' and clarify various aspects of the model's exact\nspectrum and its limits.\n  We identify quasimomenta in terms of which the $M$-particle energy is close\nto being (functionally) additive, as one would expect from the limiting models;\nour expression is additive iff the energy of the elliptic Calogero-Sutherland\nsystem is so.

The\nobservable CO luminosity is translated to H_2 mass via a conversion factor,\nX_CO, which is a source of uncertainty and bias. Despite variations in X_CO,\nthe empirically-determined solar neighborhood value is often applied across\ndifferent galactic environments. To improve understanding of X_CO, we employ 3D\nmagnetohydrodynamics simulations of the interstellar medium (ISM) in galactic\ndisks with a large range of gas surface densities, allowing for varying\nmetallicity, far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation, and cosmic ray ionization rate\n(CRIR). With the TIGRESS simulation framework we model the three-phase ISM with\nself-consistent star formation and feedback, and post-process outputs with\nchemistry and radiation transfer to generate synthetic CO(1--0) and (2--1)\nmaps. Our models reproduce the observed CO excitation temperatures,\nline-widths, and line ratios in nearby disk galaxies.

X_CO also decreases at higher CRIR, and is\ninsensitive to the FUV radiation. As density increases, X_CO first decreases\ndue to increasing excitation temperature, and then increases when the emission\nis fully saturated. We provide fits between X_CO and observable quantities such\nas the line ratio, peak antenna temperature, and line brightness, which probe\nlocal gas conditions.

The European\nframework for Integrated Modelling (EU-IM), facilitates the integration of\ndifferent plasma simulation tools by providing a standard data structure for\ncommunication that enables relatively easy integration of different physics\ncodes. A three-level modelling approach was adopted for runaway electron\nsimulations within the EU-IM. Recently, a number of runaway electron modelling\nmodules have been integrated into this framework. The first level of modelling\n(Runaway Indicator) is limited to the indication if runaway electron generation\nis possible or likely. The second level (Runaway Fluid) adopts an approach\nsimilar to e.g. the GO code, using analytical formulas to estimate changes in\nthe runaway electron current density. The third level is based on the solution\nof the electron kinetics. One such code is LUKE that can handle the\ntoroidicity-induced effects by solving the bounce-averaged Fokker-Planck\nequation. Another approach is used in NORSE, which features a fully nonlinear\ncollision operator that makes it capable of simulating major changes in the\nelectron distribution, for example slide-away. Both codes handle the effect of\nradiation on the runaway distribution. These runaway-electron modelling codes\nare in different stages of integration into the EU-IM infrastructure, and into\nthe European Transport Simulator (ETS), which is a fully capable modular 1.5D\ncore transport simulator.

Giovanni Battista Donati, director of the Specola of Florence from\nthe eve of the Italian Unification in 1859, finally succeeded in creating a new\nobservatory: first, he obtained funds from the Parliament of the Kingdom of\nItaly to build an equatorial mount for the Amici 28-cm refractor, which could\nnot be installed conveniently in the tower of the Specola; then, he went\nthrough the process of selecting a proper site, seeking funds and finally\nbuilding Arcetri Observatory. Although Donati was a pioneer of spectroscopy and\nastrophysics, his intent was to establish a modern observatory for classical\nastronomy, as the Italian peninsula did not have a national observatory like\nthose located in many foreign capitals - Florence was the capital of the\nKingdom of Italy from 1865 to 1871. To promote the project, Donati made use of\nwritings by one of the most authoritative European astronomers, Otto Wilhelm\nStruve. The paper describes all these steps, eventually leading to the final\ninauguration of the Arcetri Observatory in 1872, almost 150 years ago.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Sep 2020 13:39:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Dec 2020 15:55:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-29"}

In this paper, we focus on\nknowledge transfer from monolin-gual ASR to cross-lingual VC, in order to\naddress the con-tent mismatch problem. To achieve this, we first train a\nmonolingual acoustic model for the source language, use it to extract phonetic\nfeatures for all the speech in the VC dataset, and then train a Seq2Seq\nconversion model to pre-dict the mel-spectrograms.

Harnessing and controlling these effects is a\nmajor challenge, on which key advances are being made through lattice and\nstrain engineering in thin films and heterostructures, leveraging the complex\ninterplay between electronic and structural degrees of freedom. Here we show\nthat the electronic structure of LaNiO3 can be tuned by means of lattice\nengineering. We use different substrates to induce compressive and tensile\nbiaxial epitaxial strain in LaNiO3 thin films. Our measurements reveal\nsystematic changes of the optical spectrum as a function of strain and,\nnotably, an increase of the low-frequency free carrier weight as tensile strain\nis applied. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we show that\nthis apparently counter-intuitive effect is due to a change of orientation of\nthe oxygen octahedra.The calculations also reveal drastic changes of the\nelectronic structure under strain, associated with a Fermi surface Lifshitz\ntransition. We provide an online applet to explore these effects. The\nexperimental value of integrated spectral weight below 2 eV is significantly\n(up to a factor of 3) smaller than the DFT results, indicating a transfer of\nspectral weight from the infrared to energies above 2 eV. The suppression of\nthe free carrier weight and the transfer of spectral weight to high energies\ntogether indicate a correlation-induced band narrowing and free carrier mass\nenhancement due to electronic correlations. Our findings provide a promising\navenue for the tuning and control of quantum materials employing lattice\nengineering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Sep 2020 14:08:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-02"}

With\nthis tremendous rise in deep learning adoption comes questions about the\ntrustworthiness of the deep neural networks that power these applications.\nMotivated to answer such questions, there has been a very recent interest in\ntrust quantification. In this work, we introduce the concept of trust matrix, a\nnovel trust quantification strategy that leverages the recently introduced\nquestion-answer trust metric by Wong et al. to provide deeper, more detailed\ninsights into where trust breaks down for a given deep neural network given a\nset of questions. More specifically, a trust matrix defines the expected\nquestion-answer trust for a given actor-oracle answer scenario, allowing one to\nquickly spot areas of low trust that needs to be addressed to improve the\ntrustworthiness of a deep neural network. The proposed trust matrix is simple\nto calculate, humanly interpretable, and to the best of the authors' knowledge\nis the first to study trust at the actor-oracle answer level. We further extend\nthe concept of trust densities with the notion of conditional trust densities.\nWe experimentally leverage trust matrices to study several well-known deep\nneural network architectures for image recognition, and further study the trust\ndensity and conditional trust densities for an interesting actor-oracle answer\nscenario. The results illustrate that trust matrices, along with conditional\ntrust densities, can be useful tools in addition to the existing suite of trust\nquantification metrics for guiding practitioners and regulators in creating and\ncertifying deep learning solutions for trusted operation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Sep 2020 14:33:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-01"}

However, state-of-the-art block-based image\ncompressive sensing (BCS) methods generally suffer from two issues. The\nsparsifying domain and the sensing matrices widely used for image acquisition\nare not data-driven, and thus both the features of the image and the\nrelationships among subblock images are ignored. Moreover, doing so requires\naddressing high-dimensional optimization problems with extensive computational\ncomplexity for image reconstruction. In this paper, we provide a deep learning\nstrategy for BCS, called AutoBCS, which takes the prior knowledge of images\ninto account in the acquisition step and establishes a subsequent\nreconstruction model for performing fast image reconstruction with a low\ncomputational cost. More precisely, we present a learning-based sensing matrix\n(LSM) derived from training data to accomplish image acquisition, thereby\ncapturing and preserving more image characteristics than those captured by\nexisting methods. In particular, the generated LSM is proven to satisfy the\ntheoretical requirements of compressive sensing, such as the so-called\nrestricted isometry property.

Using plausible tidal parameters\nfrom the solar system, we find that four out of six systems would either\ntidally disrupt their exomoons or lose them to outward migration within the\nsystem lifetimes. The remaining two systems (KOI 268.01 and KOI 1888.01) could\nhost exomoons that are within 25 R$_{\\rm p}$ and less than $\\sim$3% of the host\nplanet's mass. However, a recent independent transit timing analysis by Kipping\n(2020) found that these systems fail rigorous statistical tests to validate\nthem as candidates. Overall, we find the presence of exomoons in these systems\nthat are large enough for TTV signatures to be unlikely given the combined\nconstraints of observational modeling, tidal migration, and orbital stability.\nSoftware to reproduce our results is available in the GitHub repository:\nMultiversario/satcand.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Sep 2020 15:01:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-13"}

If the dominant communication direction is\nblocked by an obstacle, an alternative and reliable spatial communication path\nshould be quickly identified to maintain connectivity. In this paper, we\nintroduce a new metric to quantify the effective multipath richness (EMR) of a\ndirectional communication channel by considering the strength and spatial\ndiversity of the resolved paths, while also taking into account beamwidth and\nblockage characteristics. The metric is defined as a weighted sum of the number\nof multipath component (MPC) clusters, where clustering is performed based on\nthe cosine-distance between the MPCs that have power above a certain threshold.\nThis process returns a single scalar value for a transmitter (TX)/receiver (RX)\nlocation pair in a given environment. It is also possible to represent the EMR\nof the whole environment with a probability distribution function of the metric\nby considering a set of TX/RX locations. Using this proposed metric, one can\nassess the scattering richness of different communication environments to\nachieve a particular quality of service (QoS). This metric is especially\ninformative and useful at higher frequencies, such as mmWave and terahertz\n(THz), where the propagation path loss and penetration loss are high, and\ndirectional non-light-of-sight (NLOS) communication is critical for the success\nof the network.

Annealing at successively higher\ntemperatures decreases the overall PL yield and UV intensity at nearly the same\nrates, indicating the increase in formation of at least one non-radiative\ndefect type. Simultaneously, the PL yield ratios of blue/UV and green/UV\nincrease, suggesting that defects associated with these emissions increase in\nconcentration with O2 annealing. Utilizing the different absorption\ncoefficients of 240 and 266 nm polarization-dependent excitation, we find an\noverall activation energy for the generation of non-radiative defects of 0.69\neV in the bulk but 1.55 eV near the surface. We also deduce activation energies\nfor the green emission-related defects of 0.60 eV near the surface and\n0.89-0.92 eV through the films, whereas the blue-related defects have\nactivation energy in the range 0.43-0.62 eV for all depths. Lastly, we observe\nhillock surface morphologies and Cr diffusion from the substrate into the film\nfor temperatures above 1050 oC. These observations are consistent with the\nformation and diffusion of VGa and its complexes as a dominant process during\nO2 annealing, but further work will be necessary to determine which defects and\ncomplexes provide radiative and non-radiative recombination channels and the\ndetailed kinetic processes occurring at surfaces and in bulk amongst defect\npopulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Sep 2020 15:28:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-01"}

Recent\nadvancements in deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures have\nboosted significantly the performance of face recognition based on\ntwo-dimensional (2D) facial texture images and outperformed the previous state\nof the art using conventional methods. However, the accuracy of 2D face\nrecognition is still challenged by the change of pose, illumination, make-up,\nand expression. On the other hand, the geometric information contained in\nthree-dimensional (3D) face data has the potential to overcome the fundamental\nlimitations of 2D face data.\n  We propose a multi-Channel deep 3D face network for face recognition based on\n3D face data. We compute the geometric information of a 3D face based on its\npiecewise-linear triangular mesh structure and then conformally flatten\ngeometric information along with the color from 3D to 2D plane to leverage the\nstate-of-the-art deep CNN architectures. We modify the input layer of the\nnetwork to take images with nine channels instead of three only such that more\ngeometric information can be explicitly fed to it. We pre-train the network\nusing images from the VGG-Face \\cite{Parkhi2015} and then fine-tune it with the\ngenerated multi-channel face images. The face recognition accuracy of the\nmulti-Channel deep 3D face network has achieved 98.6.

However, these samples often tend to contain incorrect labels (i.e.\nnoisy labels), which will significantly degrade the network performance. In\nthis paper, the attention-aware noisy label learning approach ($A^2NL$) is\nproposed to improve the discriminative capability of the network trained on\ndatasets with potential label noise. Specifically, a Noise-Attention model,\nwhich contains multiple noise-specific units, is designed to better capture\nnoisy information. Each unit is expected to learn a specific noisy distribution\nfor a subset of images so that different disturbances are more precisely\nmodeled. Furthermore, a recursive learning process is introduced to strengthen\nthe learning ability of the attention network by taking advantage of the\nlearned high-level knowledge. To fully evaluate the proposed method, we conduct\nexperiments from two aspects: manually flipped label noise on large-scale image\nclassification datasets, including CIFAR-10, SVHN; and real-world label noise\non an online crawled clothing dataset with multiple attributes. The superior\nresults over state-of-the-art methods validate the effectiveness of our\nproposed approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Sep 2020 15:45:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-01"}

We find that the polarisation pattern observed in the\nregion is likely to have been significantly altered by the radiation field of\nthe $>10^{4}$ L$_{\\odot}$ high-mass protostar Orion Source I. In the\nprotostar's optically thick disc, polarisation is likely to arise from dust\nself-scattering. In material to the south of Source I - previously identified\nas a region of 'anomalous' polarisation emission - we observe a polarisation\ngeometry concentric around Source I. We demonstrate that Source I's extreme\nluminosity may be sufficient to make the radiative precession timescale shorter\nthan the Larmor timescale for moderately large grains ($> 0.005-0.1\\,\\mu$m),\ncausing them to precess around the radiation anisotropy vector (k-RATs) rather\nthan the magnetic field direction (B-RATs). This requires relatively unobscured\nemission from Source I, supporting the hypothesis that emission in this region\narises from the cavity wall of the Source I outflow. This is one of the first\ntimes that evidence for k-RAT alignment has been found outside of a\nprotostellar disc or AGB star envelope. Alternatively, the grains may remain\naligned by B-RATs and trace gas infall onto the Main Ridge.

The existing crowd simulators require fully-modeled\n3D environments and enough time to prepare and simulate scenarios, where the\ndistribution and behavior of the crowd needs to be controlled. In addition, its\npopulation, routes or even doors and passages may change, so the 3D model and\nconfigurations have to be updated accordingly. This is a time-consuming task\nthat commonly has to be addressed within the crowd simulators. With that in\nmind, we present a novel approach to estimate the resulting data of a given\nevacuation scenario without actually simulating it. For such, we divide the\nenvironment into smaller modular rooms with different configurations, in a\ndivide-and-conquer fashion. Next, we train an artificial neural network to\nestimate all required data regarding the evacuation of a single room. After\ncollecting the estimated data from each room, we develop a heuristic capable of\naggregating per-room information so the full environment can be properly\nevaluated. Our method presents an average error of 5% when compared to\nevacuation time in a real-life environment. Our crowd estimator approach has\nseveral advantages, such as not requiring to model the 3D environment, nor\nlearning how to use and configure a crowd simulator, which means any user can\neasily use it. Furthermore, the computational time to estimate evacuation data\n(inference time) is virtually zero, which is much better even when compared to\nthe best-case scenario in a real-time crowd simulator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Sep 2020 14:42:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-02"}

The studies show that carriers with mild or no\nsymptoms are the main contributors to the transmission of a virus within the\npopulation. The average time it takes to develop the symptoms causes a delay in\nthe spread dynamics of the disease. When considering the influence of delay on\nthe disease propagation in epidemic networks, depending on the value of the\ntime-delay and the network topology, the peak of epidemic could be considerably\ndifferent in time, duration, and intensity. Motivated by the recent worldwide\noutbreak of the COVID-19 virus and the topological extent in which this virus\nhas spread over the course of a few months, this study aims to highlight the\neffect of time-delay in the progress of such infectious diseases in the\nmeta-population networks rather than individuals or a single population. In\nthis regard, the notions of epidemic network centrality in terms of the\nunderlying interaction graph of the network, structure of the uncertainties,\nand symptom development duration are investigated to establish a\ncentrality-based analysis of the disease evolution. A convex traffic volume\noptimization method is then developed to control the outbreak. The control\nprocess is done by identifying the sub-populations with the highest centrality\nand then isolating them while maintaining the same overall traffic volume\n(motivated by economic considerations) in the meta-population level.

In\norder to coherently compare Germany and Brazil evolutions with same population\napplying same task, we performed the pedestrian Fundamental Diagram experiment\nin Brazil, as performed in Germany. We use CNNs to detect and track people in\nvideo sequences. With this data, we use Voronoi Diagrams to find out the\nneighbor relation among people and then compute the walking distances to find\nout the personal spaces. Based on personal spaces analyses, we found out that\npeople behavior is more similar, in terms of their behaviours, in high dense\npopulations and vary more in low and medium densities. So, we focused our study\non cultural differences between the two Countries in low and medium densities.\nResults indicate that personal space analyses can be a relevant feature in\norder to understand cultural aspects in video sequences. In addition to the\ncultural differences, we also investigate the personality model in crowds,\nusing OCEAN. We also proposed a way to simulate the FD experiment from other\ncountries using the OCEAN psychological traits model as input. The simulated\ncountries were consistent with the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Sep 2020 14:44:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-26"}
