This is especially\nproblematic because datasets used for training large LMs usually contain\nsignificant toxicity, hate, bias, and negativity. We propose GeDi as an\nefficient method for using smaller LMs as generative discriminators to guide\ngeneration from large LMs to make them safer and more controllable. GeDi guides\ngeneration at each step by computing classification probabilities for all\npossible next tokens via Bayes rule by normalizing over two class-conditional\ndistributions; one conditioned on the desired attribute, or control code, and\nanother conditioned on the undesired attribute, or anti control code. We find\nthat GeDi gives stronger controllability than the state of the art method while\nalso achieving generation speeds more than 30 times faster. Additionally,\ntraining GeDi on only four topics allows us to controllably generate new topics\nzero-shot from just a keyword, unlocking a new capability that previous\ncontrollable generation methods do not have. Lastly, we show that GeDi can make\nGPT-2 (1.5B parameters) significantly less toxic without sacrificing linguistic\nquality, making it by far the most practical existing method for detoxifying\nlarge language models while maintaining a fast generation speed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 2020 17:45:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Oct 2020 14:14:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-23"}

This is part of the governing equation\nin the massively parallel particle-in-cell code, XGC, which is used to study\nturbulence in fusion energy devices. The neural network emphasizes\nphysics-inspired learning, where it is taught to respect physical conservation\nconstraints of the collision operator by including them in the training loss,\nalong with the L2 loss. In particular, network architectures used for the\ncomputer vision task of semantic segmentation have been used for training. A\npenalization method is used to enforce the \"soft\" constraints of the system and\nintegrate error in the conservation properties into the loss function. During\ntraining, quantities representing the density, momentum, and energy for all\nspecies of the system is calculated at each configuration vertex, mirroring the\nprocedure in XGC. This simple training has produced a median relative loss,\nacross configuration space, on the order of 10E-04, which is low enough if the\nerror is of random nature, but not if it is of drift nature in timesteps. The\nrun time for the Picard iterative solver of the operator scales as order n\nsquared, where n is the number of plasma species. As the XGC1 code begins to\nattack problems including a larger number of species, the collision operator\nwill become expensive computationally, making the neural network solver even\nmore important, since the training only scales as n. A wide enough range of\ncollisionality is considered in the training data to ensure the full domain of\ncollision physics is captured.

There are three key technical\nchallenges: capturing the correlations among attributes, avoiding the curse of\ndimensionality, and dealing with the large domains of attributes. None of the\nexisting approaches satisfactorily deals with all three challenges. Overcoming\nthese three challenges, we first propose an approach called Two-Dimensional\nGrids (TDG). Its main idea is to carefully use binning to partition the\ntwo-dimensional (2-D) domains of all attribute pairs into 2-D grids that can\nanswer all 2-D range queries and then estimate the answer of a higher\ndimensional range query from the answers of the associated 2-D range queries.\nHowever, in order to reduce errors due to noises, coarse granularities are\nneeded for each attribute in 2-D grids, losing fine-grained distribution\ninformation for individual attributes. To correct this deficiency, we further\npropose Hybrid-Dimensional Grids (HDG), which also introduces 1-D grids to\ncapture finer-grained information on distribution of each individual attribute\nand combines information from 1-D and 2-D grids to answer range queries. To\nmake HDG consistently effective, we provide a guideline for properly choosing\ngranularities of grids based on an analysis of how different sources of errors\nare impacted by these choices. Extensive experiments conducted on real and\nsynthetic datasets show that HDG can give a significant improvement over the\nexisting approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 2020 16:08:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-15"}

This algorithm involves a projection step of 3D joints to the 2D\nimage plane. The conventional approach is to follow weak perspective\nassumptions which use ad-hoc focal length. Through experimentation on the 3D\nPoses in the Wild (3DPW) dataset, we show that using full perspective\nprojection, with the correct camera center and an approximated focal length,\nprovides favorable results. Our algorithm has resulted in a winning entry for\nthe 3DPW Challenge, reaching first place in joints orientation accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 2020 16:23:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-15"}

Available communication\nresources (frequency-time blocks and transmit powers) and computational\nresources (processor usage) are allocated to stochastic arrivals of network\nslice requests. Each request arrives with priority (weight), throughput,\ncomputational resource, and latency (deadline) requirements, and if feasible,\nit is served with available communication and computational resources allocated\nover its requested duration. As each decision of resource allocation makes some\nof the resources temporarily unavailable for future, the myopic solution that\ncan optimize only the current resource allocation becomes ineffective for\nnetwork slicing. Therefore, a Q-learning solution is presented to maximize the\nnetwork utility in terms of the total weight of granted network slicing\nrequests over a time horizon subject to communication and computational\nconstraints.

Here, we address all these challenges using memristive gating of\nW/CoFeB/MgO/AlOx based SHNOs. In its high resistance state (HRS), the memristor\nmodulates the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) at the CoFeB/MgO\ninterface purely by the applied electric field.

The operation in both the HRS and LRS affects\nthe SHNO auto-oscillation mode and frequency, which can be tuned up to 28\nMHz/V. This tuning allows us to reversibly turn on/off mutual synchronization\nin chains of four SHNOs. We also demonstrate two individually controlled\nmemristors to tailor both the coupling strength and the frequency of the\nsynchronized state.

The\nlack of the mathematical understanding of the theory stands out in theoretical\nphysics. In order to address this problem we observe that a recently proposed\ngeneral model beyond the Standard Model resolves the energy scales of a lattice\nregularized Yang-Mills theory by means of an extra dimension. The extra\ndimension ensures that all intermediate length scales of the physical system\nare available by definition. In this paper we study the role of the extra\ndimension also in the case of the free boson field. We find that if the extra\ndimension size is large, the model describes the classical motion of the\nsystem. In the opposite limit we recover its standard quantum mechanical motion\nwithout loss of information. Therefore, the Hilbert space of states in the\npresence of the extra dimension describes physical phenomena at all energy\nscales. This observation allows us to raise the description of length scales by\nan extra dimension at the level of a principle for the theories beyond the\nStandard Model, the only modeling constraint being the correspondence\nprinciple. As it was shown recently, the fermion ground state energy of a gauge\ninvariant Hamilton operator of Dirac fermions gives a particular lattice\nregularization of the Yang-Mills theory. Integration of gauge fields gives a\npure fermion theory of color singlet fermion-antifermion pairs at each lattice\nsite evolving along the extra dimension. Color confinement follows directly\nfrom this property. It allows for a saddle point solution in the limit of a\nlarge number of colors. In this paper we find that the glueball spectrum of the\nYang-Mills regularized theory is of the Hagedron type and bounded below by a\npositive value. We show also that the color charge is screened and the\nquark-antiquark potential is constant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 2020 17:32:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-15"}

We\nfocus on the relation between the linear density galaxy bias $b_1$ and local\nPNG bias $b_\\phi$ in an idealized forecast setup with multitracer galaxy power\nspectrum and bispectrum data. We consider two parametrizations of galaxy bias:\n1) one inspired by the universality relation where $b_\\phi = 2\\delta_c\\left(b_1\n- p\\right)$ and $p$ is a free parameter; and 2) another in which the product of\nbias parameters and $f_{\\rm NL}$, like $f_{\\rm NL} b_\\phi$, is directly fitted\nfor. The constraints on the $f_{\\rm NL}-p$ plane are markedly bimodal, and both\nthe central value and width of marginalized constraints on $f_{\\rm NL}$ depend\nsensitively on the priors on $p$. Assuming fixed $p=1$ in the constraints with\na fiducial value of $p=0.55$ can bias the inferred $f_{\\rm NL}$ by $0.5\\sigma$\nto $1\\sigma$; priors $\\Delta p \\approx 0.5$ around this fiducial value are\nhowever sufficient in our setup to return unbiased constraints. In power\nspectrum analyses, parametrization 2, that makes no assumptions on $b_\\phi$,\ncan distinguish $f_{\\rm NL} \\neq 0$ with the same significance as\nparametrization 1 assuming perfect knowledge of $b_\\phi$ (the value of $f_{\\rm\nNL}$ is however left unknown). A drawback of parametrization 2 is that the\naddition of the bispectrum information is not as beneficial as in\nparametrization 1. Our results motivate strongly the incorporation of\nmitigation strategies for bias uncertainties in PNG constraint analyses, as\nwell as further theoretical studies on the relations between bias parameters to\nbetter inform those strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 2020 17:59:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-13"}

Instead, changes in $T_c$($x$) and\ntetragonal-to-orthorombic (nematic) transition $T_s$($x$) upon cooling are\ncorrelated with disorder in Fe vibrations in the direction orthogonal to Fe\nplanes, along the crystallographic c-axis.

However, the\nsuperbubble model appears more effective in destroying DM cusps than the\npreviously adopted \"blastwave\" model, reflecting a higher coupling efficiency\nof SN energy with the ISM. On larger scale, superbubble-driven outflows have a\nmore moderate impact: galaxies have higher gas content, more extended stellar\ndisks, and a smaller metal-enriched region in the CGM. The two halos with\n$M_{vir} \\sim 10^9$ $M_{\\odot}$, which formed ultra-faint dwarf galaxies in\nShen et al. (2014), remain dark due to the different impact of metal-enriched\ngalactic winds from two nearby luminous galaxies. The column density\ndistributions of H I, Si II, C IV and O VI are in agreement with recent\nobservations of CGM around isolated dwarfs. While H I is ubiquitous with a\ncovering fraction of unity within the CGM, Si II and C IV are less extended. O\nVI is more extended, but its mass is only 11% of the total CGM oxygen budget,\nas the diffuse CGM is highly ionised by the UVB. Superbubble feedback produces\nC IV and O VI an order of magnitude higher column densities than those with\nblastwave feedback. The CGM and DM cores are most sensitive probes of feedback\nmechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 2020 18:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-10"}

It\nwill be explained in detail how to improve the performance of this method using\na trained network, which is designed for the classification. The second method\ntakes as input a representative image of the search vehicle with similar\nmake/model, released year and colour. It is very useful when an image from the\nsearch vehicle is not available. It produces as output a shape and a colour\nfeatures. This could be used by the matching across a database to re-identify\nvehicles, which look similar to the search vehicle. To get a robust module for\nthe re-identification, a fine-grained classification has been trained, which\nits class consists of four elements: the make of a vehicle refers to the\nvehicle's manufacturer, e.g. Mercedes-Benz, the model of a vehicle refers to\ntype of model within that manufacturer's portfolio, e.g. C Class, the year\nrefers to the iteration of the model, which may receive progressive alterations\nand upgrades by its manufacturer and the perspective of the vehicle.

The SPA survey allows us to fully characterise the\nchemistry of nearby clusters. With a single set of spectra, we provide chemical\nabundances for some chemical elements, which are comparable to those obtained\nin two of the largest surveys combined. The metallicities and abundance ratios\nof our clusters fit very well in the radial distributions defined by the recent\nliterature, reinforcing the importance of star clusters to outline the spatial\ndistribution of abundances in our Galaxy.

In particular, we exhibit examples of codimension 2 contact\nembeddings into overtwisted and tight contact manifolds which are formally\nisotopic but fail to be isotopic through contact embeddings. We also give new\nobstructions to certain relative symplectic and Lagrangian cobordisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 2020 20:44:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Dec 2020 22:39:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 5 Jul 2022 01:58:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-06"}

Due to resource constraints, e.g., energy and communication bandwidth\nrequirements, these applications require compressing the recorded images before\ntransmission. For these applications, image compression commonly requires: (1)\nmaintaining features for coarse-grain pattern recognition instead of the\nhigh-level details for human perception due to machine-to-machine\ncommunications; (2) high compression ratio that leads to improved energy and\ntransmission efficiency; (3) large dynamic range of compression and an easy\ntrade-off between compression factor and quality of reconstruction to\naccommodate a wide diversity of IoT applications as well as their time-varying\nenergy/performance needs. To address these requirements, we propose, MAGIC, a\nnovel machine learning (ML) guided image compression framework that judiciously\nsacrifices visual quality to achieve much higher compression when compared to\ntraditional techniques, while maintaining accuracy for coarse-grained vision\ntasks. The central idea is to capture application-specific domain knowledge and\nefficiently utilize it in achieving high compression.

Inferring\nthe joint posterior probability distribution of moment tensor components and\nsource location is key for rigorous uncertainty quantification. However, the\ninference process requires forward modelling of microseismic traces for each\nset of parameters explored by the sampling algorithm, which makes the inference\nvery computationally intensive. In this paper we focus on accelerating this\nprocess by training deep learning models to learn the mapping between source\nlocation and seismic traces, for a given 3D heterogeneous velocity model, and a\nfixed isotropic moment tensor for the sources. These trained emulators replace\nthe expensive solution of the elastic wave equation in the inference process.\nWe compare our results with a previous study that used emulators based on\nGaussian Processes to invert microseismic events. We show that all of our\nmodels provide more accurate predictions and $\\sim 100$ times faster\npredictions than the method based on Gaussian Processes, and a\n$\\mathcal{O}(10^5)$ speed-up factor over a pseudo-spectral method for waveform\ngeneration.

We demonstrate that $\\beta$-VAE, with $\\beta < 1$, can not only\nattain good disentanglement but also significantly improve reconstruction\naccuracy via dynamic control. The paper removes the inherent trade-off between\nreconstruction accuracy and disentanglement for $\\beta$-VAE. Existing methods,\nsuch as $\\beta$-VAE and FactorVAE, assign a large weight to the KL-divergence\nterm in the objective function, leading to high reconstruction errors for the\nsake of better disentanglement. To mitigate this problem, a ControlVAE has\nrecently been developed that dynamically tunes the KL-divergence weight in an\nattempt to control the trade-off to more a favorable point. However, ControlVAE\nfails to eliminate the conflict between the need for a large $\\beta$ (for\ndisentanglement) and the need for a small $\\beta$. Instead, we propose\nDynamicVAE that maintains a different $\\beta$ at different stages of training,\nthereby decoupling disentanglement and reconstruction accuracy. In order to\nevolve the weight, $\\beta$, along a trajectory that enables such decoupling,\nDynamicVAE leverages a modified incremental PI (proportional-integral)\ncontroller, and employs a moving average as well as a hybrid annealing method\nto evolve the value of KL-divergence smoothly in a tightly controlled fashion.\nWe theoretically prove the stability of the proposed approach. Evaluation\nresults on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that DynamicVAE significantly\nimproves the reconstruction accuracy while achieving disentanglement comparable\nto the best of existing methods.

The resulting plan\nquality heavily depends on planners skills, experiences and devoted efforts,\nand varies significantly among cases, planners, and institutions. Quality\ncontrol for GK planning is desired to consistently provide high-quality plan to\neach patient. In this study, we proposed a quality control method for GK\nplanning by building a database of high-quality GK plans. Patient anatomy was\ndescribed by target volume, target shape complexity, and spatial relationship\nbetween target and nearby organs, which determine GK planning difficulty level.\nPlan quality was evaluated using target coverage, selectivity, intermediate\ndose spillage, maximum dose to 0.1 cc of brainstem, mean dose of ipsilateral\ncochlea, and beam-on time. When a new plan is created, a high-quality plan that\nhas the most similar target volume size and shape complexity will be identified\nfrom the database. A model has also been built to predict the dose to brainstem\nand cochlea based on their overlap volume histograms. The identified reference\nplan and the predicted organ dose will help planners to make quality control\ndecisions accordingly. To validate this method, we have built a database for\nvestibular schwannoma, which are considered to be challenging for GK planning\ndue to the irregularly-shaped target and its proximity to brainstem and\ncochlea. Five cases were tested, among which one case was considered to be of\nhigh quality and four cases had a lower plan quality than prediction. These\nfour cases were replanned and got substantially improved. Our results have\ndemonstrated the efficacy of our proposed quality control method. This method\nmay also be used as a plan quality prediction method to facilitate the\ndevelopment of automatic treatment planning for GK radiosurgery.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2020 01:38:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-16"}

Hence, GK plan quality may vary significantly among institutions\nand planners, and even for a same planner at different cases. This is\nparticularly a concern for challenging cases with complicated geometry, such as\nvestibular schwannoma cases. The purpose of this retrospective study is to\ninvestigate the plan quality and variation in the manually forward planned,\nclinically acceptable GK treatment plans of 22 previous vestibular schwannoma\ncases. Considering the impacts of different patient geometry and different\ntrade-offs among the planning objectives in GK planning, it is difficult to\nobjectively assess the plan quality across different cases. To reduce these\nconfounding factors on plan quality assessment, we employed our recently\ndeveloped multiresolution-level inverse planning algorithm to generate a golden\nplan for each case, which is expected to be on or close to the pareto surface\nwith a similar trade-off as used in the manual plan. The plan quality of the\nmanual plan is then quantified in terms of its deviation from the golden plan.\nA scoring criterion between 0-100 was designed to calculate a final score for\neach manual plan to simplify our analysis. Large quality variation was observed\nin these 22 cases, with two cases having a score lower than 75, three cases\nscoring between 80 and 85, two cases between 85 and 90, eight cases between 90\nand 95, and seven cases higher than 95.

Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can\neffectively reduce the completion time for the sensing tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2020 02:02:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-16"}

We propose a feature selection\nrepresentation matching (FSRM) method based on deep representation learning and\nmatching, which maps the original covariate space into a selective, nonlinear,\nand balanced representation space, and then conducts matching in the learned\nrepresentation space. FSRM adopts deep feature selection to minimize the\ninfluence of irrelevant variables for estimating treatment effects and\nincorporates a regularizer based on the Wasserstein distance to learn balanced\nrepresentations.

Methods: We\ncompare different methods of computation using data from PSP, STEREO A and\nWind. The effects of fluctuations and large scale structure on the estimate are\nprobed by using measured radial trends to produce synthetic data. Best\nestimates are computed as a function of time and space, and compared to\nestimates from PFSS models. Results: Radially-varying fluctuations of the HMF\nvector and variation of the Parker spiral angle cause the standard metrics of\nthe mean and mode to evolve with radius independent of the central value about\nwhich the vector fluctuates. This is best mitigated by projecting the vector\ninto the background Parker spiral direction. Nevertheless, we find a small\nenhancement in flux close to 1AU. The fraction of locally inverted field lines\ngrows with radial distance from the Sun which remains a possible physical\nreason for this excess, but is negligible at PSP`s perihelia. Similarly, the\nimpact of fluctuations in general is much reduced at PSP`s perihelia. The\noverall best estimate is ~2.5 nT AU2 . No strong dependence on latitude or\nlongitude is apparent. The PFSS models predict lower values from 1.2 to 1.8 nT\nAU2. Conclusions: The heliospheric flux is robustly estimated relative to a\nmean Parker spiral direction at PSP`s perihelia where the decay of fluctuations\nand weakening importance of local flux inversions means $\\Phi_H$ ~\n$\\Phi_{open}$. Despite this, the estimate remains too high to be explained by\nPFSS models, supporting the idea that coronal models underestimate the open\nmagnetic flux.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2020 02:56:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2020 20:31:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-02"}

The DL feature is a\nlow-dimensional representation of the high-dimensional seismic data, which is\nautomatically generated by a convolutional autoencoder (CAE) and preserved in\nthe latent space. The low-dimensional DL feature contains the key information\nof the input seismic data. Therefore, instead of directly comparing the\nwaveform differences between the observed and predicted data, such as\nfull-waveform inversion (FWI). We measure their DL feature differences in the\nlatent space of a CAE. The advantage of this low-dimensional comparison is that\nit is less prone to the cycle-skipping problem compared to FWI. The reason is\nthat the DL features mainly contain the kinematic information, such as\ntraveltime, of the input seismic data when the latent space dimension is small.\nHowever, more dynamic information, such as the waveform variations, can be\npreserved in the DL feature when the latent space dimension becomes larger.\nTherefore we propose a multiscale inversion approach that starts with inverting\nthe low-dimensional DL features for the low-wavenumber information of the\nsubsurface model. Then recover its high-wavenumber details through inverting\nthe high-dimensional DL features. However, there is no governing equation that\ncontains both the velocity and DL feature terms in the same equation. Therefore\nwe use the automatic differentiation (AD) to numerically connect the\nperturbation of DL features to the velocity perturbation. In another word, we\nconnect a deep learning network with the wave-equation inversion by using the\nAD. We denote this hybrid connection as hybrid machine learning (HML)\ninversion.

Here we re-evaluate the evidence\nof such an architecture that has been claimed for the KOI-89 system. KOI-89 is\nan early-type star with one validated transiting planet KOI-89.01/Kepler-462b\n(period 84.7 days, radius $3.0\\,R_\\oplus$) and one transiting planet candidate\nKOI-89.02 (period 207.6 days, radius $4.0\\,R_\\oplus$), where the latter\nexhibits transit timing variations (TTVs).

We perform a photodynamical modeling of the\nKepler transit light curves, and use the resulting constraints on the orbital\nconfiguration and transit times to update the gravity-darkened transit model.\nAs a result, we find no firm evidence for gravity darkening effect in the\ntransit shapes and conclude that stellar obliquity is not constrained by the\ndata. Given evidence for low orbital eccentricities from the dynamical\nanalysis, the system architecture can thus be consistent with many other\nmulti-transiting systems with flat, near-circular orbits aligned with the\nstellar spin.

AVD has posed great threat to both human listening and automatic\nspeaker verification (ASV). In this paper, we have found that ASV is not only a\nvictim of AVD but could be a tool to beat some simple types of AVD. Firstly,\nthree types of AVD, pitch scaling, vocal tract length normalization (VTLN) and\nvoice conversion (VC), are introduced as representative methods.\nState-of-the-art ASV methods are subsequently utilized to objectively evaluate\nthe impact of AVD on ASV by equal error rates (EER). Moreover, an approach to\nrestore disguised voice to its original version is proposed by minimizing a\nfunction of ASV scores w.r.t. restoration parameters. Experiments are then\nconducted on disguised voices from Voxceleb, a dataset recorded in real-world\nnoisy scenario. The results have shown that, for the voice disguise by pitch\nscaling, the proposed approach obtains an EER around 7% comparing to the 30%\nEER of a recently proposed baseline using the ratio of fundamental frequencies.\nThe proposed approach generalizes well to restore the disguise with nonlinear\nfrequency warping in VTLN by reducing its EER from 34.3% to 18.5%. However, it\nis difficult to restore the source speakers in VC by our approach, where more\ncomplex forms of restoration functions or other paralinguistic cues might be\nnecessary to restore the nonlinear transform in VC. Finally, contrastive\nvisualization on ASV features with and without restoration illustrate the role\nof the proposed approach in an intuitive way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2020 04:41:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-16"}

In this study, the mechanical characteristics of Cu-Ni\nFGM nanowires (NW) under uniaxial loading have been investigated using the\nproposed method through MD simulations. In order to describe the inter-atomic\nforces and hence predict the properties properly, EAM (Embedded atom model)\npotential has been used.

Simple Linear and Exponential functions have been considered as the\nfunctions which defines the grading pattern. The alloying percentage on the\nsurface has been varied from 0% to 50% for both Cu-cored and Ni-cored\nnanowires. All the simulations have been carried out at 300 K.

Our framework establishes a multi-aspect design to explain how\nthe learned knowledge from the existing model is transferred into the new\nlearning task when training deep neural networks. Based on a comprehensive\nrequirement and task analysis, we employ descriptive visualization with\nperformance measures and detailed inspections of model behaviors from the\nstatistical, instance, feature, and model structure levels. We demonstrate our\nframework through two case studies on image classification by fine-tuning\nAlexNets to illustrate how analysts can utilize our framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2020 05:59:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-16"}

This paper focuses on a popular scenario for CDR where\ndifferent domains share the same set of users but no overlapping items. The\nmajority of recent methods have explored the shared-user representation to\ntransfer knowledge across domains. However, the idea of shared-user\nrepresentation resorts to learn the overlapped features of user preferences and\nsuppresses the domain-specific features. Other works try to capture the\ndomain-specific features by an MLP mapping but require heuristic human\nknowledge of choosing samples to train the mapping. In this paper, we attempt\nto learn both features of user preferences in a more principled way. We assume\nthat each user's preferences in one domain can be expressed by the other one,\nand these preferences can be mutually converted to each other with the\nso-called equivalent transformation. Based on this assumption, we propose an\nequivalent transformation learner (ETL) which models the joint distribution of\nuser behaviors across domains. The equivalent transformation in ETL relaxes the\nidea of shared-user representation and allows the learned preferences in\ndifferent domains to preserve the domain-specific features as well as the\noverlapped features.

This study\nexamines how the economic effects of lockdowns in different regions interact\nthrough supply chains, a network of firms for production, simulating an\nagent-based model of production on supply-chain data for 1.6 million firms in\nJapan. We further investigate how the complex network structure affects the\ninteractions of lockdowns, emphasising the role of upstreamness and loops by\ndecomposing supply-chain flows into potential and circular flow components. We\nfind that a region's upstreamness, intensity of loops, and supplier\nsubstitutability in supply chains with other regions largely determine the\neconomic effect of the lockdown in the region. In particular, when a region\nlifts its lockdown, its economic recovery substantially varies depending on\nwhether it lifts lockdown alone or together with another region closely linked\nthrough supply chains. These results propose the need for inter-region policy\ncoordination to reduce the economic loss from lockdowns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2020 07:14:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 Jan 2021 09:02:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-15"}

However, most of current video networks require large\nmemory and computational resources, which hinders their applications in\npractice. Existing knowledge distillation methods are limited to the\nimage-level spatial domain, ignoring the temporal and frequency information\nwhich provide structural knowledge and are important for video analysis. This\npaper explores how to train small and efficient networks for action\nrecognition. Specifically, we propose two distillation strategies in the\nfrequency domain, namely the feature spectrum and parameter distribution\ndistillations respectively. Our insight is that appealing performance of action\nrecognition requires \\textit{explicitly} modeling the temporal frequency\nspectrum of video features. Therefore, we introduce a spectrum loss that\nenforces the student network to mimic the temporal frequency spectrum from the\nteacher network, instead of \\textit{implicitly} distilling features as many\nprevious works. Second, the parameter frequency distribution is further adopted\nto guide the student network to learn the appearance modeling process from the\nteacher. Besides, a collaborative learning strategy is presented to optimize\nthe training process from a probabilistic view.

According to many, 3DCP is set to revolutionize the construction\nindustry: yielding unparalleled aesthetics, better quality control, lower cost,\nand a reduction of the construction time. In this paper, two finite element\nmethod (FEM) strategies are presented for simulating such 3D concrete printing\nprocesses. The aim of these models is to predict the structural behaviour\nduring printing, while the concrete is still fresh, and estimate the optimal\nprint speed and maximum overhang angle to avoid print failures. Both FE\nanalyses involve solving multiple static implicit steps where sets of finite\nelements are added stepwise until failure. The main difference between the two\nmethods is in the discretization of the 3D model. The first method uses\nvoxelization to approximate the 3D shape, while the second approach starts from\ndefining the toolpath and constructs finite elements by sweeping them along the\npath. A case study is presented to evaluate the effectiveness of both\nstrategies. Both models are in good agreement with each other, and a comparable\nstructural response is obtained. The model's limitations and future challenges\nare also discussed. Ultimately, the paper demonstrates how FEM-based models can\neffectively simulate complex prints and could give recommendations with regards\nto a better print strategy. These suggestions can be related to the maximum\nprinting speed and overhang angle, but also the optimal layer height and\nthickness, the specific choice of the infill pattern, or by extension the\nmixture design. When print failures can be avoided, this methodology could save\ntime, resources and overall cost.

One widely used\nfinancial risk measure is Value-at-Risk (VaR). VaR estimates based on linear\nand parametric models can lead to biased results or even underestimation of\nrisk due to time varying volatility, skewness and leptokurtosis of financial\nreturn series. The paper proposes a nonlinear and nonparametric framework to\nforecast VaR that is motivated by overcoming the disadvantages of parametric\nmodels with a purely data driven approach. Mean and volatility are modeled via\nsupport vector regression (SVR) where the volatility model is motivated by the\nstandard generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH)\nformulation. Based on this, VaR is derived by applying kernel density\nestimation (KDE). This approach allows for flexible tail shapes of the profit\nand loss distribution, adapts for a wide class of tail events and is able to\ncapture complex structures regarding mean and volatility.\n  The SVR-GARCH-KDE hybrid is compared to standard, exponential and threshold\nGARCH models coupled with different error distributions. To examine the\nperformance in different markets, one-day-ahead and ten-days-ahead forecasts\nare produced for different financial indices.

Obviously, if the test image's\nquality factor does not match to the assumed value range, then degraded\nperformance will be resulted. With this motivation and further consideration of\npractical usage, a highly robust compression artifacts removal network is\nproposed in this paper.

On the other hand, the latter extracts the global\nfeatures of the entire image that provides highly instrumental image quality\nimprovement, especially effective on dealing with the global artifacts, such as\nblocking, color shifting.

A common challenge is to quantify uncertainties on model\ninputs (parameters) that correspond to a quantitative characterization of\nuncertainties on observable Quantities of Interest (QoI). To this end, we\nconsider a stochastic inverse problem (SIP) with a solution described by a\npullback probability measure.

A distinction is made between QoI\nuseful for solving the SIP and arbitrary model output data.

On the demand side,\nfrequency regulation services can be offered by buildings or districts that are\nequipped with electric heating or cooling systems, by exploiting their thermal\ninertia. Existing approaches for tapping into this potential typically rely on\ndynamic building models, which in practice can be challenging to obtain and\nmaintain. As a result, practical implementations of such systems are scarce.\nMoreover, actively controlling buildings requires extensive control\ninfrastructure and may cause privacy concerns in district energy systems.\nMotivated by this, we exploit the thermal inertia of buffer storage for\nreserves, reducing the building models to demand forecasts here. By combining a\ncontrol scheme based on Robust Model Predictive Control, with affine policies,\nand heating demand forecasting based on Artificial Neural Networks with online\ncorrection methods, we offer frequency regulation reserves and maintain user\ncomfort with a system comprising a heat pump and buffer storage. While the\nrobust approach ensures occupant comfort, the use of affine policies reduces\nthe effect of disturbance uncertainty on the system state. In a\nfirst-of-its-kind experiment with a real district-like building energy system,\nwe demonstrate that the scheme is able to offer reserves in a variety of\nconditions and track a regulation signal while meeting the heating demand of\nthe connected buildings. 13.4% of the consumed electricity is flexible.

At\nthe sunspot umbra, a periodicity of roughly 5 min is detected at the Doppler\nvelocity range of the CO 7-6 R67 line that formed in the photosphere, while a\nperiodicity of around 3 min is discovered at the Doppler velocities of CO 3-2\nR14 and Mg II k lines that formed in the upper photosphere or the temperature\nminimum region and the chromosphere. A time delay of about 2 min is measured\nbetween the strong CO 3-2 R14 line and the Mg II k line. Conclusions. Based on\nthe spectroscopic observations from the CYRA and IRIS, the 3 min sunspot\noscillation can be spatially resolved in the Doppler shifts. It may come from\nthe upper photosphere or the temperature minimum region and then propagate to\nthe chromosphere, which might be regarded as a propagating slow magnetoacoustic\nwave.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2020 09:21:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-28"}

The challenge is to encode the information about the graph\nstructure and the attributes associated with the nodes and edges into a low\ndimensional space. Most existing unsupervised methods promote similar\nrepresentations across nodes that are topologically close. Recently, it was\nshown that leveraging additional graph-level information, e.g., information\nthat is shared among all nodes, encourages the representations to be mindful of\nthe global properties of the graph, which greatly improves their quality.\nHowever, in most graphs, there is significantly more structure that can be\ncaptured, e.g., nodes tend to belong to (multiple) clusters that represent\nstructurally similar nodes. Motivated by this observation, we propose a graph\nrepresentation learning method called Graph InfoClust (GIC), that seeks to\nadditionally capture cluster-level information content. These clusters are\ncomputed by a differentiable K-means method and are jointly optimized by\nmaximizing the mutual information between nodes of the same clusters. This\noptimization leads the node representations to capture richer information and\nnodal interactions, which improves their quality.

This feature\nsuggests the dominance of small dust grains of size $a \\leq 0.1 \\mu m$ in the\nlocal environment of AGN, but the origin of such small grains is unclear. In\nthis paper, we aim to explain this observed feature by applying the RAdiative\nTorque Disruption (RATD) to model the extinction of AGN radiation from FUV to\nmid-infrared (MIR) wavelengths. We find that in the intense radiation field of\nAGN, large composite grains of size $a \\geq 0.1 \\mu m$ are significantly\ndisrupted to smaller sizes by RATD up to $d_{\\rm RATD} > 100$ pc in the polar\ndirection and $d_{\\rm RATD} \\sim 10$ pc in the torus region. Consequently,\noptical-MIR extinction decreases, whereas FUV-near-ultraviolet (NUV) extinction\nincreases, producing a steep far-UV rise extinction curve.

We further demonstrate our method's utility for ensemble\nasteroseismology by characterizing a sample of 30 Kepler subgiant stars, where\nwe find a majority of our age, mass, and radius estimates agree within\nuncertainties from more computationally expensive grid-based modelling\ntechniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2020 10:29:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2020 10:30:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-02"}

However, they are also known to be susceptible to backdoor\nattacks. When conducting backdoor attacks, most of the existing approaches\nassume that the targeted DNN is always available, and an attacker can always\ninject a specific pattern to the training data to further fine-tune the DNN\nmodel. However, in practice, such attack may not be feasible as the DNN model\nis encrypted and only available to the secure enclave.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel black-box backdoor attack technique on face\nrecognition systems, which can be conducted without the knowledge of the\ntargeted DNN model. To be specific, we propose a backdoor attack with a novel\ncolor stripe pattern trigger, which can be generated by modulating LED in a\nspecialized waveform. We also use an evolutionary computing strategy to\noptimize the waveform for backdoor attack. Our backdoor attack can be conducted\nin a very mild condition: 1) the adversary cannot manipulate the input in an\nunnatural way (e.g., injecting adversarial noise); 2) the adversary cannot\naccess the training database; 3) the adversary has no knowledge of the training\nmodel as well as the training set used by the victim party.\n  We show that the backdoor trigger can be quite effective, where the attack\nsuccess rate can be up to $88\\%$ based on our simulation study and up to $40\\%$\nbased on our physical-domain study by considering the task of face recognition\nand verification based on at most three-time attempts during authentication.\nFinally, we evaluate several state-of-the-art potential defenses towards\nbackdoor attacks, and find that our attack can still be effective. We highlight\nthat our study revealed a new physical backdoor attack, which calls for the\nattention of the security issue of the existing face recognition/verification\ntechniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2020 11:50:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-16"}

Despite\nover decade of research, the system's architecture remains not fully resolved.\nThe main difficulty comes from still narrow observing window of ~20 years that\ncovers small arcs of orbits with periods from roughly 50 to 500 years. Soon\nafter the discovery it became clear that unconstrained best-fitting astrometric\nconfigurations self-disrupt rapidly, due to strong mutual gravitational\ninteractions between ~10-Jupiter-mass companions. Recently, we showed that the\nHR 8799 system may be long term stable when locked in a generalized Laplace\n8:4:2:1 mean motion resonance (MMR) chain, and we constrained its orbits\nthrough the planetary migration. Here we qualitatively improve this approach by\nconsidering the MMR in terms of an exactly periodic configuration. This\nassumption enables us to construct for the first time the self-consistent\n$N$-body model of the long-term stable orbital architecture, using only\navailable astrometric positions of the planets relative to the star. We\nindependently determine planetary masses, which are consistent with\nthermodynamic evolution, and the parallax overlapping to $1\\sigma$ with the\nmost recent GAIA DR2 value.

First,\nwe present a stochastic differential equation that describes fluctuations in\nthe mass growth of DM halos, as driven by a multiplicative white (Gaussian)\nnoise dependent on the spherical collapse threshold and on the power spectrum\nof DM perturbations. We demonstrate that such a noise yields an average drift\nof the halo population toward larger masses, that quantitatively renders the\nstandard hierarchical clustering. Then, we solve the Fokker-Planck equation\nassociated to the stochastic dynamics, and obtain the Press & Schechter mass\nfunction as a (stationary) solution. Moreover, generalizing our treatment to a\nmass-dependent collapse threshold, we obtain an exact analytic solution capable\nof fitting remarkably well the N-body mass function over a wide range in mass\nand redshift.

Contrary to the classical energy\ncondition which are known to be violated in QFT, QNEC is a consequence of the\nquantum focussing conjecture and has been proven for several special cases and\nin general for QFTs in three or more spacetime dimensions. QNEC involves an\nintrinsically quantum property of the theory under consideration, the\nentanglement entropy (EE). While EE is notoriously hard to calculate in QFT,\nthe holographic principle provides a simple geometric description. In general\nthe holographic principle relates a gauge theory without gravity to a theory of\nquantum gravity in one dimension higher. Holography provides a way to learn\nabout strongly coupled field theories as well as quantum gravity and\ninvestigating QNEC in this context will undoubtedly lead to new insights. In\nthis thesis the focus is put on $2$- and $4$-dimensional field theories, where\nwe study systems of increasing complexity with numerical and analytical\nmethods. In vacuum, thermal states, globally quenched states and a toy model\nfor heavy ion collisions we find that QNEC is always satisfied and sometimes\nsaturated, while it can be a stronger or weaker condition than the classical\nnull energy condition. Interestingly in two dimensions QNEC$_2$ cannot be\nsaturated in the presence of bulk matter. The backreaction of a massive scalar\nparticle provides an example where the finite gap to saturation is precisely\nknown. Considering a massive self-interacting scalar field coupled to Einstein\ngravity leads to phase transitions from small to large black holes. The dual\nfield theory provides a rich example to use QNEC$_2$ as a tool to learn about\nstrongly coupled dynamical systems. In particular knowing QNEC$_2$ in the\nground state allows us to make statements about the phase structure of the\nthermal states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2020 12:55:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-16"}

We have collected and analyzed PIONIER\nH-band data from the Very Large Telescope Interferometer, TESS visible\nphotometric data, and X-ray observations with Chandra of HD94660. Using\nPIONIER, we were able to detect the companion to HD94660, which is absent from\nhigh quality spectra at visible wavelengths, with a magnitude difference of 1.8\nin the H band at a separation of 18.72mas. The TESS light curve shows\nvariations with a period of 2.1d and also flaring. The Chandra spectrum is well\ndescribed by emission from hot thermal plasma, yet might include a non-thermal\ncomponent. The X-ray properties are compatible with a magnetically active\ncompanion, while some magnetospheric contribution from the primary is also\npossible. We can rule out that the companion to HD94660 is a compact source. It\nis also very unlikely that this companion is a single star, as the estimated\nmass of more than 2M_sun, the magnitude difference of 1.8 in the H band, and\nits non-detection in visible spectra are difficult to realize in a single\nobject. One alternative could be a pair of late F stars, which would also be\nresponsible for the detected photometric variations. Interferometric\nobservations over the full binary orbit are necessary to determine the real\nmass of the companion and to add constraints on the overall geometry of the\nsystem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2020 13:12:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-21"}

Unfortunately, these taxonomies\nfail when applied to communicative visualizations. Instead, designers often\nresort to evaluating communicative visualizations from the cognitive efficiency\nperspective: \"can the recipient accurately decode my message/insight?\" However,\ndesigners are unlikely to be satisfied if the message went 'in one ear and out\nthe other.' The consequence of this inconsistency is that it is difficult to\ndesign or select between competing options in a principled way. The problem we\naddress is the fundamental mismatch between how designers want to describe\ntheir intent, and the language they have. We argue that visualization designers\ncan address this limitation through a learning lens: that the recipient is a\nstudent and the designer a teacher. By using learning objectives, designers can\nbetter define, assess, and compare communicative visualizations. We illustrate\nhow the learning-based approach provides a framework for understanding a wide\narray of communicative goals. To understand how the framework can be applied\n(and its limitations), we surveyed and interviewed members of the Data\nVisualization Society using their own visualizations as a probe.

Existing second-order methods\nresort to various diagonal or low-rank approximations of the Hessian, which\noften fail to capture necessary curvature information to generate a substantial\nimprovement. On the other hand, when training becomes batch-based (i.e.,\nstochastic), noisy second-order information easily contaminates the training\nprocedure unless expensive safeguard is employed. In this paper, we adopt a\nnumerical algorithm for second-order neural network training. We tackle the\npractical obstacle of Hessian calculation by using the complex-step finite\ndifference (CSFD) -- a numerical procedure adding an imaginary perturbation to\nthe function for derivative computation. CSFD is highly robust, efficient, and\naccurate (as accurate as the analytic result). This method allows us to\nliterally apply any known second-order optimization methods for deep learning\ntraining. Based on it, we design an effective Newton Krylov procedure. The key\nmechanism is to terminate the stochastic Krylov iteration as soon as a\ndisturbing direction is found so that unnecessary computation can be avoided.\nDuring the optimization, we monitor the approximation error in the Taylor\nexpansion to adjust the step size. This strategy combines advantages of line\nsearch and trust region methods making our method preserves good local and\nglobal convergency at the same time. We have tested our methods in various deep\nlearning tasks. The experiments show that our method outperforms exiting\nmethods, and it often converges one-order faster.

This calculation hinges on the existence of an $L_\\infty$\naction of the supersymmetry algebra on the abelian tensor multiplet, which we\ndescribe in detail. Our formulation appears naturally in the pure spinor\nsuperfield formalism, but understanding it requires developing a presymplectic\ngeneralization of the BV formalism, inspired by Dirac's theory of constraints.\nThe holomorphic twist consists of symplectic-valued holomorphic bosons from the\n$\\mathcal{N}=(1,0)$ hypermultiplet, together with a degenerate holomorphic\ntheory of holomorphic coclosed one-forms from the $\\mathcal{N}=(1,0)$ tensor\nmultiplet, which can be interpreted as representing the intermediate Jacobian.\nWe check that our formulation and our results match with known ones under\nvarious dimensional reductions, as well as comparing the holomorphic twist to\nKodaira-Spencer theory. Matching our formalism to five-dimensional Yang-Mills\ntheory after reduction leads to some issues related to electric-magnetic\nduality; we offer some speculation on a nonperturbative resolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2020 14:16:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Jan 2022 18:24:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-10"}

For this, we used a labeling scheme from a pre-existing vector\nquantization technique in conjunction with different machine learning\nalgorithms to categorize spectra of singly-ionized magnesium Mg II measured by\nNASA's Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph satellite (IRIS) into five types\nof solar activity. Our training dataset is a human annotated list of 85 IRIS\nobservations containing 29097 frames. The annotated types of Solar activities\nare active region, pre-flare activity, Solar flare, Sunspot, and quiet Sun. We\ncompress these data and reduce its complexity before training classifiers. We\nfound that the XGBoost classifier produces the most accurate results on the\ncompressed data, yielding over a 95\\% prediction rate, and outperforming other\nML methods like convolution neural networks, K-nearest neighbors, naive Bayes\nclassifiers, and SVM. We find that the classification performance on compressed\nand uncompressed data is comparable, implying the possibility of large\ncompression rates for relatively low degrees of information loss.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2020 15:07:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Jun 2021 10:18:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-23"}

While this assumption is satisfied for classical\nmachines in many scenarios, it is not expected to be satisfied in the near term\nfuture for quantum machines where decoherence leads to faults in the quantum\ngates. As a result, fundamental questions regarding the practical relevance of\nquantum channel coding remain open. By combining techniques from fault-tolerant\nquantum computation with techniques from quantum communication, we initiate the\nstudy of these questions. We introduce fault-tolerant versions of quantum\ncapacities quantifying the optimal communication rates achievable with\nasymptotically vanishing total error when the encoding and decoding circuits\nare affected by gate errors with small probability.

Methods: A\nself-decoupled 32-channel receive array for human brain imaging at 10.5T\n(10.5T-32Rx), consisting of 31 loops and one cloverleaf element, was\nco-designed and built in tandem with a 16-channel dual-row loop transmitter.\nNovel receive array design and self-decoupling techniques were implemented.\nParallel imaging performance, in terms of SNR and noise amplification\n(g-factor), of the 10.5T-32Rx was compared to the performance of an\nindustry-standard 32-channel receiver at 7T (7T-32Rx) via experimental phantom\nmeasurements.

The main issue of such methods is that their\ncomplexity does not scale favorably with the problem size, limiting previous\nstudies to cell-free massive MIMO of moderate scales. Thus the potential of\ncell-free massive MIMO has not been fully understood. To address this issue, we\npropose a unified framework based on an accelerated projected gradient method\nto solve the considered problems.

Applying deep learning on graphs has recently showed good performance\nin many applications in social analysis, bioinformatics etc. A message passing\ngraph convolution network is such a powerful method which has expressive power\nto learn graph structures. Meanwhile, circRNA is a type of non-coding RNA which\nplays a critical role in human diseases. Identifying the associations between\ncircRNAs and diseases is important to diagnosis and treatment of complex\ndiseases. However, there are limited number of known associations between them\nand conducting biological experiments to identify new associations is time\nconsuming and expensive. As a result, there is a need of building efficient and\nfeasible computation methods to predict potential circRNA-disease associations.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel graph convolution network framework to learn\nfeatures from a graph built with multi-source similarity information to predict\ncircRNA-disease associations.

The growing popularity of edge\ncomputing makes us look for ways to reduce its time for mobile and embedded\ndevices. One way to decrease the neural network inference time is to modify a\nneuron model to make it moreefficient for computations on a specific device.\nThe example ofsuch a model is a bipolar morphological neuron model. The bipolar\nmorphological neuron is based on the idea of replacing multiplication with\naddition and maximum operations. This model has been demonstrated for simple\nimage classification with LeNet-like architectures [1]. In the paper, we\nintroduce a bipolar morphological ResNet (BM-ResNet) model obtained from a much\nmore complex ResNet architecture by converting its layers to bipolar\nmorphological ones. We apply BM-ResNet to image classification on MNIST and\nCIFAR-10 datasets with only a moderate accuracy decrease from 99.3% to 99.1%\nand from 85.3% to 85.1%. We also estimate the computational complexity of the\nresulting model. We show that for the majority of ResNet layers, the considered\nmodel requires 2.1-2.9 times fewer logic gates for implementation and 15-30%\nlower latency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2020 15:54:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 2020 16:28:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-22"}

SWITCH features a highly efficient and effective utilization of the\ngradient of a surrogate model $\\hat{\\mathbf{g}}$ w.r.t. the input image, i.e.,\nthe transferable gradient. In each iteration, SWITCH first tries to update the\ncurrent sample along the direction of $\\hat{\\mathbf{g}}$, but considers\nswitching to its opposite direction $-\\hat{\\mathbf{g}}$ if our algorithm\ndetects that it does not increase the value of the attack objective function.\nWe justify the choice of switching to the opposite direction by a local\napproximate linearity assumption. In SWITCH, only one or two queries are needed\nper iteration, but it is still effective due to the rich information provided\nby the transferable gradient, thereby resulting in unprecedented query\nefficiency. To improve the robustness of SWITCH, we further propose\nSWITCH$_\\text{RGF}$ in which the update follows the direction of a random\ngradient-free (RGF) estimate when neither $\\hat{\\mathbf{g}}$ nor its opposite\ndirection can increase the objective, while maintaining the advantage of SWITCH\nin terms of query efficiency. Experimental results conducted on CIFAR-10,\nCIFAR-100 and TinyImageNet show that compared with other methods, SWITCH\nachieves a satisfactory attack success rate using much fewer queries, and\nSWITCH$_\\text{RGF}$ achieves the state-of-the-art attack success rate with\nfewer queries overall. Our approach can serve as a strong baseline for future\nblack-box attacks because of its simplicity.

A growing planet embedded in a protoplanetary disk induces\nthree-dimensional (3D) gas flow. In our previous study, Paper I, we focused on\nthe shear regime of pebble accretion, and investigated the influence of\nplanet-induced gas flow on pebble accretion. In Paper I, we found that pebble\naccretion is inefficient in the planet-induced gas flow compared to that in the\nunperturbed flow, in particular when ${\\rm St}\\lesssim10^{-3}$, where St is the\nStokes number. Following Paper I, we investigate the influence of\nplanet-induced gas flow on pebble accretion. We consider the headwind of the\ngas, which is not included in Paper I. We extend our study to the headwind\nregime of pebble accretion in this study. Assuming a nonisothermal, inviscid\nsub-Keplerian gas disk, we perform 3D hydrodynamical simulations on the\nspherical polar grid which has a planet with the dimensionless mass, $m=R_{\\rm\nBondi}/H$, located at its center, where $R_{\\rm Bondi}$ and $H$ are the Bondi\nradius and the disk scale height. We then numerically integrate the equation of\nmotion of pebbles in 3D using hydrodynamical simulation data. Combining our\nresults with the spacial variety of turbulence strength and pebble size in a\ndisk, we conclude that the planet-induced gas flow still allows for pebble\naccretion in the early stage of planet formation. Suppression of pebble\naccretion due to the planet-induced gas flow occurs only in the late stage of\nplanet formation, in particular in the inner region of the disk. This may be\nhelpful to explain the distribution of exoplanets and the architecture of the\nSolar System, both of which have small inner and large outer planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2020 02:15:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-28"}

Nonetheless, how exactly active\nobservation occurs in humans so that it can inform the design of active\ncomputer vision systems is an open problem. PESAO is designed for investigating\nactive, visual observation in a 3D world. The goal was to build an experimental\nsetup for various active perception tasks with human subjects (active\nobservers) in mind that is capable of tracking the head and gaze. While many\nstudies explore human performances, usually, they use line drawings portrayed\nin 2D, and no active observer is involved. PESAO allows us to bring many\nstudies to the three-dimensional world, even involving active observers. In our\ninstantiation, it spans an area of 400cm x 300cm and can track active observers\nat a frequency of 120Hz. Furthermore, PESAO provides tracking and recording of\n6D head motion, gaze, eye movement-type, first-person video, head-mounted IMU\nsensor, birds-eye video, and experimenter notes. All are synchronized at\nmicrosecond resolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2020 15:06:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Sep 2020 17:12:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-01"}

We analyze the generation of a\ncertain damping-induced unpredictability, due to the gradual suppression of\ninterwell oscillations. We find the minimal amount of the forcing amplitude and\nthe right forcing frequency to revert the effect of the dissipation, so that\nthe interwell oscillations can be restored, for different time delay values.\nThis is achieved by using the delay-induced resonance, in which the time delay\nreplaces one of the two periodic forcings present in the vibrational resonance.\nA discussion in terms of the time delay of the critical values of the forcing\nfor which the delay-induced resonance can tame the dissipation effect is\nfinally carried out.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2020 08:44:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-17"}

Moreover, when subject to\nphysico-chemical stimuli their collective behaviour often drives large scale\ninstabilities of hydrodynamic nature, with implications for biomixing in\nnatural environments and incipient industrial applications. In turn, our\nability for external control of these driving stimuli could be used to govern\nthe emerging patterns.
