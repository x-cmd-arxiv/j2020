In\nthis scenario, we show that the speed of light and an invariant minimum speed\npresent an explicit dependence on the background temperature of the expanding\nuniverse. Although finding the speed of light in the early universe with very\nhigh temperature and also in the very old one with very low temperature, being\nrespectively much larger and much smaller than its current value, our approach\ndoes not violate the postulate of Special Relativity (SR), which claims the\nspeed of light is invariant in a kinematics point of view.

As this substitution\ntakes place outside the conducting Fe planes, the electronic behaviour is less\naffected by the impurity scattering experimentally and relevant key electronic\nparameters can be accessed. In this short review, I present the experimental\nprogress made in understanding the electronic behaviour of the nematic\nelectronic superconductors, FeSe1-xSx. A direct signature of the nematic\nelectronic state is in-plane anisotropic distortion of the Fermi surface\ntriggered by orbital ordering effects and electronic interactions that result\nin multi-band shifts detected by ARPES. Upon sulphur substitution, the\nelectronic correlations and the Fermi velocities decrease in the tetragonal\nphase. Quantum oscillations are observed for the whole series in ultra-high\nmagnetic fields and show a complex spectra due to the presence of many small\norbits. Effective masses associated to the largest orbit display non-divergent\nbehaviour at the nematic end point (x~0.175(5)), as opposed to critical\nspin-fluctuations in other iron pnictides. Magnetotransport behaviour has a\nstrong deviation from the Fermi liquid behaviour and linear T resistivity is\ndetected at low temperatures inside the nematic phase, where scattering from\nlow energy spin-fluctuations are likely to be present. The superconductivity is\nnot enhanced in FeSe1-xSx and there are no divergent electronic correlations at\nthe nematic end point. These manifestations indicate a strong coupling with the\nlattice in FeSe1-xSx and a pairing mechanism likely promoted by spin\nfluctuations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Sep 2020 16:55:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-25"}

In these\nworks the RL agent directly observes the natural state of the game and controls\nthat state directly with its actions. However, when humans play such games,\nthey do not just reason about the moves but also interact with their physical\nenvironment. They understand the state of the game by looking at the physical\nboard in front of them and modify it by manipulating pieces using touch and\nfine-grained motor control. Mastering complicated physical systems with\nabstract goals is a central challenge for artificial intelligence, but it\nremains out of reach for existing RL algorithms. To encourage progress towards\nthis goal we introduce a set of physically embedded planning problems and make\nthem publicly available. We embed challenging symbolic tasks (Sokoban,\ntic-tac-toe, and Go) in a physics engine to produce a set of tasks that require\nperception, reasoning, and motor control over long time horizons. Although\nexisting RL algorithms can tackle the symbolic versions of these tasks, we find\nthat they struggle to master even the simplest of their physically embedded\ncounterparts. As a first step towards characterizing the space of solution to\nthese tasks, we introduce a strong baseline that uses a pre-trained expert game\nplayer to provide hints in the abstract space to an RL agent's policy while\ntraining it on the full sensorimotor control task. The resulting agent solves\nmany of the tasks, underlining the need for methods that bridge the gap between\nabstract planning and embodied control.

In the problem, the input is a graph $G$ with constant degree and a\nset of values for every vertex of $G$. The goal is to preprocess $G$ such that\nwhen given a query value $q$, and a connected subgraph $\\pi$ of $G$, we can\nfind the predecessor of $q$ in all the sets associated with the vertices of\n$\\pi$. The fundamental result of fractional cascading is that there exists a\ndata structure that uses linear space and it can answer queries in $O(\\log n +\n|\\pi|)$ time [Chazelle and Guibas, 1986]. While this technique has received\nplenty of attention in the past decades, an almost quadratic space lower bound\nfor \"2D fractional cascading\" [Chazelle and Liu, 2001] has convinced the\nresearchers that fractional cascading is fundamentally a 1D technique.\n  In 2D fractional cascading, the input includes a planar subdivision for every\nvertex of $G$ and the query is a point $q$ and a subgraph $\\pi$ and the goal is\nto locate the cell containing $q$ in all the subdivisions associated with the\nvertices of $\\pi$. In this paper, we show that it is possible to circumvent the\nlower bound of Chazelle and Liu for axis-aligned planar subdivisions. We\npresent a number of upper and lower bounds which reveal that in 2D, the problem\nhas a much richer structure. When $G$ is a tree and $\\pi$ is a path, then\nqueries can be answered in\n$O(\\log{n}+|\\pi|+\\min\\{|\\pi|\\sqrt{\\log{n}},\\alpha(n)\\sqrt{|\\pi|}\\log{n}\\})$\ntime using linear space where $\\alpha$ is an inverse Ackermann function;\nsurprisingly, we show both branches of this bound are tight, up to the inverse\nAckermann factor. When $G$ is a general graph or when $\\pi$ is a general\nsubgraph, then the query bound becomes $O(\\log n + |\\pi|\\sqrt{\\log n})$ and\nthis bound is once again tight in both cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Sep 2020 17:25:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Nov 2020 10:34:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-30"}

This\nlevel of performance will fuel numerous real-time applications, such as\nautonomy and augmented reality, where the computationally heavy tasks can be\nperformed in the cloud. The increase in the bandwidth along with the use of\ndense constellations places a significant burden on the speed and accuracy of\nanalog-to-digital converters (ADC). A popular approach to create wideband ADCs\nis utilizing multiple channels each operating at a lower speed in the\ntime-interleaved fashion. However, an interleaved ADC comes with its own set of\nchallenges. The parallel architecture is very sensitive to the inter-channel\nmismatch, timing jitter, clock skew between different ADC channels as well as\nthe nonlinearity within individual channels. Consequently, complex\npost-calibration is required using digital signal processing (DSP) after the\nADC.

However, efficiently removing\nthis data from an ML model is generally difficult. In this paper, we introduce\ndata removal-enabled (DaRE) forests, a variant of random forests that enables\nthe removal of training data with minimal retraining. Model updates for each\nDaRE tree in the forest are exact, meaning that removing instances from a DaRE\nmodel yields exactly the same model as retraining from scratch on updated data.\n  DaRE trees use randomness and caching to make data deletion efficient. The\nupper levels of DaRE trees use random nodes, which choose split attributes and\nthresholds uniformly at random. These nodes rarely require updates because they\nonly minimally depend on the data. At the lower levels, splits are chosen to\ngreedily optimize a split criterion such as Gini index or mutual information.\nDaRE trees cache statistics at each node and training data at each leaf, so\nthat only the necessary subtrees are updated as data is removed. For numerical\nattributes, greedy nodes optimize over a random subset of thresholds, so that\nthey can maintain statistics while approximating the optimal threshold. By\nadjusting the number of thresholds considered for greedy nodes, and the number\nof random nodes, DaRE trees can trade off between more accurate predictions and\nmore efficient updates.\n  In experiments on 13 real-world datasets and one synthetic dataset, we find\nDaRE forests delete data orders of magnitude faster than retraining from\nscratch while sacrificing little to no predictive power.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Sep 2020 17:53:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Jun 2021 22:04:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-15"}

To obtain long-term stability the symplectic\nproperty is enforced via the choice of the matrix-valued covariance function.\nBased on earlier work on spline interpolation we observe derivatives of the\ngenerating function of a canonical transformation. A product kernel produces an\naccurate implicit method, whereas a sum kernel results in a fast explicit\nmethod from this approach. Both correspond to a symplectic Euler method in\nterms of numerical integration. These methods are applied to the pendulum and\nthe H\\'enon-Heiles system and results compared to an symmetric regression with\northogonal polynomials. In the limit of small mapping times, the Hamiltonian\nfunction can be identified with a part of the generating function and thereby\nlearned from observed time-series data of the system's evolution. Besides\ncomparable performance of implicit kernel and spectral regression for\nsymplectic maps, we demonstrate a substantial increase in performance for\nlearning the Hamiltonian function compared to existing approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Sep 2020 17:56:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-02"}

Computer\nsimulations of coiling and its effect on aneurysmal flow could help clinicians\npredict treatment outcomes a priori, but it requires accurate modeling of coils\nand their deployment procedure. In addition to being accurate, coiling\nsimulations must be efficient to be used as a bedside tool. To date, several\nvirtual coiling techniques have been developed, but they lack either accuracy\nor efficiency. For example, finite-element-based virtual coiling methods model\nthe mechanics of coiling and are highly accurate, at the expense of high\ncomputational cost (and thus low efficiency). Geometric-rule-based coiling\ntechniques ignore the mechanics and therefore are computationally efficient,\nbut may produce unrealistic coil deployments.

The\nSWEAP instrument, in conjunction with the quasi-thermal noise measurement form\nFields, provides the electron heat flux, beta, and other electron parameters.\n  RESULTS: Parker Solar Probe observations inside ~0.3 AU show that the waves\nare more intermittent than at 1 AU, and are often interspersed with\nelectrostatic whistler/Bernstein waves at higher frequencies. This is likely\ndue to the more variable solar wind observed closer to the Sun. The whistlers\nusually occur within regions when the magnetic field is more variable and often\nwith small increases in the solar wind speed.

The\nassociation with heat flux and beta is generally consistent with the whistler\nfan instability although there are intervals where the heat flux is\nsignificantly lower than the instability limit.

A recent web API model is GraphQL, which\nis both a query language and a runtime. Using GraphQL, client queries express\nthe data they want to retrieve or mutate, and servers respond with exactly\nthose data or changes. GraphQL's expressiveness is risky for service providers\nbecause clients can succinctly request stupendous amounts of data, and\nresponding to overly complex queries can be costly or disrupt service\navailability. Recent empirical work has shown that many service providers are\nat risk. Using traditional API management methods is not sufficient, and\npractitioners lack principled means of estimating and measuring the cost of the\nGraphQL queries they receive. In this work, we present a linear-time GraphQL\nquery analysis that can measure the cost of a query without executing it. Our\napproach can be applied in a separate API management layer and used with\narbitrary GraphQL backends. In contrast to existing static approaches, our\nanalysis supports common GraphQL conventions that affect query cost, and our\nanalysis is provably correct based on our formal specification of GraphQL\nsemantics. We demonstrate the potential of our approach using a novel GraphQL\nquery-response corpus for two commercial GraphQL APIs.

In contrast, existing\nstatic GraphQL query analyses exhibit over-estimates and under-estimates\nbecause they fail to support GraphQL conventions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Sep 2020 19:33:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-15"}

In contrast to other\nstrategy game frameworks, Stratega allows to create a wide variety of\nturn-based and real-time strategy games using a common API for agent\ndevelopment. While the current version supports the development of turn-based\nstrategy games and agents, we will add support for real-time strategy games in\nfuture updates. Flexibility is achieved by utilising YAML-files to configure\ntiles, units, actions, and levels. Therefore, the user can design and run a\nvariety of games to test developed agents without specifically adjusting it to\nthe game being generated. The framework has been built with a focus of\nstatistical forward planning (SFP) agents. For this purpose, agents can access\nand modify game-states and use the forward model to simulate the outcome of\ntheir actions. While SFP agents have shown great flexibility in general\ngame-playing, their performance is limited in case of complex state and\naction-spaces.

Recently, the fast\nmask-based learning method (e.g. piggyback \\cite{mallya2018piggyback}) is\nproposed to address these issues by learning only a binary element-wise mask in\na fast manner, while keeping the backbone model fixed. However, the binary mask\nhas limited modeling capacity for new tasks.

Such research\ndirection recently draws great attention, where one realization is to train the\ntarget DNN through a multiple-term objective function, which consists of\ncross-entropy terms from multiple sub-nets.

However,\nwhen users are mobile, such containers need to be migrated to other edge\nservers located closer to the MUs to keep the E2E delay low. Meanwhile, the\nmobility of MUs necessitates handover among base stations in order to keep the\nwireless connections between MUs and base stations uninterrupted. In this\npaper, we address the joint problem of container migration and base-station\nhandover by proposing a coordinated migration-handover mechanism, with the\nobjective of achieving low E2E delay and minimizing service interruption. The\nmechanism determines the optimal destinations and time for migration and\nhandover in a coordinated manner, along with a delta checkpoint technique that\nwe propose.

Another line of work has focused on developing generative\nmodels which lead to higher quality samples but currently lack any formal\nprivacy guarantees.

Due to the difficulty of measuring\nimportant emission lines, the number of objects for the abundance gradient is\nsmall, but there is a hint that this galaxy has a broken gradient profile, with\na drop towards the center.

We\ncompared different fitting methods by using spectra (or by combining\nphotometry) to determine the physical parameters. We choose a sample of 17 star\nclusters in M33, which previously lacked spectroscopic observations. The\nlow-resolution spectra were taken with the Xinglong 2.16-m reflector of NAOC.\nThe photometry used in the fitting includes $\\rm u_{SC}$ and $\\rm v_{SAGE}$\nbands from the SAGE survey, as well as the published $UBVRI$ and $ugriz$\nphotometry. We firstly derived ages and metallicities with the {\\sc ULySS}\n(Vazdekis et al. and {\\sc pegase-hr}) SSP model and the Bruzual \\& Charlot\n(2003) (BC03) stellar population synthesis models for the full-spectrum\nfitting. The fitting results of both the BC03 and {\\sc ULySS} models seem\nconsistent with those of previous works as well. Then we add the SAGE $\\rm\nu_{SC}$ and $\\rm v_{SAGE}$ photometry in the spectroscopic fitting with the\nBC03 models. It seems the results become much better, especially for the Padova\n2000+Chabrier IMF set. Finally we add more photometry data, $UBVRI$ and\n$ugriz$, in the fitting and we found that the results do not improve\nsignificantly. Therefore, we conclude that the photometry is useful for\nimproving the fitting results, especially for the blue bands ($\\lambda <4000$\n{\\AA}), e.g., $\\rm u_{SC}$ and $\\rm v_{SAGE}$ band. At last, we discuss the\n\"UV-excess\" for the star clusters and we find five star clusters have\nUV-excess, based on the $GALEX$ FUV, NUV photometry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Sep 2020 03:15:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-18"}

The well-known interval\nbudgeted uncertainty representation is assumed. Two of its variants are\nconsidered. The first one is the discrete budgeted uncertainty, in which at\nmost a specified number of cumulative demands can deviate from their nominal\nvalues at the same time.The second variant is the continuous budgeted\nuncertainty, in which the sum of the deviations of cumulative demands from\ntheir nominal values, at the same time, is at most a bound on the total\ndeviation provided. For both cases, in order to choose a production plan that\nhedges against the cumulative demand uncertainty, the robust minmax criterion\nis used. Polynomial algorithms for evaluating the impact of uncertainty in the\ndemand on a given production plan in terms of its cost, called the adversarial\nproblem, and for finding robust production plans under the discrete budgeted\nuncertainty are constructed. Hence, in this case, the problems under\nconsideration are not much computationally harder than their deterministic\ncounterparts. For the continuous budgeted uncertainty, it is shown that the\nadversarial problem and the problem of computing a robust production plan along\nwith its worst-case cost are NP-hard. In the case, when uncertainty intervals\nare non-overlapping, they can be solved in pseudopolynomial time and admit\nfully polynomial timeapproximation schemes.

This paper intends to quantify the importance of syntactic\ninformation for neural SRL in the deep learning framework.

Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) represent an effective approach\nfor integrating the two complementary factors of node attributes and structural\ninformation for attributed graph clustering. However, oversmoothing of GCNs\nproduces indistinguishable representations of nodes, such that the nodes in a\ngraph tend to be grouped into fewer clusters, and poses a challenge due to the\nresulting performance drop.

Our results suggest that the\ntopological phases are protected by the real gaps and the bulk-edge\ncorrespondence readily seen in the real edge-state spectra.

If the triplet excitons generated by SF can\nbe transferred to inorganic quantum dots (QDs), where they radiatively\nrecombine, SF based photon multiplication is achieved, converting a single\nhigh-energy photon into two low-energy photons. Such a SF photon multiplication\nfilm (SF-PMF) could raise the efficiency of the best Si-PV from 26.7% to 32.5%.\nBut a precise nanoscale morphology is required within such a film consisting of\nthe appropriate morphology for the organic phase, allowing for efficient SF,\nwithin which the QD emitters are well dispersed on a tens of nm length scale to\nenable efficient harvesting of the triplets. However, it has been a\nlong-standing problem that the individual components in organic-QD blends have\na tendency to aggregate and phase separate, due to a mismatch of their size,\nshape and surface energies.

In this paper, we propose a\ndecentralized approach, namely NetMax, that enables worker nodes to communicate\nvia high-speed links and, thus, significantly speed up the training process.\nNetMax possesses the following novel features. First, it consists of a novel\nconsensus algorithm that allows worker nodes to train model copies on their\nlocal dataset asynchronously and exchange information via peer-to-peer\ncommunication to synchronize their local copies, instead of a central master\nnode (i.e., parameter server).

These include low toughness and strength compared with\nmetals used for this purpose, and slow degradation. Blending PLLA with novel\npolyethylene glycol functionalised\npoly(L-lactide-co-$\\varepsilon$-caprolactone) (PLCL-PEG) materials has been\ninvestigated here to tailor the mechanical properties and degradation behaviour\nof PLLA. This exciting approach provides a foundation for a next generation of\nbioresorbable materials whose properties can be rapidly tuned. The degradation\nof PLLA was significantly accelerated by addition of PLCL-PEG. After 30 days of\ndegradation, several structural changes were observed in the polymer blends,\nwhich were dependent on the level of PLCL-PEG addition. Blends with low\nPLCL-PEG content displayed enthalpy relaxation, resulting in embrittlement,\nwhile blends with high PLCL-PEG content displayed crystallisation, due to\nenhanced chain mobility brought on by chain scission, also causing\nembrittlement. Moderate PLCL-PEG additions (10% PLCL(70:30)-PEG and 20 - 30%\nPLCL(80:20)-PEG) stabilised the structure, reducing the extent of enthalpy\nrelaxation and crystallisation and thus retaining ductility. Compositional\noptimisation identified a sweet spot for this blend strategy, whereby the\nductility was enhanced while maintaining strength.

The GOSSS spectral classifications and Gaia data have significantly\nimproved our ability to measure distances and determine memberships of stellar\ngroups with OB stars. AIMS.

We start with the identification and distance determinations of groups\nwith O stars. In this paper we concentrate on groups that contain stars with\nthe earliest spectral subtypes. METHODS. We use GOSSS to select Galactic\nstellar groups with O2-O3.5 stars and a method that combines Gaia DR2\nphotometry, positions, proper motions, and parallaxes to assign robust\nmemberships and measure distances. We also include the two clusters in that\npaper to generate our first list of 16 O-type Galactic stellar groups. RESULTS.\nWe derive distances, determine the membership, and analyze the structure of\nsixteen Galactic stellar groups with O stars, Villafranca O-001 to O-016,\nincluding the 14 groups with the earliest-O-type optically-accessible stars\nknown in the Milky Way. We compare our distance with previous results and\nestablish that the best consistency is with VLBI parallaxes and the worst is\nwith kinematic distances. Our results indicate that massive stars can form in\nrelatively low-mass clusters or even in near-isolation, as is the case for the\nBajamar star in the North America nebula. This lends support to the\nhierarchical scenario of star formation, where some stars are born in\nwell-defined bound clusters but others are born in associations that are\nunbound from the beginning: groups of newborn stars come in many shapes and\nsizes.

This severely constrains scalability. Proposals to\nextend the interaction range generally focus on coherent electron transport\nbetween dots or on extending the coupling range. Here, we study a setup where\nsuch an extension is obtained by using a superconductor as a quantum mediator.\nBecause of its gap, the superconductor effectively acts as a long tunnel\nbarrier. We analyze the impact of spin-orbit (SO) coupling, external magnetic\nfields, and the geometry of the superconductor. We show that while spin\nnon-conserving tunneling between the dots and the superconductor due to SO\ncoupling does not affect the exchange interaction, strong SO scattering in the\nsuperconducting bulk is detrimental.

This proposed method includes two\nloss functions such as cross entropy loss function and centre loss function.\nThen the performance of the algorithm will be evaluated using recognition rate\nand false measures. Simulation results show that the predictive performance of\nthe proposed method outperforms that of the existing classifiers such as\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN), Deep Neural Network (DNN), Artificial\nNeural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and k-Nearest Neighbours\n(KNN) in terms of accuracy and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Sep 2020 12:23:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-15"}

However, it is challenging to\nachieve robust and efficient indoor localization with two major challenges.\nFirst, the localization accuracy can be degraded by the random signal\nfluctuations, which would influence conventional localization algorithms that\nsimply learn handcrafted features from raw fingerprint data. Second, mobile\nusers are sensitive to the localization delay, but conventional indoor\nlocalization algorithms are computation-intensive and time-consuming. In this\npaper, we propose EdgeLoc, an edge-IoT framework for efficient and robust\nindoor localization using capsule networks. We develop a deep learning model\nwith the CapsNet to efficiently extract hierarchical information from WiFi\nfingerprint data, thereby significantly improving the localization accuracy.\nMoreover, we implement an edge-computing prototype system to achieve a nearly\nreal-time localization process, by enabling mobile users with the deep-learning\nmodel that has been well-trained by the edge server.

The threat space for these attacks has been studied in\nthe past, but we argue that the defining characteristics for this threat space,\nnamely the strength of the attacker, are outdated. Previous works do not study\nadversaries with vision systems that have been trained with deep neural\nnetworks because these models require large amounts of training data and\ncurating such a dataset is expensive. To address this, we create a large-scale\nsynthetic dataset to simulate the attack scenario for a keystroke inference\nattack. We show that first pre-training on synthetic data, followed by adopting\ntransfer learning techniques on real-life data, increases the performance of\nour deep learning models. This indicates that these models are able to learn\nrich, meaningful representations from our synthetic data and that training on\nthe synthetic data can help overcome the issue of having small, real-life\ndatasets for vision-based key stroke inference attacks. For this work, we focus\non single keypress classification where the input is a frame of a keypress and\nthe output is a predicted key. We are able to get an accuracy of 95.6% after\npre-training a CNN on our synthetic data and training on a small set of\nreal-life data in an adversarial domain adaptation framework.

A counterexample is\nthe celebrated Heisenberg sawtooth spin chain with ferromagnetic zigzag bonds\n$J_1$ and competing antiferromagnetic basal bonds $J_2$. At a quantum phase\ntransition point $|J_2/J_1|=1/2$, this model exhibits a flat one-magnon\nexcitation band leading to a massively degenerate ground-state manifold which\nresults in a large residual entropy. Thus, for the spin-half model, the\nresidual entropy amounts to exactly one half of its maximum value\n$\\lim_{T\\to\\infty} S(T)/N = \\ln2$.

They are often produced by\nejecting a volume of fluid through a circular orifice. The impulse given to the\nvortex rings results in a propulsive force on the generator. Propulsive vortex\nrings have been widely studied and characterised. After four convective times,\nthe vortex moves faster than the shear layer it originates from, and separates.\nThis separation corresponds to a maximum in circulation and a maximal spread of\nthe vorticity, quantified by the non-dimensional energy. The simultaneity of\nthese three events obfuscates the causality between them. To analyse the\ntemporal evolution of the non-dimensional energy of ring vortices independent\nof their separation, we analyse the development of vortices generated in the\nwake of cones. Cones with different apertures and diameters were accelerated\nfrom rest to produce a wide variety of vortex rings and their energy,\ncirculation, and velocity were extracted based on time-resolved velocity field\nmeasurements. The rings that form behind the cones have a self-induced velocity\nthat causes them to follow the cone and they continue to grow as the cone\ntravels well beyond the limiting vortex formation times scales observed for\npropulsive vortices. The non-dimensional circulation, based on the vortex\ndiameter, and the non-dimensional energy of the drag vortex rings converge\nafter three convective times to values comparable to their propulsive\ncounterparts. This result proves that vortex pinch-off does not cause the\nnon-dimensional energy to reach a minimum value. The limiting values of the\nnon-dimensional circulation and energy are mostly independent of the cone\ngeometry and translational velocity and fall within an interval of 10% around\nthe mean value.

The weak interface can produce the deviation of the\ncrack path, trapping the crack at the interface, leading to stable crack growth\nfor certain interface geometries. This idea could be used as a technical\nsolution for a new type of crack arrester, with a negligible impact on the\nglobal stiffness, strength and weight of the structure. In order to exploit\nthis concept, an experimental campaign based on photo-elasticity and digital\nimage correlation is carried out, showing the capability of curved weak\ninterfaces to arrest cracks. The experiment is repeated for several geometrical\nconfigurations through the modification of the interface curvature radii. The\nphenomenon of crack deviation and subsequent arrest at the interface is also\ninvestigated with the assistance of a computational model based on the finite\nelement method. The computational predictions provide the rationale for the\ninterpretation of the experimental observations, and distinguish between the\ndifferent behaviour of concave and convex interfaces.

To reduce the cost and allow for computations at much larger\nscales, we propose an alternative approach that is formulated based on the\nunsteady Stokes equation expressed in the time-spectral domain. This\ntransformation results in a boundary value problem with an imaginary source\nterm proportional to the computed mode that is discretized and solved in a\ncomplex-valued finite element solver using Bubnov-Galerkin formulation. This\ntransformed spatio-spectral formulation presents several advantages over the\ntraditional spatio-temporal techniques. Firstly, for cases with boundary\nconditions varying smoothly in time, it provides a significant saving in\ncomputational cost as it can resolve time-variation of the solution using a few\nmodes rather than thousands of time steps. Secondly, in contrast to the\ntraditional time integration scheme with a finite order of accuracy, this\nmethod exhibits a super convergence behavior versus the number of computed\nmodes. Thirdly, in contrast to the stabilized finite element methods for fluid,\nno stabilization term is employed in our formulation, producing a solution that\nis consistent and more accurate. Fourthly, the proposed approach is\nembarrassingly parallelizable owing to the independence of the solution modes,\nthus enabling scalable calculations at a much larger number of processors. The\ncomparison of the proposed technique against a standard stabilized finite\nelement solver is performed using two- and three-dimensional canonical and\ncomplex geometries. The results show that the proposed method can produce more\naccurate results at 1% to 11% of the cost of the standard technique for the\nstudied cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Sep 2020 17:17:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 2021 20:38:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-15"}

In this\nwork, we construct supervised learning models for images using the projected\nentangled pair states (PEPS), a two-dimensional tensor network having a similar\nstructure prior to natural images. Our approach first performs a feature map,\nwhich transforms the image data to a product state on a grid, then contracts\nthe product state to a PEPS with trainable parameters to predict image labels.\nThe tensor elements of PEPS are trained by minimizing differences between\ntraining labels and predicted labels. The proposed model is evaluated on image\nclassifications using the MNIST and the Fashion-MNIST datasets. We show that\nour model is significantly superior to existing models using tree-like tensor\nnetworks. Moreover, using the same input features, our method performs as well\nas the multilayer perceptron classifier, but with much fewer parameters and is\nmore stable. Our results shed light on potential applications of\ntwo-dimensional tensor network models in machine learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Sep 2020 09:15:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-17"}

Previous work has already identified\nseveral country-specific differences in the popularity distribution of music\nartists listened to. In particular, what constitutes the \"music mainstream\"\nstrongly varies between countries. To complement and extend these results, the\narticle at hand delivers the following major contributions: First, using\nstate-of-the-art unsupervised learning techniques, we identify and thoroughly\ninvestigate (1) country profiles of music preferences on the fine-grained level\nof music tracks (in contrast to earlier work that relied on music preferences\non the artist level) and (2) country archetypes that subsume countries sharing\nsimilar patterns of listening preferences. Second, we formulate four user\nmodels that leverage the user's country information on music preferences. Among\nothers, we propose a user modeling approach to describe a music listener as a\nvector of similarities over the identified country clusters or archetypes.\nThird, we propose a context-aware music recommendation system that leverages\nimplicit user feedback, where context is defined via the four user models. More\nprecisely, it is a multi-layer generative model based on a variational\nautoencoder, in which contextual features can influence recommendations through\na gating mechanism. Fourth, we thoroughly evaluate the proposed recommendation\nsystem and user models on a real-world corpus of more than one billion\nlistening records of users around the world (out of which we use 369 million in\nour experiments) and show its merits vis-a-vis state-of-the-art algorithms that\ndo not exploit this type of context information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Sep 2020 17:59:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-08"}

In this paper we study the impact of such\ninterventions in the capital of a developing country, Santiago, Chile, that\nexhibits large socioeconomic inequality. A distinctive feature of our study is\nthat we use granular geolocated mobile phone data to construct mobility\nmeasures that capture (1) shelter-in-place behavior, and (2) trips within the\ncity to destinations with potentially different risk profiles. Using panel data\nlinear regression models we first show that the impact of social distancing\nmeasures and lockdowns on mobility is highly heterogeneous and dependent on\nsocioeconomic levels. More specifically, our estimates indicate that while\nzones of high socioeconomic levels can exhibit reductions in mobility of around\n50\\% to 90\\% depending on the specific mobility metric used, these reductions\nare only 20\\% to 50\\% for lower-income communities. The large reductions in\nhigher-income communities are significantly driven by voluntary\nshelter-in-place behavior. Second, also using panel data methods we show that\nour mobility measures are important predictors of infections: roughly, a 10\\%\nincrease in mobility correlates with a 5\\% increase in the rate of infection.\nOur results suggest that mobility is an important factor explaining differences\nin infections rates between high and low incomes areas within the city.\nFurther, they confirm the challenges of reducing mobility in lower-income\ncommunities, where people generate their income from their daily work. To be\neffective, shelter-in-place restrictions in municipalities of low socioeconomic\nlevels may need to be complemented by other supporting measures that enable\ntheir inhabitants to increase compliance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Sep 2020 02:30:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Jun 2021 04:56:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-11"}
