WB is applied to remove the color cast\ncaused by the scene's illumination. Interactive photo-editing software allows\nusers to manually select different regions in a photo as examples of the\nillumination for WB correction (e.g., clicking on achromatic objects). Such\ninteractive editing is possible only with images saved in a RAW image format.\nThis is because RAW images have no photo-rendering operations applied and\nphoto-editing software is able to apply WB and other photo-finishing procedures\nto render the final image. Interactively editing WB in camera-rendered images\nis significantly more challenging. This is because the camera hardware has\nalready applied WB to the image and subsequent nonlinear photo-processing\nroutines. These nonlinear rendering operations make it difficult to change the\nWB post-capture. The goal of this paper is to allow interactive WB manipulation\nof camera-rendered images. The proposed method is an extension of our recent\nwork \\cite{afifi2019color} that proposed a post-capture method for WB\ncorrection based on nonlinear color-mapping functions. Here, we introduce a new\nframework that links the nonlinear color-mapping functions directly to\nuser-selected colors to enable {\\it interactive} WB manipulation. This new\nframework is also more efficient in terms of memory and run-time (99\\%\nreduction in memory and 3$\\times$ speed-up). Lastly, we describe how our\nframework can leverage a simple illumination estimation method (i.e.,\ngray-world) to perform auto-WB correction that is on a par with the WB\ncorrection results in \\cite{afifi2019color}.

However this abstraction can often result\nin the programmer having to rely on some in built choices and with this\nimplicit parallelism, with little assistance by the programmer, the scalability\nand performance of the code heavily depends on the compiler and choice of\napplication.\n  We propose an approach, type oriented programming, where all aspects of\nparallelism are encoded via types and the type system. The type information\nassociated by the programmer will determine, for instance, how an array is\nallocated, partitioned and distributed. With this rich, high level of\ninformation the compiler can generate an efficient target executable. If the\nprogrammer wishes to omit detailed type information then the compiler will rely\non well documented and safe default behaviour which can be tuned at a later\ndate with the addition of types.\n  The type oriented parallel programming language Mesham, which follows the\nPGAS memory model, is presented.

Extreme scaling of these methods can be\ndifficult, however, since global communication to form dot products is\ntypically required at every iteration.\n  To try to overcome this limitation we propose a hybrid approach, where the\nmatrix is partitioned into blocks. Within each block, we use a highly optimised\n(parallel) conventional solver, but we then couple the blocks together using\nblock Jacobi or some other multisplitting technique that can be implemented in\neither a synchronous or an asynchronous fashion. This allows us to limit the\nblock size to the point where the conventional iterative methods no longer\nscale, and to avoid global communication (and possibly synchronisation) across\nall processes.\n  Our block framework has been built to use PETSc, a popular scientific suite\nfor solving sparse linear systems, as the synchronous intra-block solver, and\nwe demonstrate results on up to 32768 cores of a Cray XE6 system. At this\nscale, the conventional solvers are still more efficient, though trends suggest\nthat the hybrid approach may be beneficial at higher core counts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Sep 2020 16:44:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-29"}

The explanations from 13 different\nattribution methods were rated by a panel of 14 clinicians for clinical\nsignificance. Feedback was obtained from the clinicians regarding the current\nand future scope of such methods.\n  Results: An attribution method based on a Taylor series expansion, called\nDeep Taylor was rated the highest by clinicians with a median rating of 3.85/5.\nIt was followed by two other attribution methods, Guided backpropagation and\nSHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations).\n  Conclusion: Explanations of deep learning models can make them more\ntransparent for clinical diagnosis. This study compared different explanations\nmethods in the context of retinal OCT diagnosis and found that the best\nperforming method may not be the one considered best for other deep learning\ntasks. Overall, there was a high degree of acceptance from the clinicians\nsurveyed in the study.\n  Keywords: explainable AI, deep learning, machine learning, image processing,\nOptical coherence tomography, retina, Diabetic macular edema, Choroidal\nNeovascularization, Drusen\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Sep 2020 17:17:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Mar 2021 20:13:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-26"}

Numerical tools to study DDEs have played a significant role not\nonly in illustrating theoretical results but also in discovering interesting\ndynamics of the model. DDE-Biftool, which is a Matlab package for numerical\ncontinuation and numerical bifurcation analysis of DDEs, is one of the most\nutilized and popular numerical tools for DDEs.

One\nlikely solution relies on synaptic positive feedback loops, prominently\nincluding persistent activation of CaM kinase II (CaMKII) and self-activated\nsynthesis of protein kinase M zeta (PKM). Recent studies also suggest positive\nfeedback based on recurrent synaptic reactivation within neuron assemblies, or\nengrams, is necessary to maintain memories. The relative importance of these\nfeedback mechanisms is controversial. To explore the likelihood that each\nmechanism is necessary or sufficient, we simulated LTP maintenance with a\nsimplified model incorporating persistent kinase activation, synaptic tagging,\nand preferential reactivation of strong synapses, and analyzed implications of\nrecent data. We simulated three model variants, each maintaining LTP with one\nfeedback loop: self-activated PKM synthesis (variant I); self-activated CamKII\n(variant II); and recurrent reactivation of strengthened synapses (variant\nIII). Variant I requires and predicts that PKM must contribute to synaptic\ntagging. Variant II maintains LTP and suggests persistent CaMKII activation\ncould maintain PKM activity, a feedforward interaction not previously\nconsidered. However we note data challenging this feedback loop. In variant III\nsynaptic reactivation drives, and thus predicts, recurrent or persistent\nactivity elevations of CamKII and other necessary kinases, plausibly\ncontributing to empirically persistent elevation of PKM levels. Reactivation is\nthus predicted to sustain recurrent rounds of synaptic tagging and\nincorporation of plasticity-related proteins. We also suggest (model variant\nIV) that synaptic reactivation and autonomous kinase activation could\nsynergistically maintain LTP. We propose experiments that could discriminate\nthese maintenance mechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Sep 2020 21:57:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-29"}

The success of the AA-based algorithm stems from\nseveral developments rather than a single breakthrough (and without these, our\ntests demonstrate that AA fails catastrophically). To begin, we ensure the\nmonotonicity of the likelihood function (a the key feature of the standard EM\nalgorithm) with a recently proposed monotonicity-control algorithm (Henderson\nand Varahdan 2019), enhanced by a novel monotonicity test with little overhead.\nWe propose nimble strategies for AA to preserve the positive definiteness of\nthe Gaussian weights and covariance matrices strictly, and to conserve up to\nthe second moments of the observed data set exactly. Finally, we employ a\nK-means clustering algorithm using the gap statistic to avoid excessively\noverestimating the initial number of components, thereby maximizing\nperformance. We demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the algorithm with\nseveral synthetic data sets that are mixtures of Gaussians distributions of\nknown number of components, as well as data sets generated from\nparticle-in-cell simulations. Our numerical results demonstrate speed-ups with\nrespect to non-accelerated EM of up to 60X when the exact number of mixture\ncomponents is known, and between a few and more than an order of magnitude with\ncomponent adaptivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Sep 2020 22:55:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-29"}

We extend this approach to test learning of local and\nnon-local phonological processes that include approximations of morphological\nprocesses. We further parallel outputs of the model to results of a behavioral\nexperiment where human subjects are trained on the data used for training the\nGAN network. Four main conclusions emerge: (i) the networks provide useful\ninformation for computational models of speech acquisition even if trained on a\ncomparatively small dataset of an artificial grammar learning experiment; (ii)\nlocal processes are easier to learn than non-local processes, which matches\nboth behavioral data in human subjects and typology in the world's languages.\nThis paper also proposes (iii) how we can actively observe the network's\nprogress in learning and explore the effect of training steps on learning\nrepresentations by keeping latent space constant across different training\nsteps. Finally, this paper shows that (iv) the network learns to encode the\npresence of a prefix with a single latent variable; by interpolating this\nvariable, we can actively observe the operation of a non-local phonological\nprocess. The proposed technique for retrieving learning representations has\ngeneral implications for our understanding of how GANs discretize continuous\nspeech data and suggests that rule-like generalizations in the training data\nare represented as an interaction between variables in the network's latent\nspace.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Sep 2020 00:02:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Jul 2021 07:28:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-14"}

The reason is\nthat neural networks fail to accommodate the distribution drift of the input\ndata caused by adversarial perturbations. Here, we present a new solution -\nBeneficial Perturbation Network (BPN) - to defend against adversarial attacks\nby fixing the distribution drift. During training, BPN generates and leverages\nbeneficial perturbations (somewhat opposite to well-known adversarial\nperturbations) by adding new, out-of-network biasing units. Biasing units\ninfluence the parameter space of the network, to preempt and neutralize future\nadversarial perturbations on input data samples. To achieve this, BPN creates\nreverse adversarial attacks during training, with very little cost, by\nrecycling the training gradients already computed.

A secure DOC architecture with attack diagnosis is proposed\nthat guarantees the attack-free subsystems to achieve the output consensus\nwhich minimizes the sum of their objective functions, while the attacked\nsubsystems converge to preset secure states. A two-layer DOC structure is\nestablished with emphasis on the interactions between cyber and physical\nlayers, where a command-driven control law is designed that generates provable\noptimal output consensus. Differing from the existing fault diagnosis methods\nwhich are generally applicable to given failure types, the focus of the attack\ndiagnosis is to achieve detection and isolation for arbitrary malicious\nbehaviors. To this end, double coupling residuals are generated by a\ncarefully-designed distributed filter. The adaptive thresholds with prescribed\nperformance are designed to enhance the detectability and isolability. It is\ntheoretically guaranteed that any attack signal cannot bypass the designed\nattack diagnosis methodology to destroy the convergence of the DOC algorithm,\nand the locally-occurring detectable attack can be isolated from the\npropagating attacks from neighboring subsystems.

This paper presents STAN\n(Synthetic network Traffic generation with Autoregressive Neural models), a\ntool to generate realistic synthetic network traffic datasets for subsequent\ndownstream applications. Our novel neural architecture captures both temporal\ndependencies and dependence between attributes at any given time.

We evaluate the\nperformance of STAN in terms of the quality of data generated, by training it\non both a simulated dataset and a real network traffic data set. Finally, to\nanswer the question - can real network traffic data be substituted with\nsynthetic data to train models of comparable accuracy? We train two anomaly\ndetection models based on self-supervision. The results show only a small\ndecline in the accuracy of models trained solely on synthetic data. While\ncurrent results are encouraging in terms of quality of data generated and\nabsence of any obvious data leakage from training data, in the future we plan\nto further validate this fact by conducting privacy attacks on the generated\ndata.

For\nexample, the classes '0' and '6' are very similar in terms of their beginning\nparts; therefore it is nearly impossible to predict their subsequent parts from\nthe beginning part.

It has also been\nfinding a great variety of applications in machine learning. In a parametric\nsetup, it has been extensively studied. However, in the statistical learning\ncontext where a function is typically learned in a nonparametric way, there is\nstill a lack of theoretical understanding of how Huber regression estimators\nlearn the conditional mean function and why it works in the absence of\nlight-tailed noise assumptions. To address these fundamental questions, we\nconduct an assessment of Huber regression from a statistical learning\nviewpoint. First, we show that the usual risk consistency property of Huber\nregression estimators, which is usually pursued in machine learning, cannot\nguarantee their learnability in mean regression. Second, we argue that Huber\nregression should be implemented in an adaptive way to perform mean regression,\nimplying that one needs to tune the scale parameter in accordance with the\nsample size and the moment condition of the noise. Third, with an adaptive\nchoice of the scale parameter, we demonstrate that Huber regression estimators\ncan be asymptotic mean regression calibrated under $(1+\\epsilon)$-moment\nconditions ($\\epsilon>0$). Last but not least, under the same moment\nconditions, we establish almost sure convergence rates for Huber regression\nestimators. Note that the $(1+\\epsilon)$-moment conditions accommodate the\nspecial case where the response variable possesses infinite variance and so the\nestablished convergence rates justify the robustness feature of Huber\nregression estimators. In the above senses, the present study provides a\nsystematic statistical learning assessment of Huber regression estimators and\njustifies their merits in terms of robustness from a theoretical viewpoint.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Sep 2020 06:08:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-29"}

The degree of arc curvature\ndepends on the distance to the scattering plasma and its transverse velocity\nwith respect to the line-of-sight. We report the observation of annual and\norbital variations in the curvature of scintillation arcs over a period of 16\nyears for the bright millisecond pulsar, PSR J0437-4715. These variations are\nthe signature of the relative transverse motions of the Earth, pulsar, and\nscattering medium, which we model to obtain precise measurements of parameters\nof the pulsar's binary orbit and the scattering medium itself. We observe two\nclear scintillation arcs in most of our $>$5000 observations and we show that\nthey originate from scattering by thin screens located at distances $D_1 = 89.8\n\\pm 0.4$ pc and $D_2 = 124 \\pm 3$ pc from Earth.

Using scintillation arcs for precise astrometry and\norbital dynamics can be superior to modelling variations in the diffractive\nscintillation timescale, because the arc curvature is independent of variations\nin the level of turbulence of interstellar plasma. This technique can be used\nin combination with pulsar timing to determine the full three-dimensional\norbital geometries of binary pulsars, and provides parameters essential for\ntesting theories of gravity and constraining neutron star masses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Sep 2020 06:14:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-02"}

In FL, a set of edge devices train a model using their\nlocal data, while repeatedly exchanging their trained updates with a central\nserver. This procedure allows tuning a centralized model in a distributed\nfashion without having the users share their possibly private data. In this\npaper, we focus on over-the-air (OTA) FL, which has been suggested recently to\nreduce the communication overhead of FL due to the repeated transmissions of\nthe model updates by a large number of users over the wireless channel. In OTA\nFL, all users simultaneously transmit their updates as analog signals over a\nmultiple access channel, and the server receives a superposition of the analog\ntransmitted signals. However, this approach results in the channel noise\ndirectly affecting the optimization procedure, which may degrade the accuracy\nof the trained model. We develop a Convergent OTA FL (COTAF) algorithm which\nenhances the common local stochastic gradient descent (SGD) FL algorithm,\nintroducing precoding at the users and scaling at the server, which gradually\nmitigates the effect of the noise. We analyze the convergence of COTAF to the\nloss minimizing model and quantify the effect of a statistically heterogeneous\nsetup, i.e. when the training data of each user obeys a different distribution.\nOur analysis reveals the ability of COTAF to achieve a convergence rate similar\nto that achievable over error-free channels.

The\nresults indicate that the spray flame propagation speed is enhanced with\nincreased droplet mass loading and/or evaporation heat exchange coefficient (or\nevaporation rate). Opposite trends are found when the latent heat is high, due\nto strong evaporation heat absorption. Fuel vapor and temperature gradients are\nobserved in the post-flame evaporation zone of heterogeneous flames.\nEvaporation completion front location considerably changes with flame radius,\nbut the evaporation onset location varies little relative to the flame front\nwhen the flame propagates.

However, the\ninteraction of the defects with reactive environment, such as ambient,\ndecreases the efficiency of functionalization and makes it poorly controlled.\nHere, we report a novel approach to generate, monitor with time resolution, and\nfunctionalize the defects $\\textit{in situ}$ without ever exposing them to the\nambient. The defects are generated by an energetic Argon plasma and their\nproperties are monitored using $\\textit{in situ}$ Raman spectroscopy.

Here, by applying a dual-pump\nlaser excitation, first with a linearly polarized (LP) laser pulse followed by\na circularly polarized (CP) laser pulse, we identify the timescales and\ncontribution from heating and helicity effects in HD-AOS with a Pt/Co/Pt triple\nlayer.

By varying the time delay between the two pump pulses,\nwe show that the helicity effect, which gives rise to the deterministic\nhelicity induced switching, onsets instantly upon laser excitation, and only\nexists for less than 0.2 ps close to the laser pulse duration of 0.15 ps. The\nresults reveal that that the transient magnetization state upon which CP laser\npulses impinge is the key factor for achieving HD-AOS, and importantly, the\ntunability between heating and helicity effects with the unique dual-pump laser\nexcitation approach will enable HD-AOS in a wide range of magnetic material\nsystems for the potential ultrafast spintronics applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Sep 2020 10:39:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-29"}

Unfortunately, classical theory on optimal experimental design focuses\non selecting examples in order to learn underparameterized (and thus,\nnon-interpolative) models, while modern machine learning models such as deep\nneural networks are overparameterized, and oftentimes are trained to be\ninterpolative. As such, classical experimental design methods are not\napplicable in many modern learning setups.

Here we build upon\nthe notion of the posterior similarity matrix (PSM) in order to suggest new\napproaches for summarising the output of MCMC algorithms for Bayesian\nclustering models. A key contribution of our work is the observation that PSMs\nare positive semi-definite, and hence can be used to define\nprobabilistically-motivated kernel matrices that capture the clustering\nstructure present in the data. This observation enables us to employ a range of\nkernel methods to obtain summary clusterings, and otherwise exploit the\ninformation summarised by PSMs. For example, if we have multiple PSMs, each\ncorresponding to a different dataset on a common set of statistical units, we\nmay use standard methods for combining kernels in order to perform integrative\nclustering.

In particular, electric-field driven metal-insulator\ntransitions are well-known as the resistive switching effect in a variety of\nmaterials, such as VO$_2$, V$_2$O$_3$ and other transition metal oxides. To\nsatisfactorily explain both the phenomenology and its underlying mechanism, it\nis required to model microscopically the out-of-equilibrium dissipative lattice\nsystem of interacting electrons. In this thesis, we developed a systematic\nmethod of modeling non-equilibrium steady states for dissipative lattice\nsystems by means of Non-equilibrium Green's function and Dynamical Mean Field\nTheory. We firstly establish a \"minimum model\" to formulate the strong-field\ntransport in non-interacting dissipative electron lattice.

The formalism is then combined with Dynamical Mean\nField Theory to provide a systematic framework describing the nonequilibrium\nsteady-state of correlated materials.

For the square step barrier of height $V_0$, we derive\nexplicit expressions for the density and for the kernel.

A\nsalient example is continual learning - learning new independent tasks\nsequentially without forgetting previous tasks. Continual learning of multiple\ntasks in artificial neural networks using gradient descent leads to\ncatastrophic forgetting, whereby a previously learned mapping of an old task is\nerased when learning new mappings for new tasks.

We further analyze FTL from privacy\nand machine learning perspective.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Sep 2020 19:46:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 23 Jan 2021 18:07:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 6 Mar 2021 10:20:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-09"}

However, experimental realization of space-time modulation is\nhighly non-trivial, hindering many interesting physics that are theoretically\npredicted to be experimentally demonstrated. Here, based on the proposed\nvirtualized metamaterials with software-defined impulse response, we\nexperimentally realize non-Hermitian space-time varying metamaterials for\nefficient and asymmetric frequency conversion by allowing material gain and\nloss to be tailor-made and balanced in the time domain. In the application of\nfrequency conversion, the combination of space-time varying capability and\nnon-Hermiticity allows us to diminish the main band through gain-loss balance\nand to increase the efficiency of side band conversion at the same time. In\naddition, our approach of software-defined metamaterials is flexible to realize\nthe analogy of quantum interference in an acoustic system with design\ncapability. Applying an additional modulation phase delay between different\natoms allows to control such interference to get asymmetric amplification in\nfrequency conversion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Sep 2020 14:28:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-13"}

Power control and optimal\nscheduling can significantly improve the wireless multicast network's\nperformance under fading. However, the model based approaches for power control\nand scheduling studied earlier are not scalable to large state space or\nchanging system dynamics. In this paper, we use deep reinforcement learning\nwhere we use function approximation of the Q-function via a deep neural network\nto obtain a power control policy that matches the optimal policy for a small\nnetwork. We show that power control policy can be learnt for reasonably large\nsystems via this approach. Further we use multi-timescale stochastic\noptimization to maintain the average power constraint. We demonstrate that a\nslight modification of the learning algorithm allows tracking of time varying\nsystem statistics. Finally, we extend the multi-timescale approach to\nsimultaneously learn the optimal queueing strategy along with power control. We\ndemonstrate scalability, tracking and cross layer optimization capabilities of\nour algorithms via simulations. The proposed multi-timescale approach can be\nused in general large state space dynamical systems with multiple objectives\nand constraints, and may be of independent interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Sep 2020 15:59:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-08"}

In this paper it\nhas been shown that despite the chaos, the behaviour of such a reactor can be\npredictable. It has been shown that this phenomenon can occur in two cases. The\nfirst case concerns intermittent chaos. It has been shown that intermittent\noutbursts can occur at regular intervals. The second case concerns transient\nchaos, i.e. a situation when the chaos occurs only for a certain period of\ntime, e.g. only during start-up. This phenomenon makes it impossible to predict\nwhat will occur in the reactor in the nearest time, but, makes it possible to\nprecisely determine the values of the variables even in the distant future.\nBoth of these phenomena were tested by numerical simulation of the mathematical\nmodel of the reactor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Sep 2020 18:50:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-08"}
