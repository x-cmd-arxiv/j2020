In this work, we first develop a general method to compute\nthe EPR of scalar Langevin field theories with additive noise. This large class\nof theories includes active versions of Model A (non-conserved density\ndynamics) and Model B (conserved) and also models where both types of dynamics\nare simultaneously present (such as Model AB). Treating the scalar field $\\phi$\n(and its time derivative $\\dot\\phi$) as the sole observable(s), we arrive at an\nexpression for the EPR that is non-negative for every field configuration and\nis quadratic in the time-antisymmetric component of the dynamics. Our general\nexpression is a function of the quasipotential, which determines the full\nprobability distribution for configurations, and is not generally calculable.\nTo alleviate this difficulty, we present a small-noise expansion of the EPR,\nwhich only requires knowledge of the deterministic (mean-field) solution for\nthe scalar field in steady state, which generally is calculable, at least\nnumerically. We demonstrate this calculation for the case of Model AB.

In addition, it is also reasonable to study the utilization of RS\ndata in inventory sampling, which can further improve the estimation of forest\nvariables. In this study, we propose a data sampling method based on Bayesian\noptimization which uses RS data in forest inventory sample selection. The\npresented method applies the learned functional relationship between the RS and\ninventory data in new sampling decisions. We evaluate our method by conducting\nsimulated sampling experiments with both synthetic data and measured data from\nthe Aland region in Finland. The proposed method is benchmarked against two\nbaseline methods: simple random sampling and the local pivotal method. The\nresults of the simulated experiments show the best results in terms of MSE\nvalues for the proposed method when the functional relationship between RS and\ninventory data is correctly learned from the available training data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2020 17:05:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-18"}

The orientation of the spin axis of a comet is defined by the values\nof its equatorial obliquity and its cometocentric longitude of the Sun.

The spin-axis orientation of 1I/2017 U1 (`Oumuamua) remains to be\ndetermined; for 2I/Borisov, the already released results are mutually\nexclusive. Here, we investigate the orientation of the spin axes of `Oumuamua\nand 2I/Borisov using public orbit determinations that consider outgassing.\n  Methods. We applied a Monte Carlo simulation using the covariance matrix\nmethod together with Monte Carlo random search techniques to compute the\ndistributions of equatorial obliquities and cometocentric longitudes of the Sun\nat perihelion of `Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov from the values of the\nnongravitational parameters.\n  Results. We find that the equatorial obliquity of `Oumuamua could be about 93\ndeg, if it has a very prolate (fusiform) shape, or close to 16 deg, if it is\nvery oblate (disk-like).

The most probable spin-axis direction of `Oumuamua in equatorial\ncoordinates is (280 degrees, +46 degrees) if very prolate or (312 deg, -50 deg)\nif very oblate.

In-DRAM caches work to mitigate this latency by augmenting\nregular-latency DRAM with small-but-fast regions of DRAM that serve as a cache\nfor the data held in the regular-latency region of DRAM. While an effective\nin-DRAM cache can allow a large fraction of memory requests to be served from a\nfast DRAM region, the latency savings are often hindered by inefficient\nmechanisms for relocating copies of data into and out of the fast regions.\nExisting in-DRAM caches have two sources of inefficiency: (1) the data\nrelocation granularity is an entire multi-kilobyte row of DRAM; and (2) because\nthe relocation latency increases with the physical distance between the slow\nand fast regions, multiple fast regions are physically interleaved among slow\nregions to reduce the relocation latency, resulting in increased hardware area\nand manufacturing complexity. We propose a new substrate, FIGARO, that uses\nexisting shared global buffers among subarrays within a DRAM bank to provide\nsupport for in-DRAM data relocation across subarrays at the granularity of a\nsingle cache block. FIGARO has a distance-independent latency within a DRAM\nbank, and avoids complex modifications to DRAM. Using FIGARO, we design a\nfine-grained in-DRAM cache called FIGCache.

One starburst galaxy shows irregular morphology\nwhich may indicate a major merger, while the other two systems show disc-like\nmorpho-kinematics. The two disc-like starbursts show molecular gas velocity\ndispersion values comparable with that seen in local LIRG/ULIRGs, but in an ISM\nwith molecular gas fraction and surface density values consistent to that\nreported for local star-forming galaxies.

Existing\napproaches based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) excel at generating\nrealistic samples, but seek to generate typical samples, rather than extreme\nsamples. Hence, in this work, we propose ExGAN, a GAN-based approach to\ngenerate realistic and extreme samples. To model the extremes of the training\ndistribution in a principled way, our work draws from Extreme Value Theory\n(EVT), a probabilistic approach for modelling the extreme tails of\ndistributions. For practical utility, our framework allows the user to specify\nboth the desired extremeness measure, as well as the desired extremeness\nprobability they wish to sample at. Experiments on real US Precipitation data\nshow that our method generates realistic samples, based on visual inspection\nand quantitative measures, in an efficient manner.

Aims: We present the MUSE Deep Lensed Field\n(MDLF) program. Methods: We describe Deep MUSE observations of 17.1 hours\nintegration on a single pointing over the Hubble Frontier Field galaxy cluster\nMACS~J0416. Results: We confirm spectroscopic redshifts for all 136 multiple\nimages of 48 source galaxies at 0.9<z<6.2. Within those galaxies, we securely\nidentify 182 multiple images of 66 galaxy components that we use to constrain\nour lens model. We identify 116 clumps belonging to background high-z galaxies;\nthe majority of them are multiple images and span magnitude, size and redshift\nintervals of [-18,-10], [~400-3] parsec and 1<z<6.6, respectively, with the\nmost magnified ones probing possible single gravitationally bound star\nclusters. The depth of the MDLF combined with lensing magnification lead us to\nreach a detection limit for unresolved emission lines of a few 10$^{-20}$\nerg/s/cm2, after correction for lensing magnification. Ultraviolet\nhigh-ionization metal lines (and HeII1640) are detected with S/N>10 for\nindividual objects down to de-lensed magnitude 28-30 suggesting that they are\ncommon in such faint sources. Conclusions:Deep MUSE observations, in\ncombination with existing HST imaging, allowed us to:(1) confirm redshifts for\nextremely faint high-z sources;(2) peer into their internal clumps (down to\n100-200 pc scale);(3) in some cases break down such clumps into bound star\nclusters (<20 pc scale);(4) double the number of constraints for the lens\nmodel,reaching an unprecedented set of 182 bona-fide multiple images and\nconfirming up to 213 galaxy cluster members.

A\nmajor issue in the inference of the tidal parameters (or directly of the\nequation of state) is the systematic error introduced by the waveform\napproximants. We use a bottom-up approach based on gauge-invariant phase\nanalysis and the Fisher information matrix to investigate waveform systematics\nand help identifying biases in parameter estimation. A mock analysis of 15\ndifferent binaries indicates that systematics in current waveform models\ndominate over statistical errors at signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) ${\\gtrsim} 80$.\nThis implies biases in the inference of the reduced tidal parameter that are\nare larger than the statistical $90\\%$ credible-intervals. For example, while\nthe neutron-star radius could be constrained at ${\\sim} 5\\%$ level at SNR 80,\nsystematics can be at the ${\\sim} 10\\%$ level. We apply our approach to\nGW170817 (SNR ${\\sim}30$) and confirm that no significant systematic effects\nare present.

ESO320-G030 is a double-barred isolated spiral, but its compact\nand obscured nuclear starburst (SFR~15 Msun/yr; Av~40 mag) resembles those of\nmore luminous ULIRGs. In the outflow, the 1-0/2-1 ratio is enhanced with\nrespect to the rest of the galaxy and the CO(4-3) transition is undetected.\nThis indicates that the outflowing molecular gas is less excited than the gas\nin the nuclear starburst (launching site) and the galaxy disk. Non-LTE\nradiative transfer modeling reveals that the properties of the outflow\nmolecular clouds differ from those of the nuclear and disk clouds: The kinetic\ntemperature is lower (~9 K) in the outflow, and the outflowing clouds have\nlower column densities. Assuming a 10^-4 CO abundance, the large internal\nvelocity gradients, 60^+250_-45 km/s/pc, imply that the outflowing molecular\nclouds are not bound by self-gravity. All this suggests that the life-cycle\n(formation, collapse, dissipation) of the disk clouds might differ from that of\nthe outflowing clouds which might not be able to form stars. The low Tkin of\nthe molecular outflow remains constant up to 1.7 kpc. This indicates that the\nheating by the hotter ionized outflow phase is not efficient and may favor the\nsurvival of the outflow molecular phase. The velocity structure of the outflow\nshows a 0.8 km/s/pc velocity gradient between 190-560 pc and then a constant\nmaximum velocity (~750 km/s) up to 1.7 kpc. This is compatible with a pure\ngravitational evolution of the outflow under certain mass outflow rate and\nlaunching velocity variations. Alternatively, ram pressure acceleration and\ncloud evaporation could explain the observed kinematics and size of the\nmolecular phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2020 18:03:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-11"}

This prompts the question to what extent OTOCs display chaotic\nbehaviour in horizonless microstate geometries. This question is complicated by\nthe fact that Lyapunov growth of OTOCs requires nonzero temperature, whereas\nconstructions of microstate geometries have been mostly restricted to extremal\nblack holes.\n  In this paper, we compute OTOCs for a class of extremal black holes, namely\nmaximally rotating BTZ black holes, and show that on average they display \"slow\nscrambling\", characterized by cubic (rather than exponential) growth.\nSuperposed on this average power-law growth is a sawtooth pattern, whose steep\nparts correspond to brief periods of Lyapunov growth associated to the nonzero\ntemperature of the right-moving degrees of freedom in a dual conformal field\ntheory.\n  Next we study the extent to which these OTOCs are modified in certain\n\"superstrata\", horizonless microstate geometries corresponding to these black\nholes. Rather than an infinite throat ending on a horizon, these geometries\nhave a very deep but finite throat ending in a cap. We find that the\nsuperstrata display the same slow scrambling as maximally rotating BTZ black\nholes, except that for large enough time intervals the growth of the OTOC is\ncut off by effects related to the cap region, some of which we evaluate\nexplicitly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2020 20:28:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2020 00:15:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 9 Mar 2021 19:43:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-11"}

Moreover, the computer\nvision community tends to use direct space methods to make such classifications\ninstead of more powerful and computationally efficient Fourier space methods.\nThis is because the proper functioning of those methods requires more periodic\nrepeats of a unit cell motif than are commonly present in images analyzed by\nthe computer vision community.

Our main tool is\na classification of lattice polygons with two points than can simultaneously\nview all others, without having any one point that can observe all others.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Sep 2020 00:30:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2021 23:26:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-28"}

The realization of high coercivity at\nfinite temperatures is a burning issue. One of the important ingredients for\ncontrolling the coercive force is the surface property of magnetic grains. It\nhas been reported by first-principles studies that the Nd atoms in the first\n(001) surface layer facing the vacuum have in-plane anisotropy perpendicular to\nthe $c$ axis, which may decrease the coercivity. Focusing on the surface\nanisotropy effect on the coercivity, we examine the coercivity at zero and\nfinite temperatures by using an atomistic model reflecting the lattice\nstructure of the Nd magnet with a stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation\nmethod. We study general three cases, in which the Nd atoms in surface layers\nhave (1) no anisotropy, (2) in-plane anisotropy, and (3) reinforced anisotropy\nfor two types of surfaces, (001) and (100) surfaces. We find that in contrast\nto the zero-temperature case, due to the thermal fluctuation effect, the\nmodification of only the first surface layer has little effect on the\ncoercivity at finite temperatures. However, the modification of a few layers\nresults in significant effects. We discuss the details of the dependence of the\ncoercivity on temperature, type of surface, and modified layer depth, and also\nthe features of domain growth in magnetization reversal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Sep 2020 00:44:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-20"}

By providing a comprehensive\ndual solution path for trend filtering, PRUTF allows us to discover change\npoints of the underlying signal for either a given value of the regularization\nparameter or a specific number of steps of the algorithm. We demonstrate that\nthe dual solution path constitutes a Gaussian bridge process that enables us to\nderive an exact and efficient stopping rule for terminating the search\nalgorithm. We also prove that the estimates produced by this algorithm are\nasymptotically consistent in pattern recovery. This result holds even in the\ncase of staircases (consecutive change points of the same sign) in the signal.\nFinally, we investigate the performance of our proposed method for various\nsignals and then compare its performance against some state-of-the-art methods\nin the context of change point detection.

MLC encourages a popular framework named label compression\n(LC) for capturing label dependency with dimension reduction. Nevertheless,\nmost existing LC methods failed to consider the influence of the feature space\nor misguided by original problematic features, so that may result in\nperformance degeneration. In this paper, we present a compact learning (CL)\nframework to embed the features and labels simultaneously and with mutual\nguidance. The proposal is a versatile concept, hence the embedding way is\narbitrary and independent of the subsequent learning process. Following its\nspirit, a simple yet effective implementation called compact multi-label\nlearning (CMLL) is proposed to learn a compact low-dimensional representation\nfor both spaces. CMLL maximizes the dependence between the embedded spaces of\nthe labels and features, and minimizes the loss of label space recovery\nconcurrently. Theoretically, we provide a general analysis for different\nembedding methods. Practically, we conduct extensive experiments to validate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Sep 2020 03:19:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-21"}

Moreover, just as studying gene\nexpression patterns in one organism can reveal general principles that apply to\nother organisms, the study of complex social interactions in an experimentally\ntractable model system, such as a laboratory ant colony, can provide general\nprinciples about the dynamics of other social groups. Here, we focus on one\nsuch example from the study of reproductive regulation in small laboratory\ncolonies of more than 50 Harpegnathos ants. These ants can be artificially\ninduced to begin a ~20 day process of hierarchy reformation. Although the\nconclusion of this process is conspicuous to a human observer, it remains\nunclear which behaviors during the transient period are contributing to the\nprocess. To address this issue, we explore the potential application of\nOne-class Classification (OC) to the detection of abnormal states in ant\ncolonies for which behavioral data is only available for the normal societal\nconditions during training. Specifically, we build upon the Deep Support Vector\nData Description (DSVDD) and introduce the Inner-Outlier Generator (IO-GEN)\nthat synthesizes fake \"inner outlier\" observations during training that are\nnear the center of the DSVDD data description. We show that IO-GEN increases\nthe reliability of the final OC classifier relative to other DSVDD baselines.\nThis method can be used to screen video frames for which additional human\nobservation is needed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Sep 2020 04:48:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 14 Aug 2021 21:18:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-31"}

Our study stems from the consideration of constructing universal\ncapacity-achieving codes under low-complexity decoding algorithms, where\nuniversality refers to the fact that we are considering a family of channels\nwith equal capacity. Consider, e.g., the right-regular sequence by Shokrollahi\nand the heavy-tail Poisson sequence by Luby $\\textit{et al}$. Both sequences\nare provably capacity-achieving under belief propagation (BP) decoding when\ntransmission takes place over the binary erasure channel (BEC).\n  In this paper we show that many existing capacity-achieving sequences of LDPC\ncodes are not universal under BP decoding. We reveal that the key to showing\nthis non-universality result is determined by the stability of the underlying\ncodes. More concretely, for an ordered and complete channel family and a\nsequence of LDPC code ensembles, we determine a stability threshold associated\nwith them, which further gives rise to a sufficient condition such that the\nsequence is not universal under BP decoding. Furthermore, we show that the same\nstability threshold applies to blockwise or bitwise MAP decoding as well. We\npresent how stability can determine an upper bound on the corresponding\nblockwise or bitwise MAP threshold, revealing the operational significance of\nthe stability threshold.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Sep 2020 06:11:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-21"}

Reproducing the observed $k_2$ value and rate of apsidal\nmotion simultaneously with the other stellar parameters requires a significant\namount of internal mixing or enhanced mass-loss. The results suggest that a\nsingle-star evolution model is sufficient to describe the physics inside this\nbinary system. Qualitatively, the high turbulent diffusion required to\nreproduce the observations could be partly attributed to stellar rotation.\nHigher-order terms in the apsidal motion are negligible. Only a very severe\nmisalignment of the rotation axes could significantly impact the rate of\napsidal motion, but such a high misalignment is highly unlikely in such a\nbinary system.

Particularly, it has been shown that a\nmonaural speech separation task can be successfully solved with a DNN-based\nmethod called deep clustering (DC), which uses a DNN to describe the process of\nassigning a continuous vector to each time-frequency (TF) bin and measure how\nlikely each pair of TF bins is to be dominated by the same speaker. In DC, the\nDNN is trained so that the embedding vectors for the TF bins dominated by the\nsame speaker are forced to get close to each other. One concern regarding DC is\nthat the embedding process described by a DNN has a black-box structure, which\nis usually very hard to interpret. The potential weakness owing to the\nnon-interpretable black-box structure is that it lacks the flexibility of\naddressing the mismatch between training and test conditions (caused by\nreverberation, for instance). To overcome this limitation, in this paper, we\npropose the concept of explainable deep clustering (X-DC), whose network\narchitecture can be interpreted as a process of fitting learnable spectrogram\ntemplates to an input spectrogram followed by Wiener filtering. During\ntraining, the elements of the spectrogram templates and their activations are\nconstrained to be non-negative, which facilitates the sparsity of their values\nand thus improves interpretability. The main advantage of this framework is\nthat it naturally allows us to incorporate a model adaptation mechanism into\nthe network thanks to its physically interpretable structure. We experimentally\nshow that the proposed X-DC enables us to visualize and understand the clues\nfor the model to determine the embedding vectors while achieving speech\nseparation performance comparable to that of the original DC models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Sep 2020 07:26:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Feb 2021 06:44:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 19 Apr 2021 06:53:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-20"}

Specifically,\ninstead of using an encoder-decoder framework as previous methods, we formulate\nthe restoration of LQ face images as a multi-scale progressive restoration\nprocedure through semantic-aware style transformation. Given a pair of LQ face\nimage and its corresponding parsing map, we first generate a multi-scale\npyramid of the inputs, and then progressively modulate different scale features\nfrom coarse-to-fine in a semantic-aware style transfer way.

They give rise to fluctuations in the cosmic microwave\nbackground (CMB) temperature and polarisation, and to large-scale structures in\nour universe. They can also trigger the formation of primordial black holes\n(PBHs). Such objects could provide the progenitors of the recently detected\nblack-hole mergers, and constitute part or all of the dark matter. Their\nobservation would give invaluable access to parts of the inflationary sector\nthat are unconstrained by the CMB. Since PBHs require large inhomogeneities to\nform, they are produced in scenarios where quantum fluctuations substantially\nmodify the dynamics of the universe. In this habilitation thesis, this\n\"backreaction\" effect is investigated using the stochastic inflation formalism,\nan effective theory for the long-wavelengths of quantum fields during\ninflation, which can be described in a classical but stochastic way once the\nsmall wavelengths have been integrated out. It describes an inflating\nbackground that gets randomly corrected by the vacuum quantum fluctuations as\nthey get stretched to large distances. After a brief review of the stochastic\ninflation formalism, we explain how it can be combined with standard techniques\nof cosmological perturbation theory (the $\\delta N$ formalism) to provide the\nfull probability density function of curvature perturbations in the presence of\nnon-perturbative quantum diffusion. These results are then applied to PBHs,\nwhere we show that quantum diffusion can change the expected abundance by\nseveral orders of magnitude. Finally, since inflationary models giving rise to\ncosmologically relevant PBHs often feature violations of slow roll, the\nstochastic-$\\delta N$ formalism is generalised to non slow-roll dynamics.

The CII line\nprovides the kinematics of the gas and is one of the dominant cooling lines of\ngas for low to moderate densities and UV fields.

Design and optimization of such structures can be carried out by\nnonlocal continuum mechanics which is computationally convenient when compared\nto atomistic strategies. Bishop's kinematics is able to describe small-scale\nthick rods if a proper mathematical model of nonlocal elasticity is formulated\nto capture size effects. In all papers on the matter, nonlocal contributions\nare evaluated by replacing Eringen's integral convolution with the consequent\n(but not equivalent) differential equation governed by Helmholtz's differential\noperator. As notorious in integral equation theory, this replacement is\npossible for convolutions, defined in unbounded domains, governed by averaging\nkernels which are Green's functions of differential operators. Indeed, Eringen\nhimself, in order to study nonlocal problems defined in unbounded domains, such\nas screw dislocations and wave propagations, suggested to replace\nintegro-differential equations with differential conditions. A different\nscenario appears in Bishop rod mechanics where nonlocal integral convolutions\nare defined in bounded structural domains, so that Eringen's nonlocal\ndifferential equation has to be supplemented with additional boundary\nconditions. The objective is achieved by formulating the governing nonlocal\nequations by a proper variational statement. The new methodology provides an\namendment of previous contributions in literature and is illustrated by\ninvestigating the elastostatic behavior of simple structural schemes.

Most moving object detection algorithms have been\ndesigned for color images without depth. For robotic navigation where real-time\nRGB-D data is often readily available, utilization of the depth information\nwould be beneficial for obstacle recognition.\n  Here, we propose a simple moving object detection algorithm that uses RGB-D\nimages. The proposed algorithm does not require estimating a background model.\nInstead, it uses an occlusion model which enables us to estimate the camera\npose on a background confused with moving objects that dominate the scene. The\nproposed algorithm allows to separate the moving object detection and visual\nodometry (VO) so that an arbitrary robust VO method can be employed in a\ndynamic situation with a combination of moving object detection, whereas other\nVO algorithms for a dynamic environment are inseparable. In this paper, we use\ndense visual odometry (DVO) as a VO method with a bi-square regression weight.\nExperimental results show the segmentation accuracy and the performance\nimprovement of DVO in the situations.

A compressible form (HGO-C model) is widely\nused in finite element simulations whereby the isotropic part of \\Psi is\ndecoupled into volumetric and isochoric parts and the anisotropic part of \\Psi\nis expressed in terms of isochoric invariants. Here, by using three simple\ndeformations (pure dilatation, pure shear and uniaxial stretch), we demonstrate\nthat the compressible HGO-C formulation does not correctly model compressible\nanisotropic material behaviour, because the anisotropic component of the model\nis insensitive to volumetric deformation due to the use of isochoric\nanisotropic invariants. In order to correctly model compressible anisotropic\nbehaviour we present a modified anisotropic (MA) model, whereby the full\nanisotropic invariants are used, so that a volumetric anisotropic contribution\nis represented. The MA model correctly predicts an anisotropic response to\nhydrostatic tensile loading, whereby a sphere deforms into an ellipsoid.

To look at more practical applications, we developed a finite\nelement user-defined material subroutine for the simulation of stent deployment\nin a slightly compressible artery.

Reusing it on its polytope $\\Pi$ is too conservative, however,\nbecause any $\\Pi$ is a state space set with a common affine law $x\\rightarrow\n(u_0^\\prime (x), \\dots, u_{N-1}^\\prime (x))^\\prime\\in\\mathbb{R}^{Nm}$ for the\nentire horizon $N$. We show a simple criterion exists for identifying the\npolytopes that have a common $x\\rightarrow u_0(x)$, but may differ with respect\nto $u_1(x), \\dots, u_{N-1}(x)$. Because this criterion is too computationally\nexpensive for an online use, we introduce a simple heuristics for the fast\nconstruction of a subset of the polytopes of interest. Computational examples\nshow (i) a considerable fraction of QPs can be avoided (10% to 40%) and (ii)\nthe heuristics results in a reduction very close to the maximum one that could\nbe achieved if the explicit solution was available. We stress the proposed\napproach is intended for use in online MPC and it does not require the explicit\nsolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Sep 2020 12:03:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-21"}

Capacity region enlargement is also known to be possible by using\nonly passive noisy feedback, when the GBC has identical noise variances at the\nreceivers. The last fact remains true even when the feedback noise variance is\nvery high, and available only from one of the receivers. While such capacity\nenlargements are feasible for several other feedback models in the Gaussian BC\nsetting, it is also known that feedback does not change the capacity region for\nphysically degraded broadcast channels. In this paper, we consider a two user\nGBC with independent noise realizations at the receivers, where the feedback\nlinks from the receivers are corrupted by independent additive Gaussian noise\nprocesses. We investigate the set of four noise variances, two forward and two\nfeedback, for which no capacity enlargement is possible. A sharp\ncharacterization of this region is derived, i.e., any quadruple outside the\npresented region will lead to a capacity enlargement, whereas quadruples inside\nwill leave the capacity region unchanged. Our results lead to the conclusion\nthat when the forward noise variances are different, too noisy a feedback from\none of the receivers alone is not always beneficial for enlarging the capacity\nregion, be it from the stronger user or the weaker one, in sharp contrast to\nthe case of equal forward noise variances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Sep 2020 12:06:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-21"}

In a few more recent works, where only\none source, say, $X$, is compressed and the other one, $Y$, serves as side\ninformation available at the decoder, the scope is extended to variable-rate\nS-W (VRSW) codes, where the rate is allowed to depend on the type class of the\nsource string, but still, the random-binning distribution is assumed uniform\nwithin the corresponding, type-dependent, bin index set.\n  In this expository work, we investigate the role of the uniformity of the\nrandom binning distribution from the perspective of the trade-off between the\nreliability (defined in terms of the error exponent) and the compression\nperformance (measured from the viewpoint of the source coding exponent). To\nthis end, we study a much wider class of random-binning distributions, which\nincludes the ensemble of VRSW codes as a special case, but it also goes\nconsiderably beyond.

Notwithstanding this finding, the wider class of\nensembles proposed is motivated in two ways. The first is that it outperforms\nVRSW codes in the above-mentioned pathological cases, and the second is that it\nallows robustness: in the event of a system failure that causes unavailability\nof the compressed bit-stream from one of the sources, it still allows\nreconstruction of the other source within some controllable distortion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Sep 2020 13:53:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-21"}

When a forensic expert determines a high\nLR for DNA found at a crime scene matching the DNA profile of a suspect they\ntypically report that 'this provides strong support for the prosecution\nhypothesis that the DNA comes from the suspect'. However, even with a high LR,\nthe evidence might not support the prosecution hypothesis if the defence\nhypothesis used to determine the LR is not the negation of the prosecution\nhypothesis (such as when the alternative is 'DNA comes from a person unrelated\nto the defendant' instead of 'DNA does not come from the suspect'). For DNA\nmixture profiles, especially low template DNA (LTDNA), the value of a high LR\nfor a 'match' - typically computed from probabilistic genotyping software - can\nbe especially questionable. But this is not just because of the use of\nnon-exhaustive hypotheses in such cases. In contrast to single profile DNA\n'matches', where the only residual uncertainty is whether a person other than\nthe suspect has the same matching DNA profile, it is possible for all the\ngenotypes of the suspect's DNA profile to appear at each locus of a DNA\nmixture, even though none of the contributors has that DNA profile. In fact, in\nthe absence of other evidence, we show it is possible to have a very high LR\nfor the hypothesis 'suspect is included in the mixture' even though the\nposterior probability that the suspect is included is very low. Yet, in such\ncases a forensic expert will generally still report a high LR as 'strong\nsupport for the suspect being a contributor'. Our observations suggest that, in\ncertain circumstances, the use of the LR may have led lawyers and jurors into\ngrossly overestimating the probative value of a LTDNA mixed profile 'match'\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Sep 2020 14:15:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-21"}

They are\nvery fragile to percolation and first-neighbor failure propagation, but little\nis known about how they respond to non-local disruptions, as it occurs in\nfailures induced by flow redistribution, for example. Acknowledging that many\nsocio-technical and biological systems sustain a flow of some physical\nquantity, such as energy or information, across the their components, it\nbecomes crucial to understand when the flow redistribution can cause global\ncascades of failures in order to design robust systems,to increase their\nresilience or to learn how to efficiently dismantle them. In this paper we\nstudy the impact that different multiplex topological features have on the\nrobustness of the system when subjected to non-local cascade propagation. We\nfirst numerically demonstrate that this dynamics has a critical value at which\na small initial perturbation effectively dismantles the entire network, and\nthat the transition appears abruptly. Then we identify that the excess of flow\ncaused by a failure is, in general, more homogeneously distributed the networks\nin which the average distance between nodes is small.Using this information we\nfind that aggregated versions of multiplex networks tend to overestimate\nrobustness, even though to make the system more robust can be achieved by\nincreasing the number of layers.

Due to this limitation of using prior knowledge about the\ntarget object, feature matching, which compares template features representing\nthe target object with input features, is an essential step. Recently,\npixel-level matching (PM), which matches every pixel in template features and\ninput features, has been widely used for feature matching because of its high\nperformance. However, despite its effectiveness, the information used to build\nthe template features is limited to the initial and previous frames.

Furthermore, we apply self-attention to the similarity maps\ngenerated from PM to capture global dependencies.

We perform\ndetailed line analysis and modelling of H$_{2}$D$^{+}$ 110 -111 and\nN$_{2}$H$^{+}$ 4-3 emission at 372 GHz, using 2'x2' maps (JCMT). Our goal is to\ntest the most prominent dynamical models by comparing the modelled gas\nkinematics and spatial distribution (H$_{2}$D$^{+}$ and N$_{2}$H$^{+}$) with\nobservations towards four prestellar (L1544, L183, L694-2, L1517B) and one\nprotostellar core (L1521f). We perform a detailed non-LTE radiative transfer\nmodelling using RATRAN, where we compare the predicted spatial distribution and\nline profiles of H$_{2}$D$^{+}$ and N$_{2}$H$^{+}$ with observations towards\nall cores. To do so, we adopt the physical structure for each core predicted by\nthree different dynamical models taken from literature: Quasi-Equilibrium\nBonnor-Ebert Sphere (QE-BES), Singular Isothermal Sphere (SIS), and\nLarson-Penston (LP) flow. Our analysis provides an updated picture of the\nphysical structure of prestellar cores. We find that the SIS model can be\nclearly excluded in explaining the gas emission towards the cores, but a larger\nsample is required to differentiate clearly between the LP flow, the QE-BES and\nthe static models. All models of collapse underestimate the intensity of the\ngas emission by up to several factors towards the only protostellar core in our\nsample, indicating that different dynamics take place in different evolutionary\ncore stages. If the LP model is confirmed towards a larger sample of prestellar\ncores, it would indicate that they may form by compression or accretion of gas\nfrom larger scales. If the QE-BES model is confirmed, it means that quasi\nhydrostatic cores can exist within turbulent ISM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Sep 2020 14:26:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-04"}

The radiative\nenergy loss is based on an extension of the Gunion-Bertsch matrix element for a\nmassive projectile and a massive radiated gluon. On top of that, the coherence\n(LPM effect) is implemented by assigning a formation phase to the trial\nradiated gluons in a fashion similar to the approach in JHEP 07 (2011), 118, by\nZapp, Stachel and Wiedemann. In a calculation with a simplified radiation\nkernel, we reproduce the radiation spectrum reported in the approach above. The\nradiation spectrum produces the LPM behaviour $dI/d\\omega\\propto\\omega^{-1/2}$\nup to an energy $\\omega=\\omega_c$, when the formation length of radiated gluons\nbecomes comparable to the size of the medium. Beyond $\\omega_c$, the radiation\nspectrum shows a characteristic suppression due to a smaller probability for a\ngluon to be formed in-medium.\n  Next, we embed the radiative energy loss of low-virtuality jet partons into a\nmore realistic \"parton gun\" calculation, where a stream of hard partons at high\ninitial energy $E_\\text{ini}=100$ GeV and initial virtuality $Q^2=E^2$ passes\nthrough a box of QGP medium with a constant temperature. At the end of the box\nevolution, the partons are hadronized using Pythia 8, and the jets are\nreconstructed with the FASTJET package.

In\ncontrast, the thermoelectric voltage measured across monolayer graphene\n(MLG)-NW heterostructures shows anomalous large-amplitude oscillations around\nthe Dirac point, not seen in the Mott response derived from the electrical\nconductivity measured on the same device. The anomalous oscillations are a\nsignature of the modified density of states in MLG by the electrostatic\npotential of the NW, which is much weaker in the NW-BLG devices.

The previous work has shown that\nCNNs have the potential of breaking the cryptographic algorithm protected with\nmasking or desynchronization. Before, several CNN models have been exploited,\nreaching the same or even better level of performance compared to the\ntraditional side-channel attack (SCA). In this paper, we investigate the\narchitecture of Residual Network and build a new CNN model called attention\nnetwork. To enhance the power of the attention network, we introduce an\nattention mechanism - Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) and\nincorporate CBAM into the CNN architecture. CBAM points out the informative\npoints of the input traces and makes the attention network focus on the\nrelevant leakages of the measurements. It is able to improve the performance of\nthe CNNs.

However,\nreal-world time-series data have neither a similar length nor a same number of\nobservations. They also have missing entries, which hinders the performance of\npredictive tasks. In this paper, we approach these issues by presenting a model\nfor the combined task of imputing and predicting values for the irregularly\nobserved and varying length time-series data with missing entries. Our proposed\nmodel (Bi-GAN) uses a bidirectional recurrent network in a generative\nadversarial setting. The generator is a bidirectional recurrent network that\nreceives actual incomplete data and imputes the missing values. The\ndiscriminator attempts to discriminate between the actual and the imputed\nvalues in the output of the generator. Our model learns how to impute missing\nelements in-between (imputation) or outside of the input time steps\n(prediction), hence working as an effective any-time prediction tool for\ntime-series data.

By leveraging the distributions of occupations across the US\nurban areas, we identify industrial topics - clusters of occupations based on\ntheir co-existence pattern. Industrial topics indicate the mechanisms under the\nsystematic allocation of different occupations. Considering the densely\nconnected occupations as an industrial topic, our approach characterizes\nregional economies by their topical composition. Unlike the existing\nsurvey-based top-down approach, our method provides timely information about\nthe underlying structure of the regional economy, which is critical for\npolicymakers and business leaders, especially in our fast-changing economy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Sep 2020 02:07:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-22"}

Each rational individual can get a more reasonable\nstrategy by comprehensively considering the time cost.

The individuals in the rule network are divided into 2\ngroups: high-time cost and low-time cost. 2. Each individual is endowed with a\ntime cost parameter, and the individuals take into account the effect of time\ncost on the benefit when they interact with a neighbour. The synchronous\nupdating algorithm is used to study the evolution of cooperation with time cost\non a regular lattice. Simulation results show that the proposed mechanism\neffectively promotes cooperation in the snowdrift game. Moreover, it is\nrevealed that the following reasons lead to a higher level of cooperation: The\nhigher time cost, the more individuals of high-time cost in the group, and the\nmore differences of time cost between groups when low-time cost remains\nunchanged.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Sep 2020 13:57:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-28"}

In the\nterahertz frequency range, electrically pumped semiconductor quantum cascade\nlasers (QCLs) are suitable candidates for frequency comb and dual-comb\noperation. For a single laser frequency comb, the repetition rate can be locked\nusing a microwave injection locking and the carrier frequency can be locked to\na highly stable source. However, for the locking of two laser combs, four\nfrequencies (two repetition rates and two carrier offset frequencies) should be\nsimultaneously locked; If one only refers to the dual-comb signal, two relative\nfrequencies, i.e., the offset frequency and repetition frequency of one laser\nagainst those of the other laser, should be locked. Although the locking\ntechniques that have been successfully used for a single laser comb can be, in\nprinciple, applied to a dual-comb laser source, the complete locking\nconsiderably complicates the implementation of such a system. Here, we propose\na method to stabilize a terahertz QCL dual-comb source by phase locking one of\nthe dual-comb lines to a radio frequency (RF) synthesizer. This technique\nforces one of the lasers to follow the tone of the other one (keeping the sum\nof the carrier offset frequency difference and repetition frequency difference\nbetween the two laser combs as a constant) by exploiting a laser self-detection\nthat avoids the use of an external detector. Through the demonstration of this\nlocking technique, we demonstrate that the dual-comb can generate periodic\npulses over a 2 us time scale, showing that the terahertz QCL comb without a\ncontrol of the repetition rate can produce pulsed-type waveforms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Sep 2020 06:55:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 13 Feb 2021 00:23:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-26"}
