Studies in this area usually take into\nconsideration different behavioural strategies and investigate how they can be\nfixed in the population under evolving rules. However, how those strategies\nemerged from basic evolutionary mechanisms continues to be not fully\nunderstood. To address this issue, here we study the emergence of cooperative\nstrategies through a model of heuristics selection based on evolutionary\nalgorithms. In the proposed model, agents interact with other players according\nto a heuristic specified by their genetic code and reproduce -- at a longer\ntime scale -- proportionally to their fitness. We show that the system can\nevolve to cooperative regimes for low mutation rates through heuristics\nselection while increasing the mutation decreases the level of cooperation. Our\nanalysis of possible strategies shows that reciprocity and punishment are the\nmain ingredients for cooperation to emerge, being conditional cooperation the\nmore frequent strategy. Additionally, we show that if in addition to\nbehavioural rules, genetic relatedness is included, then kinship plays a\nrelevant role. Our results illustrate that our evolutionary heuristics model is\na generic and powerful tool to study the evolution of cooperative behaviour.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Sep 2020 16:36:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-17"}

In particular, the underlying mathematics of stochastic linear\nregression itself as an entity usually gets either a peripheral treatment or a\nrelatively in-depth but ad hoc treatment depending on the type of concerned\nproblems; in other words, compared to the extensiveness of the study of\nmathematical properties of the \"derivatives\" of stochastic linear regression\nsuch as the least squares estimator, the mathematics of stochastic linear\nregression itself seems to have not yet received a due intrinsic treatment.\nApart from the conceptual importance, a consequence of an insufficient or\npossibly inaccurate understanding of stochastic linear regression would be the\nrecurrence for the role of stochastic linear regression in the important (and\nmore sophisticated) context of structural equation modeling to be misperceived\nor taught in a misleading way. We believe this pity is rectifiable when the\nfundamental concepts are correctly classified. Accompanied by some\nillustrative, distinguishing examples and counterexamples, we intend to pave\nout the mathematical framework for stochastic linear regression, in a rigorous\nbut non-technical way, by giving new results and pasting together several\nfundamental known results that are, we believe, both enlightening and\nconceptually useful, and that had not yet been systematically documented in the\nrelated literature. As a minor contribution, the way we arrange the fundamental\nknown results would be the first attempt in the related literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Sep 2020 16:55:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 2020 10:15:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 8 Oct 2020 12:36:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-09"}

Prior work with CNNs and RNNs has demonstrated the benefit of\nmixture of experts, where the predictions of multiple domain expert classifiers\nare combined; as well as domain adversarial training, to induce a domain\nagnostic representation space. Inspired by this, we investigate how such\nmethods can be effectively applied to large pretrained transformer models. We\nfind that domain adversarial training has an effect on the learned\nrepresentations of these models while having little effect on their\nperformance, suggesting that large transformer-based models are already\nrelatively robust across domains. Additionally, we show that mixture of experts\nleads to significant performance improvements by comparing several variants of\nmixing functions, including one novel mixture based on attention. Finally, we\ndemonstrate that the predictions of large pretrained transformer based domain\nexperts are highly homogenous, making it challenging to learn effective\nfunctions for mixing their predictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Sep 2020 16:56:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-17"}

We carry out\nnon-ideal MHD simulations to explore the role of microphysics on disc formation\nand the interplay between ambipolar diffusion (AD) and Hall effect during the\nprotostellar collapse. We find that removing the smallest grain population\n($\\lesssim$10 nm) from the standard MRN size distribution is sufficient for\nenabling disc formation. Further varying the grain sizes can result in either a\nHall-dominated or an AD-dominated collapse; both form discs of tens of AU in\nsize regardless of the magnetic field polarity. The direction of disc rotation\nis bimodal in the Hall dominated collapse but unimodal in the AD-dominated\ncollapse. We also find that AD and Hall effect can operate either with or\nagainst each other in both radial and azimuthal directions, yet the combined\neffect of AD and Hall is to move the magnetic field radially outward relative\nto the infalling envelope matter. In addition, microphysics and magnetic field\npolarity can leave profound imprints both on observables (e.g., outflow\nmorphology, disc to stellar mass ratio) and on the magnetic field\ncharacteristics of protoplanetary discs. Including Hall effect relaxes the\nrequirements on microphysics for disc formation, so that prestellar cores with\ncosmic-ray ionization rate of $\\lesssim$2--3$\\times10^{-16}$ s$^{-1}$ can still\nform small discs of $\\lesssim$10 AU radius.

Nevertheless it is currently not well understood how accurately humans\ncan assess weight and height from images, and when and how they fail. To bridge\nthis gap, we start from 1,682 images of persons collected from the Web, each\nannotated with the true weight and height, and ask crowd workers to estimate\nthe weight and height for each image. We conduct a faceted analysis taking into\naccount characteristics of the images as well as the crowd workers assessing\nthe images, revealing several novel findings: (1) Even after aggregation, the\ncrowd's accuracy is overall low. (2) We find strong evidence of contraction\nbias toward a reference value, such that the weight (height) of light (short)\npeople is overestimated, whereas that of heavy (tall) people is underestimated.\n(3) We estimate workers' individual reference values using a Bayesian model,\nfinding that reference values strongly correlate with workers' own height and\nweight, indicating that workers are better at estimating people similar to\nthemselves. (4) The weight of tall people is underestimated more than that of\nshort people; yet, knowing the height decreases the weight error only mildly.\n(5) Accuracy is higher on images of females than of males, but female and male\nworkers are no different in terms of accuracy. (6) Crowd workers improve over\ntime if given feedback on previous guesses. Finally, we explore various bias\ncorrection models for improving the crowd's accuracy, but find that this only\nleads to modest gains.

We propose GOLD (generation by off-policy\nlearning from demonstrations): an easy-to-optimize algorithm that learns from\nthe demonstrations by importance weighting. Intuitively, GOLD upweights\nconfident tokens and downweights unconfident ones in the reference during\ntraining, avoiding optimization issues faced by prior RL approaches that rely\non online data collection. According to both automatic and human evaluation,\nmodels trained by GOLD outperform those trained by MLE and policy gradient on\nsummarization, question generation, and machine translation. Further, our\nmodels are less sensitive to decoding algorithms and alleviate exposure bias.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Sep 2020 17:58:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Mar 2021 03:43:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-04"}

By direct\nmanipulation of the Schrodinger equation, we write down simple \"equations of\nmotion\" for the coefficients which determine the wavefunction. Rather than\nspecify a particular interaction Hamiltonian, we assume only very basic\nproperties (unitarity, de Sitter invariance and locality) to derive general\nconsequences for the wavefunction's evolution. In particular, we identify a\nnumber of \"constants of motion\": properties of the initial state which are\nconserved by any unitary dynamics. We further constrain the time evolution by\nderiving constraints from the de Sitter isometries and show that these reduce\nto the familiar conformal Ward identities at late times. Finally, we show how\nthe evolution of a state from the conformal boundary into the bulk can be\ndescribed via a number of \"transfer functions\" which are analytic outside the\nhorizon for any local interaction. These objects exhibit divergences for\nparticular values of the scalar mass, and we show how such divergences can be\nremoved by a renormalisation of the boundary wavefunction - this is equivalent\nto performing a \"Boundary Operator Expansion\" which expresses the bulk\noperators in terms of regulated boundary operators.

In this paper, we deal\nwith the problem of separating mixed X-ray images originating from the\nradiography of double-sided paintings. Using the visible color images (RGB\nimages) from each side of the painting, we propose a new Neural Network\narchitecture, based upon 'connected' auto-encoders, designed to separate the\nmixed X-ray image into two simulated X-ray images corresponding to each side.\nIn this proposed architecture, the convolutional auto encoders extract features\nfrom the RGB images. These features are then used to (1) reproduce both of the\noriginal RGB images, (2) reconstruct the hypothetical separated X-ray images,\nand (3) regenerate the mixed X-ray image. The algorithm operates in a totally\nself-supervised fashion without requiring a sample set that contains both the\nmixed X-ray images and the separated ones. The methodology was tested on images\nfrom the double-sided wing panels of the \\textsl{Ghent Altarpiece}, painted in\n1432 by the brothers Hubert and Jan van Eyck.

In recent years, online multi-capacity ridesharing services (i.e.,\nwhere assignments are made online) like Uber-pool, foodpanda, and on-demand\nshuttles have become hugely popular in transportation, food delivery, logistics\nand other domains. This is because multi-capacity ridesharing services benefit\nall parties involved { the customers (due to lower costs), the drivers (due to\nhigher revenues) and the matching platforms (due to higher revenues per\nvehicle/resource). Most importantly these services can also help reduce carbon\nemissions (due to fewer vehicles on roads).\n  Online multi-capacity ridesharing is extremely challenging as the underlying\nmatching graph is no longer bipartite (as in the unit-capacity case) but a\ntripartite graph with resources (e.g., taxis, cars), requests and request\ngroups (combinations of requests that can travel together). The desired\nmatching between resources and request groups is constrained by the edges\nbetween requests and request groups in this tripartite graph (i.e., a request\ncan be part of at most one request group in the final assignment). While there\nhave been myopic heuristic approaches employed for solving the online\nmulti-capacity ridesharing problem, they do not provide any guarantees on the\nsolution quality. To that end, this paper presents the first approach with\nbounds on the competitive ratio for online multi-capacity ridesharing (when\nresources rejoin the system at their initial location/depot after serving a\ngroup of requests).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Sep 2020 20:29:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-18"}

One of the key avenues for doing this is studying the\nmicrolensing Einstein radius crossing time distribution ($t_E$). However,\nsystematics in individual light curves as well as over-simplistic modeling can\nlead to biased results. To address this, we developed a model to simultaneously\nhandle the microlensing parallax due to Earth's motion, systematic instrumental\neffects, and unlensed stellar variability with a Gaussian Process model. We\nused light curves for nearly 10,000 OGLE-III and IV Milky Way bulge\nmicrolensing events and fit each with our model. We also developed a forward\nmodel approach to infer the timescale distribution by forward modeling from the\ndata rather than using point estimates from individual events. We find that\nmodeling the variability in the baseline removes a source of significant bias\nin individual events, and previous analyses over-estimated the number of long\ntimescale ($t_E>100$ days) events due to their over simplistic models ignoring\nparallax effects and stellar variability.

Knowledge graph completion (also known\nas relation prediction) is the task of inferring missing facts given existing\nones. Most of the existing work is proposed by maximizing the likelihood of\nobserved instance-level triples. Not much attention, however, is paid to the\nontological information, such as type information of entities and relations. In\nthis work, we propose a type-augmented relation prediction (TaRP) method, where\nwe apply both the type information and instance-level information for relation\nprediction. In particular, type information and instance-level information are\nencoded as prior probabilities and likelihoods of relations respectively, and\nare combined by following Bayes' rule. Our proposed TaRP method achieves\nsignificantly better performance than state-of-the-art methods on four\nbenchmark datasets: FB15K, FB15K-237, YAGO26K-906, and DB111K-174.

These objects possess the highest jet\npowers and luminosities and have black hole masses often in excess of $10^9$\nsolar masses. In addition, high-$z$ blazars are important cosmological probes\nand serve as test objects for blazar evolution models. Due to their large\ndistance, their high-energy emission typically peaks below the GeV range, which\nmakes them difficult to study with Fermi/LAT. Therefore, only the very\nbrightest objects are detectable and, to date, only a small number of high-z\nblazars have been detected with Fermi/LAT. In this work, we studied the monthly\nbinned long-term $\\gamma$-ray emission of a sample of 176 radio and optically\ndetected blazars that have not been reported as known $\\gamma$-ray sources in\nthe 3FGL catalog. In order to account for false-positive detections, we\ncalculated monthly Fermi/LAT light curves for a large sample of blank sky\npositions and derived the number of random fluctuations that we expect at\nvarious test statistic (TS) levels. For a given blazar, a detection of TS > 9\nin at least one month is expected $\\sim 15\\%$ of the time.

They are important\nfor the brain's navigational system and specific memory tasks. A bump attractor\nis characterised by a core in which neurons fire frequently, while those away\nfrom the core do not fire. We uncover a relationship between bump attractors\nand travelling waves in a classical network of excitable, leaky\nintegrate-and-fire neurons. This relationship bears strong similarities to the\none between complex spatiotemporal patterns and waves at the onset of pipe\nturbulence. Waves in the spiking network are determined by a firing set, that\nis, the collection of times at which neurons reach a threshold and fire as the\nwave propagates. We define and study analytical properties of the voltage\nmapping, an operator transforming a solution's firing set into its\nspatiotemporal profile. This operator allows us to construct localised\ntravelling waves with an arbitrary number of spikes at the core, and to study\ntheir linear stability. A homogeneous \"laminar\" state exists in the network,\nand it is linearly stable for all values of the principal control parameter.\nSufficiently wide disturbances to the homogeneous state elicit the bump\nattractor. We show that one can construct waves with a seemingly arbitrary\nnumber of spikes at the core; the higher the number of spikes, the slower the\nwave, and the more its profile resembles a stationary bump. As in the\nfluid-dynamical analogy, such waves coexist with the homogeneous state, are\nunstable, and the solution branches to which they belong are disconnected from\nthe laminar state; we provide evidence that the dynamics of the bump attractor\ndisplays echoes of the unstable waves, which form its building blocks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Sep 2020 22:19:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Dec 2021 18:23:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-15"}

In just one round, each client distills their private\ndataset, sends the synthetic data (e.g. images or sentences) to the server, and\ncollectively trains a global model. The distilled data look like noise and are\nonly useful to the specific model weights, i.e., become useless after the model\nupdates. With this weight-less and gradient-less design, the total\ncommunication cost of DOSFL is up to three orders of magnitude less than FedAvg\nwhile preserving between 93% to 99% performance of a centralized counterpart.\nAfterwards, clients could switch to traditional methods such as FedAvg to\nfinetune the last few percent to fit personalized local models with local\ndatasets. Through comprehensive experiments, we show the accuracy and\ncommunication performance of DOSFL on both vision and language tasks with\ndifferent models including CNN, LSTM, Transformer, etc. We demonstrate that an\neavesdropping attacker cannot properly train a good model using the leaked\ndistilled data, without knowing the initial model weights.

For\ndestructive cases where new boundaries emerge during the loading process, we\npropose a coupling scheme where the PD-MPM is applied to the cracked region and\nthe PD-BEM is applied to the un-cracked region such that the time of\ncomputation can be significantly reduced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2020 01:42:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Sep 2020 09:01:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 31 Jan 2021 11:13:40 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 31 May 2021 16:13:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-01"}

As a classic CO problem, deep hashing aims\nto find an optimal code for each data from finite discrete possibilities, while\nthe discrete nature brings a big challenge to the optimization process.\nPrevious methods usually mitigate this challenge by binary approximation,\nsubstituting binary codes for real-values via activation functions or\nregularizations. However, such approximation leads to uncertainty between\nreal-values and binary ones, degrading retrieval performance. In this paper, we\npropose a novel Deep Momentum Uncertainty Hashing (DMUH). It explicitly\nestimates the uncertainty during training and leverages the uncertainty\ninformation to guide the approximation process. Specifically, we model\nbit-level uncertainty via measuring the discrepancy between the output of a\nhashing network and that of a momentum-updated network. The discrepancy of each\nbit indicates the uncertainty of the hashing network to the approximate output\nof that bit. Meanwhile, the mean discrepancy of all bits in a hashing code can\nbe regarded as image-level uncertainty. It embodies the uncertainty of the\nhashing network to the corresponding input image. The hashing bit and image\nwith higher uncertainty are paid more attention during optimization. To the\nbest of our knowledge, this is the first work to study the uncertainty in\nhashing bits.

Over\nthe past two decades, target decoy approaches (TDAs) and decoy-free approaches\n(DFAs), have been widely used to estimate FDR. TDAs use a database of decoy\nspecies to faithfully model score distributions of incorrect peptide-spectrum\nmatches (PSMs). DFAs, on the other hand, fit two-component mixture models to\nlearn the parameters of correct and incorrect PSM score distributions. While\nconceptually straightforward, both approaches lead to problems in practice,\nparticularly in experiments that push instrumentation to the limit and generate\nlow fragmentation-efficiency and low signal-to-noise-ratio spectra. Results: We\nintroduce a new decoy-free framework for FDR estimation that generalizes\npresent DFAs while exploiting more search data in a manner similar to TDAs. Our\napproach relies on multi-component mixtures, in which score distributions\ncorresponding to the correct PSMs, best incorrect PSMs, and second-best\nincorrect PSMs are modeled by the skew normal family. We derive EM algorithms\nto estimate parameters of these distributions from the scores of best and\nsecond-best PSMs associated with each experimental spectrum. We evaluate our\nmodels on multiple proteomics datasets and a HeLa cell digest case study\nconsisting of more than a million spectra in total. We provide evidence of\nimproved performance over existing DFAs and improved stability and speed over\nTDAs without any performance degradation. We propose that the new strategy has\nthe potential to extend beyond peptide identification and reduce the need for\nTDA on all analytical platforms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2020 02:22:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-18"}

ShapeAssembly\nprograms construct shapes by declaring cuboid part proxies and attaching them\nto one another, in a hierarchical and symmetrical fashion. Its functions are\nparameterized with free variables, so that one program structure is able to\ncapture a family of related shapes. We show how to extract ShapeAssembly\nprograms from existing shape structures in the PartNet dataset. Then we train a\ndeep generative model, a hierarchical sequence VAE, that learns to write novel\nShapeAssembly programs. The program captures the subset of variability that is\ninterpretable and editable. The deep model captures correlations across shape\ncollections that are hard to express procedurally. We evaluate our approach by\ncomparing shapes output by our generated programs to those from other recent\nshape structure synthesis models. We find that our generated shapes are more\nplausible and physically-valid than those of other methods. Additionally, we\nassess the latent spaces of these models, and find that ours is better\nstructured and produces smoother interpolations. As an application, we use our\ngenerative model and differentiable program interpreter to infer and fit shape\nprograms to unstructured geometry, such as point clouds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2020 02:26:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-21"}

In this paper, we propose to reproduce\nsuch an inherent capability of the human-being within a computer vision system.\nThe proposed system consists of three modules. To explore the relationship\nbetween music and dance movements, we propose a cross-modal alignment module\nthat focuses on dancing video clips, accompanied on pre-designed music, to\nlearn a system that can judge the consistency between the visual features of\npose sequences and the acoustic features of music. The learned model is then\nused in the imagination module to select a pose sequence for the given music.\nSuch pose sequence selected from the music, however, is usually discontinuous.\nTo solve this problem, in the spatial-temporal alignment module we develop a\nspatial alignment algorithm based on the tendency and periodicity of dance\nmovements to predict dance movements between discontinuous fragments. In\naddition, the selected pose sequence is often misaligned with the music beat.\nTo solve this problem, we further develop a temporal alignment algorithm to\nalign the rhythm of music and dance. Finally, the processed pose sequence is\nused to synthesize realistic dancing videos in the imagination module. The\ngenerated dancing videos match the content and rhythm of the music.\nExperimental results and subjective evaluations show that the proposed approach\ncan perform the function of generating promising dancing videos by inputting\nmusic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2020 02:29:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 7 Aug 2021 09:14:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-01"}

Two signal decomposition methods,\nincluding the empirical wavelet transform (EWT) and Fourier decomposition\nmethod (FDM), have been developed based on Fourier theory. However, the EWT can\nsuffer from a mode mixing problem for signals with closely-spaced modes and\ndecomposition results by FDM can suffer from an inconsistency problem. An\naccurate adaptive signal decomposition method, called the empirical Fourier\ndecomposition (EFD), is proposed to solve the problems in this work. The\nproposed EFD combines the uses of an improved Fourier spectrum segmentation\ntechnique and an ideal filter bank. The segmentation technique can solve the\ninconsistency problem by predefining the number of modes in a signal to be\ndecomposed and filter functions in the ideal filter bank have no transition\nphases, which can solve the mode mixing problem. Numerical investigations are\nconducted to study the accuracy of the EFD. It is shown that the EFD can yield\naccurate and consistent decomposition results for signals with multiple\nnon-stationary modes and those with closely-spaced modes, compared with\ndecomposition results by the EWT, FDM, variational mode decomposition and\nempirical mode decomposition.

Manifold\nlearning typically includes the spectral analysis of a kernel built from the\nmeasurements. Here, we take a different approach, utilizing the Riemannian\ngeometry of the kernels. In particular, we study the way the spectrum of the\nkernels changes along geodesic paths on the manifold of SPD matrices. We show\nthat this change enables us, in a purely unsupervised manner, to derive a\ncompact, yet informative, description of the relations between the\nmeasurements, in terms of their underlying components. Based on this result, we\npresent new algorithms for extracting the common latent components and for\nidentifying common and measurement-specific components.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2020 04:38:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Feb 2022 09:33:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-03"}

The curator model allows greater accuracy but requires a trusted\nanalyzer. In the local model where users randomize local data before sending\nthem to the analyzer, a trusted analyzer is not required but the accuracy is\nlimited. In this work, by leveraging the \\textit{privacy amplification} effect\nin the recently proposed shuffle model of differential privacy, we achieve the\nbest of two worlds, i.e., accuracy in the curator model and strong privacy\nwithout relying on any trusted party.

If the dimensionality\nof the random parameters is low, these methods provide orders of magnitude\nacceleration over Monte Carlo sampling. We construct a generalized polynomial\nchaos based methodology for optimizing smooth functions in the presence of\nrandom parameters that are drawn from \\emph{known} distributions.

Accordingly, in this paper, we study\nPEH effects in Milky Way-like galaxies using smoothed particle hydrodynamics\n(SPH) code which self-consistently implements the evolution of the gas, dust,\nand interstellar radiation field (ISRF). Dust evolution includes dust formation\nby stars, destruction by SNe, and growth in dense media. We find that PEH\nsuppresses star formation due to the excess heating that reduces the ISM\ndensity. This suppression is seen across the entire range of gas fractions,\nstar formation recipes, dust models, and PEH efficiencies investigated by our\ncode. The suppression ranges from negligible values to approximately a factor\nof five depending on the specific implementation. Galaxy models having higher\ngas fraction experience higher star formation suppression. The adopted dust\nmodel also alters the extent of star formation suppression. Moreover, when PEH\nis switched on, galaxy models show higher gas outflow rates and have higher\nloading factors indicative of enhanced SNe feedback. In gas-rich models (i.e. a\ngas fraction of 0.5), we also find that PEH suppresses the formation of disk\nclumps via violent disk instabilities, and thus suppresses bulge formation via\nclumps migration to the central regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2020 05:27:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-18"}

While signal\nquantization provides many physical advantages, it usually degrades the\nsubsequent estimation performance that is based on quantized data. In order to\nmaintain physical constraints and simultaneously bring substantial performance\ngain, in this work we consider systems with mixed-resolution, 1-bit quantized\nand continuous-valued, data. First, we describe the linear minimum mean-squared\nerror (LMMSE) estimator and its associated mean-squared error (MSE) for the\ngeneral mixed-resolution model. However, the MSE of the LMMSE requires matrix\ninversion in which the number of measurements defines the matrix dimensions and\nthus, is not a tractable tool for optimization and system design. Therefore, we\npresent the linear Gaussian orthonormal (LGO) measurement model and derive a\nclosed-form analytic expression for the MSE of the LMMSE estimator under this\nmodel. In addition, we present two common special cases of the LGO model: 1)\nscalar parameter estimation and 2) channel estimation in mixed-ADC\nmultiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems. We then solve the\nresource allocation optimization problem of the LGO model with the proposed\ntractable form of the MSE as an objective function and under a power constraint\nusing a one-dimensional search.

Specifically, we\nfirstly perform lexicon induction with unsupervised word embedding mapping\nbetween the source and target languages, and then randomly replace some words\nin the input sentence with their translation words according to the extracted\ntranslation lexicons. CSP adopts the encoder-decoder framework: its encoder\ntakes the code-mixed sentence as input, and its decoder predicts the replaced\nfragment of the input sentence. In this way, CSP is able to pre-train the NMT\nmodel by explicitly making the most of the cross-lingual alignment information\nextracted from the source and target monolingual corpus.

The free surface of the flow as well\nas the interface among the fluids are contaminated by insoluble surfactants.\nDynamics of both the layers are governed by the Navier--Stokes equations, and\nthe surfactant transport equation regulates the motion of the insoluble\nsurfactants at the interface and free surface. Instability mechanisms are\ncompared by imposing the external shear along and opposite to the flow\ndirection. A coupled Orr--Sommerfeld system of equations for the considered\nproblem is derived using the perturbation technique and normal mode analysis.\nThe eigenmodes corresponding to the Orr--Sommerfeld eigenvalue problem are\nobtained by employing the spectral collocation method. The numerical results\nimply that the stronger external shear destabilizes the interface mode\ninstability. However, a stabilizing impact of the external shear on the surface\nmode is noticed if the shear is imposed in the flow direction, which is in\ncontrast to the role of imposed external shear on the surface mode for a\nsurfactant laden single layer falling film. Moreover, the impression of shear\nmode on the primary instability is analyzed in the high Reynolds number regime\nwith sufficiently low inclination angle. Under such configuration, dominance of\nthe shear mode over the surface mode is observed due to the weaker impact of\nthe gravitation force on the surface instability. The shear mode can also be\nstabilized by applying the external shear in the counter direction of the\nstreamwise flow. Conclusively, the extra imposed shear on the stratified\ntwo-layer falling film plays an active role to control the attitude of the\ninstabilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2020 07:34:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-02"}

We evaluate the effect of\ntemperature, strain rate, crack-length and point-defect concentration on the\nstrength and elastic properties. Tensile strength goes through significant\ndegradation with the increment of temperature, crack length and defect\npercentage. Elastic modulus is less susceptible to temperature variation but is\nlargely affected by the defect concentration. Strain rate induces a power law\nrelation between strength and fracture strain. Finally, we discuss the fracture\nmechanisms in the light of crack propagation and establish the links between\nthe fracture mechanism and the observed anisotropic properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2020 07:41:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-18"}

Our\nnumerical calculations yield rich phase diagrams with distinct high-field\nphases above the Pauli limiting field. For perfectly nested commensurate CDWs,\na $q$-modulated CDW phase that is completely analogous to the superconducting\nFulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) phase appears at high-fields. In the\nmore common case of imperfect nesting, the commensurate CDW groundstate\nundergoes a series of magnetic-field-induced phase transitions first into a\nphase where commensurate CDW and SDW coexist and subsequently into another\nphase where CDW and SDW acquire a $q$-modulation that is however distinct from\nthe pure FFLO CDW phase. The commensurate CDW+SDW phase occurs for fields\ncomparable to but less than the Pauli limit and survives above it. Thus this\nphase provides a plausible mechanism for the CDW to survive at high fields\nwithout the need of forming the more fragile FFLO phase. We suggest that the\nrecently discovered 2D materials like the transition metal dichalcogenides\noffer a promising platform for observing such exotic field induced CDW\nphenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2020 07:54:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-18"}

We model this problem as a Partially\nObservable Markov Decision Process solved by a Monte-Carlo planning approach.\nThis allows us to make decisions on the next moves by iterating over the known\nscenario at hand, exploring the environment and searching for the object at the\nsame time. Differently from the current state of the art in Reinforcement\nLearning, POMP does not require extensive and expensive (in time and\ncomputation) labelled data so being very agile in solving AVS in small and\nmedium real scenarios.

Such robust attachment to rough and irregular\nsurfaces enables manipulation of a broad range of real-world objects, such as\nan egg, lime, and foiled package, without any physical damage. Compared to the\nconventional suction cup designs, the proposed suction gripper design shows a\nfour-fold increase in gripping performance on rough surfaces. Furthermore, the\nstructural and material simplicity of the proposed gripper architecture\nfacilitates its system-level integration with other soft robotic peripherals,\nwhich can enable broader impact in diverse fields, such as digital\nmanufacturing, robotic manipulation, and medical gripping applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2020 09:05:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-19"}

As a result, rIGA enriches the approximation space and decreases the\ninterconnection between degrees of freedom. We compare computational costs of\nrIGA versus those of IGA when employing a Lanczos eigensolver with a\nshift-and-invert spectral transformation.

Let $p$ be the polynomial\ndegree of basis functions and assume that IGA has maximum continuity of\n${p-1}$, while rIGA introduces $C^0$ separators to minimize the factorization\ncost.

After\nrepeating the procedure n times, we obtain a grammar of order 0, whose\nnonemptiness can be easily checked. Since the size grows exponentially at each\nstep, the overall complexity is n-EXPTIME, which is known to be optimal. More\nprecisely, the transformation (and hence the whole algorithm) is linear in the\nsize of the grammar, assuming that the arity of employed nonterminals is\nbounded by a constant.

As a\nresult, in many crystals, e.g., bulk silicon, the temperature-dependent thermal\nconductivity shows the classical 1/T relationship because of the dominant\nUmklapp phonon-phonon scattering in the systems. However, the thermal\nconductivity of many crystalline metal-organic frameworks is very low and shows\nno, a weakly negative and even a weakly positive temperature dependence\n(glass-like thermal conductivity). It has been in debate whether the thermal\ntransport can be still described by phonons in metal-organic frameworks.

Integration into a cavity can boost both values via the Purcell\neffect, but poor optical coherence of near-surface NV centers has so far\nprevented their resonant optical control, as would be required for entanglement\ngeneration.

The tracking error term penalizes the distance between the\nallocation controls and a reference portfolio with same wealth and fixed\nweights. Such consideration is motivated as follows: (i) On the one hand, it is\na way to robustify the mean-variance allocation in case of misspecified\nparameters, by \"fitting\" it to a reference portfolio that can be agnostic to\nmarket parameters; (ii) On the other hand, it is a procedure to track a\nbenchmark and improve the Sharpe ratio of the resulting portfolio by\nconsidering a mean-variance criterion in the objective function. This problem\nis formulated as a McKean-Vlasov control problem. We provide explicit solutions\nfor the optimal portfolio strategy and asymptotic expansions of the portfolio\nstrategy and efficient frontier for small values of the tracking error\nparameter. Finally, we compare the Sharpe ratios obtained by the standard\nmean-variance allocation and the penalized one for four different reference\nportfolios: equal-weights, minimum-variance, equal risk contributions and\nshrinking portfolio. This comparison is done on a simulated misspecified model,\nand on a backtest performed with historical data.

Among three potential candidates, originated from\ndifferent components of $R_{ab}$ along the null vectors for the surface (i.e.\n$R_{ab}q^a_cl^b$, $R_{ab}l^al^b$ and $R_{ab}l^ak^b$ where $q_{ab}$ is the\nprojector on the null surface and $l^a$, $k^a$ are null normal and\ncorresponding auxiliary vector of it, respectively), the first one leads to\nNavier-Stokes like equation. Here we devote our investigation on the other two\nmembers. We find that $R_{ab}l^al^b$, which yields the evolution equation for\nexpansion parameter corresponding to $l^a$ along itself, can be interpreted as\na thermodynamic relation when integrated on the two dimensional transverse\nsubspace of the null hypersurface along with a virtual displacement in the\ndirection of $l^a$. Moreover for a stationary background the integrated version\nof it yields the general form of Smarr formula. Although this is more or less\nknown in literature, but a similar argument for the evolution equation of the\nexpansion parameter corresponding to $k^a$ along $l^a$, provided by\n$R_{ab}l^ak^b$, leads to a more convenient form of thermodynamic relation. In\nthis analysis, contrary to earlier approaches, the identified thermodynamic\nentities come out to be in covariant forms and also are foliation independent.\nHence these can be applied to any coordinate system adapted to the null\nhypersurface. Moreover, these results are not restricted to any specific\nparametrisation of $k^a$ and also $k^a$ need not be hypersurface orthogonal. In\naddition, here any particular dynamical equation for metric is not being\nexplicitly used and therefore we feel that our results are solely based on the\nproperties of the null surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2020 11:50:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2020 03:01:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-29"}

For the water-splitting reaction to happen on TiO$_2$-terminated\nsurfaces, it is necessary to have two neighboring O-vacancies acting as active\nsites that host two adsorbing water molecules. However, eventual dissociation\nof O-H bonds is possible only in the presence of an additional nearest-neighbor\nO-vacancy. Unfortunately, this necessary third vacancy inhibits the formation\nof molecular hydrogen by trapping the dissociated H atoms over\nTiO$_2$-teminated surfaces. Formation of up to 3 O-vacancies, is energetically\nless costly on both terminations of PbTiO$_3$ (001) surfaces compared with that\nof TiO$_2$, the presence of Pb leads to weaker O bonds over these surfaces.\nMolecular hydrogen formation is more favorable over the PbO-terminated surface\nof PbTiO$_3$, requiring only two neighboring oxygen vacancies. However,\nhydrogen molecule is retained near the surface by weak van der Waals forces.\nOur study indicates two barriers leading to low productivity of direct water\nsplitting processes. First and foremost, there is an entropic barrier imposed\nby the requirement of at least two nearest-neighbor O-vacancies, sterically\nhindering the process.

A novel scheme to extract impedances from CAD\ndevice models, suitable for a finite element implementation, is derived from\nMaxwell's equations in differential form. It provides a foundation for\nparasitic extraction across a broad frequency range and is able to handle\ninhomogeneous permittivities and permeabilities, making it more flexible than\nexisting integral equation approaches. The approach allows for the automatic\ntreatment of multi-port models of arbitrary conductor geometry without\nrequiring any significant manual user interaction. This is achieved by\ncomputing a connecting source current density that supplies current to the\nmodel's terminals, whatever their location in the model, subsequently using\nthis current density to compute the electric field, and finally calculating the\nimpedance via a scalar potential. A mandatory low-frequency stabilization\nscheme is outlined, ensuring a stable evaluation of the model at low\nfrequencies as well. Two quasistatic approximations and the special case of\nperfect electric conductors are treated theoretically. The magnetoquasistatic\napproximation is validated against an analytical model in a numerical\nexperiment.

A modified version of the discrete bacterial\nforaging optimization algorithm (DBFOA) is introduced as the optimization\ntechnique to minimize the overall voltage unbalance of the network as the\nobjective function, subjected to various network and operating parameters. The\nimpact of utilizing the proposed PV re-phasing technique as opposed to a fixed\nphase configuration are compared based on overall voltage unbalance, which was\nobserved hourly throughout the day. The case studies show that the proposed\napproach can significantly mitigate the overall voltage unbalance during the\ndaytime and can facilitate to increase the usable PV capacity of the considered\nnetwork by 77%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2020 13:02:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-08"}

Further, using a shell model calculation of the nuclear\nstructure contribution to the shape factor, we find a strong disagreement with\nthe allowed shape factor and discuss several sources of uncertainty. In the\n1-200 keV window, the predicted flux is up to 20$\\%$ lower. Finally, we discuss\nomissions and detector effects in previously used QED radiative corrections,\nand find small changes in the slope at the $\\gtrsim 1\\%$ MeV$^{-1}$ level, up\nto $3\\%$ in magnitude due to omissions in $\\mathcal{O}(Z\\alpha^2, Z^2\\alpha^3)$\ncorrections and $3.5\\%$ uncertainty from the neglect of as of yet unavailable\nhigher-order contributions. Combined, these give rise to an increase of at\nleast a factor 2 of the uncertainty in the 1-200 keV window. We comment on\npossible experimental schemes of measuring this and related transitions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2020 13:54:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-18"}

As a\nsolution, coded computation has been recently proposed to efficiently add\nredundancy to the computation tasks. In this technique, coding is used across\ndata sets, and computation is done over coded data, such that the results of an\narbitrary subset of worker nodes with a certain size are enough to recover the\nfinal results. The major challenges with those approaches are (1) they are\nlimited to polynomial function computations, (2) the size of the subset of\nservers that we need to wait for grows with the multiplication of the size of\nthe data set and the model complexity (the degree of the polynomial), which can\nbe prohibitively large, (3) they are not numerically stable for computation\nover real numbers.

In general, AICc modelling is thought to overfit (too many model\nparameters) and BIC underfits. For spectroscopic modelling, both AICc and BIC\nlack in two important respects: (a) no penalty distinction is made according to\nline strength such that parameters of weak lines close to the detection\nthreshold are treated with equal importance as strong lines and (b) no account\nis taken of the way in which spectral lines impact on narrow data regions. In\nthis paper we introduce a new information criterion that addresses these\nshortcomings, the \"Spectral Information Criterion\" (SpIC). Spectral simulations\nare used to compare performances. The main findings are (i) SpIC clearly\noutperforms AICc for high signal to noise data, (ii) SpIC and AICc work equally\nwell for lower signal to noise data, although SpIC achieves this with fewer\nparameters, and (iii) BIC does not perform well (for this application) and\nshould be avoided.

These enzymes operate by toggling between an active (\"ON\")\nguanosine triphosphate (GTP)-bound state and an inactive (\"OFF\") guanosine\ndiphosphate (GDP)-bound state; such a toggle is regulated by GEFs (guanine\nnucleotide exchange factors) and GAPs (GTPase activating proteins). Here we\ndissect a network motif between monomeric (m) and trimeric (t) GTPases\nassembled exclusively in eukaryotic cells of multicellular organisms. To this\nend, we develop a system of ordinary differential equations in which these two\nclasses of GTPases are interlinked conditional to their ON/OFF states within a\nmotif through feedforward and feedback loops. We provide formulas for the\nsteady states of the system and perform local stability analysis to investigate\nthe role of the different connections between the GTPase switches. A\nfeedforward from the active mGTPase to the GEF of the tGTPase was sufficient to\nprovide two locally stable states: one where both active/inactive forms of the\nmGTPase can be interpreted as having low concentrations and the other where\nboth m- and tGTPase have high concentrations. When a feedback loop from the GEF\nof the tGTPase to the GAP of the mGTPase was added to the feedforward system,\ntwo other locally stable states emerged, both having the tGTPase inactivated\nand being interpreted as having low active tGTPase concentrations. Finally, the\naddition of a second feedback loop, from the active tGTPase to the GAP of the\nmGTPase, gives rise to a family of steady states parametrized by the inactive\ntGTPase concentrations. Our findings reveal that the coupling of these two\ndifferent GTPase motifs can dramatically change their steady state behaviors\nand shed light on how such coupling may impact information processing in\neukaryotic cells.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2020 15:09:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-18"}

Saliency\nmodels have been useful to predict fixation locations in natural images, but\nare static, i.e., they provide no information about the time-sequence of\nfixations. Nowadays, one of the biggest challenges in the field is to go beyond\nsaliency maps to predict a sequence of fixations related to a visual task, such\nas searching for a given target. Bayesian observer models have been proposed\nfor this task, as they represent visual search as an active sampling process.\nNevertheless, they were mostly evaluated on artificial images, and how they\nadapt to natural images remains largely unexplored.\n  Here, we propose a unified Bayesian model for visual search guided by\nsaliency maps as prior information.

This process of \"star formation\nquenching\" has been related to various causes, including Active Galactic Nuclei\n(AGN) activity, the influence of large-scale dynamics, and the environment in\nwhich galaxies live. In this paper, we present the first results from a\nfollow-up of CALIFA survey galaxies with observations of molecular gas obtained\nwith the APEX telescope. Together with EDGE survey CARMA observations, we\ncollect $^{12}$CO observations that cover approximately one effective radius in\n472 CALIFA galaxies. We observe that the deficit of galaxy star formation with\nrespect to the star formation main sequence (SFMS) increases with the absence\nof molecular gas and with a reduced efficiency of conversion of molecular gas\ninto stars, in line with results of other integrated studies. However, by\ndividing the sample into galaxies dominated by star formation and galaxies\nquenched in their centres (as indicated by the average value of the H$\\alpha$\nequivalent width), we find that this deficit increases sharply once a certain\nlevel of gas consumption is reached, indicating that different mechanisms drive\nseparation from the SFMS in star-forming and quenched galaxies. Our results\nindicate that differences in the amount of molecular gas at a fixed stellar\nmass are the primary driver for the dispersion in the SFMS, and the most likely\nexplanation for the start of star-formation quenching. However, once a galaxy\nis quenched, changes in star formation efficiency drive how much a retired\ngalaxy separates in star formation rate from star-forming ones of similar\nmasses. In other words, once a paucity of molecular gas has significantly\nreduced star formation, changes in the star formation efficiency are what\ndrives a galaxy deeper into the red cloud, retiring it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2020 15:57:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-04"}

Traditional and ubiquitous\nresponse formats such as Likert and Visual Analogue Scales require condensation\nof responses into discrete point values - but sometimes a range of options may\nbetter represent the correct answer. In this paper, we propose an efficient\ninterval-valued response mode, whereby responses are made by marking an ellipse\nalong a continuous scale. We discuss its potential to capture and quantify\nvaluable information that would be lost using conventional approaches, while\npreserving a high degree of response-efficiency. The information captured by\nthe response interval may represent a possible response range - i.e., a\nconjunctive set, such as the real numbers between three and six. Alternatively,\nit may reflect uncertainty in respect to a distinct response - i.e., a\ndisjunctive set, such as a confidence interval. We then report a validation\nstudy, utilizing our recently introduced open-source software (DECSYS) to\nexplore how interval-valued survey responses reflect experimental manipulations\nof several factors hypothesised to influence interval width, across multiple\ncontexts. Results consistently indicate that respondents used interval widths\neffectively, and subjective participant feedback was also positive.

They are cheap and easy to\nfabricate. However, up to now, they possess fundamental drawback: low\neffectiveness. In the most popular BHJ (bulk heterojunction) architecture the\nactual long-standing top efficiency is about 12\\% (recent achievements about\n15\\%). One ask the question how fundamental this limitation is, as certain\ntheoretical considerations suggest that it should be about two times higher. In\nour paper we analyze the `geometric factor' as one of possible explanation of\nrelatively low efficiency of BHJ architecture. More precisly, we calculate the\neffective area of the donor-acceptor border in the random mixture of donor and\nacceptor nanocrystals and further compare it with an ideal 'brush'\narchitecture. In our previous calculation for the two dimensional model, we\nhave found that the maximal value of geometric factor was about 40\\%. In the\nactual three dimensional model, it turned out that both architectures give very\nclose value of the effective area. So the geometric factor seems to be not\nsignificant as a factor limiting efficiency. Implications of this fact are\ndiscussed: we list two other factors (mentioned but not thoroughly discussed in\nliterature) which can be responsible for limitations of efficiency of BHJ\narchitecture. We estimate their scale, and suggest that these limitations are\ninevitable, or at least very hard to overcome.

An optimal configuration\nwas found where the upstream trackers should be located 6 cm away from the\ntarget and spaced 4 cm apart whereas their spatial resolutions should be close\nto 100 $\\mu$m. The positions of the downstream trackers will have to be changed\naccording to the beam energy to preserve high identification efficiencies.\nTheir spatial resolutions, even though of a lesser importance compared to the\nupstream trackers, should be around 1 mm or better. In this optimal\nconfiguration, an overall fragment identification efficiency above 90% has been\nobtained for beam energies ranging from 100 to 400 MeV/nucleon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2020 08:53:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2020 17:27:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-24"}

Reservoir computing is understood in the literature as the\npossibility of approximating input/output systems with randomly chosen\nrecurrent neural systems and a trained linear readout layer. Light is shed on\nthis phenomenon by constructing what is called strongly universal reservoir\nsystems as random projections of a family of state-space systems that generate\nVolterra series expansions. This procedure yields a state-affine reservoir\nsystem with randomly generated coefficients in a dimension that is\nlogarithmically reduced with respect to the original system. This reservoir\nsystem is able to approximate any element in the fading memory filters class\njust by training a different linear readout for each different filter. Explicit\nexpressions for the probability distributions needed in the generation of the\nprojected reservoir system are stated and bounds for the committed\napproximation error are provided.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2020 10:55:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-29"}

It\naims to confirm and discuss the limits of considering a single value of\nNi$\\times$t to describe aerosol charging and then to present methods to control\nthe size-charge relation. Three aerosol chargers, with different mixings of ion\nand aerosol flows are investigated. Despite comparable ion sources with\ndischarge currents of a few tens of $\\mu$A, the size-charge relations differs\nfrom one charger to another due to different ion-aerosol mixing conditions and\nsubsequent ion density along particles trajectories. Discrepancies are even\nmore noticeable as the particle size increases. Discharge current, velocities\nof ion and aerosol flows and electric field control post-discharge ion density\nin each point of the charging volume. The control of particle trajectory in\nexpanding unipolar ion cloud, leads to tuneable size-charge relations. Aerosol\ninertia and charging dynamics, that both depends on particle size, affects the\nNi$\\times$t experienced by the particle and thus the final charge of the\nparticle. Operating conditions to reach a constant mean charge for particles\nlarger than 200 nm are reported. Conclusions provide a basis to design aerosol\nchargers devoted to electric mobility selection for aerosol deposition,\nseparation or electrical measurements especially to overcome the limits of\nmobility-to-size data inversion due to multiple charge ambiguity using\ndiffusion chargers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2020 09:30:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-03"}
