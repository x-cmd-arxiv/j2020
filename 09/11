Pre-training based meta-learning methods\neffectively tackle the problem by pre-training a feature extractor and then\nfine-tuning it through the nearest centroid based meta-learning. However,\nresults show that the fine-tuning step makes very marginal improvements. In\nthis paper, 1) we figure out the key reason, i.e., in the pre-trained feature\nspace, the base classes already form compact clusters while novel classes\nspread as groups with large variances, which implies that fine-tuning the\nfeature extractor is less meaningful; 2) instead of fine-tuning the feature\nextractor, we focus on estimating more representative prototypes during\nmeta-learning. Consequently, we propose a novel prototype completion based\nmeta-learning framework. This framework first introduces primitive knowledge\n(i.e., class-level part or attribute annotations) and extracts representative\nattribute features as priors. Then, we design a prototype completion network to\nlearn to complete prototypes with these priors. To avoid the prototype\ncompletion error caused by primitive knowledge noises or class differences, we\nfurther develop a Gaussian based prototype fusion strategy that combines the\nmean-based and completed prototypes by exploiting the unlabeled samples.\nExtensive experiments show that our method: (i) can obtain more accurate\nprototypes; (ii) outperforms state-of-the-art techniques by 2% - 9% in terms of\nclassification accuracy.

It highlights the central role of self-consistency.\nThis leads to a mathematical framework in which the classical and quantum\nworlds are naturally entangled. We build a Poisson bracket for the polynomial\nfunctions on the hermitian weak$^{\\ast }$ continuous functionals on any\n$C^{\\ast }$-algebra. This is reminiscent of a well-known construction for\nfinite-dimensional Lie algebras. We then restrict this Poisson bracket to\nstates of this $C^{\\ast }$-algebra, by taking quotients with respect to Poisson\nideals. This leads to densely defined symmetric derivations on the commutative\n$C^{\\ast }$-algebras of real-valued functions on the set of states. Up to a\nclosure, these are proven to generate $C_{0}$-groups of contractions. As a\nmatter of fact, in general commutative $C^{\\ast }$-algebras, even the\nclosableness of unbounded symmetric derivations is a non-trivial issue.

First, we present a dynamic-graph based SEIR epidemiological model in\norder to describe the dynamics of the disease propagation. Our model considers\na dynamic network that accounts for the interactions between individuals over\ntime, such as the ones obtained by manual or automated contact tracing, and\nuses a diffusion-reaction mechanism to describe the state dynamics. This\ndynamic graph model helps identify likely exposed/infected individuals to whom\nwe can provide early warnings, even before they display any symptoms and/or are\nasymptomatic. Moreover, when the testing capacity is limited compared to the\npopulation size, reliable estimation of individual's health state and disease\ntransmissibility using epidemiological models is extremely challenging. Thus,\nestimation of state uncertainty is paramount for both eminent risk assessment,\nas well as for closing the tracing-testing loop by optimal testing\nprescription. Therefore, we propose the use of arbitrary Polynomial Chaos\nExpansion, a popular technique used for uncertainty quantification, to\nrepresent the states, and quantify the uncertainties in the dynamic model. This\ndesign enables us to assign uncertainty of the state of each individual, and\nconsequently optimize the testing as to reduce the overall uncertainty given a\nconstrained testing budget.

The problem of sparsifying a graph while\napproximately preserving its cut structure has been extensively studied and has\nmany applications. In a seminal work, Bencz\\'ur and Karger (1996) showed that\ngiven any $n$-vertex undirected weighted graph $G$ and a parameter $\\varepsilon\n\\in (0,1)$, there is a near-linear time algorithm that outputs a weighted\nsubgraph $G'$ of $G$ of size $\\tilde{O}(n/\\varepsilon^2)$ such that the weight\nof every cut in $G$ is preserved to within a $(1 \\pm \\varepsilon)$-factor in\n$G'$. The graph $G'$ is referred to as a {\\em $(1 \\pm \\varepsilon)$-approximate\ncut sparsifier} of $G$.\n  A natural question is if such cut-preserving sparsifiers also exist for\nhypergraphs.

It has been an open question whether or not\nBencz\\'ur-Karger bound is achievable on hypergraphs.

However, the circuit depth is expected to grow significantly with\nproblem size. Increased depth can both degrade the accuracy of the results and\nreduce trainability. In this work, we propose a novel approach to reduce ansatz\ncircuit depth. Our approach, called PermVQE, adds an additional optimization\nloop to VQE that permutes qubits in order to solve for the qubit Hamiltonian\nthat minimizes long-range correlations in the ground state. The choice of\npermutations is based on mutual information, which is a measure of interaction\nbetween electrons in spin-orbitals. Encoding strongly interacting spin-orbitals\ninto proximal qubits on a quantum chip naturally reduces the circuit depth\nneeded to prepare the ground state. For representative molecular systems, LiH,\nH$_2$, (H$_2$)$_2$, H$_4$, and H$_3^+$, we demonstrate for linear qubit\nconnectivity that placing entangled qubits in close proximity leads to\nshallower depth circuits required to reach a given eigenvalue-eigenvector\naccuracy. This approach can be extended to any qubit connectivity and can\nsignificantly reduce the depth required to reach a desired accuracy in VQE.\nMoreover, our approach can be applied to other variational quantum algorithms\nbeyond VQE.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2020 17:07:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-16"}

In this\ncontribution, we study how such features can help in improving the quality of\nthe solutions returned by the annealer.

Reverse annealing (RA) was designed to\nallow refining a known solution by backward annealing from a classical state\nrepresenting the solution to a mid-anneal point where a transverse field is\npresent, followed by an ordinary forward anneal, which is hoped to improve on\nthe previous solution. The h-gain (HG) feature stands for time-dependent gain\nin Hamiltonian linear ($h$) biases and was originally developed to help study\nfreezeout times and phase transitions in spin glasses. Here we apply HG to bias\nthe quantum state in the beginning of the annealing process towards the known\nsolution as in the RA case, but using a different apparatus.

To determine the impact of pruning a group of\nfilters on a network's accuracy, state-of-the-art pruning methods consistently\nassume filters of a CNN are independent. This allows the importance of a group\nof filters to be estimated as the sum of importances of individual filters.\nHowever, overparameterization in modern networks results in highly correlated\nfilters that invalidate this assumption, thereby resulting in incorrect\nimportance estimates. To address this issue, we propose OrthoReg, a principled\nregularization strategy that enforces orthonormality on a network's filters to\nreduce inter-filter correlation, thereby allowing reliable, efficient\ndetermination of group importance estimates, improved trainability of pruned\nnetworks, and efficient, simultaneous pruning of large groups of filters. When\nused for iterative pruning on VGG-13, MobileNet-V1, and ResNet-34, OrthoReg\nconsistently outperforms five baseline techniques, including the\nstate-of-the-art, on CIFAR-100 and Tiny-ImageNet. For the recently proposed\nEarly-Bird Ticket hypothesis, which claims networks become amenable to pruning\nearly-on in training and can be pruned after a few epochs to minimize training\nexpenditure, we find OrthoReg significantly outperforms prior work.

When the\nsystem-level objective is submodular maximization, it is known that if every\nagent can observe the action choice of all other agents, then all Nash\nequilibria of a large class of resulting games are within a factor of $2$ of\noptimal; that is, the price of anarchy is $1/2$. However, little is known if\nagents cannot observe the action choices of other relevant agents. To study\nthis, we extend the standard game-theoretic model to one in which a subset of\nagents either become \\emph{blind} (unable to observe others' choices) or\n\\emph{isolated} (blind, and also invisible to other agents), and we prove exact\nexpressions for the price of anarchy as a function of the number of compromised\nagents. When $k$ agents are compromised (in any combination of blind or\nisolated), we show that the price of anarchy for a large class of utility\nfunctions is exactly $1/(2+k)$. We then show that if agents use marginal-cost\nutility functions and at least $1$ of the compromised agents is blind (rather\nthan isolated), the price of anarchy improves to $1/(1+k)$.

It has become a new norm to utilize CLM provided word embeddings in\ndownstream tasks such as text classification. However, unless addressed, CLMs\nare prone to learn intrinsic gender-bias in the dataset. As a result,\npredictions of downstream NLP models can vary noticeably by varying gender\nwords, such as replacing \"he\" to \"she\", or even gender-neutral words. In this\npaper, we focus our analysis on a popular CLM, i.e., BERT. We analyse the\ngender-bias it induces in five downstream tasks related to emotion and\nsentiment intensity prediction. For each task, we train a simple regressor\nutilizing BERT's word embeddings. We then evaluate the gender-bias in\nregressors using an equity evaluation corpus. Ideally and from the specific\ndesign, the models should discard gender informative features from the input.\nHowever, the results show a significant dependence of the system's predictions\non gender-particular words and phrases. We claim that such biases can be\nreduced by removing genderspecific features from word embedding. Hence, for\neach layer in BERT, we identify directions that primarily encode gender\ninformation. The space formed by such directions is referred to as the gender\nsubspace in the semantic space of word embeddings. We propose an algorithm that\nfinds fine-grained gender directions, i.e., one primary direction for each BERT\nlayer. This obviates the need of realizing gender subspace in multiple\ndimensions and prevents other crucial information from being omitted.\nExperiments show that removing embedding components in such directions achieves\ngreat success in reducing BERT-induced bias in the downstream tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2020 17:38:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-11"}

The dipolar and quadrupolar correlations evolve over\nthree distinct regimes that we characterize via heat capacity, elastic and\ninelastic neutron scattering. In the first regime, above $T^*=1.1$ K,\nsignificant quadrupolar correlations lead to an intense inelastic mode that\ncannot be accounted for within a scenario with solely magnetic dipole-dipole\ncorrelations. The onset of extended dipole correlations occurs in the\nintermediate regime, between $T^*=1.1$ K and $T_c = 0.25$ K, with the formation\nof a collective paramagnetic state characterized by extended ferromagnetic\ncanted spin ice domains. Here, long-range order is impeded not only by the\nusual frustration operating in classical spin ice systems, but also by a\ncompetition between dipolar and quadrupolar correlations. Finally, in the\nlowest temperature regime, below $T_c=0.25$ K, there is an abrupt and\nsignificant increase in the dipole ordered moment. The majority of the ordered\nmoment remains tied up in the ferromagnetic spin ice-like state, but an\nadditional $\\mathbf{k}=(0,0,1)$ antiferromagnetic order parameter also\ndevelops. Simultaneously, the spectral weight of the inelastic mode, which is a\nproxy for the quadrupolar correlations, is observed to drop, indicating that\ndipole order ultimately wins out.

It is\ncomprised of three orthogonal nested solenoids with a ferromagnetic core at the\ncenter. Electrical current within the solenoids leads to Joule heating,\nresulting in undesired temperature increase within the Omnimagnet. If the\ntemperature exceeds the melting point of the wire insulation, device failure\nwill occur. Thus, a study of heat transfer within an Omnimagnet is a necessity,\nparticularly to maximize the performance of the device. For the first time, a\ntransient heat transfer model, that incorporates all three heat transfer modes,\nis proposed and validated with experimental data for an Omnimagnet with maximum\nroot mean square error equal to 8${\\%}$ (4$^{\\circ}$C). This transient model is\nnot computationally expensive. It is relatively easy to apply to Omnimagnets\nwith different structures. The accuracy of this model depends on the accuracy\nof the input data. The code is applied to calculate the maximum safe\noperational time at a fixed input current or the maximum safe input current for\na fixed time interval. The maximum safe operational time and maximum safe input\ncurrent depend on size and structure of the Omnimagnet and the lowest melting\npoint of all the Omnimagnet materials. A parametric study shows that increasing\nconvective heat transfer during cooling, and during heating with low input\ncurrents, is an effective method to increase the maximum operational time of\nthe Omnimagnet.The thermal model is also presented in a state-space equation\nformat that can be used in a real-time Kalman filter current controller to\navoid device failure due to excessive heating.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2020 18:21:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-22"}

In the\ngeneral case for non-trivial network topologies, however, the cost function\napproaches the XY Hamiltonian only in the strong pump limit. We show that by\nadiabatically tuning the pump parameter, the network can largely avoid trapping\ninto the local minima of the governing cost function and stabilize into the\nground state of the associated XY Hamiltonian. These results show the great\npotential of laser networks for unconventional computing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2020 18:51:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-04"}

In this work, we address this problem using an abstaining\nclassifier that is tuned to have $>$95% accuracy, and then identify the\ndeterminants of abstention using LIME. Essentially, we are training our model\nto learn the attributes of pathology reports that are likely to lead to\nincorrect classifications, albeit at the cost of reduced sensitivity. We\ndemonstrate an abstaining classifier in a multitask setting for classifying\ncancer pathology reports from the NCI SEER cancer registries on six tasks of\ninterest. For these tasks, we reduce the classification error rate by factors\nof 2--5 by abstaining on 25--45% of the reports.

In such models,\nobserved variables $\\mathbf{X}$ are modelled using a latent variable\n$\\mathbf{U}$ that is assumed to be from $N(\\mathbf{0}, \\mathbf{I})$. Clustering\nof variables is introduced by imposing constraints on the entries of the factor\nloading matrix to be 0 and 1 that results in a block diagonal covariance\nmatrices. However, this approach is overly restrictive as off-diagonal elements\nin the blocks of the covariance matrices can only be 1 which can lead to\nunsatisfactory model fit on complex data.

While visible symmetries correspond to\nthose infinitesimal isometries of the Riemannian target space of the scalar\nfield map which preserve the scalar potential, Hessian symmetries have a much\ndeeper theory. The latter correspond to Hesse functions, defined as solutions\nof the so-called Hesse equation of the target space. By definition, a Hesse\nmanifold is a Riemannian manifold which admits nontrivial Hesse functions --\nnot to be confused with a Hessian manifold (the latter being a Riemannian\nmanifold whose metric is locally the Hessian of a function). All Hesse\n$n$-manifolds ${\\cal M}$ are non-compact and characterized by their index,\ndefined as the dimension of the space of Hesse functions, which carries a\nnatural symmetric bilinear pairing. The Hesse index is bounded from above by\n$n+1$ and, when the metric is complete, this bound is attained iff ${\\cal M}$\nis a Poincar\\'e ball, in which case the space of Hesse functions identifies\nwith $\\mathbb{R}^{1,n}$ through an isomorphism constructed from the Weierstrass\nmap.

One approach for avoiding curtailment of renewable\nenergies is to cover excess feed-in by demand response. As curtailment is often\na local phenomenon, in this work we determine the regional demand response\npotential for the 401 German administrative districts. The load regionalisation\nis based on weighting factors derived from population and employment\nstatistics, locations of industrial facilities, etc. Using periodic and\ntemperature-dependent load profiles and technology specific parameters, load\nshifting potentials were determined with a temporal resolution of 15 minutes.\nOur analysis yields that power-to-heat technologies provide the highest\npotentials, followed by residential appliances, commercial and industrial\nloads. For the considered 2030 scenario, power-to-gas and e-mobility also\ncontribute a significant potential. The cumulated load increase potential of\nall technologies ranges from $5 - 470~MW$ per administrative district. The\nmedian value is $25~MW$, which would suffice to avoid the curtailment of 8\nclassical wind turbines. Further, we calculated load shifting cost-potential\ncurves for each district. Industrial processes and power-to-heat in district\nheating have the lowest load shifting investment cost, due to the largest\ninstalled capacities per facility. We distinguished between different size\nclasses of the installed capacity of heat pumps, yielding $23\\%$ lower average\ninvestment cost for heat pump flexibilisation in the city of Berlin compared to\na rural district. The variable costs of most considered load shifting\ntechnologies remain under the average compensation costs for curtailment of\nrenewable energies of $110~\\text{\\euro{}}/MWh$.

To enable distributed\nbeamforming between separate wireless nodes, the oscillators in the\ntransceivers must operate at the same frequency, and their phases must be\nappropriately aligned to support phase-coherent beamsteering. Based on a\nspectrally-sparse waveform, a self-mixing circuit, and an adaptive control\nloop, we present a system capable of synchronizing the RF oscillators in\nseparate transceivers over distances of nearly 100 m. The approach is based on\na spectrally-sparse waveform for joint inter-node ranging and frequency\ntransfer. A frequency reference is modulated onto one signal of a two-tone\nwaveform transmitted by the primary node which is demodulated and used to lock\nthe oscillator of the secondary node. The secondary node retransmits the\ntwo-tone signal which the primary node uses for a high-accuracy range\nmeasurement. From this range, the phase of the two transceivers can be aligned\nto support beamforming.

Motivated by such fraudulent\nbehavior, we study the ranking problem of a platform that faces a mixture of\nreal and fake users who are indistinguishable from one another. We first show\nthat existing learning algorithms---that are optimal in the absence of fake\nusers---may converge to highly sub-optimal rankings under manipulation by fake\nusers. To overcome this deficiency, we develop efficient learning algorithms\nunder two informational environments: in the first setting, the platform is\naware of the number of fake users, and in the second setting, it is agnostic to\nthe number of fake users. For both these environments, we prove that our\nalgorithms converge to the optimal ranking, while being robust to the\naforementioned fraudulent behavior; we also present worst-case performance\nguarantees for our methods, and show that they significantly outperform\nexisting algorithms. At a high level, our work employs several novel approaches\nto guarantee robustness such as: (i) constructing product-ordering graphs that\nencode the pairwise relationships between products inferred from the customers'\nactions; and (ii) implementing multiple levels of learning with a judicious\namount of bi-directional cross-learning between levels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2020 20:26:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-14"}

Leaf classification is a computer-vision task performed\nfor the automated identification of plant species, a serious challenge due to\nvariations in leaf morphology, including its size, texture, shape, and\nvenation. Researchers have recently become more inclined toward deep\nlearning-based methods rather than conventional feature-based methods due to\nthe popularity and successful implementation of deep learning methods in image\nanalysis, object recognition, and speech recognition.\n  In this paper, to have an interpretable and reliable system, a botanist's\nbehavior is modeled in leaf identification by proposing a highly-efficient\nmethod of maximum behavioral resemblance developed through three deep\nlearning-based models.

Relying on\nthe presence of raised seams on the surface of the ball to create asymmetric\nflow, a knuckleball's trajectory has proven very challenging to predict\ncompared to other baseball pitches, such as fastballs or curveballs. Previous\nexperimental tracking of large numbers of knuckleballs has shown that they can\nmove in essentially any direction relative to what would be expected from a\ndrag-only trajectory. This has led to speculation that knuckleballs exhibit\nchaotic motion. Here we develop a relatively simple model of a knuckleball that\nincludes quadratic drag and lift from asymmetric flow which is taken from\nexperimental measurements of slowly rotating baseballs. Our models can indeed\nexhibit dynamical chaos as long In contrast, models that omit torques on the\nball in flight do not show chaotic behavior. Uncertainties in the phase space\nposition of the knuckleball are shown to grow by factors as large as $10^6$\nover the flight of the ball from the pitcher to home plate. We quantify the\nimpact of our model parameters on the chaos realized in our models,\nspecifically showing that maximum Lyapunov exponent is roughly proportional to\nthe square root of the effective lever arm of the torque, and also roughly\nproportional to the initial velocity of the pitch. We demonstrate the existence\nof bifurcations that can produce changes in the location of the ball when it\nreaches the plate of as much as 1.2 m for specific initial conditions similar\nto those used by professional knuckleball pitchers. As we introduce additional\ncomplexity in the form of more faithful representations of the empirical\nasymmetry force measurements, we find that a larger fraction of the possible\ninitial conditions result in dynamical chaos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2020 20:32:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-14"}

As the\nantisolvent isopropanol displaced the alanine solution pre-filled in a\nmicrochamber, liquid-liquid phase separation occurred at the mixing front. The\nalanine-rich subphase formed surface microdroplets that subsequently\ncrystallized with progression of solvent exchange.

When an incident\nblocking the lanes ahead is detected, Sentinel calculates the probability of\nleaving the blocked lane(s) before reaching the incident point at each time\nstep. It advises the vehicle to leave the blocked lane(s) when that probability\ndrops below a certain threshold, as the vehicle nears the congestion boundary.\nBy doing this, Sentinel reduces the number of late-stage lane changes of\nvehicles in the blocked lane(s) trying to move to other lanes, and distributes\nthose maneuvers upstream of the incident point. A simulation case study is\nconducted in which one lane of a four-lane section of the I-66 interstate\nhighway in the U.S. is temporarily blocked due to an incident, to understand\nhow Sentinel impacts traffic flow and how different parameters - traffic flow,\nsystem penetration rate, and incident duration - affect Sentinel's performance.\nThe results show that Sentinel has a positive impact on traffic flow, reducing\naverage delay by up to 37%, particularly when it has a considerable penetration\nrate.

Some metrics have been\nidentified to be robust against shifting and scaling of the data but\nconsidering the different distributions of data is much more difficult to\naddress (imbalance problem) even though it largely impacts the comparability\nbetween evaluations on different datasets. In classification, it has been\nstated repeatedly that performance metrics like the F-Measure and Accuracy are\nhighly dependent on the class distribution and that comparisons between\ndifferent datasets with different distributions are impossible. We show that\nthe same problem exists in regression. The distribution of odometry parameters\nin robotic applications can for example largely vary between different\nrecording sessions. Here, we need regression algorithms that either perform\nequally well for all function values, or that focus on certain boundary regions\nlike high speed. This has to be reflected in the evaluation metric. We propose\nthe modification of established regression metrics by weighting with the\ninverse distribution of function values $Y$ or the samples $X$ using an\nautomatically tuned Gaussian kernel density estimator. We show on synthetic and\nrobotic data in reproducible experiments that classical metrics behave wrongly,\nwhereas our new metrics are less sensitive to changing distributions,\nespecially when correcting by the marginal distribution in $X$.

First, we develop a rigorous solution\nconcept for the interacting particle system with annihilation. The main\ninnovation here is to provide a careful management of the annihilation of\ngroups of more than two particles, and we show that the definition is\nconsistent by proving existence, uniqueness, and continuous dependence on\ninitial data.

The ejecta regions are divided into two broad\nclasses: magnetic clouds (MC) that exhibit the characteristics of magnetic flux\nropes and non-magnetic clouds (NMC) that do not. As CMEs result from eruption\nof magnetic flux ropes, it is important to answer why NMCs do not have the flux\nrope features. One claims that NMCs lose their original flux rope features due\nto the interactions between ICMEs or ICMEs and other large scale structures\nduring their transit in the heliosphere. The other attributes this phenomenon\nto the geometric selection effect, i.e., when an ICME has its nose (flank,\nincluding leg and non-leg flanks) pass through the observing spacecraft, the MC\n(NMC) features will be detected along the spacecraft trajectory within the\nejecta. In this Letter, we examine which explanation is more reasonable through\nthe geometric properties of ICMEs. If the selection effect leads to different\nejecta types, MCs should have narrower sheath region compared to NMCs from the\nstatistical point of view, which is confirmed by our statistics. Besides, we\nfind that NMCs have the similar size in solar cycles 23 and 24, and NMCs are\nsmaller than MCs in cycle 23 but larger than MCs in cycle 24. This suggests\nthat most NMCs have their leg flank pass through the spacecraft.

By preventing the model learning so far from its\nhistorical output distribution space, MrKD can stabilize the learning and find\na more robust minimum. Our experiments show that LsrKD can improve LSR\nperformance consistently at no cost, especially on several deep neural networks\nwhere LSR is ineffectual. Also, MrKD can significantly improve single model\ntraining. The experiment results confirm that the TC can help LsrKD and MrKD to\nboost training, especially on the networks they are failed. Overall, LsrKD,\nMrKD, and their TC variants are comparable to or outperform the LSR method,\nsuggesting the broad applicability of these KD methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Sep 2020 04:23:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-14"}

Domain adaptation techniques\nsolve this problem by training transferable models from the label-rich source\ndomain to the label-scarce target domain.

In this paper, we tackle the challenging zero-shot\ndomain adaptation (ZSDA) problem, where target-domain data is non-available in\nthe training stage. For this purpose, we propose conditional coupled generative\nadversarial networks (CoCoGAN) by extending the coupled generative adversarial\nnetworks (CoGAN) into a conditioning model. Compared with the existing state of\nthe arts, our proposed CoCoGAN is able to capture the joint distribution of\ndual-domain samples in two different tasks, i.e. the relevant task (RT) and an\nirrelevant task (IRT). We train CoCoGAN with both source-domain samples in RT\nand dual-domain samples in IRT to complete the domain adaptation. While the\nformer provide high-level concepts of the non-available target-domain data, the\nlatter carry the sharing correlation between the two domains in RT and IRT. To\ntrain CoCoGAN in the absence of target-domain data for RT, we propose a new\nsupervisory signal, i.e. the alignment between representations across tasks.\nExtensive experiments carried out demonstrate that our proposed CoCoGAN\noutperforms existing state of the arts in image classifications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Sep 2020 04:36:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-14"}

To eliminate the requirement of channel\nestimation and to improve the system performance, in this paper, we adopt a\ndeep transfer learning (DTL) approach to implicitly extract the features of\nchannel and directly recover tag symbols. To this end, we develop a DTL\ndetection framework which consists of offline learning, transfer learning, and\nonline detection.

However, most existing defense approaches are limited to a\nspecific type of adversarial perturbations. Specifically, they often fail to\noffer resistance to multiple attack types simultaneously, i.e., they lack\nmulti-perturbation robustness. Furthermore, compared to image recognition\nproblems, the adversarial robustness of video recognition models is relatively\nunexplored. While several studies have proposed how to generate adversarial\nvideos, only a handful of approaches about defense strategies have been\npublished in the literature. In this paper, we propose one of the first defense\nstrategies against multiple types of adversarial videos for video recognition.\nThe proposed method, referred to as MultiBN, performs adversarial training on\nmultiple adversarial video types using multiple independent batch normalization\n(BN) layers with a learning-based BN selection module. With a multiple BN\nstructure, each BN brach is responsible for learning the distribution of a\nsingle perturbation type and thus provides more precise distribution\nestimations. This mechanism benefits dealing with multiple perturbation types.\nThe BN selection module detects the attack type of an input video and sends it\nto the corresponding BN branch, making MultiBN fully automatic and allowing\nend-to-end training. Compared to present adversarial training approaches, the\nproposed MultiBN exhibits stronger multi-perturbation robustness against\ndifferent and even unforeseen adversarial video types, ranging from Lp-bounded\nattacks and physically realizable attacks. This holds true on different\ndatasets and target models. Moreover, we conduct an extensive analysis to study\nthe properties of the multiple BN structure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Sep 2020 06:07:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Jul 2021 01:18:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 14 Dec 2021 06:38:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-15"}

The second\ncomes from entirely eliminating orthognal pilots by jointly learning a neural\nreceiver together with either superimposed pilots (SIPs), linearly combined\nwith conventional quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), or an optimized\nconstellation geometry. The learned geometry works for a wide range of\nsignal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), Doppler and delay spreads, has zero mean and\ndoes hence not contain any form of superimposed pilots. Both schemes achieve\nthe same BER as the pilot-based baseline with around 7% higher throughput.\nThus, we believe that a jointly learned transmitter and receiver are a very\ninteresting component for beyond-5G communication systems which could remove\nthe need and associated control overhead for demodulation reference signals\n(DMRSs).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Sep 2020 07:33:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 14:43:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 29 Jul 2021 06:26:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-30"}

However,\nboth of these approaches only cover a narrow threat model resulting in limited\nsecurity guarantees. Enclaves in the application processor typically provide\nweak isolation between the secure and non-secure domain, especially when\nconsidering side-channel attacks. Although secure elements do provide strong\nisolation, the slow communication interface to the application processor is\nexposed to adversaries and restricts the use cases. Independently of the used\nimplementation approach, TEEs often lack the possibility to establish secure\ncommunication to external peripherals, and most operating systems executed\ninside TEEs do not provide state-of-the-art defense strategies, making them\nvulnerable against various attacks.

While\nrecent proposed learning-based methods have achieved impressive registration\nperformance on the full shape observations, these methods mostly suffer from\nperformance degradation when dealing with partial shapes. To bridge the\nperformance gaps between partial point set registration with full point set\nregistration, we proposed to incorporate a shape completion network to benefit\nthe registration process. To achieve this, we design a latent code for each\npair of shapes, which can be regarded as a geometric encoding of the target\nshape. By doing so, our model does need an explicit feature embedding network\nto learn the feature encodings. More importantly, both our shape completion\nnetwork and the point set registration network take the shared latent codes as\ninput, which are optimized along with the parameters of two decoder networks in\nthe training process. Therefore, the point set registration process can thus\nbenefit from the joint optimization process of latent codes, which are enforced\nto represent the information of full shape instead of partial ones.

However, when\nlearning the initial representation for a node, most existing work linearly\ncombines the embeddings of node features, without considering the interactions\namong the features (or feature embeddings). We argue that when the node\nfeatures are categorical, e.g., in many real-world applications like user\nprofiling and recommender system, feature interactions usually carry important\nsignals for predictive analytics. Ignoring them will result in suboptimal\ninitial node representation and thus weaken the effectiveness of the follow-up\ngraph convolution. In this paper, we propose a new GCN model named CatGCN,\nwhich is tailored for graph learning when the node features are categorical.\nSpecifically, we integrate two ways of explicit interaction modeling into the\nlearning of initial node representation, i.e., local interaction modeling on\neach pair of node features and global interaction modeling on an artificial\nfeature graph. We then refine the enhanced initial node representations with\nthe neighborhood aggregation-based graph convolution.

Star, complete, cyclic, and diamond graphs, and their\ngeometric intermediates, are tested for four atoms and antiprism structures for\nsix atoms. Spectroscopic resolution (dE/E) less than 10% is achieved and the\nobserved energy level shifts and merges through structural transformations are\nin good agreement with the model few-body quantum-Ising Hamiltonian.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Sep 2020 09:50:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-04"}

We\nperformed plane-wave density functional theory calculations on low-sigma grain\nboundaries - five symmetric tilt GBs (STGBs) and three twist GBs; all with\nmisorientation axes about [0001] and in optimised microscopic configurations -\nto gain insight into the associated atomistic structures. From studying the\ninterface energetics, we found that higher GB excess volumes tended to be\nassociated with higher GB energies. Furthermore, we examined how the\ninterplanar spacing, volume per atom, and local atomic coordination at the GB\ndeviated from equivalent quantities in bulk. We also defined a grain boundary\nwidth according to a threshold value of volume per atom, allowing us to rank\nthe GBs by their relative thickness. We found the twist GBs to exhibit similar\nenergetic and structural properties, whereas the STGBs demonstrated more\nvariation. Our comprehensive analysis demonstrates how all five dimensions of\nGB space are crucial in determining properties such as the work of ideal\nseparation and the length scale over which atoms are perturbed by the presence\nof the GB.

In this paper, we propose an\nL2-constrained Remnant Convolutional Neural Network (L2-constrained RemNet) for\nperforming these two crucial tasks. The proposed network architecture consists\nof a dynamic preprocessor block and a classification block. An L2 loss is\napplied to the output of the preprocessor block, and categorical crossentropy\nloss is calculated based on the output of the classification block. The whole\nnetwork is trained in an end-to-end manner by minimizing the total loss, which\nis a combination of the L2 loss and the categorical crossentropy loss. Aided by\nthe L2 loss, the data-adaptive preprocessor learns to suppress the unnecessary\nimage contents and assists the classification block in extracting robust image\nforensics features. We train and test the network on the Dresden database and\nachieve an overall accuracy of 98.15%, where all the test images are from\ndevices and scenes not used during training to replicate practical\napplications.

Cabell's paywalled blacklist service attempts to\novercome some of these issues in reviewing fraudulent journals on the basis of\ntransparent criteria and in providing allegedly up-to-date information at the\njournal entry level.

The decentralized privacy guarantee of the\nlocal model comes at a high price in statistical utility or computational\ncomplexity.

It is extremely faint, which makes any astronomical observations\ndifficult. However, at least one remotely similar ultra-low-mass object, the M9\ndwarf TVLM 513-46546, has been shown to be a steady radio emitter at\nfrequencies up to 95 GHz with superimposed active states where strong, pulsed\nemission is observed. Aims: Our goal is to determine the millimeter radio\nproperties of W0855 with deep observations around 93 GHz (3.2 mm) in order to\ninvestigate whether radio astrometry of this object is feasible and to measure\nor set an upper limit on its magnetic field. Methods: We observed W0855 for 94\nmin at 85.1-100.9 GHz on 24 December 2019 using 44 of the Atacama Large\nmillimeter Array (ALMA) 12 m antennas. We used the standard ALMA calibration\nprocedure and created the final image for our analysis by accommodating the\nQuasar 3C 209, the brightest nearby object by far.

These considerations are\nessential in the context of the development of reliable, inexpensive and\nenvironmentally friendly alloys. However, despite significant progress in\ncomputer performance, QM simulations of defects are still extremely\ntime-consuming with ab-initio/non-parametric methods. The two-centre\nSlater-Koster (SK) tight-binding (TB) models can achieve significant\ncomputational efficiency and provide an interpretable picture of the electronic\nstructure. In some cases, this makes TB a compelling alternative to models\nbased on abstraction of the electronic structure, such as the embedded atom\nmodel. The biggest challenge in the implementation of the SK method is the\nestimation of the optimal and transferable parameters that are used to\nconstruct the Hamiltonian matrix. In this paper, we will present results of the\ndevelopment of a data-driven framework, following the classical approach of\nadjusting parameters in order to recreate properties that can be measured or\nestimated using ab-initio or non-parametric methods. Distinct features include\nincorporation of data from QSGW (quasi-particle self-consistent GW\napproximation) calculations, as well as consideration of higher-order elastic\nconstants. Furthermore, we provide a description of the optimisation procedure,\nomitted in many publications, including the design stage.

The peak\nwavenumber (m) and the width parameter (C2) prescribe the spectral location and\nbroadening, respectively, when the Reynolds number increases, where C2 has ~\n1/Rem dependence. The energy scale is adjusted with a multiplicative factor. In\nthis perspective, the inertial scaling from k-3 to k-5/3 when the flow\ntransitions from two- to three-dimensions is explained as the increase in\nspectral width since the range of scales increases as Re1/6 and Re3/4 for two\nand three-dimensional turbulence, respectively.

The flare strength is affected more by larger amplitude\noscillations but is relatively insensitive to the frequency of oscillations. In\nthe most extreme case the peak kinetic energy of the flare increased more than\nthreefold compared to a non-oscillating BR.

The proposed attention model\nconsists of a self-attention module and a mutual attention module, which\njointly contributes to the generation of the utterance-level embedding.

The enriched stars that do\nform through this process have absolute metallicities below $10^{-3}\\,Z_\\odot$.\nWe also find that the fraction of externally enriched halos increases with\ntime, $\\sim 90\\%$ of halos that are externally enriched have $M_\\mathrm{vir} <\n10^6\\,M_\\odot$, and that pair-instability supernovae contribute the most to the\nenrichment of the IGM as a whole and are thus are the predominant supernova\ntype contributing to the external enrichment of halos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Sep 2020 15:50:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 10 Jan 2021 22:28:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-17"}

A possible solution to address the lack of agreement is to combine\nthe results from multiple feature importance quantifiers to reduce the variance\nof estimates. Our hypothesis is that this will lead to more robust and\ntrustworthy interpretations of the contribution of each feature to machine\nlearning predictions. To assist test this hypothesis, we propose an extensible\nFramework divided in four main parts: (i) traditional data pre-processing and\npreparation for predictive machine learning models; (ii) predictive machine\nlearning; (iii) feature importance quantification and (iv) feature importance\ndecision fusion using an ensemble strategy.

Finally, the methodology is applied to the Landau gauge gluon\nand ghost propagators, obtained via lattice simulations. The results identify a\nconjugate pair of complex poles for the gluon propagator, that is associated\nwith the infrared structure of the theory. This is in line with the presence of\nsingularities for complex momenta in theories where confinement is observed.\nRegarding the ghost propagator, a pole at $p^2=0$ is identified. For both\npropagators, a branch cut is found on the real negative $p^2$-axis, which\nrecovers the perturbative analysis at high momenta.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Sep 2020 15:44:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-21"}

Due to the\nimportance of chest x-ray data in studying COVID-19, there is a demand for\nstate-of-the-art models capable of precisely segmenting soft tissue on the\nchest x-rays. The dataset for exploring best segmentation model is from\nMontgomery and Shenzhen hospital which had opened in 2014. The most famous\ntechnique is U-Net which has been used to many medical datasets including the\nChest X-rays. However, most variant U-Nets mainly focus on extraction of\ncontextual information and skip connections. There is still a large space for\nimproving extraction of spatial features. In this paper, we propose a dual\nencoder fusion U-Net framework for Chest X-rays based on Inception\nConvolutional Neural Network with dilation, Densely Connected Recurrent\nConvolutional Neural Network, which is named DEFU-Net. The densely connected\nrecurrent path extends the network deeper for facilitating contextual feature\nextraction. In order to increase the width of network and enrich representation\nof features, the inception blocks with dilation are adopted. The inception\nblocks can capture globally and locally spatial information from various\nreceptive fields. At the same time, the two paths are fused by summing\nfeatures, thus preserving the contextual and spatial information for decoding\npart. This multi-learning-scale model is benefiting in Chest X-ray dataset from\ntwo different manufacturers (Montgomery and Shenzhen hospital). The DEFU-Net\nachieves the better performance than basic U-Net, residual U-Net, BCDU-Net,\nR2U-Net and attention R2U-Net.

One eventual application is to provide\nassistive technology and sign language detection for the hearing impaired. My\nsystem, called LiTe (Light-based Technology), uses optical fibers embedded into\na wristband. The wrist is an optimal place for the band since the light\npropagation in the optical fibers is impacted even by the slight movements of\nthe tendons in the wrist when gestures are performed. The prototype\nincorporates light dependent resistors to measure these light propagation\nchanges. When creating LiTe, I considered a variety of fiber materials, light\nfrequencies, and physical shapes to optimize the tendon movement detection so\nthat it can be accurately correlated with different gestures. I implemented and\nevaluated two approaches for gesture recognition. The first uses an algorithm\nthat combines moving averages of sensor readings with gesture sensor reading\nsignatures to determine the current gesture. The second uses a neural network\ntrained on a labelled set of gesture readings to recognize gestures. Using the\nsignature-based approach, I was able to achieve a 99.8% accuracy at recognizing\ndistinct gestures. Using the neural network the recognition accuracy was 98.8%.\nThis shows that high accuracy is feasible using both approaches. The results\nindicate that this novel method of using fiber optics-based sensors is a\npromising first step to creating a gesture recognition system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Sep 2020 01:36:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-29"}

They discovered second order CC, well known for M,\nbut also third order CC for S and K. In a recent paper, we have studied the\ncases of M and S, without using specific technical tools such as Teukolski\nscalars or Killing-Yano tensors. However, even if S($m$) and K($m,a$) are\ndepending on constant parameters in such a way that S $\\rightarrow $ M when $m\n\\rightarrow 0$ and K $\\rightarrow$ S when $ a \\rightarrow 0$, the CC of S do\nnot provide the CC of M when $m \\rightarrow 0$ while the CC of K do not provide\nthe CC of S when $a\\rightarrow 0$.

As the algebroid bracket is compatible with the {\\it\nprolongation/projection} (PP) procedure, we provide for the first time all the\nCC for K in an intrinsic way, showing that they only depend on the underlying\nKilling algebras and that the role played by the Spencer operator is crucial.\nWe get K$<$S$<$M with $2 < 4 < 10$ for the Killing algebras and explain why the\nformal search of the CC for M, S or K are strikingly different, even though\neach Spencer sequence is isomorphic to the tensor product of the Poincar\\'{e}\nsequence for the exterior derivative by the corresponding Lie algebra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Sep 2020 14:18:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-02"}

One significant example\nof the principal emerging fields in this context is the PT symmetric wireless\napplications using multiple coils that are spatially separated but mutually\ncoupled with position-dependent coupling strength. Such a spatial PT\nconfiguration limits the flexibility and miniaturization of the PT symmetric\ndesigns. As far as this is concerned, inspired by scattering induced two\nopposite whispering-gallery (WG) modes in an optical resonator, analogously\nhere we experimentally demonstrate a specially constructed second-order (2-nd\norder) PT symmetry in a single coil resonator, whose currents with two\ndifferent directions are excited by internal bypass capacitor. Our proposed\nstructure has the following peculiar feature: First, the bypass capacitor\ninduces coupling in spectral resonances allow us to observe a 2-nd order phase\ntransition between symmetry regimes, without the need of a second coil in the\nspatial PT case. Under this circumstance, this specially constructed PT\nsymmetry can be regarded as synthetic PT symmetry, which is enabled by coupling\nmodes with different directions. Second, by introducing two or more internal\nbypass capacitors, the synthetic high-order PT symmetric system bearing such as\nthird-order exceptional point in a single coil resonator can be realized. These\nresults will provide a new paradigm to realize higher-order PT symmetry towards\nthe investigation of non-Hermitian physics in a synthetic perspective, which\ncan be extended to other physical platforms such as optics and acoustics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Sep 2020 02:35:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-21"}

In this work, we report the experimental results for a subwavelength\nplanar microwave-regime waveguide fabricated from circuit-based magnetic\nhyperbolic metamaterial (HMM) and develop the associated theory. HMM is a\nspecial type of anisotropic metamaterial whose isofrequency contour (IFC) takes\nthe form of an open hyperboloid. Because of the open-dispersion IFCs, HMMs\nsupport propagating high-k modes with large effective refractive indices, which\nallows planar hyperbolic waveguides to be miniaturized. In particular, as\nopposed to the traditional dielectric slab waveguide, the group velocity of the\nhyperbolic guided modes is negative-a characteristic that can be exploited to\nrealize the backward propagation of electromagnetic waves. Furthermore, we\nstudy the abnormal photonic spin Hall effect and experimentally demonstrate an\nultracompact backward coupler based on hyperbolic waveguides.
