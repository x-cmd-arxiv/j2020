However, manual labeling is time\nconsuming and laborious. At the extreme, the corresponding annotated data are\nunavailable. Exploiting synthetic data is a very promising solution except for\ndomain distribution mismatches between synthetic datasets and real datasets. To\naddress the severe domain distribution mismatch, we propose a synthetic-to-real\ndomain adaptation method for scene text detection, which transfers knowledge\nfrom synthetic data (source domain) to real data (target domain). In this\npaper, a text self-training (TST) method and adversarial text instance\nalignment (ATA) for domain adaptive scene text detection are introduced. ATA\nhelps the network learn domain-invariant features by training a domain\nclassifier in an adversarial manner. TST diminishes the adverse effects of\nfalse positives~(FPs) and false negatives~(FNs) from inaccurate pseudo-labels.\nTwo components have positive effects on improving the performance of scene text\ndetectors when adapting from synthetic-to-real scenes. We evaluate the proposed\nmethod by transferring from SynthText, VISD to ICDAR2015, ICDAR2013. The\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method with up to 10%\nimprovement, which has important exploration significance for domain adaptive\nscene text detection.

However, higher sampling rate causes\nthe wider frequency band and longer waveform sequences and throws challenges\nfor singing voice synthesis (SVS) in both frequency and time domains.\nConventional SVS systems that adopt small sampling rate cannot well address the\nabove challenges. In this paper, we develop HiFiSinger, an SVS system towards\nhigh-fidelity singing voice. HiFiSinger consists of a FastSpeech based acoustic\nmodel and a Parallel WaveGAN based vocoder to ensure fast training and\ninference and also high voice quality. To tackle the difficulty of singing\nmodeling caused by high sampling rate (wider frequency band and longer\nwaveform), we introduce multi-scale adversarial training in both the acoustic\nmodel and vocoder to improve singing modeling. Specifically, 1) To handle the\nlarger range of frequencies caused by higher sampling rate, we propose a novel\nsub-frequency GAN (SF-GAN) on mel-spectrogram generation, which splits the full\n80-dimensional mel-frequency into multiple sub-bands and models each sub-band\nwith a separate discriminator. 2) To model longer waveform sequences caused by\nhigher sampling rate, we propose a multi-length GAN (ML-GAN) for waveform\ngeneration to model different lengths of waveform sequences with separate\ndiscriminators. 3) We also introduce several additional designs and findings in\nHiFiSinger that are crucial for high-fidelity voices, such as adding F0 (pitch)\nand V/UV (voiced/unvoiced flag) as acoustic features, choosing an appropriate\nwindow/hop size for mel-spectrogram, and increasing the receptive field in\nvocoder for long vowel modeling. Experiment results show that HiFiSinger\nsynthesizes high-fidelity singing voices with much higher quality: 0.32/0.44\nMOS gain over 48kHz/24kHz baseline and 0.83 MOS gain over previous SVS systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Sep 2020 16:31:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-04"}

However, such a reconstruction suffers from high noise and\nsevere artifacts due to the incompleteness of sinogram. To derive quality\nreconstruction, previous state-of-the-art methods use UNet-like neural\narchitectures to directly predict the full view reconstruction from limited\nview data; but these methods leave the deep network architecture issue largely\nintact and cannot guarantee the consistency between the sinogram of the\nreconstructed image and the acquired sinogram, leading to a non-ideal\nreconstruction. In this work, we propose a novel recurrent reconstruction\nframework that stacks the same block multiple times. The recurrent block\nconsists of a custom-designed residual dense spatial-channel attention network.\nFurther, we develop a sinogram consistency layer interleaved in our recurrent\nframework in order to ensure that the sampled sinogram is consistent with the\nsinogram of the intermediate outputs of the recurrent blocks.

We aim at exploring to which extent the remnant keeps memory of the\nasymmetries that develop stochastically in the neutrino-heating layer due to\nhydrodynamic instabilities (e.g., convective overturn and the standing\naccretion shock instability) during the first second after core bounce. We\ncoupled a 3D HD model of a neutrino-driven SN explosion with 3D MHD/HD\nsimulations of the remnant formation. The simulations cover 2000 years of\nexpansion and include all physical processes relevant to describe the\ncomplexities in the SN evolution and the subsequent interaction of the stellar\ndebris with the wind of the progenitor star. The interaction of large-scale\nasymmetries left from the earliest phases of the explosion with the reverse\nshock produces, at the age of $\\approx 350$~years, an ejecta structure and a\nremnant morphology which are remarkably similar to those observed in Cas A.\nSmall-scale structures in the large-scale Fe-rich plumes created during the\ninitial stages of the SN, combined with HD instabilities that develop after the\npassage of the reverse shock, naturally produce a pattern of ring- and\ncrown-like structures of shocked ejecta. The consequence is a spatial inversion\nof the ejecta layers with Si-rich ejecta being physically interior to Fe-rich\nejecta. The full-fledged remnant shows voids and cavities in the innermost\nunshocked ejecta resulting from the expansion of Fe-rich plumes and their\ninflation due to the decay of radioactive species. The asymmetric distributions\nof $^{44}$Ti and $^{56}$Fe and their abundance ratio are both compatible with\nthose inferred from high-energy observations of Chandra and NuSTAR.

The accuracy achievable with these motion estimation techniques\nis strongly contingent upon two contradictory requirements: a high quality of\nconsecutive frames and a high frame rate. Indeed, the image quality can usually\nbe improved by increasing the number of steered ultrafast acquisitions, but at\nthe expense of a reduced frame rate and possible motion artifacts. To achieve\naccurate motion estimation at uncompromised frame rates and immune to motion\nartifacts, the proposed approach relies on single ultrafast acquisitions to\nreconstruct high-quality frames and on only two consecutive frames to obtain\n2-D displacement estimates.

Low-mass ETGs have characteristic peaked rotation profiles\nand near-oblate shapes with rounder halos that are completely driven by the\nin-situ stars. At high $f_{ex}$ major mergers decrease the in-situ peak in\nrotation velocity, flatten the $V_{*}/\\sigma_{*}(R)$ profiles, and increase the\ntriaxiality of the stellar halos. Kinematic transition radii do not trace the\ntransition between in-situ and ex-situ dominated regions, but for systems with\n$M_{*}>10^{10.6}M_\\odot$ the local rotational support decreases with the local\nex-situ fraction $f_{ex}(R)$ and triaxiality increases with $f_{ex}$.

Near a filling of one electron per moir'e unit cell, we\nobserve a dramatic increase in the electronic entropy to about 1kB per unit\ncell. This large excess entropy is quenched by an in-plane magnetic field,\npointing to its magnetic origin. A sharp drop in the compressibility as a\nfunction of the electron density, associated with a reset of the Fermi level\nback to the vicinity of the Dirac point, marks a clear boundary between two\nphases. We map this jump as a function of electron density, temperature, and\nmagnetic field. This reveals a phase diagram that is consistent with a\nPomeranchuk-like temperature- and field-driven transition from a low-entropy\nelectronic liquid to a high-entropy correlated state with nearly-free magnetic\nmoments. The correlated state features an unusual combination of seemingly\ncontradictory properties, some associated with itinerant electrons, such as the\nabsence of a thermodynamic gap, metallicity, and a Dirac-like compressibility,\nand others associated with localized moments, such as a large entropy and its\ndisappearance with magnetic field. Moreover, the energy scales characterizing\nthese two sets of properties are very different: whereas the compressibility\njump onsets at T~30K, the bandwidth of magnetic excitations is ~3K or smaller.\nThe hybrid nature of the new correlated state and the large separation of\nenergy scales have key implications for the physics of correlated states in\ntwisted bilayer graphene.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Sep 2020 17:59:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Sep 2020 15:31:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-28"}

After choosing their best\ninternal parameters configuration, we assess their performance as a function of\nresolution, background level, and image type, also testing their ability to\npreserve the objects fluxes and shapes. We analyze in terms of completeness and\npurity the catalogs extracted after applying denoising algorithms on a\nsimulated Euclid Wide Survey VIS image, on real H160 (HST) and K-band (HAWK-I)\nobservations of the CANDELS GOODS-South field. Denoising algorithms often\noutperform the standard approach of filtering with the Point Spread Function\n(PSF) of the image. Applying Structure-Texture image decomposition,\nPerona-Malik filtering, the Total Variation method by Chambolle, and Bilateral\nfiltering on the Euclid-VIS image, we obtain catalogs that are both more pure\nand complete by 0.2 magnitudes than those based on the standard approach. The\nsame result is achieved with the Structure-Texture image decomposition\nalgorithm applied on the H160 image. The advantage of denoising techniques with\nrespect to PSF filtering increases at increasing depth. Moreover, these\ntechniques better preserve the shape of the detected objects with respect to\nPSF smoothing. Denoising algorithms provide significant improvements in the\ndetection of faint objects and enhance the scientific return of current and\nfuture extragalactic surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Sep 2020 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-04"}

However,\nfor large RH neutrino masses, gravity can play an important role. We study the\ninterplay between the neutrino portal through the right-handed neutrinos and\nthe gravity portal through the massless spin-2 graviton in producing dark\nmatter particles in the early universe. As a concrete example, we consider the\nminimal and realistic Littlest Seesaw model with two RH neutrinos, augmented\nwith a dark scalar and a dark fermion charged under a global $U(1)_D$ dark\nsymmetry. In the model, the usual seesaw neutrino Yukawa couplings and the\nright-handed neutrino masses (the lightest being about $5\\times 10^{10}$ GeV)\nare fixed by neutrino oscillations data and leptogenesis. Hence, we explore the\nparameter space of the two RH neutrino portal couplings, the two dark particle\nmasses and the reheating temperature of the universe, where the correct dark\nmatter relic abundance is achieved through the freeze-in mechanism. In\nparticular, we highlight which class of processes dominate the dark matter\nproduction. We find that, despite the presence of the gravity portal, the dark\nmatter production relies on the usual seesaw neutrino Yukawa coupling in some\nregions of the parameter space, so realising a direct link between dark matter\nand neutrino phenomenology. Finally, we report the threshold values for the\nneutrino portal couplings below which the neutrino portal is irrelevant and the\nPlanckian Interacting Dark Matter paradigm is preserved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Sep 2020 18:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Jan 2021 16:28:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-21"}

Yet, theoretical efforts have been hampered by the complexity of\nWolf-Rayet (WR) winds arising from the more massive helium stars.

In order to match\nthe astrometric period of this flare, the near horizon magnetic field is\nrequired to have a significant poloidal component, which is associated with\nstrong and dynamically important fields. The observed linear polarisation\nfraction of $\\simeq 30\\%$ is smaller than the one predicted by our model\n($\\simeq 50\\%$).

We simulate $\\sim 2$ million models to explore the parameter space\nthat is relevant to real clusters and over all mass scales. We show that when\nuncertainties on the initial cluster mass function and density are properly\ntaken into account, they become the two dominant factors in setting the\ntheoretical error bars on merger rates. Other model parameters (e.g., natal\nkicks, black hole masses, metallicity) have virtually no effect on the local\nmerger rate density, although they affect the masses of the merging black\nholes. Modelling the merger rate density as a function of redshift as\n$R(z)=R_0(1+z)^\\kappa$ at $z<2$, and marginalizing over uncertainties, we find:\n$R_0=7.2^{+21.5}_{-5.5}{\\rm Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}}$ and $\\kappa=1.6^{+0.4}_{-0.6}$\n($90\\%$ credibility).

This\nworks well in versions of type theory where the principle of unique identity\nproofs (UIP) holds. In homotopy type theory (HoTT) however, it is a\nlong-standing and frequently discussed open problem whether the type theory\n\"eats itself\" and can serve as its own interpreter. The fundamental underlying\ndifficulty seems to be that categories are not suitable to capture a type\ntheory in the absence of UIP.\n  In this paper, we develop a notion of $\\infty$-categories with families\n($\\infty$-CwF's). The approach to higher categories used relies on the\npreviously suggested semi-Segal types, with a new construction of identity\nsubstitutions that allow for both univalent and non-univalent variations. The\ntype-theoretic universe as well as the internalised syntax are models, although\nit remains a conjecture that the latter is initial. To circumvent the known\nunsolved problem of constructing semisimplicial types, the definition is\npresented in two-level type theory (2LTT).\n  Apart from introducing $\\infty$-CwF's, the paper explains the shortcomings of\n1-categories in type theory without UIP as well as the difficulties of and\napproaches to internal higher-dimensional categories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Sep 2020 18:54:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 30 Jan 2021 22:43:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-02"}

A\nspecial emphasis is paid to the spatial distribution of gas and grown dust\n(from 1 mm to a few cm) during and after the burst. Methods: Numerical\nhydrodynamics simulations using the FEOSAD code were employed to study the\ndynamics of gas and dust in the thin-disk limit. Dust-to-gas friction including\nback reaction and dust growth were also considered. Bursts of various duration\n(from 100 to 500 yr) were initiated in accordance with a thermally ignited\nmagnetorotational instability. Luminosity curves for constant- and\ndeclining-magnitude bursts were adopted to represent two typical limiting cases\nfor FU-Orionis-type eruptions. Results: The short-term effect of the burst is\nto reduce the strength of gravitational instability by heating and expanding\nthe disk. The longest bursts with duration comparable to the revolution period\nof the spiral can completely dissolve the original two-armed spiral pattern in\nthe gas disk by the end of the burst, while the shortest bursts only weaken the\nspiral pattern. The reaction of grown dust to the burst is somewhat different.\nThe spiral-like initial distribution with deep cavities in the inter-armed\nregions transforms into a ring-like distribution with deep gaps. This\ntransformation is most expressed for the longest-duration bursts. The long-term\neffect of the burst depends on the initial disk conditions at the onset of the\nburst. In some cases, vigorous disk fragmentation sets in several thousand\nyears after the burst, which was absent in the model without the bursts\n(abridged).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Sep 2020 19:10:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-28"}

They are subsequently subject to destruction by thermal\nand kinetic sputtering as they traverse the remnant. Grains that are large\nenough ($\\sim 0.25\\,\\mu$m for silicates and $\\sim 0.1\\,\\mu$m for carbonaceous\ngrains) escape into the interstellar medium while smaller grains get trapped\nand destroyed. However, grains that reach the interstellar medium still have\nhigh velocities, and are subject to further destruction as they are slowed\ndown. We find that for initial grain size distributions that include large\n($\\sim 0.25 - 0.5\\,\\mu$m) grains, 10--20\\% of silicate grains can survive,\nwhile 30--50\\% of carbonaceous grains survive even when the initial size\ndistribution cuts off at smaller ($0.25\\,\\mu$m) sizes.

Typically, the resulting\nleading order predictions for the oscillation parameters require corrections in\norder to comply with neutrino oscillation data. We introduce such corrections\nthrough an explicit small breaking of the symmetry.\n  This has the advantage of solving the cosmological problems of these models\nwithout resorting to inflation. The explicit breaking induces an energy\ndifference or \"bias\" between different vacua and drives the evolution of the\ndomain walls, unavoidably produced after the symmetry breaking, towards their\nannihilation. Importantly, the wall annihilation leads to gravitational waves\nwhich may be observed in current and/or future experiments. We show that a\ndistinctive pattern of gravitational waves with multiple overlapped peaks is\ngenerated when walls annihilate, which is within the reach of future detectors.\nWe also show that cosmic walls from discrete flavor symmetries can be\ncosmologically safe for any spontaneous breaking scale between 1 and $10^{18}$\nGeV, if the bias is chosen adequately, without the need to inflate the walls\naway.

Unfortunately, the\nmathematical formulation of numerical differentiation is typically ill-posed,\nand researchers often resort to an \\textit{ad hoc} process for choosing one of\nmany computational methods and its parameters. In this work, we take a\nprincipled approach and propose a multi-objective optimization framework for\nchoosing parameters that minimize a loss function to balance the faithfulness\nand smoothness of the derivative estimate. Our framework has three significant\nadvantages. First, the task of selecting multiple parameters is reduced to\nchoosing a single hyper-parameter. Second, where ground-truth data is unknown,\nwe provide a heuristic for automatically selecting this hyper-parameter based\non the power spectrum and temporal resolution of the data. Third, the optimal\nvalue of the hyper-parameter is consistent across different differentiation\nmethods, thus our approach unifies vastly different numerical differentiation\nmethods and facilitates unbiased comparison of their results. Finally, we\nprovide an extensive open-source Python library \\texttt{pynumdiff} to\nfacilitate easy application to diverse datasets\n(https://github.com/florisvb/PyNumDiff).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Sep 2020 20:14:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Sep 2020 20:32:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-09"}

In addition, the\nscheme is general and can be applied to any communication network, and to any\npublic-key cryptosystem. Our hybrid scheme is based on the information\ntheoretic notion of individual secrecy, which traditionally relies on the\nassumption that an eavesdropper can only observe a subset of the communication\nlinks between the trusted parties - an assumption that is often challenging to\nenforce. For this setting, several code constructions have been developed,\nwhere the messages are linearly mixed before transmission over each of the\npaths in a way that guarantees that an adversary which observes only a subset\nhas sufficient uncertainty about each individual message.\n  Instead, in this paper, we take a computational viewpoint, and construct a\ncoding scheme in which an arbitrary secure cryptosystem is utilized on a subset\nof the links, while a pre-processing similar to the one in individual security\nis utilized. Under this scheme, we demonstrate 1) a computational security\nguarantee for an adversary which observes the entirety of the links 2) an\ninformation theoretic security guarantee for an adversary which observes a\nsubset of the links, and 3) information rates which approach the capacity of\nthe network and greatly improve upon the current solutions.\n  A perhaps surprising consequence of our scheme is that, to guarantee a\ncomputational security level b, it is sufficient to encrypt a single link using\na computational post-quantum scheme. In addition, the information rate\napproaches 1 as the number of communication links increases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Sep 2020 21:19:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-07"}

To\nunravel this mystery, we recorded the acoustic nearfield generated by six\nfreely hovering Annas hummingbirds using a 2176 microphone array. We also\ndirectly measured the 3D aerodynamic forces generated by the hummingbird in\nvivo using a new aerodynamic force platform. To determine the degree to which\nthe aerodynamic forces cause the hum, we developed a simple first-principles\nmodel to predict the acoustic field radiated by the 3D oscillating forces. The\ncorrespondence between the predicted and measured acoustic field shows the\nprimary acoustic sources of the hum are the lift and drag forces that oscillate\nas the flapping wings move back and forth. The model also shows how the\naerodynamic force profile of the flapping wing determines the hums timbre and\nsound pressure level: profiles that support bodyweight with higher harmonics\nradiate more acoustic power. Further, extending this model across birds and\nflying insects, we show how the radiated acoustic power scales with body mass\nto the second power - with allometric deviation making larger birds quieter and\nelongated flies louder. The model's ability to predict the acoustic signature\nof flapping wings suggests it can be applied for such diverse uses as\ndifferentiating wing and feather sounds in bird display behaviors to\ninterpreting how insects generate courtship songs with their wings to making\nflapping robot wings more silent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Sep 2020 21:27:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-07"}

To correct for\nthe instrumental systematics observed in the data reduced with the current\nversion of the HARPS-N data reduction software (DRS version 3.7), we adapted\nthe newly available ESPRESSO DRS (version 2.2.3) to HARPS-N and developed new\noptimized recipes for the spectrograph. We then compared the first three years\nof HARPS-N solar data reduced with the current and new DRS. The most\nsignificant improvement brought by the new DRS is a strong decrease in the\nday-to-day radial-velocity scatter, from 1.27 to 1.07\\ms; this is thanks to a\nmore robust method to derive wavelength solutions, but also to the use of\ncalibrations closer in time. The newly derived solar radial-velocities are also\nbetter correlated with the chromospheric activity level of the Sun on the\nlong-term, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.93 compared to 0.77\nbefore, which is expected from our understanding of stellar signals. Finally,\nwe also discuss how HARPS-N spectral ghosts contaminate the measurement of the\ncalcium activity index, and present an efficient technique to derive an index\nfree of instrumental systematics. This paper presents a new data reduction\nsoftware for HARPS-N, and demonstrates its improvements [...]\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Sep 2020 22:24:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 May 2021 19:40:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-10"}

We discover quantum memory, particularly resonant cavities with\ntransmon qubits arranged in a 2.5D architecture, can efficiently implement\nsurface codes with substantial hardware savings and performance/fidelity gains.\nSpecifically, we *virtualize logical qubits* by storing them in layers\ndistributed across qubit memories connected to each transmon.\n  Surprisingly, distributing each logical qubit across many memories has a\nminimal impact on fault tolerance and results in substantially more efficient\noperations. Our design permits fast transversal CNOT operations between logical\nqubits sharing the same physical address which are 6x faster than lattice\nsurgery CNOTs. We develop a novel embedding which saves ~10x in transmons with\nanother 2x from an additional optimization for compactness.\n  Although Virtualized Logical Qubits (VLQ) pays a 10x penalty in\nserialization, advantages in the transversal CNOT and area efficiency result in\nperformance comparable to 2D transmon-only architectures. Our simulations show\nfault tolerance comparable to 2D architectures while saving substantial\nhardware. Furthermore, VLQ can produce magic states 1.22x faster for a fixed\nnumber of transmon qubits. This is a critical benchmark for future\nfault-tolerant quantum computers.

Rendering online dynamic networks is a more\nchallenging problem since it requires a balance between timeliness for\nmonitoring tasks -- so that the animations do not lag too far behind the events\n-- and clarity for comprehension tasks -- to minimize simultaneous changes that\nmay be difficult to follow. To illustrate the challenges placed by these\nrequirements, we explore three strategies to stage animations for online\ndynamic networks: time-based, event-based, and a new hybrid approach that we\nintroduce by combining the advantages of the first two.

Recently, automated neural architecture search (NAS) emerges as the\ndefault technique to find a state-of-the-art CNN architecture with higher\naccuracy than manually-designed architectures for image classification. In this\npaper, we present a fast NPU-aware NAS methodology, called S3NAS, to find a CNN\narchitecture with higher accuracy than the existing ones under a given latency\nconstraint. It consists of three steps: supernet design, Single-Path NAS for\nfast architecture exploration, and scaling. To widen the search space of the\nsupernet structure that consists of stages, we allow stages to have a different\nnumber of blocks and blocks to have parallel layers of different kernel sizes.\nFor a fast neural architecture search, we apply a modified Single-Path NAS\ntechnique to the proposed supernet structure. In this step, we assume a shorter\nlatency constraint than the required to reduce the search space and the search\ntime. The last step is to scale up the network maximally within the latency\nconstraint. For accurate latency estimation, an analytical latency estimator is\ndevised, based on a cycle-level NPU simulator that runs an entire CNN\nconsidering the memory access overhead accurately. With the proposed\nmethodology, we are able to find a network in 3 hours using TPUv3, which shows\n82.72% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with 11.66 ms latency.

Plausible\ndeniability (PD) mechanisms resolve this by enabling users to hide the mere\nexistence of sensitive data, often by providing plausible \"cover texts\" or\n\"public data volumes\" hosted on the same device.\n  Unfortunately, with the increasing prevalence of (NAND) flash as a\nhigh-performance cost-effective storage medium, PD becomes even more\nchallenging in the presence of realistic adversaries who can usually access a\ndevice at multiple points in time (\"multi-snapshot\"). This is because\nread/write operations to flash do not result in intuitive corresponding changes\nto the underlying device state. The problem is further compounded by the fact\nthat this behavior is mostly proprietary. For example, in a majority of\ncommercially-available flash devices, an issued delete or overwrite operation\nfrom the upper layers almost certainly won't result in an actual immediate\nerase of the underlying flash cells.\n  To address these challenges, we designed a new class of write-once memory\n(WOM) codes to store hidden bits in the same physical locations as other public\nbits. This is made possible by the inherent nature of NAND flash and the\npossibility of issuing multiple writes to target cells that have not previous\nbeen written to in existing pages.\n  We designed PEARL, a general-purpose Flash Translation Layer (FTL) that\nallows users to plausibly deniably store hidden data in NAND flash devices. We\nimplemented and evaluated PEARL on a widely used simulator FlashSim (Kim et al.\n2019). PEARL performs well on real-world workloads, comparably to non-PD\nbaselines.

Most current MMT models resort to attention mechanism, global\ncontext modeling or multimodal joint representation learning to utilize visual\nfeatures. However, the attention mechanism lacks sufficient semantic\ninteractions between modalities while the other two provide fixed visual\ncontext, which is unsuitable for modeling the observed variability when\ngenerating translation. To address the above issues, in this paper, we propose\na novel Dynamic Context-guided Capsule Network (DCCN) for MMT. Specifically, at\neach timestep of decoding, we first employ the conventional source-target\nattention to produce a timestep-specific source-side context vector. Next, DCCN\ntakes this vector as input and uses it to guide the iterative extraction of\nrelated visual features via a context-guided dynamic routing mechanism.\nParticularly, we represent the input image with global and regional visual\nfeatures, we introduce two parallel DCCNs to model multimodal context vectors\nwith visual features at different granularities. Finally, we obtain two\nmultimodal context vectors, which are fused and incorporated into the decoder\nfor the prediction of the target word. Experimental results on the Multi30K\ndataset of English-to-German and English-to-French translation demonstrate the\nsuperiority of DCCN.

Agents have access only to local information,\nthe information updates are asynchronous and our aim is to obtain relevant\nequilibrium policies. Our approach is to consider optimal open-loop control\nuntil the information update, which allows managing the belief updates in a\nstructured manner. The agents continuously control the rates of their Poisson\nsearch clocks to acquire the locks, and they get rewards at every successful\nacquisition; an acquisition is successful if all the previous stages are\nsuccessful and if the agent is the first one to complete. However, none of them\nhave access to the acquisition status of the other agents, leading to an\nasymmetric information game. Using standard tools of optimal control theory and\nMarkov decision process (MDP) we solved a bi-level control problem; every stage\nof the dynamic programming equation of the MDP is solved using optimal control\ntools. We finally reduced the game with an infinite number of states and\ninfinite-dimensional actions to a finite state game with one-dimensional\nactions. We provided closed-form expressions for Nash Equilibrium in some\nspecial cases and derived asymptotic expressions for some more.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Sep 2020 08:16:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-07"}

We explored\nthis optical-GeV connection in four flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) by a\nsystematic investigation of their long term optical and $\\gamma$-ray light\ncurves. On analysis of the four sources, namely 3C 273, 3C 279, PKS 1510$-$089\nand CTA 102 we noticed different behaviours between the optical and GeV flux\nvariations.

To\nunderstand these diverse behaviours, we carried out broad band spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) modelling of the sources at different epochs using a\none-zone leptonic emission model. The optical-UV emission is found to be\ndominated by emission from the accretion disk in the sources PKS 1510$-$089,\nCTA 102 and 3C 273, while in 3C 279, the synchrotron radiation from the jet\ndominates the optical-UV emission.

Because of the use of the valuation, the theory of tropical Gr{\\\"o}bner\nbases has proved to provide settings for computations over polynomial rings\nover a p-adic field that are more stable than that of classical Gr{\\\"o}bner\nbases. In this article, we investigate how the FGLM change of ordering\nalgorithm can be adapted to the tropical setting. As the valuations of the\npolynomial coefficients are taken into account, the classical FGLM algorithm's\nincremental way, monomo-mial by monomial, to compute the multiplication\nmatrices and the change of basis matrix can not be transposed at all to the\ntropical setting. We mitigate this issue by developing new linear algebra\nalgorithms and apply them to our new tropical FGLM algorithms. Motivations are\ntwofold. Firstly, to compute tropical varieties, one usually goes through the\ncomputation of many tropical Gr{\\\"o}bner bases defined for varying weights (and\nthen varying term orders). For an ideal of dimension 0, the tropical FGLM\nalgorithm provides an efficient way to go from a tropical Gr{\\\"o}bner basis\nfrom one weight to one for another weight. Secondly, the FGLM strategy can be\napplied to go from a tropical Gr{\\\"o}bner basis to a classical Gr{\\\"o}bner\nbasis.

The ice giants are the least understood planets in the solar\nsystem, having been only visited by a single spacecraft, in 1986 and 1989,\nrespectively. The upper atmosphere plays a critical role in connecting the\natmosphere to the forces and processes contained within the magnetic field. For\nexample, auroral current systems can drive charged particles into the\natmosphere, heating it by way of Joule heating. Ground-based observations of\nH$_3^+$ provides a powerful remote diagnostic of the physical properties and\nprocesses that occur within the upper atmosphere, and a rich data set exists\nfor Uranus. These observations span almost three decades and have revealed that\nthe upper atmosphere has continuously cooled between 1992 and 2018 at about 8\nK/year, from $\\sim$750 K to $\\sim$500 K. The reason for this trend remain\nunclear, but could be related to seasonally driven changes in the Joule heating\nrates due to the tilted and offset magnetic field, or could be related to\nchanging vertical distributions of hydrocarbons. H$_3^+$ has not yet been\ndetected at Neptune, but this discovery provides low-hanging fruit for upcoming\nfacilities such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the next\ngeneration of 30 metre telescopes. Detecting H$_3^+$ at Neptune would enable\nthe characterisation of its upper atmosphere for the first time since 1989. To\nfully understand the ice giants we need dedicated orbital missions, in the same\nway the Cassini spacecraft explored Saturn.

We consider the problem of\naccurately predicting popularity both at any given prediction time since a\ncontent item's creation and for arbitrary time horizons into the future.

A\nkey challenge in resolving the number of absorbed photons in the microwave\nfrequency range is finding a suitable material that provides not only an\nappropriate band structure for absorbing low-energy photons but also a means of\ndetecting a discrete photoelectron excitation. To this end, we propose to\nmeasure the temperature gain after absorbing a photon using superconducting\ncadmium arsenide (Cd3As2) with a topological semimetallic surface state as the\ndetector. The surface electrons absorb the incoming photons and then transfer\nthe excess energy via heat to the superconducting bulk's phonon modes. The\ntemperature gain can be determined by measuring the change in the zero-bias\nbulk resistivity, which does not significantly affect the lattice dynamics.\nMoreover, the obtained temperature gain scales discretely with the number of\nabsorbed photons, enabling a photon-number resolving function. Here, we will\ncalculate the temperature increase as a function of the number and frequency of\nphotons absorbed.

The promise of\ndichromatic excitation is to spectrally isolate the excitation laser from the\nquantum emission, enabling background-free photon extraction from the emitter.\nParadoxically, we find that excitation is not possible without spectral overlap\nbetween the exciting pulse and the quantum emitter transition for ideal\ntwo-level systems due to cancellation of the accumulated pulse area. However,\nany additional interactions that interfere with cancellation of the accumulated\npulse area may lead to a finite stationary population inversion. Our\nspectroscopic results of a solid-state two-level system show that while\ncoupling to lattice vibrations helps to improve the inversion efficiency up to\n50\\% under symmetric driving, coherent population control and a larger amount\nof inversion are possible using asymmetric dichromatic excitation, which we\nachieve by adjusting the ratio of the intensities between the red and\nblue-detuned pulses.

Such\nbatch mode training of deep learning models suffers from low training\nefficiency, which may lead to performance degradation when the model is not\nproduced on time. To tackle this issue, incremental learning is proposed and\nhas received much attention recently. Incremental learning has great potential\nin recommender systems, as two consecutive window of training data overlap most\nof the volume. It aims to update the model incrementally with only the newly\nincoming samples from the timestamp when the model is updated last time, which\nis much more efficient than the batch mode training.

In this work we study jet suppression from small to very large\nradius, for low and very high energy jets at the LHC and RHIC. We use the\nhybrid strong/weak coupling model for jet quenching that combines perturbative\nshower evolution with an effective strongly coupled description of the energy\nand momentum transfer from the jet into the QGP. Because of energy-momentum\nconservation, the wake created by the jet enhances or depletes the yield of\nparticles generated at the freeze-out hypersurface depending on their\norientation with respect to the direction of the jet. We find that jet\nsuppression is remarkably independent of the anti-$k_T$ radius R, specially at\nLHC, first slightly increasing by opening R, then at larger values of R slowly\ndecreasing. This nearly independence of jet suppression with R arises from two\ncompeting effects, namely the larger energy loss of the energetic jet\ncomponents, which tends to increase suppression, against the partial recovery\nof the lost energy due to medium response, which reduces suppression. We find\nthat the boosted medium from the recoiling jet depletes the amount of QGP in\nthe direction opposite to it in the transverse plane, inducing energy loss due\nto an over-subtraction effect. We show that this unique signature of the\nhydrodynamization of part of the jet energy can be scrutinized by selecting\nsamples of dijet configurations with different relative rapidities between the\nleading and the subleading jet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Sep 2020 13:59:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-07"}

In this follow-up study, cross-section slices of coronal\nstrands are taken across the Hi-C 2.1 field-of-view. Following previous loop\nwidth studies, the background emission is removed to isolate the coronal\nstrands. The resulting intensity variations are reproduced by simultaneously\nfitting multiple Gaussian profiles using a non-linear least-squares curve\nfitting method. In total, 183 Gaussian profiles are examined for possible\nstructures that are hinted at in the data. The full width at half maximum\n(FWHM) is determined for each Gaussian, which are then collated and analysed.\nThe most frequent structural widths are $\\approx$450-575 km with 47% of the\nstrand widths beneath NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory Atmospheric Imaging\nAssembly (AIA) resolving scale (600-1000 km).

It is then further assumed that the\ncorresponding strain-energy function can be decomposed additively into\nvolumetric and deviatoric parts. We show that this decomposition is not\nphysically realistic, especially for anisotropic materials, which are of\nparticular interest for simulating the mechanical response of biological soft\ntissue. The most striking illustration of the shortcoming is that with this\ndecomposition, an anisotropic cube under hydrostatic tension deforms into\nanother cube instead of a hexahedron with non-parallel faces. Furthermore,\ncommercial numerical codes require the specification of a `compressibility\nparameter' (or `penalty factor'), which arises naturally from the flawed\nadditive decomposition of the strain-energy function. This parameter is often\nlinked to a `bulk modulus', although this notion makes no sense for anisotropic\nsolids; we show that it is essentially an arbitrary parameter and that\ninfinitesimal changes to it result in significant changes in the predicted\nstress response.

Finally, we test the presented scheme\nand compare the local controller performance against the LQR design as state of\nthe art approach. We demonstrate its effectiveness in a disturbed fast driving\nscenario being able to reject strong exogenous disturbances and fulfilling\nimposed constraints at a very reduced computational cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Sep 2020 15:27:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-07"}

The particles included in this study vary in size and material\nproperties: steel, polytetrafluorethylen (PTFE), polyoxymethylen (POM), or\nrubber. The corresponding terminal Reynolds numbers range from 333 to 4012,\ncovering in principle the transitional and Newton regime for drag forces. For\ncollision studies, the Stokes number just before impact is also relevant, and\nlies in the range 50 < St < 2250. The settling curves obtained experimentally\nare compared with numerical and analytical solutions. The latter has been\nderived on the basis of nominal terminal velocity and relaxation time for the\nStokes and Newton regimes. A deviation between experimental results and\nanalytical solution was observed in all cases where the terminal Reynolds\nnumber is larger than 300 and smaller than 1100. In this flow regime, the\nsettling process of the spheres is already affected at a long distance from the\nimpact object, leading to an early but significant deceleration. Moreover, a\nreduced settling velocity was observed along the whole trajectory for the PTFE\nparticles with the lowest terminal Reynolds number. All processed datasets are\navailable via the Mendeley Data repository. Two additional effects have been\nobserved during this study. First, a bright region was detected around all PTFE\nspheres. It finally was found to be due to total light reflection around the\nsphere, but, to the best of our knowledge, this peculiarity has never been\nreported before. Being purely optical, this does not effect the settling\nbehavior for PTFE. On the other hand, partial absorption of liquid at the\nparticle surface was observed for rubber, leading to a reduced sedimentation\nvelocity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Sep 2020 15:31:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-07"}

On the one hand, most of existing localization systems are\ndesigned for innocuous environments, where no malicious adversaries are\npresent. This makes them highly susceptible to security threats coming from\ninterferers, attacks or even unintentional errors (malfunctions) and thus,\npractically futile in hostile settings. On the other hand, existing secure\nlocalization solutions make certain (favorable) assumptions regarding the\nnetwork topology (e.g., that the target device lies within a convex hull formed\nby reference points), which restrict their applicability. Therefore, this work\naddresses the problem of target localization in randomly deployed wireless\nnetworks in the presence of malicious attackers, whose goal is to manipulate\n(spoof) the estimation process and disable accurate localization. We propose a\nlow-complex solution based on clustering and weighted central mass to detect\nattackers, using only the bare minimum of reference points, after which we\nsolve the localization problem by a bisection procedure.

CLEANN is\ndevised based on algorithm/hardware co-design and is equipped with specialized\nhardware to enable efficient real-time execution on resource-constrained\nembedded platforms. Proof of concept evaluations on CLEANN for the\nstate-of-the-art Neural Trojan attacks on visual benchmarks demonstrate its\ncompetitive advantage in terms of attack resiliency and execution overhead.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Sep 2020 05:29:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-08"}

We use an improved\nevolutionary model for radio galaxy lobes to estimate the observed parameters\nsuch as the radio luminosity and intensity of SZ-distortions at the redshifts\nof observation. We, further, quantify the effects of various relevant physical\nparameters of the radio galaxies, such as the jet power, the time scale over\nwhich the jet is active, the evolutionary time scale for the lobe, etc on the\nobserved parameters. For current SZ observations towards galaxy clusters, we\nfind that the non-thermal SZ distortions from radio lobes embedded in galaxy\nclusters can be non-negligible compared to the amount of thermal SZ distortion\nfrom the intra-cluster medium and, hence, can not be neglected.

These language models are typified by a\npre-training process on large unlabeled text corpora and subsequently\nfine-tuned for specific tasks. Although considerable work has been devoted to\nunderstanding the attention mechanisms of pre-trained models, it is less\nunderstood how a model's attention mechanisms change when trained for a target\nNLP task. In this paper, we propose a visual analytics approach to\nunderstanding fine-tuning in attention-based language models. Our\nvisualization, Attention Flows, is designed to support users in querying,\ntracing, and comparing attention within layers, across layers, and amongst\nattention heads in Transformer-based language models. To help users gain\ninsight on how a classification decision is made, our design is centered on\ndepicting classification-based attention at the deepest layer and how attention\nfrom prior layers flows throughout words in the input. Attention Flows supports\nthe analysis of a single model, as well as the visual comparison between\npre-trained and fine-tuned models via their similarities and differences. We\nuse Attention Flows to study attention mechanisms in various sentence\nunderstanding tasks and highlight how attention evolves to address the nuances\nof solving these tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Sep 2020 19:56:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-16"}

Both\neffects are new to the literature, found so far. Experimental results are\ngeneralized and reported qualitatively. Working principles of these effects are\nprovided within classical mechanics and found consistent with observations and\nsimulations. The effects are based on the interaction of a rigid and finite\ninertial body (an object having mass and moment of inertia) endowed with a\nmagnetic moment with a cyclic inhomogeneous magnetic field which does not\nrequire to have a local minimum. Such a body having some degrees of freedom\ninvolved in driven harmonic motion by this interaction can experience a net\nforce in the direction of the weak field regardless of its position and\norientation or can find stable equilibrium with the field itself autonomously.\nThe former is called polarity free magnetic repulsion and the latter magnetic\nbound state. Experiments show that a bound state can be obtained between two\nfree bodies having magnetic dipole moment. Various schemes of trapping bodies\nhaving magnetic moments by rotating fields are realized as well as rotating\nbodies trapped by a static dipole field in presence of gravity. Also, a special\ncase of bound state called bipolar bound state between free dipole bodies is\ninvestigated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Sep 2020 18:16:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-24"}

These\nwaves behave precisely opposite to the classical non-linear waves, with\ninverted classical waves like the expansion shocks which do not violate entropy\nconditions. More complex equation of state (EOS) other than the ideal or\nperfect EOS is typically used in describing dense gases. Algorithm development\nwith non-ideal/real gas EOS and application to dense gasses is gaining\nimportance from a numerical perspective. Extending the algorithms designed for\nperfect gas EOS to dense gas flows with arbitrary real gas EOS is non-trivial.\nMost of the algorithms designed for prefect gas EOS are modified significantly\nwhen applied to real gas EOS. These algorithms can become complicated and some\ntimes impossible based on the EOS under consideration.

Therefore, during the current Covid-19 pandemic the usage\nof face masks is strongly recommended by health officials. Although three-layer\nmasks are generally advised for usage, many commonly available or homemade\nmasks contain only single and double layers. In this study, we show through\ndetailed physics based analyses and high speed imaging that high momentum cough\ndroplets on impingement on single- and double-layer masks can lead to\nsignificant partial penetration and more importantly atomization into numerous\nmuch smaller daughter droplets, thereby increasing the total population of the\naerosol, which can remain suspended for a longer time. The possibility of\nsecondary atomization of high momentum cough droplets due to impingement,\nhydrodynamic focusing and extrusion through the microscale pores in the fibrous\nnetwork of the mask has not been explored before. However, this unique mode of\naerosol generation poses a finite risk of infection as shown in this work. We\nalso demonstrate that in single layer masks close to 70 % of a given droplet\nvolume is atomized and only 30 % is trapped within the fibers. The entrapped\nvolume is close to 90 % for double layer masks which still allows some\natomization into smaller droplets. We however found that a triple-layer\nsurgical mask permits negligible penetration and hence should be effective in\npreventing disease transmission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Sep 2020 08:18:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Oct 2020 02:07:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2020 03:42:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-24"}
