The amount of heat addition from the sphere\nencompasses both, the heating regime where the Boussinesq approximation holds\nand the regime where it breaks down. The particle is assumed to have a low Biot\nnumber which means that the particle is uniformly at the same temperature and\nhas no internal temperature gradients. Scaling buoyancy with inertial and\nviscous forces yields two related non-dimensional quantities, called Buoyancy\nInduced Viscous Reynolds Number ($Re_{BV}$) and Buoyancy Induced Inertial\nReynolds Number ($Re_{BI}$). For ideal gases, $Re_{BV}$ is analogous to the\nGrashof number ($Gr$). No assumptions are made on the magnitude of $Re_{BI}$\n(or equivalently $Re_{BV}$). The effects of the orientation of gravity relative\nto the free-stream velocity are examined. Large deviations in the value of the\ndrag coefficient are observed when the Froude number ($Fr$) decreases and/or\nthe temperature of the sphere increases. Under appropriate constraints on\n$Re_{BI}$ and $Re$, the total drag on a heated sphere in a low $Re$ flow in the\npresence of buoyancy (mixed convection) is shown to be, within 10% error, the\nlinear superposition of the drag computed in two canonical setups: one being\nthe drag on a steadily moving heated sphere in the absence of buoyancy (forced\nconvection) and the other being natural convection. However, the effect of\ntemperature variation on the drag of a sphere in both, forced and natural\nconvection, is significant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Sep 2020 16:10:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-22"}

Many cyber attacks rely on a lack of network-level\ninformation flow controls to successfully compromise a victim network. Once an\nadversary exploits an initial entry point, they can eavesdrop and move\nlaterally within the network (e.g., scan and penetrate internal nodes) to\nfurther their malicious goals. In this paper, we propose a novel multilevel\nsecurity (MLS) framework to enforce a secure inter-node information flow policy\nwithin the network and therein vastly reduce the attack surface available to an\nadversary who has penetrated it. In contrast to prior work on multilevel\nsecurity in computer networks which relied on enforcing the policy at network\nendpoints, we leverage the centralization of software-defined networks (SDNs)\nby moving the task to the controller and providing this service transparently\nto all nodes in the network. Our framework, MLSNet, formalizes the generation\nof a policy compliant network configuration (i.e., set of flow rules on the SDN\nswitches) as network optimization problems, with the objectives of (1)\nmaximizing the number of flows satisfying all security constraints and (2)\nminimizing the security cost of routing any remaining flows to guarantee\navailability. We demonstrate that MLSNet can securely route flows that satisfy\nthe security constraints (e.g., >80% of flows in a performed benchmark) and\nroute the remaining flows with a minimal security cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Sep 2020 16:55:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-22"}

A comparison of the stacked MUSE spectra of the two RCs shows the same\nmean Na abundance difference between the two populations.

Recently, the field known as fair machine learning has turned to\nJohn Rawls's theory of distributive justice for inspiration and\noperationalization. However, philosophers known as capability theorists have\nlong argued that Rawls's theory uses the wrong measure of justice, thereby\nencoding biases against people with disabilities. If these theorists are right,\nis it possible to operationalize Rawls's theory in machine learning systems\nwithout also encoding its biases? In this paper, I draw on examples from fair\nmachine learning to suggest that the answer to this question is no: the\ncapability theorists' arguments against Rawls's theory carry over into machine\nlearning systems. But capability theorists don't only argue that Rawls's theory\nuses the wrong measure, they also offer an alternative measure. Which measure\nof justice is right? And has fair machine learning been using the wrong one?\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Sep 2020 17:46:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Sep 2020 16:52:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-01"}

Such heterogeneity in the data collection process causes\ninhomogeneity or variation in intensity (brightness) and noise distribution.\nThese variations play a detrimental role in the performance of image\nregistration, segmentation and detection algorithms. Classical image\nregistration methods are computationally expensive but are able to handle these\nartifacts relatively better. However, deep learning-based techniques are shown\nto be computationally efficient for automated brain registration but are\nsensitive to the intensity variations. In this study, we investigate the effect\nof variation in intensity distribution among input image pairs for deep\nlearning-based image registration methods. We find a performance degradation of\nthese models when brain image pairs with different intensity distribution are\npresented even with similar structures. To overcome this limitation, we\nincorporate a structural similarity-based loss function in a deep neural\nnetwork and test its performance on the validation split separated before\ntraining as well as on a completely unseen new dataset. We report that the deep\nlearning models trained with structure similarity-based loss seems to perform\nbetter for both datasets.

Recent\nbreaches have exposed billions of user passwords to the dangerous threat of\noffline password cracking attacks. An offline attacker can quickly check\nmillions (or sometimes billions/trillions) of password guesses by comparing\ntheir hash value with the stolen hash from a breached authentication server.\nThe attacker is limited only by the resources he is willing to invest. Our key\nidea is to have the authentication server store a (noisy) signal about the\nstrength of each user password for an offline attacker to find. Surprisingly,\nwe show that the noise distribution for the signal can often be tuned so that a\nrational (profit-maximizing) attacker will crack fewer passwords. The signaling\nscheme exploits the fact that password cracking is not a zero-sum game i.e.,\nthe attacker's profit is given by the value of the cracked passwords minus the\ntotal guessing cost. Thus, a well-defined signaling strategy will encourage the\nattacker to reduce his guessing costs by cracking fewer passwords. We use an\nevolutionary algorithm to compute the optimal signaling scheme for the\ndefender. As a proof-of-concept, we evaluate our mechanism on several password\ndatasets and show that it can reduce the total number of cracked passwords by\nup to $12\\%$ (resp. $5\\%$) of all users in defending against offline (resp.\nonline) attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Sep 2020 17:51:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Sep 2020 02:50:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 8 Mar 2021 20:43:41 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 30 Jul 2021 21:23:19 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 16 Aug 2021 15:21:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-17"}

The core findings\npresented in this thesis (now over a decade old) including that (i) logic\noperations (gates) can be embedded into the low-energy sector of Ising spins\nwhereas three (and higher) body Ising interaction terms can be mimicked through\nthe minimisation of 2- and 1-body Ising terms yet require the introduction of\nslack spins; (ii) Perturbation theory gadgets enable the emulation of\ninteractions not present in a given Hamiltonian, e.g.~$YY$ interactions can be\nrealized from $ZZ$, $XX$, the thesis contains a result from 2007 showing that\nphysically relevant two-body model Hamiltonian's have a QMA-hard ground state\nenergy decision problem. Merged with other results, this established that these\nmodels provide a universal resource for ground state quantum computation. More\nrecent findings include the proof that an idealised version of the contemporary\nvariational approach to quantum algorithms enables a universal model of quantum\ncomputation. Other related results are also presented as they relate to ground\nstate quantum computation and the minimisation of Hamiltonians by quantum\ncircuits. The topics covered include: Ising model reductions, stochastic versus\nquantum processes on graphs, quantum gates and circuits as tensor networks,\nvariational quantum algorithms and Hamiltonian gadgets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Sep 2020 18:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Dec 2021 13:38:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-28"}

Focusing on a family of\ninteracting, Floquet spin chains, we consider a Keldysh path-integral\ndescription of the dynamics. The central object in our approach is the\ninfluence matrix (IM), which describes the effect of the system on the dynamics\nof a local subsystem. For translationally invariant models, we formulate a\nself-consistency equation for the influence matrix. For certain special values\nof the model parameters, we obtain an exact solution which represents a perfect\ndephaser (PD). Physically, a PD corresponds to a many-body system that acts as\na perfectly Markovian bath on itself: at each period, it measures every spin.\nFor the models considered here, we establish that PD points include\ndual-unitary circuits investigated in recent works. In the vicinity of PD\npoints, the system is not perfectly Markovian, but rather acts as a bath with a\nshort memory time. In this case, we demonstrate that the self-consistency\nequation can be solved using matrix-product states (MPS) methods, as the IM\ntemporal entanglement is low. A combination of analytical insights and MPS\ncomputations allows us to characterize the structure of the influence matrix in\nterms of an effective \"statistical-mechanics\" description. We finally\nillustrate the predictive power of this description by analytically computing\nhow quickly an embedded impurity spin thermalizes. The influence matrix\napproach formulated here provides an intuitive view of the quantum many-body\ndynamics problem, opening a path to constructing models of thermalizing\ndynamics that are solvable or can be efficiently treated by MPS-based methods,\nand to further characterizing quantum ergodicity or lack thereof.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Sep 2020 18:04:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2021 23:25:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-26"}

One way to assess the\nrelationship between signals from different brain regions is to measure their\nphase synchronization (PS) across time. There are several ways to perform such\nanalyses, and here we compare methods that utilize a PS metric together with a\nsliding window, referred to here as windowed phase synchronization (WPS), with\nthose that directly measure the instantaneous phase synchronization (IPS). In\nparticular, IPS has recently gained popularity as it offers single time-point\nresolution of time-resolved fMRI connectivity. In this paper, we discuss the\nunderlying assumptions required for performing PS analyses and emphasize the\nnecessity of band-pass filtering the data to obtain valid results. We review\nvarious methods for evaluating PS and introduce a new approach within the IPS\nframework denoted the cosine of the relative phase (CRP). We contrast methods\nthrough a series of simulations and application to rs-fMRI data. Our results\nindicate that CRP outperforms other tested methods and overcomes issues related\nto undetected temporal transitions from positive to negative associations\ncommon in IPS analysis. Further, in contrast to phase coherence, CRP unfolds\nthe distribution of PS measures, which benefits subsequent clustering of PS\nmatrices into recurring brain states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Sep 2020 18:38:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-23"}

This paper studies the case of spurious class skew in\nwhich patients with a particular attribute are spuriously more likely to have\nthe outcome of interest. For instance, clinical protocols might lead to a\ndataset in which patients with pacemakers are disproportionately likely to have\ncongestive heart failure. This skew can lead to models that take shortcuts by\nheavily relying on the biased attribute. We explore this problem across a\nnumber of attributes in the context of diagnosing the cause of acute hypoxemic\nrespiratory failure. Applied to chest X-rays, we show that i) deep nets can\naccurately identify many patient attributes including sex (AUROC = 0.96) and\nage (AUROC >= 0.90), ii) they tend to exploit correlations between such\nattributes and the outcome label when learning to predict a diagnosis, leading\nto poor performance when such correlations do not hold in the test population\n(e.g., everyone in the test set is male), and iii) a simple transfer learning\napproach is surprisingly effective at preventing the shortcut and promoting\ngood generalization performance. On the task of diagnosing congestive heart\nfailure based on a set of chest X-rays skewed towards older patients (age >=\n63), the proposed approach improves generalization over standard training from\n0.66 (95% CI: 0.54-0.77) to 0.84 (95% CI: 0.73-0.92) AUROC.

This is causing the speeding up (acceleration) of the\nexpansion of the Universe over the past 6 billion years, a discovery recognised\nby the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics. Coupled with the flatness of the Universe\nand the amount of 30% matter (5% baryonic and 25% Cold Dark Matter), this forms\nthe so-called Lambda-CDM standard model, which has survived many observational\ntests over about 30 years. However, there are currently indications of\ninconsistencies (`tensions' ) within Lambda-CDM on different values of the\nHubble Constant and the clumpiness factor. Also, time variation of Dark Energy\nand slight deviations from General Relativity are not ruled out yet. Several\ngrand projects are underway to test Lambda-CDM further and to estimate the\ncosmological parameters to sub-percent level. If Lambda-CDM will remain the\nstandard model, then the ball is back in the theoreticians' court, to explain\nthe physical meaning of Lambda.

Interest and demand for decarbonization\nand energy democratization is resulting in growing penetration of controllable\nenergy resources. In turn, this process is increasing the number of grid\nentities. The paradigm shift is also fueled by increased adoption of\nintelligent sensors and actuators equipped with advanced processing and\ncomputing capabilities. While collaboration among power grid entities (agents)\nreduces energy cost and increases overall reliability, achieving effective\ncollaboration is challenging. The main challenges stem from the heterogeneity\nof system agents and their collected information. Furthermore, the scale of\ndata collection is constantly increasing and many grid entities have strict\nprivacy requirements. Another challenge is the energy industry's common\npractice of keeping data in silos. Federated computation is an approach well\nsuited to addressing these issues that are increasingly important for\nmulti-agent energy systems. Through federated computation, agents\ncollaboratively solve learning and optimization problems while respecting each\nagent's privacy and overcoming barriers of cross-device and cross-organization\ndata isolation.

Finally, using the events in\nGWTC-1 as standard sirens, we infer an astrophysically-informed improvement on\nthe estimate of the calibration error in the LIGO interferometers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Sep 2020 22:00:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-04"}

However, very\nlitter work has been done about Graph Neural Networks (GNN) learning on\nunstructured network data. Given the huge number of choices and combinations of\ncomponents such as aggregator and activation function, determining the suitable\nGNN structure for a specific problem normally necessitates tremendous expert\nknowledge and laborious trails.

In this paper, we propose a novel AutoML framework\nthrough the evolution of individual models in a large GNN architecture space\ninvolving both neural structures and learning parameters. Instead of optimizing\nonly the model structures with fixed parameter settings as existing work, an\nalternating evolution process is performed between GNN structures and learning\nparameters to dynamically find the best fit of each other.

A number of\npast research results have demonstrated how malicious actors can use hidden\ncommands to get VAs to perform certain operations even when a person may be in\ntheir vicinity. However, such work has not explored how compromised computers\nthat are close to VAs can leverage the phone channel to exfiltrate data with\nthe help of VAs. After characterizing the communication channel that is set up\nby commanding a VA to make a call to a phone number, we demonstrate how malware\ncan encode data into audio and send it via the phone channel. Such an attack,\nwhich can be crafted remotely, at scale and at low cost, can be used to bypass\nnetwork defenses that may be deployed against leakage of sensitive data. We use\nDual-Tone Multi-Frequency tones to encode arbitrary binary data into audio that\ncan be played over computer speakers and sent through a VA mediated phone\nchannel to a remote system. We show that modest amounts of data can be\ntransmitted with high accuracy with a short phone call lasting a few minutes.\nThis can be done while making the audio nearly inaudible for most people by\nmodulating it with a carrier with frequencies that are near the higher end of\nthe human hearing range. Several factors influence the data transfer rate,\nincluding the distance between the computer and the VA, the ambient noise that\nmay be present and the frequency of modulating carrier. With the help of a\nprototype built by us, we experimentally assess the impact of these factors on\ndata transfer rates and transmission accuracy.

Their exotic properties arise from exceptional point (EP)\ndegeneracies of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians that govern their dynamics. In\nrecent years, increasingly sophisticated models of $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric\nsystems with time-periodic (Floquet) driving, time-periodic gain and loss, and\ntime-delayed coupling have been investigated, and such systems have been\nrealized across numerous platforms comprising optics, acoustics, mechanical\noscillators, optomechanics, and electrical circuits. Here, we introduce a\n$\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric (balanced gain and loss) system with memory, and\ninvestigate its dynamics analytically and numerically. Our model consists of\ntwo coupled $LC$ oscillators with positive and negative resistance,\nrespectively. We introduce memory by replacing either the resistor with a\nmemristor, or the coupling inductor with a meminductor, and investigate the\ncircuit energy dynamics as characterized by $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric or\n$\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry broken phases. Due to the resulting nonlinearity, we\nfind that energy dynamics depend on the sign and strength of initial voltages\nand currents, as well as the distribution of initial circuit energy across its\ndifferent components. Surprisingly, at strong inputs, the system exhibits\nself-organized Floquet dynamics, including $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetry broken phase\nat vanishingly small dissipation strength. Our results indicate that\n$\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric systems with memory show a rich landscape.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Sep 2020 23:04:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-17"}

We\nexplore here a calibration method that uses astronomical signals, namely\ninspiral signals from compact-object binaries, and we show that it can in\nprinciple enable calibration at the sub-1\\% accuracy levels needed for future\ngravitational wave science. We show how ensembles of these transient events can\nbe used to measure the calibration errors of individual detectors in a network\nof three or more comparably sensitive instruments. As with telescopes, relative\ncalibration of gravitational-wave detectors using detected events is easier to\nachieve than absolute calibration, which in principle would still need to be\ndone with a hardware method for at least one detector at one frequency. Our\nproposed method uses the so-called null streams, the signal-free linear\ncombinations of the outputs of the detectors that exist in any network with\nthree or more differently oriented detectors. Signals do not appear in the null\nstream if the signal amplitude in the detector output is faithful to that of\nthe real signal. Frequency-dependent calibration errors and relative\ncalibration and timing errors between detectors leave a residual in the null\nstream. The amount of residual from each detector depends on the source\ndirection. We adapt the method of matched filtering to the problem of\nextracting the calibration error of each detector from this residual. This\nrequires combining linearly the filter outputs of a sufficient number of\ndetected signals, and in principle it can achieve any desired accuracy in a\nlong enough observation run. We anticipate that A+ detector networks, expected\nin 5 years, could employ this method to check anticipated hardware calibration\naccuracies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Sep 2020 23:05:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-23"}

We address this\nchallenge by formulating CPS design as a multi-objective optimization problem\nand propose DISPATCH, a two-step methodology for sample-efficient search over\nthe design space. First, we use a genetic algorithm to search over discrete\nchoices of system component values for architecture search and component\nselection or only component selection and terminate the algorithm even before\nmeeting the system requirements, thus yielding a coarse design. In the second\nstep, we use an inverse design to search over a continuous space to fine-tune\nthe component values and meet the diverse set of system requirements. We use a\nneural network as a surrogate function for the inverse design of the system.\nThe neural network, converted into a mixed-integer linear program, is used for\nactive learning to sample component values efficiently in a continuous search\nspace. We illustrate the efficacy of DISPATCH on electrical circuit benchmarks:\ntwo-stage and three-stage transimpedence amplifiers.

Consequently, there is\nan unaddressed need for a rapid imaging technique to guide maximal resection of\nbrain tumors. Working towards this goal, presented here is an all optical\nnon-contact label-free reflection mode photoacoustic remote sensing (PARS)\nmicroscope. By using a tunable excitation laser, PARS takes advantage of the\nendogenous optical absorption peaks of DNA and cytoplasm to achieve virtual\ncontrast analogous to standard hematoxylin and eosin (H and E) staining. In\nconjunction, a fast 266 nm excitation is used to generate large grossing scans\nand rapidly assess small fields in real-time with hematoxylin-like contrast.\nImages obtained using this technique show comparable quality and contrast to\nthe current standard for histopathological assessment of brain tissues. Using\nthe proposed method, rapid, high-throughput, histological-like imaging was\nachieved in unstained brain tissues, indicating PARS utility for intraoperative\nguidance to improve extent of surgical resection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Sep 2020 23:57:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-23"}

It is interestingly found that duration ($T_{90}$)\ndistribution of \\textit{Swift} bursts still exhibits an evident bimodality with\na more reliable boundary of $T_{90}\\simeq$1.06 s instead of 2 s for previously\ncontaminated samples including bursts without well-peaked spectra, which is\nvery close to $\\sim$1.27 s and $\\sim$0.8 s suggested by some authors for\nFermi/GBM and \\textit{Swift}/BAT catalogs, respectively. The \\textit{Swift}/BAT\nshort and long bursts have comparable mean $E_{\\text p}$ values of\n$87^{+112}_{-49}$ and $85^{+101}_{-46}$ keV in each, similar to what found for\nboth types of BATSE bursts, which manifests the traditional\nshort-hard/long-soft scheme may not be tenable for the certain energy window of\na detector. In statistics, we also investigate the consistency of distinct\nmethods for the $E_{\\text p}$ estimates and find that Bayesian approach and\nBAND function can always give consistent evaluations. In contrast, the\nfrequently-used cut-off power-law model matches two other methods for lower\n$E_{\\text p}$ and will overestimate the $E_{\\text p}$ more than 70\\% as\n$E_{\\text p}>$100 keV. Peak energies of X-ray flashes, X-ray rich bursts and\nclassical gamma-ray bursts could have an evolutionary consequence from\nthermal-dominated to non-thermal-dominated radiation mechanisms. Finally, we\nfind that the $E_{\\text p}$ and the observed fluence ($S_{\\gamma}$) in the\nobserver frame are correlated as $E_p\\simeq [S_{\\gamma}/(10^{-5} erg\\\ncm^{-2})]^{0.28}\\times 117.5^{+44.7}_{-32.4}$ keV proposed to be an useful\nindicator of GRB peak energies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Sep 2020 01:00:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-30"}

This rule relates the\nthickness of the stem with the thickness of the branches at different\nbifurcation stages in a Pythagorean fashion. He argued that his rule was the\nresult of the conservation of sap flux. In the present work, we explore this\nidea by assuming that the sap flux through each xylem element behaves as a\nnon-ideal fluid and the size-distribution of the xylem elements obeys a power\nlaw distribution. We find that the simultaneous fulfillment of Leonardo's rule\nand the conservation of the sap flux, lead to a global behavior of the sap like\nthat of an ideal fluid after summing over all xylem elements. These results are\nsupported by field and experimental work. In particular, we corroborated the\nLeonardo's rule in different tree species by measuring the stem-branches\nthickness at different bifurcations stages. We also determined the statistical\nsize-distribution of the xylem elements through a maceration process, finding\nthat it corresponds to a power law distribution with an exponent close to\nthree, which is the exponent required for the Leonardo's rule. As far as we\nknow this is the first time that a statistical hydraulic model supported by\nexperimental data is presented for the Leonardo's rule.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Sep 2020 04:29:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-23"}

However, the quality of the annotations often varies among\nlabelers. Multi-observer studies have been conducted to study these annotation\nvariances (by labeling the same data for multiple times) and its effects on\ncritical applications like medical image analysis. This process indeed adds an\nextra burden to the already tedious annotation work that usually requires\nprofessional training and expertise in the specific domains. On the other hand,\nautomated annotation methods based on NLP algorithms have recently shown\npromise as a reasonable alternative, relying on the existing diagnostic reports\nof those images that are widely available in the clinical system. Compared to\nhuman labelers, different algorithms provide labels with varying qualities that\nare even noisier. In this paper, we show how noisy annotations (e.g., from\ndifferent algorithm-based labelers) can be utilized together and mutually\nbenefit the learning of classification tasks.

After a comprehensive analysis on light curves,\ntime-integrated, and time-resolved spectral properties of these FRB-absent\nX-ray bursts, we compare this sample with the FRB-associated X-ray burst\ndetected by Insight-HXMT, INTEGRAL, and Konus-Wind. The FRB-associated burst\ndistinguishes itself from other X-ray bursts by its nonthermal spectrum and a\nhigher spectral peak energy, but otherwise is not atypical. We also compare the\ncumulative energy distribution of our X-ray burst sample with that of first\nrepeating FRB source, FRB 121102, with the calibration of FRB 200428-X-ray\nburst association. We find a similarity between the two, offering indirect\nsupport of the magnetar origin of cosmological FRBs. The event rate density of\nmagnetar bursts is about $\\sim 150$ times higher than the FRB event rate\ndensity at the energy of FRB 200428. This again suggests that, if all FRBs\noriginate from magnetars, only a small fraction of X-ray bursts are associated\nwith FRBs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Sep 2020 06:34:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 2021 14:22:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-15"}

With the trained models, one is enabled to\nquantitatively investigate the biased effect shown by a void/bubble being a\npoint defect sink, and the results are compared with existing ones over\nwell-studied scenarios. Moreover, the faster diffusive mechanisms on\ncrystalline interfaces are distinguishingly modelled by locally planar rate\nequations, and their linkages with rate equations for bulk diffusion are\nformulated through derivative jumps of point defect concentrations across the\ninterfaces. Thus the distinctive role of crystalline interfaces as partial\nsinks and quick diffusive channels can be investigated. Methodologicalwise, the\npresent treatment is also applicable for studying more complicated situation of\nlong-term sink behaviour observed in irradiated materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Sep 2020 06:42:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}

In these 658 flares, we find that there are 505 (76.8\\%) type I\nflares, 10 (1.5\\%) type II flares, and 143 (21.7\\%) type III flares, and that\nthe three types appear to have no dependence on the flare duration, flare\nlocation, or solar cycle. Besides the main peak, the \\lya\\ emission of the\nthree type flares also shows sub-peaks which can appear in the impulsive or\ngradual phase of the flare. It is found that the main-peak (for type I) and\nsub-peak (for type III) emissions of \\lya\\ that appear in the impulsive phase\nfollow the Neupert effect in general. This indicates that such \\lya\\ emissions\nare related to the nonthermal electron beam heating. While the main-peak (for\ntype III) and sub-peak (for type I) emissions of \\lya\\ that appear in the\ngradual phase are supposed to be primarily contributed by the thermal plasma\nthat cools down.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Sep 2020 07:27:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-25"}

It is often solved either with tedious manual work or\nmotion capture based techniques that require specialised and costly hardware.\nExample based animation approaches circumvent these problems by re-using\ncaptured data of real people. This data is split into short motion samples that\ncan be looped or concatenated in order to create novel motion sequences. The\nobvious advantages of this approach are the simplicity of use and the high\nrealism, since the data exhibits only real deformations. Rather than tuning\nweights of a complex face rig, the animation task is performed on a higher\nlevel by arranging typical motion samples in a way such that the desired facial\nperformance is achieved. Two difficulties with example based approaches,\nhowever, are high memory requirements as well as the creation of artefact-free\nand realistic transitions between motion samples. We solve these problems by\ncombining the realism and simplicity of example-based animations with the\nadvantages of neural face models. Our neural face model is capable of\nsynthesising high quality 3D face geometry and texture according to a compact\nlatent parameter vector. This latent representation reduces memory requirements\nby a factor of 100 and helps creating seamless transitions between concatenated\nmotion samples. In this paper, we present a marker-less approach for facial\nmotion capture based on multi-view video. Based on the captured data, we learn\na neural representation of facial expressions, which is used to seamlessly\nconcatenate facial performances during the animation procedure. We demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our approach by synthesising mouthings for Swiss-German\nsign language based on viseme query sequences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Sep 2020 07:35:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-13"}

In this paper, we\ntackle the problem from a new perspective based on the equivalence of three\nconstrained optimization problems: the network embedding problem, the trace\nmaximization problem of the modularity matrix in a sampled graph, and the\nmatrix factorization problem of the modularity matrix in a sampled graph. The\noptimal solutions to these three problems are the dominant eigenvectors of the\nmodularity matrix. We proposed two algorithms that belong to a special class of\ngraph convolutional networks (GCNs) for solving these problems: (i) Clustering\nAs Feature Embedding GCN (CAFE-GCN) and (ii) sphere-GCN. Both algorithms are\nstable trace maximization algorithms, and they yield good approximations of\ndominant eigenvectors. Moreover, there are linear-time implementations for\nsparse graphs. In addition to solving the network embedding problem, both\nproposed GCNs are capable of performing dimensionality reduction.

The\noutput unfortunately could consist of a large number of maximal cliques. In\nthis paper, we study how to report a summary of less overlapping maximal\ncliques. The problem was studied before, however, after examining the pioneer\napproach, we consider it still not satisfactory. To advance the research along\nthis line, our paper attempts to make four contributions: (a) we propose a more\neffective sampling strategy, which produces a much smaller summary but still\nensures that the summary can somehow witness all the maximal cliques and the\nexpectation of each maximal clique witnessed by the summary is above a\npredefined threshold; (b) we prove that the sampling strategy is optimal under\ncertain optimality conditions; (c) we apply clique-size bounding and design new\nenumeration order to approach the optimality conditions; and (d) to verify\nexperimentally, we test eight real benchmark datasets that have a variety of\ngraph characteristics.

The trails consist predominantly of\ncometary particles with sizes of approximately 0.1 mm to 1 cm which are ejected\nat low speeds and remain very close to the comet orbit for several revolutions\naround the Sun. When re-analysing the Helios dust data measured in the 1970s,\nAltobelli et al. (2006) recognized a clustering of seven impacts, detected in a\nvery narrow region of space at a true anomaly angle of 135 deg, which the\nauthors considered as potential cometary trail particles. We re-analyse these\ncandidate cometary trail particles to investigate the possibility that some or\nall of them indeed originate from cometary trails and we constrain their source\ncomets. The Interplanetary Meteoroid Environment for eXploration (IMEX) dust\nstreams in space model is a new universal model for cometary meteoroid streams\nin the inner solar system, developed by Soja et al. (2015). Using IMEX we study\ncometary trail traverses by Helios. During ten revolutions around the Sun, and\nin the narrow region of space where Helios detected the candidate dust\nparticles, the spacecraft repeatedly traversed the trails of comets\n45P/Honda-Mrkos-Pajduvsakova and 72P/Denning-Fujikawa. Based on the detection\ntimes and particle impact directions, four detected particles are compatible\nwith an origin from these two comets. We find a dust spatial density in these\ntrails of about 10^-8 to 10^-7 m^-3. The in-situ detection and analysis of\nmeteoroid trail particles which can be traced back to their source bodies by\nspacecraft-based dust analysers opens a new window to remote compositional\nanalysis of comets and asteroids without the necessity to fly a spacecraft to\nor even land on those celestial bodies. This provides new science opportunities\nfor future missions like Destiny+, Europa Clipper and IMAP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Sep 2020 08:09:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-18"}

Federated\nlearning is an emerging privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm that\nproduces an unbiased global model based on the received updates of local models\ntrained by clients without exchanging clients' local data. Nevertheless, the\ndefault setting of federated learning introduces huge communication cost of\ntransferring model updates and can hardly ensure model performance when data\nheterogeneity of clients heavily exists. To improve communication efficiency\nand model performance, in this paper, we propose a novel dynamic fusion-based\nfederated learning approach for medical diagnostic image analysis to detect\nCOVID-19 infections.

It is crucially this electron spin\nselection that forces, through demonic feedback and control, charge current to\nflow against the built-in potential barrier.

In addition, in order to achieve\nfusion temperatures modern tokamaks rely on auxiliary heating methods. These\nmethods generate pressure anisotropy in the plasma. For incompressible rotation\nwith pressure anisotropy the equilibrium is governed by a Generalized\nGrad-Shafranov (GGS) equation and a decoupled Bernoulli-type equation for the\neffective pressure, $\\bar{p}=(p_\\parallel+p_\\perp)/2$, where $p_\\parallel$\n($p_\\perp$) is the pressure tensor element parallel (perpendicular) to the\nmagnetic field. In the case of plasma rotation parallel to the magnetic field\nthe GGS equation can be transformed to one equation identical in form with the\nGS equation. In this study by making use of the aforementioned property of the\nGGS equation for parallel plasma rotation we have constructed ITER-like\nnumerical equilibria by extending HELENA, an equilibrium fixed-boundary solver\nand examined the impact of rotation and anisotropy on certain equilibrium\nquantities. The main conclusions are that the addition of pressure anisotropy\nto rotation allows the profile shaping of the equilibrium quantities in much\nmore extent thus favouring the confinement and allows extension of the\nparametric space of the Mach number corresponding to higher values.\nFurthermore, the impact of pressure anisotropy in the equilibrium quantities is\nstronger than that of the rotation, for most of the quantities examined. For\nthe pressure components the impact of the pressure anisotropy is the same\nregardless of whether the power is deposited parallel or perpendicular to the\nmagnetic surfaces, thus implying that there is no preferable heating direction,\nwhile for the current density, the heating parallel to the magnetic surfaces\nseems to be beneficial for the current-gradient driven instabilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Sep 2020 09:48:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-23"}

In this work, we formulate DST as a sequence\ngeneration problem and propose a novel dual-learning framework to make full use\nof unlabeled data. In the dual-learning framework, there are two agents: the\nprimal tracker agent (utterance-to-state generator) and the dual utterance\ngenerator agent (state-to-utterance genera-tor). Compared with traditional\nsupervised learning framework, dual learning can iteratively update both agents\nthrough the reconstruction error and reward signal respectively without labeled\ndata. Reward sparsity problem is hard to solve in previous DST methods. In this\nwork, the reformulation of DST as a sequence generation model effectively\nalleviates this problem. We call this primal tracker agent dual-DST.\nExperimental results on MultiWOZ2.1 dataset show that the proposed dual-DST\nworks very well, especially when labelled data is limited.

The challenges of this task include 1) the requirement of\nlocalizing the relevant moment in an untrimmed video, and 2) bridging the\nsemantic gap between textual query and video contents. To tackle those\nproblems, early approaches adopt the sliding window or uniform sampling to\ncollect video clips first and then match each clip with the query. Obviously,\nthese strategies are time-consuming and often lead to unsatisfied accuracy in\nlocalization due to the unpredictable length of the golden moment. To avoid the\nlimitations, researchers recently attempt to directly predict the relevant\nmoment boundaries without the requirement to generate video clips first. One\nmainstream approach is to generate a multimodal feature vector for the target\nquery and video frames (e.g., concatenation) and then use a regression approach\nupon the multimodal feature vector for boundary detection. Although some\nprogress has been achieved by this approach, we argue that those methods have\nnot well captured the cross-modal interactions between the query and video\nframes.\n  In this paper, we propose an Attentive Cross-modal Relevance Matching (ACRM)\nmodel which predicts the temporal boundaries based on an interaction modeling.\nIn addition, an attention module is introduced to assign higher weights to\nquery words with richer semantic cues, which are considered to be more\nimportant for finding relevant video contents. Another contribution is that we\npropose an additional predictor to utilize the internal frames in the model\ntraining to improve the localization accuracy.

This can be\ncomputationally challenging in settings in which the temporal horizon between\nsubsequent observations is large, due to the poor scaling of algorithms for\nsimulating bridges as observation distance increases. It is common in practical\nsettings to use a blocking scheme, in which the path is split into a\n(user-specified) number of overlapping segments and a Gibbs sampler is employed\nto update segments in turn. Substituting the independent simulation of\ndiffusion bridges for one obtained using blocking introduces an inherent\ntrade-off: we are now imputing shorter bridges at the cost of introducing a\ndependency between subsequent iterations of the bridge sampler. This is further\ncomplicated by the fact that there are a number of possible ways to implement\nthe blocking scheme, each of which introduces a different dependency structure\nbetween iterations. Although blocking schemes have had considerable empirical\nsuccess in practice, there has been no analysis of this trade-off nor guidance\nto practitioners on the particular specifications that should be used to obtain\na computationally efficient implementation.

However, real diodes have a junction\nbarrier that electrons have to overcome and thus they have a threshold voltage\n$V_T$, which must be supplied to the diode to turn it on. This threshold\nvoltage gives rise to power dissipation in the form of heat and hence is an\nundesirable feature. In this work, based on half-metallic magnets and\nspin-gapless semiconductors we propose a diode concept that does not have a\njunction barrier and the operation principle of which relies on the\nspin-dependent transport properties of the HMM and SGS materials. We show that\nthe HMM and SGS materials form an Ohmic contact under any finite forward bias,\nwhile for a reverse bias the current is blocked due to spin-dependent filtering\nof the electrons. Thus, the HMM-SGS junctions act as a diode with zero\nthreshold voltage $V_T$, and linear $I-V$ characteristics as well as an\ninfinite on:off ratio at zero temperature. However, at finite temperatures,\nnon-spin-flip thermally excited high-energy electrons as well as low-energy\nspin-flip excitations can give rise to a leakage current and thus reduce the\non:off ratio under a reverse bias. Furthermore, a zero threshold voltage allows\none to detect extremely weak signals and due to the Ohmic HMM-SGS contact, the\nproposed diode has a much higher current drive capability and low resistance,\nwhich is advantageous compared to conventional semiconductor diodes.

Although moments of their velocity distribution\nfunctions help in distinguishing different plasma regimes, the distribution\nfunctions themselves provide more comprehensive information about the plasma\nstate, especially at times when the distribution function includes non-thermal\neffects. Unlike moments, however, distribution functions are not easily\ncharacterised by a small number of parameters, making their classification more\ndifficult to achieve. In order to perform this classification, we propose to\ndistinguish between the different plasma regions by applying dimensionality\nreduction and clustering methods to electron distributions in pitch angle and\nenergy space. We utilise four separate algorithms to achieve our plasma\nclassifications: autoencoders, principal component analysis, mean shift, and\nagglomerative clustering. We test our classification algorithms by applying our\nscheme to data from the Cluster-PEACE instrument measured in the Earth's\nmagnetotail.

Starting with the ECLAT database with associated\nclassifications based on the plasma parameters, we identify 8 distinct groups\nof distributions, that are dependent upon significantly more complex plasma and\nfield dynamics. By comparing the average distributions as well as the plasma\nand magnetic field parameters for each region, we relate several of the groups\nto different plasma sheet populations, and the rest we attribute to the plasma\nsheet boundary layer and the lobes.

It\nhas been widely thought that a small charge separation induced by the radiation\nforce generates electric field inside the shock that decelerates the ions. In\nthis paper we argue that, while this is true in sub-relativistic shocks which\nare devoid of positrons, in relativistic radiation mediated shocks (RRMS),\nwhich are dominated by newly created $e^+e^-$ pairs, additional coupling is\nneeded, owing to the opposite electric force acting on electrons and positrons.\nSpecifically, we show that dissipation of the ions energy must involve\ncollective plasma interactions.

In a ring with one lead, even electrons emitted\nfrom completely degenerate levels can be separated in time if the driving\npotential changes at the appropriate rate. In a ring with two leads, electrons\ncan be emitted to different leads if one of the leads has a bound state with\nFermi energy at its end.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Sep 2020 12:43:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-03"}

Consequently, the PRad result is in direct conflict with all modern\nelectron scattering experiments.

We\npresent a framework for natural language semantics in which words, phrases and\nsentences are all represented as vectors, based on a theoretical analysis which\nassumes that meaning is determined by context.\n  In the theoretical analysis, we define a corpus model as a mathematical\nabstraction of a text corpus. The meaning of a string of words is assumed to be\na vector representing the contexts it occurs in in the corpus model. Based on\nthis assumption, we can show that the vector representations of words can be\nconsidered as elements of an algebra over a field. We note that in applications\nof vector spaces to representing meanings of words there is an underlying\nlattice structure; we interpret the partial ordering of the lattice as\ndescribing entailment between meanings. We also define the context-theoretic\nprobability of a string, and, based on this and the lattice structure, a degree\nof entailment between strings.\n  Together these properties form guidelines as to how to construct semantic\nrepresentations within the framework. A context theory is an implementation of\nthe framework; in an implementation strings are represented as vectors with the\nproperties deduced from the theoretical analysis.\n  We show how to incorporate logical semantics into context theories; this\nenables us to represent statistical information about uncertainty by taking\nweighted sums of individual representations.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved\nstate-of-the-art performance for automatic medical image segmentation. However,\nthey are still challenged by complicated conditions where the segmentation\ntarget has large variations of position, shape and scale, and existing CNNs\nhave a poor explainability that limits their application to clinical decisions.\nIn this work, we make extensive use of multiple attentions in a CNN\narchitecture and propose a comprehensive attention-based CNN (CA-Net) for more\naccurate and explainable medical image segmentation that is aware of the most\nimportant spatial positions, channels and scales at the same time. In\nparticular, we first propose a joint spatial attention module to make the\nnetwork focus more on the foreground region. Then, a novel channel attention\nmodule is proposed to adaptively recalibrate channel-wise feature responses and\nhighlight the most relevant feature channels. Also, we propose a scale\nattention module implicitly emphasizing the most salient feature maps among\nmultiple scales so that the CNN is adaptive to the size of an object. Extensive\nexperiments on skin lesion segmentation from ISIC 2018 and multi-class\nsegmentation of fetal MRI found that our proposed CA-Net significantly improved\nthe average segmentation Dice score from 87.77% to 92.08% for skin lesion,\n84.79% to 87.08% for the placenta and 93.20% to 95.88% for the fetal brain\nrespectively compared with U-Net. It reduced the model size to around 15 times\nsmaller with close or even better accuracy compared with state-of-the-art\nDeepLabv3+.

Empirical data from the boats near Ancona and\nPescara shows stylized statistical properties that are reminiscent of Kirman\nand F\\\"ollmer's ant recruitment model, although with two ant colonies\nrepresented by the two ports. From the point of view of a fisherman, the two\nfishing areas are not equally attractive, and he tends to prefer the one closer\nto where he is based. This piece of evidence led us to extend the original ants\nmodel to a situation with two asymmetric zones and finite resources.

Here we report, using isotopically-labelled\nexperiments, that crack tips in an industrial Ti-6Al-2Sn-4Zr-6Mo alloy are\nstrongly enriched (>5 at.%) in oxygen from the water vapour, far greater than\nthe amounts (0.25 at.%) required to embrittle the material. Surprisingly,\nrelatively little hydrogen (deuterium) is measured, despite careful preparation\nand analysis. Therefore, we suggest that a combined effect of O and H leads to\ncracking, with O playing a vital role, since it is well-known to cause\nembrittlement of the alloy. In contrast it appears that in alpha+beta Ti\nalloys, it may be that H may drain away into the bulk owing to its high\nsolubility in beta-Ti, rather than being retained in the stress field of the\ncrack tip. Therefore, whilst hydrides may form on the fracture surface,\nhydrogen ingress might not be the only plausible mechanism of embrittlement of\nthe underlying matrix. This possibility challenges decades of understanding of\nstress-corrosion cracking as being related solely to the hydrogen enhanced\nlocalised plasticity (HELP) mechanism, which explains why H-doped Ti alloys are\nembrittled. This would change the perspective on stress corrosion embrittlement\naway from a focus purely on hydrogen to also consider the ingress of O\noriginating from the water vapour, insights critical for designing corrosion\nresistant materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Sep 2020 14:09:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Nov 2021 08:32:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-24"}

A resolution of up to 34 pc is\nreached within galaxies; this allows the simulation to capture the multi-phase\nnature of the interstellar medium and the clumpy nature of the star formation\nprocess in galaxies. In this introductory paper, we present several key\nfundamental properties of galaxies and their black holes, including the galaxy\nmass function, cosmic star formation rate, galactic metallicities, the\nKennicutt-Schmidt relation, the stellar-to-halo mass relation, galaxy sizes,\nstellar kinematics and morphology, gas content within galaxies and its\nkinematics, and the black hole mass and spin properties over time. The various\nscaling relations are broadly reproduced by NewHorizon with some differences\nwith the standard observables. Owing to its exquisite spatial resolution,\nNewHorizon captures the inefficient process of star formation in galaxies,\nwhich evolve over time from being more turbulent, gas rich, and star bursting\nat high redshift. These high-redshift galaxies are also more compact, and they\nare more elliptical and clumpier until the level of internal gas turbulence\ndecays enough to allow for the formation of discs.

This learning process can effectively find good wide minima\nwithout being trapped in poor local ones. We present a novel account of how\nsuch effective deep learning emerges through the interactions of the SGD and\nthe geometrical structure of the loss landscape. Rather than being a normal\ndiffusion process (i.e. Brownian motion) as often assumed, we find that the SGD\nexhibits rich, complex dynamics when navigating through the loss landscape;\ninitially, the SGD exhibits anomalous superdiffusion, which attenuates\ngradually and changes to subdiffusion at long times when the solution is\nreached. Such learning dynamics happen ubiquitously in different DNNs such as\nResNet and VGG-like networks and are insensitive to batch size and learning\nrate. The anomalous superdiffusion process during the initial learning phase\nindicates that the motion of SGD along the loss landscape possesses\nintermittent, big jumps; this non-equilibrium property enables the SGD to\nescape from sharp local minima. By adapting the methods developed for studying\nenergy landscapes in complex physical systems, we find that such superdiffusive\nlearning dynamics are due to the interactions of the SGD and the fractal-like\nstructure of the loss landscape. We further develop a simple model to\ndemonstrate the mechanistic role of the fractal loss landscape in enabling the\nSGD to effectively find global minima.

By comparing the full-disk meterwave solar maps during a quiet solar\nperiod and the modelled thermal bremsstrahlung emission, we characterise these\npropagation effects.

The Hard X-ray\nModulation Telescope (Insight-HXMT) is capable of detecting emissions above 30\nkeV, and is therefore an ideal instrument to do so. Here we report the\ndiscovery of LFQPOs above 200 keV in the new black hole MAXI J1820+070 in the\nX-ray hard state, which allows us to understand the behaviours of LFQPOs at\nhundreds of kiloelectronvolts. The phase lag of the LFQPO is constant around\nzero below 30 keV, and becomes a soft lag (that is, the high-energy photons\narrive first) above 30 keV. The soft lag gradually increases with energy and\nreaches ~0.9s in the 150-200 keV band. The detection at energies above 200 keV,\nthe large soft lag and the energy-related behaviors of the LFQPO pose a great\nchallenge for most currently existing models, but suggest that the LFQPO\nprobably originates from the precession of a small-scale jet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Sep 2020 15:14:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-23"}

These SKUs are usually sold for\none season only, without any replenishments. An exponential factorization\nmachine (EFM) sales forecast model is developed to solve this problem which not\nonly considers SKU attributes, but also pairwise interactions. The EFM model is\nsignificantly different from the original Factorization Machines (FM) from\ntwo-fold: (1) the attribute-level formulation for explanatory variables and (2)\nexponential formulation for the positive response variable. The attribute-level\nformation excludes infeasible intra-attribute interactions and results in more\nefficient feature engineering comparing with the conventional one-hot encoding,\nwhile the exponential formulation is demonstrated more effective than the\nlog-transformation for the positive but not skewed distributed responses. In\norder to estimate the parameters, percentage error squares (PES) and error\nsquares (ES) are minimized by a proposed adaptive batch gradient descent method\nover the training set. Real-world data provided by a footwear retailer in\nSingapore is used for testing the proposed approach. The forecasting\nperformance in terms of both mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and mean\nabsolute error (MAE) compares favourably with not only off-the-shelf models but\nalso results reported by extant sales and demand forecasting studies. The\neffectiveness of the proposed approach is also demonstrated by two external\npublic datasets. Moreover, we prove the theoretical relationships between PES\nand ES minimization, and present an important property of the PES minimization\nfor regression models; that it trains models to underestimate data. This\nproperty fits the situation of sales forecasting where unit-holding cost is\nmuch greater than the unit-shortage cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Sep 2020 15:21:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-23"}

These thin film stressors are analogous to SiN$_{x}$\nbased stressors implemented in industrial CMOS processes to enhance Si\nmobility, suggesting that our concept is highly scalable and may be applied for\nlarge-scale integration of strain engineered TMDC devices. We choose optically\ntransparent stressors to allow us to probe MoS$_{2}$ strain through Raman\nspectroscopy. Combining thickness dependent analyses of Raman peak shifts in\nMoS$_{2}$ with atomistic simulations, we can explore layer-by-layer strain\ntransfer. MoS$_{2}$ on conventional substrates (SiO$_{2}$, MgO) show strain\ntransfer into the top two layers of multilayer flakes with limited strain\ntransfer to monolayers due to substrate adhesion. To mitigate this limitation,\nwe also explore stressors on van der Waals heterostructures constructed of\nmonolayer (1L) MoS$_{2}$ on hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). This concept frees\nthe 1L-MoS$_{2}$ allowing for a 0.85$\\%$ strain to be applied to the monolayer\nwith a corresponding strain induced bandgap change of 75 meV. By using thin\nfilms with higher stress, strain may be engineered to be even higher. Various\nstressors and deposition methods are considered, showing a stressor material\nindependent transfer of strain that only depends on stressor film force with\nnegligible defects induced into MoS$_{2}$ when thermal evaporation is used.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Sep 2020 15:36:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Jan 2021 22:14:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 14 Jul 2021 14:26:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-15"}

Much of this success is due\nto the ability of MPC to enforce state and control constraints, which are\ncrucial in many applications of control. In order to avoid the need for an\nobserver, output-feedback model predictive control with online identification\n(OFMPCOI) uses the block observable canonical form whose state consists of past\nvalues of the control inputs and measured outputs. Online identification is\nperformed using recursive least squares (RLS) with variable-rate forgetting.\nThe article describes the algorithmic details of OFMPCOI and numerically\ninvestigates its performance through a collection of numerical examples that\nhighlight various control challenges, such as model order uncertainty, sensor\nnoise, prediction horizon, stabilization, magnitude and move-size saturation,\nand stabilization. The numerical examples are used to probe the performance of\nOFMPCOI in terms of persistency, consistency, and exigency. Since OFMPCOI does\nnot employ a separate control perturbation to enhance persistency, the focus is\non self-generated persistency during transient operation. For closed-loop\nidentification using RLS, sensor noise gives rise to bias in the identified\nmodel, and the goal is to determine the effect of the lack of consistency.\nFinally, the numerical examples reveal exigency, which is the extent to which\nthe online identification emphasizes model characteristics that are most\nrelevant to meeting performance objectives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Sep 2020 15:38:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-23"}

Beyond traditional performance\nmetrics like latency, mobile app developers are interested in reducing app\nenergy usage. Some mobile apps have centralized locations for parameter tuning,\nsimilar to databases and operating systems, but it is common for mobile apps to\nhave hundreds of parameters scattered around the source code. The correlation\nbetween these \"deep\" parameters and app energy usage is unclear. Researchers\nhave studied the energy effects of deep parameters in specific modules, but we\nlack a systematic understanding of the energy impact of mobile deep parameters.\n  In this paper we empirically investigate this topic, combining a developer\nsurvey with systematic energy measurements. Our motivational survey of 25\nAndroid developers suggests that developers do not understand, and largely\nignore, the energy impact of deep parameters. To assess the potential\nimplications of this practice, we propose a deep parameter energy profiling\nframework that can analyze the energy impact of deep parameters in an app. Our\nframework identifies deep parameters, mutates them based on our parameter value\nselection scheme, and performs reliable energy impact analysis. Applying the\nframework to 16 popular Android apps, we discovered that deep parameter-induced\nenergy inefficiency is rare. We found only 2 out of 1644 deep parameters for\nwhich a different value would significantly improve its app's energy\nefficiency. A detailed analysis found that most deep parameters have either no\nenergy impact, limited energy impact, or an energy impact only under extreme\nvalues. Our study suggests that it is generally safe for developers to ignore\nthe energy impact when choosing deep parameter values in mobile apps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Sep 2020 15:54:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 16 Jan 2022 21:21:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

In\norder to ensure safety and reliability in the electricity grid, the power flow\nin the grid needs to be observed to prevent overloading. Furthermore, the\nenergy supply and consumption need to be continuously balanced to ensure the\nsecurity of energy supply. Therefore a high quality of power flow forecasts for\nthe next few hours within the grid are needed. In this paper we investigate\nforecasts of the vertical power flow at transformer between the medium and high\nvoltage grid. Forecasting the vertical power flow is challenging due to\nconstantly changing characteristics of the power flow at the transformer. This\nis mainly a result of dynamic grid topologies, changes in the installed assets,\nmaintenance of the transformer itself as well as the volatile generation. In\nthis paper we present a novel approach to deal with these challenges. For the\nmulti step time series forecasts a Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) is used. In\nour presented approach an update process where the model is retrained regularly\nis investigated and compared to baseline models. The model is retrained as soon\nas a sufficient amount of new measurements are available. This retraining\nshould capture changes in the characteristic of the transformer that the model\nhas not yet seen in the past and therefore cannot be predicted by the model.\nFor the regular update process we investigate different strategies where\nespecially the number of used epochs are considered, but also different\nlearning rates are used. We show that our new approach significantly\noutperforms the investigated baseline approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Sep 2020 06:05:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-28"}

Similar problems can\narise in a general context, and we use them to explain the success or failure\nof some designs.

Further, four ways to break the symmetry are compared\nnumerically: A bias in the output, a shift in the input, a quadratic term in\nthe readout, and a mixture of even and odd activation functions. Firstly, we\ntest their susceptibility to the mirror-attractor. Secondly, we evaluate their\nperformance on the task of predicting Lorenz data with the mean shifted to\nzero. The short-time prediction is measured with the forecast horizon while the\nlargest Lyapunov exponent and the correlation dimension are used to represent\nthe climate. Finally, the same analysis is repeated on a combined dataset of\nthe Lorenz attractor and the Halvorsen attractor, which we designed to reveal\npotential problems with symmetry. We find that all methods except the output\nbias are able to fully break the symmetry with input shift and quadratic\nreadout performing the best overall.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Sep 2020 16:00:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 2020 10:28:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-25"}

The device operated under constant and\nintense angular velocity for each high voltage applied. The measurements were\nmade in the similar way than an analogue magnetic gyroscope, by considering\nclockwise and counterclockwise rotations. We found that there are significant\nweight reduction on the device in the clockwise case, with one order of\nmagnitude higher than the magnetic case. In addition, we detected a similar\nasymmetry in the observation of the effect, that is, there are smaller results\nfor the anomalous forces in counterclockwise rotation. We also propose a\ntheoretical model to explain the quantitative effect based on average values of\nmacroscopic observables of the device rotation and concluded that it is\nconsistent with the experimental results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Sep 2020 00:21:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-20"}
