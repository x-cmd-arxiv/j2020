One example of\nsuch plasmonic crystals are graphene nanosheets that are periodically arranged\nwithin a non-magnetic bulk dielectric. We identify local geometric resonances\non the length scale of the small scale period. From a materials perspective,\nthe graphene surface exhibits a dispersive surface conductance captured by the\nDrude model. Together these phenomena conspire to generate Lorentz resonances\nat frequencies controlled by the surface geometry and the surface conductance.\nThe Lorentz resonances found in the frequency response of the effective\ndielectric tensor of the bulk metamaterial is shown to be given by an explicit\nformula, in which material properties and geometric resonances are decoupled.\nThis formula is rigorous and obtained directly from corrector fields describing\nlocal electrostatic fields inside the heterogeneous structure.

This\nrecombination region, it's argued here, is a second order effect induced by the\npremature quenching of the shuffle reactions, which inhibits the decay to\nequilibrium in the first approximation.\n  Its structure and kinetics are studied in detail to capture the small but\nfinite reaction rates accounting for its characteristic length scale, which is\nlarge enough to render the diffusive transport negligible, hence deactivating\nthe upstream feedback link with the main flame structure. It is isothermal and\ncan be described, in moderately lean flames, by just the distribution of H$_2$\nas the sole degree of freedom, a drastic reduction consequence of the strongly\nconstrained evolution imposed by the almost exactly quenched shuffle reactions.\n  The rate of decay to equilibrium of H$_2$ and radicals is thus dictated by\nthe balance between the convective transport and chemical sinks controlled by\nthe HO$_2$ kinetics, which becomes dominant after the shuffle reactions quench.\nEssentially, it is a two-step mechanism with the first, rate-limiting step\nconverting O$_2$ into HO$_2$, whereas the second one, comprising multiple fast,\nparallel pathways, depletes radicals as HO$_2$ is converted into O$_2$ and\nH$_2$O.\n  Generalizations to very lean and nearly stoichiometric flames, when the one\ndegree of freedom model is not applicable, as well as the effect of heat losses\nare also briefly discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Sep 2020 17:33:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-28"}

Such field mixes singlet\nand triplet components and yields the rich physics of magnetoelectric\nphenomena.

Despite the\nlarge interest, few investigations into the frequency stability of high-$Q$\nresonators have been reported. Such resonators are characterized by a linewidth\nsignificantly smaller than typically employed measurement bandwidths, which is\nthe opposite regime to what is normally considered for sensors. Here, the\nfrequency stability of high-$Q$ silicon nitride string resonators is\ninvestigated both in open-loop and closed-loop configurations. The stability is\nhere characterized using the Allan deviation. For open-loop tracking, it is\nfound that the Allan deviation gets separated into two regimes, one limited by\nthe thermomechanical noise of the resonator and the other by the detection\nnoise of the optical transduction system. The point of transition between the\ntwo regimes is the resonator response time, which can be shown to have a linear\ndependence on $Q$. Laser power fluctuations from the optical readout is found\nto present a fundamental limit to the frequency stability. Finally, for\nclosed-loop measurements, the response time is shown to no longer be\nintrinsically limited but instead given by the bandwidth of the closed-loop\ntracking system. Computed Allan deviations based on theory are given as well\nand found to agree well with the measurements.

Greater gains\nare possible outside traditional GNSS orbits and spectrum. GNSS from low Earth\norbit (LEO) has long been viewed as promising but expensive, requiring large\nconstellations for rapid navigation solutions. The recent emergence of\ncommercial broadband LEO mega-constellations invites study on dual-purposing\nthese for both communications -- their primary mission -- and a secondary\npositioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) service. Operating at shorter\nwavelengths than traditional GNSS, these constellations would permit highly\ndirective, relatively compact receiver antennas. PNT-specific on-orbit\nresources would not be required: the transmitters, antennas, clocks, and\nspectrum of the hosting broadband network would suffice for PNT.\nNon-cooperative use of LEO signals for PNT is an option, but cooperation with\nthe constellation operator (\"fusion\" with its communications mission) eases the\nburden of tracking a dense, low-altitude constellation from the ground and\nenables a receiver to produce single-epoch stand-alone PNT solutions. This\npaper proposes such a cooperative concept, termed fused LEO GNSS.

A longstanding\nquestion is whether the eventual loss of such trapped material occurs from\ngradual drift and/or diffusive leakage, or through sporadic `{\\em centrifugal\nbreak out}' (CBO) events, wherein magnetic tension can no longer contain the\nbuilt-up mass. We argue here that recent empirical results for Balmer-$\\alpha$\nemission from such B-star CMs strongly favor the CBO mechanism. Most notably,\nthe fact that the onset of such emission depends mainly on the field strength\nat the Kepler radius, and is largely {\\em independent} of the stellar\nluminosity, strongly disfavors any drift/diffusion process, for which the net\nmass balance would depend on the luminosity-dependent wind feeding rate. In\ncontrast, we show that in a CBO model the {\\em maximum confined mass} in the\nmagnetosphere is independent of this wind feeding rate, and has a dependence on\nfield strength and Kepler radius that naturally explains the empirical scalings\nfor the onset of H$\\alpha$ emission, its associated equivalent width, and even\nits line profile shapes. However, the general lack of observed Balmer emission\nin late-B and A-type stars could still be attributed to a residual level of\ndiffusive or drift leakage that does not allow their much weaker winds to fill\ntheir CMs to the breakout level needed for such emission; alternatively this\nmight result from a transition to a metal-ion wind that lacks the requisite\nHydrogen.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Sep 2020 17:47:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-28"}

First, we show that all projected TBG Hamiltonians can be\nwritten as Positive Semidefinite Hamiltonian, the first example of which was\nfound in [PRL 122, 246401]. We then prove that the interacting TBG Hamiltonian\nexhibits an exact U(4) symmetry in the exactly flat band (nonchiral-flat)\nlimit. We further define, besides a first chiral limit where the AA stacking\nhopping is zero, a new second chiral limit where the AB/BA stacking hopping is\nzero. In the first chiral-flat limit (or second chiral-flat limit) with exactly\nflat bands, the TBG is enhanced to have an exact U(4)$\\times$U(4) symmetry,\nwhose generators are different between the two chiral limits. While in the\nfirst chiral limit and in the non-chiral case these symmetries have been found\nin [PRX 10, 031034] for the $8$ lowest bands, we here prove that they are valid\nfor projection into any $8 n_\\text{max}$ particle-hole symmetric TBG bands,\nwith $n_\\text{max}>1$ being the practical case for small twist angles\n$<1^\\circ$. Furthermore, in the first or second chiral-nonflat limit without\nflat bands, an exact U(4) symmetry still remains. We also elucidate the link\nbetween the U(4) symmetry presented here and the similar but different U(4) of\n[PRL 122, 246401]. Furthermore, we show that our projected Hamiltonian can be\nviewed as the normal-ordered Coulomb interaction plus a Hartree-Fock term from\npassive bands, and exhibits a many-body particle-hole symmetry which renders\nthe physics symmetric around charge neutrality. We also provide an efficient\nparameterization of the interacting Hamiltonian. The existence of two chiral\nlimits, with an enlarged symmetry suggests a possible duality of the model yet\nundiscovered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Sep 2020 18:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 17:01:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2022 17:18:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-29"}

Deuterium fractionation can be used as a\ntool to constrain formation mechanisms. High abundances of deuterated molecules\nare routinely observed in the dense interstellar medium, with the ratio between\ndeuterated molecules and the main isotopologue enhanced by several orders of\nmagnitude with respect to the elemental D/H ratio. In the case of ammonia, the\ndetection of its triply deuterated isotopologue hints at high abundances of the\ndeuterated intermediate nitrogen radicals, ND, NHD and ND$_2$. So far however,\nonly ND has been detected in the interstellar medium. In this paper, to\nconstrain the formation of ammonia, we aim at determining the NHD/NH$_2$ and\nND$_2$/NHD abundance ratios, and compare them with the predictions of both pure\ngas-phase and grain-surface chemical models. We searched for the fundamental\nrotational transitions of NHD and ND$_2$ towards the class 0 protostar\nIRAS16293-2422, towards which NH, NH$_2$ and ND had been previously detected.\nBoth NHD and ND$_2$ are detected in absorption towards the source.

We study different regions along the\noutflow zone which extends out to ~2.3 kpc in the same direction (east-west) as\nthe radio jet, as well as nuclear/circumnuclear regions in the host galaxy\ndisk. The deprojected outflowing velocities of the cold molecular gas (median\nVcentral~189 km s^-1) are generally lower than those of the outflowing ionized\ngas, which reach deprojected velocities of up to 750 km s^-1 close to the AGN,\nand their spatial profiles follow those of the ionized phase.

We derive molecular and ionized outflow masses of ~5.2x10^7 Msun and\n8.5x10^4 Msun and molecular and ionized outflow mass rates of ~51 Msun yr^-1\nand 0.14 Msun yr^-1. Therefore, the molecular phase dominates the outflow mass\nand outflow mass rate, while the outflow kinetic power and momentum are similar\nin both phases. However, the wind momentum load for the molecular and ionized\noutflow phases are ~27-5 and <1, which suggests that the molecular phase is not\nmomentum conserving while the ionized one most certainly is.

We find that the\ndiffusion of inert molecules is inhibited by the presence of the polymers.\nCounter-intuitively, small, hydrophobic molecules display smaller reduction in\nmobility and also able to diffuse faster through the system by leveraging\ncrowding specific parameters. We explained this phenomenon by developing a de\nnovo model and using these results, we hypothesized that non-specific\nhydrophobic interactions between the molecules and polymer chains could\nlocalize the molecules into compartments of overlapped and entangled chains\nwhere they experience microviscosity, rather than macroviscosity.

Yet, due to the complexity and diversity of user\nenvironments, automatically calculating ideal positions of virtual content that\nis adaptive to the context of the scene is considered a challenging task.\nMotivated by this problem, in this paper we introduce SceneGen, a generative\ncontextual augmentation framework that predicts virtual object positions and\norientations within existing scenes.

Due to the network\narchitecture of these materials, imbibement with water often results in uniform\nswelling and isotropic expansion which scales with the degree of cross-linking.\nHowever, the development of internal stresses during swelling can have dramatic\nconsequences, leading to surface instabilities as well as rupture or bursting\nevents. To better understand hydrogel behavior, macroscopic mechanical\ncharacterization techniques (e.g.\\ tensile testing, rheometry) are often used,\nhowever most commonly these techniques are employed on samples that are in two\ndistinct states: (1) unswollen and without any solvent, or (2) in an\nequilibrium swelling state where the maximum amount of water has been imbibed.\nRarely is the dynamic process of swelling studied, especially in samples where\nrupture or failure events are observed. To address this gap, here we focus on\nrupture events in poly(ethylene glycol)-based networks that occur in response\nto swelling with water. Rupture events were visualized using high-speed\nimaging, and the influence of swelling on material properties was characterized\nusing dynamic mechanical analysis. We find that rupture events follow a\nthree-stage process that includes a waiting period, a slow fracture period, and\na final stage in which a rapid increase in the velocity of crack propagation is\nobserved. We describe this fracture behavior based on changes in material\nproperties that occur during swelling, and highlight how this rupture behavior\ncan be controlled by straight-forward modifications to the hydrogel network\nstructure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Sep 2020 18:38:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-29"}

While human impedance is\ntypically modelled as a linear system, our experiments on a single-joint\nexoskeleton testbed involving 10 human subjects show evidence of nonlinear\nbehavior: a low-frequency asymptotic phase for the dynamic stiffness of the\nhuman that is different than the expected zero, and an unexpectedly consistent\ndamping ratio as the stiffness and inertia vary. To explain these observations,\nthis paper considers a new frequency-domain model of the human joint dynamics\nfeaturing complex value stiffness comprising a real stiffness term and a\nhysteretic damping term. Using a statistical F-test we show that the hysteretic\ndamping term is not only significant but is even more significant than the\nlinear damping term. Further analysis reveals a linear trend linking hysteretic\ndamping and the real part of the stiffness, which allows us to simplify the\ncomplex stiffness model down to a 1-parameter system. Then, we introduce and\ndemonstrate a customizable fractional-order controller that exploits this\nhysteretic damping behavior to improve strength amplification bandwidth while\nmaintaining stability, and explore a tuning approach which ensures that this\nstability property is robust to muscle co-contraction for each individual.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Sep 2020 21:52:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-29"}

In addition,\ndynamic contextual information can have a significant impact on the demand\nvalues, and therefore needs to be captured. For example, in a bike-sharing\nsystem, bike usage can be impacted by weather. Existing methods assume the\ncontextual impact is fixed. However, we note that the contextual impact evolves\nover time. We propose a novel context integrated relational model, Context\nIntegrated Graph Neural Network (CIGNN), which leverages the temporal,\nrelational, spatial, and dynamic contextual dependencies for multi-step ahead\ndemand forecasting.

Conventional methods are mainly based on user\ngenerated contents, e.g., profiles, likes, and texts of an individual, on\nsocial media, which are actually not very reliable. In contrast, dyadic\nconversations between individuals can not only capture how one expresses\noneself, but also reflect how one reacts to different situations. Rich\ncontextual information in dyadic conversation can explain an individual's\nresponse during his or her conversation. In this paper, we propose a novel\naugmented Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model for learning unsupervised Personal\nConversational Embeddings (PCE) based on dyadic conversations between\nindividuals. We adjust the formulation of each layer of a conventional GRU with\nsequence to sequence learning and personal information of both sides of the\nconversation. Based on the learned PCE, we can infer the personality of each\nindividual. We conduct experiments on the Movie Script dataset, which is\ncollected from conversations between characters in movie scripts. We find that\nmodeling dyadic conversations between individuals can significantly improve\npersonality inference accuracy.

But view variance of gait features would change human appearance\ngreatly and reduce its performance. Most existing gait datasets usually collect\ndata with a dozen different angles, or even more few. Limited view angles would\nprevent learning better view invariant feature. It can further improve\nrobustness of gait recognition if we collect data with various angles at 1\ndegree interval. But it is time consuming and labor consuming to collect this\nkind of dataset. In this paper, we, therefore, introduce a Dense-View GEIs Set\n(DV-GEIs) to deal with the challenge of limited view angles. This set can cover\nthe whole view space, view angle from 0 degree to 180 degree with 1 degree\ninterval. In addition, Dense-View GAN (DV-GAN) is proposed to synthesize this\ndense view set. DV-GAN consists of Generator, Discriminator and Monitor, where\nMonitor is designed to preserve human identification and view information. The\nproposed method is evaluated on the CASIA-B and OU-ISIR dataset. The\nexperimental results show that DV-GEIs synthesized by DV-GAN is an effective\nway to learn better view invariant feature.

In this work, we are presenting latency\nparameters which has shown some minor differences from the 3GPP report.\nEspecially, for time division duplexing (TDD) mode of operation, the\ndifferences are observed. It might be possible that the differences are due to\nassumptions made outside the scope of the evaluation. However, we considered\nthe worst case parameter.

While this\nconcept is well-known, a major challenge has been the implementation: how to\nrationally design materials with functional non-equilibrium states and quantify\nthe dissipation? Here we address these questions for the widely used colloidal\nnanoparticles that convey several functionalities. We propose that useful\nnon-equilibrium states can be realised by creating and maintaining steady-state\nnanoparticle concentration gradients by continuous injection and dissipation of\nenergy. We experimentally demonstrate this with superparamagnetic iron oxide\nnanoparticles that in thermodynamic equilibrium form a homogeneous functional\nfluid with a strong magnetic response (a ferrofluid). To create non-equilibrium\nfunctionalities, we charge the nanoparticles with anionic charge control agents\nto create electroferrofluids where nanoparticles act as charge carriers that\ncan be driven with electric fields and current to non-homogeneous dissipative\nsteady-states. The dissipative steady-states exhibit voltage-controlled\nmagnetic properties and emergent diffuse interfaces. The diffuse interfaces\nrespond strongly to external magnetic fields, leading to dissipative patterns\nthat are not possible in the equilibrium state. We identify the closest\nnon-dissipative analogues of these dissipative patterns, discuss the\ndifferences, and highlight how pattern formation in electroferrofluids is\nlinked to dissipation that can be directly quantified. Beyond electrically\ncontrolled ferrofluids and patterns, we foresee that the concept can be\ngeneralized to other functional nanoparticles to create various scientifically\nand technologically relevant non-equilibrium states with optical, electrical,\ncatalytic, and mechanical responses that are not possible in thermodynamic\nequilibrium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Sep 2020 10:57:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-29"}

The traditional neural\nnetwork has a limited ability to learn features. Even if a host of feature maps\nis expanded to obtain more semantic information, the accuracy of segmenting the\nfinal medical image is slightly improved, and the features are excessively\nredundant. To solve the above problems, in this paper, we propose a novel\nend-to-end semantic segmentation algorithm, DT-Net, and use two new convolution\nstrategies to better achieve end-to-end semantic segmentation of medical\nimages. 1. In the feature mining and feature fusion stage, we construct a\nmulti-directional integrated convolution (MDIC). The core idea is to use the\nmulti-scale convolution to enhance the local multi-directional feature maps to\ngenerate enhanced feature maps and to mine the generated features that contain\nmore semantics without increasing the number of feature maps. 2. We also aim to\nfurther excavate and retain more meaningful deep features reduce a host of\nnoise features in the training process. Therefore, we propose a convolution\nthresholding strategy. The central idea is to set a threshold to eliminate a\nlarge number of redundant features and reduce computational complexity. Through\nthe two strategies proposed above, the algorithm proposed in this paper\nproduces state-of-the-art results on two public medical image datasets. We\nprove in detail that our proposed strategy plays an important role in feature\nmining and eliminating redundant features.

This is naturally formulated as a reinforcement learning problem\nunder partial observations, where an agent must estimate relevant latent\nvariables in the world from its evidence, anticipate possible future states,\nand choose actions that optimize total expected reward. This problem can be\nsolved by control theory, which allows us to find the optimal actions for a\ngiven system dynamics and objective function. However, animals often appear to\nbehave suboptimally. Why? We hypothesize that animals have their own flawed\ninternal model of the world, and choose actions with the highest expected\nsubjective reward according to that flawed model. We describe this behavior as\nrational but not optimal. The problem of Inverse Rational Control (IRC) aims to\nidentify which internal model would best explain an agent's actions. Our\ncontribution here generalizes past work on Inverse Rational Control which\nsolved this problem for discrete control in partially observable Markov\ndecision processes.

However, the high error rate in third-generation sequencing data raises a\nnew challenge to established domain analysis pipelines.

In this paper, we aim at designing the optimal ToU\npricing, jointly considering the social cost of the utility and the storage\ninvestment decisions of users. Since the storage investment costs are users'\nprivate information, we design low-complexity contracts to elicit the necessary\ninformation and induce the proper behavior of users' storage investment. The\nproposed contracts only specify three contract items, which guides users of\narbitrarily many different storage-cost types to invest in full, partial, or no\nstorage capacity with respect to their peak demands.

One natural and quite general way to represent history-dependent\nrewards is via a Mealy machine, a finite state automaton that produces output\nsequences from input sequences. In our formal setting, we consider a Markov\ndecision process (MDP) that models the dynamics of the environment in which the\nagent evolves and a Mealy machine synchronized with this MDP to formalize the\nnon-Markovian reward function. While the MDP is known by the agent, the reward\nfunction is unknown to the agent and must be learned.\n  Our approach to overcome this challenge is to use Angluin's $L^*$ active\nlearning algorithm to learn a Mealy machine representing the underlying\nnon-Markovian reward machine (MRM). Formal methods are used to determine the\noptimal strategy for answering so-called membership queries posed by $L^*$.\n  Moreover, we prove that the expected reward achieved will eventually be at\nleast as much as a given, reasonable value provided by a domain expert. We\nevaluate our framework on three problems. The results show that using $L^*$ to\nlearn an MRM in a non-Markovian reward decision process is effective.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Sep 2020 13:54:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Sep 2020 08:56:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-01"}

The\nDFD is a D -$^3$He fuelled, aneutronic, thermonuclear fusion propulsion system.\nThis fusion propulsion concept is based on a magnetically confined field\nreversed configuration plasma, where the deuterium propellant is heated by\nfusion products, and then expanded into a magnetic nozzle, providing both\nthrust and electrical energy to the spacecraft [1]. The trajectories\ncalculations and analysis for the Titan mission are obtained based on the\ncharacteristics provided by the PPPL [1]. Two different profile missions are\nconsidered: the first one is a thrust-coast-thrust profile with constant thrust\nand specific impulse; the second scenario is a continuous and constant thrust\nprofile mission. Each mission study is divided into four different phases,\nstarting from the initial low Earth orbit departure, the interplanetary\ntrajectory, Saturn orbit insertion and the Titan orbit insertion. For all\nmission phases, maneuver time and propellant consumption are calculated. The\nresults of calculations and mission analysis offer a complete overview of the\nadvantages in term of payload mass and travel time. It is important to\nemphasize that the deceleration capability is one of the DFD game changer: in\nfact, the DFD performance allows to rapidly reach high velocities and\ndecelerate in even shorter time period. This capability results in a total trip\nduration of 2.6 years for the thrust-coast-thrust profile and less than 2 years\nconsidering the continuous thrust profile. The high payload enabling\ncapability, combined with the huge electrical power available from the fusion\nreactor, leads to a tremendous advantage compared to present technology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Sep 2020 15:29:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-05"}

This combination can significantly reduce data movement, allowing\na reduction in run time as well as peak memory. In the Exascale computing era,\nfrequent data transfer (e.g., memory bandwidth, PCIe bandwidth for GPUs, or\nnetwork) is the performance bottleneck rather than the peak FLOPS of the\nprocessing unit. Like many other adjoint-based optimization problems, FWI is\ncostly in terms of the number of floating-point operations, large memory\nfootprint during backpropagation, and data transfer overheads. Past work for\nadjoint methods has developed checkpointing methods that reduce the peak memory\nrequirements during backpropagation at the cost of additional floating-point\ncomputations. Combining this traditional checkpointing with error-controlled\nlossy compression, we explore the three-way tradeoff between memory, precision,\nand time to solution. We investigate how approximation errors introduced by\nlossy compression of the forward solution impact the objective function\ngradient and final inverted solution. Empirical results from these numerical\nexperiments indicate that high lossy-compression rates (compression factors\nranging up to 100) have a relatively minor impact on convergence rates and the\nquality of the final solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Sep 2020 15:38:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Sep 2021 15:46:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-16"}

DWIE is conceived as an entity-centric dataset that describes\ninteractions and properties of conceptual entities on the level of the complete\ndocument. This contrasts with currently dominant mention-driven approaches that\nstart from the detection and classification of named entity mentions in\nindividual sentences. Further, DWIE presented two main challenges when building\nand evaluating IE models for it. First, the use of traditional mention-level\nevaluation metrics for NER and RE tasks on entity-centric DWIE dataset can\nresult in measurements dominated by predictions on more frequently mentioned\nentities. We tackle this issue by proposing a new entity-driven metric that\ntakes into account the number of mentions that compose each of the predicted\nand ground truth entities. Second, the document-level multi-task annotations\nrequire the models to transfer information between entity mentions located in\ndifferent parts of the document, as well as between different tasks, in a joint\nlearning setting. To realize this, we propose to use graph-based neural message\npassing techniques between document-level mention spans. Our experiments show\nan improvement of up to 5.5 F1 percentage points when incorporating neural\ngraph propagation into our joint model.

In\nthis paper, we propose to utilize wearable Electrodermal Activity (EDA) sensors\nin conjunction with signal processing and machine learning techniques to\ndevelop first time ever a dehydration self-monitoring tool, \\emph{Monitoring My\nDehydration} (MMD), that can instantly detect the hydration level of human\nskin. Moreover, we develop an Android application over Bluetooth to connect\nwith wearable EDA sensor integrated wristband to track hydration levels of the\nusers real-time and instantly alert to the users when the hydration level goes\nbeyond the danger level. To validate our developed tool's performance, we\nrecruit 5 users, carefully designed the water intake routines to annotate the\ndehydration ground truth and trained state-of-art machine learning models to\npredict instant hydration level i.e., well-hydrated, hydrated, dehydrated and\nvery dehydrated. Our system provides an accuracy of 84.5% in estimating\ndehydration level with an sensitivity of 87.5% and a specificity of 90.3% which\nprovides us confidence of moving forward with our method for larger\nlongitudinal study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Sep 2020 16:55:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-30"}
