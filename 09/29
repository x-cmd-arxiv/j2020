To formulate models of stochastic dynamics the\nconventional approach consists in superimposing random fluctuations on a\nsuitable deterministic evolution. These fluctuations are sampled from\nprobability distributions that are prescribed a priori, most commonly as\nGaussian or L\\'evy. While these distributions are motivated by (generalised)\ncentral limit theorems they are nevertheless \\textit{unbounded}, meaning that\narbitrarily large fluctuations can be obtained with finite probability. This\nproperty implies the violation of fundamental physical principles such as\nspecial relativity and may yield divergencies for basic physical quantities\nlike energy. Here we solve the fundamental problem of unbounded random\nfluctuations by constructing a comprehensive theoretical framework of\nstochastic processes possessing physically realistic finite propagation\nvelocity. Our approach is motivated by the theory of L\\'evy walks, which we\nembed into an extension of conventional Poisson-Kac processes. The resulting\nextended theory employs generalised transition rates to model subtle\nmicroscopic dynamics, which reproduces non-trivial spatio-temporal correlations\non macroscopic scales. It thus enables the modelling of many different kinds of\ndynamical features, as we demonstrate by three physically and biologically\nmotivated examples. The corresponding stochastic models capture the whole\nspectrum of diffusive dynamics from normal to anomalous diffusion, including\nthe striking `Brownian yet non Gaussian' diffusion, and more sophisticated\nphenomena such as senescence. Extended Poisson-Kac theory can therefore be used\nto model a wide range of finite velocity dynamical phenomena that are observed\nexperimentally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Sep 2020 16:03:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2022 18:19:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-25"}

However, due to the novelty of\nthe field, the performance of event-based systems on many vision tasks is still\nlower compared to conventional frame-based solutions. The main reasons for this\nperformance gap are: the lower spatial resolution of event sensors, compared to\nframe cameras; the lack of large-scale training datasets; the absence of well\nestablished deep learning architectures for event-based processing. In this\npaper, we address all these problems in the context of an event-based object\ndetection task. First, we publicly release the first high-resolution\nlarge-scale dataset for object detection.

Many studies have gained key\ninsights into this question by studying the classic Kuramoto oscillator model\non static networks. However, new questions arise when network structure is\ntime-varying or when the oscillator system is multistable, the latter of which\ncan occur when an inertial term is added to the Kuramoto model. While the\nconsequences of evolving topology and multistability on collective behavior\nhave been examined separately, real-world systems such as gene regulatory\nnetworks and the brain can exhibit these properties simultaneously. How does\nthe rewiring of network connectivity affect synchronization in systems with\nmultistability, where different paths of network evolution may differentially\nimpact system dynamics?

We\nshow that hysteretic synchronization behavior occurs when the network density\nof coupled inertial oscillators is slowly varied as the dynamics evolve.\nMoreover, we find that certain fixed-density rewiring schemes induce\nsignificant changes to the level of global synchrony, and that these changes\nremain after the network returns to its initial configuration and are robust to\na wide range of network perturbations. Our findings suggest that the specific\nprogression of network topology, in addition to its initial or final static\nstructure, can play a considerable role in modulating the collective behavior\nof systems evolving on complex networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Sep 2020 16:48:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-29"}

We consider\nthe possibility that their progenitors assumed to be globular clusters may have\nformed elsewhere, migrated to and assembled near their present location. The\nmain challenge for this scenario is whether globular clusters can withstand the\ntidal field of their host galaxies. Our analysis suggests that provided the\nmass-density distribution of background potential is relatively shallow, as in\nsome galaxies with relatively flat surface brightness profiles, the tidal field\nnear the center of galaxies may be shown to be able to compress rather than\ndisrupt a globular cluster at a distance from the center much smaller than the\nconventionally defined `tidal disruption radius', $r_t$. To do so, we adopt a\npreviously constructed formalism and consider the secular evolution of star\nclusters with a homogeneous mass density distribution. We analytically solve\nthe secular equations in the limit that the mass density of stars in the\ngalactic center approaches a uniform distribution. Our model indicates that a\nstar cluster could travel to distances much smaller than $r_t$ without\ndisruption, thus potentially contributing to the formation of the nuclear\ncluster. However, appropriate numerical N-body simulations are needed to\nconfirm our analytic findings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Sep 2020 16:48:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-09"}

The recent advances in\nDeep Learning technologies have made the exploitation of visual tracking\napproaches effective and possible in a wide variety of applications, ranging\nfrom automotive to surveillance and human assistance. However, the majority of\nthe existing works focus exclusively on passive visual tracking, i.e., tracking\nelements in sequences of images by assuming that no actions can be taken to\nadapt the camera position to the motion of the tracked entity. On the contrary,\nin this work, we address visual active tracking, in which the tracker has to\nactively search for and track a specified target.

To address\nthese challenges, we propose a novel DRL-based visual active tracking system\nthat provides continuous action policies. To accelerate training and improve\nthe overall performance, we introduce additional objective functions and a\nHeuristic Trajectory Generator (HTG) to facilitate learning.

Currently, the clinical utility\nof ULM on clinical ultrasound scanners is hindered by the technical\nlimitations, such as long data acquisition time, and compromised tracking\nperformance associated with low imaging frame-rate. Here we present an in-human\nULM on a high frame-rate (HFR) clinical ultrasound scanner to achieve\nsuper-resolution microvessel imaging using a short acquisition time (<10s).\nUltrasound MB data were acquired from different human tissues, (liver, kidney,\npancreatic, and breast tumor) using an HFR clinical scanner. By leveraging the\nHFR and advanced processing techniques including sub-pixel motion registration,\nMB signal separation, and Kalman filter-based tracking, MBs can be robustly\nlocalized and tracked for successful ULM under the circumstances of relatively\nhigh MB concentration and limited data acquisition time in humans. Subtle\nmorphological and hemodynamic information were demonstrated on data acquired\nwith single breath-hold and free-hand scanning. Compared with contrast-enhanced\npower Doppler generated based on the same MB dataset, ULM showed a 5.7-fold\nresolution improvement in a vessel, and provided a wide-range flow speed\nmeasurement that is Doppler angle-independent. This study demonstrated the\nfeasibility of ultrafast in-human ULM in various human tissues based on a\nclinical scanner that supports HFR imaging, and showed a great potential for\nthe implementation of super-resolution ultrasound microvessel imaging in a\nmyriad of clinical applications involving microvascular abnormalities and\npathologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Sep 2020 17:06:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-26"}

Informally, the\nmodel consists of an untrusted analyzer that receives messages sent by\nparticipating parties via a shuffle functionality, the latter potentially\ndisassociates messages from their senders. Prior work focused on one-round\ndifferentially private shuffle model protocols, demonstrating that\nfunctionalities such as addition and histograms can be performed in this model\nwith accuracy levels similar to that of the curator model of differential\nprivacy, where the computation is performed by a fully trusted party.\n  Focusing on the round complexity of the shuffle model, we ask in this work\nwhat can be computed in the shuffle model of differential privacy with two\nrounds. Ishai et al. [FOCS 2006] showed how to use one round of the shuffle to\nestablish secret keys between every two parties. Using this primitive to\nsimulate a general secure multi-party protocol increases its round complexity\nby one. We show how two parties can use one round of the shuffle to send secret\nmessages without having to first establish a secret key, hence retaining round\ncomplexity. Combining this primitive with the two-round semi-honest protocol of\nApplebaun et al. [TCC 2018], we obtain that every randomized functionality can\nbe computed in the shuffle model with an honest majority, in merely two rounds.\nThis includes any differentially private computation. We then move to examine\ndifferentially private computations in the shuffle model that (i) do not\nrequire the assumption of an honest majority, or (ii) do not admit one-round\nprotocols, even with an honest majority. For that, we introduce two\ncomputational tasks: the common-element problem and the nested-common-element\nproblem, for which we show separations between one-round and two-round\nprotocols.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Sep 2020 17:57:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-29"}

Such states were conceived as generalized\nWigner crystals (GWCs). In this article, we investigate the problem of Wigner\ncrystallization in the presence of an underlying (moir\\'e) lattice. Based on\nthe best estimates of the system parameters, we find a variety of homobilayer\nand heterobilayer TMDs to be excellent candidates for realizing GWCs. In\nparticular, our analysis based on $r_{s}$ indicates that $\\rm MoSe_{2}$ (among\nthe homobilayers) and $\\rm MoSe_2/WSe_2$ or $\\rm MoS_2/ WS_2$ (among the\nheterobilayers) are the best candidates for realizing GWCs. We also establish\nthat due to larger effective mass of the valence bands, in general,\nhole-crystals are easier to realize that electron-crystals as seen\nexperimentally. For completeness, we show that satisfying the Mott criterion\n$n_{\\rm Mott}^{1/2} a_{\\ast} = 1$ requires densities nearly three orders of\nmagnitude larger than the maximal density for GWC formation. This indicates\nthat for the typical density of operation, HoM or HeM systems are far from the\nMott insulating regime. These crystals realized on a moir\\'e lattice, unlike\nthe conventional Wigner crystals, are incompressible due the gap arising from\npinning with the lattice. Finally, we capture this many-body gap by\nvariationally renormalizing the dispersion of the vibration modes. We show\nthese low-energy modes, arising from coupling of the WC with the moir\\'e\nlattice, can be effectively modeled as a Sine-Gordon theory of fluctuations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Sep 2020 18:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Oct 2020 11:39:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-31"}

In this work, we study anomaly detection by considering the\ndetection of threshold crossings in a stochastic time series without the\nknowledge of its statistics. To reduce the sampling cost in this detection\nprocess, we propose the use of hierarchical generative adversarial networks\n(GANs) to perform nonuniform sampling. In order to improve the detection\naccuracy and reduce the delay in detection, we introduce a buffer zone in the\noperation of the proposed GAN-based detector. In the experiments, we analyze\nthe performance of the proposed hierarchical GAN detector considering the\nmetrics of detection delay, miss rates, average cost of error, and sampling\nratio. We identify the tradeoffs in the performance as the buffer zone sizes\nand the number of GAN levels in the hierarchy vary. We also compare the\nperformance with that of a sampling policy that approximately minimizes the sum\nof average costs of sampling and error given the parameters of the stochastic\nprocess. We demonstrate that the proposed GAN-based detector can have\nsignificant performance improvements in terms of detection delay and average\ncost of error with a larger buffer zone but at the cost of increased sampling\nrates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Sep 2020 19:39:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-30"}

Correlated electron systems often\nexhibit coupled degrees of freedom with a high degree of tunability which\nsometimes lead to hybridized functionalities based on external stimuli.\nHowever, the mechanisms of tunability and the sensitivity to external stimuli\nare determined by intrinsic material properties which are not always\ncontrollable.

This approach\ncombines a photoconductor, which does not exhibit an MIT, with a strongly\ncorrelated oxide, which is not photoconducting. Due to the close proximity\nbetween the two materials, the heterostructure exhibits large volatile and\nnonvolatile, photoinduced resistivity changes and substantial photoinduced\nshifts in the MIT transition temperatures. This approach can potentially be\nextended to other judiciously chosen combinations of strongly correlated\nmaterials with systems which exhibit optically, electrically or magnetically\ncontrollable behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Sep 2020 20:18:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-14"}

For the case $n\\geq 4$, he conjectured\nthat the minimizers are also certain generalized radial diffeomorphisms between\n$\\mathbb{A}$ and $\\mathbb{A_{*}}$.\n  The main aim of this paper is to consider this conjecture. First, we\ninvestigate the minimality of the following combined energy integral: $$\n\\mathbb{E}[a,b][h]\n=\\int_{\\mathbb{A}}\\frac{a^{2}\\rho^{n-1}(x)\\|DS(x)\\|^{n-1}+b^{2}|\\nabla\n\\rho(x)|^{n-1}}{|\\rho(x)|^{n-1}}dx, $$ where $h=\\rho S\\in\n\\mathcal{F}(\\mathbb{A},\\mathbb{A_{*}})$, $\\rho=|h|$ and $a,b>0$. The obtained\nresult is a generalization of \\cite[Theorem 1.1]{kalaj2018}. As an application,\nwe show that the above conjecture is almost true for the case $n\\geq 4$, i.e.,\nthe minimizer of the energy integral $\\mathcal{E}[h]$ does not exist but there\nexists a minimizing sequence which belongs to the generalized radial mappings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Sep 2020 20:43:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-30"}

Typically, as is the\ncase of wind speeds, data are available at few stations with many missing\nobservations and consequently simulated data are often used to augment\ninformation, due to simulated environmental data being available at high\nspatial and temporal resolutions. However, simulated data often mismatch\nobserved data, particularly at tails, therefore calibrating and bringing it in\nline with observed data may offer practitioners more reliable and richer data\nsources. Although the calibration methods that we describe in this manuscript\nmay equally apply to other environmental variables, we describe the methods\nspecifically with reference to wind data and its consequences.

Firstly, the feature refinement module which adaptively\nre-weights the feature channels is exploited in the encoder to capture more\ninformative features and discard information in irrelevant regions.\nFurthermore, we propose a multi-prediction guided attention mechanism which\nprovides pixel-wise semantic prediction guidance to better recover the\nsegmentation mask at each scale. This mechanism which transforms the deep\nsupervision to supervised attention is able to guide feature aggregation with\nmore semantic information between intermediate layers. Experiments on the\npublicly available Duke OCT dataset confirm the effectiveness of the proposed\nmethod as well as an improved performance over other state-of-the-art\napproaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Sep 2020 21:22:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-30"}

Current methods related to this task often\nleverage the power of deep neural networks, while a major challenge in fine\ntuning such models in medical applications arises from insufficient number of\nlabeled samples. To address this, we propose to regularize the knowledge\ntransfer across source and target tasks through cross-task representation\nlearning. The proposed method is demonstrated for extracting facial anatomical\nlandmarks which facilitate the diagnosis of fetal alcohol syndrome.

Coupling wake and top-down boundary layer models is particularly\nchallenging since the latter requires averaging over planform areas associated\nwith certain turbine-specific regions of the flow. The ALC model uses Voronoi\ntesselation to define a local area around each turbine. A top-down description\nof a developing internal boundary layers is then applied over Voronoi cells\nupstream of each turbine to estimate the local mean velocity profile. Coupling\nbetween the velocity at hub-height based on this localized top-down model and a\nwake model is achieved by enforcing a minimum least-square-error in mean\nvelocity in each cell. The ALC model is implemented using a wake model with a\nprofile that transitions from a top-hat to Gaussian function and accounts for\nwake interactions through linear superposition. Detailed comparisons to\nlarge-eddy simulation (LES) data demonstrate the efficacy of the model in\naccurate predictions of both power and hub height velocity for complex wind\nfarm geometries. Further validation with LES for a hybrid array-random farm\nthat has half of the turbines arranged in an array and the other half randomly\ndistributed indicates the model's versatility with respect to capturing results\nfrom different wind farm configurations.

Specifically, we derive the asymptotic\nresidual corresponding to the $\\ell_{1}$ optimization and show that it depends\non the noise variance. The proposed ARM approach obtains the estimate by\ncomparing the asymptotic residual with the actual one, which can be obtained by\nthe empirical reconstruction without the information of the noise variance. For\nthe proposed ARM, we also propose a method to choose a reasonable parameter on\nthe basis of the asymptotic residual as well.

By breaking the dependency of paired image-caption\ntraining data in VLP, VIVO can leverage large amounts of paired image-tag data\nto learn a visual vocabulary.

However, real-time video streaming to a receiver outside\nthe body remains challenging for capsule endoscopy. Traditional\nelectromagnetic-based solutions are limited in their data rates and available\npower. Recently, ultrasound was investigated as a communication channel for\nthrough-tissue data transmission. To achieve real-time video streaming through\ntissue, data rates of ultrasound need to exceed 1 Mbps. In a previous study, we\ndemonstrated ultrasound communications with data rates greater than 30 Mbps\nwith two focused ultrasound transducers using a large footprint laboratory\nsystem through slabs of lossy tissues [1]. While the form factor of the\ntransmitter is also crucial for capsule endoscopy, it is obvious that a large,\nfocused transducer cannot fit within the size of a capsule. Several other\nchallenges for achieving high-speed ultrasonic communication through tissue\ninclude strong reflections leading to multipath effects and attenuation. In\nthis work, we demonstrate ultrasonic video communications using a mm-scale\nmicrocrystal transmitter with video streaming supplied by a camera connected to\na Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). The signals were transmitted through a\ntissue-mimicking phantom and through the abdomen of a rabbit in vivo.

The\ncurrent advancements in machine learning and sensor technology have made SHM a\nmore promising damage detection method than the traditional non-destructive\ntesting methods. SHM using unsupervised learning methods offers an attractive\nalternative to the more commonly used supervised learning since it only\nrequires data of the structure in normal conditions for the training process.\nThe density-based novelty detection method provides a statistical element to\nthe damage detection process but it relies heavily on the accuracy of the\nestimated probability density function (PDF). In this study, a novel\nunsupervised learning approach for SHM is proposed. It is based on the Kernel\nDensity Maximum Entropy method by leveraging Bayesian optimization for\nhyperparameter tuning and also by extending the method into the multivariate\nspace by the use of independent components analysis. The proposed approach is\nevaluated on a numerically simulated three-story reinforced concrete moment\nframe, where 94% of accuracy is achieved in structural damage detection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Sep 2020 23:58:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-30"}

It can obtain high\neconomic efficiency and user flexibility by allowing bidders to submit bids for\ncombinations of different items instead of only for individual items. However,\nthe problem of allocating items among the bidders to maximize the auctioneers\"\nrevenue, i.e., the winner determination problem (WDP), is NP-complete to solve\nand inapproximable. Existing works for WDPs are generally based on mathematical\noptimization techniques and most of them focus on the single-unit WDP, where\neach item only has one unit. On the contrary, few works consider the multi-unit\nWDP in which each item may have multiple units. Given that the multi-unit WDP\nis more complicated but prevalent in cloud computing, we propose leveraging\nmachine learning (ML) techniques to develop a novel low-complexity algorithm\nfor solving this problem with negligible revenue loss. Specifically, we model\nthe multi-unit WDP as an augmented bipartite bid-item graph and use a graph\nneural network (GNN) with half-convolution operations to learn the probability\nof each bid belonging to the optimal allocation. To improve the sample\ngeneration efficiency and decrease the number of needed labeled instances, we\npropose two different sample generation processes. We also develop two novel\ngraph-based post-processing algorithms to transform the outputs of the GNN into\nfeasible solutions.

While many techniques have been\nproposed to enhance ER by biasing how experiences are sampled from the buffer,\nthus far they have not considered strategies for refreshing experiences inside\nthe buffer. In this work, we introduce Lucid Dreaming for Experience Replay\n(LiDER), a conceptually new framework that allows replay experiences to be\nrefreshed by leveraging the agent's current policy. LiDER consists of three\nsteps: First, LiDER moves an agent back to a past state. Second, from that\nstate, LiDER then lets the agent execute a sequence of actions by following its\ncurrent policy -- as if the agent were \"dreaming\" about the past and can try\nout different behaviors to encounter new experiences in the dream. Third, LiDER\nstores and reuses the new experience if it turned out better than what the\nagent previously experienced, i.e., to refresh its memories. LiDER is designed\nto be easily incorporated into off-policy, multi-worker RL algorithms that use\nER; we present in this work a case study of applying LiDER to an actor-critic\nbased algorithm. Results show LiDER consistently improves performance over the\nbaseline in six Atari 2600 games.

In a 2017 conference paper, we introduced\nDABA, the first algorithm for sliding-window aggregation with worst-case\nconstant time. Before DABA, if a window had size $n$, the best published\nalgorithms would require $O(\\log n)$ aggregation steps per window\noperation---and while for strictly in-order streams, this bound could be\nimproved to $O(1)$ aggregation steps on average, it was not known how to\nachieve an $O(1)$ bound for the worst-case, which is critical for\nlatency-sensitive applications.\n  This article is an extended version of our 2017 paper. Besides describing\nDABA in more detail, this article introduces a new variant, DABA Lite, which\nachieves the same time bounds in less memory.

Moreover, the\nanalysis of probabilistic potential and mean first-passage time reveals the\nresilience of alternative steady states. We also describe the efficacy of a few\ngeneric indicators in forecasting sudden transitions. Furthermore, we show that\nincorporating social norms on the model allows moderate fish density to\nmaintain despite higher harvesting rates. Overall, our study highlights the\noccurrence of critical transitions in a stochastic social-ecological model and\nsuggests ways to mitigate them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Sep 2020 04:29:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-17"}

Using the technique of\nspherical local frame, we give an exact and explicit answer for the question\nwhen $F=r\\sqrt{2f(t)}$ really defines a Minkowski norm.

The\nreason is that traffic can break down drastically during the early morning\ncommute, and the time and duration of this break-down vary substantially from\nday to day. Early morning traffic forecast is crucial to inform morning-commute\ntraffic management, but they are generally challenging to predict in advance,\nparticularly by midnight. In this paper, we propose to mine Twitter messages as\na probing method to understand the impacts of people's work and rest patterns\nin the evening/midnight of the previous day to the next-day morning traffic.\nThe model is tested on freeway networks in Pittsburgh as experiments. The\nresulting relationship is surprisingly simple and powerful. We find that, in\ngeneral, the earlier people rest as indicated from Tweets, the more congested\nroads will be in the next morning. The occurrence of big events in the evening\nbefore, represented by higher or lower tweet sentiment than normal, often\nimplies lower travel demand in the next morning than normal days. Besides,\npeople's tweeting activities in the night before and early morning are\nstatistically associated with congestion in morning peak hours. We make use of\nsuch relationships to build a predictive framework which forecasts morning\ncommute congestion using people's tweeting profiles extracted by 5 am or as\nlate as the midnight prior to the morning. The Pittsburgh study supports that\nour framework can precisely predict morning congestion, particularly for some\nroad segments upstream of roadway bottlenecks with large day-to-day congestion\nvariation. Our approach considerably outperforms those existing methods without\nTwitter message features, and it can learn meaningful representation of demand\nfrom tweeting profiles that offer managerial insights.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Sep 2020 06:02:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 2021 17:56:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 29 Dec 2021 23:03:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-03"}

Our\nmethod tackles all these tasks in a single multi-stage framework without any\nassumptions. In the first stage, we train a 3D Fully Convolutional Networks to\nfind the bounding boxes of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar vertebrae.

The input to the second networks have\nan auxiliary channel in addition to the 3D CT images. Given the segmented\nvertebra regions in the auxiliary channel, the networks output the next\nvertebra. The proposed method is evaluated in terms of segmentation,\nlocalization, and identification accuracy with two public datasets of 15 3D CT\nimages from the MICCAI CSI 2014 workshop challenge and 302 3D CT images with\nvarious pathologies introduced in [1].

In this paper, we provide an explicit convex\noptimization example where training the BNNs with the traditionally adaptive\noptimization methods still faces the risk of non-convergence, and identify that\nconstraining the range of gradients is critical for optimizing the deep binary\nmodel to avoid highly suboptimal solutions. For solving above issues, we\npropose a BAMSProd algorithm with a key observation that the convergence\nproperty of optimizing deep binary model is strongly related to the\nquantization errors. In brief, it employs an adaptive range constraint via an\nerrors measurement for smoothing the gradients transition while follows the\nexponential moving strategy from AMSGrad to avoid errors accumulation during\nthe optimization. The experiments verify the corollary of theoretical\nconvergence analysis, and further demonstrate that our optimization method can\nspeed up the convergence about 1:2x and boost the performance of BNNs to a\nsignificant level than the specific binary optimizer about 3:7%, even in a\nhighly non-convex optimization problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Sep 2020 06:12:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-30"}

To tackle this issue, we propose a novel method of designing\nself-grouping convolutional neural networks, called SG-CNN, in which the\nfilters of each convolutional layer group themselves based on the similarity of\ntheir importance vectors. Concretely, for each filter, we first evaluate the\nimportance value of their input channels to identify the importance vectors,\nand then group these vectors by clustering. Using the resulting\n\\emph{data-dependent} centroids, we prune the less important connections, which\nimplicitly minimizes the accuracy loss of the pruning, thus yielding a set of\n\\emph{diverse} group convolution filters. Subsequently, we develop two\nfine-tuning schemes, i.e. (1) both local and global fine-tuning and (2) global\nonly fine-tuning, which experimentally deliver comparable results, to recover\nthe recognition capacity of the pruned network. Comprehensive experiments\ncarried out on the CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet datasets demonstrate that our\nself-grouping convolution method adapts to various state-of-the-art CNN\narchitectures, such as ResNet and DenseNet, and delivers superior performance\nin terms of compression ratio, speedup and recognition accuracy. We demonstrate\nthe ability of SG-CNN to generalise by transfer learning, including domain\nadaption and object detection, showing competitive results.

We wish to understand when is it feasible for an adversarial observer\nto reverse-engineer the parameters of tasks being performed by a team of robots\nby simply observing their positions. We address this question by using the\nconcept of persistency of excitation from system identification. Each robot in\nthe team uses optimization-based controllers for mediating between task\nsatisfaction and collision avoidance. These controllers exhibit an implicit\ndependence on the task's parameters which poses a hurdle for deriving necessary\nconditions for parameter identification, since such conditions usually require\nan explicit relation. We address this bottleneck by using duality theory and\nSVD of active collision avoidance constraints and derive an explicit relation\nbetween each robot's task parameters and its control inputs. This allows us to\nderive the main necessary conditions for successful identification which agree\nwith our intuition. We demonstrate the importance of these conditions through\nnumerical simulations by using (a) an adaptive observer and (b) an unscented\nKalman filter for goal estimation in various geometric settings. These\nsimulations show that under circumstances where parameter inference is supposed\nto be infeasible per our conditions, both these estimators fail and likewise\nwhen it is feasible, both converge to the true parameters.

We first propose a detailed channel model for aerial\nTHz communications taking into account both the non-flat Earth geometry and the\nmain features of the frequency-selective THz channel. We then apply this model\nto estimate the characteristics of aerial THz links in different conditions. We\nfinally determine the altitudes where the use of airplane-to-satellite THz\nconnection becomes preferable over the airplane-to-ground THz link. Our results\nreveal that the capacity of the airborne THz link may reach up to 120 Gbit/s,\nthus enabling cellular-equivalent data rates to the passengers and staff during\nthe entire flight.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Sep 2020 07:39:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-30"}

This\napproach suffices for common and perennial themes like \"white shirt\" or\n\"lifestyle image of TV\". It does not work for new themes such as\n\"e-cigarettes\", hard-to-define ones such as \"image with a promotional badge\",\nor the ones with short relevance span such as \"Halloween costumes\". SIR is\nideal for such cases because it allows us to search by an example, not a\npre-defined theme. We describe the steps - embedding computation, encoding, and\nindexing - that power the approximate nearest neighbor search back-end. We also\nhighlight two applications of SIR. The first one is related to the detection of\nproducts with various types of potentially objectionable themes. This\napplication is run with a sense of urgency, hence the typical time frame to\ntrain and bootstrap a model is not permitted.

To avoid prohibitive training times, sampling\nmethods select small subsets of the training data on which SVDD trains a\ndecision boundary hopefully equivalent to the one obtained on the full data\nset. According to the literature, a good sample should therefore contain\nso-called boundary observations that SVDD would select as support vectors on\nthe full data set. However, non-boundary observations also are essential to not\nfragment contiguous inlier regions and avoid poor classification accuracy.\nOther aspects, such as selecting a sufficiently representative sample, are\nimportant as well. But existing sampling methods largely overlook them,\nresulting in poor classification accuracy. In this article, we study how to\nselect a sample considering these points. Our approach is to frame SVDD\nsampling as an optimization problem, where constraints guarantee that sampling\nindeed approximates the original decision boundary.

The main idea of our proposed solution\nis to create trusted user profiles fetched from the Queries submitted by\nauthorized users by using association rules. After that we will use a hybrid\n(anomaly + misuse) detection model which will depend on data mining techniques\nto detect queries that deviates from our normal behavior profile. The normal\nbehavior profile will be created in XML format. In this way we can minimize\nfalse positive alarms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Sep 2020 08:46:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-30"}

In this paper, we present the first\nweakly-supervised approach to the SID problem. Although weak supervision has\nbeen considered in general saliency detection, it is mainly based on using\nclass labels for object localization. However, it is non-trivial to use only\nclass labels to learn instance-aware saliency information, as salient instances\nwith high semantic affinities may not be easily separated by the labels. We\nnote that subitizing information provides an instant judgement on the number of\nsalient items, which naturally relates to detecting salient instances and may\nhelp separate instances of the same class while grouping different parts of the\nsame instance. Inspired by this insight, we propose to use class and subitizing\nlabels as weak supervision for the SID problem. We propose a novel\nweakly-supervised network with three branches: a Saliency Detection Branch\nleveraging class consistency information to locate candidate objects; a\nBoundary Detection Branch exploiting class discrepancy information to delineate\nobject boundaries; and a Centroid Detection Branch using subitizing information\nto detect salient instance centroids.

It has recently been found that substantial power gains can be\nobtained by tilting the rotors of spanwise-periodic wind-turbine arrays. Rotor\ntilt is associated to the generation of coherent streamwise vortices which\ndeflect wakes towards the ground and, by exploiting the vertical wind shear,\nreplace them with higher-momentum fluid (high-speed streaks). The objective of\nthis work is to evaluate power gains that can be obtained by tilting rotors in\nspanwise-periodic wind-turbine arrays immersed in the atmospheric boundary\nlayer and, in particular, to analyze the influence of the rotor size on power\ngains in the case where the turbines emerge from the atmospheric surface layer.\nWe show that, for the case of wind-aligned arrays, large power gains can be\nobtained for positive tilt angles of the order of 30{\\deg}. Power gains are\nsubstantially enhanced by operating tilted-rotor turbines at thrust\ncoefficients higher than in the reference configuration. These power gains\ninitially increase with the rotor size reaching a maximum for rotor diameters\nof the order of 3.6 boundary layer momentum thicknesses (for the considered\ncases) and decrease for larger sizes. Maximum power gains are obtained for\nwind-turbine spanwise spacings which are very similar to those of large-scale\nand very large scale streaky motions which are naturally amplified in turbulent\nboundary layers.

A two-dimensional\nsimulation model that studies the propagation of light and heat transfer in\nbrain tissue based on finite element has been developed by using the commercial\nfinite element simulation software COMSOL Multiphysics. In this study, the\nmodel consists of three parts of 1) a layer of water on the surface of the\nbrain, 2) brain tissue and 3) short pulsed laser source (the wavelength is\n840nm). The laser point source is located in the middle of the layer of water\nabove the brain tissue and irradiates the brain tissue. The propagation of\nlight in brain tissue was simulated by solving the diffusion equation. And the\ntemperature changes of gray matter and blood vessels were achieved by solving\nthe biological heat transfer equation. The simulation results show that the\nlight energy in the brain tissue decreases exponentially with the increase of\npenetration depth. Since the cerebral blood vessels have a stronger absorption\non light compared with the surrounding tissues, the remaining light energy of\nthe blood vessels in the cerebral cortex is ~ 85.8% of the remaining light\nenergy in the surrounding gray matter. In the process of biological heat\ntransfer, due to more light deposition in blood vessels, the temperature of\nblood vessels is 0.15 K higher than that of gray matter, and the temperature of\ngray matter hardly changes. This research is helpful to understand the\npropagation of light in the brain and the interaction between them, and has\ncertain theoretical guiding for the optical imaging of the brain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Sep 2020 09:58:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-30"}

The RADAR/LIDAR\nand camera based methods currently used for vehicle localization do not satisfy\nthese requirements, necessitating complementary technologies. Visible light\npositioning (VLP) is a highly suitable complementary technology due to its high\naccuracy and high rate, exploiting the line-of-sight propagation feature of the\nvisible light communication (VLC) signals from LED head/tail lights. However,\nexisting vehicular VLP algorithms impose restrictive requirements, e.g., use of\nhigh-bandwidth circuits, road-side lights and certain VLC modulation\nstrategies, and work for limited relative vehicle orientations, thus, are not\nfeasible for general use. This paper proposes a VLC-based vehicle localization\nmethod that eliminates these restrictive requirements by a novel VLC receiver\ndesign and associated vehicular VLP algorithm. The VLC receiver, named QRX, is\nlow-cost/size, and enables high-rate VLC and high-accuracy angle-of-arrival\n(AoA) measurement, simultaneously, via the usage of a quadrant photodiode. The\nVLP algorithm estimates the positions of two head/tail light VLC transmitters\n(TX) on a neighbouring vehicle by using AoA measurements from two QRXs for\nlocalization. The algorithm is theoretically analyzed by deriving its\nCramer-Rao lower bound on positioning accuracy, and simulated localization\nperformance is evaluated under realistic platooning and collision avoidance\nscenarios. Results demonstrate that the proposed method performs at cm-level\naccuracy and up to 250 Hz rate within a 10 m range under realistic harsh road\nand channel conditions, demonstrating its eligibility for collision avoidance\nand safe platooning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Sep 2020 10:10:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 14:27:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-01"}

Based on data from a pilot or\npreliminary study, the tool, which is available online as a shiny app\n\\citep{shinyR}, can be used to compute: (1) the sample size required for a\nstatistical power analysis, while optimizing the percent of participants who\nshould provide direct measures of exposure (biomarkers) in addition to the\nindirect (self-report) measures provided by all participants; (2) the ideal\nnumber of replicates; and (3) the allocation of resources to intervention and\ncontrol arms. In addition we show how to examine the sensitivity of results to\nunderlying assumptions. We illustrate our analysis using studies of tobacco\nsmoke exposure and nutrition.

Here, we use a similar approach to\ncharacterize the secondary processes, namely thermal metamorphism and aqueous\nalteration, that have affected carbonaceous chondrites. X-ray absorption\nnear-edge structure spectroscopy at the Fe-K- edge was performed on a series of\n36 CM, 9 CR, 10 CV, and 2 CI chondrites. Among the four carbonaceous chondrites\ngroups studied, a correlation between the iron oxidation index (IOI = [2\n((Fe2+) + 3(Fe3+))/FeTOT) and the hydrogen content is observed. However, within\nthe CM group, for which a progressive alteration sequence has been defined, a\nconversion of Fe3+ to Fe2+ is observed with increasing degree of aqueous\nalteration. This reduction of iron can be explained by an evolution in the\nmineralogy of the secondary phases. In the case of the few CM chondrites that\nexperienced some thermal metamorphism, in addition to aqueous alteration, a\nredox memory of the aqueous alteration is present: a significant fraction of 3+\n2+ 0 Fe is present, together with Fe and sometimes Fe. From our data set, the\nCR chondrites show a wider range of IOI from 1.5 to 2.5. In all considered CR\nchondrites, the three oxidation states of iron coexist. Even in the\nleast-altered CR chondrites, the fraction of Fe3+ can be high (30% for MET\n00426). This observation confirms that oxidized iron has been integrated during\nformation of fine-grained amorphous material in the matrix. Last, the IOI of CV\nchondrites does not reflect the reduced/oxidized classification based on metal\nand magnetite proportions, but is strongly correlated with petrographic types.\nThe valence of iron in CV chondrites therefore appears to be most closely\nrelated to thermal history, rather than aqueous alteration, even if these\nprocesses can occur together .\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Sep 2020 12:14:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Apr 2021 06:41:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-02"}

While two compositional\ntasks are trivially solved with our approach, we also find that the other tasks\nremain unsolved, validating the relevance of gSCAN as a benchmark for\nevaluating models' compositional abilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Sep 2020 12:27:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2020 07:11:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-02"}

Unlike existing encoder-decoder-based image deraining\nmodels that improve performance with additional branches, MCW-Net improves\nperformance by maximizing information utilization without additional branches\nthrough the following two proposed methods. The first method is a multi-level\nconnection that repeatedly connects multi-level features of the encoder network\nto the decoder network. Multi-level connection encourages the decoding process\nto use the feature information of all levels. In multi-level connection,\nchannel-wise attention is considered to learn which level of features is\nimportant in the decoding process of the current level.

The circular motion\ntakes place for a fixed radius, while radii are continuously distributed along\nthe circle. Two scenarios of the anomalous transport, related to the reflecting\nand periodic angular boundary conditions, are studied. The first scenario with\nthe reflection boundary conditions for the circular diffusion corresponds to\nthe conformal mapping of a 2D comb Fokker-Planck equation on the circular comb.\nThis topologically constraint motion is named umbrella comb model. In this\ncase, the reflecting boundary conditions are imposed on the circular (rotator)\nmotion, while the radial motion corresponds to geometric Brownian motion with\nvanishing to zero boundary conditions on infinity. The radial diffusion is\ndescribed by the log-normal distribution, which corresponds to exponentially\nfast motion with the mean squared displacement (MSD) of the order of $e^t$. The\nsecond scenario corresponds to the circular diffusion with periodic boundary\nconditions and the outward radial diffusion with vanishing to zero boundary\nconditions at infinity. In this case the radial motion corresponds to normal\ndiffusion.

After correcting the effect of different optical path lengths, a spatial\ndistribution of HCN emissions is derived over Neptune's disk, and it clearly\nshows a band-like HCN enhancement at the equator.

From the\nmeridional circulation point of view, the observed HCN enhancement on both the\nequator and the pole can be explained by the production and accumulation of HCN\nat the downward branches of the previously suggested two-cell meridional\ncirculation models. However, the HCN-depleted latitude of 60 S does not match\nwith the location of the upward branch of the two-cell circulation models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Sep 2020 14:58:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-11"}

In\npractice, these signals are often acquired to extract some underlying\ninformation, i.e., for a specific task. Employing conventional task-agnostic\nanalog-to-digital converters (ADCs), typically designed to minimize the mean\nsquared error (MSE) in reconstructing the CT input signal, can be costly and\nenergy-inefficient in such cases. In this work, we study task-based ADCs, which\nare designed to obtain a digital representation of a multivariate CT input\nprocess with the goal of recovering an underlying statistically related\nparameter vector, referred to as \\emph{the task}. The proposed system employs\nanalog filtering, uniform sampling, and scalar uniform quantization of the\ninput process before recovering the task vector using a linear digital recovery\nfilter. We optimize the analog and digital filters and derive closed-form\nexpressions for the achievable MSE in recovering the task vector from a set of\nanalog signals when utilizing ADCs with a fixed sampling rate and amplitude\nresolution. Based on our derivation, we provide guidelines for designing\npractical acquisition systems subject to a constraint on the bit rate. Our\nanalysis proves that the intuitive approaches of either recovering the task\nvector solely in digital or designing the analog filter to estimate the task\nvector are inferior to the proposed joint design. We then consider the recovery\nof a set of matched filter outputs under a rate budget. We numerically verify\nour theoretical observations and demonstrate that task-based ADCs substantially\noutperform analog matched filtering as well as applying the matched filter\nsolely in the digital domain.

The oscillatory behavior of the STT in Mn$_3$Ga is robust\nagainst variations in the stack geometry and the applied bias voltage, which\nmay affect the phase and the amplitude of the spatial oscillation, but the wave\nnumber is only responsive to variations in the longitudinal lattice constant of\nMn$_3$Ga (for fixed in-plane geometry) without being commensurate with the\nlattice. Our interpretation of the long-range STT oscillations is based on the\nbulk electronic structure of Mn$_3$Ga, taking also into account the\nspin-filtering properties of the MgO barrier. Comparison to a fully\nMn$_3$Ga-based stack shows similar STT oscillations, but a significant\nenhancement of both the TMR effect at the Fermi level and the STT at the\ninterface, due to resonant tunneling for the mirror-symmetric junction with\nthinner barrier (three monoatomic layers).

For a given spatial domain\ninside which the effective diffusion can emerge, a time constant related to the\ndiffusion is identified by considering the spatio-temporal evolution of a test\nadvection-diffusion equation, where its initial condition is set at a pulse\nfunction. Then, the value of effective diffusivity is identified by minimizing\nthe $L_\\infty$ distance between solutions of the above test equation and the\ndiffusion one with mean drift.

In this\npaper, we propose a new deep learning video compression architecture that does\nnot require motion estimation, which is the most expensive element of modern\nhybrid video compression codecs like H.264 and HEVC. Our framework exploits the\nregularities inherent to video motion, which we capture by using displaced\nframe differences as video representations to train the neural network. In\naddition, we propose a new space-time reconstruction network based on both an\nLSTM model and a UNet model, which we call LSTM-UNet. The new video compression\nframework has three components: a Displacement Calculation Unit (DCU), a\nDisplacement Compression Network (DCN), and a Frame Reconstruction Network\n(FRN). The DCU removes the need for motion estimation found in hybrid codecs\nand is less expensive. In the DCN, an RNN-based network is utilized to compress\ndisplaced frame differences as well as retain temporal information between\nframes. The LSTM-UNet is used in the FRN to learn space-time differential\nrepresentations of videos.

The decentralized exploration implies that each agent carries out\ntheir exploration task independently in the absence of any supervisory\nagent/computer. When an agent encounters another agent within a communication\nrange, each agent receives the information about which areas are already\ncovered by other agents, yielding a collaborative exploration.

The\npaper tests theoretical statistical distributions against empirical data for\nthe costs of the Games, in order to explain the cost risks faced by host cities\nand nations. It is documented, for the first time, that cost and cost overrun\nfor the Games follow a power-law distribution. Olympic costs are subject to\ninfinite mean and variance, with dire consequences for predictability and\nplanning.

The power law explains why the Games are so difficult to plan and\nmanage successfully, and why cities and nations should think twice before\nbidding to host.

This pathology is\nmainly caused by viruses or bacteria. X-rays imaging analysis is one of the\nmost used methods for pneumonia diagnosis. These clinical images can be\nanalyzed using machine learning methods such as convolutional neural networks\n(CNN), which learn to extract critical features for the classification.\nHowever, the usability of these systems is limited in medicine due to the lack\nof interpretability, because of these models cannot be used to generate an\nunderstandable explanation (from a human-based perspective), about how they\nhave reached those results. Another problem that difficults the impact of this\ntechnology is the limited amount of labeled data in many medicine domains. The\nmain contributions of this work are two fold: the first one is the design of a\nnew explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) technique based on combining the\nindividual heatmaps obtained from each model in the ensemble. This allows to\novercome the explainability and interpretability problems of the CNN \"black\nboxes\", highlighting those areas of the image which are more relevant to\ngenerate the classification.
