BT and BLE have dedicated pairing protocols and devices\nhave to pair over BT and BLE to use both securely. In 2014, the Bluetooth\nstandard (v4.2) addressed this usability issue by introducing Cross-Transport\nKey Derivation (CTKD). CTKD allows establishing BT and BLE pairing keys just by\npairing over one of the two transports. While CTKD crosses the security\nboundary between BT and BLE, little is known about the internals of CTKD and\nits security implications.\n  In this work, we present the first complete description of CTKD obtained by\nmerging the scattered information from the Bluetooth standard with the results\nfrom our reverse-engineering experiments. Then, we perform a security\nevaluation of CTKD and uncover four cross-transport issues in its\nspecification. We leverage these issues to design four standard-compliant\nattacks on CTKD enabling new ways to exploit Bluetooth (e.g., exploiting BT and\nBLE by targeting only one of the two). Our attacks work even if the strongest\nsecurity mechanism for BT and BLE are in place, including Numeric Comparison\nand Secure Connections. They allow to impersonate, man-in-the-middle, and\nestablish unintended sessions with arbitrary devices.

For network\nevolution, incoming links are added to a node or deleted, depending on the\nnode's average activity.

The observed exponents are in accord with criticality as predicted\nby dynamical scaling theory, as well as with the observed exponents of neural\navalanches. The critical state of the model is reached autonomously without\nneed for parameter tuning, is independent of initial conditions, is robust\nunder stochastic noise, and independent of details of the implementation as\ndifferent variants of the model indicate.

In this paper, by performing an in-depth analysis,\nfirst we show that the FPR advantage of standard Bloom filters is smaller than\nthought; more importantly, by studying the per-element FPR, we show that\nstandard Bloom filters have weak spots in the domain: elements which will be\ntested as false positives much more frequently than expected. This is relevant\nin scenarios where an element is tested against many filters, e.g., in packet\nforwarding. Moreover, standard Bloom filters are prone to exhibit extremely\nweak spots if naive double hashing is used, something occurring in several,\neven mainstream, libraries. Partitioned Bloom filters exhibit a uniform\ndistribution of the FPR over the domain and are robust to the naive use of\ndouble hashing, having no weak spots.

It,\ntherefore, remains an important task to identify the most accurate, while\ncomputationally economic, Hamiltonian formulation(s) in such theories,\nconsidering the necessary truncation imposed on the Hilbert space of gauge\nbosons with any finite computing resources. This paper is a first step toward\naddressing this question in the case of non-Abelian LGTs, which further require\nthe imposition of non-Abelian Gauss's laws on the Hilbert space, introducing\nadditional computational complexity. Focusing on the case of SU(2) LGT in 1+1 D\ncoupled to matter, a number of different formulations of the original\nKogut-Susskind framework are analyzed with regard to the dependence of the\ndimension of the physical Hilbert space on boundary conditions, system's size,\nand the cutoff on the excitations of gauge bosons. The impact of such\ndependencies on the accuracy of the spectrum and dynamics is examined, and the\n(classical) computational-resource requirements given these considerations are\nstudied. Besides the well-known angular-momentum formulation of the theory, the\ncases of purely fermionic and purely bosonic formulations (with open boundary\nconditions), and the Loop-String-Hadron formulation are analyzed, along with a\nbrief discussion of a Quantum Link Model of the same theory. Clear advantages\nare found in working with the Loop-String-Hadron framework which implements\nnon-Abelian Gauss's laws a priori using a complete set of gauge-invariant\noperators.

Therefore, we focus on the question of whether the combination of\nthe local, nonlocal electrical, and thermal conductance can separate the good,\nbad, and ugly zero-bias conductance peaks in finite-length wires. Our paper\naims to provide a guide to future experiments, and we conclude that a\ncombination of all three measurements would be necessary for a decisive\ndemonstration of topological Majorana zero modes in nanowires -- positive\nsignals corresponding to just one kind of measurements are likely to be false\npositives arising from disorder and inhomogeneous potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Sep 2020 16:49:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2020 19:23:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 24 Jan 2021 05:01:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-27"}

However, in real-world situations, we cannot assume that the\nlabeling process is infallible, and the accuracy of many SSL classifiers\ndecreases significantly in the presence of label noise. In this work, we\nintroduce the LGC_LVOF, a leave-one-out filtering approach based on the Local\nand Global Consistency (LGC) algorithm. Our method aims to detect and remove\nwrong labels, and thus can be used as a preprocessing step to any SSL\nclassifier. Given the propagation matrix, detecting noisy labels takes O(cl)\nper step, with c the number of classes and l the number of labels. Moreover,\none does not need to compute the whole propagation matrix, but only an $l$ by\n$l$ submatrix corresponding to interactions between labeled instances. As a\nresult, our approach is best suited to datasets with a large amount of\nunlabeled data but not many labels. Results are provided for a number of\ndatasets, including MNIST and ISOLET. LGCLVOF appears to be equally or more\nprecise than the adapted gradient-based filter.

To address this challenging\ntask, most ZSL methods relate unseen test classes to seen(training) classes via\na pre-defined set of attributes that can describe all classes in the same\nsemantic space, so the knowledge learned on the training classes can be adapted\nto unseen classes. In this paper, we aim to optimize the attribute space for\nZSL by training a propagation mechanism to refine the semantic attributes of\neach class based on its neighbors and related classes on a graph of classes. We\nshow that the propagated attributes can produce classifiers for zero-shot\nclasses with significantly improved performance in different ZSL settings. The\ngraph of classes is usually free or very cheap to acquire such as WordNet or\nImageNet classes. When the graph is not provided, given pre-defined semantic\nembeddings of the classes, we can learn a mechanism to generate the graph in an\nend-to-end manner along with the propagation mechanism. However, this\ngraph-aided technique has not been well-explored in the literature. In this\npaper, we introduce the attribute propagation network (APNet), which is\ncomposed of 1) a graph propagation model generating attribute vector for each\nclass and 2) a parameterized nearest neighbor (NN) classifier categorizing an\nimage to the class with the nearest attribute vector to the image's embedding.\nFor better generalization over unseen classes, different from previous methods,\nwe adopt a meta-learning strategy to train the propagation mechanism and the\nsimilarity metric for the NN classifier on multiple sub-graphs, each associated\nwith a classification task over a subset of training classes. In experiments\nwith two zero-shot learning settings and five benchmark datasets, APNet\nachieves either compelling performance or new state-of-the-art results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Sep 2020 16:53:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-25"}

Established techniques use\nattenuated lasers as weak coherent pulse (WCP) sources, with so-called\ndecoy-state protocols, to generate the required single-photon-level pulses.\nWhile such approaches are elegant, they come at the expense of attainable final\nkey due to inherent multi-photon emission, thereby constraining secure key\ngeneration over the high-loss, noisy channels expected for satellite\ntransmissions. In this work we improve on this limitation by using true\nsingle-photon pulses generated from a semiconductor quantum dot (QD) embedded\nin a nanowire, possessing low multi-photon emission ($<10^{-6}$) and an\nextraction system efficiency of -15 dB (or 3.1%). Despite the limited\nefficiency, the key generated by the QD source is greater than that generated\nby a WCP source under identical repetition rate and link conditions\nrepresentative of a satellite pass. We predict that with realistic improvements\nof the QD extraction efficiency to -4.0 dB (or 40%), the quantum-dot QKD\nprotocol outperforms WCP-decoy-state QKD by almost an order of magnitude.\nConsequently, a QD source could allow generation of a secure key in conditions\nwhere a WCP source would simply fail, such as in the case of high channel\nlosses.

We find that in this\ntightly packed system, stability can place upper limits on the masses and\norbital eccentricities of the bodies that are comparable to or tighter than\ncurrent state of the art methods. Specifically, stability places 68% upper\nlimits on the orbital eccentricities of 0.09, 0.04, and 0.05 for planets $b$,\n$c$ and $d$, respectively. These constraints correspond to radial velocity\nsignals $\\lesssim 20$ cm/s, are significantly tighter to those from transit\ndurations, and comparable to those from TTVs.

For the more\ngeneral unrelated machines model ($R|HM|C_{\\max}$), we show that if either the\nlargest job size $p_{\\max}$, or the number of jobs $n$ are polynomially bounded\nin the instance size $|I|$, there are algorithms with complexity\n$|I|^{\\textrm{poly}(k)}$. Our main result is that this is unlikely to be\nimproved, because $Q||C_{\\max}$ is W[1]-hard parameterized by $k$ already when\n$n$, $p_{\\max}$, and the numbers describing the speeds are polynomial in $|I|$;\nthe same holds for $R|HM|C_{\\max}$ (without speeds) when the job sizes matrix\nhas rank $2$. Our positive and negative results also extend to the objectives\n$\\ell_2$-norm minimization of the load vector and, partially, sum of weighted\ncompletion times $\\sum w_j C_j$.\n  Along the way, we answer affirmatively the question whether makespan\nminimization on identical machines ($P||C_{\\max}$) is fixed-parameter tractable\nparameterized by $k$, extending our understanding of this fundamental problem.\nTogether with our hardness results for $Q||C_{\\max}$ this implies that the\ncomplexity of $P|HM|C_{\\max}$ is the only remaining open case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Sep 2020 17:38:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-25"}

In addition, we have an intermediary who knows the\nbuyers' private values, and can map these to a public signal so as to increase\nconsumer surplus. This model generalizes the single-buyer setting proposed by\nBergemann, Brooks, and Morris, who present a signaling scheme that raises the\noptimal consumer surplus, by guaranteeing that the item is always sold and the\nseller gets the same revenue as without signaling. Our work aims to understand\nhow this result ports to the setting with multiple buyers.\n  We likewise define the benchmark for the optimal consumer surplus: one where\nthe auction is efficient (i.e., the item is always sold to the highest-valued\nbuyer) and the revenue of the seller is unchanged. We show that no signaling\nscheme can guarantee this benchmark even for $n=2$ buyers with $2$-point\nvaluation distributions. Indeed, no signaling scheme can be efficient while\npreserving any non-trivial fraction of the original consumer surplus, and no\nsignaling scheme can guarantee consumer surplus better than a factor of\n$\\frac{1}{2}$ compared to the benchmark. These impossibility results are\nexistential (beyond computational), and provide a sharp separation between the\nsingle and multi-buyer settings.\n  In light of this impossibility, we develop signaling schemes with good\napproximation guarantees to the benchmark.

However, most of the existing literature focuses\neither on Archimedean lattice cones or on closed proper cones in\nfinite-dimensional spaces, thereby excluding many cones, including even\nstandard cones such as an infinite-dimensional positive semidefinite cone. For\ngeneral cones, results are few and far between, and many basic questions remain\nunanswered.\n  In this memoir, we develop the theory of tensor products of convex cones in\nfull generality, with no restrictions on the cones or the ambient spaces. We\ngeneralize a few known results to the general case, and we prove many results\nwhich are altogether new. Our main contributions are: (i) We show that the\nprojective/injective cone has mapping properties analogous to those of the\nprojective/injective norm; (ii) We establish direct formulas for the lineality\nspace of the projective/injective cone; (iii) We prove that the\nprojective/injective tensor product of two closed proper cones is contained in\na closed proper cone; (iv) We show how to construct faces of the\nprojective/injective cone from faces of the base cones. As an application, we\nalso show that the tensor product of two symmetric convex sets preserves proper\nfaces; (v) For closed cones in finite-dimensional spaces, we show that the\nprojective cone is closed, and almost always strictly contained in the\ninjective cone, thereby confirming a conjecture of Barker for nearly all convex\ncones. As this manuscript was being written, this last result was superseded by\nsimultaneous discovery by Aubrun, Lami, Palazuelos and Pl\\'avala, who\nindependently proved Barker's conjecture in full generality.

This apparent\ndiscrepancy can be resolved if the accumulation of mass by the white dwarf (WD)\nis highly sporadic, and most observations are performed during low states. Here\nwe use a reanalysis of archival data from the Digital Access to a Sky Century\n@Harvard (DASCH) survey to argue that the most recent nova eruption in\nsymbiotic RN T CrB, in 1946, occurred during -- and was therefore triggered by\n-- a transient accretion high state. Based on similarities in the optical light\ncurve around 1946 and the time of the prior eruption, in 1866, we suggest that\nthe WD in T CrB accumulates most of the fuel needed to ignite the thermonuclear\nrunaways (TNRs) during accretion high states. A natural origin for such states\nis dwarf-nova like accretion-disk instabilities, which are expected in the\npresumably large disks in symbiotic binaries. The timing of the TNRs in\nsymbiotic RNe could thus be set by the stability properties of their accretion\ndisks. T CrB is in the midst of an accretion high state like the ones we posit\nled to the past two nova eruptions. Combined with the approach of the time at\nwhich a TNR would be expected based on the 80-year interval between the prior\ntwo novae ($2026 \\pm$3), the current accretion high state increases the\nlikelihood of a TNR occurring in T CrB in the next few years.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Sep 2020 18:50:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-14"}

The star shows coherent variability at\noptical wavelengths with an amplitude of ~0.03mag and a period of 15.26h, which\nwe interpret as the spin period of the white dwarf.

We report the following three\nfindings as important features of the microwave CRF. (1) The first preflare\nactivation comes in the form of a gradual increase of the 17 GHz flux without a\ncounterpart at 34 GHz, which indicates thermal preheating. The first sign of\nnonthermal activity occurs in the form of stepwise flux increases at both 17\nand 34 GHz about 4 min before the impulsive phase. (2) Until the impulsive\nphase, the microwave emission over the entire active region is in a single\npolarization state matching the magnetic polarity of the surrounding fields.\nDuring and after the impulsive phase, the sign of the 17 GHz polarization state\nreverses in the core region, which implies a magnetic breakout--type eruption\nin a fan-spine magnetic structure. (3) The 17 GHz flux around the time of the\neruption shows quasi-periodic variations with periods of 1--2 min. The\npre-eruption oscillation is more obvious in total intensity at one end of the\nflare loop, and the post-eruption oscillation, more obvious in the polarized\nintensity at a region near the inner spine. We interpret this transition as the\ntransfer of oscillatory power from kink mode oscillation to torsional Alfv\\'en\nwaves propagating along the spine field after the eruption.

The\nextensive thermal transport simulations, ranging from room temperature to\ncryogenic temperatures, reveal the emergence of a phonon hydrodynamic regime in\nGeTe at low temperature. The reduction of grain boundary scattering is found to\nplay a crucial role along with the divergent trend of umklapp and normal\nscattering at low temperatures in accommodating the hydrodynamic regime.\nAverage scattering rates for normal, umklapp, and other resistive processes are\ndistinguished for a wide range (4-300 K) of temperatures and used for\nidentifying various phonon transport regimes. Therefore, the variations of\nlattice thermal conductivity, phonon propagation length, and thermal\ndiffusivity with temperature, related to these transport regimes (ballistic,\nhydrodynamic, and kinetic), have been thoroughly investigated. The modewise\ndecomposition of lattice thermal conductivity and the distinction of thermal\ndiffusivity according to different scattering processes reveal rich information\non the dominant phonon modes and phonon scattering processes in GeTe at low\ntemperature. Further, the kinetic-collective model is used to elucidate the\nhydrodynamic behavior of phonon scattering through the relative study of\ncollective and kinetic contributions to the thermal transport properties. In\nthis context, the Knudsen number is estimated through the characteristic\nnonlocal length and the grain size, which further quantifies the consistent\nhydrodynamic behavior of phonon thermal transport for GeTe. Finally,\nphonon-vacancy scattering for GeTe is realized, and vacancies are found\nstrongly to influence the hydrodynamic window while incorporating the other\nresistive scattering mechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Sep 2020 21:50:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-28"}

Our simulator consists\nof five modules: Hardware models, Entanglement Management protocols, Resource\nManagement, Network Management, and Application. This framework is suitable for\nsimulation of quantum network prototypes that capture the breadth of current\nand future hardware technologies and protocols. We implement a comprehensive\nsuite of network protocols and demonstrate the use of SeQUeNCe by simulating a\nphotonic quantum network with nine routers equipped with quantum memories. The\nsimulation capabilities are illustrated in three use cases. We show the\ndependence of quantum network throughput on several key hardware parameters and\nstudy the impact of classical control message latency. We also investigate\nquantum memory usage efficiency in routers and demonstrate that redistributing\nmemory according to anticipated load increases network capacity by 69.1% and\nthroughput by 6.8%. We design SeQUeNCe to enable comparisons of alternative\nquantum network technologies, experiment planning, and validation and to aid\nwith new protocol design.

We propose Tied Block Convolution (TBC) that shares\nthe same thinner filters over equal blocks of channels and produces multiple\nresponses with a single filter. The concept of TBC can also be extended to\ngroup convolution and fully connected layers, and can be applied to various\nbackbone networks and attention modules.

In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving push-sum approach\nfor directed networks that can protect the privacy of all agents while\nachieving average consensus simultaneously. Each node decomposes its initial\nstate arbitrarily into two substates, and their average equals to the initial\nstate, guaranteeing that the agent's state will converge to the accurate\naverage consensus. Only one substate is exchanged by the node with its\nneighbours over time, and the other one is reserved. That is to say, only the\nexchanged substate would be visible to an adversary, preventing the initial\nstate information from leakage.

While research is already underway to\nformalize a machine-learning concept of fairness and to design frameworks for\nbuilding fair models with sacrifice in accuracy, most are geared toward either\nsupervised or unsupervised learning. Yet two observations inspired us to wonder\nwhether semi-supervised learning might be useful to solve discrimination\nproblems. First, previous study showed that increasing the size of the training\nset may lead to a better trade-off between fairness and accuracy. Second, the\nmost powerful models today require an enormous of data to train which, in\npractical terms, is likely possible from a combination of labeled and unlabeled\ndata. Hence, in this paper, we present a framework of fair semi-supervised\nlearning in the pre-processing phase, including pseudo labeling to predict\nlabels for unlabeled data, a re-sampling method to obtain multiple fair\ndatasets and lastly, ensemble learning to improve accuracy and decrease\ndiscrimination. A theoretical decomposition analysis of bias, variance and\nnoise highlights the different sources of discrimination and the impact they\nhave on fairness in semi-supervised learning. A set of experiments on\nreal-world and synthetic datasets show that our method is able to use unlabeled\ndata to achieve a better trade-off between accuracy and discrimination.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Sep 2020 05:48:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-28"}

However, the elementary mechanisms of momentum transport in\nsuch athermal particulate fluids are elusive. As a result, existing models for\ncohesive granular viscosity remain phenomenological and debated. Here we use\ndiscrete element simulations of plane shear flows to measure the viscosity of\ncohesive granular materials, while tuning the intensity of inter-particle\nadhesion. We establish that two adhesion-related, dimensionless numbers control\ntheir viscosity. These numbers compare the force and energy required to break a\nbond to the characteristic stress and kinetic energy in the flow. This\nprogresses the commonly accepted view that only one dimensionless number could\ncontrol the effect of adhesion. The resulting scaling law captures strong,\nnon-Newtonian variations in viscosity, unifying several existing viscosity\nmodels. We then directly link these variations in viscosity to adhesion-induced\nmodifications in the flow micro-structure and contact network. This analysis\nreveals the existence of two modes of momentum transport, involving either\ngrain micro-acceleration or balanced contact forces, and shows that adhesion\nonly affects the later. This advances our understanding of rheological models\nfor granular materials and other soft materials such as emulsions and\nsuspensions, which may also involve inter-particle adhesive forces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Sep 2020 06:34:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Oct 2020 06:56:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-08"}

This enables us to disentangle the treatment effect from the effect of\nrescue medication on a patient's outcome, while avoiding the strong\nextrapolations that are typically needed when inferring what the\nintention-to-treat effect would have been in the absence of rescue medication.\nWe develop an inverse probability weighting method to estimate this estimand\nunder specific untestable assumptions, in view of which we propose a\nsensitivity analysis.

However, they are likely to induce excessive extension to\nthe backgrounds which leads to over-estimated localization. In this paper, we\nconsider the background as an important cue that guides the feature activation\nto cover the sophisticated object region and propose contrastive attention\nloss. The loss promotes similarity between foreground and its dropped version,\nand, dissimilarity between the dropped version and background. Furthermore, we\npropose foreground consistency loss that penalizes earlier layers producing\nnoisy attention regarding the later layer as a reference to provide them with a\nsense of backgroundness.

Thus reducing\ncommunication is vital, both, from an economical and an ecological perspective.\nFor machine learning, on-device learning avoids sending raw data, which can\nreduce communication substantially. Furthermore, not centralizing the data\nprotects privacy-sensitive data. However, most learning algorithms require\nhardware with high computation power and thus high energy consumption. In\ncontrast, ultra-low-power processors, like FPGAs or micro-controllers, allow\nfor energy-efficient learning of local models. Combined with\ncommunication-efficient distributed learning strategies, this reduces the\noverall energy consumption and enables applications that were yet impossible\ndue to limited energy on local devices. The major challenge is then, that the\nlow-power processors typically only have integer processing capabilities. This\npaper investigates an approach to communication-efficient on-device learning of\ninteger exponential families that can be executed on low-power processors, is\nprivacy-preserving, and effectively minimizes communication. The empirical\nevaluation shows that the approach can reach a model quality comparable to a\ncentrally learned regular model with an order of magnitude less communication.\nComparing the overall energy consumption, this reduces the required energy for\nsolving the machine learning task by a significant amount.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Sep 2020 09:29:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-28"}

An assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of\ncurrent methods is a crucial step in the eventual development of an approach to\nmeet this challenge. We report on the performance of 13 photometric redshift\ncode single value redshift estimates and redshift probability distributions\n(PDZs) on a common set of data, focusing particularly on the 0.2--2.6 redshift\nrange that the Euclid mission will probe. We design a challenge using emulated\nEuclid data drawn from three photometric surveys of the COSMOS field. The data\nare divided into two samples: one calibration sample for which photometry and\nredshifts are provided to the participants; and the validation sample,\ncontaining only the photometry, to ensure a blinded test of the methods.\nParticipants were invited to provide a redshift single value estimate and a PDZ\nfor each source in the validation sample, along with a rejection flag that\nindicates sources they consider unfit for use in cosmological analyses. The\nperformance of each method is assessed through a set of informative metrics,\nusing cross-matched spectroscopic and highly-accurate photometric redshifts as\nthe ground truth. We show that the rejection criteria set by participants are\nefficient in removing strong outliers, sources for which the photo-z deviates\nby more than 0.15(1+z) from the spectroscopic-redshift (spec-z).

This translates into a more efficient use of resources, reduced\nproduction time, output of higher quality and reduced waste. Given the\ncomplexity of today's industrial processes, it becomes infeasible to monitor\nand optimize them without the use of information technologies and analytics. In\nrecent years, machine learning methods have been used to automate processes and\nprovide decision support. All of this, based on analyzing large amounts of data\ngenerated in a continuous manner. In this paper, we present the results of\napplying machine learning methods during a chemical sulphonation process with\nthe objective of automating the product quality analysis which currently is\nperformed manually. We used data from process parameters to train different\nmodels including Random Forest, Neural Network and linear regression in order\nto predict product quality values. Our experiments showed that it is possible\nto predict those product quality values with good accuracy, thus, having the\npotential to reduce time. Specifically, the best results were obtained with\nRandom Forest with a mean absolute error of 0.089 and a correlation of 0.978.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Sep 2020 10:56:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-28"}

Among the techniques available in the\nliterature, multi-modal hashing, which can encode heterogeneous multi-modal\nfeatures into compact hash codes, has received particular attention. Most of\nthe existing multi-modal hashing methods adopt the fixed weighting factors to\nfuse multiple modalities for any query data, which cannot capture the variation\nof different queries.

In\npractice, every quantum system interacts with the environment leading to an\nirreversible loss of coherence. The Spin-Boson model (SBM) is central to the\nunderstanding of the fundamental process of decoherence of a two-state quantum\nsystem interacting with a bosonic heat bath but the nature of transient\ndynamics in the presence of hybrid diagonal and off-diagonal system-bath\ninteractions remains largely unexplored.

This paper further broadens this family by introducing\npass-and-swap (P&S) queues, an extension of OI queues where, upon a service\ncompletion, the customer that completes service is not necessarily the one that\nleaves the system. More precisely, we supplement the OI queue model with an\nundirected graph on the customer classes, which we call a swapping graph, such\nthat there is an edge between two classes if customers of these classes can be\nswapped with one another. When a customer completes service, it passes over\ncustomers in the remainder of the queue until it finds a customer it can swap\npositions with, that is, a customer whose class is a neighbor in the graph. In\nits turn, the customer that is ejected from its position takes the position of\nthe next customer it can be swapped with, and so on. This is repeated until a\ncustomer can no longer find another customer to be swapped with; this customer\nis the one that leaves the queue. After proving that P&S queues have a\nproduct-form stationary distribution, we derive a necessary and sufficient\nstability condition for (open networks of) P&S queues that also applies to OI\nqueues. We then study irreducibility properties of closed networks of P&S\nqueues and derive the corresponding product-form stationary distribution.\nLastly, we demonstrate that closed networks of P&S queues can be applied to\ndescribe the dynamics of new and existing load-distribution and scheduling\nprotocols in clusters of machines in which jobs have assignment constraints.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Sep 2020 15:42:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2020 18:24:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 1 Mar 2021 18:56:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-13"}

To\nalleviate these problems, in this paper, we propose a novel multi-view\nco-teaching network from sparse interaction data for job-resume matching.

The core idea is to let the two components\nhelp each other by selecting more reliable training instances. The two\nstrategies focus on representation enhancement and data enhancement,\nrespectively.

Zika virus is primarily transmitted through bites\nof infected mosquitoes of the species Aedes (Aedes aegypti and Aedes\nalbopictus).

Berni's work with Tom\nWainwright, described in the 1959 Scientific American[1], brought Bill to\ninterview at Livermore in 1962. Hired by Berni, Bill enjoyed over 40 years'\nresearch at the Laboratory. Berni, along with Edward Teller, founded UC's\nDepartment of Applied Science in 1963. Their motivation was to attract bright\nstudents to use the laboratory's unparalleled research facilities. In 1972\nCarol was offered a joint LLNL employee-DAS student appointment at Livermore.\nBill, thanks to Berni's efforts, was already a Professor at DAS. Carol became\none of Bill's best students. Berni's influence was directly responsible for our\nphysics collaboration and our marriage in 1989. The present work is devoted to\ntwo early interests of Berni's, irreversibility and shockwaves. Berni and Tom\nstudied the irreversibility of Boltzmann's \"H function\" in the early 1950s[2].\nBerni called shockwaves the \"most irreversible\" of hydrodynamic processes[3].\nJust this past summer, in simulating shockwaves with time-reversible classical\nmechanics, we found that reversed Runge-Kutta shockwave simulations yielded\nnonsteady rarefaction waves, not shocks. Intrigued by this unexpected result we\nstudied the exponential Lyapunov instabilities in both wave types. Besides the\nRunge-Kutta and Leapfrog algorithms, we developed a precisely-reversible\nmanybody algorithm based on trajectory storing, just changing the velocities'\nsigns to generate the reversed trajectories. Both shocks and rarefactions were\nprecisely reversed.
