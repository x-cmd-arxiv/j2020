While decentralized blockchain-based crowdsourcing provides\nnumerous benefits compared to centralized solutions, current implementations of\ndecentralized crowdsourcing suffer from fundamental scalability limitations by\nrequiring all participants to pay a small transaction fee every time they\ninteract with the blockchain. This increases the cost of using decentralized\ncrowdsourcing solutions, resulting in a total payment that could be even higher\nthan the price charged by centralized crowdsourcing platforms. This paper\nproposes a novel suite of protocols called NF-Crowd that resolves the\nscalability issue by reducing the lower bound of the total cost of a\ndecentralized crowdsourcing project to O(1). NF-Crowd is a highly reliable\nsolution for scaling decentralized crowdsourcing.

A comparison is performed on the original dataset as well as\nthe over-sampled data set. The oversampling technique used is Cluster-based\nOver-Sampling with Noise Filtering. This technique is better than several\nstate-of-the-art techniques for oversampling. The analysis is carried out on 3\nprojects KC1, PC4 and PC3 carried out by the NASA group. The metrics used for\nmeasurement are recall and balanced accuracy. The results are higher for OS-ELM\nas compared to other classifiers in both scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Sep 2020 17:26:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-06"}

However, due to the annotation cost, datasets in\nmedical imaging are often either partially-labeled or small. For example,\nDeepLesion is such a large-scale CT image dataset with lesions of various\ntypes, but it also has many unlabeled lesions (missing annotations). When\ntraining a lesion detector on a partially-labeled dataset, the missing\nannotations will generate incorrect negative signals and degrade the\nperformance. Besides DeepLesion, there are several small single-type datasets,\nsuch as LUNA for lung nodules and LiTS for liver tumors.

In this work, we aim to develop a\nuniversal lesion detection algorithm to detect a variety of lesions. The\nproblem of heterogeneous and partial labels is tackled. First, we build a\nsimple yet effective lesion detection framework named Lesion ENSemble (LENS).\nLENS can efficiently learn from multiple heterogeneous lesion datasets in a\nmulti-task fashion and leverage their synergy by proposal fusion.

In this paper, I\nwant to go further into the consequences of this way of considering the\nmeasurement, that I have called Convivial Solipsism, and show that even if, in\nthe usual sense, there is no physical effect of the present or of the future on\nthe past, we must nevertheless consider that the observer's past is sometimes\nnot entirely determined and that it becomes determined only when certain\nmeasurements are done latter. This apparent contradiction disappears if one\nunderstand that each observer builds, through her own measurements, her own\nworld (that I call the phenomenal world in Convivial Solipsism) which is\ndifferent from what we are used to consider as the common world shared by\neverybody.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Sep 2020 19:39:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Mar 2021 17:01:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-19"}

In this\npaper we focus on some key decidability issues related to smart sensor attacks.\nWe first present a sufficient and necessary condition that ensures the\nexistence of a smart sensor attack, which reveals a novel demand-supply\nrelationship between an attacker and a controlled plant, represented as a set\nof risky pairs. Each risky pair consists of a damage string desired by the\nattacker and an observable sequence feasible in the supervisor such that the\nlatter induces a sequence of control patterns, which allows the damage string\nto happen. It turns out that each risky pair can induce a smart weak sensor\nattack. Next, we show that, when the plant, supervisor and damage language are\nregular, it is computationally feasible to remove all such risky pairs from the\nplant behaviour, via a genuine encoding scheme, upon which we are able to\nestablish our key result that the existence of a nonblocking supervisor\nresilient to smart sensor attacks is decidable.

To rapidly estimate the mmWave automotive radar channel in the\nDoppler-angle domain with a wide field-of-view, our JCR design employs a few\ncirculant shifts of the transmit beamformer and apply two-dimensional partial\nFourier compressed sensing technique.

We evaluate the JCR\nperformance trade-offs using a normalized mean square error (MSE) metric for\nradar estimation and a distortion MSE metric for data communication, which is\nanalogous to the distortion metric in the rate distortion theory.

Although mean-field theory predicts a\nuniversal value of this exponent, $\\tau_{\\rm MF}=1.5$, numerical simulations\nhave reported different values depending on the literature. Moreover, in the\nelastic regime, it has been noted that the critical exponent can be different\nfrom that in the steady state, and even criticality itself is a matter of\ndebate. Because these confusingly varying results were reported under different\nsetups, our knowledge of avalanche criticality in sheared glasses is greatly\nlimited. To gain a unified understanding, in this work, we conduct a\ncomprehensive numerical investigation of avalanches in Lennard-Jones glasses\nunder athermal quasistatic shear. In particular, by excluding the ambiguity and\narbitrariness that has crept into the conventional measurement schemes, we\nachieve high-precision measurement and demonstrate that the exponent $\\tau$ in\nthe steady state follows the mean-field prediction of $\\tau_{\\rm MF}=1.5$. Our\nresults also suggest that there are two qualitatively different avalanche\nevents. This binariness leads to the non-universal behavior of the avalanche\nsize distribution and is likely to be the cause of the varying values of $\\tau$\nreported thus far. To investigate the dependence of criticality and\nuniversality on applied shear, we further study the statistics of avalanches in\nthe elastic regime and the ensemble of the first avalanche event in different\nsamples, which provide information about the unperturbed system. We show that\nwhile the unperturbed system is indeed off-critical, criticality gradually\ndevelops as shear is applied.

First, we present a platform architecture of blockchain-based federated\nlearning systems for failure detection in IIoT, which enables verifiable\nintegrity of client data. In the architecture, each client periodically creates\na Merkle tree in which each leaf node represents a client data record, and\nstores the tree root on a blockchain. Further, to address the data\nheterogeneity issue in IIoT failure detection, we propose a novel centroid\ndistance weighted federated averaging (CDW\\_FedAvg) algorithm taking into\naccount the distance between positive class and negative class of each client\ndataset. In addition, to motivate clients to participate in federated learning,\na smart contact based incentive mechanism is designed depending on the size and\nthe centroid distance of client data used in local model training. A prototype\nof the proposed architecture is implemented with our industry partner, and\nevaluated in terms of feasibility, accuracy and performance. The results show\nthat the approach is feasible, and has satisfactory accuracy and performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Sep 2020 04:03:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 18 Oct 2020 11:26:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-20"}

While a\nlarge number of research papers highlight the prosperity of science and\ntechnology, they also give rise to some problems. As we all know, academic\npapers are the most intuitive embodiment of the research results of scholars,\nwhich can reflect the level of researchers. It is also the evaluation standard\nfor decision-making such as promotion and allocation of funds. Therefore, how\nto measure the quality of an academic paper is very important. The most common\nstandard for measuring academic papers is the number of citation counts of\npapers, because this indicator is widely used in the evaluation of scientific\npublications, and it also serves as the basis for many other indicators (such\nas the h-index). Therefore, it is very important to be able to accurately\npredict the citation counts of academic papers.\n  This paper proposes an end-to-end deep learning network, DeepCCP, which\ncombines the effect of information cascade and looks at the citation counts\nprediction problem from the perspective of information cascade prediction.\nDeepCCP directly uses the citation network formed in the early stage of the\npaper as the input, and the output is the citation counts of the corresponding\npaper after a period of time. DeepCCP only uses the structure and temporal\ninformation of the citation network, and does not require other additional\ninformation, but it can still achieve outstanding performance.

While in the classical KF, the\nuncertainty associated with the previous estimate is inflated by adding the\nprocess noise covariance, in the present case, the uncertainty inflation is\ndone by multiplying the previous covariance matrix by an exponential factor.\nThis difference allows us to solve a larger variety of problems using\nessentially the same algorithm. We thus propose a unified and optimal, in the\nleast-squares sense, method for filtering, prediction, smoothing and general\nout-of-sequence updates. All of these tasks require different Kalman-like\nalgorithms when addressed in the classical manner.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Sep 2020 07:03:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-08"}

This method allows for the optimal tradeoff between the preferred feed\ndirection field and the constant scallop height, and yields a minimized overall\npath length. The optimality is achieved by formulating tool path planning as a\nPoisson problem that minimizes a simple, quadratic energy. This Poisson\nformulation considers all tool paths at once, without resorting to any\nheuristic sampling or initial tool path choosing as in existing methods, and is\nthus a globally optimal solution. Finding the optimal tool paths amounts to\nsolving a well-conditioned sparse linear system, which is computationally\nconvenient and efficient. Tool paths are represented with an implicit scheme\nthat can completely avoid the challenging topological issues of path\nsingularities and self-intersections seen in previous methods. The presented\nmethod has been validated with a series of examples and comparisons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Sep 2020 07:31:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-08"}

A contract defect is an error, flaw\nor fault in a smart contract that causes it to produce an incorrect or\nunexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways. Detecting and removing\ncontract defects can avoid potential bugs and make programs more robust. Our\nprevious work defined 20 contract defects for smart contracts and divided them\ninto five impact levels.

DefectChecker can detect contract defects from smart contracts\nbytecode. We compare DefectChecker with key previous works, including Oyente,\nMythril and Securify by using an open-source dataset. Our experimental results\nshow that DefectChecker performs much better than these tools in terms of both\nspeed and accuracy.

The primitive is\nenvisioned to be useful whenever a memory-bounded computing device is required\nto encrypt some data with the aim of temporarily depositing it on an untrusted\nstorage device. While the new primitive protects the confidentiality of\npayloads as much as classic authenticated encryption primitives would do, it\nprovides considerably better authenticity guarantees: Specifically, while\nclassic solutions would completely fail in a context involving user\ncorruptions, if an encrypt-to-self scheme is used to protect the data, all\nciphertexts and messages fully remain unforgeable.\n  To instantiate their encrypt-to-self primitive, Pijnenburg et al propose a\nmode of operation of the compression function of a hash function, with a\ncarefully designed encoding function playing the central role in the\nserialization of the processed message and associated data. In the present work\nwe revisit the design of this encoding function. Without questioning its\nadequacy for securely accomplishing the encrypt-to-self job, we improve on it\nfrom a technical/implementational perspective by proposing modifications that\nalleviate certain conditions that would inevitably require implementations to\ndisrespect memory alignment restrictions imposed by the word-wise operation of\nmodern CPUs, ultimately leading to performance penalties. Our main\ncontributions are thus to propose an improved encoding function, to explain why\nit offers better performance, and to prove that it provides as much security as\nits predecessor.

Recently, antiferromagnetic orders are focused on as the magnetic\norder, where current-induced spin-transfer torques, a typical effect of\nelectron transport on the magnetic order, have been debatable mainly because of\nthe lack of an analytic derivation based on quantum field theory. Here, we\nconstruct the microscopic theory of spin-transfer torques on the slowly-varying\nstaggered magnetization in antiferromagnets with weak canting. In our theory,\nthe electron is captured by bonding/antibonding states, each of which is the\neigenstate of the system, doubly degenerates, and spatially spreads to\nsublattices because of electron hopping. The spin of the eigenstates depends on\nthe momentum in general, and a nontrivial spin-momentum locking arises for the\ncase with no site inversion symmetry, without considering any spin-orbit\ncouplings. The spin current of the eigenstates includes an anomalous component\nproportional to a kind of gauge field defined by derivatives in momentum space\nand induces the adiabatic spin-transfer torques on the magnetization.\nUnexpectedly, we find that one of the nonadiabatic torques has the same form as\nthe adiabatic spin-transfer torque, while the obtained forms for the adiabatic\nand nonadiabatic spin-transfer torques agree with the phenomenological\nderivation based on the symmetry consideration. This finding suggests that the\nconventional explanation for the spin-transfer torques in antiferromagnets\nshould be changed.

Fast numerical recovery methods have been\nproposed based on reduced models which are linear spaces of moderate dimension\n$n$ which are tailored to approximate the solution manifold $\\mathcal{M}$ where\nthe solution sits. These methods can be viewed as deterministic counterparts to\nBayesian estimation approaches, and are proved to be optimal when the prior is\nexpressed by approximability of the solution with respect to the reduced model.\nHowever, they are inherently limited by their linear nature, which bounds from\nbelow their best possible performance by the Kolmogorov width\n$d_m(\\mathcal{M})$ of the solution manifold. In this paper we propose to break\nthis barrier by using simple nonlinear reduced models that consist of a finite\nunion of linear spaces $V_k$, each having dimension at most $m$ and leading to\ndifferent estimators $u_k^*$. A model selection mechanism based on minimizing\nthe PDE residual over the parameter space is used to select from this\ncollection the final estimator $u^*$.

This result is particularly\nuseful in cases where numerical difficulties related to the convergence of the\nsolution-seeking algorithm hinder the exact quantification of the optimal\nsolution. Furthermore, it can be applied to cases where the agents' incentives\nlead to a suboptimal solution, e.g., under a non-cooperative setting. We then\nfocus on optimization programs where the cost function admits an aggregate\nrepresentation and depends on uncertainty while constraints are deterministic.\nBy exploiting the structure of the program under study and leveraging the so\ncalled support rank notion, we provide agent-independent robustness\ncertificates for the optimal solution, i.e., the constructed bound on the\nprobability of constraint violation does not depend on the number of agents,\nbut only on the dimension of the agents' decision.

This limits the amount\nof data available from individual experiments and hinders the development of\nanalysis techniques and models for more realistic sizes of neuronal\npopulations. The ability to artificially synthesize realistic neuronal calcium\nsignals could greatly alleviate this problem by scaling up the number of\ntrials. Here, we propose a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model to\ngenerate realistic calcium signals as seen in neuronal somata with calcium\nimaging.

To mitigate the difficulties of using\nseq2seq models to align long sequences, we down-sample the input spectral\nfeature along the temporal dimension and equip the synthesis model with a\ndiscretized mixture of logistic (MoL) attention mechanism.

One possible example of such a target is a protein switching between\ndifferent conformational states.

The multi-frequency observational properties\nand current theories are reviewed with emphasis on developments since the\nearlier review of O'Dea (1998). There are three main hypotheses for the nature\nof PS and CSS sources. (1) The PS sources might be very young radio galaxies\nwhich will evolve into CSS sources on their way to becoming large radio\ngalaxies. (2) The PS and CSS sources might be compact because they are confined\n(and enhanced in radio power) by interaction with dense gas in their\nenvironments. (3) Alternately, the PS sources might be transient or\nintermittent sources. Each of these hypotheses may apply to individual objects.\nThe relative number in each population will have significant implications for\nthe radio galaxy paradigm. Proper motion studies over long time baselines have\nhelped determine hotspot speeds for over three dozen sources and establish that\nthese are young objects. Multifrequency polarization observations have\ndemonstrated that many CSS/PS sources are embedded in a dense interstellar\nmedium and vigorously interacting with it. The detection of emission line gas\naligned with the radio source, and blue-shifted HI absorption and [OIII]\nemission lines indicates that AGN feedback is present in these objects --\npossibly driven by the radio source.

Some of them may result in poor product\nquality and/or time and budget overruns due to incorrect or missing quality\ncharacteristics, such as security. This characteristic requires special\nattention in web applications because they have become a target for\nmanipulating sensible data. Several concerns make security difficult to deal\nwith. For instance, security requirements are often misunderstood and\nimproperly specified due to lack of security expertise and emphasis on security\nduring early stages of software development. This often leads to unspecified or\nill-defined security-related aspects. These concerns become even more\nchallenging in agile contexts, where lightweight documentation is typically\nproduced. To tackle this problem, we designed an approach for reviewing\nsecurity-related aspects in agile requirements specifications of web\napplications. Our proposal considers user stories and security specifications\nas inputs and relates those user stories to security properties via Natural\nLanguage Processing. Based on the related security properties, our approach\nidentifies high-level security requirements from the Open Web Application\nSecurity Project (OWASP) to be verified, and generates a reading technique to\nsupport reviewers in detecting defects. We evaluate our approach via three\nexperiment trials conducted with 56 novice software engineers, measuring\neffectiveness, efficiency, usefulness, and ease of use. We compare our approach\nagainst using: (1) the OWASP high-level security requirements, and (2) a\nperspective-based approach as proposed in contemporary state of the art.

Bredges are vulnerable links\nthat play an important role in network collapse processes, which may result\nfrom node or link failures, attacks or epidemics. Therefore, the abundance and\nproperties of bredges affect the resilience of the network. We present\nanalytical results for the statistical properties of bredges in configuration\nmodel networks. Using a generating function approach based on the cavity\nmethod, we calculate the probability $\\hat P(e\\in{\\rm B})$ that a random edge e\nin a configuration model network with degree distribution P(k) is a bredge (B).\nWe also calculate the joint degree distribution $\\hat P(k,k'|{\\rm B})$ of the\nend-nodes of a random bredge. We examine the distinct properties of bredges on\nthe giant component (GC) and on the finite tree components (FC) of the network.\nOn the finite components all the edges are bredges and there are no\ndegree-degree correlations. We calculate the probability $\\hat P(e\\in{\\rm\nB}|{\\rm GC})$ that a random edge on the giant component is a bredge. We also\ncalculate the joint degree distribution $\\hat P(k,k'|{\\rm B},{\\rm GC})$ of the\nend-nodes of bredges and the joint degree distribution $\\hat P(k,k'|{\\rm\nNB},{\\rm GC})$ of the end-nodes of non-bredge (NB) edges on the giant\ncomponent. Surprisingly, it is found that the degrees k and k' of the end-nodes\nof bredges are correlated, while the degrees of the end-nodes of NB edges are\nuncorrelated. We thus conclude that all the degree-degree correlations on the\ngiant component are concentrated on the bredges. We calculate the covariance of\nend-nodes of bredges and show it is negative, namely bredges tend to connect\nhigh degree nodes to low degree nodes. The implications of the results are\ndiscussed in the context of common attack scenarios and dismantling processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Sep 2020 13:34:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-09"}

The interest of\nthis paper is the Igbo language, which uses compounding as a common type of\nword formation and as well has many vocabularies of compound words. The issues\nof collocation, word ordering and compounding play high role in Igbo language.\nThe ambiguity in dealing with these compound words has made the representation\nof Igbo language text document very difficult because this cannot be addressed\nusing the most common and standard approach of the Bag-Of-Words (BOW) model of\ntext representation, which ignores the word order and relation. However, this\ncause for a concern and the need to develop an improved model to capture this\nsituation. This paper presents the analysis of Igbo language text document,\nconsidering its compounding nature and describes its representation with the\nWord-based N-gram model to properly prepare it for any text-based application.\nThe result shows that Bigram and Trigram n-gram text representation models\nprovide more semantic information as well addresses the issues of compounding,\nword ordering and collocations which are the major language peculiarities in\nIgbo. They are likely to give better performance when used in any Igbo\ntext-based system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Sep 2020 19:07:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-15"}

Although syntax trees are\nprecisely defined according to the language grammar and easier to construct and\nprocess than graphs, previous tree-based learning techniques have not been able\nto learn semantic information from trees to achieve better accuracy than\ngraph-based techniques. We propose a new learning technique, named TreeCaps, by\nfusing together capsule networks with tree-based convolutional neural networks,\nto achieve learning accuracy higher than existing graph-based techniques while\nit is based only on trees. TreeCaps introduces novel variable-to-static routing\nalgorithms into the capsule networks to compensate for the loss of previous\nrouting algorithms. Aside from accuracy, we also find that TreeCaps is the most\nrobust to withstand those semantic-preserving program transformations that\nchange code syntax without modifying the semantics.

In this approach, the origin\nof the finite minimum value of uncertainty is attributed to the\nnon-differentiable (virtual) trajectory of a quantum particle and then both of\nthe Kennard and Robertson-Schr\\\"{o}dinger inequalities in quantum mechanics are\nreproduced.
