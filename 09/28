The Andreev $\\pi$-phase has nothing to do with the\nspecific form of the odd-parity pairings and means an intrinsic $\\pi$-phase\nbetween the spin-triplet Cooper pairs entering and leaving CTSCs in the Andreev\nreflections. The orbital-phase corresponds to the phase difference between the\nspin-triplet Cooper pairs with opposite spin polarization and depends on the\nspecific form of the odd-parity gap functions. When the normal region of the\nJosephson junction contacts the same side of the CTSCs with some specific\nodd-parity parings, the competition between the two phases can lead to the\nJosephson $\\pi$-junction.

The recent literature of information design --\na.k.a. signaling or persuasion -- looks to improve equilibria by providing\ncarefully-tuned information to players in order to influence their actions.\nMost previous studies have focused on the question of designing optimal\nsignaling schemes. This work departs from previous research by considering a\ndescriptive question and looks to quantitatively characterize the power of\nsignaling (PoS), i.e., how much a signaling designer can improve her objective\nof the equilibrium outcome. We consider four signaling schemes with increasing\npower: full information, optimal public signaling, optimal private signaling\nand optimal ex-ante private signaling. Our main result is a clean and tight\ncharacterization of the additional power each signaling scheme has over its\nimmediate predecessor above in the broad classes of cost-minimization and\npayoff-maximization games where: (1) all players minimize non-negative cost\nfunctions or maximize non-negative payoff functions; (2) the signaling designer\n(naturally) optimizes the sum of players' utilities. We prove that the\nadditional power of signaling -- defined as the worst-case ratio between the\nequilibrium objectives of two consecutive signaling schemes in the above list\n-- is bounded precisely by the well-studied notion of the price of anarchy of\nthe corresponding games. Moreover, we show that all these bounds are tight.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Sep 2020 17:27:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-29"}

When involving personalized information, how\nto protect the privacy of such information becomes a critical issue in\npractice. In this paper, we consider a dynamic pricing problem over $T$ time\nperiods with an \\emph{unknown} demand function of posted price and personalized\ninformation. At each time $t$, the retailer observes an arriving customer's\npersonal information and offers a price. The customer then makes the purchase\ndecision, which will be utilized by the retailer to learn the underlying demand\nfunction. There is potentially a serious privacy concern during this process: a\nthird party agent might infer the personalized information and purchase\ndecisions from price changes from the pricing system. Using the fundamental\nframework of differential privacy from computer science, we develop a\nprivacy-preserving dynamic pricing policy, which tries to maximize the retailer\nrevenue while avoiding information leakage of individual customer's information\nand purchasing decisions. To this end, we first introduce a notion of\n\\emph{anticipating} $(\\varepsilon, \\delta)$-differential privacy that is\ntailored to dynamic pricing problem.

Linear stability analysis of\nthe resulting equations shows that some features of the instability, such as\nemerging wavelengths, may not be influenced by the imposed substrate anchoring.\nGoing further into the nonlinear regime, considered via large-scale GPU-based\nsimulations, shows however that nonlinear effects may play an important role,\nin particular in the case of strong substrate anchoring anisotropy.

Learning from extreme bandit feedback is\nubiquitous in recommendation systems, in which billions of decisions are made\nover sets consisting of millions of choices in a single day, yielding massive\nobservational data. In these large-scale real-world applications, supervised\nlearning frameworks such as eXtreme Multi-label Classification (XMC) are widely\nused despite the fact that they incur significant biases due to the mismatch\nbetween bandit feedback and supervised labels. Such biases can be mitigated by\nimportance sampling techniques, but these techniques suffer from impractical\nvariance when dealing with a large number of actions. In this paper, we\nintroduce a selective importance sampling estimator (sIS) that operates in a\nsignificantly more favorable bias-variance regime. The sIS estimator is\nobtained by performing importance sampling on the conditional expectation of\nthe reward with respect to a small subset of actions for each instance (a form\nof Rao-Blackwellization). We employ this estimator in a novel algorithmic\nprocedure -- named Policy Optimization for eXtreme Models (POXM) -- for\nlearning from bandit feedback on XMC tasks. In POXM, the selected actions for\nthe sIS estimator are the top-p actions of the logging policy, where p is\nadjusted from the data and is significantly smaller than the size of the action\nspace. We use a supervised-to-bandit conversion on three XMC datasets to\nbenchmark our POXM method against three competing methods: BanditNet, a\npreviously applied partial matching pruning strategy, and a supervised learning\nbaseline.

Therefore,\nlong-tailed classification is the key to deep learning at scale. However,\nexisting methods are mainly based on re-weighting/re-sampling heuristics that\nlack a fundamental theory. In this paper, we establish a causal inference\nframework, which not only unravels the whys of previous methods, but also\nderives a new principled solution. Specifically, our theory shows that the SGD\nmomentum is essentially a confounder in long-tailed classification. On one\nhand, it has a harmful causal effect that misleads the tail prediction biased\ntowards the head. On the other hand, its induced mediation also benefits the\nrepresentation learning and head prediction.

Their aim was to explain the gaps between real-world\nnetworks that function well despite being dynamic, and the strong theoretical\nlower bounds for arbitrary networks. To this end, they introduced a basic model\nof smoothing in dynamic networks, where an adversary picks a sequence of\ngraphs, representing the topology of the network over time, and then each of\nthese graphs is slightly perturbed in a random manner. The model suggested\nabove is based on a per-round noise, and our aim in this work is to extend it\nto models of noise more suited for multiple rounds. This is motivated by\nlong-lived networks, where the amount and location of noise may vary over time.\nTo this end, we present several different models of noise. First, we extend the\nprevious model to cases where the amount of noise is very small.

The similarity is\nconducted in a higher-dimensional space to disentangle the difference of their\ndistributions using a kernel based method. Finally, the desired ANN is learned\nbased on the information from both the ground-truth and teacher, progressively.\nThe effectiveness of the proposed method for learning ANN with higher\nperformance is then well-verified on several benchmarks. For instance, the\nANN-50 trained using the proposed PKKD method obtains a 76.8\\% top-1 accuracy\non ImageNet dataset, which is 0.6\\% higher than that of the ResNet-50.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Sep 2020 03:29:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Sep 2020 07:11:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 15 Oct 2020 03:39:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-16"}

The linearization-based extended Kalman filter (EKF) is\nwidely applied to nonlinear industrial systems. As EKF is limited in accuracy\nand reliability, sequential Monte-Carlo methods or particle filters (PF) can\nobtain superior accuracy at the cost of a huge number of random samples. The\nunscented Kalman filter (UKF) can achieve adequate accuracy more efficiently by\nusing deterministic samples, but its weights may be negative, which might cause\ninstability problem. For Gaussian filters, the cubature Kalman filter (CKF) and\nGauss Hermit filter (GHF) employ cubature and respectively Gauss-Hermite rules\nto approximate statistic information of random variables and exhibit impressive\nperformances in practical problems. Inspired by this work, this paper presents\na new nonlinear estimation scheme named after geometric unscented Kalman filter\n(GUF). The GUF chooses the filtering framework of CKF for updating data and\ndevelops a geometric unscented sampling (GUS) strategy for approximating random\nvariables. The main feature of GUS is selecting uniformly distributed samples\naccording to the probability and geometric location similar to UKF and CKF, and\nhaving positive weights like PF.

I investigate the incidence and consequences of teacher turnover in\nRwandan public primary schools over the period from 2016-2019. To do so, I\ncombine the universe of teacher placement records with student enrollment\nfigures and school-average Primary Leaving Exam scores in a nationally\nrepresentative sample of 259 schools. Results highlight five features of\nteacher turnover. First, rates of teacher turnover are high: annually, 20\npercent of teachers separate from their jobs, of which 11 percent exit from the\npublic-sector teaching workforce. Second, the burden of teacher churn is higher\nin schools with low learning levels and, perhaps surprisingly, in low\npupil-teacher-ratio schools. Third, teacher turnover is concentrated among\nearly-career teachers, male teachers, and those assigned to teach Math. Fourth,\nreplacing teachers quickly after they exit is a challenge; 23 percent of\nexiting teachers are not replaced the following year. And fifth, teacher\nturnover is associated with subsequent declines in learning outcomes.

Furthermore, a cross-entropy loss backpropagation\nscheme computed with integer-only arithmetic is proposed. A proof-of-concept\nopen-source software implementation of NITI that utilizes native 8-bit integer\noperations in modern GPUs to achieve end-to-end training is presented. When\ncompared with an equivalent training setup implemented with floating point\nstorage and arithmetic, NITI achieves negligible accuracy degradation on the\nMNIST and CIFAR10 datasets using 8-bit integer storage and computation. On\nImageNet, 16-bit integers are needed for weight accumulation with an 8-bit\ndatapath. This achieves training results comparable to all-floating-point\nimplementations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Sep 2020 07:41:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Feb 2022 11:08:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-14"}

Most idealizations of\nclosed reaction-diffusion systems employ no-flux boundary conditions, and often\npatterns will form up to, or along, these boundaries. Motivated by boundaries\nof patterning fields related to the emergence of spatial form in embryonic\ndevelopment, we propose a set of mixed boundary conditions for a two-species\nreaction-diffusion system which forms inhomogeneous solutions away from the\nboundary of the domain for a variety of different reaction kinetics, with a\nprescribed uniform state near the boundary.

This\nphenomenon is manifested in thermoacoustic systems. This thermoacoustic\ninstability may lead to the disintegration of rocket engines, gas turbines and\naeroengines, so it is necessary to design control measures for its suppression.\nIt was speculated that such unwanted instability states may be dodged by\nchanging quickly enough the bifurcation parameters. Thus, in this work, based\non a fundamental mathematical model of thermoacoustic systems driven by colored\nnoise, the corresponding Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation of the amplitude is\nderived by using a stochastic averaging method. A transient dynamical behavior\nis identified through a probability density analysis. We find that the rate of\nchange of parameters and the correlation time of the noise are helpful to dodge\nthermoacoustic instability, while a relatively large noise intensity is a\ndisadvantageous factor. In addition, power-law relationships between the\nmaximum amplitude and the noise parameters are explored, and the probability of\nsuccessfully dodging a thermoacoustic instability is calculated.

Inspired by dynamical system theory, we design a stabilized neural\nODE network named SONet whose ODE blocks are skew-symmetric and proved to be\ninput-output stable. With natural training, SONet can achieve comparable\nrobustness with the state-of-the-art adversarial defense methods, without\nsacrificing natural accuracy. Even replacing only the first layer of a ResNet\nby such a ODE block can exhibit further improvement in robustness, e.g., under\nPGD-20 ($\\ell_\\infty=0.031$) attack on CIFAR-10 dataset, it achieves 91.57\\%\nand natural accuracy and 62.35\\% robust accuracy, while a counterpart\narchitecture of ResNet trained with TRADES achieves natural and robust accuracy\n76.29\\% and 45.24\\%, respectively.

In\nthis paper, we propose a scaling technique and a moving technique to adaptively\ncluster enough collocation points in a region of interest in order to achieve a\nfast spectral convergence. Our scaling algorithm employs an indicator in the\nfrequency domain that is used to determine when scaling is needed and informs\nthe tuning of a scaling factor to redistribute collocation points to adapt to\nthe diffusive behavior of the solution.

Indeed, predicting\nthe longitudinal (i.e., time-dependent ) brain dysconnectivity as it emerges\nand evolves over time from a single timepoint can help design personalized\ntreatments for disordered patients in a very early stage. Despite its\nsignificance, evolution models of the brain graph are largely overlooked in the\nliterature. Here, we propose EvoGraphNet, the first end-to-end geometric deep\nlearning-powered graph-generative adversarial network (gGAN) for predicting\ntime-dependent brain graph evolution from a single timepoint. Our EvoGraphNet\narchitecture cascades a set of time-dependent gGANs, where each gGAN\ncommunicates its predicted brain graphs at a particular timepoint to train the\nnext gGAN in the cascade at follow-up timepoint. Therefore, we obtain each next\npredicted timepoint by setting the output of each generator as the input of its\nsuccessor which enables us to predict a given number of timepoints using only\none single timepoint in an end- to-end fashion. At each timepoint, to better\nalign the distribution of the predicted brain graphs with that of the\nground-truth graphs, we further integrate an auxiliary Kullback-Leibler\ndivergence loss function. To capture time-dependency between two consecutive\nobservations, we impose an l1 loss to minimize the sparse distance between two\nserialized brain graphs. A series of benchmarks against variants and ablated\nversions of our EvoGraphNet showed that we can achieve the lowest brain graph\nevolution prediction error using a single baseline timepoint.

Investigations were carried out in several\ndeaerated solvents using acridone and naphthalene derivatives as a sensitizer\nand emitter, respectively. Both upconversion quantum efficiency and sample\nphotostability under continuous photoirradiation strongly depended on the\nsolvent. The former dependence is governed by the solvent polarity, which\naffects the triplet energy level matching between the sensitizer and emitter\nbecause of the solvatochromism of the sensitizer. To elucidate the latter,\nfirst we investigated the photodegradation of samples without the emitter,\nwhich revealed that the sensitizer degradation rate is correlated with the\ndifference between the frontier orbital energy levels of the sensitizer and\nsolvent. Inclusion of the emitter effectively suppressed the degradation of the\nsensitizer, which is ascribed to fast quenching of the triplet sensitizer by\nthe emitter and justifies the use of ketonic sensitizers for UV-UC in solvents.\nA theoretical model was developed to acquire insight into the observed temporal\ndecays of the upconverted emission intensity under continuous photoirradiation.\nThe theoretical curves generated by this model fitted the experimental decay\ncurves well, which allowed the reaction rate between the emitter and solvent to\nbe obtained.

Galaxies that exhibit similar properties are,\nhowever, also found to be infalling into the cluster for the first time. We use\nthe same simulation to study in detail the history of such a galaxy over cosmic\ntime in order to determine its origin. The bar appears to be triggered at t=6.8\nGyr by the combined effect of the last significant merger with a subhalo and\nthe first passage of another dwarf satellite, both ten times less massive than\nthe galaxy. The satellites deposit all their gas in the galaxy, contributing to\nits third and last star-formation episode, which perturbs the disk and may also\ncontribute to the formation of the bar. The galaxy then starts to lose its gas\nand dark matter due to its passage near a group of more massive galaxies. The\nstrongest interaction involves a galaxy 22 times more massive, leaving the\nbarred galaxy with no gas and half of its maximum dark matter mass. During this\ntime, the bar grows steadily, seemingly unaffected by the interactions,\nalthough they may have aided its growth by stripping the gas. The studied\ngalaxy, together with two other similar objects briefly discussed in this\nletter, suggest the existence of a new class of early-type barred galaxies and\nthereby demonstrate the importance of interactions in galaxy formation and\nevolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Sep 2020 11:59:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-14"}

Strong star-formation\nin the brightest cluster galaxy indicates that AGN feedback has been unable to\ninhibit this cooling flow. We have studied the strong cooling flow in the\nPhoenix cluster by determining the radio properties of the AGN and its lobes.\nIn addition, we use spatially resolved observations to investigate the origin\nof the mini-halo. We present new Very Large Array 1-12 GHz observations of the\nPhoenix cluster which resolve the AGN and its lobes in all four frequency\nbands, and resolve the mini-halo in L- and S-band. Using our L-band\nobservations, we measure the total flux density of the radio lobes at 1.5 GHz\nto be $7.6\\pm0.8$ mJy, and the flux density of the mini-halo to be $8.5\\pm0.9$\nmJy.

Strong time variability of the AGN on\nMyr-timescales may help explain the disconnection between the radio and the\nX-ray properties of the system.

Once this unknown function\nis determined, we compute the Laplace transform and the mean value of the\nsojourn time of a batch in the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Sep 2020 12:23:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-29"}

With the recent development of deep learning techniques and\nlarge-scale datasets, deep face recognition has made remarkable progress and\nbeen widely used in many real-world applications. Given a natural image or\nvideo frame as input, an end-to-end deep face recognition system outputs the\nface feature for recognition. To achieve this, a typical end-to-end system is\nbuilt with three key elements: face detection, face alignment, and face\nrepresentation. The face detection locates faces in the image or frame. Then,\nthe face alignment is proceeded to calibrate the faces to the canonical view\nand crop them with a normalized pixel size. Finally, in the stage of face\nrepresentation, the discriminative features are extracted from the aligned face\nfor recognition. Nowadays, all of the three elements are fulfilled by the\ntechnique of deep convolutional neural network. In this survey article, we\npresent a comprehensive review about the recent advance of each element. To\nstart with, we present an overview of the end-to-end deep face recognition.\nThen, we review the advance of each element, respectively, covering many\naspects such as the to-date algorithm designs, evaluation metrics, datasets,\nperformance comparison, existing challenges, and promising directions for\nfuture research.

We report\none such rare study of resolved HI absorption against the radio galaxy 3C 433\nat $z = 0.101$ with the VLA. The resolved kinematics of the absorber, located\nagainst the southern lobe of the 3C 433, shows that it has regular kinematics\nwith an HI mass $\\lesssim 3.4 \\times 10^{8} M_{\\odot}$ for T$_{spin} =$ 100K.\nOur deep optical continuum and H$\\alpha$ observations from the Gran Telescopio\nCANARIAS (GTC) show that the absorber is a faint disc galaxy in the same\nenvironment as 3C 433 with a stellar mass $\\sim 10^{10} M_{\\odot}$ and a\nstar-formation rate of 0.15 $M_{\\odot}~yr^{-1}$ or less.

Our work supports the potential of\nstudying the HI content in galaxies via absorption in the case of a fortuitous\nalignment with an extended radio continuum.

Nonlinear control methods\nsuch as Reset Control (RC) are needed to overcome these. RC is a promising\ncandidate since, unlike other nonlinear methods, it easily integrates into the\nindustry-preferred PID design framework. Thus far, RC has been analysed in the\nfrequency domain either through describing function analysis or by direct\nclosed-loop numerical computation. The former computes a simplified closed-loop\nRC response by assuming a sufficient low-pass behaviour. In doing so it ignores\nall harmonics, which literature has found to cause significant modelling\nprediction errors. The latter gives a precise solution, but by its direct\nclosed-loop computation does not clearly show how open-loop RC design\ntranslates to closed-loop performance. The main contribution of this work is\naimed at overcoming these limitations by considering an alternative approach\nfor modelling RC using state-dependent impulse inputs. This permits accurately\ncomputing closed-loop RC behaviour starting from the underlying linear system,\nimproving system understanding. A frequency-domain description for closed-loop\nRC is obtained, which is solved analytically by using several well-defined\nassumptions.

Consequently, the loss of\northogonality leads to inter-numerology interference (INI), which complicates\nsignal generation and impedes signal isolation. In this paper, the INI in\nMN-OFDM systems is characterized through mathematical modeling and is shown to\nprimarily rely on system parameters with regard to the pulse shape, the\nrelative distance between subcarriers and the numerology scaling factor.\nReduced-form formulas for the INI in continuous-time and discrete-time MN\nsystems are derived.

To\nsolve this problem, learning should be organized at the task level rather than\nthe sample level.

However, less\nattention has been paid to how hints are presented. In this paper, we propose a\nnew hint delivery mechanism called \"Assertions\" for providing unsolicited hints\nin a data-driven intelligent tutor. Assertions are partially-worked example\nsteps designed to appear within a student workspace, and in the same format as\nstudent-derived steps, to show students a possible subgoal leading to the\nsolution. We hypothesized that Assertions can help address the well-known hint\navoidance problem. In systems that only provide hints upon request, hint\navoidance results in students not receiving hints when they are needed. Our\nunsolicited Assertions do not seek to improve student help-seeking, but rather\nseek to ensure students receive the help they need. We contrast Assertions with\nMessages, text-based, unsolicited hints that appear after student inactivity.\nOur results show that Assertions significantly increase unsolicited hint usage\ncompared to Messages. Further, they show a significant aptitude-treatment\ninteraction between Assertions and prior proficiency, with Assertions leading\nstudents with low prior proficiency to generate shorter (more efficient)\nposttest solutions faster. We also present a clustering analysis that shows\npatterns of productive persistence among students with low prior knowledge when\nthe tutor provides unsolicited help in the form of Assertions.

As CHEOPS carries out its observations in a broad optical\npassband, it can provide insights into the reflected light from exoplanets and\nconstrain the short-wavelength thermal emission for the hottest of planets by\nobserving occultations and phase curves. Here, we report the first CHEOPS\nobservation of an occultation, namely, that of the hot Jupiter WASP-189b, a\n$M_P \\approx 2 M_J$ planet orbiting an A-type star. We detected the occultation\nof WASP-189 b at high significance in individual measurements and derived an\noccultation depth of $dF = 87.9 \\pm 4.3$ppm based on four occultations. We\ncompared these measurements to model predictions and we find that they are\nconsistent with an unreflective atmosphere heated to a temperature of $3435 \\pm\n27$K, when assuming inefficient heat redistribution. Furthermore, we present\ntwo transits of WASP-189b observed by CHEOPS. These transits have an asymmetric\nshape that we attribute to gravity darkening of the host star caused by its\nhigh rotation rate. We used these measurements to refine the planetary\nparameters, finding a $\\sim25\\%$ deeper transit compared to the discovery paper\nand updating the radius of WASP-189b to $1.619\\pm0.021 R_J$. We further\nmeasured the projected orbital obliquity to be $\\lambda =\n86.4^{+2.9}_{-4.4}$deg, a value that is in good agreement with a previous\nmeasurement from spectroscopic observations, and derived a true obliquity of\n$\\Psi = 85.4\\pm4.3$deg.

While this feature improves the accuracy and the\nstability of LBMs for large velocity and temperature fluctuations, it also\nstrongly impacts the efficiency of the algorithm due to space interpolations\nthat are required to get populations at grid nodes. To avoid this defect, the\npresent work proposes new formulations of adaptive LBMs for the simulation of\ncompressible flows which do not rely anymore on space interpolations, hence,\ndrastically improving their parallel efficiency for the simulation of\nhigh-speed compressible flows. To reach this goal, the adaptive phase\ndiscretization is restricted to particular states that are compliant with the\nefficient \"collide and stream\" algorithm, and as a consequence it does not\nrequire additional interpolation steps. The development of proper\nstate-adaptive solvers with on-grid propagation imposes new restrictions and\nchallenges on the discrete stencils, namely the need for an extended\noperability range allowing for the transition between two phase\ndiscretizations. Achieving the minimum operability range for discrete\npolynomial equilibria requires rather large stencils (e.g. D2Q81, D2Q121) and\nis therefore not competitive for compressible flow simulations. However, as\nshown in the article, the use of numerical equilibria can provide for overlaps\nin the operability ranges of neighboring discrete shifts at acceptable cost\nusing the D2Q21 lattice.

The elastic enhancement factor\nis a characteristic of quantum chaotic scattering which is of particular\nimportance in experiments, like compound-nuclear reactions, where only cross\nsections, i.e., the moduli of the associated scattering matrix elements are\naccessible. In the experiment a quantum billiard with the shape of a quarter\nbow-tie, which generates a chaotic dynamics, is emulated by a flat microwave\ncavity. Partial T-invariance violation of varying strength 0 < xi < 1 is\ninduced by two magnetized ferrites.

In FGA, the source and\ntarget point sets are interpreted as rigid particle swarms with masses\ninteracting in a globally multiply-linked manner while moving in a simulated\ngravitational force field. The optimal alignment is obtained by explicit\nmodeling of forces acting on the particles as well as their velocities and\ndisplacements with second-order ordinary differential equations of motion.\nAdditional alignment cues (point-based or geometric features, and other\nboundary conditions) can be integrated into FGA through particle masses. We\npropose a smooth-particle mass function for point mass initialization, which\nimproves robustness to noise and structural discontinuities. To avoid\nprohibitive quadratic complexity of all-to-all point interactions, we adapt a\nBarnes-Hut tree for accelerated force computation and achieve quasilinear\ncomputational complexity. We show that the new method class has characteristics\nnot found in previous alignment methods such as efficient handling of partial\noverlaps, inhomogeneous point sampling densities, and coping with large point\nclouds with reduced runtime compared to the state of the art.
