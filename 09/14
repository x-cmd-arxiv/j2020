Through four consecutive sub-attention modules of FA,\neach element in the feature tensor can aggregate spatial-channel information\nfrom all other elements. Compared to traditional attention methods, with\nmoderate improvement of accuracy, FA can substantially reduce the computational\ncomplexity and GPU memory consumption.

Our results indicate\nthat depending on the application, our method outperforms established baselines\nfor bias detection and future interaction prediction. Finally, we discuss\nfuture research directions based on our proposed modeling paradigm and suggest\nhow practitioners can use this method to build intelligent visualization\nsystems that understand users' goals and adapt to improve the exploration\nprocess.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Sep 2020 16:52:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Oct 2020 03:53:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-19"}

Whereas the\nstate-of-the-art randomized algorithms for this problem are based on the quite\ninvolved local coloring algorithm of Chang et al. (STOC'18), our algorithm can\nbe described in just a few lines. At a high level, it applies a careful\nderandomization of a recursive procedure which partitions the nodes and their\nrespective palettes into separate bins. We show that after $O(1)$ recursion\nsteps, the remaining uncolored subgraph within each bin has linear size, and\nthus can be solved locally by collecting it to a single node. This algorithm\ncan also be implemented in the Massively Parallel Computation (MPC) model\nprovided that each machine has linear (in $n$, the number of nodes in the input\ngraph) space.\n  We also show an extension of our algorithm to the MPC regime in which\nmachines have sublinear space: we present the first deterministic\n$(\\Delta+1)$-list coloring algorithm designed for sublinear-space MPC, which\nruns in $O(\\log \\Delta + \\log\\log n)$ rounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Sep 2020 16:59:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-15"}

Despite the many\nscientific and technological motivations, time-domain, optical-field sampling\nsystems operating in the visible to near-infrared spectral regions are seldom\naccessible, requiring large driving pulse energies, and large laser amplifier\nsystems, bulky apparatuses, and vacuum environments. Here, we demonstrate an\nall-on-chip, optoelectronic device capable of sampling arbitrary, low-energy,\nnear-infrared waveforms under ambient conditions. Our solid-state integrated\ndetector uses optical-field-driven electron emission from resonant nanoantennas\nto achieve petahertz-level switching speeds by generating on-chip attosecond\nelectron bursts. These bursts are used to probe the electric field of weak\noptical transients. We demonstrated our devices by sampling the electric field\nof a ~5 fJ, broadband near-infrared ultrafast laser pulse using a ~50 pJ\nnear-infrared driving pulse.

The key challenge in these systems is to group the \"right\"\nrequests to travel together in the \"right\" available vehicles in real-time, so\nthat the objective (e.g., requests served, revenue or delay) is optimized. This\nchallenge has been addressed in existing work by: (i) generating as many\nrelevant feasible (with respect to the available delay for customers)\ncombinations of requests as possible in real-time; and then (ii) optimizing\nassignment of the feasible request combinations to vehicles. Since the number\nof request combinations increases exponentially with the increase in vehicle\ncapacity and number of requests, unfortunately, such approaches have to employ\nad hoc heuristics to identify a subset of request combinations for assignment.\nOur key contribution is in developing approaches that employ zone (abstraction\nof individual locations) paths instead of request combinations. Zone paths\nallow for generation of significantly more \"relevant\" combinations (in\ncomparison to ad hoc heuristics) in real-time than competing approaches due to\ntwo reasons: (i) Each zone path can typically represent multiple request\ncombinations; (ii) Zone paths are generated using a combination of offline and\nonline methods. Specifically, we contribute both myopic (ridesharing assignment\nfocussed on current requests only) and non-myopic (ridesharing assignment\nconsiders impact on expected future requests) approaches that employ zone\npaths. In our experimental results, we demonstrate that our myopic approach\noutperforms (with respect to both objective and runtime) the current best\nmyopic approach for ridesharing on both real-world and synthetic datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Sep 2020 17:57:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-15"}

In the context of computer engineering, the\ntranslation of legal text to algorithmic form is seemingly direct. In large\npart, law may be a ripe field for expert systems and machine learning. For\nengineers, existing law appears formulaic and logically reducible to \"if, then\"\nstatements. The underlying assumption is that the legal language is both\nself-referential and universal. Moreover, description is considered distinct\nfrom interpretation; that in describing the law, the language is seen as\nquantitative and objectifiable. Nevertheless, is descriptive formal language\npurely dissociative? From the logic machine of the 1970s to the modern fervor\nfor artificial intelligence (AI), governance by numbers is making a persuasive\nreturn. Could translation be possible? The project follows a fundamentally\nsemantic conundrum: what is the significance of \"meaning\" in legal language?\nThe project, therefore, tests translation by deconstructing sentences from\nexisting legal judgments to their constituent factors.

Likewise, the\nstudy of NP-Complete problems lies at the heart of computer science with\nnumerous results in algorithms and complexity. In this paper we raise the\nquestion of computing fault tolerant solutions to NP-Complete problems; that is\ncomputing a solution that can survive the \"failure\" of a few constituent\nelements. This notion has appeared in a variety of theoretical and practical\nsettings such as estimating network reliability, kernelization (aka instance\ncompression), approximation algorithms and so on. In this paper, we seek to\nhighlight these questions for further research.\n  As a concrete example, we study the fault-tolerant version of the classical\nFeedback Vertex Set (FVS) problem, that we call Fault Tolerant Feedback Vertex\nSet (FT-FVS). Recall that, in FVS the input is a graph $G$ and the objective is\nto compute a minimum subset of vertices $S$ such that $G-S$ is a forest. In\nFT-FVS, the objective is to compute a minimum subset $S$ of vertices such that\n$G - (S \\setminus \\{v\\})$ is a forest for any $v \\in V(G)$. Here the vertex $v$\ndenotes a single vertex fault. We show that this problem is NP-Complete, and\nthen present a constant factor approximation algorithm as well as an\nFPT-algorithm parameterized by the solution size. We believe that the question\nof computing fault tolerant solutions to various NP-Complete problems is an\ninteresting direction for future research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Sep 2020 18:49:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-15"}

The analysis in this work reveals the\nprimary is potentially an inflated hot subdwarf (sdO) and more likely is a\nrarer post-blue horizontal branch (post-BHB) star. Post-BHBs are the\nshort-lived shell-burning final stage of a blue horizontal star or hot subdwarf\nbefore transitioning to a WD. This object was discovered using Evryscope\nphotometric data in a southern-all-sky hot subdwarf variability survey. The\nphotometric light curve for EVR-CB-004 shows multi-component variability from\nellipsoidal deformation of the primary and from Doppler boosting as well as\ngravitational limb darkening. EVR-CB-004 is one of just a handful of known\nsystems, and has a long period (6.08426 hours) and large amplitude ellipsoidal\nmodulation (16.0 $\\%$ change in brightness from maximum to minimum) for these\nextremely close binary systems, while the properties of the primary make it a\ntruly unique system. EVR-CB-004 also shows a peculiar low-amplitude (less than\n$1\\%$) sinusoidal light curve variation with a period that is a 1/3 resonance\nof the binary period. We tentatively identify this additional variation source\nas a tidally-induced resonant pulsation, and we suggest followup observations\nthat could verify this interpretation. From the evolutionary state of the\nsystem, its components, and its mass fraction, EVR-CB-004 is a strong merger\ncandidate to form a single high-mass ($\\approx1.2M_{\\odot}$) WD. EVR-CB-004\noffers a glimpse into a brief phase of a remnant core evolution and secondary\nvariation, not seen before in a compact binary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Sep 2020 20:00:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-21"}

Some of those apps leverage attenuation of Bluetooth beacons\nfrom mobile devices to build a record of proximate encounters between a pair of\ndevice owners. The underlying protocols are known to suffer from false positive\nand re-identification attacks. We present evidence that the attacker's\ndifficulty in mounting such attacks has been overestimated. Indeed, an attacker\nleveraging a moderately successful app or SDK with Bluetooth and location\naccess can eavesdrop and interfere with these proximity tracing systems at no\nhardware cost and perform these attacks against users who do not have this app\nor SDK installed. We describe concrete examples of actors who would be in a\ngood position to execute such attacks. We further present a novel attack, which\nwe call a biosurveillance attack, which allows the attacker to monitor the\nexposure risk of a smartphone user who installs their app or SDK but who does\nnot use any contact tracing system and may falsely believe that they have opted\nout of the system.\n  Through traffic auditing with an instrumented testbed, we characterize\nprecisely the behaviour of one such SDK that we found in a handful of\napps---but installed on more than one hundred million mobile devices. Its\nbehaviour is functionally indistinguishable from a re-identification or\nbiosurveillance attack and capable of executing a false positive attack with\nminimal effort. We also discuss how easily an attacker could acquire a position\nconducive to such attacks, by leveraging the lax logic for granting permissions\nto apps in the Android framework: any app with some geolocation permission\ncould acquire the necessary Bluetooth permission through an upgrade, without\nany additional user prompt. Finally we discuss motives for conducting such\nattacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Sep 2020 20:06:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-15"}

One major challenge is how to\neffectively borrow information from historical data while maintaining a\nreasonable type I error. We propose the elastic prior approach to address this\nchallenge and achieve dynamic information borrowing. Unlike existing\napproaches, this method proactively controls the behavior of dynamic\ninformation borrowing and type I errors by incorporating a well-known concept\nof clinically meaningful difference through an elastic function, defined as a\nmonotonic function of a congruence measure between historical data and trial\ndata. The elastic function is constructed to satisfy a set of\ninformation-borrowing constraints prespecified by researchers or regulatory\nagencies, such that the prior will borrow information when historical and trial\ndata are congruent, but refrain from information borrowing when historical and\ntrial data are incongruent. In doing so, the elastic prior improves power and\nreduces the risk of data dredging and bias. The elastic prior is information\nborrowing consistent, i.e. asymptotically controls type I and II errors at the\nnominal values when historical data and trial data are not congruent, a unique\ncharacteristics of the elastic prior approach. Our simulation study that\nevaluates the finite sample characteristic confirms that, compared to existing\nmethods, the elastic prior has better type I error control and yields\ncompetitive or higher power.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Sep 2020 20:43:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 13 Dec 2020 19:16:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-15"}

The best data structure known for this problem simply builds a\ncut-equivalent tree, discovered 60 years ago by Gomory and Hu, who also showed\nhow to construct it using $n-1$ minimum $st$-cut computations. Using\nstate-of-the-art algorithms for minimum $st$-cut (Lee and Sidford, FOCS 2014)\narXiv:1312.6713, one can construct the tree in time $\\tilde{O}(mn^{3/2})$,\nwhich is also the preprocessing time of the data structure. (Throughout, we\nfocus on polynomially-bounded edge weights, noting that faster algorithms are\nknown for small/unit edge weights.)\n  Our main result shows the following equivalence: Cut-equivalent trees can be\nconstructed in near-linear time if and only if there is a data structure for\nMin-Cut queries with near-linear preprocessing time and polylogarithmic\n(amortized) query time, and even if the queries are restricted to a fixed\nsource. That is, equivalent trees are an essentially optimal solution for\nMin-Cut queries. This equivalence holds even for every minor-closed family of\ngraphs, such as bounded-treewidth graphs, for which a two-decade old data\nstructure (Arikati et al., J.~Algorithms 1998) implies the first near-linear\ntime construction of cut-equivalent trees.\n  Moreover, unlike all previous techniques for constructing cut-equivalent\ntrees, ours is robust to relying on approximation algorithms. In particular,\nusing the almost-linear time algorithm for $(1+\\epsilon)$-approximate minimum\n$st$-cut (Kelner et al., SODA 2014), we can construct a\n$(1+\\epsilon)$-approximate flow-equivalent tree (which is a slightly weaker\nnotion) in time $n^{2+o(1)}$.

In this study, we\ntake a design-science perspective to propose a recommendation framework that\nhelps users to select healthcare interventions. Taking into account that users'\nhealth behaviors can be highly dynamic and diverse, we propose a multi-armed\nbandit (MAB)-driven recommendation framework, which enables us to adaptively\nlearn users' preference variations while promoting recommendation diversity in\nthe meantime. To better adapt an MAB to the healthcare context, we synthesize\ntwo innovative model components based on prominent health theories.

It assists in quicker clinical assessment and early\ndetection of brain tumors, which is crucial for lifesaving treatment procedures\nof patients. Because, brain tumors often can be malignant or benign, if they\nare detected at an early stage. A brain tumor is a collection or a mass of\nabnormal cells in the brain. The human skull encloses the brain very rigidly\nand any growth inside this restricted place can cause severe health issues. The\ndetection of brain tumors requires careful and intricate analysis for surgical\nplanning and treatment. Most physicians employ Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)\nto diagnose such tumors. A manual diagnosis of the tumors using MRI is known to\nbe time-consuming; approximately, it takes up to eighteen hours per sample.\nThus, the automatic segmentation of tumors has become an optimal solution for\nthis problem. Studies have shown that this technique provides better accuracy\nand it is faster than manual analysis resulting in patients receiving the\ntreatment at the right time. Our research introduces an efficient strategy\ncalled Multi-channel MRI embedding to improve the result of deep learning-based\ntumor segmentation.

We use simulations to demonstrate our newly-developed methods and show\nthat, for an idealised instrument, a 21-cm signal could theoretically be\nextracted from the visibilities of an array of closely-spaced dipoles. We\nverify that our signal-extraction methods work on real data using observations\nmade with a Square Kilometre-Array-like prototype; the Engineering Development\nArray-2. Finally, we use the lessons learned in both our simulations and\nobservations to lay out a clear plan for future work, which will ultimately\nlead to a new global redshifted 21-cm instrument: the All-Sky SignAl\nShort-Spacing INterferometer (ASSASSIN).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 2020 02:00:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-15"}

This task can be\nformulated either in a weak way, where one node outputs 'leader' and all other\nnodes output 'non-leader', or in a strong way, where all nodes must also learn\nwhich node is the leader. If the nodes of the network have distinct\nidentifiers, then such an agreement means that all nodes have to output the\nidentifier of the elected leader. For anonymous networks, the strong version of\nleader election requires that all nodes must be able to find a path to the\nleader, as this is the only way to identify it. For any network in which leader\nelection (weak or strong) is possible knowing the map of the network, there is\na minimum time in which this can be done. We consider four formulations of\nleader election discussed in the literature in the context of anonymous\nnetworks : one is the weak formulation, and the three others specify three\ndifferent ways of finding the path to the leader in the strong formulation. Our\naim is to compare the amount of initial information needed to accomplish each\nof these \"four shades\" of leader election in minimum time. We show that the\namount of information required to accomplish leader election in the weak\nformulation in minimum time is exponentially smaller than that needed for any\nof the strong formulations. Thus, if the required amount of advice is used as a\nmeasure of the difficulty of the task, the weakest version of leader election\nin minimum time is drastically easier than any version of the strong\nformulation in minimum time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 2020 02:05:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-15"}

AutomML tools are now used to achieve state of\nthe art NNA designs and attempt to optimize for hardware usage and design. Much\nof the recent research in the auto-design of NNAs has focused on convolution\nnetworks and image recognition, ignoring the fact that a significant part of\nthe workload in data centers is general-purpose deep neural networks. In this\nwork, we develop and test a general multilayer perceptron (MLP) flow that can\ntake arbitrary datasets as input and automatically produce optimized NNAs and\nhardware designs. We test the flow on six benchmarks. Our results show we\nexceed the performance of currently published MLP accuracy results and are\ncompetitive with non-MLP based results. We compare general and common GPU\narchitectures with our scalable FPGA design and show we can achieve higher\nefficiency and higher throughput (outputs per second) for the majority of\ndatasets. Further insights into the design space for both accurate networks and\nhigh performing hardware shows the power of co-design by correlating accuracy\nversus throughput, network size versus accuracy, and scaling to\nhigh-performance devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 2020 02:37:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-15"}

The consequences of merging\ndouble strangeon stars are worth exploring, especially in the new era of\nmulti-messenger astronomy. To develop the \"strangeon kilonova\" scenario\nproposed in Paper I, we make a qualitative description about the evolution of\nejecta and light curves for merging double strangeon stars. In the hot\nenvironment of the merger, the strangeon nuggets ejected by tidal disruption\nand hydrodynamical squeezing would suffer from evaporation, in which process\nparticles, such as strangeons, neutrons and protons, are emitted. Taking into\naccount both the evaporation of strangeon nuggets and the decay of strangeons,\nmost of the strangeon nuggets would turn into neutrons and protons, within\ndozens of milliseconds after being ejected. The evaporation rates of different\nparticles depend on temperature, and we find that the ejecta could end up with\ntwo components, with high and low opacity respectively. The high opacity\ncomponent would be in the directions around the equatorial plane, and the low\nopacity component would be in a broad range of angular directions. The\nbolometric light curves show that even if the total ejected mass would be as\nlow as $\\sim 10^{-4} M_\\odot$, the spin-down power of the long-lived remnant\nwould account for the whole emission of kilonova AT2017gfo associated with GW\n170817.

In order to sustain long-term\nparticipation of data owners, it is important to fairly appraise each data\nsource and compensate data owners for their contribution to the training\nprocess. The Shapley value (SV) defines a unique payoff scheme that satisfies\nmany desiderata for a data value notion. It has been increasingly used for\nvaluing training data in centralized learning. However, computing the SV\nrequires exhaustively evaluating the model performance on every subset of data\nsources, which incurs prohibitive communication cost in the federated setting.\nBesides, the canonical SV ignores the order of data sources during training,\nwhich conflicts with the sequential nature of FL. This paper proposes a variant\nof the SV amenable to FL, which we call the federated Shapley value. The\nfederated SV preserves the desirable properties of the canonical SV while it\ncan be calculated without incurring extra communication cost and is also able\nto capture the effect of participation order on data value. We conduct a\nthorough empirical study of the federated SV on a range of tasks, including\nnoisy label detection, adversarial participant detection, and data\nsummarization on different benchmark datasets, and demonstrate that it can\nreflect the real utility of data sources for FL and has the potential to\nenhance system robustness, security, and efficiency.

However, due to several\nfactors, such as weather and satellite coverage, it is often uncertain which\ndata modality will be the first available for rapid disaster response efforts.\nHence, novel methodologies that can utilize all accessible EO datasets are\nessential for disaster management.

Turbulent flows leading to random motion of\nfluid elements may affect the structure of the extracellular polymeric matrix\nproduced by bacteria. Here we show that two-dimensional turbulence at the\nair-liquid interface generates chaotic rotation at a well-defined scale and\nrandom persistent stretching of the fluid elements.

Therefore, finding an\naccurate mapping of the latent factors across domains or systems is crucial to\nenhancing recommendation accuracy.

To this end, in this paper, we propose a Deep\nframework for both Cross-Domain and Cross-System Recommendations, called\nDCDCSR, based on Matrix Factorization (MF) models and a fully connected Deep\nNeural Network (DNN).

Instead, equality path constraint residuals are forced to\nzero everywhere by an integral quadratic penalty term. We highlight conceptual\ndifferences between collocation- and penalty-type direct transcription methods.\nTheoretical convergence results for both types of methods are reviewed and\ncompared. Formulas for implementing PBF are presented, with details on the\nformulation as a nonlinear program (NLP), sparsity and solution.

By evaluating the re-emission of the trapped charge observed\nbehind the CI rows, we find that there are at least three trap populations with\ndifferent time constants. The traps with the shortest time constant, which is\nequivalent to a transfer time of approximately one pixel, are mainly\nresponsible for the trailing charge of an X-ray event seen in the following\npixel. A comparison of the trailing charge in two clocking modes reveals that\nthe CTI depends not only on the transfer time but also on the area, namely the\nimaging or storage area. We construct a new CTI model with taking into account\nwith both transfer-time and area dependence. This model reproduces the data\nobtained in both clocking modes consistently. We also examine apparent flux\ndependence of the CTI observed without the CI technique. The higher incident\nX-ray flux is, the lower the CTI value becomes.

In UGKWP, the evolution of microscopic velocity\ndistribution is coupled with the evolution of macroscopic variables, and the\nparticle evolution as well as the macroscopic fluxes are modeled from the time\naccumulating solution up to a time step scale from the kinetic model equation.\n  For plasma transport, current scheme provides a smooth transition from\nparticle in cell (PIC) method in the rarefied regime to the magnetohydrodynamic\n(MHD) solver in the continuum regime. In the continuum limit, the cell size and\ntime step of the UGKWP method is not restricted to be less than the mean free\npath and mean collision time. In the highly magnetized regime, the cell size\nand time step are not restricted by the Debye length and plasma cyclotron\nperiod. The multiscale and asymptotic complexity diminishing properties of the\nscheme are verified by numerical tests in multiple flow regimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 2020 08:36:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Sep 2020 04:36:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-21"}

It is conjectured that a gravitational theory in\n$d+1$ dimensional wedge spacetime is dual to a $d-1$ dimensional CFT on the\ncorner of the wedge. In this paper, we give an exact construction of the\ngravitational solutions for wedge holography from the ones in AdS/CFT. By\napplying this construction, we prove the equivalence between wedge holography\nand AdS/CFT for vacuum Einstein gravity, by showing that the classical\ngravitational action and thus the CFT partition function in large N limit are\nthe same for the two theories. The equivalence to AdS/CFT can be regarded as a\n\"proof\" of wedge holography in a certain sense. As an application of this\npowerful equivalence, we derive easily the holographic Weyl anomaly,\nholographic Entanglement/R\\'enyi entropy and correlation functions for wedge\nholography. Besides, we discuss the general solutions of wedge holography and\nargue that they correspond to the AdS/CFT with suitable matter fields.\nInterestingly, we notice that the intrinsic Ricci scalar on the brane is always\na constant, which depends on the tension. Finally, we generalize the\ndiscussions to dS/CFT and flat space holography.

These approaches overlook many potential training\nsignals contained in dialogue data, which might be beneficial for context\nunderstanding and produce better features for response prediction. Besides, the\nresponse retrieved from existing dialogue systems supervised by the\nconventional way still faces some critical challenges, including incoherence\nand inconsistency.

We use the 1D radiative/convective code ATMO with\nad-hoc modifications of the temperature gradient to model the rotational\nspectral modulation of 2MASS 1821, 2MASS 0136, and PSO 318.5-22.\n  Modeling the spectral bright-to-faint ratio of the modulation of 2MASS 1821,\n2MASS 0136, and PSO 318.5-22 shows that most spectral characteristics can be\nreproduced by temperature variations alone. Furthermore, the approximately\nanti-correlated variability between different wavelengths can be easily\ninterpreted as a change in the temperature gradient in the atmosphere which is\nthe consequence we expect from CO/CH4 radiative convection to explain the L/T\ntransition. The deviation from an exact anti-correlation could then be\ninterpreted as a phase shift similar to the hot-spot shift a different\nbandpasses in the atmosphere of hot Jupiters.

However, the haze\ncomposition and its production mechanisms are not fully understood, and\nobservational information is still limited. Aims: We aim to study the presence\nof hazes in the atmospheres of HD 209458 b and HD 189733 b with high spectral\nresolution spectra by analysing the strength of water vapour cross-correlation\nsignals across the red optical and near-infrared wavelength ranges. Methods: A\ntotal of seven transits of the two planets were observed with the CARMENES\nspectrograph at the 3.5 m Calar Alto telescope. Their Doppler-shifted signals\nwere disentangled from the telluric and stellar contributions using the\ndetrending algorithm SYSREM. The residual spectra were subsequently\ncross-correlated with water vapour templates at 0.70-0.96 $\\mu$m to measure the\nstrength of the water vapour absorption bands. Results: The optical water\nvapour bands were detected at $5.2 \\sigma$ in HD 209458 b in one transit,\nwhereas no evidence of them was found in four transits of HD 189733 b.\nTherefore, the relative strength of the optical water bands compared to those\nin the near-infrared were found to be larger in HD 209458 b than in HD 189733\nb. Conclusions: We interpret the non-detection of optical water bands in the\ntransmission spectra of HD 189733 b, compared to the detection in HD 209458 b,\nto be due to the presence of high-altitude hazes in the former planet, which\nare largely absent in the latter. This is consistent with previous measurements\nwith the Hubble Space Telescope. We show that currently available CARMENES\nobservations of hot Jupiters can be used to investigate the presence of haze\nextinction in their atmospheres.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 2020 09:17:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-28"}

In this paper, we present a first analysis of\nemerging ARs from the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Helioseismic Emerging Active\nRegions (SDO/HEAR) dataset (Schunker et al. 2016) using deep convolutional\nneural networks (CNN) to characterize pre-emergence surface magnetic-field\nproperties.

Missing information can\nbe restored well in this region, especially in HR videos, where the\nhigh-frequency content mostly consists of texture details. The task in this\nchallenge is to upscale videos with an extreme factor of 16, which results in\nmore serious degradations that also affect the structural integrity of the\nvideos. A single pixel in the low-resolution (LR) domain corresponds to 256\npixels in the high-resolution (HR) domain. Due to this massive information\nloss, it is hard to accurately restore the missing information.

It is shown that the effective low-energy\nprecession dynamics cannot be derived from an effective Hamilton function and\nis characterized by a non-vanishing precession frequency even if the initial\nstate deviates only slightly from a ground state. The effective theory is\ncompared to the fully numerical solution of the equations of motion for the\nwhole system of impurity and host spins to identify the parameter regime where\nthe adiabatic effective theory applies. Effective theories beyond the adiabatic\napproximation must necessarily include dynamic host degrees of freedom and go\nbeyond the idea of a simple indirect magnetic exchange.

Further, this work optimizes regions of parameter space to match\nsimulation results from the stochastic Hill function with the distributive\nmultisite phosphorylation process. While traditional parameter optimization\nmethods have been focusing on finding the best parameter vector, in most\ncircumstances modelers would like to find a set of parameter vectors that\ngenerate similar system dynamics and results. This paper proposes a general\n$\\alpha$-$\\beta$-$\\gamma$ rule to return an acceptable parameter region of the\nstochastic Hill function based on a quasi-Newton stochastic optimization\n(QNSTOP) algorithm. Different objective functions are investigated\ncharacterizing different features of the simulation-based empirical data, among\nwhich the approximate maximum log-likelihood method is recommended for general\napplications. Numerical results demonstrate that with an appropriate parameter\nvector value, the stochastic Hill function model depicts the multisite\nphosphorylation process well except the initial (transient) period.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 2020 10:27:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-15"}

The model is semiclassical\nin nature and uses as a source of gravity the effective stress-energy tensor\n(SET) corresponding to vacuum polarization of quantum fields, and a minimum\nspherical radius is a few orders of magnitude larger than the Planck length, so\nthat the effects of quantum gravity should be still negligible. We estimate the\nother quantum contributions to the effective SET, caused by a nontrivial\ntopology of spatial sections and particle production from vacuum due to a\nnonstationary gravitational field and show that these contributions are\nnegligibly small as compared to the SET due to vacuum polarization. The same is\nshown for such classical phenomena as accretion of different kinds of matter to\nthe black hole and its further motion to the would-be singularity. Thus, in a\nclear sense, our model of a semiclassical bounce instead of a Schwarzschild\nsingularity is stable under both quantum and classical perturbations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 2020 11:22:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-20"}

BeeP assumes that the compact sources present in\nPCCS2 at 857 GHz have a dust-like spectral energy distribution, which leads to\nemission at both lower and higher frequencies, and adjusts the parameters of\nthe source and its SED to fit the emission observed in Planck's three highest\nfrequency channels at 353, 545, and 857 GHz, as well as the IRIS map at 3000\nGHz. In order to reduce confusion regarding diffuse cirrus emission, BeeP's\ndata model includes a description of the background emission surrounding each\nsource, and it adjusts the confidence in the source parameter extraction based\non the statistical properties of the spatial distribution of the background\nemission. BeeP produces the following three new sets of parameters for each\nsource: (a) fits to a modified blackbody (MBB) thermal emission model of the\nsource; (b) SED-independent source flux densities at each frequency considered;\nand (c) fits to an MBB model of the background in which the source is embedded.\nBeeP also calculates, for each source, a reliability parameter, which takes\ninto account confusion due to the surrounding cirrus.

For the second class, a necessary\nand sufficient condition for the vanishing of cosmological backreaction on a\nscale of homogeneity is expressed through integral constraints.

Observations of static\nstarless cores at early stages of collapse confirm the theoretical expectation\nthat nitrogen fractionation in interstellar conditions is marginal for most\nspecies. Yet, observed isotopic ratios in N2H+ are at variance with model\npredictions. These gaps in our understanding of how the isotopic reservoirs of\nnitrogen evolve, from interstellar clouds to comets, and, more generally, to\nprotosolar nebulae, may have their origin in missing processes or\nmisconceptions in the chemistry of interstellar nitrogen. So far, theoretical\nstudies of nitrogen fractionation in starless cores have addressed the\nquasi-static phase of their evolution such that the effect of dynamical\ncollapse on the isotopic ratio is not known. In this paper, we investigate the\nfractionation of 14N and 15N during the gravitational collapse of a pre-stellar\ncore through gas-phase and grain adsorption and desorption reactions. The\ninitial chemical conditions, which are obtained in steady state after typically\na few Myr, show low degrees of fractionation in the gas phase, in agreement\nwith earlier studies. However, during collapse, the differential rate of\nadsorption of 14N- and 15N-containing species onto grains results in enhanced\n15N:14N ratios, in better agreement with the observations.

Comparison of these constraints with the full distribution of\ntheoretical properties not only help ascertain the prevalence of observed\nproperties in nature, but can also reveal currently unobserved populations. In\nthis follow-up paper, we use the large grid of models presented in Sravan et\nal. 2019 to derive distributions of single and binary SNe IIb progenitor\nproperties and compare them to constraints from three independent observational\nprobes: multi-band SN light-curves, direct progenitor detections, and\nX-ray/radio observations. Consistent with previous work, we find that while\ncurrent observations exclude single stars as SN IIb progenitors, SN IIb\nprogenitors in binaries can account for them. We also find that the\ndistributions indicate the existence of an unobserved dominant population of\nbinary SNe IIb at low metallicity that arise due to mass transfer initiated on\nthe Hertzsprung Gap. In particular, our models indicate the existence of a\ngroup of highly stripped (envelope mass ~0.1-0.2 M_sun) progenitors that are\ncompact (<50 R_sun) and blue (T_eff <~ 10^5K) with ~10^4.5-10^5.5 L_sun and low\ndensity circumstellar mediums. As discussed in Sravan et al. 2019, this group\nis necessary to account for SN IIb fractions and likely exist regardless of\nmetallicity. The detection of the unobserved populations indicated by our\nmodels would support weak stellar winds and inefficient mass transfer in SN IIb\nprogenitors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 2020 12:50:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-11"}

Decorators have been\nproposed as flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.\nStill, the Decorator pattern has certain limitations, especially related to the\nfact that in its classical form it is constrained to a single interface, which\nis implicitly defined by the type of the concrete components that we intend to\ndecorate. Another problem associated to the Decorator pattern is related to the\nlinear composition of the decorations, which could lead to problems in\naccessing the newly added responsibilities. In this context, the paper presents\nvariants of the Decorator pattern: MixDecorator and D2Decorator, and a variant\nspecific only to C++ language based on templates - HybridDecorator.\nMixDecorator could be considered a new enhanced version of the Decorator\npattern that eliminates some constraints of the Decorator pattern, but also it\ncould be used as a base of a general extension mechanism. The main advantage of\nusing MixDecorator is that it allows direct access to all newly added\nresponsibilities, and so, we may combine different interface-responsibilities\n(newly added public methods) and operate with them directly and in any order,\nhiding the linear composition of the decorations. D2Decorator is a variant\nbased on a double-dispatch mechanism. The C++ metaprogramming mechanism based\non templates allows an interesting hybrid variant of the Decorator -\nHybridDecorator, which mixes on-demand defined inheritance with composition.\nUsing these variants of the Decorator pattern we are not longer limited to one\nsingle interface; the set of the messages that could be sent to an object could\nbe enlarged, and so, we may consider that using them, we can dynamically change\nthe type of objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 2020 12:58:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-15"}

Acoustic coupling of\noral and nasal tracts results in a complex production system, which is\nsubjected to a continuous changes owing to glottal activity. Identification of\nthe duration of nasalization in vowels, and the extent of coupling of oral and\nnasal tracts, is a challenging task. The present research focuses on the\nchanges in instantaneous vocal tract system response to study the effects of\nco--articulatory load of nasals on vowels. The dominant resonance frequency\n(DRF) contour derived from the spectra illustrates the contribution of oral and\nnasal resonances during nasalization. The extent of coupling determines the\ndominance of these resonances during glottal open and closed phases. A higher\nextent leads to more decay of energy for the oral resonances, and hence the\nvowel spectra exhibits a dominant nasal resonance. A comparison of the proposed\nparameters is made with the previously suggested measures.

Such records must be representative of the\nin-situ seismicity in terms of a wide range of intensity measures (IMs)\nincluding peak ground acceleration (PGA), Arias intensity (AI), cumulative\nabsolute velocity (CAV), source-to-site distance, duration, among others. No\nsingle IM is a sufficient descriptor of a given seismic demand (e.g. crest\nsettlement) because different records, all of them compliant with any IM, can\nproduce a very wide range of results from insignificant damage to global\nfailure. The use of brute force, where hundreds of seismic records compliant\nwith a set of IMs are employed, has proven to be a reasonable workaround of\nthis limitation, at least able to produce a probabilistic density function of\ndemand indicators. This procedure, however, requires a large number of runs,\nand is therefore expensive and time-consuming.

In order to\nperform a more precise selection, a semi-analytical screening procedure is\npresented in this paper.

The PEMFC operates\nunder full passive conditions, with an air-breathing cathode and a dead-end\nanode supplied with static ambient air and dry hydrogen, respectively. A\ncolumnar cathodic plate favors the mobility of water drops over the cathode\nsurface and their elimination. Thermal neutron images show liquid water build\nup during operation with the cell in vertical and horizontal positions, i.e.\nwith its main plane aligned parallel and perpendicular to the gravity field,\nrespectively. Polarization curves and impedance spectroscopy show cell\norientation dependent response that can be related with the water accumulation\nprofiles. In vertical position, lower water contents in the cathode electrode\nis favored by the elimination of water drops rolling over the cathode surface\nand the onset of natural convection. As a consequence, oxygen transport is\nimproved in the vertical cell, that can be operated full passive for hours\nunder ambient conditions, providing steady peak power densities above 100\nmW/cm2. Gravity and natural convection are less effective in horizontal\nposition, leading to a 17% decrease in peak power density due to oxygen\ntransport losses. The horizontal position is especially adverse if the upper\nelectrode is the cathode, because of anode flooding causing cell failure after\nproduction of a small amount of water (5 mg/cm2). The combined information from\nthermal neutron radiography and cell response characteristics explains the\nimportant influence of cell orientation on the performance of a fully passive\nair-breathing PEMFC for portable applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 2020 13:42:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-15"}

The delocalization, separation and spreading\nof the wave packets lead to decoherence and dispersion effects, which modify\nthe plane-wave neutrino oscillation pattern, by amounts that depend on the\nenergy uncertainties in the initial neutrino wave packets. We find that MBRO\nexperiments could be sensitive to the wave-packet impact, since the baseline is\nlong enough and also the capability of observing small corrections to the\nneutrino oscillations due to excellent detector energy resolution. Besides\nstudying the constraints on the decoherence parameter, we also examine the\npotential wave-packet impacts on the precision of measuring $\\theta_{12}$ and\nother oscillation parameters in the future medium-baseline reactor neutrino\noscillation experiments.

Most discussions of an aerial\nbiosphere in the Venus atmosphere temperate layers never address whether the\nlife-small microbial-type particles-is free floating or confined to the liquid\nenvironment inside cloud droplets. We argue that life must reside inside liquid\ndroplets such that it will be protected from a fatal net loss of liquid to the\natmosphere, an unavoidable problem for any free-floating microbial life forms.\nHowever, the droplet habitat poses a lifetime limitation: Droplets inexorably\ngrow (over a few months) to large enough sizes that are forced by gravity to\nsettle downward to hotter, uninhabitable layers of the Venusian atmosphere.\n(Droplet fragmentation-which would reduce particle size-does not occur in\nVenusian atmosphere conditions.) We propose for the first time that the only\nway life can survive indefinitely is with a life cycle that involves microbial\nlife drying out as liquid droplets evaporate during settling, with the small\ndesiccated 'spores' halting at, and partially populating, the Venus atmosphere\nstagnant lower haze layer (33-48 km altitude). We, thus, call the Venusian\nlower haze layer a 'depot' for desiccated microbial life. The spores eventually\nreturn to the cloud layer by upward diffusion caused by mixing induced by\ngravity waves, act as cloud condensation nuclei, and rehydrate for a continued\nlife cycle. We also review the challenges for life in the extremely harsh\nconditions of the Venusian atmosphere, refuting the notion that the 'habitable'\ncloud layer has an analogy in any terrestrial environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 2020 14:28:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-17"}

Due to security, performance and/or usability\nissues these features have attracted steady criticism. One such feature is the\nIntel Memory Protection Extensions (MPX), an instruction set architecture\nextension promising spatial memory safety at a lower performance cost due to\nhardware-accelerated bounds checking. However, recent investigations into MPX\nhave found that is neither as performant, accurate, nor precise as cutting-edge\nsoftware-based spatial memory safety. As a direct consequence, compiler and\noperating system support for MPX is dying, and Intel has begun to manufacture\ndesktop CPUs without MPX. Nonetheless, given how ubiquitous MPX is, it provides\nan excellent yet under-utilized hardware resource that can be aptly salvaged\nfor security purposes. In this paper, we propose Simplex, a library framework\nthat re-purposes MPX registers as general purpose registers. Using Simplex, we\ndemonstrate how MPX registers can be used to store sensitive information (e.g.,\nencryption keys) directly on the hardware. We evaluate Simplex for performance\nand find that its overhead is small enough to permit its deployment in all but\nthe most performance-intensive code.

Decisions on \"How\nmuch analytics is needed\"? are hard to answer. ROI could guide for decision\nsupport on the What?, How?, and How Much? analytics for a given problem.\nMethod: The proposed conceptual framework is validated through two empirical\nstudies that focus on requirements dependencies extraction in the Mozilla\nFirefox project. The two case studies are (i) Evaluation of fine-tuned BERT\nagainst Naive Bayes and Random Forest machine learners for binary dependency\nclassification and (ii) Active Learning against passive Learning (random\nsampling) for REQUIRES dependency extraction. For both the cases, their\nanalysis investment (cost) is estimated, and the achievable benefit from DA is\npredicted, to determine a break-even point of the investigation. Results: For\nthe first study, fine-tuned BERT performed superior to the Random Forest,\nprovided that more than 40% of training data is available. For the second,\nActive Learning achieved higher F1 accuracy within fewer iterations and higher\nROI compared to Baseline (Random sampling based RF classifier). In both the\nstudies, estimate on, How much analysis likely would pay off for the invested\nefforts?, was indicated by the break-even point. Conclusions: Decisions for the\ndepth and breadth of DA of empirical data should not be made solely based on\nthe accuracy measures. Since ROI-driven Data Analytics provides a simple yet\neffective direction to discover when to stop further investigation while\nconsidering the cost and value of the various types of analysis, it helps to\navoid over-analyzing empirical data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 2020 14:49:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-15"}

Deflecting the\nasteroid from the impact trajectory is an important way to mitigate the threat.\nA kinetic impactor remains to be the most feasible method to deflect the\nasteroid. However, due to the constraint of the launch capability, an impactor\nwith the limited mass can only produce a very limited amount of velocity\nincrement for the asteroid. In order to improve the deflection efficiency of\nthe kinetic impactor strategy, this paper proposed a new concept called the\nAssembled Kinetic Impactor (AKI), which is combining the spacecraft with the\nlaunch vehicle final stage. By making full use of the mass of the launch\nvehicle final stage, the mass of the impactor will be increased, which will\ncause the improvement of the deflection efficiency. According to the technical\ndata of Long March 5 (CZ-5) launch vehicle, the missions of deflecting Bennu\nare designed to demonstrate the power of the AKI concept. Simulation results\nshow that, compared with the Classic Kinetic Impactor (CKI, performs\nspacecraft-rocket separation), the addition of the mass of the launch vehicle\nfinal stage can increase the deflection distance to more than 3 times, and\nreduce the launch lead-time by at least 15 years. With the requirement of the\nsame deflection distance, the addition of the mass of the launch vehicle final\nstage can reduce the number of launches to 1/3 of that of the number of CKI\nlaunches. The AKI concept makes it possible to defend Bennu-like large\nasteroids by a no-nuclear technique within 10-year launch lead-time. At the\nsame time, for a single CZ-5, the deflection distance of a 140 m diameter\nasteroid within 10-year launch lead-time, can be increased from less than 1\nEarth radii to more than 1 Earth radii.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 2020 14:58:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-07"}

This stochastic control\nproblem under partial information is solved by means of stochastic filtering,\ncontrol and PDMPs theory. The value function is characterized as the unique\ncontinuous viscosity solution of its dynamic programming equation and\nnumerically compared with its full information counterpart. The optimal full\ninformation spreads are shown to be biased when the exact market regime is\nunknown, as the market maker needs to adjust for additional regime uncertainty\nin terms of PnL sensitivity and observable order flow volatility.\n  The second part deals with numerically solving nonzero-sum stochastic impulse\ncontrol games.

One of the consequences of\nthis policy is a significant change in electricity consumption patterns. Since\nload forecasting models rely on calendar or meteorological information and are\ntrained on historical data, they fail to capture the significant break caused\nby the lockdown and have exhibited poor performances since the beginning of the\npandemic. This makes the scheduling of the electricity production challenging,\nand has a high cost for both electricity producers and grid operators. In this\npaper we introduce adaptive generalized additive models using Kalman filters\nand fine-tuning to adjust to new electricity consumption patterns.\nAdditionally, knowledge from the lockdown in Italy is transferred to anticipate\nthe change of behavior in France. The proposed methods are applied to forecast\nthe electricity demand during the French lockdown period, where they\ndemonstrate their ability to significantly reduce prediction errors compared to\ntraditional models. Finally expert aggregation is used to leverage the\nspecificities of each predictions and enhance results even further.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 2020 15:41:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-15"}

Exotic states\nof matter, such as Bose- Einstein condensates, superfluidity, chiral magnets,\nsuperconductivity, and liquid crystalline blue phases are observed in\nthermodynamic equilibrium. Rather than being a result of an aggregation of\nmatter, their emergence is due to a change of a topological state of the\nsystem. Here we investigate topological states of matter in a system with\ninjection and dissipation of energy. In an experiment involving a liquid\ncrystal cell under the influence of a low-frequency oscillatory electric field,\nwe observe a transition from non-vortex state to a state in which vortices\npersist. Depending on the period and the type of the forcing, the vortices\nself-organise forming square lattices, glassy states, and disordered vortex\nstructures. Based on a stochastic amplitude equation, we recognise the origin\nof the transition as the balance between stochastic creation and deterministic\nannihilation of vortices.

Specifically, we train two variational autoencoders (VAEs) to\nrespectively transform old photos and clean photos into two latent spaces. And\nthe translation between these two latent spaces is learned with synthetic\npaired data. This translation generalizes well to real photos because the\ndomain gap is closed in the compact latent space.

Two branches are fused in the latent space, leading to improved\ncapability to restore old photos from multiple defects.

Errors are routinely classified as statistical or\nsystematic. Although statistical errors are usually dealt with in the first\nyears of science studies, the typical approaches are based on manually\nperforming repetitive observations. Our work proposes a set of laboratory\nexperiments to teach error and uncertainties based on data recorded with the\nsensors available in many mobile devices. The main aspects addressed are the\nphysical meaning of the mean value and standard deviation, and the\ninterpretation of histograms and distributions. The normality of the\nfluctuations is analyzed qualitatively comparing histograms with normal curves\nand quantitatively comparing the number of observations in intervals to the\nnumber expected according to a normal distribution and also performing a\nChi-squared test. We show that the distribution usually follows a normal\ndistribution, however, when the sensor is placed on top of a loudspeaker\nplaying a pure tone significant differences with a normal distribution are\nobserved. As applications to every day situations we discuss the intensity of\nthe fluctuations in different situations, such as placing the device on a table\nor holding it with the hands in different ways. Other activities are focused on\nthe smoothness of a road quantified in terms of the fluctuations registered by\nthe accelerometer. The present proposal contributes to gaining a deep insight\ninto modern technologies and statistical errors and, finally, motivating and\nencouraging engineering and science students.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 2020 10:42:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-05"}

We focus on the magnetic reconnections at a magnetic null point\nthat participated in the X2.1 flare on 2011 September 6 around 22:21 UT\n(SOL2011-09-06T22:21X2.1) followed by the appearance of circular flare ribbons\nand coronal dimmings. The initial magnetic field from extrapolation displays a\nthree-dimensional (3D) null topology overlying a sheared arcade. Prior to the\nflare, magnetic loops rise due to the initial Lorentz force, and reconnect at\nthe 3D null, leading to expansion and loss of confined plasma that produce the\nobserved pre-flare coronal dimmings. Further, the simulated dynamics documents\nthe transfer of twist from the arcade to the overlying loops through\nreconnections, developing a flux rope. The non-parallel field lines comprising\nthe rope and lower-lying arcades form an X-type geometry. Importantly, the\nsimultaneous reconnections at the 3D null and the X-type geometry can explain\nthe observed circular and parallel flare ribbons. Reconnections at the 3D null\ntransform closed inner spine field lines into open field lines of the outer\nspine. The footpoints of these open field lines correspond to a ring-shaped\ncoronal dimming region, tracing the dome. Further, the flux rope bifurcates\nbecause of these reconnections which also results in the generation of open\nmagnetic field lines. The plasma loss along the open field lines can\npotentially explain the observed coronal dimming.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 2020 14:43:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-11"}
