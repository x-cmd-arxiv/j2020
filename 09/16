In particular,\nit is still unclear how these groups are linked and to what extent they are\nwell-mixed.\n  Aims: We investigate the similarities and differences in the properties\nbetween the prograde and retrograde (counter-rotating) stars and set those\nresults in context by using the properties of Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage,\nThamnos/Sequoia, and other suggested accreted populations.\n  Methods: We used the stellar metallicities of the major large spectroscopic\nsurveys (APOGEE, Gaia-ESO, GALAH, LAMOST, RAVE, SEGUE) in combination with\nastrometric and photometric data from Gaia's second data-release. We\ninvestigated the presence of radial and vertical metallicity gradients as well\nas the possible correlations between the azimuthal velocity, $v_\\phi,$ and\nmetallicity, [M/H], as qualitative indicators of the presence of mixed\npopulations.\n  Results: We find that a handful of super metal-rich stars exist on retrograde\norbits at various distances from the Galactic center and the Galactic plane. We\nalso find that the counter-rotating stars appear to be a well-mixed population,\nexhibiting radial and vertical metallicity gradients on the order of $\\sim$\n-0.04 dex/kpc and -0.06 dex/kpc, respectively, with little (if any) variation\nwhen different regions of the Galaxy are probed. The prograde stars show a\n$v_\\phi$-[M/H] relation that flattens -- and, perhaps, even reverses as a\nfunction of distance from the plane. Retrograde samples selected to roughly\nprobe Thamnos and Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage appear to be different populations yet\nthey also appear to be quite linked, as they follow the same trend in terms of\nthe eccentricity versus metallicity space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2020 16:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Sep 2020 21:03:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-11"}

Objectives: The objective of this work is to\nexperimentally validate a three-dimensional (3D) heat transfer model of the\nscala tympani which will enable accurate predictions of the maximum safe input\npower to avoid localized hyperthermia when detaching the magnet from the\nimplant electrode array.

Major challenges arise in the packaging of radio-frequency front-end\nmodules because of the stringent low signal-loss requirements in the\nmillimeter-wave frequency bands, and precision-impedance designs with smaller\nfootprints and thickness. Heterogeneous integration in 3D ultra-thin packages\nwith higher component densities and performance than with the existing 2D\npackages is needed to realize such 5G systems.

We find a substantial facet selectivity in the adsorption\nstructure and spatial distribution of the ions at the Au-NPs: while sodium and\nsome of the anions (e.g., Cl$^-$, HCF$^{3-}$) adsorb more at the `edgy' (100)\nand (110) facets of the NPs, where the water hydration structure is more\ndisordered, other ions (e.g., BF$_4$$^-$, PF$_6$$^-$, Nip$^-$) prefer to adsorb\nstrongly on the extended and rather flat (111) facets. In particular, Nip$^-$,\nwhich features an aromatic ring in its chemical structure, adsorbs strongly and\nperturbs the first water monolayer structure on the NP (111) facets\nsubstantially. Moreover, we calculate adsorptions, radially-resolved\nelectrostatic potentials, as well as the far-field effective electrostatic\nsurface charges and potentials by mapping the long-range decay of the\ncalculated electrostatic potential distribution onto the standard\nDebye-H\\\"uckel form.

When\nitem $i$ is inserted at time $t$, we gain a profit of $p_{it}$; however, this\nitem remains in the knapsack for all subsequent periods. The goal is to decide\nif and when to insert each item, subject to the time-dependent capacity\nconstraints, with the objective of maximizing our total profit. Interestingly,\nthis setting subsumes as special cases a number of recently-studied incremental\nknapsack problems, all known to be strongly NP-hard.\n  Our first contribution comes in the form of a polynomial-time\n$(\\frac{1}{2}-\\epsilon)$-approximation for the generalized incremental knapsack\nproblem.

Over\nthe last decade, radiative transfer simulations based on the Monte Carlo method\nhave underlined the role of the various stellar populations heating the diffuse\ndust. Beyond the expected heating through ongoing star formation, both older\nstellar population (> 8Gyr) and even AGN can contribute energy to the infrared\nemission of diffuse dust. Here, we examine how the radiation of an external\nheating source, like the less massive galaxy NGC5195, in the M51 interacting\nsystem, could affect the heating of the diffuse dust of its parent galaxy,\nNGC5194, and vice versa. To quantify the exchange of energy between the two\ngalaxies we use SKIRT, a state-of-the-art Monte Carlo radiative transfer code.\nIn the interest of modelling, the assumed centre-to-centre distance separation\nbetween the two galaxies is 10kpc. Our model reproduces the global SED of the\nsystem, and it closely matches the observed images. In total, 40.7% of the\nintrinsic stellar radiation of the combined system is absorbed by dust.\nFurthermore, we quantify the contribution of the various dust heating sources\nin the system, and find that the young stellar population of NGC5194 is the\npredominant dust-heating agent, with a global heating fraction of 71.2%.\nAnother 23% is provided by the older stellar population of the same galaxy,\nwhile the remaining 5.8% has its origin in NGC5195.

During the red giant phase, any close-orbiting planets will\nbe engulfed by the star, but more distant planets can survive this phase and\nremain in orbit around the white dwarf. Some white dwarfs show evidence for\nrocky material floating in their atmospheres, in warm debris disks, or orbiting\nvery closely, which has been interpreted as the debris of rocky planets that\nwere scattered inward and tidally disrupted. Recently, the discovery of a\ngaseous debris disk with a composition similar to ice giant planets\ndemonstrated that massive planets might also find their way into tight orbits\naround white dwarfs, but it is unclear whether the planets can survive the\njourney. So far, the detection of intact planets in close orbits around white\ndwarfs has remained elusive. Here, we report the discovery of a giant planet\ncandidate transiting the white dwarf WD 1856+534 (TIC 267574918) every 1.4\ndays. The planet candidate is roughly the same size as Jupiter and is no more\nthan 14 times as massive (with 95% confidence). Other cases of white dwarfs\nwith close brown dwarf or stellar companions are explained as the consequence\nof common-envelope evolution, wherein the original orbit is enveloped during\nthe red-giant phase and shrinks due to friction. In this case, though, the low\nmass and relatively long orbital period of the planet candidate make\ncommon-envelope evolution less likely. Instead, the WD 1856+534 system seems to\ndemonstrate that giant planets can be scattered into tight orbits without being\ntidally disrupted, and motivates searches for smaller transiting planets around\nwhite dwarfs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2020 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-17"}

This paper argues that intensity\ninterferometry can be understood as an extension of Fraunhofer diffraction to\nincoherent light. Interference patterns are still produced, but they are\nspeckle-like and transient, changing on a time scale of $1/\\Delta\\nu$ (where\n$\\Delta\\nu$ is the frequency bandwidth) known as the coherence time. Bright\nfringes average less than one photon per coherence time, hence fringes change\nbefore they can be observed. But very occasionally, two or even more photons\nmay be detected from an interference pattern within a coherence time. These\nrare coincident photons provide information about the underlying transient\ninterference pattern, and hence about the source brightness distribution.\nThinking in terms of transient sub-photon interference patterns makes it easy\nto see why intensity interferometry will have large optical-path tolerance, and\nbe immune to atmospheric seeing. The unusual signal-to-noise properties also\nbecome evident. We illustrate the unobservable but conceptually useful\ntransient interference patterns, and their observable correlation signal, with\nthree simulated examples: (i) an elongated source like Achernar, (ii) a\nthree-star system like Algol, and (iii) a crescent source that roughly mimics\nan exoplanet transit or perhaps the M87 black hole environment.

The first detailed studies were carried out for\nSU(5) GUT models where CP-violating decays of leptoquarks generate a baryon\nasymmetry. These GUT models were excluded by the discovery of B+L violating\nsphaleron processes at high temperatures. Yet a new possibility emerged,\nelectroweak baryogenesis. Here sphaleron processes generate a baryon asymmetry\nduring a strongly first-order phase transition. This mechanism has been studied\nin many extensions of the Standard Model. However, constraints from the LHC and\nfrom low-energy precision experiments exclude most of the known models, leaving\ncomposite Higgs models of electroweak symmetry breaking as an interesting\npossibility. Sphaleron processes are also the basis of leptogenesis, where\nCP-violating decays of heavy right-handed neutrinos generate a lepton asymmetry\nwhich is partially converted to a baryon asymmetry. This mechanism is closely\nrelated to the one of GUT baryogenesis, and simple estimates based on GUT\nmodels can explain the order of magnitude of the observed baryon-to-photon\nratio. In the one-flavour approximation an upper bound on the light neutrino\nmasses has been derived which is consistent with the cosmological upper bound\non the sum of neutrino masses. For quasi-degenerate right-handed neutrinos the\nleptogenesis temperature can be lowered from the GUT scale down to the weak\nscale, and CP-violating oscillations of GeV sterile neutinos can also lead to\nsuccessfull leptogenesis. Significant progress has been made in developing a\nfull field theoretical description of thermal leptogenesis, which demonstrated\nthat interactions with gauge bosons of the thermal plasma play a crucial role.\nFinally, we discuss recent ideas how the seesaw mechanism and B-L breaking at\nthe GUT scale can be probed by gravitational waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2020 18:00:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Apr 2021 19:46:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 7 Oct 2021 07:16:45 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2021 19:24:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-09"}

Towards the +50km/s Cloud, we observed the\nJ=2-1 rotational transitions of CS, C34S, 13CS, C33S, and 13C34S, and the J=3-2\ntransitions of CS and C34S with the IRAM-30m telescope, as well as the J=6-5\ntransitions of C34S and 13CS with the APEX 12m telescope, all in emission.

An\nimportant question in this line of research is to understand the optimal\ntrade-off between the query complexity of LDCs and their block length. Despite\nimportance of these objects, the best known constructions of constant query\nLDCs have super-polynomial length, and there is a significant gap between the\nbest constructions and the known lower bounds in terms of the block length.\n  For many applications it suffices to consider the weaker notion of relaxed\nLDCs (RLDCs), which allows the local decoding algorithm to abort if by querying\na few bits it detects that the input is not a codeword. This relaxation turned\nout to allow decoding algorithms with constant query complexity for codes with\nalmost linear length. Specifically, [BGH+06] constructed an $O(q)$-query RLDC\nthat encodes a message of length $k$ using a codeword of block length $n =\nO(k^{1+1/\\sqrt{q}})$.\n  In this work we improve the parameters of [BGH+06] by constructing an\n$O(q)$-query RLDC that encodes a message of length $k$ using a codeword of\nblock length $O(k^{1+1/{q}})$. This construction matches (up to a\nmultiplicative constant factor) the lower bounds of [KT00, Woo07] for constant\nquery LDCs, thus making progress toward understanding the gap between LDCs and\nRLDCs in the constant query regime.\n  In fact, our construction extends to the stronger notion of relaxed locally\ncorrectable codes (RLCCs), introduced in [GRR18], where given a noisy codeword\nthe correcting algorithm either recovers each individual bit of the codeword by\nonly reading a small part of the input, or aborts if the input is detected to\nbe corrupt.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2020 18:23:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-17"}

These processes are often hindered\nby the formation of blisters and loops, which are notoriously difficult to\nremove. Here we describe and explain a remarkable phenomenon that arises when\none attempts to remove a loop in a self-adherent sheet that is formed by, e.g.,\nfolding two adhesive sides of a tape together. One would expect the loop to\nsimply unloop when pulling on its free ends. Surprisingly, however, the loop\ndoes not immediately open up but shrinks in size, held together by a tenuous\ncontact region that propagates along the tape. This adhesive contact region\nonly ruptures once the loop is reduced to a critical size. We experimentally\nshow that the loop-shrinkage results from an interaction between the peeling\nfront and the loop, across the contact zone. This new type of interaction falls\noutside the realm of the classical elastica theory and is responsible for a\nhighly nonlinear increase in the peeling force. Our results reveal and quantify\nthe increased force required to remove loops in self-adherent media, which is\nof importance for blister removal and exfoliation of graphene sheets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2020 18:59:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Apr 2021 12:27:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-01"}

Emphasis is placed in the limit of strongly confined electrolytes, in\nwhich case local electroneutrality in the inter-surface space might not be\nfulfilled. In order to access the effects of such lack of local charge\nneutrality on the ionic-induced interactions between surfaces with modulated\ncharge domains, we consider two distinct model systems for the confined\nelectrolyte: one in which a salt reservoir is explicitly taken into account\n{\\it via} the osmotic equilibrium with an electrolyte of fixed bulk\nconcentration, and a second one in which the equilibrium with a charge neutral\nionic reservoir is implicitly considered.

A strong dependence of the\nionic-induced surface interactions in the employed model system is observed at\nall particle separations. These findings strongly suggest that due care is to\nbe taken while choosing among different scenarios to describe the ionic\nexchanging in electrolytes confined between charged surfaces, even in cases\nwhen the monopole (non zero net charge) surface contributions are absent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2020 19:00:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-29"}

This paper\naddresses this scope and proposes a novel solution. Most video captioning\nmodels comprise two sequential/recurrent layers - one as a video-to-context\nencoder and the other as a context-to-caption decoder. This paper proposes a\nnovel architecture, namely Semantically Sensible Video Captioning (SSVC) which\nmodifies the context generation mechanism by using two novel approaches -\n\"stacked attention\" and \"spatial hard pull\". As there are no exclusive metrics\nfor evaluating video captioning models, we emphasize both quantitative and\nqualitative analysis of our model. Hence, we have used the BLEU scoring metric\nfor quantitative analysis and have proposed a human evaluation metric for\nqualitative analysis, namely the Semantic Sensibility (SS) scoring metric.

In this paper, we propose a simple\ndata-free approach for combining weak supervision signals by defining a\nconstrained space for the possible labels of the weak signals and training with\na random labeling within this constrained space. Our method is efficient and\nstable, converging after a few iterations of gradient descent.

The\nsemi-structured answer has two advantages which are more readable and\nfalsifiable compared to span answer. There are two approaches to solve this\nproblem. One is an extractive method which extracts candidate answers from the\npassage with the Open IE model, and ranks them by matching with questions. It\nfully uses the passage information at the extraction step, but the extraction\nis independent to the question. The other one is the generative method which\nuses a sequence to sequence model to generate answers directly. It combines the\nquestion and passage as input at the same time, but it generates the answer\nfrom scratch, which does not use the facts that most of the answer words come\nfrom in the passage.

To identify the true\nanomalies, in practice, analysts or domain experts will be employed to\ninvestigate the top instances one by one in a ranked list of anomalies\nidentified by an anomaly detection system. This verification procedure\ngenerates informative labels that can be leveraged to re-rank the anomalies so\nas to help the analyst to discover more true anomalies given a time budget.\nSome re-ranking strategies have been proposed to approximate the above\nsequential decision process. Specifically, existing strategies have been\nfocused on making the top instances more likely to be anomalous based on the\nfeedback. Then they greedily select the top-1 instance for query. However,\nthese greedy strategies could be sub-optimal since some low-ranked instances\ncould be more helpful in the long-term. In this work, we propose Active Anomaly\nDetection with Meta-Policy (Meta-AAD), a novel framework that learns a\nmeta-policy for query selection. Specifically, Meta-AAD leverages deep\nreinforcement learning to train the meta-policy to select the most proper\ninstance to explicitly optimize the number of discovered anomalies throughout\nthe querying process. Meta-AAD is easy to deploy since a trained meta-policy\ncan be directly applied to any new datasets without further tuning. Extensive\nexperiments on 24 benchmark datasets demonstrate that Meta-AAD significantly\noutperforms the state-of-the-art re-ranking strategies and the unsupervised\nbaseline.

In the present comprehensive paper, we\ndiscuss in detail the various special features of the reported nondegenerate\nvector solitons. To bring out these details, we derive the exact forms of such\nvector one-, two- and three-soliton solutions through Hirota bilinear method\nand they are rewritten in more compact forms using Gram determinants. The\npresence of distinct wave numbers allows the nondegenerate fundamental soliton\nto admit various profiles such as double-hump, flat-top and single-hump\nstructures. We explain the formation of double-hump structure in the\nfundamental soliton when the relative velocity of the two modes tends to zero.\nMore critical analysis shows that the nondegenerate fundamental solitons can\nundergo shape preserving as well as shape altering collisions under appropriate\nconditions. The shape changing collision occurs between the modes of\nnondegenerate solitons when the parameters are fixed suitably. Then we observe\nthe coexistence of degenerate and nondegenerate solitons when the wave numbers\nare restricted appropriately in the obtained two-soliton solution.

The introduced intrinsic covariance function links\nestimation of covariance structure to smoothing problems that involve raw\ncovariance observations derived from sparsely observed Riemannian functional\ndata, while the covariance vector bundle provides a rigorous mathematical\nfoundation for formulating such smoothing problems. The parallel transport and\nthe bundle metric together make it possible to measure fidelity of fit to the\ncovariance function.

However, to date, the intrinsic Q of\nintegrated all-waveguide resonators has been relegated to below 150 Million.\nHere, we report an all-waveguide Si3N4 resonator with an intrinsic Q of 422\nMillion and a 3.4 Billion absorption loss limited Q. The resonator has a 453\nkHz intrinsic linewidth and 906 kHz loaded linewidth, with a finesse of 3005.\nThe corresponding linear loss of 0.060 dB/m is the lowest reported to date for\nan all-waveguide design with deposited upper cladding oxide. These are the\nhighest intrinsic and absorption loss limited Q factors and lowest linewidth\nreported to date for a photonic integrated all-waveguide resonator.

JTB could provide precise guidance\nand considerable convenience for both talent recruitment and job seekers for\nposition and salary calibration/prediction. Traditional JTB approaches mainly\nrely on manual market surveys, which is expensive and labor-intensive.\nRecently, the rapid development of Online Professional Graph has accumulated a\nlarge number of talent career records, which provides a promising trend for\ndata-driven solutions. However, it is still a challenging task since (1) the\njob title and job transition (job-hopping) data is messy which contains a lot\nof subjective and non-standard naming conventions for the same position (e.g.,\nProgrammer, Software Development Engineer, SDE, Implementation Engineer), (2)\nthere is a large amount of missing title/transition information, and (3) one\ntalent only seeks limited numbers of jobs which brings the incompleteness and\nrandomness modeling job transition patterns. To overcome these challenges, we\naggregate all the records to construct a large-scale Job Title Benchmarking\nGraph (Job-Graph), where nodes denote job titles affiliated with specific\ncompanies and links denote the correlations between jobs.

We fuse the multi-view representations in the\nencode-decode paradigm to obtain a unified optimal representation for the task\nof link prediction.

Though many ZSL methods\nrely on a direct mapping between the visual and the semantic space, the\ncalibration deviation and hubness problem limit the generalization capability\nto unseen classes. Recently emerged generative ZSL methods generate unseen\nimage features to transform ZSL into a supervised classification problem.\nHowever, most generative models still suffer from the seen-unseen bias problem\nas only seen data is used for training. To address these issues, we propose a\nnovel bidirectional embedding based generative model with a tight\nvisual-semantic coupling constraint.

This paper presents\nPL-VINS, a real-time optimization-based monocular VINS method with point and\nline features, developed based on the state-of-the-art point-based VINS-Mono\n\\cite{vins}. We observe that current works use the LSD \\cite{lsd} algorithm to\nextract line features; however, LSD is designed for scene shape representation\ninstead of the pose estimation problem, which becomes the bottleneck for the\nreal-time performance due to its high computational cost. In this paper, a\nmodified LSD algorithm is presented by studying a hidden parameter tuning and\nlength rejection strategy. The modified LSD can run at least three times as\nfast as LSD. Further, by representing space lines with the Pl\\\"{u}cker\ncoordinates, the residual error in line estimation is modeled in terms of the\npoint-to-line distance, which is then minimized by iteratively updating the\nminimum four-parameter orthonormal representation of the Pl\\\"{u}cker\ncoordinates.

This\ncreates a significant social problem for everyone whose photos are publicly\navailable on the Internet, especially on social media websites. Several deep\nlearning-based detection methods have been developed to identify these\ndeepfakes.

It\nconsists of three factors, the factor system for the translation subgroup $L$,\nan in-homogeneous factor system for the point group $P$, and a factor\nconnecting $L$ and $P$. The three factors satisfy three consistency equations,\nwhich are exactly solvable and can completely exhaust all factor systems for\nspace groups. Second, since factors systems are classified by the second\ncohomology group, we show the (co)homology groups for space groups can be\nderived from Borel's equivariant (co)homology theory, which leads to an\nalgorithm that can compute all (co)homology groups for space groups.

However, the distillation\nand fusion operations are usually performed at either frame level or instance\nlevel with external guidance using additional information, such as optical flow\nand feature memory.

Our contribution is fivefold.\nFirst, we propose a unified approach for solving this class of group\nsynchronization problems, which consists of a suitable initialization step and\nan iterative refinement step based on the generalized power method, and show\nthat it enjoys a strong theoretical guarantee on the estimation error under\ncertain assumptions on the group, measurement graph, noise, and initialization.\nSecond, we formulate two geometric conditions that are required by our approach\nand show that they hold for various practically relevant subgroups of the\northogonal group. The conditions are closely related to the error-bound\ngeometry of the subgroup -- an important notion in optimization. Third, we\nverify the assumptions on the measurement graph and noise for standard random\ngraph and random matrix models. Fourth, based on the classic notion of metric\nentropy, we develop and analyze a novel spectral-type estimator. Finally, we\nshow via extensive numerical experiments that our proposed non-convex approach\noutperforms existing approaches in terms of computational speed, scalability,\nand/or estimation error.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Sep 2020 07:25:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 May 2022 10:02:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-23"}

The relative importance of AC and DC heating in maintaining the\ntemperature of the corona is not well constrained. Aims. Investigate the\neffects of the characteristic time scales of photospheric driving on the\ninjection and dissipation of energy within a coronal arcade. Methods. We have\nconducted three dimensional MHD simulations of foot point driving imposed on an\narcade. We modified the typical driving time scales to understand the\nefficiency of heating obtained using AC and DC drivers. We considered the\nimplications for the injected Poynting flux and the nature of the energy\nrelease in dissipative regimes. Results. For the same driver amplitude and\ncomplexity, long time scale motions are able to inject a much greater Poynting\nflux into the corona. Consequently, in non-ideal regimes, slow stressing\nmotions result in a greater increase in plasma temperature than for wave-like\ndriving. In dissipative simulations, Ohmic heating is found to be much more\nsignificant than viscous heating. For all drivers in our parameter space,\nenergy dissipation is greatest close to the base of the arcade where the\nmagnetic field strength is strongest and at separatrix surfaces, where the\nfield connectivity changes. Across all simulations, the background field is\nstressed with random foot point motions (in a manner typical of DC heating\nstudies) and even for short time scale driving, the injected Poynting flux is\nlarge given the small amplitude flows considered. For long time scale driving,\nthe rate of energy injection was comparable to the expected requirements in\nactive regions. The heating rates were found to scale with the perturbed\nmagnetic field strength and not the total field strength. Conclusions.\nAlongside recent studies which show power within the corona is dominated by low\nfrequency motions, our results suggest that in the closed corona, DC heating is\nmore significant than AC heating.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Sep 2020 08:11:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-11"}

A\nknown channel of harmful manipulations is precise control over the observed\nassignment, but this channel is only an example. This study uncovers the only\nother channel: sample selection by deciding manipulation precisely based on the\ngiven assignment status. For example, in the assignment design of a\nqualification exam, self-selection by allowing test retakes precisely based on\nfailing the exam is a precise decision. This precise decision harms\nidentification without precisely controlling the final assignment. For\ninstance, retaking the test never ensures passage, but it distorts the\nqualification assignment because some students that failed then pass. However,\nstudents that have already passed, never fail. This novel channel redefines the\njustification for identification. Furthermore, under a new auxiliary condition,\nMcCrary (2008)'s test is able to confirm identification and the existing\nworst-case bounds are nested within our new bounds.

In this\npaper, we study Thompson Sampling based algorithm for Unsupervised Sequential\nSelection (USS) problem. The USS problem is a variant of the stochastic\nmulti-armed bandits problem, where the loss of an arm can not be inferred from\nthe observed feedback. In the USS setup, arms are associated with fixed costs\nand are ordered, forming a cascade. In each round, the learner selects an arm\nand observes the feedback from arms up to the selected arm. The learner's goal\nis to find the arm that minimizes the expected total loss. The total loss is\nthe sum of the cost incurred for selecting the arm and the stochastic loss\nassociated with the selected arm. The problem is challenging because, without\nknowing the mean loss, one cannot compute the total loss for the selected arm.\nClearly, learning is feasible only if the optimal arm can be inferred from the\nproblem structure. As shown in the prior work, learning is possible when the\nproblem instance satisfies the so-called `Weak Dominance' (WD) property. Under\nWD, we show that our Thompson Sampling based algorithm for the USS problem\nachieves near optimal regret and has better numerical performance than existing\nalgorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Sep 2020 08:48:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-17"}

Among others,\nsurveillance radars which are constantly scanning a region of interest in the\nsky are used for this purpose. The detections from such a radar which cannot be\nassigned to an already known catalogue object might not contain enough\ninformation to obtain a reliable initial orbit for a new catalogue entry from a\nsingle measured pass, also called tracklet. Instead, two tracklets can be\ncombined to improve the quality of the initial orbit which leads to the\ncorrelation problem. This means that it has to be tested whether two tracklets\nbelong to the same object and an initial orbit has to be derived by combining\nthe tracklets. A common approach to condense the information in the tracklet is\nfitting them with so-called attributables. Because radar observations include\ndifferent types of observables, the fitting of these attributables has to be\nconsidered as an important part of the entire correlation process. This paper\nanalyses the effect of the attributable fitting considering the achieved\naccuracy and influence on the tracklet correlation. A new singularity-free\ncoordinate system is introduced, which improves the results of the fitting and\ncorrelation.

Here we\nstudy the evolution of Dirac fermions, in particular the cubic Dirac crossing,\nunder external pressure in the representative quasi-one-dimensional\nTl$_2$Mo$_6$Se$_6$ via the first-principles calculations. Specifically, it is\nfound that the topological properties, including the bulk Dirac crossings and\nthe topological surface states, change progressively under pressure up to 50\nGPa where it undergoes a structural transition from the hexagonal phase to\nbody-centered tetragonal phase. Above 50 GPa, the system is more likely to be\ntopologically trivial. Further, we also investigate its phonon spectra, which\nreveals a gradual depletion of the negative phonon modes with pressure,\nconsistent with the more three-dimensional Fermi surface in the high-pressure\nphase. Our work may provide a useful guideline for further experimental search\nand the band engineering of the topologically nontrivial fermions in this\nintriguing state of matter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Sep 2020 09:29:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-17"}

Protoplanetary disks are known to host spiral features that are\nobserved in scattered light, ALMA continuum and more recently in CO gas\nemission and gas dynamics. It is however unknown if spirals in gas and dust\ntrace the same morphology.\n  Aims. We study the morphology and amplitude of dusty spirals as function of\nStokes number and the underlying mechanisms causing a difference from gas\nspirals. We then construct a model to relate the deviation from Keplerian\nrotation in the gas to a perturbation in surface density of gas and dust.\n  Methods. We use FARGO-3D with dust implementation to numerically study the\nspirals, after which the results are interpreted using a semi-analytical model.\nThis model is tested on observational data to predict the perturbation of the\nspiral in gas dynamics based on the continuum data.\n  Results. We find that the pitch angle of a spiral does not differ\nsignificantly between gas and dust. The amplitude of the dust spiral decreases\nwith Stokes number (St) and starts to fade out at a typical St > 0.1 as the\ndust becomes decoupled from the gas. The semianalytical model provides an\naccurate and fast representation of the spiral in surface density of the dust\nfrom the gas. We find a spiral in the TW Hya velocity residual map, never seen\nbefore, which is a feature in the vertical velocity and has a kink at the\ncontinuum gap, yielding strong evidence for a planet at 99 au.\n  Conclusions. We built a model that gives an estimate of the underlying\ndynamics of dust in a spiral, which can serve as a proof of planetary origin of\nspirals and can be a probe for the Stokes number in the disk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Sep 2020 09:43:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-11"}

This also means there is a need\nfor objective quality criteria, and automated methods to optimise parameter\nsettings for these software tools.\n  We present a comparison of several tools which have been developed to perform\nthis task: namely SExtractor, ProFound, NoiseChisel, and MTObjects. In\nparticular, we focus on evaluating performance in situations which present\nchallenges for detection -- for example, faint and diffuse galaxies; extended\nstructures, such as streams; and objects close to bright sources. Furthermore,\nwe develop an automated method to optimise the parameters for the above tools.\n  We present four different objective segmentation quality measures, based on\nprecision, recall, and a new measure for the correctly identified area of\nsources. Bayesian optimisation is used to find optimal parameter settings for\neach of the four tools on simulated data, for which a ground truth is known.\nAfter training, the tools are tested on similar simulated data, to provide a\nperformance baseline. We then qualitatively assess tool performance on real\nastronomical images from two different surveys.\n  We determine that when area is disregarded, all four tools are capable of\nbroadly similar levels of detection completeness, while only NoiseChisel and\nMTObjects are capable of locating the faint outskirts of objects. MTObjects\nproduces the highest scores on all tests on all four quality measures, whilst\nSExtractor obtains the highest speeds. No tool has sufficient speed and\naccuracy to be well-suited to large-scale automated segmentation in its current\nform.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Sep 2020 10:20:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 20:00:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}

The rotational\nspectrum of thioformamide was measured and analyzed in the frequency range 150\nto 660 GHz using the Lille spectrometer.

There are many classical\napproaches to image reconstruction, but ameliorating the effects of incomplete\nor imperfect data through the incorporation of accurate priors is challenging\nand leads to slow algorithms.

Reliable ELM pacing\nhas been demonstrated experimentally in several devices increasing the ELM\nfrequency considerably. However, it was also shown that the frequency cannot be\nincreased arbitrarily due to a so-called lag-time. During this time after a\npreceding natural or triggered ELM crash, neither a natural ELM crash occurs\nnor the triggering of an ELM crash by pellet injection is possible. For this\narticle, pellet ELM triggering simulations are advanced beyond previous studies\nin two ways. Firstly, realistic ExB and diamagnetic background flows are\nincluded. And secondly, the pellet is injected at different stages of the\npedestal build-up. This allows to recover the lag-time for the first time in\nsimulations and investigate it in detail. A series of non-linear extended MHD\nsimulations is performed to investigate the plasma dynamics resulting from an\ninjection at different time points during the pedestal build-up. The\nexperimentally observed lag-time is qualitatively reproduced well. In\nparticular, a sharp transition is observed between the regime where no ELMs can\nbe triggered and the regime where pellet injection causes an ELM crash. Via\nvariations of pellet parameters and injection time, the two regimes are studied\nand compared in detail revealing pronounced differences in the non-linear\ndynamics.

In the first long-term study of how the new length\nlimit was adopted by Twitter users, we ask: Does the effect of the new length\nlimit resemble that of the old one? Or did the doubling of the limit\nfundamentally change how Twitter is shaped by the limited length of posted\ncontent? By analyzing Twitter's publicly available 1% sample over a period of\naround 3 years, we find that, when the length limit was raised from 140 to 280\ncharacters, the prevalence of tweets around 140 characters dropped immediately,\nwhile the prevalence of tweets around 280 characters rose steadily for about 6\nmonths. Despite this rise, tweets approaching the length limit have been far\nless frequent after than before the switch. We find widely different adoption\nrates across languages and client-device types. The prevalence of tweets around\n140 characters before the switch in a given language is strongly correlated\nwith the prevalence of tweets around 280 characters after the switch in the\nsame language, and very long tweets are vastly more popular on Web clients than\non mobile clients. Moreover, tweets of around 280 characters after the switch\nare syntactically and semantically similar to tweets of around 140 characters\nbefore the switch, manifesting patterns of message squeezing in both cases.\nTaken together, these findings suggest that the new 280-character limit\nconstitutes a new, less intrusive version of the old 140-character limit. The\nlength limit remains an important factor that should be considered in all\nstudies using Twitter data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Sep 2020 13:01:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-17"}

The volume-averaged $Nu_{\\text{vol}}$\nand the kinetic energy dissipation based $Nu_{\\text{kinetic}}$ can better\nreproduce the correlation of internal flow structures with heat transfer\nefficiency than that of the wall-averaged $Nu_{\\text{wall}}$ and the thermal\nenergy dissipation based $Nu_{\\text{thermal}}$, even though these four Nusselt\nnumbers give consistent time-averaged mean values. The ensemble-averaged time\ntrace of $Nu$ during flow reversal shows that only the volume-averaged\n$Nu_{\\text{vol}}$ can reproduce the overshoot phenomena that is observed in the\nprevious experimental study. Our results reveal that the proper choice of $Nu$\nis critical to obtain a meaningful interpretation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Sep 2020 13:34:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Oct 2020 12:30:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-09"}

We modified the Hindmarsh-Rose model and obtained a system with two\ndynamical variables x(t), y(t), where the first one represents the X-ray flux\nfrom the source, and an input function J(t), whose mean level J_0 and its time\nevolution is responsible of the variability class. We found that for values of\nJ_0 around the boundary between the unstable and the stable interval, where the\nequilibrium points are of spiral type, one obtain an oscillating behaviour in\nthe model light curve similar to the observed ones with a broad Lorentzian\nfeature in the power density spectrum and, occasionally, with one or two\nharmonics. Rapid fluctuations of J(t), as those originating from turbulence,\nstabilize the low-frequency quasi periodic oscillations resulting in a slowly\namplitude modulated pattern.To validate the model we compared the results with\nreal RXTE data which resulted remarkably similar to those obtained from the\nmathematical model. Our results allow us to favour an intrinsic hypothesis on\nthe origin of LFQPOs in accretion discs ultimately related to the same\nmechanism responsible for the spiking limit cycle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Sep 2020 13:55:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-17"}

We study the evolution of rotation and high energy X-ray, extreme\nultraviolet (EUV), and Ly-alpha emission for F, G, K, and M dwarfs, with masses\nbetween 0.1 and 1.2 Msun, and provide our evolutionary code and a freely\navailable set of evolutionary tracks for use in planetary atmosphere studies.\n  Methods. We develop a physical rotational evolution model constrained by\nobserved rotation distributions in young stellar clusters. Using rotation,\nX-ray, EUV, and Ly-alpha measurements, we derive empirical relations for the\ndependences of high energy emission on stellar parameters. Our description of\nX-ray evolution is validated using measurements of X-ray distributions in young\nclusters.\n  Results. A star's X-ray, EUV, and Ly-alpha evolution is determined by its\nmass and initial rotation rate, with initial rotation being less important for\nlower mass stars. At all ages, solar mass stars are significantly more X-ray\nluminous than lower mass stars and stars that are born as rapid rotators remain\nhighly active longer than those born as slow rotators. At all evolutionary\nstages, habitable zone planets receive higher X-ray and EUV fluxes when\norbiting lower mass stars due to their longer evolutionary timescales. The\nrates of flares follow similar evolutionary trends with higher mass stars\nflaring more often than lower mass stars at all ages, though habitable zone\nplanets are likely influenced by flares more when orbiting lower mass stars.\n  Conclusions. Our results show that single decay-laws are insufficient to\ndescribe stellar activity evolution and highlight the need for a more\ncomprehensive description based on the evolution of rotation, including also\nthe effects of short-term variability. Planets at similar orbital distances\nfrom their host stars receive significantly more X-ray and EUV energy over\ntheir lifetimes when orbiting higher mass stars.

In this\nregard, the interaction between the methane molecule and its enclosing\ndodecahedral water cage, CH$_4$(H$_2$O)$_{20}$, is a stringent test for\napproximate methods, including density-functional theory (DFT) approximations.\nHybrid and semilocal DFT approximations behave erratically for this system,\nwith three- and four-body nonadditive terms having neither the correct sign nor\nmagnitude. Here we analyze to what extent these qualitative errors in different\nMBE contributions are conveyed to post-Kohn-Sham random-phase approximation\n(RPA). The results reveal a correlation between the quality of the DFT input\nstates and the RPA results. Moreover, the renormalized singles energy (RSE)\ncorrections play a crucial role in all orders of MBE. For dimers, RSE corrects\nthe RPA underbinding for every tested Kohn-Sham model: generalized-gradient\napproximation (GGA), meta-GGA, (meta-)GGA hybrids, as well as the optimized\neffective potential at the correlated level. Remarkably, the inclusion of\nsingles in RPA can also correct the wrong signs of three- and four-body\nnonadditive energies as well as mitigate the excessive higher-order\ncontributions to the MBE. The RPA errors are dominated by the contributions of\ncompact clusters. As a workable method for large systems, we propose to replace\nthose compact contributions with CCSD(T) energies and to sum up the remaining\nmany-body contributions up to infinity with supermolecular or periodic RPA. As\na demonstration of this approach, we show that for RPA(PBE0)+RSE it suffices to\napply CCSD(T) to dimers and 30 compact, hydrogen-bonded trimers to get the\nmethane-water cage interaction energy to within 1.6% of the reference value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Sep 2020 14:17:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2021 15:23:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-14"}

Using the new X-ray luminosity function derived from these data, we here\nestimate the accretion efficiency of SMBHs and their contribution to\nreionization. We calculate the total ionizing radiation from active galactic\nnuclei (AGN) as a function of redshift, based on the X radiation and\ndistribution of obscuring column density, converted to UV wavelengths. Limiting\nthe luminosity function to unobscured AGN only, our results agree with current\nUV luminosity functions of unobscured AGN. For realistic assumptions about the\nescape fraction, the contribution of all AGN to cosmic reionization is $\\sim4$\ntimes lower than the galaxy contribution (23% at $z\\sim6$). Our results also\noffer an observationally constrained prescription that can be used in\nsimulations or models of galaxy evolution. To estimate the average efficiency\nwith which supermassive black holes convert mass to light, we compare the total\nradiated energy, converted from X-ray light using a bolometric correction, to\nthe most recent local black hole mass density. The most likely value, $\\eta\n\\sim 0.3-0.34$, approaches the theoretical limit for a maximally rotating Kerr\nblack hole, $\\eta=0.42$, implying that on average growing supermassive black\nholes are spinning rapidly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Sep 2020 14:34:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-11"}

First,\neach student is established by randomly routing on a modular neural network,\nwhich facilitates flexible knowledge communication between students due to\nrandom levels of representation sharing and branching. Second, to resist the\nstudent homogenization, students first compose diverse feature sets by\nexploiting the inductive bias from sub-sets of training data, and then\naggregate and distill different complementary knowledge by imitating a random\nsub-group of students at each time step. Overall, the above mechanisms are\nbeneficial for maximizing the student population to further improve the model\ngeneralization without sacrificing computational efficiency.

The KR field energy density is found to\ndecrease with the expansion of our universe at a faster rate in comparison to\nradiation and matter components. Thus as the Universe evolves and cools down,\nthe contribution of the KR field on the evolutionary process reduces\nsignificantly, and at present it almost does not affect the universe evolution.\nHowever the KR field has a significant contribution during early universe, in\nparticular, it affects the beginning of inflation as well as increases the\namount of primordial gravitational radiation and hence enlarges the value of\ntensor to scalar ratio in respect to the case when the KR field is absent. In\nregard to the KR field couplings, it turns out that in four dimensional higher\ncurvature inflationary model the couplings of the KR field to other matter\nfields is given by $1/M_{Pl}$ i.e same as the usual gravity-matter coupling.\nHowever in higher dimensional higher curvature model the KR couplings get an\nadditional suppression over $1/M_{Pl}$ and thus gives a better explanation of\nwhy the present universe carries practically no footprint of the Kalb-Ramond\nfield in comparison to the 4D higher curvature model. The higher curvature term\nin 5D action acts as a suitable stabilizing agent in the dynamical\nstabilization mechanism of the extra dimensional modulus field from the\nperspective of effective on-brane theory.

Given a class, CIG takes the name of this class as\ninput and generates a set of images that belong to this class. In existing CIG\nworks, for different classes, their corresponding images are generated\nindependently, without considering the relationship among classes. In\nreal-world applications, the classes are organized into a hierarchy and their\nhierarchical relationships are informative for generating high-fidelity images.\nIn this paper, we aim to leverage the class hierarchy for conditional image\ngeneration. We propose two ways of incorporating class hierarchy: prior control\nand post constraint. In prior control, we first encode the class hierarchy,\nthen feed it as a prior into the conditional generator to generate images. In\npost constraint, after the images are generated, we measure their consistency\nwith the class hierarchy and use the consistency score to guide the training of\nthe generator. Based on these two ideas, we propose a TreeGAN model which\nconsists of three modules: (1) a class hierarchy encoder (CHE) which takes the\nhierarchical structure of classes and their textual names as inputs and learns\nan embedding for each class; the embedding captures the hierarchical\nrelationship among classes; (2) a conditional image generator (CIG) which takes\nthe CHE-generated embedding of a class as input and generates a set of images\nbelonging to this class; (3) a consistency checker which performs hierarchical\nclassification on the generated images and checks whether the generated images\nare compatible with the class hierarchy; the consistency score is used to guide\nthe CIG to generate hierarchy-compatible images.

We show, using a\nphotochemical model, that high abiotic CH4 abundances produced by volcanoes\nwould be accompanied by high CO abundances, which could be a detectable false\npositive diagnostic. Overall, when considering known mechanisms for generating\nabiotic CH4 on terrestrial planets, we conclude that observations of\natmospheric CH4 with CO2 are difficult to explain without the presence of\nbiology when the CH4 abundance implies a surface flux comparable to modern\nEarth's biological CH4 flux. A small or negligible CO abundance strengthens the\nCH4+CO2 biosignature because life readily consumes atmospheric CO, while\nreducing volcanic gases likely cause CO to build up in a planet's atmosphere.\nFurthermore, the difficulty of volcanically-generated CH4-rich atmospheres\nsuitable for an origin of life may favor alternatives such as impact-induced\nreducing atmospheres.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Sep 2020 15:45:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2020 18:45:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-03"}

For a property P, the goal is to distinguish\ninputs that have P from those that are far from having P with high probability\ncorrectly, by querying only a small number of local parts of the input. In\nproperty testing on graphs, the distance is measured by the number of edge\nmodifications (additions or deletions), that are necessary to transform a graph\ninto one with property P. Much research has focussed on the query complexity of\nsuch algorithms, i. e. the number of queries the algorithm makes to the input,\nbut in view of applications, the running time of the algorithm is equally\nrelevant.\n  In (Adler, Harwath STACS 2018), a natural extension of the bounded degree\ngraph model of property testing to relational databases of bounded degree was\nintroduced, and it was shown that on databases of bounded degree and bounded\ntree-width, every property that is expressible in monadic second-order logic\nwith counting (CMSO) is testable with constant query complexity and sublinear\nrunning time. It remains open whether this can be improved to constant running\ntime.\n  In this paper we introduce a new model, which is based on the bounded degree\nmodel, but the distance measure allows both edge (tuple) modifications and\nvertex (element) modifications. Our main theorem shows that on databases of\nbounded degree and bounded tree-width, every property that is expressible in\nCMSO is testable with constant query complexity and constant running time in\nthe new model. We also show that every property that is testable in the\nclassical model is testable in our model with the same query complexity and\nrunning time, but the converse is not true.\n  We argue that our model is natural and our meta-theorem showing constant-time\nCMSO testability supports this.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Sep 2020 15:55:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-17"}

The notion of the robopsychology as a fictional\nscience and a fictional occupation was introduced by Asimov in the middle of\nthe last century. The robophilosophy, on the other hand, is only a few years\nold today.

Instead, they focus only on issues that, although are extremely\nimportant, play a complementary role, such as moral or ethical ones, rather\nthan the big questions of life. We try to outline a conception in which the\nrobophilosophy and robopsychology will be able to play a similar leading rule\nin the progress of artificial intelligence than the philosophy and psychology\nhave done in the progress of human intelligence. To facilitate this, we outline\nthe idea of a visual artificial language and interactive theorem prover-based\ncomputer application called Prime Convo Assistant. The question to be decided\nin the future is whether we can develop such an application. And if so, can we\nbuild a computer game on it, or even an esport game?

Different approaches\nof applying supervised learning to represent unclosed terms, model\ndiscrepancies and sub-filter scales are discussed in the context of RANS and\nLES modeling. Particular emphasis is placed on the impact of the training\nprocedure on the consistency of ML augmentations with the underlying physical\nmodel. Techniques to promote model-consistent training, and to avoid the\nrequirement of full fields of direct numerical simulation data are detailed.\nThis is followed by a discussion of physics-informed and mathematical\nconsiderations on the choice of the feature space, and imposition of\nconstraints on the ML model. With a view towards developing generalizable\nML-augmented RANS and LES models, outstanding challenges are discussed, and\nperspectives are provided. While the promise of ML-augmented turbulence\nmodeling is clear, and successes have been demonstrated in isolated scenarios,\na general consensus of this paper is that truly generalizable models require\nmodel-consistent training with careful characterization of underlying\nassumptions and imposition of physically and mathematically informed priors and\nconstraints to account for the inevitable shortage of data relevant to\npredictions of interest.

The next-fidelity model types are\nReynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) which are two orders of magnitude\ncheaper, but resolve only mean quantities and model the effect of turbulence.\nThey often fail to accurately predict key effects, such as the wake recovery\nrate. Custom RANS closures designed for wind-farm wakes exist, but so far do\nnot generalize well: there is substantial room for improvement. In this article\nwe present the first steps towards a systematic data-driven approach to\nderiving new RANS models in the wind-energy setting. Time-averaged LES data is\nused as ground-truth, and we first derive optimal corrective fields for the\nturbulence anisotropy tensor and turbulence kinetic energy (t.k.e.) production.\nThese fields, when injected into the RANS equations (with a baseline\n$k-\\epsilon$ model) reproduce the LES mean-quantities. Next we build a custom\nRANS closure from these corrective fields, using a deterministic symbolic\nregression method to infer algebraic correction as a function of the (resolved)\nmean-flow. The result is a new RANS closure, customized to the training data.\nThe potential of the approach is demonstrated under neutral atmospheric\nconditions for multi-turbine constellations at wind-tunnel scale.
