Paying careful attention to the influence of the parameter priors and\nthe quality of the model fits, we show that the evidence ratios can be\nunderstood by comparing the predicted chirp mass distribution to that of the\ndata. We identify the posterior predictive distribution of chirp mass as a\nvital tool for discriminating between models. A model in which all mergers are\nPBH binaries is strongly disfavoured compared with astrophysical models, in\npart due to the over-prediction of heavy systems having $\\mathcal{M}_{{\\rm\nchirp}} \\gtrsim 40 \\, M_\\odot$ and positive skewness over the range of observed\nmasses which does not match the observations.

Nevertheless, most practical methods still\nrequire all training videos to be labeled with temporal annotations (action\ncategory and temporal boundary) and develop the models in a fully-supervised\nmanner, despite expensive labeling efforts and inapplicable to new categories.\nIn this paper, we introduce a new design of transfer learning type to learn\naction localization for a large set of action categories, but only on action\nmoments from the categories of interest and temporal annotations of untrimmed\nvideos from a small set of action classes. Specifically, we present Action\nHerald Networks (AherNet) that integrate such design into an one-stage action\nlocalization framework. Technically, a weight transfer function is uniquely\ndevised to build the transformation between classification of action moments or\nforeground video segments and action localization in synthetic contextual\nmoments or untrimmed videos.

The most\nchallenging setting requires a constant complexity of the deep model and an\nincremental model update without access to a bounded memory of past data. Then,\nthe representations of past classes are strongly affected by catastrophic\nforgetting. To mitigate its negative effect, an adapted fine tuning which\nincludes knowledge distillation is usually deployed. We propose a different\napproach based on a vanilla fine tuning backbone. It leverages initial\nclassifier weights which provide a strong representation of past classes\nbecause they are trained with all class data. However, the magnitude of\nclassifiers learned in different states varies and normalization is needed for\na fair handling of all classes. Normalization is performed by standardizing the\ninitial classifier weights, which are assumed to be normally distributed. In\naddition, a calibration of prediction scores is done by using state level\nstatistics to further improve classification fairness.

Such problem setting generally is\npractical and valuable considering that it is feasible to collect unpaired\nnoisy and clean images in most real-world applications. And we further assume\nthat the noise can be signal dependent but is spatially uncorrelated. In order\nto facilitate unpaired learning of denoising network, this paper presents a\ntwo-stage scheme by incorporating self-supervised learning and knowledge\ndistillation. For self-supervised learning, we suggest a dilated blind-spot\nnetwork (D-BSN) to learn denoising solely from real noisy images. Due to the\nspatial independence of noise, we adopt a network by stacking 1x1 convolution\nlayers to estimate the noise level map for each image. Both the D-BSN and\nimage-specific noise model (CNN\\_est) can be jointly trained via maximizing the\nconstrained log-likelihood. Given the output of D-BSN and estimated noise level\nmap, improved denoising performance can be further obtained based on the Bayes'\nrule. As for knowledge distillation, we first apply the learned noise models to\nclean images to synthesize a paired set of training images, and use the real\nnoisy images and the corresponding denoising results in the first stage to form\nanother paired set. Then, the ultimate denoising model can be distilled by\ntraining an existing denoising network using these two paired sets.

State densities are often calculated with\nself-consistent mean-field approximations that do not include important\ncorrelations and have to be augmented with empirical collective enhancement\nfactors. Here, we benchmark the static-path plus random-phase approximation\n(SPA+RPA) to the state density in a chain of samarium isotopes $^{148-155}$Sm\nagainst exact results (up to statistical errors) obtained with the shell model\nMonte Carlo (SMMC) method. The SPA+RPA method incorporates all static\nfluctuations beyond the mean field together with small-amplitude quantal\nfluctuations around each static fluctuation. Using a pairing plus quadrupole\ninteraction, we show that the SPA+RPA state densities agree well with the exact\nSMMC densities for both the even- and odd-mass isotopes. For the even-mass\nisotopes, we also compare our results with mean-field state densities\ncalculated with the finite-temperature Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB)\napproximation. We find that the SPA+RPA repairs the deficiencies of the\nmean-field approximation associated with broken rotational symmetry in deformed\nnuclei and the violation of particle-number conservation in the pairing\ncondensate. In particular, in deformed nuclei the SPA+RPA reproduces the\nrotational enhancement of the state density relative to the mean-field state\ndensity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 16:42:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-16"}

Typically, these systems are subject to limitations\nsuch as disturbances, systems delays, constraints, uncertainties,\nunderperforming controllers, and unmodeled parameters that do not allow them to\nachieve the desired performance. In situations where it is not possible to\nredesign the inner-loop system, it is usual to incorporate an outer-loop\ncontrol that instructs the system to follow a modified reference path such that\nthe resultant path is close to the ideal one.

During this epoch,\nthe Sun was extremely quiet and unusually free from sunspots. However, despite\nreduced frequency, candidate aurorae were reported in the mid-European sector\nduring this period and have been associated with occurrences of interplanetary\ncoronal mass ejections (ICMEs), whereas some of them have been identified as\nmisinterpretations. Here, we have analysed reports of candidate aurorae on 1\nJune 1680 with simultaneous observations in mid-Europe, and compared their\ndescriptions with visual accounts of early modern aurorae. Most contemporary\nsunspot drawings from 22, 24, and 27 May 1680 have shown that this apparent\nsunspot may have been a source of ICMEs, which caused the reported candidate\naurorae. On the other hand, its intensity estimate shows that the magnetic\nstorm during this candidate aurora was probably within the capability of the\nstorms derived from the corotating interaction region (CIR).

This is in direct contrast to classical continuum analyses which\npredict a divergence in the elastic energy of the host material at a crystal\ngeometry dependent `critical' velocity $v_\\text{crit}$. Within this work, we\nfirst demonstrate through analytic analyses that the elastic energy of the host\nmaterial diverges at a dislocation velocity ($v_\\text{crit}$) which is greater\nthan $v_\\text{shear}$, i.e. $v_\\text{crit} > v_\\text{shear}$. We argue that it\nis this latter derived velocity ($v_\\text{crit}$) which separates `subsonic'\nand `supersonic' regimes of dislocation motion in the analytic solution.\n  In addition to our analyses, we also present a comprehensive suite of MD\nsimulation results of steady state screw dislocation motion for a range of\nstresses and several cubic metals at both cryogenic and room temperatures. At\nroom temperature, both our independent MD simulations and the earlier works\nfind stable screw dislocation motion only below our derived $v_\\text{crit}$.\nNonetheless, in real-world polycrystalline materials $v_\\text{crit}$ cannot be\ninterpreted as a hard limit for subsonic dislocation motion. In fact, at very\nlow temperatures our MD simulations of Cu at 10 Kelvin confirm a recent claim\nin the literature that true `supersonic' screw dislocations with dislocation\nvelocities $v>v_\\text{crit}$ are possible at very low temperatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 17:29:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 31 Oct 2020 01:37:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-16"}

We illustrate this by showing the existence of\nthe two types of DQPTs in a quantum Rabi model -- a system involving a\nspin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ and a bosonic mode. The dynamical criticality appears in the\nlimit of an infinitely large ratio of the spin frequency with respect to the\nbosonic one.

We find the critical times at which the rate function\nbecomes non-analytical, showing its associated critical exponent as well as the\ncorrections introduced by a finite frequency ratio.

Determining the elemental ratios for exoplanetary ecosystems\nis not yet possible, but we generally assume that planets have compositions\nsimilar to those of their host stars. Therefore, using the Hypatia Catalog of\nhigh-resolution stellar abundances for nearby stars, we compare the C, N, Si,\nand P abundance ratios of main sequence stars with those in average marine\nplankton, Earth's crust, as well as bulk silicate Earth and Mars. We find that,\nin general, plankton, Earth, and Mars are N-poor and P-rich compared with\nnearby stars. However, the dearth of P abundance data, which exists for only\n~1% of all stars and 1% of exoplanet hosts, makes it difficult to deduce clear\ntrends in the stellar data, let alone the role of P in the evolution of an\nexoplanet. Our Sun has relatively high P and Earth biology requires a small,\nbut finite, amount of P. On rocky planets that form around host stars with\nsubstantially less P, the strong partitioning of P into the core could rule out\nthe potential for surface P and, consequently, for life on that planet's\nsurface.

Of particular interest is a stochastic\napproach which involves (i) sampling from the free theory Gaussian\napproximation to the Wigner distribution in order to obtain stochastic initial\nconditions for the field and momentum conjugate, then (ii) evolving under the\nclassical field equations of motion, which leads to random bubble formation.\nPrevious work showed parametric agreement between the logarithm of the\ntunneling rate in this stochastic approach and the usual instanton\napproximation. However, recent work [1] claimed excellent agreement between\nthese methods. Here we show that this approach does not in fact match\nprecisely; the stochastic method tends to overpredict the instanton tunneling\nrate. To quantify this, we parameterize the standard deviations in the initial\nstochastic fluctuations by $\\epsilon \\sigma$, where $\\sigma$ is the actual\nstandard deviation of the Gaussian distribution and $\\epsilon$ is a fudge\nfactor; $\\epsilon = 1$ is the physical value. We numerically implement the\nstochastic approach to obtain the bubble formation rate for a range of\npotentials in 1+1-dimensions, finding that $\\epsilon$ always needs to be\nsomewhat smaller than unity to suppress the otherwise much larger stochastic\nrates towards the instanton rates; for example, in the potential of [1] one\nneeds $\\epsilon \\approx 1/2$. We find that a mismatch in predictions also\noccurs when sampling from other Wigner distributions, and in single particle\nquantum mechanics even when the initial quantum system is prepared in an exact\nGaussian state.

Using exact\ndiagonalization on lattices of up to 60 sites, we show that non-scar states\nconform to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Specifically, we show that\nenergies are distributed according to the Gaussian ensemble expected of their\nrespective symmetry sector, illustrate the existence of the scar from bipartite\nentanglement properties, and demonstrate revival phenomena in studies of\nfidelity dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 18:00:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Sep 2021 01:39:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-29"}

For example, the\nprototype 3d boundary state of 4d SPT states involving 1-form symmetries can be\neither a gapless photon phase (quantum electrodynamics) or gapped topological\norder enriched by 1-form symmetries, namely the loop excitations of these\ntopological orders carry nontrivial 1-form symmetry charges. This study also\nserves the purpose of diagnosing anomaly of 3d states of matter. Connection\nbetween SPT states with 1-form symmetries and condensed matter systems such as\nquantum dimer models at one lower dimension will also be discussed. Whether a\nquantum dimer model can have a trivial gapped phase or not depends on the\nnature of its corresponding bulk state in one higher dimension.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 18:00:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-24"}

The structure is populated by at least six members, four Lyman\nBreak Galaxies (LBGs) and two Lyman Alpha Emitters (LAEs). The four LBGs have\nbeen identified among a sample of 21 i-band dropouts with z{AB}<25.5 selected\nup to projected separations of 5 physical Mpc (15 arcmin) from the QSO. Their\nredshifts have been determined through up to 8hr-long multi-object\nspectroscopic observations at 8-10m class telescopes. The two LAEs have been\nidentified in a 6hr VLT/MUSE observation centered on the QSO. The redshifts of\nthe six galaxies cover the range 6.129-6.355. Assuming that peculiar velocities\nare negligible, this range corresponds to radial separations of +/-5 physical\nMpc from the QSO, that is comparable to the projected scale of the observed LBG\ndistribution on the sky. We conservatively estimate that this structure is\nsignificant at >3.5 sigma level, and that the level of the galaxy overdensity\nis at least 1.5-2 within the large volume sampled (~780 physical Mpc^3). The\nspectral properties of the six member galaxies (Lyalpha strength and UV\nluminosity) are similar to those of field galaxies at similar redshifts. This\nis the first spectroscopic identification of a galaxy overdensity around a\nsuper-massive black hole in the first billion years of the Universe. Our\nfinding lends support to the idea that the most distant and massive black holes\nform and grow within massive (>10^{12} Msun) dark matter halos in large scale\nstructures, and that the absence of earlier detections of such systems was\nlikely due to observational limitations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 18:00:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2020 17:23:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-07"}

We consider two variants of Majorana qubits: the Majorana\ntransmon and the Majorana box qubit. In both cases, the qubit-resonator\ninteraction can produce sizeable dispersive shifts in the MHz range for\nreasonable system parameters, allowing for submicrosecond readout with high\nfidelity. For Majorana transmons, the light-matter interaction used for readout\nmanifestly conserves Majorana parity, which leads to a notion of quantum\nnondemolition (QND) readout that is stronger than for conventional charge\nqubits. In contrast, Majorana box qubits only recover an approximately QND\nreadout mechanism in the dispersive limit where the resonator detuning is\nlarge. We also compare dispersive readout to longitudinal readout for the\nMajorana box qubit. We show that the latter gives faster and higher fidelity\nreadout for reasonable parameters, while having the additional advantage of\nbeing manifestly QND, and so may prove to be a better readout mechanism for\nthese systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 18:00:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 02:49:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-12"}

The Kerr geometry,\nwhich is unique in general relativity, admits a higher-order symmetry in the\nform of a Carter constant, which implies that the equations of motion\ndescribing test particle motion in a Kerr background are Liouville-integrable.\nIn this article, we investigate whether the Carter symmetry itself is\ndiscernible from a generic deformation of the Kerr metric in the gravitational\nwaveforms for such inspirals. We build on previous studies by constructing a\nnew metric which respects current observational constraints, describes a black\nhole, and contains two non-Kerr parameters, one of which controls the presence\nor absence of the Carter symmetry, thereby controlling the existence of chaotic\norbits, and another which serves as a generic deformation parameter. We find\nthat these two parameters introduce fundamentally distinct features into the\norbital dynamics, and evince themselves in the gravitational waveforms through\na significant dephasing. Although only explored in the quadrupole\napproximation, this, together with a Fisher metric analysis, suggests that\ngravitational wave data analysis may be able to test, in addition to the\ngoverning theory of gravity, the underlying symmetries of spacetime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 18:00:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2020 18:28:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-17"}

We present results from analysis of 2.7 years of NICER timing\nobservations, from 2017 August to 2020 April. We obtain a rotation\nphase-connected timing model for the entire timespan, which overlaps with the\nthird observing run of LIGO/Virgo, thus enabling the most sensitive\ngravitational wave searches of this potentially strong gravitational\nwave-emitting pulsar. We find that the short-term braking index between\nglitches decreases towards a value of 7 or lower at longer times since the\npreceding glitch. By combining NICER and RXTE data, we measure a long-term\nbraking index n=-1.25+/-0.01. Our analysis reveals 8 new glitches, the first\ndetected since 2011, near the end of RXTE, with a total NICER and RXTE glitch\nactivity of 8.88x10^-7 yr^-1. The new glitches follow the seemingly unique\ntime-to-next-glitch---glitch-size correlation established previously using RXTE\ndata, with a slope of 5 d microHz^-1. For one glitch around which NICER\nobserves two days on either side, we search for but do not see clear evidence\nof spectral nor pulse profile changes that may be associated with the glitch.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 18:01:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-30"}

Since intrinsic anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is not\nexpected for a chiral superconducting pairing developed on the single Ru\n$d_{xy}$ orbital, multiorbital chiral pairing actively involving the Ru\n$d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$ orbitals has been proposed as a potential mechanism. Here\nwe propose that AHE could still arise even if the chiral superconductivity is\npredominantly driven by the $d_{xy}$ orbital. This is demonstrated through two\nseparate models which take into account subdominant orbitals in the Cooper\npairing, one involving the oxygen $p_x$ and $p_y$ orbitals in the RuO$_2$\nplane, and another the $d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$ orbitals. In both models, finite\norbital mixing between the dominant $d_{xy}$ and the other orbitals may induce\ninter-orbital pairing between them, and the resultant states support intrinsic\nAHE, with Kerr rotation angles that could potentially reconcile with the\nexperimental observation. Our proposal therefore sheds new light on the\nmicroscopic pairing in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$.

Among them, the age of\nstars cannot be directly measured, while the mass and radius can be measured in\nsome particular cases (binary systems, interferometry). Stellar ages, masses,\nand radii have to be inferred from stellar evolution models by appropriate\ntechniques. We have designed a Python tool named SPInS. It takes a set of\nphotometric, spectroscopic, interferometric, and/or asteroseismic observational\nconstraints and, relying on a stellar model grid, provides the age, mass, and\nradius of a star, among others, as well as error bars and correlations. We make\nthe tool available to the community via a dedicated website. SPInS uses a\nBayesian approach to find the PDF of stellar parameters from a set of classical\nconstraints. At the heart of the code is a MCMC solver coupled with\ninterpolation within a pre-computed stellar model grid. Priors can be\nconsidered, such as the IMF or SFR. SPInS can characterise single stars or\ncoeval stars, such as members of binary systems or of stellar clusters. We\nillustrate the capabilities of SPInS by studying stars that are spread over the\nHertzsprung-Russell diagram. We then validate the tool by inferring the ages\nand masses of stars in several catalogues and by comparing them with literature\nresults. We show that in addition to the age and mass, SPInS can efficiently\nprovide derived quantities, such as the radius, surface gravity, and seismic\nindices.

Typically MRFs are complex and high-dimensional with\nnodes and edges (connections) built in a modular fashion from simpler,\nlow-dimensional probabilistic models and their local connections; in turn, this\nmodularity allows to incorporate available data to MRFs and efficiently\nsimulate them by leveraging their graph-theoretic structure.

When regularly sampled data are available, such as\nfor ground based and future space based interferometers, analyses are typically\nperformed in the frequency domain, where stationary (time invariant) noise\nprocesses can be modeled very efficiently. In reality, detector noise is not\nstationary due to a combination of short duration noise transients and longer\nduration drifts in the power spectrum.

These conditions are equivalent to certain nonlinear\nalgebraic relations for the components of $Y$. Such a map $Y$ may be nonlinear\nwith respect to parameters from $\\Omega$.\n  We present general results on such maps, including clarification of the\nstructure of the algebraic relations that define them and several\ntransformations which allow one to obtain new such maps from known ones.

Most widely known is the experiment in which a\nlong chain leaves an elevated beaker like a fountain and falls to the ground\nunder the influence of gravity. The observed chain fountain was precisely\ndescribed and predicted by an inverted catenary in several publications. The\nunderlying assumptions are a stationary fountain and the knowledge of the\nboundary conditions, the ground and beaker reaction forces. In contrast to\ndetermining the steady-state chain fountain shape, it turns out that the main\ndifficulty lies in predicting the reaction forces. A consistent and complete\nphysical explanation model is currently not available. In order to give a\nreasonable explanation for the reaction forces an illustrative mechanical\nsystem for generating steady-state chain fountain is proposed in this work.

A barrier to incorporating the full data is a\nlack of solid recommendations for variable selection, with researchers often\nhand-selecting a few variables. Thus, we evaluated the ability of empirical\nmachine learning approaches to identify social-environmental factors having a\ntrue association with a health outcome.\n  Materials and Methods: We compared several popular machine learning methods,\nincluding penalized regressions (e.g. lasso, elastic net), and tree ensemble\nmethods. Via simulation, we assessed the methods' ability to identify census\nvariables truly associated with binary and continuous outcomes while minimizing\nfalse positive results (10 true associations, 1,000 total variables). We\napplied the most promising method to the full census data (p=14,663 variables)\nlinked to prostate cancer registry data (n=76,186 cases) to identify\nsocial-environmental factors associated with advanced prostate cancer.\n  Results: In simulations, we found that elastic net identified many\ntrue-positive variables, while lasso provided good control of false positives.\nUsing a combined measure of accuracy, hierarchical clustering based on\nSpearman's correlation with sparse group lasso regression performed the best\noverall. Bayesian Adaptive Regression Trees outperformed other tree ensemble\nmethods, but not the sparse group lasso. In the full dataset, the sparse group\nlasso successfully identified a subset of variables, three of which replicated\nearlier findings.\n  Discussion: This analysis demonstrated the potential of empirical machine\nlearning approaches to identify a small subset of census variables having a\ntrue association with the outcome, and that replicate across empiric methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 19:04:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-02"}

However, for methods\ncurrently used in quantum computing such as select configuration interaction\n(CI) and coupled cluster (CC) methods, it is necessary to have a virtual space\nthat is able to capture a significant amount of electron-electron correlation\nin the system. The virtual orbitals in a pseudopotential plane-wave\nHartree--Fock calculation, because of Coulomb repulsion, are often scattering\nstates that interact very weakly with the filled orbitals. As a result, very\nlittle correlation energy is captured from them. The use of virtual spaces\nderived from the one-electron operators have also been tried, and while some\ncorrelation is captured, the amount is quite low. To overcome these\nlimitations, we have been developing new classes of algorithms to define\nvirtual spaces by optimizing orbitals from small pairwise CI Hamiltonians,\nwhich we term as correlation optimized virtual orbitals with the abbreviation\nCOVOs. With these procedures we have been able to derive virtual spaces,\ncontaining only a few orbitals, that are able to capture a significant amount\nof correlation. Besides, using these derived basis sets for quantum computing\ncalculations targeting full CI (FCI) quality-results, they can also be used in\nother many-body approaches, including CC and M{\\o}ller--Plesset perturbation\ntheories, and open up the door to many-body calculations for pseudopotential\nplane-wave basis set methods.

Given a scalar field f and a selection of extrema to preserve, the\nproposed localized topological simplification (LTS) derives a function g that\nis close to f and only exhibits the selected set of extrema. Specifically, sub-\nand superlevel set components associated with undesired extrema are first\nlocally flattened and then correctly embedded into the global scalar field,\nsuch that these regions are guaranteed -- from a combinatorial perspective --\nto no longer contain any undesired extrema. In contrast to previous global\napproaches, LTS only and independently processes regions of the domain that\nactually need to be simplified, which already results in a noticeable speedup.\nMoreover, due to the localized nature of the algorithm, LTS can utilize\nshared-memory parallelism to simplify regions simultaneously with a high\nparallel efficiency (70%). Hence, LTS significantly improves interactivity for\nthe exploration of simplification parameters and their effect on subsequent\ntopological analysis. For such exploration tasks, LTS brings the overall\nexecution time of a plethora of TDA pipelines from minutes down to seconds,\nwith an average observed speedup over state-of-the-art techniques of up to x36.\nFurthermore, in the special case where preserved extrema are selected based on\ntopological persistence, an adapted version of LTS partially computes the\npersistence diagram and simultaneously simplifies features below a predefined\npersistence threshold. The effectiveness of LTS, its parallel efficiency, and\nits resulting benefits for TDA are demonstrated on several simulated and\nacquired datasets from different application domains, including physics,\nchemistry, and biomedical imaging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 19:57:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-02"}

The proposed method is based on the Gaussian mixture probability\nhypothesis density (GMPHD) filter, a hierarchical data association (HDA), and a\nmask-based affinity fusion (MAF) model to achieve high-performance online\ntracking. The HDA consists of two associations: segment-to-track and\ntrack-to-track associations. One affinity, for position and motion, is computed\nby using the GMPHD filter, and the other affinity, for appearance is computed\nby using the responses from a single object tracker such as a kernalized\ncorrelation filter. These two affinities are simply fused by using a\nscore-level fusion method such as min-max normalization referred to as MAF. In\naddition, to reduce the number of false positive segments, we adopt mask\nIoU-based merging (mask merging). The proposed MOTS framework with the key\nmodules: HDA, MAF, and mask merging, is easily extensible to simultaneously\ntrack multiple types of objects with CPU only execution in parallel processing.\nIn addition, the developed framework only requires simple parameter tuning\nunlike many existing MOTS methods that need intensive hyperparameter\noptimization. In the experiments on the two popular MOTS datasets, the key\nmodules show some improvements. For instance, ID-switch decreases by more than\nhalf compared to a baseline method in the training sets.

Alice encrypts the\ninput before sending it to Oscar, and Oscar performs the computation directly\non the encrypted data, producing an encrypted result.

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved great success in\ngraph representation learning. However, expressive power of GNNs is limited by\nthe 1-Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test and thus GNNs generate identical\nrepresentations for graph substructures that may in fact be very different.\nMore powerful GNNs, proposed recently by mimicking higher-order-WL tests, only\nfocus on representing entire graphs and they are computationally inefficient as\nthey cannot utilize sparsity of the underlying graph. Here we propose and\nmathematically analyze a general class of structure-related features, termed\nDistance Encoding (DE). DE assists GNNs in representing any set of nodes, while\nproviding strictly more expressive power than the 1-WL test. DE captures the\ndistance between the node set whose representation is to be learned and each\nnode in the graph. To capture the distance DE can apply various graph-distance\nmeasures such as shortest path distance or generalized PageRank scores. We\npropose two ways for GNNs to use DEs (1) as extra node features, and (2) as\ncontrollers of message aggregation in GNNs. Both approaches can utilize the\nsparse structure of the underlying graph, which leads to computational\nefficiency and scalability. We also prove that DE can distinguish node sets\nembedded in almost all regular graphs where traditional GNNs always fail. We\nevaluate DE on three tasks over six real networks: structural role prediction,\nlink prediction, and triangle prediction. Results show that our models\noutperform GNNs without DE by up-to 15\\% in accuracy and AUROC.

A defector is one who does not pay any cost but enjoys the\nbenefits of cooperators. Human societies, especially, have evolved a strategy\nto discourage defection, punishment. Costly punishment is a type of punishment\nwhere an agent in a biological network or some cooperative scheme pays a cost\nto ensure another agent incurs some cost. A previous study shows how parameters\nlike diversity in neighbors across games, density of connectivity, and costly\npunishment influence the evolution of cooperation in non-regular networks. In\nthis study, evolution in regular networks due to the influence of costly\npunishment is also considered, specifically spatial lattices. This study\ncompares observations between non-regular and regular networks as these\nparameters change and brings a clearer understanding of interactions that occur\nin these networks. The models, results and analysis bring a new understanding\nto game theory and punishment. The results show that costly punishment never\narises as a sole evolutionary strategy. However, in evolutionary games where\ncostly punishers could evolve more favorable strategies, the initial presence\nof costly punishers would bring about high average payoffs in all types of\nregular networks and heterogeneous networks. In regular networks, every node\nhas the same degree, k. Although punishment is conventionally thought to be\nanti-progressive, in the presence of diversity in neighbors, it magnifies the\npayoff of a group for all heterogeneous networks. In regular networks however,\ndiversity in neighbors is not required for costly punishment to boost average\npayoff. This suggests an answer to the question on why costly punishment has\nbeen favored by natural selection, which is particularly obvious in human\npopulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 23:19:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-02"}

In the first\none we study quantum channels, which are the most general operations mapping\nquantum states into quantum states, from the point of view of their\ndivisibility properties. We introduced tools to test if a given quantum channel\ncan be implemented by a process described by a Lindblad master equation. This\nin turn defines channels that can be divided in such a way that they form a\none-parameter semigroup, thus introducing the most restricted studied\ndivisibility type of this work. Using our results, together with the study of\nother types of divisibility that can be found in the literature, we\ncharacterized the space of qubit quantum channels. We found interesting results\nconnecting the concept of entanglement-breaking channel and infinitesimal\ndivisibility. Additionally we proved that infinitely divisible channels are\nequivalent to the ones that are implementable by one-parameter semigroups,\nopening this question for more general channel spaces. In the second project we\nstudy the functional forms of one-mode Gaussian quantum channels in the\nposition state representation, beyond Gaussian functional forms. We perform a\nblack-box characterization using complete positivity and trace preserving\nconditions, and report the existence of two subsets that do not have a\nfunctional Gaussian form. The study covers as particular limit the case of\nsingular channels, thus connecting our results with the known classification\nscheme based on canonical forms. Our full characterization of Gaussian channels\nwithout Gaussian functional form is completed by showing how Gaussian states\nare transformed under these operations, and by deriving the conditions for the\nexistence of master equations for the non-singular cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2020 00:53:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-02"}

In the isotropic\nlimit, accelerating pure screw and edge dislocations were studied some time\nago. A generalization to anisotropic crystals has been attempted for pure screw\nand edge dislocations only for some special cases. This work aims to fill the\ngap of deriving a general anisotropic solution for pure screw dislocations\napplicable to slip systems featuring a reflection symmetry, a prerequisite to\nstudying pure screw dislocations without mixing with edge dislocations. Further\ngeneralizations to arbitrary mixed dislocations as well as regularizations of\nthe dislocation core are beyond the scope of this paper and are left for future\nwork.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2020 01:28:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2020 19:04:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2020 23:12:13 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2021 20:07:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-27"}

On the other hand, there is a growing need to capture\nhigh resolution images using unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and to develop\nbetter algorithms in order to find highly accurate and to the point results. In\nthis paper, we propose a segmentation and extraction-based technique to detect\nfusarium wilt in radish crops. Recent wilt detection algorithms are either\nbased on image processing techniques or conventional machine learning\nalgorithms. However, our methodology is based on a hybrid algorithm, which\ncombines image processing and machine learning. First, the crop image is\ndivided into three segments, which include viz., healthy vegetation, ground and\npacking material. Based on the HSV decision tree algorithm, all the three\nsegments are segregated from the image. Second, the extracted segments are\nsummed together into an empty canvas of the same resolution as the image and\none new image is produced. Third, this new image is compared with the original\nimage, and a final noisy image, which contains traces of wilt is extracted.\nFinally, a k-means algorithm is applied to eliminate the noise and to extract\nthe accurate wilt from it. Moreover, the extracted wilt is mapped on the\noriginal image using the contouring method. The proposed combination of\nalgorithms detects the wilt appropriately, which surpasses the traditional\npractice of separately using the image processing techniques or machine\nlearning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2020 01:37:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-02"}

Only 8% of all ejected BHBs merge within the age of\nthe Universe. Systems in this merging subset tend to have smaller separations\nand larger eccentricities, as this combination of parameters results in greater\nemission of gravitational radiation.

Voters in each district elect a representative. The\nprimary criteria are: each district is connected, district populations are\nequal (or nearly equal), and districts are \"compact\". There are multiple\ncompeting definitions of compactness, usually minimizing some quantity.\n  One measure that has been recently promoted by Duchin and others is number of\ncut edges. In redistricting, one is given atomic regions out of which each\ndistrict must be built. The populations of the atomic regions are given.\nConsider the graph with one vertex per atomic region (with weight equal to the\nregion's population) and an edge between atomic regions that share a boundary.\nA districting plan is a partition of vertices into $k$ parts, each connnected,\nof nearly equal weight. The districts are considered compact to the extent that\nthe plan minimizes the number of edges crossing between different parts.\n  Consider two problems: find the most compact districting plan, and sample\ndistricting plans under a compactness constraint uniformly at random. Both\nproblems are NP-hard so we restrict the input graph to have branchwidth at most\n$w$. (A planar graph's branchwidth is bounded by its diameter.) If both $k$ and\n$w$ are bounded by constants, the problems are solvable in polynomial time.\nAssume vertices have weight~1. One would like algorithms whose running times\nare of the form $O(f(k,w) n^c)$ for some constant $c$ independent of $k$ and\n$w$, in which case the problems are said to be fixed-parameter tractable with\nrespect to $k$ and $w$). We show that, under a complexity-theoretic assumption,\nno such algorithms exist. However, we do give algorithms with running time\n$O(c^wn^{k+1})$. Thus if the diameter of the graph is moderately small and the\nnumber of districts is very small, our algorithm is useable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2020 02:30:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-02"}

However, recent works show\nthat GNNs are vulnerable to evasion attacks, i.e., an attacker can slightly\nperturb the graph structure to fool GNN models. Existing evasion attacks to\nGNNs have several key drawbacks: 1) they are limited to attack two-layer GNNs;\n2) they are not efficient; or/and 3) they need to know GNN model parameters. We\naddress the above drawbacks in this paper and propose an influence-based\nevasion attack against GNNs. Specifically, we first introduce two influence\nfunctions, i.e., feature-label influence and label influence, that are defined\non GNNs and label propagation (LP), respectively. Then, we build a strong\nconnection between GNNs and LP in terms of influence. Next, we reformulate the\nevasion attack against GNNs to be related to calculating label influence on LP,\nwhich is applicable to multi-layer GNNs and does not need to know the GNN\nmodel. We also propose an efficient algorithm to calculate label influence.\nFinally, we evaluate our influence-based attack on three benchmark graph\ndatasets. Our experimental results show that, compared to state-of-the-art\nattack, our attack can achieve comparable attack performance, but has a 5-50x\nspeedup when attacking two-layer GNNs. Moreover, our attack is effective to\nattack multi-layer GNNs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2020 03:24:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 12 Sep 2020 20:50:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-15"}

Compared to them, the range image representation\nis dense and compact which can exploit powerful 2D convolution. Even so, the\nrange image is not preferred in 3D object detection due to scale variation and\nocclusion. In this paper, we utilize the dilated residual block (DRB) to better\nadapt different object scales and obtain a more flexible receptive field.\nConsidering scale variation and occlusion, we propose the RV-PV-BEV (range\nview-point view-bird's eye view) module to transfer features from RV to BEV.\nThe anchor is defined in BEV which avoids scale variation and occlusion.\nNeither RV nor BEV can provide enough information for height estimation;\ntherefore, we propose a two-stage RCNN for better 3D detection performance.

The popular method, Monte Carlo Localization (MCL) addresses the\nproblem by iteratively updating a set of particles with a \"sampling-weighting\"\nloop. Sampling is decisive to the performance of MCL [1]. However, traditional\nMCL can only sample from a uniform distribution over the state space. Although\nvariants of MCL propose different sampling models, they fail to provide an\naccurate distribution or generalize across scenes. To better deal with these\nproblems, we present a distribution proposal model, named Deep Samplable\nObservation Model (DSOM).

Agents' preferences over the form of the network\nconsist of an arbitrary network benefit function (e.g., agents may have\npreferences over their network centrality) and a private component which is\nadditively separable in own links. This latter component allows for unobserved\nheterogeneity in the costs of sending and receiving links across agents\n(respectively out- and in- degree heterogeneity) as well as\nhomophily/heterophily across the $K$ types of agents. In contrast, the network\nbenefit function allows agents' preferences over links to vary with the\npresence or absence of links elsewhere in the network (and hence with the link\nformation behavior of their peers). In the null model which excludes the\nnetwork benefit function, links form independently across dyads in the manner\ndescribed by \\cite{Charbonneau_EJ17}.

Unstructured planetary-like environments pose a major\nchallenge to these systems due to the similarity of the terrain.

The key idea is to use a novel continuous and\nprobabilistic representations of terrain elevation maps.

Traditional image registration techniques are\nthen used to search for potential matches.

Though heatmap regression is robust to\nlarge variations in pose, illumination, and occlusion in unconstrained\nsettings, it usually suffers from a sub-pixel localization problem.\nSpecifically, considering that the activation point indices in heatmaps are\nalways integers, quantization error thus appears when using heatmaps as the\nrepresentation of numerical coordinates. Previous methods to overcome the\nsub-pixel localization problem usually rely on high-resolution heatmaps. As a\nresult, there is always a trade-off between achieving localization accuracy and\ncomputational cost, where the computational complexity of heatmap regression\ndepends on the heatmap resolution in a quadratic manner. In this paper, we\nformally analyze the quantization error of vanilla heatmap regression and\npropose a simple yet effective quantization system to address the sub-pixel\nlocalization problem. The proposed quantization system induced by the\nrandomized rounding operation 1) encodes the fractional part of numerical\ncoordinates into the ground truth heatmap using a probabilistic approach during\ntraining; and 2) decodes the predicted numerical coordinates from a set of\nactivation points during testing. We prove that the proposed quantization\nsystem for heatmap regression is unbiased and lossless. Experimental results on\npopular facial landmark localization datasets (WFLW, 300W, COFW, and AFLW) and\nhuman pose estimation datasets (MPII and COCO) demonstrate the effectiveness of\nthe proposed method for efficient and accurate semantic landmark localization.\nCode is available at http://github.com/baoshengyu/H3R.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2020 04:54:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Aug 2021 09:34:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-27"}

This theory of gravity combines the gravitation effects through the\nnon-metricity scalar function $Q$, and manifestations from the quantum era of\nthe Universe in the classical theory (due to the presence of the trace of the\nenergy-momentum tensor $T$). Our investigation unveils the viability of\n$f(Q,T)$ gravity to describe the accelerated expansion our Universe passes\nthrough. Besides, one of our models naturally provides a phantom regime for\ndark energy and satisfies the dominant energy condition. The results here\nderived strength the viability of $f(Q,T)$ as a promising complete theory of\ngravity, lighting a new path towards the description of the dark sector of the\nUniverse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2020 05:21:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 7 Nov 2020 07:06:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 29 Nov 2020 03:42:54 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 11 Feb 2021 04:02:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-18"}

The invariance of the Lagrangian of the system under an\narbitrary spatial coordinate transformation is used to derive the local\nmomentum balance equation satisfied by the gyrocenter distribution functions\nand the turbulent potential which are given as solutions of the governing\nequations. This derivation is in contrast with the conventional method using\nthe spatial translation in which the asymmetric canonical pressure tensor\ngenerally enters the momentum balance equation. In the present study, the\nvariation of the Lagrangian density with respect to the metric tensor is taken\nto directly obtain the symmetric pressure tensor which includes the effect of\nturbulence on the momentum transport.

The mainstay of the present approach is to treat quantities defined\non the co-tangent bundles of reference and deformed configurations as primal.\nSuch a treatment invites compatibility equations so that the base space\n(configurations of the solid body) could be realised as a subset of an\nEuclidean space. Cartan's method of moving frames and the associated structure\nequations establish this compatibility. Moreover, they permit us to write the\nmetric and connection using 1-forms. With the mathematical machinery provided\nby differentiable manifolds, we rewrite the deformation gradient and\nCauchy-Green deformation tensor in terms of frame and co-frame fields. The\ngeometric understanding of stress as a co-vector valued 2-form fits squarely\nwithin our overall program.

The spin of low mass\ndisks (and spheroids at low redshifts) tend to be parallel with the tidal\nfield, while the spin of massive spheroids and disks tend to be perpendicular\nto tidal field. The shape and spin of massive centrals align with the tidal\nfield at both small and large scales. Satellites show a radial alignment within\nthe one-halo term region, and low mass satellites have an intriguing alignment\nsignal in the two-halo term region. We also forecast a feasibility to measure\nthe intrinsic alignment power spectrum for spectroscopic and imaging surveys\nsuch as Subaru HSC/PFS and DESI. Our results thus suggest that galaxy intrinsic\nalignment can be used as a promising tool for constraining the galaxy formation\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2020 07:43:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2021 15:14:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-17"}

While state-of-the-art DNN designs have\nleveraged performance predictors to speed up the optimization process, they are\ndevice-specific (i.e., each predictor for only one target device) and hence\ncannot scale well in the presence of extremely diverse edge devices. Moreover,\neven with performance predictors, the optimizer (e.g., search-based\noptimization) can still be time-consuming when optimizing DNNs for many\ndifferent devices.

To\nensure that the recognition algorithm is not affected by low-quality images,\ntraditional hand-crafted factors based methods discard most images, which will\ncause system timeout and disrupt user experience. In this paper, we propose a\nrecognition-oriented quality metric and assessment method for iris image to\ndeal with the problem. The method regards the iris image embeddings Distance in\nFeature Space (DFS) as the quality metric and the prediction is based on deep\nneural networks with the attention mechanism. The quality metric proposed in\nthis paper can significantly improve the performance of the recognition\nalgorithm while reducing the number of images discarded for recognition, which\nis advantageous over hand-crafted factors based iris quality assessment\nmethods.

The latter factor is of particular\nimportance for industrial flow problems, where unstructured grids are typically\nemployed due to the necessity to handle complex geometries. Here, a systematic\nsimulation-based study is presented, investigating the effect of grid-cell type\non the predictive accuracy of wall-modelled LES in the framework of a\ngeneral-purpose finite-volume solver. Following standard practice for meshing\nnear-wall regions, it is proposed to use prismatic cells. Three candidate\nshapes for the base of the prisms are considered: a triangle, a quadrilateral,\nand an arbitrary polygon. The cell-centre distance is proposed as a metric to\ndetermine the spatial resolution of grids with different cell types. The\nsimulation campaign covers two test cases with attached boundary layers:\nfully-developed turbulent channel flow, and a zero-pressure-gradient flat-plate\nturbulent boundary layer. A grid construction strategy is employed, which\nadapts the grid metric to the outer length scale of the boundary layer. The\nresults are compared with DNS data concerning mean wall shear stress and\nprofiles of flow statistics. The principle outcome is that unstructured\nsimulations may provide the same accuracy as simulations on structured\northogonal hexahedral grids. The choice of base shape of the near-wall cells\nhas a significant impact on the computational cost, but in terms of accuracy\nappears to be a factor of secondary importance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2020 09:07:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-02"}

In order to prevent some of the possible attacks,\nthese explicit authentication systems can be enhanced by considering a\ntwo-factor authentication scheme, in which the second factor is an implicit\nauthentication system based on analyzing motion sensor data captured by\naccelerometers or gyroscopes. In order to avoid any additional burdens to the\nuser, the registration process of the implicit authentication system must be\nperformed quickly, i.e. the number of data samples collected from the user is\ntypically small. In the context of designing a machine learning model for\nimplicit user authentication based on motion signals, data augmentation can\nplay an important role. In this paper, we study several data augmentation\ntechniques in the quest of finding useful augmentation methods for motion\nsensor data.

Recent generative methods formulate GZSL as a missing data\nproblem, which mainly adopts GANs or VAEs to generate visual features for\nunseen classes. However, GANs often suffer from instability, and VAEs can only\noptimize the lower bound on the log-likelihood of observed data. To overcome\nthe above limitations, we resort to generative flows, a family of generative\nmodels with the advantage of accurate likelihood estimation.

The dynamically changing AoIs and a\nnumber of pedestrians in video frames increase the difficulty and computational\ncomplexity of determining whether pedestrians intrude the AoI, which makes\nprevious algorithms incapable of this task. In this paper, we propose a novel\nand efficient multi-task deep neural network, PIDNet, to solve this problem.\nPIDNet is mainly designed by considering two factors: accurately segmenting the\ndynamically changing AoIs from a video frame captured by the moving camera and\nquickly detecting pedestrians from the generated AoI-contained areas. Three\nefficient network designs are proposed and incorporated into PIDNet to reduce\nthe computational complexity: 1) a special PID task backbone for feature\nsharing, 2) a feature cropping module for feature cropping, and 3) a lighter\ndetection branch network for feature compression. In addition, considering\nthere are no public datasets and benchmarks in this field, we establish a\nbenchmark dataset to evaluate the proposed network and give the corresponding\nevaluation metrics for the first time. Experimental results show that PIDNet\ncan achieve 67.1% PID accuracy and 9.6 fps inference speed on the proposed\ndataset, which serves as a good baseline for the future vision-based dynamic\nPID study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2020 09:34:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-02"}

It\nis still very challenging to use only a few labeled samples to train deep\nlearning models to reach a high classification accuracy. An active\ndeep-learning framework trained by an end-to-end manner is, therefore, proposed\nby this paper in order to minimize the hyperspectral image classification\ncosts. First, a deep densely connected convolutional network is considered for\nhyperspectral image classification. Different from the traditional active\nlearning methods, an additional network is added to the designed deep densely\nconnected convolutional network to predict the loss of input samples. Then, the\nadditional network could be used to suggest unlabeled samples that the deep\ndensely connected convolutional network is more likely to produce a wrong\nlabel. Note that the additional network uses the intermediate features of the\ndeep densely connected convolutional network as input. Therefore, the proposed\nmethod is an end-to-end framework. Subsequently, a few of the selected samples\nare labelled manually and added to the training samples. The deep densely\nconnected convolutional network is therefore trained using the new training\nset. Finally, the steps above are repeated to train the whole framework\niteratively.

Philosophers frequently use epistemic logic to model\nreasoning and knowledge abstractly, and to formally study the ramifications of\nepistemic assumptions. One famous example is Fitch's paradox, which begins with\nminimal knowledge axioms and derives the counter-intuitive result that \"every\nagent knows every true statement.\" Accounting for knowledge that arises from\nphysical theories complicates matters further. For example, quantum mechanics\nallows observers to model other agents as quantum systems themselves, and to\nmake predictions about measurements performed on each others' memories.\nMoreover, complex thought experiments in which agents' memories are modelled as\nquantum systems show that multi-agent reasoning chains can yield paradoxical\nresults.\n  Here, we bridge the gap between quantum paradoxes and foundational problems\nin epistemic logic, by relating the assumptions behind the recent\nFrauchiger-Renner quantum thought experiment and the axioms for knowledge used\nin Fitch's knowability paradox. Our results indicate that agents' knowledge of\nquantum systems must violate at least one of the following assumptions: it\ncannot be distributive over conjunction, have a kind of internal continuity,\nand yield a constructive interpretation all at once. Indeed, knowledge provided\nby quantum mechanics apparently contradicts traditional notions of how\nknowledge behaves; for instance, it may not be possible to universally assign\nobjective truth values to claims about agent knowledge. We discuss the\nrelations of this work to results in quantum contextuality and explore possible\nmodifications to standard epistemic logic that could make it consistent with\nquantum theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2020 10:03:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-02"}

We show how to make a magneto-optical trap of\nYbF molecules and how the molecules could be loaded into an optical lattice.\neEDM measurements could be made using the slow molecular beam or using\nmolecules trapped in the lattice. We estimate the statistical sensitivity that\ncould be reached in each case and consider how sources of noise can be reduced\nso that the shot-noise limit of sensitivity can be reached. We also consider\nsystematic effects due to magnetic fields and vector light shifts and how they\ncould be controlled.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2020 10:59:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-14"}

This is balanced in equilibrium by an interaction\nbetween the resulting jet and the vertical motion of the atmosphere. The\nthree-dimensional structure of the zonal acceleration is vital to this\nmechanism.\n  We demonstrate this mechanism in a hierarchy of models. We calculate the\nthree-dimensional stationary waves induced by the forcing on these planets, and\nshow the vertical structure of the zonal acceleration produced by these waves,\nwhich we use to suggest a mechanism for how the jet forms.

Nonetheless, it might be difficult to gather\nenough data to precisely capture the behavior of a biological system into a set\nof Boolean functions. These issues can be dealt with to some extent using\nparametrised Boolean networks (ParBNs), as it allows to leave some update\nfunctions unspecified. In this paper, we attack the control problem for ParBNs\nwith asynchronous semantics. While there is an extensive work on controlling\nBNs without parameters, the problem of control for ParBNs has not been in fact\naddressed yet. The goal of control is to ensure the stabilisation of a system\nin a given state using as few interventions as possible. There are many ways to\ncontrol BN dynamics. Here, we consider the one-step approach in which the\nsystem is instantaneously perturbed out of its actual state. A naive approach\nto handle control of ParBNs is using parameter scan and solve the control\nproblem for each parameter valuation separately using known techniques for\nnon-parametrised BNs. This approach is however highly inefficient as the\nparameter space of ParBNs grows doubly-exponentially in the worst case.

The\nanalysis focuses on two types of vortices appearing on marine propellers: tip\nvortices developing in lower advance ratio numbers and leading-edge tip\nvortices developing in higher advance ratio numbers. It is shown that as the\norigin and formation of these two types of vortices differ, different roughness\npatterns are needed to mitigate them with respect to performance degradation of\npropeller performance. Our findings clarify that the combination of having\nroughness on the blade tip and a limited area on the leading edge is the\noptimum roughness pattern where a reasonable balance between tip vortex\ncavitation mitigation and performance degradation can be achieved. This pattern\nin model scale condition leads to an average TVC mitigation of 37% with an\naverage performance degradation of 1.8% while in full scale condition an\naverage TVC mitigation of 22% and performance degradation of 1.4% are obtained.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2020 11:36:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-02"}

In search\nfor a general explanation for the long-term evolution of interstate structure,\nwe empirically examine the structural balance theory which predicts that a\nsigned network evolves toward a more \"balanced\" structure where in many\ntriangular relationships (i.e., triads) two states tend to share a common enemy\nor three states cooperate with each other. We investigate the network of\nalliances (positive edges) and rivalries (negative edges) between sovereign\nstates and examine whether its evolution from 1816 to 2009 can be explained by\nthe structural balance theory.

The empirical pattern follows the\nprediction by the theory before the German unification in the nineteenth\ncentury and after World War II while inconsistent in the middle period. This\nresult reveals the impact of the two historical events on the underlying\nmechanism of network evolution.

The amount of drift is modulated\nby the asteroid spin state evolution which determines the balance between the\ndiurnal and seasonal Yarkovsky force. The asteroid's spin state is, in turn,\ncontrolled in part by the YORP effect. The otherwise smooth evolution of an\nasteroid can be abruptly altered by collisions, which can cause impulsive\nchanges in the spin state and can move the asteroid onto a different YORP\ntrack. In addition, collisions may also alter the YORP parameters by changing\nthe superficial features and overall shape of the asteroid. Thus, the coupling\nbetween YORP and Yarkovsky is also strongly affected by the impact history of\neach body. To investigate this coupling we developed a statistical code\nmodeling the time evolution of semi--major axis under YORP-Yarkovsky coupling.\nIt includes the contributions of NYORP (normal YORP), TYORP (tangential YORP)\nand collisions whose effects are deterministically calculated and not added in\na statistical way. We find that both collisions and TYORP increase the\ndispersion of a family in semi-major axis by making the spin axis evolution\nless smooth and regular. We show that the evolution of a family's structure\nwith time is complex and collisions randomize the YORP evolution. In our test\nfamilies we do not observe the formation of a 'YORP-eye' in the semi-major axis\nvs. diameter distribution, even after a long period of time.

Due to\ntime-varying aerodynamic forces, such systems do not display fixed points of\nequilibrium. The problem is therefore approached via a limit cycle analysis\nbased on Floquet theory. Stability is assessed from the eigenvalues of the\nJacobian matrix associated to the limit cycle, also known as the Floquet\nmultipliers. We developed this framework to analyze the flapping flight\nequations of motion of a bird in the longitudinal plane. Such a system is known\nto be not only non-linear and time-dependent, but also driven by\nstate-dependent forcing aerodynamic forces. A model accounting for wing\nmorphing under prescribed kinematics is developed for generating realistic\nstate-dependent aerodynamic forces. The morphing wing geometry results from the\nenvelope of continuously articulated rigid bodies, modeling bones and feather\nrachises, and capturing biologically relevant degrees of freedom. A sensitivity\nanalysis is carried out which allows studying several flight configurations in\ntrimmed state. Our numerical results show that in such a system one instability\nmode is ubiquitous, thus suggesting the importance of sensory feedback to\nachieve steady-state flapping flight in birds. The effect of wingbeat\namplitude, governed by the shoulder joint, is found to be crucial in tuning the\ngait towards level flight, but marginally affects stability. In contrast, the\nrelative position between the wing and the center of mass is found to\nsignificantly affect the values of Floquet multipliers, suggesting that the\ndistribution of pitching moment plays a very important role in flapping flight\nstability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2020 12:57:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-28"}

This review is aimed to complement\nrecent efforts to compile and summarize this change of paradigm in the\ninterpretation of galaxy evolution. In particular we cover three particular\naspects not fully covered in detail in recent reviews: (i) the spatially\nresolved nature of the ionization properties in galaxies and the confusion\nintroduced by considering just integrated quantities; (ii) the nature of the\nglobal scaling relations and their relations with the spatially resolved ones;\nand (iii) the dependence of the radial gradients and characteristic properties\nof the stellar populations and ionized gas on stellar mass and galaxy\nmorphology.

We put forward an efficient two-parameter form for the word length\ndistribution, and introduce a simple representation of mishearings, which we\nuse in our subsequent modelling of word recognition. In a context-free\nscenario, word recognition often occurs via anticipation when, part-way into a\nword, we can correctly guess its full form. We give a quantitative estimate of\nthis anticipation threshold when no mishearings occur, in terms of model\nparameters. As might be expected, the whole anticipation effect disappears when\nthere are sufficiently many mishearings. Our global approach to the problem of\nspeech perception is in the spirit of an optimisation problem. We show for\ninstance that speech perception is easy when the word length is less than a\nthreshold, to be identified with a static transition, and hard otherwise. We\nextend this to the dynamics of word recognition, proposing an intuitive\napproach highlighting the distinction between individual, isolated mishearings\nand clusters of contiguous mishearings. At least in some parameter range, a\ndynamical transition is manifest well before the static transition is reached,\nas is the case for many other examples of complex systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2020 13:58:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-19"}

More precisely, to limit the spread of a virus, the\npopulation can decrease the transmission rate of the disease by reducing\ninteractions between individuals. However, this effort, which cannot be\nperfectly monitored by the government, comes at social and monetary cost for\nthe population. To mitigate this cost, and thus encourage the lockdown of the\npopulation, the government can put in place an incentive policy, in the form of\na tax or subsidy. In addition, the government may also implement a testing\npolicy in order to know more precisely the spread of the epidemic within the\ncountry, and to isolate infected individuals. In terms of technical results, we\ndemonstrate the optimal form of the tax, indexed on the proportion of infected\nindividuals, as well as the optimal effort of the population, namely the\ntransmission rate chosen in response to this tax. The government's optimisation\nproblem then boils down to solving an Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation.\nNumerical results confirm that if a tax policy is implemented, the population\nis encouraged to significantly reduce its interactions. If the government also\nadjusts its testing policy, less effort is required on the population side,\nindividuals can interact almost as usual, and the epidemic is largely contained\nby the targeted isolation of positively-tested individuals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2020 14:36:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Apr 2022 15:28:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-14"}

This induced water polarization\nconsequently influences multiple phenomena. In particular, water polarization\nmodulated by nanoconfinement affects ion adsorption and transport, biomolecular\nself-assembly, and surface chemical reactions. Therefore, it is of paramount\nimportance to understand how water-mediated interactions change at the\nnanoscale. Here we show that near the graphene surface anion-cation\ninteractions do not obey the translational and isotropic symmetries of\nCoulomb's law. We identify a new property, referred to as non-reciprocity,\nwhich describes the non-equivalent and directional interaction between two\noppositely charged ions near the confining surface when their positions with\nrespect to the interface are exchanged. Specifically, upon exchange of the two\nions' positions along the surface normal direction the interaction energy\nchanges by about 5$k_BT$. In both cases, confinement enhances the attraction\nbetween two oppositely charged ions near the graphene surface, while\nintercalation of one ion into the graphene layers shifts the interaction to\nrepulsive. While the water permittivity in confinement is different from that\nin bulk, the effects observed here via molecular dynamics simulations and X-ray\nreflectivity experiments cannot be accounted for by current permittivity\nmodels. Our work shows that the water structure is not enough to infer\nelectrostatic interactions near interfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2020 14:52:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Nov 2020 18:24:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-25"}

The\nbiophysical characterization of such motile processes, in health and disease,\nhas so far focused mostly on two limiting cases: single-cell motility on the\none hand, and the dynamics of confluent tissues such as the epithelium on the\nother. The in-between regime of clusters, composed of relatively few cells,\nmoving as a coherent unit has received less attention. Such small clusters are,\nhowever, deeply relevant in development but also in cancer metastasis. In this\nwork, we use cellular Potts models and analytical active matter theory to\nunderstand how the motility of small cell clusters changes with N, the number\nof cells in the cluster. Modeling and theory reveal our two main findings:\nCluster persistence time increases with N while the intrinsic diffusivity\ndecreases with N. We discuss a number of settings in which the motile\nproperties of more complex clusters can be analytically understood, revealing\nthat the focusing effects of small-scale cooperation and cell-cell alignment\ncan overcome the increased bulkiness and internal disorder of multicellular\nclusters to enhance overall migrational efficacy. We demonstrate this\nenhancement for small-cluster collective durotaxis, which is shown to proceed\nmore effectively than for single cells.

Moreover, such approaches are trained to perform either of the two\ntasks - deblurring or interpolation - in isolation, while many practical\nsituations call for both. Different from these works, we address a more\nrealistic problem of high frame-rate sharp video synthesis with no prior\nassumption that input is always blurry.

The methods for c real\nmodified to complex arithmetic work reasonably well as long as ci is very\nsmall. This paper describes the substantial changes necessary to obtain useful\nresults for larger values of ci. It shows that accurate eigenvalues can usually\nbe obtained even though the matrix methods used to obtain them for c real\nprovide increasingly inaccurate values, primarily for those with relatively\nsmall magnitude, as ci increases.

The familiarity heuristic is operationalized by two criteria,\nstrong and weak familiarity with the place. Results demonstrate the effects of\nboth heuristics. Measurements through our serious game are discussed in the\nperspective of developing an interactive prevention tool for mitigating the\nnegative effects of heuristics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2020 08:10:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-22"}

While neuromorphic sensing and perception, as well as\ndecision-making systems, are now mature, the control and actuation part is\nlagging behind. In this paper, we present a closed-loop motor controller\nimplemented on mixed-signal analog-digital neuromorphic hardware using a\nspiking neural network. The network performs a proportional control action by\nencoding target, feedback, and error signals using a spiking relational\nnetwork. It continuously calculates the error through a connectivity pattern,\nwhich relates the three variables by means of feed-forward connections.\nRecurrent connections within each population are used to speed up the\nconvergence, decrease the effect of mismatch and improve selectivity. The\nneuromorphic motor controller is interfaced with the iCub robot simulator. We\ntested our spiking P controller in a single joint control task, specifically\nfor the robot head yaw. The spiking controller sends the target positions,\nreads the motor state from its encoder, and sends back the motor commands to\nthe joint. The performance of the spiking controller is tested in a step\nresponse experiment and in a target pursuit task. In this work, we optimize the\nnetwork structure to make it more robust to noisy inputs and device mismatch,\nwhich leads to better control performances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2020 14:17:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-05"}

However, obtaining a\ntight lower bound requires a sample size exponential in MI and thus a large set\nof negative samples. We can incorporate more samples by building a large\nqueue-based dictionary, but there are theoretical limits to performance\nimprovements even with a large number of negative samples. We hypothesize that\n\\textit{random negative sampling} leads to a highly redundant dictionary that\nresults in suboptimal representations for downstream tasks.

Optical sensors leveraging spectroscopy have a tremendous\npotential of providing an accurate, real time, and specialists-free AFM1\ndetector.

Here, we demonstrate an optical sensor that employs the\nprinciple of cavity attenuated phase shift spectroscopy in optical fiber\ncavities for rapid AFM1 detection in aqueous solutions at 1550 nm. The sensor\nconstitutes a cavity built by two fiber Bragg gratings. We splice a tapered\nfiber of $<$ 10 $\\mu$m waist inside the cavity as a sensing head. For ensuring\nspecific binding of AFM1 in a solution, the tapered fiber is functionalized\nwith DNA aptamers followed by validation of the conjugation via FTIR, TGA, and\nEDX analyses. We then detect AFM1 in a solution by measuring the phase shift\nbetween a sinusoidally modulated laser input and the sensor output at resonant\nfrequencies of the cavity. Our results show that the sensor has the detection\nlimit of 20 ng/L (20 ppt) which is well below both the US and the European\nsafety regulations.

Since nuclear safety analysis has\nimportant implications, a convincing validation process is needed to assess\nsimulation adequacy, i.e., the degree to which M&S tools can adequately\nrepresent the system quantities of interest. However, due to data gaps,\nvalidation becomes a decision-making process under uncertainties. Expert\nknowledge and judgments are required to collect, choose, characterize, and\nintegrate evidence toward the final adequacy decision. However, in validation\nframeworks CSAU: Code Scaling, Applicability, and Uncertainty (NUREG/CR-5249)\nand EMDAP: Evaluation Model Development and Assessment Process (RG 1.203), such\na decision-making process is largely implicit and obscure. When scenarios are\ncomplex, knowledge biases and unreliable judgments can be overlooked, which\ncould increase uncertainty in the simulation adequacy result and the\ncorresponding risks. Therefore, a framework is required to formalize the\ndecision-making process for simulation adequacy in a practical, transparent,\nand consistent manner. This paper suggests a framework \"Predictive Capability\nMaturity Quantification using Bayesian network (PCMQBN)\" as a quantified\nframework for assessing simulation adequacy based on information collected from\nvalidation activities. A case study is prepared for evaluating the adequacy of\na Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamic simulation in predicting the hydrodynamic\nforces onto static structures during an external flooding scenario. Comparing\nto the qualitative and implicit adequacy assessment, PCMQBN is able to improve\nconfidence in the simulation adequacy result and to reduce expected loss in the\nrisk-informed safety analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 17:09:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-08"}
