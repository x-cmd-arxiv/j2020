In this situation, the front locks to the interface of the\nheterogeneity leaving a long intermediate state lying near the unstable ground\nstate, possibly allowing for growth of perturbations. This manifests itself in\nthe spectrum of the linearization about the front through the accumulation of\neigenvalues onto the absolute spectrum associated with the unstable ground\nstate.

These discoveries reveal the\npossibility of building the MPT-based one-dimensional Ising Machine that can be\nused to simulate the complex phenomena of phase competition in strongly\ncorrelated systems and provide insights with its unambiguous exact solutions.\nThey also form a rich playground for exploring unconventional phase transitions\nin one-dimensional Heisenberg models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jun 2020 16:36:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 16 Aug 2020 15:08:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-18"}

In this paper, we introduce a novel\n\"end-to-end\" design for deep kernel map learning that balances the\napproximation quality of kernels and their discrimination power.

Recently,\nincreasing attention has been paid on graph neural networks (GNNs), which aim\nto model the local graph structures and capture the hierarchical patterns by\naggregating the information from neighbors with stackable network modules.\nMotivated by the observation that different nodes often require different\niterations of aggregation to fully capture the structural information, in this\npaper, we propose to explicitly sample diverse iterations of aggregation for\ndifferent nodes to boost the performance of GNNs. It is a challenging task to\ndevelop an effective aggregation strategy for each node, given complex graphs\nand sparse features.

We further introduce parameter sharing and a\nbuffer mechanism to boost the training efficiency.

The most deleterious ones are\nheavy weight, high bulk recombination, lack of photon confinement and an\nincrease of the heat absorption. The use of thinned Ge substrates is herein\nproposed as a possible solution to the aforementioned challenges. The potential\nof a thinned Ge subcell inside a standard GaInP/Ga(In)As/Ge triple-junction\nsolar cell is assessed by simulations, pointing to an optimum thickness around\n5-10 {\\mu}m. This would reduce the weight by more than 90 %, whereas the\navailable current for the Ge subcell would decrease only by 5 %. In addition,\nthe heat absorption for wavelengths beyond 1600 nm would decrease by more than\n85 %. The performance of such a device is highly influenced by the front and\nback surface recombination of the p-n junction. Simulations remark that good\nback surface passivation is mandatory to avoid losing power generation by\nthinning the substrate. In contrast, it has been found that front surface\nrecombination lowers the power generation in a similar manner for thin and\nthick solar cells. Therefore, the benefits of thinning the substrate are not\nlimited by the front surface recombination. Finally, Ge single-junction solar\ncells thinned down to 85 {\\mu}m by wet etching processes are demonstrated. The\nfeasibility of the thinning process is supported by the limited losses measured\nin the current generation (less than 6 %) and generated voltage (4 %) for the\nthinnest solar cell manufactured.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jun 2020 17:21:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-29"}

A\ncomplete spectroscopy of neutrinos from the {\\it pp} chain, producing about\n99\\% of the solar energy, has already been performed \\cite{bib:Nature-2018}.\nHere, we report the direct observation, with a high statistical significance,\nof neutrinos produced in the CNO cycle in the Sun.

Therefore, this result paves the way to a direct measurement of\nthe solar metallicity by CNO neutrinos.

The terrestrial exoplanets\nthat will be characterized with future infrared space telescopes orbit M dwarf\nstars. As a result, the best observable terrestrial exoplanets have vastly\ndifferent climates than Earth, with a large dayside-to-nightside irradiation\ncontrast and relatively slow rotation. Hurricanes may affect future\nobservations of terrestrial exoplanets because they enhance the vertical\ntransport of water vapor and could influence ocean heat transport. In this\nwork, we explore how the environment of terrestrial exoplanets orbiting M dwarf\nstars affects the favorability of hurricane genesis (formation). To do so, we\napply metrics developed to understand hurricane genesis on Earth to\nthree-dimensional climate models of ocean-covered exoplanets orbiting M dwarf\nstars. We find that hurricane genesis is most favorable on\nintermediate-rotating tidally locked terrestrial exoplanets with rotation\nperiods of $\\sim 8-10~\\mathrm{days}$. As a result, hurricane genesis is most\nfavorable for terrestrial exoplanets in the habitable zones of late-type M\ndwarf stars. The peak in the favorability of hurricane genesis at intermediate\nrotation occurs because sufficient spin is required for hurricane genesis, but\nthe vertical wind shear on fast-rotating terrestrial exoplanets disrupts\nhurricane genesis. We find that hurricane genesis is less favorable on slowly\nrotating terrestrial exoplanets, which agrees with previous work. Future work\nusing simulations that resolve hurricane genesis and evolution can test our\nexpectations for how the environment affects the favorability of hurricane\ngenesis on tidally locked terrestrial exoplanets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jun 2020 17:24:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-12"}

Furthermore, a tangled field should support the\npropagation of `magnetoelastic waves', the isotropic analogue of Alfv\\'en waves\non a straight magnetic field.

(Aims) In this work, we present a novel approach to MCRT that\naddresses the challenging memory access patterns of traditional MCRT\nalgorithms, which hinder optimal performance of MCRT simulations on modern\nhardware with a complex memory architecture. (Methods) We reformulate the MCRT\nphoton packet life cycle as a task-based algorithm, whereby the computation is\nbroken down into small tasks that are executed concurrently. Photon packets are\nstored in intermediate buffers, and tasks propagate photon packets through\nsmall parts of the computational domain, moving them from one buffer to another\nin the process. (Results) Using the implementation of the new algorithm in the\nphotoionization MCRT code CMacIonize 2.0, we show that the decomposition of the\nMCRT grid into small parts leads to a significant performance gain during the\nphoton packet propagation phase, which constitutes the bulk of an MCRT\nalgorithm, as a result of better usage of memory caches. Our new algorithm is a\nfactor 2 to 4 faster than an equivalent traditional algorithm and shows good\nstrong scaling up to 30 threads. We briefly discuss how our new algorithm could\nbe adjusted or extended to other astrophysical MCRT applications.

The timescales of these loss mechanisms are\nuncertain and there is a need for more observational constraints. In the inner\nmain belt, the mean size of the non-family asteroids increases with increasing\ninclination. Here, we use that observation to show that all inner main belt\nasteroids originate from either the known families or from ghost families, that\nis, old families with dispersed orbital elements. We estimate that the average\nage of the asteroids in the ghost families is a factor of 1/3 less than the\nYarkovsky orbital evolution timescale. However, this orbital evolution\ntimescale is a long-term average that must allow for the collisional evolution\nof the asteroids and for stochastic changes in their spin directions. By\napplying these constraints on the orbital evolution timescales to the evolution\nof the size-frequency distribution of the Vesta asteroid family, we estimate\nthat the age of this family is greater than 1.3 $Gyr$ and could be comparable\nwith the age of the solar system. By estimating the number of ghost families,\nwe calculate that the number of asteroids that are the root sources of the\nmeteorites and the near-Earth asteroids that originate from the inner main belt\nis about 20.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jun 2020 18:51:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 4 Apr 2021 19:34:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-26"}

Without\ndescription of how outputs are generated, a collaborating physician can neither\nresolve when the model's conclusions are in conflict with his or her own, nor\nlearn to anticipate model behavior. Current research aims to interpret networks\nthat diagnose ECG recordings, which has great potential impact as recordings\nbecome more personalized and widely deployed. A generalizable impact beyond\nECGs lies in the ability to provide a rich test-bed for the development of\ninterpretive techniques in medicine. Interpretive techniques for Deep Neural\nNetworks (DNNs), however, tend to be heuristic and observational in nature,\nlacking the mathematical rigor one might expect in the analysis of math\nequations. The motivation of this paper is to offer a third option, a\nscientific approach. We treat the model output itself as a phenomenon to be\nexplained through component parts and equations governing their behavior. We\nargue that these component parts should also be \"black boxes\" --additional\ntargets to interpret heuristically with clear functional connection to the\noriginal. We show how to rigorously factor a DNN into a hierarchical equation\nconsisting of black box variables. This is not a subdivision into physical\nparts, like an organism into its cells; it is but one choice of an equation\ninto a collection of abstract functions. Yet, for DNNs trained to identify\nnormal ECG waveforms on PhysioNet 2017 Challenge data, we demonstrate this\nchoice yields interpretable component models identified with visual composite\nsketches of ECG samples in corresponding input regions. Moreover, the recursion\ndistills this interpretation: additional factorization of component black boxes\ncorresponds to ECG partitions that are more morphologically pure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jun 2020 19:32:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-30"}

The vast majority of these functions will perform poorly on\nunseen data, and yet in practice DNNs often generalise remarkably well. This\nsuccess suggests that a trained DNN must have a strong inductive bias towards\nfunctions with low generalisation error. Here we empirically investigate this\ninductive bias by calculating, for a range of architectures and datasets, the\nprobability $P_{SGD}(f\\mid S)$ that an overparameterised DNN, trained with\nstochastic gradient descent (SGD) or one of its variants, converges on a\nfunction $f$ consistent with a training set $S$. We also use Gaussian processes\nto estimate the Bayesian posterior probability $P_B(f\\mid S)$ that the DNN\nexpresses $f$ upon random sampling of its parameters, conditioned on $S$.\n  Our main findings are that $P_{SGD}(f\\mid S)$ correlates remarkably well with\n$P_B(f\\mid S)$ and that $P_B(f\\mid S)$ is strongly biased towards low-error and\nlow complexity functions. These results imply that strong inductive bias in the\nparameter-function map (which determines $P_B(f\\mid S)$), rather than a special\nproperty of SGD, is the primary explanation for why DNNs generalise so well in\nthe overparameterised regime.\n  While our results suggest that the Bayesian posterior $P_B(f\\mid S)$ is the\nfirst order determinant of $P_{SGD}(f\\mid S)$, there remain second order\ndifferences that are sensitive to hyperparameter tuning. A function probability\npicture, based on $P_{SGD}(f\\mid S)$ and/or $P_B(f\\mid S)$, can shed new light\non the way that variations in architecture or hyperparameter settings such as\nbatch size, learning rate, and optimiser choice, affect DNN performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jun 2020 19:45:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 24 Oct 2020 13:28:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-13"}

However, existing OOD detection\nsolutions can be brittle in the open world, facing various types of adversarial\nOOD inputs. While methods leveraging auxiliary OOD data have emerged, our\nanalysis on illuminative examples reveals a key insight that the majority of\nauxiliary OOD examples may not meaningfully improve or even hurt the decision\nboundary of the OOD detector, which is also observed in empirical results on\nreal data. In this paper, we provide a theoretically motivated method,\nAdversarial Training with informative Outlier Mining (ATOM), which improves the\nrobustness of OOD detection. We show that, by mining informative auxiliary OOD\ndata, one can significantly improve OOD detection performance, and somewhat\nsurprisingly, generalize to unseen adversarial attacks. ATOM achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance under a broad family of classic and adversarial\nOOD evaluation tasks. For example, on the CIFAR-10 in-distribution dataset,\nATOM reduces the FPR (at TPR 95%) by up to 57.99% under adversarial OOD inputs,\nsurpassing the previous best baseline by a large margin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jun 2020 20:58:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 3 Oct 2020 23:30:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 22 Jun 2021 22:09:39 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2021 02:33:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-01"}

Second, can we devise an\nalternate computationally inexpensive model that retains the predictive power\nof the GNN architecture? We answer the first question in the negative, and\naddress the second question by proposing a new hybrid architecture for\nefficient branching on CPU machines.

The \\emph{reaction} core incorporates new\nobservations with input from the slow core to produce the agent's policy; the\n\\emph{perception} core accesses only short-term observations and informs the\nslow core; lastly, the \\emph{prediction} core accesses only long-term memory.\nAn auxiliary loss regularizes policies drawn from all three cores against each\nother, enacting the prior that the policy should be expressible from either\nrecent or long-term memory.

However, the sound\ndurations of sound events vary greatly depending on the sound event class,\ne.g., the sound event ``fan'' has a long time duration, while the sound event\n``mouse clicking'' is instantaneous. The difference in the time duration\nbetween sound event classes thus causes a serious data imbalance problem in\nSED. In this paper, we propose a method for SED using a duration robust loss\nfunction, which can focus model training on sound events of short duration. In\nthe proposed method, we focus on a relationship between the duration of the\nsound event and the ease/difficulty of model training. In particular, many\nsound events of long duration (e.g., sound event ``fan'') are stationary\nsounds, which have less variation in their acoustic features and their model\ntraining is easy. Meanwhile, some sound events of short duration (e.g., sound\nevent ``object impact'') have more than one audio pattern, such as attack,\ndecay, and release parts.

Herein, we propose a novel method, Smile-GANs (SeMi-supervIsed\ncLustEring via GANs), for semi-supervised clustering, and apply it to brain MRI\nscans. Smile-GANs first learns multiple distinct mappings by generating PT from\nCN, with each mapping characterizing one relatively distinct pathological\npattern.

However, the inverse design of metamaterial and its multiscale\nsystem is challenging due to high-dimensional topological design space,\nmultiple local optima, and high computational cost. To address these hurdles,\nwe propose a novel data-driven metamaterial design framework based on deep\ngenerative modeling. A variational autoencoder (VAE) and a regressor for\nproperty prediction are simultaneously trained on a large metamaterial database\nto map complex microstructures into a low-dimensional, continuous, and\norganized latent space. We show in this study that the latent space of VAE\nprovides a distance metric to measure shape similarity, enable interpolation\nbetween microstructures and encode meaningful patterns of variation in\ngeometries and properties. Based on these insights, systematic data-driven\nmethods are proposed for the design of microstructure, graded family, and\nmultiscale system. For microstructure design, the tuning of mechanical\nproperties and complex manipulations of microstructures are easily achieved by\nsimple vector operations in the latent space. The vector operation is further\nextended to generate metamaterial families with a controlled gradation of\nmechanical properties by searching on a constructed graph model. For multiscale\nmetamaterial systems design, a diverse set of microstructures can be rapidly\ngenerated using VAE for target properties at different locations and then\nassembled by an efficient graph-based optimization method to ensure\ncompatibility between adjacent microstructures.

The mass of oxygen lost\nfrom each galaxy is calculated by comparing the existing oxygen in gas and\nstars in the galaxy to the oxygen that should have been produced by the\npresent-day population of stars.

We\nfocus on two federally regulated pollutants, nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and fine\nparticulate matter (PM2.5). Observed concentrations at all available ground\nmonitoring sites (240 and 480 for NO2 and PM2.5, respectively) were compared\nbetween April 2020 and April of the prior five years, 2015-2019, as the\nbaseline.

The second goal of this study is to explain the different responses\nof the two pollutants during the COVID-19 pandemic. The hypothesis put forward\nis that the shelter-in-place measures affected peoples' driving patterns most\ndramatically, thus passenger vehicle NO2 emissions were reduced. Commercial\nvehicles and electricity demand for all purposes remained relatively unchanged,\nthus PM2.5 concentrations did not drop significantly. To establish a\ncorrelation between the observed NO2 changes and the extent to which people\nwere sheltering in place, we use a mobility index, which was produced and made\npublic by Descartes Labs. This mobility index aggregates cell phone usage at\nthe county level to capture changes in human movement over time.

Traditional\napproaches to community detection involve modularity-based algorithms, which\ngenerally speaking, construct partitions based on heuristics that seek to\nmaximize the ratio of the edges within the partitions to those between them. On\nthe other hand, node embedding approaches represent each node in a graph as a\nreal-valued vector and is thereby able to transform the problem of community\ndetection in a graph to that of clustering a set of vectors. Existing node\nembedding approaches are primarily based on, first, initiating random walks\nfrom each node to construct a context of a node, and then make the vector\nrepresentation of a node close to its context. However, standard node embedding\napproaches do not directly take into account the community structure of a\nnetwork while constructing the context around each node. To alleviate this, we\nexplore two different threads of work. First, we investigate the use of maximum\nentropy-based random walks to obtain more centrality preserving embedding of\nnodes, which may lead to more effective clusters in the embedded space. Second,\nwe propose a community structure-aware node embedding approach, where we\nincorporate modularity-based partitioning heuristics into the objective\nfunction of node embedding. We demonstrate that our proposed combination of the\ncombinatorial and the embedding approaches for community detection outperforms\na number of modularity-based baselines and K-means clustering on a standard\nnode-embedded (node2vec) vector space on a wide range of real-life and\nsynthetic networks of different sizes and densities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Jun 2020 08:07:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-30"}

In our model, the jitter\nradiative spectral index is determined by the spectral index of the turbulence.\nWe classify GRBs into three classes depending on the shape of the GRB\nhigh-energy spectrum when we compare the GBM and LAT detections: the GRB\nspectrum is concave (GRBs turn out to be softer and are labeled as S-GRBs), the\nGRB spectrum is convex (GRBs turn out to be harder and are labeled as H-GRBs),\nand the GRBs have no strong spectral changes (labeled as N-GRBs).

Furthermore, we show that vacuum and thermal\nfluctuations can significantly wash out the interference contrast, seen in the\nmean-field approaches, due to shot-to-shot fluctuations in the position of\ninterference fringes around the mean.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Jun 2020 09:35:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Aug 2020 09:34:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 25 Aug 2020 22:05:17 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2020 07:25:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-04"}

However, amongst online\npractical scenarios where the features are evolving (e.g., some features are\nvanished and some new features are augmented), most metric learning models\ncannot be successfully applied to these scenarios, although they can tackle the\nevolving instances efficiently. To address the challenge, we develop a new\nonline Evolving Metric Learning (EML) model for incremental and decremental\nfeatures, which can handle the instance and feature evolutions simultaneously\nby incorporating with a smoothed Wasserstein metric distance. Specifically, our\nmodel contains two essential stages: a Transforming stage (T-stage) and a\nInheriting stage (I-stage). For the T-stage, we propose to extract important\ninformation from vanished features while neglecting non-informative knowledge,\nand forward it into survived features by transforming them into a low-rank\ndiscriminative metric space. It further explores the intrinsic low-rank\nstructure of heterogeneous samples to reduce the computation and memory burden\nespecially for highly-dimensional large-scale data. For the I-stage, we inherit\nthe metric performance of survived features from the T-stage and then expand to\ninclude the new augmented features. Moreover, a smoothed Wasserstein distance\nis utilized to characterize the similarity relationships among the\nheterogeneous and complex samples, since the evolving features are not strictly\naligned in the different stages.

Recently, deep learning has emerged as an effective\napproach to monocular depth estimation. As obtaining labeled data is costly,\nthere is a recent trend to move from supervised learning to unsupervised\nlearning to obtain monocular depth. However, most unsupervised learning methods\ncapable of achieving high depth prediction accuracy will require a deep network\narchitecture which will be too heavy and complex to run on embedded devices\nwith limited storage and memory spaces. To address this issue, we propose a new\npowerful network with a recurrent module to achieve the capability of a deep\nnetwork while at the same time maintaining an extremely lightweight size for\nreal-time high performance unsupervised monocular depth prediction from video\nsequences. Besides, a novel efficient upsample block is proposed to fuse the\nfeatures from the associated encoder layer and recover the spatial size of\nfeatures with the small number of model parameters.

It is well-known that following the supervised\nlearning paradigm may lead to the overfitting of training data, and the lack of\nsupervision information of PolSAR images undoubtedly aggravates this problem,\nwhich greatly affects the generalization performance of CNN-based classifiers\nin large-scale applications. To handle this problem, in this paper, learning\ntransferrable representations from unlabeled PolSAR data through convolutional\narchitectures is explored for the first time.

While the charged- and neutral-pion couplings to protons and neutrons\nare expected to be very similar, owing to the approximate isospin symmetry of\nthe strong interaction, the different masses of the up- and down-quarks and\nelectromagnetic effects may result in their slightly different values. Despite\nprevious attempts to extract these coupling constants from different systems,\nour knowledge of their values is still deficient. In this Letter we present a\nprecision determination of these fundamental observables with fully controlled\nuncertainties from neutron-proton and proton-proton scattering data using\nchiral effective field theory.

This can be achieved via the water-splitting\nprocess exploiting solar energy but requiring the use of adequate\nphotocatalysts. Covalent triazine-based frameworks (CTFs) are target\nphotocatalysts for water-splitting. Both electronic and structural\ncharacteristics of CTFs, optical bandgaps and porosity, are directly relevant\nfor water-splitting. These can be engineered through chemical design. Porosity\ncan be beneficial to water-splitting by providing larger surface area for the\ncatalytic reactions. However, porosity can also affect both charge transport\nwithin the photocatalyst and mass transfer of both reactants and products, thus\nimpacting the overall kinetics of the reaction. We focus on the link between\nchemical design and water (reactants) mass transfer, playing a key role in the\nwater uptake process and the subsequent hydrogen generation. We use neutron\nspectroscopy to study water mass transfer in two porous CTFs, CTF-CN and CTF-2,\nthat differ in the polarity of their struts. Quasi-elastic neutron scattering\n(QENS) is used to quantify the amount of bound water and the translational\ndiffusion of water. Inelastic neutron scattering measurements complement QENS\nand provides insights into the softness of the CTF structures and the changes\nin librational degrees of freedom of water in CTFs. We show that CTF-CN\nexhibits smaller surface area and water uptake due to a softer structure than\nCTF-2. The current study leads to new insights into the\nstructure-dynamics-property relationship of CTF photo-catalysts that pave the\nroad for a better understanding of the guest-host interaction at the basis of\nwater splitting applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Jun 2020 13:26:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Feb 2021 11:05:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-24"}

In this paper, we propose a stereo matching method, called\nMTStereo 2.0, for limited-resource systems that require efficient and accurate\ndepth estimation. It is based on a Max-tree hierarchical representation of\nimage pairs, which we use to identify matching regions along image scan-lines.\nThe method includes a cost function that considers similarity of region\ncontextual information based on the Max-trees and a disparity border preserving\ncost aggregation approach.

These refer to different momentum scales in\nthe propagator and are related by $M^2_h\\sim m^2_h \\ln (\\Lambda_s/M_h)$, where\n$\\Lambda_s$ is the ultraviolet cutoff of the scalar sector. We have checked\nthis two-scale structure with lattice simulations of the propagator and of the\nsusceptibility in the 4D Ising limit of the theory. These indicate that, in a\ncutoff theory where both $m_h$ and $M_h$ are finite, by increasing the energy,\nthere could be a transition from a relatively low value, e.g. $m_h$=125 GeV, to\na much larger $M_h$. The same lattice data give a final estimate $M_h= 720 \\pm\n30 $ GeV which induces to re-consider the experimental situation at LHC. In\nparticular an independent analysis of the ATLAS + CMS data indicating an excess\nin the 4-lepton channel as if there were a new scalar resonance around 700 GeV.\nFinally, the presence of two vastly different mass scales, requiring an\ninterpolating form for the Higgs field propagator also in loop corrections,\ncould reduce the discrepancy with those precise measurements which still favor\nlarge values of the Higgs particle mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Jun 2020 15:02:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

The virus transmits rapidly; it has\na basic reproductive number R of 2.2-2.7. In March 2020, the World Health\nOrganization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic. COVID-19 is currently\naffecting more than 200 countries with 6M active cases. An effective testing\nstrategy for COVID-19 is crucial to controlling the outbreak but the demand for\ntesting surpasses the availability of test kits that use Reverse Transcription\nPolymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). In this paper, we present a technique to\nscreen for COVID-19 using artificial intelligence. Our technique takes only\nseconds to screen for the presence of the virus in a patient. We collected a\ndataset of chest X-ray images and trained several popular deep convolution\nneural network-based models (VGG, MobileNet, Xception, DenseNet,\nInceptionResNet) to classify the chest X-rays. Unsatisfied with these models,\nwe then designed and built a Residual Attention Network that was able to screen\nCOVID-19 with a testing accuracy of 98% and a validation accuracy of 100%. A\nfeature maps visual of our model show areas in a chest X-ray which are\nimportant for classification. Our work can help to increase the adaptation of\nAI-assisted applications in clinical practice.

In this study, we propose a simple\nnumerical model comprising a set of coupled double quantum dots, where the\ndisconnection of the elements is represented by the removal of Coulomb\ninteraction between the quantum dots, for the quantitative investigation of\nintegrated information. As a measure of integrated information, we calculate\nthe mutual information in the model system, as the Kullback-Leibler divergence\nbetween the connected and disconnected status, through the probability\ndistribution of the electronic states from the master transition-rate\nequations. We reasonably demonstrate that the increase in the strength of\ninteraction between the quantum dots leads to higher mutual information, owing\nto the larger divergence in the probability distributions of the electronic\nstates. Our model setup could be a useful basic tool for numerical analyses in\nthe field of integrated information theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Jun 2020 05:18:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 22 Aug 2020 11:57:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-30"}

Our simulation approach consists of a finite element spatial\ndiscretization of the fully-coupled nonlinear system of partial differential\nequations at the microscale, which is treated implicitly in time with a\npreconditioned Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov method. The approach allows time\nsteps larger than those restricted by the traditional explicit CFL limit and is\nalgorithmically scalable as well as efficient due to an effective\npreconditioning strategy based on algebraic multigrid and block factorization.\nWe implement this approach in the open-source Tusas framework, which is a\ngeneral, flexible tool developed in C++ for solving coupled systems of\nnonlinear partial differential equations. The performance of our approach is\nanalyzed in terms of algorithmic scalability and efficiency, while the\ncomputational performance of Tusas is presented in terms of parallel\nscalability and efficiency on emerging heterogeneous architectures. We\ndemonstrate that modern algorithms, discretizations, and computational science,\nand heterogeneous hardware provide a robust route for predictive phase-field\nsimulation of microstructure evolution during additive manufacturing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Jun 2020 05:19:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Sep 2021 03:21:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-05"}

However, building a robust image classification\nmodel for datasets with data irregularity or imbalanced classes can be a very\nchallenging task, especially in the medical imaging domain. In this paper, we\npropose a novel deep convolutional neural network, we called Self Supervised\nSuper Sample Decomposition for Transfer learning (4S-DT) model. 4S-DT\nencourages a coarse-to-fine transfer learning from large-scale image\nrecognition tasks to a specific chest X-ray image classification task using a\ngeneric self-supervised sample decomposition approach. Our main contribution is\na novel self-supervised learning mechanism guided by a super sample\ndecomposition of unlabelled chest X-ray images. 4S-DT helps in improving the\nrobustness of knowledge transformation via a downstream learning strategy with\na class-decomposition layer to simplify the local structure of the data. 4S-DT\ncan deal with any irregularities in the image dataset by investigating its\nclass boundaries using a downstream class-decomposition mechanism. We used\n50,000 unlabelled chest X-ray images to achieve our coarse-to-fine transfer\nlearning with an application to COVID-19 detection, as an exemplar. 4S-DT has\nachieved a high accuracy of 99.8% (95% CI: 99.44%, 99.98%) in the detection of\nCOVID-19 cases on a large dataset and an accuracy of 97.54% (95%$ CI: 96.22%,\n98.91%) on an extended test set enriched by augmented images of a small\ndataset, out of which all real COVID-19 cases were detected, which was the\nhighest accuracy obtained when compared to other methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jun 2020 16:09:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2020 17:29:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-16"}

However, experimental identification\nof E3 target relationships is not an easy task due to the labor-intensive\nnature of the experiments. In this article, a sequence-based E3-target\nprediction model is proposed for the first time. The proposed framework\nutilizes composition of k-spaced amino acid pairs (CKSAAP) to learn the\nrelationship between E3 ligases and their target protein. A class separable\nlatent space encoding scheme is also devised that provides a compressed\nrepresentation of feature space. A thorough ablation study is performed to\nidentify an optimal gap size for CKSAAP and the number of latent variables that\ncan represent the E3-target relationship successfully. The proposed scheme is\nevaluated on an independent dataset for a variety of standard quantitative\nmeasures. In particular, it achieves an average accuracy of $70.63\\%$ on an\nindependent dataset.
