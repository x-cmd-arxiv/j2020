Two techniques are\ndiscussed, including the QUICKEST scheme of Leonard. Discussions are given on\nhow the QUICK scheme is mistakenly found to be second-order accurate.

This is due, in part, to V18's more precise\nmeasurements of planet radius $R_p$.

This UAV falls in the category of\nmultirotors with tilt-motion enabled rotors. Since the vehicle considered is\nover-actuated in nature, the dynamics and control allocation have to be\nanalysed carefully. Moreover, the possibility of hovering at large attitude\nmaneuvers of this novel vehicle requires singularity-free attitude control.\nHence, quaternion state feedback is utilized to compute the control commands\nfor the UAV motors while avoiding the gimbal lock condition experienced by\nEuler angle based controllers. The quaternion implementation also reduces the\noverall complexity of state estimation due to absence of trigonometric\nparameters. The quadcopter dynamic model and state space is utilized to design\nthe attitude controller and control allocation for the UAV. The control\nallocation, in particular, is derived by linearizing the system about hover\ncondition. This mathematical method renders the control allocation more\naccurate than existing approaches. Lyapunov stability analysis of the attitude\ncontroller is shown to prove global stability. The quaternion feedback attitude\ncontroller is commanded by an outer position controller loop which generates\nrotor-tilt and desired quaternions commands for the system. The performance of\nthe UAV is evaluated by numerical simulations for tracking attitude step\ncommands and for following a way-point navigation mission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Jun 2020 19:40:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-30"}

MARS has\nalso been employed to approxmiate unknown relationships in optimzation for\ncomplex systems, including surrogate optimization, dynamic programming, and\ntwo-stage stochastic programming. Given the increasing desire to optimize real\nworld systems, this paper presents an approach to globally optimize a MARS\nmodel that allows up to two-way interaction terms that are products of\ntruncated linear univariate functions (TITL-MARS). Specifally, such a MARS\nmodel consists of linear and quadratic structure. This structure is exploited\nto formulate a mixed integer quadratic programming problem (TITL-MARS-OPT). To\nappreciate the contribution of TITL-MARS-OPT, one must recognize that popular\nheurstic optimization approaches, such as evolutionary algorithms, do not\nguarantee global optimality and can be computationally slow. The use of MARS\nmaintains the flexibility of modeling within TITL-MARS-OPT while also taking\nadvantage of the linear modeling structure of MARS to enable global optimality.\nComputational results compare TITL-MARS-OPT with a genetic algorithm for two\ntypes of cases.

The former might be problematic if the minimal relevant effect is\nclose to the null, thus requiring an excessively large sample size. The latter\nis dubious since it does not account for the a priori uncertainty about the\nlikely alternative effect size.

With customer subscriptions in mind, we can\napply the use of churn prediction to not only predict whether a customer will\nunsubscribe from the service but explore the user's playing behavior to obtain\nmore insight into user playing patterns. The churn problem is somewhat complex\ndue to the nature of not having a one size fits all solution, as different\nservices define churn in a variety of ways. In this paper, we explore a dataset\nthat focuses on one year from January 1, 2008, until December 31, 2008, as it\nhighlights the release of a major content update in the game. Machine learning\nis used in two aspects of this paper: Survival Analysis and Binary\nClassification. Firstly, we explore the dataset using the Kaplan Meier\nestimator to predict the duration until a customer churns, and lastly predict\nwhether a person will churn in six months using traditional machine learning\nalgorithms such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, KNN Classifier,\nand Random Forests. From the survival analysis results, WoW customers have a\nrelatively long duration until churn, which solidifies the addictiveness of the\ngame.

When\nstrategic data sources have private market information, a fundamental economic\nchallenge is how to incentivize them to acquire fresh data and optimize the\nage-related performance. In this work, we consider an information update system\nin which a destination acquires, and pays for, fresh data updates from multiple\nsources. The destination incurs an age-related cost, modeled as a general\nincreasing function of the AoI. Each source is strategic and incurs a sampling\ncost, which is its private information and may not be truthfully reported to\nthe destination. The destination decides on the price of updates, when to get\nthem, and who should generate them, based on the sources' reported sampling\ncosts. We show that a benchmark that naively trusts the sources' reports can\nlead to an arbitrarily bad outcome compared to the case where sources\ntruthfully report. To tackle this issue, we design an optimal (economic)\nmechanism for timely information acquisition following Myerson's seminal work.\nTo this end, our proposed optimal mechanism minimizes the sum of the\ndestination's age-related cost and its payment to the sources, while ensuring\nthat the sources truthfully report their private information and will\nvoluntarily participate in the mechanism. However, finding the optimal\nmechanisms may suffer from \\textit{prohibitively expensive computational\noverheads} as it involves solving a nonlinear infinite-dimensional optimization\nproblem.

In this work, we present confidence-rich\nmapping (CRM), a new algorithm for spatial grid-based mapping of the 3D\nenvironment. CRM augments the occupancy level at each voxel by its confidence\nvalue. By explicitly storing and evolving confidence values using the CRM\nfilter, CRM extends traditional grid mapping in three ways: first, it partially\nmaintains the probabilistic dependence among voxels. Second, it relaxes the\nneed for hand-engineering an inverse sensor model and proposes the concept of\nsensor cause model that can be derived in a principled manner from the forward\nsensor model. Third, and most importantly, it provides consistent confidence\nvalues over the occupancy estimation that can be reliably used in collision\nrisk evaluation and motion planning. CRM runs online and enables mapping\nenvironments where voxels might be partially occupied. We demonstrate the\nperformance of the method on various datasets and environments in simulation\nand on physical systems. We show in real-world experiments that, in addition to\nachieving maps that are more accurate than traditional methods, the proposed\nfiltering scheme demonstrates a much higher level of consistency between its\nerror and the reported confidence, hence, enabling a more reliable collision\nrisk evaluation for motion planning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2020 00:21:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-30"}

Then, a distributed noncooperative medium\naccess control game is formulated in which each device optimizes its waiting\nrate so as to minimize its average AoI or average peak AoI under an average\nenergy cost constraint on channel sensing and packet transmitting.

We first show that only 35\\% of the predicted labels of a deep\nlearning model's snapshots near its convergence were exactly the same. The\ndisagreement between snapshots is non-negligible. From the perspective of\nmultiview learning, the snapshots together serve as a good committee to\nevaluate the importance of unlabeled instances. Using the snapshots committee\nto give out the informativeness of unlabeled data, the proposed AEDL achieved\nbetter performance on two real PolSAR images compared with standard active\nlearning strategies. It achieved the same classification accuracy with only 86%\nand 55% of the training samples compared with breaking ties active learning and\nrandom selection for the Flevoland dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2020 01:40:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-08"}

However, there is no\nconsensus on what types of galaxies likely host CR-driven winds, or what role\nthese winds might play in regulating galaxies' star formation rates. Using a\ndetailed treatment of the transport and losses of hadronic CRs developed in the\nprevious paper in this series, here we develop a semi-analytic model that\nallows us to assess the viability of using CRs to launch cool winds from\ngalactic discs. In particular, we determine the critical CR fluxes -- and\ncorresponding star formation rate surface densities -- above which hydrostatic\nequilibrium within a given galaxy is precluded because CRs drive the gas off in\na wind or otherwise render it unstable. We show that, for star-forming galaxies\nwith lower gas surface densities typical of the Galaxy and local dwarfs, the\nlocus of this CR stability curve patrols the high side of the observed\ndistribution of galaxies in the Kennicutt-Schmidt parameter space of star\nformation rate versus gas surface density. However, hadronic losses render CRs\nunable to drive winds in galaxies with higher surface densities. Our results\nshow that quiescent, low surface density galaxies like the Milky Way are poised\non the cusp of instability, such that small changes to ISM parameters can lead\nto the launching of CR-driven outflows, and we suggest that, as a result, CR\nfeedback sets an ultimate limit to the star formation efficiency of most modern\ngalaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2020 05:57:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2020 04:33:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-03"}

However, the standard\nNewton-Raphson method used in the PMQ algorithm suffers from numerical\ninstabilities, inhibiting widespread adoption, especially for use in\ncalibration. By directly specifying the random variable to be quantized at each\ntime step, we show that PMQ, and RMQ in one dimension, can be expressed as\nstandard vector quantization.

First, the\nheterogeneity of platforms, protocols, software, and hardware exposes various\nvulnerabilities. Second, in addition to the traditional high-rate attacks, the\nlow-rate attacks are also extensively used by IoT attackers to obfuscate the\nlegitimate and malicious traffic.

The UAV's flight trajectory and scheduling of status updates are\njointly optimized with the objective of minimizing the normalized weighted sum\nof Age of Information (NWAoI) values for different physical processes at the\nUAV. The problem is first formulated as a mixed-integer program. Then, for a\ngiven scheduling policy, a convex optimization-based solution is proposed to\nderive the UAV's optimal flight trajectory and time instants on updates.\nHowever, finding the optimal scheduling policy is challenging due to the\ncombinatorial nature of the formulated problem. Therefore, to complement the\nproposed convex optimization-based solution, a finite-horizon Markov decision\nprocess (MDP) is used to find the optimal scheduling policy. Since the state\nspace of the MDP is extremely large, a novel neural combinatorial-based deep\nreinforcement learning (NCRL) algorithm using deep Q-network (DQN) is proposed\nto obtain the optimal policy. However, for large-scale scenarios with numerous\nnodes, the DQN architecture cannot efficiently learn the optimal scheduling\npolicy anymore. Motivated by this, a long short-term memory (LSTM)-based\nautoencoder is proposed to map the state space to a fixed-size vector\nrepresentation in such large-scale scenarios. A lower bound on the minimum\nNWAoI is analytically derived which provides system design guidelines on the\nappropriate choice of importance weights for different nodes. The numerical\nresults also demonstrate that the proposed NCRL approach can significantly\nimprove the achievable NWAoI per process compared to the baseline policies,\nsuch as weight-based and discretized state DQN policies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2020 08:23:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-30"}

Selection bias might bring the unexpected\ncorrelation between features and ignoring those unexpected correlations will\nhurt the performance of clustering algorithms. Therefore, how to remove those\nunexpected correlations induced by selection bias is extremely important yet\nlargely unexplored for clustering. In this paper, we propose a novel\nDecorrelation regularized K-Means algorithm (DCKM) for clustering with data\nselection bias. Specifically, the decorrelation regularizer aims to learn the\nglobal sample weights which are capable of balancing the sample distribution,\nso as to remove unexpected correlations among features. Meanwhile, the learned\nweights are combined with k-means, which makes the reweighted k-means cluster\non the inherent data distribution without unexpected correlation influence.\nMoreover, we derive the updating rules to effectively infer the parameters in\nDCKM. Extensive experiments results on real world datasets well demonstrate\nthat our DCKM algorithm achieves significant performance gains, indicating the\nnecessity of removing unexpected feature correlations induced by selection bias\nwhen clustering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2020 08:55:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Jul 2020 15:04:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-03"}

Several recent attacks have been able\nto infer sensitive information from trained models, including model inversion\nor attribute inference attacks. These attacks are able to reveal the values of\ncertain sensitive features of individuals who participated in training the\nmodel. It has also been shown that several factors can contribute to an\nincreased risk of model inversion, including feature influence. We observe that\nnot all features necessarily share the same level of privacy or sensitivity. In\nmany cases, certain features used to train a model are considered especially\nsensitive and therefore propitious candidates for inversion. We present a\nsolution for countering model inversion attacks in tree-based models, by\nreducing the influence of sensitive features in these models. This is an avenue\nthat has not yet been thoroughly investigated, with only very nascent previous\nattempts at using this as a countermeasure against attribute inference. Our\nwork shows that, in many cases, it is possible to train a model in different\nways, resulting in different influence levels of the various features, without\nnecessarily harming the model's accuracy. We are able to utilize this fact to\ntrain models in a manner that reduces the model's reliance on the most\nsensitive features, while increasing the importance of less sensitive features.\nOur evaluation confirms that training models in this manner reduces the risk of\ninference for those features, as demonstrated through several black-box and\nwhite-box attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2020 09:02:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-30"}

Implicit in such practices is the\nassumption that it is the underlying latent, rather than the indicators, that\nis causally efficacious. The assumption that the indicators do not have effects\non anything subsequent, and that they are themselves only affected by\nantecedents through the underlying latent is a strong assumption, effectively\nimposing a structural interpretation on the latent factor model.

However, the relative variability is significantly\nlow in the photospheric emission compared with that in the jet power. If the\n$\\eta$ is genetic variable, the variability of the photospheric emission is not\nonly limited by the jet power but also affected by $\\eta$ strongly. It becomes\ncomplex and is generally different from that of the jet power. Moreover, the\nopposite phase may stand in the variabilities of the photospheric emission at\ndifferent photon energies.

Hence, it may\nprovide a good example of a quantum fluid naturally suited to studies of\nacoustic Hawking radiation.

The Solar System tests put tight constraints on the theory.\nIn order to evade these constraints, various screening mechanisms have been\nproposed. These screening mechanisms allow the scalar field to couple to matter\nas strongly as gravity in low density environments while suppressing it in the\nSolar System. The Vainshtein mechanism, which is found in various modified\ngravity models such as massive gravity, braneworld models and scalar tensor\ntheories, suppresses the scalar field efficiently in the vicinity of a massive\nobject. This makes it difficult to test these theories from gravitational wave\nobservations. We point out that the recently found scalar gravitational wave\nmemory effect, which is caused by a permanent change in spacetime geometry due\nto the collapse of a star to a back hole can be significantly enhanced in the\nBrans-Dicke theory of gravity with the Vainshtein mechanism.

This is partly due to data\nbeing in insufficient quantities hurting the training of the models. To address\nthis issue, data from multiple health actors or patients could be combined by\ncapitalizing on their heterogeneity through the use of transfer learning.\n  To improve the quality of the transfer between multiple sources of data, we\npropose a multi-source adversarial transfer learning framework that enables the\nlearning of a feature representation that is similar across the sources, and\nthus more general and more easily transferable. We apply this idea to glucose\nforecasting for diabetic people using a fully convolutional neural network. The\nevaluation is done by exploring various transfer scenarios with three datasets\ncharacterized by their high inter and intra variability.\n  While transferring knowledge is beneficial in general, we show that the\nstatistical and clinical accuracies can be further improved by using of the\nadversarial training methodology, surpassing the current state-of-the-art\nresults. In particular, it shines when using data from different datasets, or\nwhen there is too little data in an intra-dataset situation. To understand the\nbehavior of the models, we analyze the learnt feature representations and\npropose a new metric in this regard. Contrary to a standard transfer, the\nadversarial transfer does not discriminate the patients and datasets, helping\nthe learning of a more general feature representation.\n  The adversarial training framework improves the learning of a general feature\nrepresentation in a multi-source environment, enhancing the knowledge transfer\nto an unseen target.\n  The proposed method can help improve the efficiency of data shared by\ndifferent health actors in the training of deep models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2020 11:17:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-30"}

In particular, the security analyses determines\nthe key-rate, i.e., the amount of cryptographic key material that can be\ndistributed per time unit. Nowadays, the security analyses of various QKD\nprotocols are well understood. It is known that optimal protocol parameters,\nsuch as the number of decoy states and their intensities, can be found by\nsolving a nonlinear optimization problem. The complexity of this optimization\nproblem is typically handled by making an number of heuristic assumptions. For\ninstance, the number of decoy states is restricted to only one or two, with one\nof the decoy intensities set to a fixed value, and vacuum states are ignored as\nthey are assumed to contribute only marginally to the secure key-rate. These\nassumptions simplify the optimization problem and reduce the size of search\nspace significantly. However, they also cause the security analysis to be\nnon-tight, and thereby result in sub-optimal performance.\n  In this work, we follow a more rigorous approach using both linear and\nnon-linear programs describing the optimization problem. Our approach, focusing\non the Decoy-State BB84 protocol, allows heuristic assumptions to be omitted,\nand therefore results in a tighter security analysis with better protocol\nparameters. We show an improved performance for the Decoy-State BB84 QKD\nprotocol, demonstrating that the heuristic assumptions typically made are too\nrestrictive.

We consider two\ntypes of repetitions in 2D-strings: 2D-runs and quartics (quartics are a\n2D-version of squares in standard strings). Amir et al. introduced 2D-runs,\nshowed that there are $O(n^3)$ of them in an $n \\times n$ 2D-string and\npresented a simple construction giving a lower bound of $\\Omega(n^2)$ for their\nnumber (TCS 2020). We make a significant step towards closing the gap between\nthese bounds by showing that the number of 2D-runs in an $n \\times n$ 2D-string\nis $O(n^2 \\log^2 n)$. In particular, our bound implies that the $O(n^2\\log n +\n\\textsf{output})$ run-time of the algorithm of Amir et al. for computing\n2D-runs is also $O(n^2 \\log^2 n)$. We expect this result to allow for\nexploiting 2D-runs algorithmically in the area of 2D pattern matching.\n  A quartic is a 2D-string composed of $2 \\times 2$ identical blocks\n(2D-strings) that was introduced by Apostolico and Brimkov (TCS 2000), where by\nquartics they meant only primitively rooted quartics, i.e. built of a primitive\nblock.

Apostolico and Brimkov showed that there are $O(n^2\n\\log^2 n)$ occurrences of primitively rooted quartics in an $n \\times n$\n2D-string and that this bound is attainable. Consequently the number of\ndistinct primitively rooted quartics is $O(n^2 \\log^2 n)$. Here, we prove that\nthe number of distinct general quartics is also $O(n^2 \\log^2 n)$. This extends\nthe rich combinatorial study of the number of distinct squares in a 1D-string,\nthat was initiated by Fraenkel and Simpson (J. Comb.

In contrast to a\ntraditional graphics pipeline, our approach does not require to specify all\nscene properties, such as material parameters and lighting by hand. Instead, we\nlearn photo-realistic deferred rendering from a small set of 3D models and a\nlarger set of unaligned real images, both of which are easy to acquire in\npractice. Simultaneously, we obtain accurate intrinsic decompositions of real\nimages while not requiring paired ground truth. Our experiments confirm that a\njoint treatment of rendering and decomposition is indeed beneficial and that\nour approach outperforms state-of-the-art image-to-image translation baselines\nboth qualitatively and quantitatively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2020 12:53:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2020 07:45:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 29 Mar 2021 10:27:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-30"}

Large globular clusters and nuclear star clusters, with relaxation\ntimescales of the order of a Hubble time, are small enough to display some\ncollisional behaviour and big enough to be impossible to simulate with direct\n$N$-body codes and current hardware. We introduce a new method to simulate\ncollisional stellar systems, and validate it by comparison with direct $N$-body\ncodes on small-$N$ simulations.

The code complexity scales with $N \\log\nN$ in the number of particles.

In this paper, with an application to\nan environmental restoration problem, a continuous-time stochastic impulse\ncontrol problem subject to execution delay under discrete and random\nobservations is newly formulated and analyzed. The dynamics have a non-smooth\ncoefficient modulated by a Markov chain, and eventually attain an undesirable\nstate like a depletion due to the non-smoothness.

These high-confidence errors can\nrepresent costly mistakes, and therefore should be explicitly searched for.\nPast works have developed search techniques to find classification errors above\na specified confidence threshold, but ignore the fact that errors should be\nexpected at confidence levels anywhere below 100\\%. In this work, we\ninvestigate the problem of finding errors at rates greater than expected given\nmodel confidence. Additionally, we propose a query-efficient and novel search\ntechnique that is guided by adversarial perturbations to find these mistakes in\nblack box models. Through rigorous empirical experimentation, we demonstrate\nthat our Adversarial Distance search discovers high-confidence errors at a rate\ngreater than expected given model confidence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2020 13:44:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-30"}

This paper studies the impact\nof Side Information (SI) on the performance of distortion-based real-time\nprivacy-preserving algorithms for SMs. In particular, we consider a deep\nadversarial learning framework, in which the desired releaser (a recurrent\nneural network) is trained by fighting against an adversary network until\nconvergence. To define the loss functions, two different approaches are\nconsidered: the Causal Adversarial Learning (CAL) and the Directed Information\n(DI)-based learning. The main difference between these approaches is in how the\nprivacy term is measured during the training process. On the one hand, the\nreleaser in the CAL method, by getting supervision from the actual values of\nthe private variables and feedback from the adversary performance, tries to\nminimize the adversary log-likelihood. On the other hand, the releaser in the\nDI approach completely relies on the feedback received from the adversary and\nis optimized to maximize its uncertainty. The performance of these two\nalgorithms is evaluated empirically using real-world SMs data, considering an\nattacker with access to SI (e.g., the day of the week) that tries to infer the\noccupancy status from the released SMs data. The results show that, although\nthey perform similarly when the attacker does not exploit the SI, in general,\nthe CAL method is less sensitive to the inclusion of SI. However, in both\ncases, privacy levels are significantly affected, particularly when multiple\nsources of SI are included.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2020 14:05:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Nov 2021 23:21:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-17"}

Internal\nchanges or an external dust cloud have been suggested as reasons for this\nchange in variability. We examine whether the dimming and brightening event of\n2019-20 could be due to a critical transition in the pulsation dynamics of\nBetelgeuse, by studying the characteristics of the light curve prior to\ntransition. We calculate the quantifiers hypothesised to rise prior to a\ncritical transition for the light curve of Betelgeuse upto the dimming event of\n2019-20. These include the autocorrelation at lag-1, variance and the spectral\ncoefficient calculated from detrended fluctation analysis (DFA), apart from two\nmeasures that quantify the recurrence properties of the light curve.\nSignificant rises are confirmed using the Mann-Kendall trend test. We see a\nsignificant increase in all quantifiers (p < 0.05) prior to the dimming event\nof 2019-20. This suggests that the event was a critical transition related to\nthe underlying nonlinear dynamics of the star. Together with results that\nsuggests minimal change in $T_{eff}$ and infra-red flux, a critical transition\nin the pulsation dynamics could be a possible reason for the unprecedented\ndimming of Betelgeuse.

To cope with this growth, intelligent management of the consumption\nprofile of the households is necessary, such that the households can save the\nelectricity bills, and the stress to the power grid during peak hours can be\nreduced. However, implementing such a method is challenging due to the\nexistence of randomness in the electricity price and the consumption of the\nappliances. To address this challenge, we employ a model-free method for the\nhouseholds which works with limited information about the uncertain factors.\nMore specifically, the interactions between households and the power grid can\nbe modeled as a non-cooperative stochastic game, where the electricity price is\nviewed as a stochastic variable. To search for the Nash equilibrium (NE) of the\ngame, we adopt a method based on distributed deep reinforcement learning. Also,\nthe proposed method can preserve the privacy of the households. We then utilize\nreal-world data from Pecan Street Inc., which contains the power consumption\nprofile of more than 1; 000 households, to evaluate the performance of the\nproposed method.

We also explore\nthis effect using opposition control. For riblets, Luchini et al. (1991)\nproposed that their effect could be reduced to the offset between the\nstreamwise- and spanwise-velocity origins, the latter being the origin\nperceived by turbulence. Later results on superhydrophobic surfaces suggest\nthat the apparent wall-normal-velocity origin could also play a role. Our\nresults support that the relevant parameter is the offset between the origins\nperceived by the mean flow and by turbulence. The former is determined by the\nstreamwise slip length, but the latter depends on both the wall-normal and\nspanwise slip lengths. The slip on the streamwise velocity fluctuations, in\nturn, has a negligible effect on the virtual origin for turbulence, at least in\nthe drag-reduction regime. This suggests that the origin perceived by the\nquasi-streamwise vortices, which induce the cross velocities at the surface, is\nkey in determining the virtual origin for turbulence, while that perceived by\nthe near-wall streaks, which are associated with the streamwise velocity\nfluctuations, plays a secondary role.

However,\ntaking into account both the interactions among electrons/holes, and the host\nband structures, is challenging. Here we combine first-principles\nband-structure calculations with quantum-chemistry methodology to evaluate the\nground and excited states of a pair of phosphorous donors in silicon within s\nsingle framework. We use a broken-symmetry Hartree-Fock approach, followed by a\ntime-dependent Hartree-Fock method to compute the excited states. Our\nHamiltonian for each valley includes an anisotropic kinetic energy term, which\nsplits the 2p_0 and 2p_+- transitions of isolated donors by ~4 meV, in good\nagreement with experiments. Our single-valley calculations show the optical\nresponse is a strong function of the optical polarisation, and suggest the use\nof valley polarisation to control optics and reduce oscillations in exchange\ninteractions. When taking into account all valleys, including valley-orbital\ninteractions, we find a gap opens between the 1s to 2p transition and\nlow-energy charge-transfer states within 1s manifolds (which become optically\nallowed because of inter-donor interactions). In contrast to the single-valley\ncase, we find charge-transfer excited states also in the triplet sector, thanks\nto the valley degrees of freedom. These states have a qualitatively correct\nenergy as compared with the previous experiments; additionally, we predict new\nexcitations below 20 meV that have not been analysed previously.

In\nthis paper, we develop a method for human activity recognition that tackles\nthese two issues. In the proposed method, an activity is divided into several\nsuccessive actions represented by spatio temporal patterns, and the evolution\nof these actions are captured by a sequential model. A refined comprehensive\nspatio temporal graph is utilized to represent a single action, which is a\nqualitative representation of a human action incorporating both the spatial and\ntemporal relations of the participant objects.

The Frobenius norm is used for the heavy Gaussian noise in some\nreal world scenarios. The alternating direction method of multipliers is\nadopted to solve the proposed optimization model, which simultaneously exploits\nthe global low rank property and the spatial spectral smoothness of the HSI.\nNumerical experiments on both simulated and real data illustrate the\nsuperiority of the proposed method in comparison with the existing ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2020 02:10:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-03"}

Many researchers have been\nstudying this issue, and the most pioneering one is Harry Markowitz's Modern\nPortfolio Theory developed in 1952, which is the cornerstone of investment\nportfolio management and aims at \"maximum the return at the given risk\". In\ncontrast to that, fifty years later, E. Robert Fernholz's Stochastic Portfolio\nTheory, as opposed to the normative assumption served as the basis of earlier\nmodern portfolio theory, is consistent with the observable characteristics of\nactual portfolios and markets. In this paper, after introducing some basic\ntheories of Markowitz's MPT and Fernholz's SPT, then we step across to the\napplication side, trying to figure out under four basic models based on\nMarkowitz Efficient Frontier, including Markowitz Model, Constant Correlation\nModel, Single Index Model, and Multi-Factor Model, which portfolios will be\nselected and how do these portfolios perform in the real world.
