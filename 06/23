While current\nstate-of-the-art methods employ importance reweighting to design various risk\nestimators, they ignored the learning capability of the model itself, which\ncould have provided reliable supervision. This motivates us to propose a novel\nSelf-PU learning framework, which seamlessly integrates PU learning and\nself-training. Self-PU highlights three \"self\"-oriented building blocks: a\nself-paced training algorithm that adaptively discovers and augments confident\npositive/negative examples as the training proceeds; a self-calibrated\ninstance-aware loss; and a self-distillation scheme that introduces\nteacher-students learning as an effective regularization for PU learning. We\ndemonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of Self-PU on common PU learning\nbenchmarks (MNIST and CIFAR-10), which compare favorably against the latest\ncompetitors. Moreover, we study a real-world application of PU learning, i.e.,\nclassifying brain images of Alzheimer's Disease.

In many applications $f$ may be\nnonconvex-nonconcave, and finding a global min-max point may be computationally\nintractable. There is a long line of work that seeks computationally tractable\nalgorithms for alternatives to the min-max optimization model. However, many of\nthe alternative models have solution points which are only guaranteed to exist\nunder strong assumptions on $f$, such as convexity, monotonicity, or special\nproperties of the starting point. We propose an optimization model, the\n$\\varepsilon$-greedy adversarial equilibrium, and show that it can serve as a\ncomputationally tractable alternative to the min-max optimization model.\nRoughly, we say that a point $(x^\\star, y^\\star)$ is an $\\varepsilon$-greedy\nadversarial equilibrium if $y^\\star$ is an $\\varepsilon$-approximate local\nmaximum for $f(x^\\star,\\cdot)$, and $x^\\star$ is an $\\varepsilon$-approximate\nlocal minimum for a \"greedy approximation\" to the function $\\max_z f(x, z)$\nwhich can be efficiently estimated using second-order optimization algorithms.\nWe prove the existence of such a point for any smooth function which is bounded\nand has Lipschitz Hessian.

However, CNNs do not\nexplicitly encode objects, parts, and their physical properties, which has\nlimited CNNs' success on tasks that require structured understanding of visual\nscenes. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the idea of Physical Scene\nGraphs (PSGs), which represent scenes as hierarchical graphs, with nodes in the\nhierarchy corresponding intuitively to object parts at different scales, and\nedges to physical connections between parts. Bound to each node is a vector of\nlatent attributes that intuitively represent object properties such as surface\nshape and texture.

We show that PSGNet outperforms\nalternative self-supervised scene representation algorithms at scene\nsegmentation tasks, especially on complex real-world images, and generalizes\nwell to unseen object types and scene arrangements.

In this\npaper, we provide a brief analysis of existing Machine Learning (ML)\napplications for forest ecosystem restoration projects. We go on to question if\ntheir inherent limitations may prevent them from being able to adequately\naddress socio-cultural aspects of the well-being of all involved stakeholders.\nBias and unintended consequences pose significant risks of downstream negative\nimplications of ML-based solutions. We suggest that adaptive and scalable\npractices could incentivize interdisciplinary collaboration during all stages\nof ecosystemic ML restoration projects and align incentives between human and\nalgorithmic actors. Furthermore, framing ML projects as open and reiterative\nprocesses can facilitate access on various levels and create incentives that\nlead to catalytic cooperation in the scaling of restoration efforts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2020 16:17:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2020 17:00:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2020 15:05:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-16"}

An important input for NMF is the latent dimensionality of\nthe data, that is, the number of hidden features, K, present in the explored\ndata set. Unfortunately, this quantity is rarely known a priori.

Then, short trajectories are sequentially selected so\nthat the accumulated PDF reproduces $\\phi_R(r_{p{\\rightarrow}O})$ to\nincreasingly high accuracy. Using these pre-sampled trajectories, we\ndemonstrate that the averaged $S_e(v_p)$ converges in the whole velocity range\nwith less than eight trajectories, while other averaging methods using randomly\nand uniformly distributed trajectories require approximately ten times the\ncomputational effort. This allows us to compare the $S_e(v_p)$ curve to\nexperimental data, and assess widely used empirical tables based on Bragg's\nrule.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2020 16:39:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Jun 2020 11:12:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

The\nalternate conversion does not require an OFDM demodulator and is shown to have\nlower complexity than the two-step conversion.

We show in which cases two\ninteracting spins can show elementary hysteresis and we give a connection to\nthe Preisach model, which allows us to consider an infinite number of\nspin-pairs. This thermodynamic limit leads us to a dynamical system with an\nadditional hysteretic force in the form of a generalized play operator. By\nusing methods from general chaos theory, piecewise-smooth system theory and\nstatistics we investigate the chaotic behavior of the dynamical system for a\nfew spins and also in case of a larger number of spins by calculating\nbifurcation diagrams, Lyapunov exponents, fractal dimensions and self-averaging\nproperties.

Late\ngadolinium enhancement (LGE) cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) provides an\nimportant protocol to visualize MI.

Furthermore, compared with the other sequences LGE CMR\nimages with gold standard labels are particularly limited, which represents\nanother obstacle for developing novel algorithms for automatic segmentation of\nLGE CMR. This paper presents the selective results from the Multi-Sequence\nCardiac MR (MS-CMR) Segmentation challenge, in conjunction with MICCAI 2019.\nThe challenge offered a data set of paired MS-CMR images, including auxiliary\nCMR sequences as well as LGE CMR, from 45 patients who underwent\ncardiomyopathy. It was aimed to develop new algorithms, as well as benchmark\nexisting ones for LGE CMR segmentation and compare them objectively. In\naddition, the paired MS-CMR images could enable algorithms to combine the\ncomplementary information from the other sequences for the segmentation of LGE\nCMR. Nine representative works were selected for evaluation and comparisons,\namong which three methods are unsupervised methods and the other six are\nsupervised. The results showed that the average performance of the nine methods\nwas comparable to the inter-observer variations. The success of these methods\nwas mainly attributed to the inclusion of the auxiliary sequences from the\nMS-CMR images, which provide important label information for the training of\ndeep neural networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2020 17:04:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 17 Jul 2021 13:55:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-20"}

At the interfaces\nof the junction, omni-directional total reflection takes place, named\nanti-super-Klein tunneling, as this effect is not due to an energetically\nforbidden region but due to pseudo-spin blocking. The anti-super-Klein\ntunneling confines electrons within the junction, which thus represents a\nperfect lossless electron waveguide. Calculating the current flow by applying\nthe Green's function method onto a tight-binding model of phosphorene, it is\nobserved that narrow electron beams propagate in these waveguides like light\nbeams in optical fibers. The perfect guiding is found for all steering angles\nof the electron beam as the total reflection does not rely on the existence of\na critical angle. For low electron energies and narrow junctions, the guided\nmodes of the waveguide are observed. The waveguide operates without any loss\nonly for a specific orientation of the junction.

To\naccomplish this task, the implant can be either reconstructed directly from the\ndefective skull or obtained by taking the difference between a defective skull\nand a complete skull. In the latter case, a complete skull has to be\nreconstructed given a defective skull, which defines a volumetric shape\ncompletion problem. Our baseline approach for this task is based on the former\nformulation, i.e., a deep neural network is trained to predict the implants\ndirectly from the defective skulls.

When used for the purpose of communication,\nthis setup embodies a multiple access channel (MAC) built with a single\nparticle.\n  We provide a full characterization of the N-party classical MACs that can be\nbuilt from a single particle, and we show that every non-classical particle can\ngenerate a MAC outside the classical set. To further distinguish the\ncapabilities of a single classical and quantum particle, we relax the locality\nconstraint and allow for joint encodings by subsets of 1<K<= N parties. This\ngenerates a richer family of classical MACs whose polytope dimension we\ncompute. We identify a \"generalized fingerprinting inequality\" as a valid facet\nfor this polytope, and we verify that a quantum particle distributed among N\nseparated parties can violate this inequality even when K=N-1. Connections are\ndrawn between the single-particle framework and multi-level coherence theory.\nWe show that every pure state with K-level coherence can be detected in a\nsemi-device independent manner, with the only assumption being conservation of\nparticle number.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2020 17:53:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 9 May 2021 17:19:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 8 Feb 2022 06:38:36 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 9 Feb 2022 04:24:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-09"}

In this paper, instead of studying algorithmic improvements that can\naddress such non-episodic and sparse reward settings, we instead study the\nkinds of environment properties that can make learning under such conditions\neasier. Understanding how properties of the environment impact the performance\nof reinforcement learning agents can help us to structure our tasks in ways\nthat make learning tractable. We first discuss what we term \"environment\nshaping\" -- modifications to the environment that provide an alternative to\nreward shaping, and may be easier to implement. We then discuss an even simpler\nproperty that we refer to as \"dynamism,\" which describes the degree to which\nthe environment changes independent of the agent's actions and can be measured\nby environment transition entropy. Surprisingly, we find that even this\nproperty can substantially alleviate the challenges associated with\nnon-episodic RL in sparse reward settings. We provide an empirical evaluation\non a set of new tasks focused on non-episodic learning with sparse rewards.\nThrough this study, we hope to shift the focus of the community towards\nanalyzing how properties of the environment can affect learning and the\nultimate type of behavior that is learned via RL.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2020 17:55:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-23"}

There exists a unique topological bulk-surface-edge\ncorrespondence for the spinless six-fold excitation, resulting in trivial\nsurface 'Fermi arcs' but nontrivial hinge arcs.

This structure is also a promising\ncandidate to host some of the oldest stars in the Galaxy.

The\nmost common method of constraining their properties is searching the spectra of\nthe most metal-poor stars for the chemical elements created in the first stars\nand their supernova. In this approach, modelled supernova yields are compared\nto the observed abundance patterns in extremely metal-poor stars. The method\ntypically only uses the abundance ratios, i.e., the yields are diluted to the\nobserved level. Following the usual assumption of spherical symmetry we compute\na simple lower limit of the mass a supernova can mix with and find that it is\nconsistent with all published simulations of early chemical enrichment in the\ninterstellar medium. For three different cases, we demonstrate that this\ndilution limit can change the conclusions from the abundance fitting. There is\na large discrepancy between the dilution found in simulations of SN explosions\nin minihaloes and the dilution assumed in many abundance fits. Limiting the\ndilution can significantly alter the likelihood of which supernovae are\npossible progenitors of observed CEMP-no stars. In particular, some of the\nfaint, very low-yield SNe, which have been suggested as models for the\nabundance pattern of SMSS0313-6708, cannot explain the measured metal\nabundances, as their predicted metal yields are too small by two orders of\nmagnitude. Altogether, the new dilution model presented here emphasizes the\nneed to better understand the mixing and dilution behaviour of aspherical SNe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2020 18:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-09"}

However, HPC cluster administrators/providers\nstill face challenges in terms of resource elasticity and virtual machine (VM)\nprovisioning at large-scale, due to the lack of coordination between a\ntraditional HPC scheduler and the VM hypervisor (resource management layer).\nThis lack of interaction leads to low cluster utilization and job completion\nthroughput. Furthermore, the VM provisioning delays directly impact the overall\nperformance of jobs in the cluster. Hence, there is a need for effectively\nprovisioning virtualized HPC clusters, which can best-utilize the physical\nhardware with minimal provisioning overheads.\n  Towards this, we propose Multiverse, a VM provisioning framework, which can\ndynamically spawn VMs for incoming jobs in a virtualized HPC cluster, by\nintegrating the HPC scheduler along with VM resource manager. We have\nimplemented this framework on the Slurm} scheduler along with the vSphere VM\nresource manager. In order to reduce the VM provisioning overheads, we use\ninstant cloning which shares both the disk and memory with the parent VM, when\ncompared to full VM cloning which has to boot-up a new VM from scratch.\nMeasurements with real-world HPC workloads demonstrate that, instant cloning is\n2.5x faster than full cloning in terms of VM provisioning time. Further, it\nimproves resource utilization by up to 40%, and cluster throughput by up to\n1.5x, when compared to full clone for bursty job arrival scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2020 18:46:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-24"}

This problem is NP-hard and APX-hard, with\nthe currently best known approximation factor $1/2$ (Chen et al., Algorithmica\n2019). For the case of claw-free graphs, Chen et al. present an involved\napproximation algorithm with approximation factor $7/12$. They asked whether it\nis possible to improve these ratios, in particular for claw-free graphs and\ncubic graphs.\n  We improve the approximation factors for the MaxwIST problem in cubic graphs\nand claw-free graphs. For cubic graphs we present an algorithm that computes a\nspanning tree whose total weight of internal vertices is at least\n$\\frac{3}{4}-\\frac{3}{n}$ times the total weight of all vertices, where $n$ is\nthe number of vertices of $G$. This ratio is almost tight for large values of\n$n$.

In addition to improving the approximation factors, the new\nalgorithms are relatively short compared to that of Chen et al.. The new\nalgorithms are fairly simple, and employ a variant of the depth-first search\nalgorithm that selects a relatively-large-weight vertex in every branching\nstep. Moreover, the new algorithms take linear time while previous algorithms\nfor similar problem instances are super-linear.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2020 18:47:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-24"}

Explaining this immense growth and\nincorporating it in galaxy evolution theories is one of the long-standing\nchallenges in astrophysics. So far, the most successful theory for the\nsustained growth of the galactic magnetic field is the alpha-omega dynamo. This\ntheory predicts a characteristic dipolar or quadrupolar morphology for the\ngalactic magnetic field, which has been observed in external galaxies. However,\nso far, there has been no direct demonstration of a mean-field dynamo operating\nin direct, multi-physics simulations of spiral galaxies.

Naturally, the resulting magnetic field has a complex morphology that\nincludes a strong random component. Using a smoothing of the magnetic field on\nsmall scales, we are able to separate the mean from the turbulent component and\nanalyze them individually. We find that a mean-field dynamo naturally occurs as\na result of the dynamical evolution of the galaxy and amplifies the magnetic\nfield by an order of magnitude over half a Gyr. Despite the highly dynamical\nnature of these models, the morphology of the mean component of the field is\nidentical to analytical predictions. This result underlines the importance of\nthe mean-field dynamo in galactic evolution.

Similar to Dwork et al., we adopt the individual fairness notion which\nmandates that similar individuals should be treated similarly for clustering\nproblems.

The three dimensional microstructure of the material, a\nfuel cell gas diffusion layer, is acquired via X-ray computed tomography and\nused as input for lattice Boltzmann simulations. We perform a quantitative\nanalysis of the multiphase pore-scale dynamics and we identify the dominant\nfluid structures governing mass transport. The results show the existence of\nthree different regimes of transport: a fast inertial dynamics at short times,\ncharacterised by a compact uniform front, a viscous-capillary regime at\nintermediate times, where liquid is transported along a gradually increasing\nnumber of preferential flow paths of the size of one-two pores, and a third\nregime at longer times, where liquid, after having reached the outlet, is\nexclusively flowing along such flow paths and the two-phase fluid structures\nare stabilised. We observe that the fibrous layer presents significant\nvariations in its microscopic morphology, which have an important effect on the\npore invasion dynamics, and counteract the stabilising viscous force. Liquid\ntransport is indeed affected by the presence of microstructure-induced\ncapillary pressures acting adversely to the flow, leading to capillary\nfingering transport mechanism and unstable front displacement, even in the\nabsence of hydrophobic treatments of the porous material. We propose a\nmacroscopic model based on an effective contact angle that mimics the effects\nof the such a dynamic capillary pressure. Finally, we underline the\nsignificance of the results for the optimal design of face masks in an effort\nto mitigate the current COVID-19 pandemic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2020 20:46:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Oct 2020 14:42:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 10 Nov 2020 20:54:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-12"}

The source was\nlocalized to 18.5 deg$^2$ at a distance of $241^{+41}_{-45}$ Mpc; no\nelectromagnetic counterpart has been confirmed to date. The source has the most\nunequal mass ratio yet measured with gravitational waves,\n$0.112^{+0.008}_{-0.009}$, and its secondary component is either the lightest\nblack hole or the heaviest neutron star ever discovered in a double\ncompact-object system. The dimensionless spin of the primary black hole is\ntightly constrained to $\\leq 0.07$. Tests of general relativity reveal no\nmeasurable deviations from the theory, and its prediction of higher-multipole\nemission is confirmed at high confidence. We estimate a merger rate density of\n1-23 Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ for the new class of binary coalescence sources that\nGW190814 represents. Astrophysical models predict that binaries with mass\nratios similar to this event can form through several channels, but are\nunlikely to have formed in globular clusters.

Inspired by the statistical mechanics approach to\nlearning, we formally define and develop a methodology to compute precisely the\nfull distribution of test errors among interpolating classifiers from several\nmodel classes. We apply our method to compute this distribution for several\nreal and synthetic datasets, with both linear and random feature classification\nmodels. We find that test errors tend to concentrate around a small typical\nvalue $\\varepsilon^*$, which deviates substantially from the test error of the\nworst-case interpolating model on the same datasets, indicating that \"bad\"\nclassifiers are extremely rare. We provide theoretical results in a simple\nsetting in which we characterize the full asymptotic distribution of test\nerrors, and we show that these indeed concentrate around a value\n$\\varepsilon^*$, which we also identify exactly.

This formalism can accommodate patterns, waves and oscillations in\nreaction-diffusion systems and neural field equations. To do this, we define\nthe phase by precisely projecting the infinite-dimensional system onto the\nmanifold of isometries. Two differing types of stochastic phase dynamics are\ndefined: (i) a variational phase, obtained by insisting that the difference\nbetween the projection and the original solution is orthogonal to the\nnon-decaying eigenmodes, and (ii) an isochronal phase, defined as the limiting\npoint on manifold obtained by taking $t\\to\\infty$ in the absence of noise. We\noutline precise stochastic differential equations for both types of phase. The\nvariational phase SDE is then used to show that the probability of the system\nleaving the attracting basin of the manifold after an exponentially long period\nof time (in $\\epsilon^{-2}$, the magnitude of the noise) is exponentially\nunlikely. In the case that the manifold is periodic (such as for spiral waves,\nspatially-distributed oscillations, or neural-field phenomena on a compact\ndomain), the isochronal phase SDE is used to determine asymptotic limits for\nthe average occupation times of the phase as it wanders in the basin of\nattraction of the manifold over very long times.

It is the ability\nto stop working on a task, switch to another, and return eventually to the\nfirst one, as needed or as scheduled. Multitasking, however, comes at a\ncognitive cost: frequent context-switches can lead to distraction, sub-standard\nwork, and even greater stress. Aims: This paper reports a replication\nexperiment where we gathered data on a group of developers from a software\ndevelopment company from industry on a large collection of projects stored in\nGitLab repositories. Method: We reused the developed models and methods from\nthe original study for measuring the rate and breadth of a developers'\ncontext-switching behavior, and we study how context-switching affects their\nproductivity. We applied semi-structured interviews, replacing the original\nsurvey, to some of the developers to understand the reasons for and perceptions\nof multitasking. Results: We found out that industry developers multitask as\nmuch as OSS developers focusing more (on fewer projects), and working more\nrepetitively from one day to the next is associated with higher productivity,\nbut there is no effect for higher multitasking. Some commons reasons make them\nmultitask: dependencies, personal interests, and social relationships.\nConclusions: Short context change, less than three minutes, did not impact\nresults from industry developers; however, more than that, it brings a feeling\nof left the previous tasks behind. So, it is proportional to how much context\nis switched: as bigger the context and bigger the interruption, it is worst to\ncome back.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2020 21:41:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-24"}

Using a secondary source\npresent in a wireless communication environment, such as a backscatter tag, it\nis possible to leverage the incoming radiation from the source as a\nreference-wave to synthesize the desired wavefront across the reflecting\nsurface, radiating a field of interest. In this geometry, the phase grating,\nwhich is synthesized using an array of sub-wavelength unit cells, is calculated\nby interacting the incident reference-wave and the desired wavefront, similar\nto a hologram. When illuminated by the reference-wave, the reflected wavefront\nfrom the calculated phase grating is guaranteed to constructively add in the\ndirection of the desired radiation (beam-steering in the far-field) and also\nfocus at the intended depth (beam-focusing in the radiative near-field).\nLeveraging a dynamic modulation mechanism in the context of an intelligent\nreflective surface (IRS) illuminated by a backscatter tag, later, we present\nthat one can selectively focus and defocus at an arbitrarily positioned\nreceiver within the 3D field of view of the reflecting surface. This enables\nthe control of the amplitude of the radiated electric field at the receiver\nlocation, paving the way for a spatial modulation mechanism by means of\nreconfiguring the reflecting surface in a backscattered wireless communication\nenvironment. In addition to the phase modification approach on a unit cell\nlevel to reconfigure the aperture radiated wavefronts, we finally present a\ntime varying IRS concept making use of a time-delay based approach relying on a\ndelay adjustment between the reflection coefficients of the IRS' unit cell\nlattices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2020 22:05:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-24"}

This paper studies three inverter future deployment\nscenarios with droop control inverters, non-exporting inverters, and\ncoordinated inverter control (CIC). The network operation and the interaction\nbetween various inverter control methods are studied by simulating inverter\noperation on two low-voltage networks. Considering 30% PV penetration as the\nbase case, we demonstrate that coordinated inverters can mitigate overvoltages\nand voltage fluctuations caused by the tripping of passive inverters in 85% of\nPV location cases when at least as many coordinated as passive inverters are\ndeployed on the 114-node test feeder. However, this rate reduced to 37% with\nthe IEEE 906-node network demonstrating that the deployment of coordinated\ninverter control may not be able to reverse passive inverter-related voltage\ndisturbances when the build-up of passive inverters has reached a certain\nthreshold.\n  The aggregated PV output from coordinated inverters can be also used to\nprovide grid support services. When the low-voltage networks operate close to\nthe upper voltage limits, the change in the power output from coordinated\ninverters following a regulation request may be partially offset by passive\ninverters. Considering an equal number of passive and coordinated inverters,\nthis paper shows that for each unit of the down-regulation request delivered by\ncoordinated inverters, passive inverter output may increase by up to 0.2 units\nand decrease by up to 0.45 units during coordinated inverter up-regulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2020 22:06:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-24"}

Further, we present a quantum polar\ncode exploiting the multilevel nature of polarization, and provide an efficient\ndecoding for this code. We show that half-noisy channels can be frozen by\nfixing their inputs in either the amplitude or the phase basis, which allows\nreducing the number of preshared EPR pairs compared to the construction in [1].\nWe provide an upper bound on the number of preshared EPR pairs, which is an\nequality in the case of the quantum erasure channel. To improve the speed of\npolarization, we propose an alternative construction, which again polarizes in\nmulti-levels, and the previous upper bound on the number of preshared EPR pairs\nalso holds.

Most current\nattacks and defenses try to avoid this issue by considering restrictive\nadversarial threat models such as those bounded by $L_2$ or $L_\\infty$\ndistance, spatial perturbations, etc. However, models that are robust against\nany of these restrictive threat models are still fragile against other threat\nmodels. To resolve this issue, we propose adversarial training against the set\nof all imperceptible adversarial examples, approximated using deep neural\nnetworks. We call this threat model the neural perceptual threat model (NPTM);\nit includes adversarial examples with a bounded neural perceptual distance (a\nneural network-based approximation of the true perceptual distance) to natural\nimages. Through an extensive perceptual study, we show that the neural\nperceptual distance correlates well with human judgements of perceptibility of\nadversarial examples, validating our threat model.\n  Under the NPTM, we develop novel perceptual adversarial attacks and defenses.\nBecause the NPTM is very broad, we find that Perceptual Adversarial Training\n(PAT) against a perceptual attack gives robustness against many other types of\nadversarial attacks. We test PAT on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-100 against five\ndiverse adversarial attacks. We find that PAT achieves state-of-the-art\nrobustness against the union of these five attacks, more than doubling the\naccuracy over the next best model, without training against any of them. That\nis, PAT generalizes well to unforeseen perturbation types. This is vital in\nsensitive applications where a particular threat model cannot be assumed, and\nto the best of our knowledge, PAT is the first adversarial training defense\nwith this property.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2020 22:40:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Oct 2020 22:07:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2021 17:28:08 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 4 Jul 2021 19:34:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-06"}

To overcome these issues, an accelerated\nDRL algorithm named PARS was developed and tailored for power system voltage\nstability control via load shedding. PARS features high scalability and is easy\nto tune with only five main hyperparameters. The method was tested on both the\nIEEE 39-bus and IEEE 300-bus systems, and the latter is by far the largest\nscale for such a study. Test results show that, compared to other methods\nincluding model-predictive control (MPC) and proximal policy optimization(PPO)\nmethods, PARS shows better computational efficiency (faster convergence), more\nrobustness in learning, excellent scalability and generalization capability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2020 23:48:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 5 Dec 2020 06:40:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-08"}

Two central features of these dynamic\nsystems are parameters and unmodeled dynamics. This paper addresses the use of\na spectral lines-based approach for estimating parameters of the dynamic model\nof an autonomous system. Existing literature has treated all unmodeled\ncomponents of the dynamic system as sub-Gaussian noise and proposed parameter\nestimation using Gaussian noise-based exogenous signals. In contrast, we allow\nthe unmodeled part to have deterministic unmodeled dynamics, which are almost\nalways present in physical systems, in addition to sub-Gaussian noise. In\naddition, we propose a deterministic construction of the exogenous signal in\norder to carry out parameter estimation. We introduce a new tool kit which\nemploys the theory of spectral lines, retains the stochastic setting, and leads\nto non-asymptotic bounds on the parameter estimation error. Unlike the existing\nstochastic approach, these bounds are tunable through an optimal choice of the\nspectrum of the exogenous signal leading to accurate parameter estimation. We\nalso show that this estimation is robust to unmodeled dynamics, a property that\nis not assured by the existing approach.

However, finding a good set of hyperparameters\nfor a CNN remains a challenging task. It usually takes an expert with deep\nknowledge, and trials and errors. Genetic algorithms have been used in\nhyperparameter optimizations. However, traditional genetic algorithms with\nfixed-length chromosomes may not be a good fit for optimizing deep learning\nhyperparameters, because deep learning models have variable number of\nhyperparameters depending on the model depth. As the depth increases, the\nnumber of hyperparameters grows exponentially, and searching becomes\nexponentially harder. It is important to have an efficient algorithm that can\nfind a good model in reasonable time. In this article, we propose to use a\nvariable length genetic algorithm (GA) to systematically and automatically tune\nthe hyperparameters of a CNN to improve its performance.

There are many computer vision tasks that\nwork best with a linear image state, such as image deblurring and image\ndehazing. Unfortunately, the vast majority of images are saved in the nonlinear\nimage state. Because of this, a number of methods have been proposed to\n\"unprocess\" nonlinear images back to a raw-RGB state. However, existing\nunprocessing methods have a drawback because raw-RGB images are\nsensor-specific. As a result, it is necessary to know which camera produced the\nsRGB output and use a method or network tailored for that sensor to properly\nunprocess it. This paper addresses this limitation by exploiting another camera\nimage state that is not available as an output, but it is available inside the\ncamera pipeline. In particular, cameras apply a colorimetric conversion step to\nconvert the raw-RGB image to a device-independent space based on the CIE XYZ\ncolor space before they apply the nonlinear photo-finishing. Leveraging this\ncanonical image state, we propose a deep learning framework, CIE XYZ Net, that\ncan unprocess a nonlinear image back to the canonical CIE XYZ image. This image\ncan then be processed by any low-level computer vision operator and re-rendered\nback to the nonlinear image.

We still know little about how\nlocomotor transitions emerge from physical interaction with complex terrain.\nConsequently, robots largely rely on geometric maps to avoid obstacles, not\ntraverse them. Recent studies revealed that locomotor transitions in complex\n3-D terrain occur probabilistically via multiple pathways. Here, we show that\nan energy landscape approach elucidates the underlying physical principles. We\ndiscovered that locomotor transitions of animals and robots self-propelled\nthrough complex 3-D terrain correspond to barrier-crossing transitions on a\npotential energy landscape. Locomotor modes are attracted to landscape basins\nseparated by potential energy barriers. Kinetic energy fluctuation from\noscillatory self-propulsion helps the system stochastically escape from one\nbasin and reach another to make transitions. Escape is more likely towards\nlower barrier direction. These principles are surprisingly similar to those of\nnear-equilibrium, microscopic systems. Analogous to free energy landscapes for\nmulti-pathway protein folding transitions, our energy landscape approach from\nfirst principles is the beginning of a statistical physics theory of\nmulti-pathway locomotor transitions in complex terrain. This will not only help\nunderstand how the organization of animal behavior emerges from multi-scale\ninteractions between their neural and mechanical systems and the physical\nenvironment, but also guide robot design, control, and planning over the large,\nintractable locomotor-terrain parameter space to generate robust locomotor\ntransitions through the real world.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2020 03:29:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-04"}

We show\nthat there is a unidirectional Granger causality, from the median percentage of\ntime spent daily at home to the daily number of COVID-19-related deaths with a\nlag of 2 weeks. We further analyze the mobility patterns at the census block\nlevel to identify which parts of the population might encounter difficulties in\nadhering and complying with social distancing measures. This information is\nimportant, since it can consequently drive interventions that aim at helping\nthese parts of the population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2020 03:36:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 19 Jul 2020 22:55:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-21"}

The subsequent\napplication of mechanical forces leads to the deformation mode branching where\nthe metamaterial architecture transforms into two distinctly different shapes,\nwhich exhibit very different deformations and enable great tunability in\nproperties such as mechanical stiffness and acoustic bandgaps. Furthermore,\nthis metamaterial design can be incorporated with magnetic shape memory\npolymers with global stiffness tunability, which further enables the global\nshift of the acoustic behaviors. The combination of magnetic and mechanical\nactuations, as well as shape memory effects, imbue unmatched tunable properties\nto a new paradigm of metamaterials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2020 03:37:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-25"}

For a general\nclass of near-disk domains, we illustrate through several specific examples how\nsimple, but yet highly accurate, numerical methods can be used to implement the\nasymptotic theory. From the derivation of a new explicit formula for the\nNeumann Green's function and its regular part for the ellipse, a numerical\napproach based on our asymptotic theory is used to investigate how the spatial\ndistribution of the optimal trap locations changes as the aspect ratio of an\nellipse of fixed area is varied.

Recent experiments create cat states in a\nmicrowave cavity field using superconducting circuits. As with degenerate\nparametric oscillation (DPO) in an adiabatic and highly nonlinear limit, the\nstates are formed in a signal cavity mode via a two-photon dissipative process\ninduced by the down conversion of a pump field to generate pairs of signal\nphotons. The damping of the signal and the presence of thermal fluctuations\nrapidly decoheres the state, and the effect on the dynamics is to either\ndestroy the possibility of a cat state, or else to sharply reduce the lifetime\nand size of the cat-states that can be formed. In this paper, we study the\neffect on both the DPO and microwave systems of a squeezed reservoir coupled to\nthe cavity. While the threshold nonlinearity is not altered, we show that the\nuse of squeezed states significantly lengthens the lifetime of the cat states.\nThis improves the feasibility of generating cat states of large amplitude and\nwith a greater degree of quantum macroscopic coherence, which is necessary for\nmany quantum technology applications. Using current experimental parameters for\nthe microwave set-up, which requires a modified Hamiltonian, we further\ndemonstrate how squeezed states enhance the quality of the cat states that\ncould be formed in this regime. Squeezing also combats the significant\ndecoherence due to thermal noise, which is relevant for microwave fields at\nfinite temperature. By modeling a thermal squeezed reservoir, we show that the\nthermal decoherence of the dynamical cat states can be inhibited by a careful\ncontrol of the squeezing of the reservoir. To signify the quality of the cat\nstate, we consider different signatures including fringes and negativity, and\nthe $C_{l_{1}}$ measure of quantum coherence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2020 03:44:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-04"}

Joint occurrence of PME and spin glass type\nanomalies points to possible emergence of Pi junctions. BDD is a disordered\ns-wave superconductor; and Pi junctions could be produced by spin flip\nscattering of spin half moments when present at weak superconducting regions\n(Bulaevski et al. 1978). A frustrated network of 0 and Pi junctions will result\n(Kusmartsev et al. 1992) in a distribution of spontaneous equilibrium\nsupercurrents, a phase glass state. Anderson localized spin half spinons\nembedded in a metallic fluid (two fluid model of Bhatt et al.) could create Pi\njunction by spin flip scattering. Our findings are consistent with presence of\nPi junctions, invoked to explain their (Bhattacharyya et al.) observation of\ncertain resistance anomaly in BDD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2020 05:41:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-24"}

Existing asymmetric multi-task learning\nmethods tackle this negative transfer problem by performing knowledge transfer\nfrom tasks with low loss to tasks with high loss. However, using loss as a\nmeasure of reliability is risky since it could be a result of overfitting. In\nthe case of time-series prediction tasks, knowledge learned for one task (e.g.,\npredicting the sepsis onset) at a specific timestep may be useful for learning\nanother task (e.g., prediction of mortality) at a later timestep, but lack of\nloss at each timestep makes it difficult to measure the reliability at each\ntimestep. To capture such dynamically changing asymmetric relationships between\ntasks in time-series data, we propose a novel temporal asymmetric multi-task\nlearning model that performs knowledge transfer from certain tasks/timesteps to\nrelevant uncertain tasks, based on feature-level uncertainty. We validate our\nmodel on multiple clinical risk prediction tasks against various deep learning\nmodels for time-series prediction, which our model significantly outperforms,\nwithout any sign of negative transfer. Further qualitative analysis of learned\nknowledge graphs by clinicians shows that they are helpful in analyzing the\npredictions of the model.

This motivates us to scrutinize the\napplication of de-biased lasso in high-dimensional GLMs. When $p >n$, we detect\nthat a key sparsity condition on the inverse information matrix generally does\nnot hold in a GLM setting, which likely explains the subpar performance of\nde-biased lasso. Even in a less challenging \"large $n$, diverging $p$\"\nscenario, we find that de-biased lasso and the maximum likelihood method often\nyield confidence intervals with unsatisfactory coverage probabilities. In this\nscenario, we examine an alternative approach for further bias correction by\ndirectly inverting the Hessian matrix without imposing the matrix sparsity\nassumption.

With the\ntrend of privatization deployment of DNN models, the data leakage of the DNN\nmodels is becoming increasingly serious and widespread. All existing\nmodel-extraction attacks can only leak parts of targeted DNN models with low\naccuracy or high overhead. In this paper, we first identify a new attack\nsurface -- unencrypted PCIe traffic, to leak DNN models. Based on this new\nattack surface, we propose a novel model-extraction attack, namely Hermes\nAttack, which is the first attack to fully steal the whole victim DNN model.\nThe stolen DNN models have the same hyper-parameters, parameters, and\nsemantically identical architecture as the original ones. It is challenging due\nto the closed-source CUDA runtime, driver, and GPU internals, as well as the\nundocumented data structures and the loss of some critical semantics in the\nPCIe traffic. Additionally, there are millions of PCIe packets with numerous\nnoises and chaos orders. Our Hermes Attack addresses these issues by huge\nreverse engineering efforts and reliable semantic reconstruction, as well as\nskillful packet selection and order correction. We implement a prototype of the\nHermes Attack, and evaluate two sequential DNN models (i.e., MINIST and VGG)\nand one consequential DNN model (i.e., ResNet) on three NVIDIA GPU platforms,\ni.e., NVIDIA Geforce GT 730, NVIDIA Geforce GTX 1080 Ti, and NVIDIA Geforce RTX\n2080 Ti.

Moreover, interestingly, we found that the proposed RayS\nattack can also be used as a sanity check for possible \"falsely robust\" models.\nOn several recently proposed defenses that claim to achieve the\nstate-of-the-art robust accuracy, our attack method demonstrates that the\ncurrent white-box/black-box attacks could still give a false sense of security\nand the robust accuracy drop between the most popular PGD attack and RayS\nattack could be as large as $28\\%$. We believe that our proposed RayS attack\ncould help identify falsely robust models that beat most white-box/black-box\nattacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2020 07:01:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 5 Sep 2020 18:17:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-08"}

To tackle these problems, we propose\nPCW-Net, a Pyramid Combination and Warping cost volume-based network to achieve\ngood performance on both cross-domain generalization and stereo matching\naccuracy on various benchmarks. In particular, our PCW-Net is designed for two\npurposes. First, we construct combination volumes on the upper levels of the\npyramid and develop a cost volume fusion module to integrate them for initial\ndisparity estimation. Multi-scale receptive fields can be covered by fusing\nmulti-scale combination volumes, thus, domain-invariant features can be\nextracted. Second, we construct the warping volume at the last level of the\npyramid for disparity refinement. The proposed warping volume can narrow down\nthe residue searching range from the initial disparity searching range to a\nfine-grained one, which can dramatically alleviate the difficulty of the\nnetwork to find the correct residue in an unconstrained residue searching\nspace. When training on synthetic datasets and generalizing to unseen real\ndatasets, our method shows strong cross-domain generalization and outperforms\nexisting state-of-the-arts with a large margin.

The aim of the modelling framework is to provide\na tool able to link observations to physical models of exoplanet atmospheres.\nMethods: The modelling philosophy chosen in this paper is to use physical and\nchemical models to constrain certain parameters while keeping free the parts\nwhere our physical understanding is still more limited. This approach, in\nbetween full physical modelling and full parameterisation, allows us to use the\nprocesses we understand well and parameterise those less understood. A Bayesian\nretrieval framework is implemented and applied to the transit spectra of a set\nof 10 hot Jupiters.

As LIGO/Virgo frequency band spans from a few $\\rm Hz$ to a few $\n\\rm kHz$, the typical time resolution of current interferometers is of the\norder of milliseconds. When microlenses are embedded in galaxies or galaxy\nclusters, lensing can become more prominent and result in observable time\ndelays at LIGO/Virgo frequencies. Therefore, gravitational waves could offer an\nexciting alternative probe of microlensing.

For example, a CountMin sketch\napproximates the frequencies at which elements occur in a data stream, and a\nbatched counter counts events in batches. This paper focuses on the correctness\nof concurrent implementations of such objects. Specifically, we consider\nquantitative objects, whose return values are from a totally ordered domain,\nwith an emphasis on $(e,d)$-bounded objects that estimate a quantity with an\nerror of at most $e$ with probability at least $1 - d$.\n  The de facto correctness criterion for concurrent objects is linearizability.\nUnder linearizability, when a read overlaps an update, it must return the\nobject's value either before the update or after it. Consider, for example, a\nsingle batched increment operation that counts three new events, bumping a\nbatched counter's value from $7$ to $10$. In a linearizable implementation of\nthe counter, an overlapping read must return one of these. We observe, however,\nthat in typical use cases, any intermediate value would also be acceptable. To\ncapture this degree of freedom, we propose Intermediate Value Linearizability\n(IVL), a new correctness criterion that relaxes linearizability to allow\nreturning intermediate values, for instance $8$ in the example above. Roughly\nspeaking, IVL allows reads to return any value that is bounded between two\nreturn values that are legal under linearizability. A key feature of IVL is\nthat concurrent IVL implementations of $(e,d)$-bounded objects remain\n$(e,d)$-bounded. To illustrate the power of this result, we give a\nstraightforward and efficient concurrent implementation of an $(e, d)$-bounded\nCountMin sketch, which is IVL (albeit not linearizable). Finally, we show that\nIVL allows for inherently cheaper implementations than linearizable ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2020 10:45:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-24"}

We use the intrinsic property of the periodic orbits, namely their\nlinear horizontal and vertical stability, to validate or further constrain the\norbital elements of detected two-planet systems. We computed the families of\nperiodic orbits in the general three-body problem for several two-planet Kepler\nand K2 systems.

While a mean-motion resonance locking\nprotects the long-term evolution of the systems K2-21 and K2-24, such a\nresonant evolution is not possible for the Kepler-9 system, whose stability is\nmaintained through an apsidal anti-alignment. For the Kepler-108 system, we\nfind that the stability of its mutually inclined planets could be justified\neither solely by a mean-motion resonance, or in tandem with an inclination-type\nresonance. Going forward, dynamical analyses based on periodic orbits could\nyield better constrained orbital elements of near-resonant extrasolar systems\nwhen performed in parallel to the fitting of the observational data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2020 11:01:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-19"}

Glitches\nwith large amplitudes can produce triggers in the SNR time-series in spite of\ntheir small overlap with the templates.

From the vast literature that addressed this\ntopic for decades under various points of view (e.g., developmental psychology,\nexperimental design, artificial intelligence), intrinsic motivation emerged as\na concept that can practically be transferred to artificial agents. Especially,\nin the recent field of Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL), agents implement such\na concept (mainly using a novelty argument) in the shape of an exploration\nbonus, added to the task reward, that encourages visiting the whole\nenvironment. This approach is supported by the large amount of theory on RL for\nwhich convergence to optimality assumes exhaustive exploration. Yet, Human\nBeings and mammals do not exhaustively explore the world and their motivation\nis not only based on novelty but also on various other factors (e.g.,\ncuriosity, fun, style, pleasure, safety, competition, etc.). They optimize for\nlife-long learning and train to learn transferable skills in playgrounds\nwithout obvious goals. They also apply innate or learned priors to save time\nand stay safe. For these reasons, we propose to learn an exploration bonus from\ndemonstrations that could transfer these motivations to an artificial agent\nwith little assumptions about their rationale.

The numerical investigations demonstrate that: (1) the employed\nsolution approach based on the augmented Lagrangian method is able to handle\nlarge problems, with hundreds of millions of stress constraints; (2) if\nappropriate interpolation parameters are adopted, voxel-based (fixed grid)\nmodels can be used to compute von Mises stresses with excellent accuracy; and\n(3) in order to ensure manufacturing tolerance in three-dimensional\nstress-constrained topology optimization, a combination of double filtering and\nmore than three realizations may be required.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2020 12:05:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-23"}

To solve this\nproblem, we propose a novel compression and acceleration method based on data\ndistribution characteristics for deep neural networks, namely Pruning Filter\nvia Gaussian Distribution Feature (PFGDF). Compared with previous advanced\npruning methods, PFGDF compresses the model by filters with insignificance in\ndistribution, regardless of the contribution and sensitivity information of the\nconvolution filter. PFGDF is significantly different from weight sparsification\npruning because it does not require the special accelerated library to process\nthe sparse weight matrix and introduces no more extra parameters. The pruning\nprocess of PFGDF is automated. Furthermore, the model compressed by PFGDF can\nrestore the same performance as the uncompressed model. We evaluate PFGDF\nthrough extensive experiments, on CIFAR-10, PFGDF compresses the convolution\nfilter on VGG-16 by 66.62% with more than 90% parameter reduced, while the\ninference time is accelerated by 83.73% on Huawei MATE 10.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2020 13:03:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 14 May 2022 17:13:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 26 May 2022 15:48:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-27"}

A wide range of Weber numbers We\nand electro-capillary numbers Cae is covered to explore the various regimes of\ndroplet impact EHD. We show that for a fixed We 60, droplet rebound on SH\nsurface is suppressed with increase of electric field intensity. At high Cae,\ninstead of the usual uniform radial contraction, the droplets retract faster in\northogonal direction to the electric field and spread along the direction of\nthe electric field. This prevents the accumulation of sufficient kinetic energy\nto achieve the droplet rebound phenomena. For certain values of We and\nOhnesorge number Oh, droplets exhibit somersault like motion during rebound.\nSubsequently we propose a semi analytical model to explain the field induced\nrebound phenomenon on SH surfaces.

Even for a nonhelical magnetic field\nthere is a certain degree of inverse cascading for sufficiently strong magnetic\nfields. The inertial range scaling with wavenumber $k$ is compatible with\nearlier findings for the forced Hall cascade, i.e., proportional to $k^{-7/3}$,\nbut in the decaying cases, the subinertial range spectrum steepens to a novel\n$k^5$ slope instead of the $k^4$ slope in MHD. The energy of the large-scale\nmagnetic field can increase quadratically in time through inverse cascading.\nFor helical fields, the energy dissipation is found to be inversely\nproportional to the large-scale magnetic field and proportional to the fifth\npower of the root-mean square (rms) magnetic field. For neutron star conditions\nwith an rms magnetic field of a few times $10^{14}\\,$G, the large-scale\nmagnetic field might only be $10^{11}\\,$G, while still producing magnetic\ndissipation of $10^{33}\\,$erg$\\,$s$^{-1}$ for thousands of years, which could\nmanifest itself through X-ray emission.

To achieve this aim, a previous study has proven an upper bound of the\ntarget-domain risk, and the open set difference, as an important term in the\nupper bound, is used to measure the risk on unknown target data. By minimizing\nthe upper bound, a shallow classifier can be trained to achieve the aim.\nHowever, if the classifier is very flexible (e.g., deep neural networks\n(DNNs)), the open set difference will converge to a negative value when\nminimizing the upper bound, which causes an issue where most target data are\nrecognized as unknown data. To address this issue, we propose a new upper bound\nof target-domain risk for UOSDA, which includes four terms: source-domain risk,\n$\\epsilon$-open set difference ($\\Delta_\\epsilon$), a distributional\ndiscrepancy between domains, and a constant. Compared to the open set\ndifference, $\\Delta_\\epsilon$ is more robust against the issue when it is being\nminimized, and thus we are able to use very flexible classifiers (i.e., DNNs).\nThen, we propose a new principle-guided deep UOSDA method that trains DNNs via\nminimizing the new upper bound. Specifically, source-domain risk and\n$\\Delta_\\epsilon$ are minimized by gradient descent, and the distributional\ndiscrepancy is minimized via a novel open-set conditional adversarial training\nstrategy. Finally, compared to existing shallow and deep UOSDA methods, our\nmethod shows the state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets,\nincluding digit recognition (MNIST, SVHN, USPS), object recognition (Office-31,\nOffice-Home), and face recognition (PIE).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2020 14:01:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-24"}

However, our results indicate that,\nunlike in the incoherent case, the error-correction thresholds for the various\ngraphs do not approach a universal bound.

Experiments on a\nbenchmark dataset show that our method consistently outperforms several popular\ndomain adaptation strategies.

On busy highways, however, congestion events can cause large,\nshort-term spikes in travel time. These spikes make direct forecasting of\ntravel time using standard time series models difficult on the timescales of\nhours to days that are relevant to forward planning. The problem is that some\nsuch spikes are caused by unpredictable incidents and should be filtered out,\nwhereas others are caused by recurrent peaks in demand and should be factored\ninto estimates. Here we present the Wavelet Augmented Regression Profiling\n(WARP) method for long-term estimation of typical travel times. WARP linearly\ndecomposes historical time series of travel times into two components:\nbackground and spikes. It then further separates the spikes into contributions\nfrom recurrent and residual congestion. This is achieved using a combination of\nwavelet transforms, spectral filtering and locally weighted regression. The\nbackground and recurrent congestion contributions are then used to estimate\ntypical travel times with horizon of one week in an accurate and\ncomputationally inexpensive manner. We train and test WARP on the M6 and M11\nmotorways in the United Kingdom using 12 weeks of link level travel time data\nobtained from the UK's National Traffic Information Service (NTIS). In\nout-of-sample validation tests, WARP compares favourably to estimates produced\nby a simple segmentation method and to the estimates published by NTIS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2020 14:50:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-03"}

In addition, we show that MCGL's tolerance to graph\nstructure noise is weaker than GCN on noisy graphs (four real-world datasets).\nMoreover, inspired by MCGL, we re-analyze the reasons why the performance of\nGCN becomes worse when deepened too much: rather than the mainstream view of\nover-smoothing, we argue that the main reason is the graph structure noise, and\nexperimentally verify our view.

Recent\nwork has shown that widely used scaling methods underestimate their calibration\nerror, while alternative Histogram Binning (HB) methods often fail to preserve\nclassification accuracy. When classes have small prior probabilities, HB also\nfaces the issue of severe sample-inefficiency after the conversion into K\none-vs-rest class-wise calibration problems. The goal of this paper is to\nresolve the identified issues of HB in order to provide calibrated confidence\nestimates using only a small holdout calibration dataset for bin optimization\nwhile preserving multi-class ranking accuracy. From an information-theoretic\nperspective, we derive the I-Max concept for binning, which maximizes the\nmutual information between labels and quantized logits. This concept mitigates\npotential loss in ranking performance due to lossy quantization, and by\ndisentangling the optimization of bin edges and representatives allows\nsimultaneous improvement of ranking and calibration performance. To improve the\nsample efficiency and estimates from a small calibration set, we propose a\nshared class-wise (sCW) calibration strategy, sharing one calibrator among\nsimilar classes (e.g., with similar class priors) so that the training sets of\ntheir class-wise calibration problems can be merged to train the single\ncalibrator. The combination of sCW and I-Max binning outperforms the state of\nthe art calibration methods on various evaluation metrics across different\nbenchmark datasets and models, using a small calibration set (e.g., 1k samples\nfor ImageNet).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2020 15:31:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2020 16:14:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2020 18:38:59 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 6 Dec 2020 13:46:16 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 2021 22:39:28 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Mon, 8 Mar 2021 08:39:50 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Thu, 24 Nov 2022 13:50:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-28"}

The code also provides a\ncomplete user-friendly interactive interface, including graphical feedback,\nthat helps the user to choose the parameters as easily as possible. To\nfacilitate the normalisation even further, RASSINE can provide a first guess\nfor the parameters that are derived directly from the merged 1D spectrum based\non previously performed calibrations. Results: For HARPS spectra of the Sun\nthat were obtained with the HELIOS solar telescope, a continuum accuracy of\n0.20% on line depth can be reached after normalisation with RASSINE. This is\nthree times better than with the commonly used method of polynomial fitting.\nFor HARPS spectra of $\\alpha$ Cen B, a continuum accuracy of 2.0% is reached.\nThis rather poor accuracy is mainly due to molecular band absorption and the\nhigh density of spectral lines in the bluest part of the merged 1D spectrum.\nWhen wavelengths shorter than 4500 \\AA are excluded, the continuum accuracy\nimproves by up to 1.2%.

Then, by attributing thermodynamics to the stretched horizon of future\nlightcones -- a timelike hypersurface generated by a collection of radially\naccelerating observers with constant and uniform proper acceleration -- I\nderive Einstein's equations from the Clausius relation $T\\Delta\nS_{\\text{rev}}=Q$, where $\\Delta S_{\\text{rev}}$ is the reversible entropy\nchange.

With targeted prediction, the goal is to\noptimize predictions for specific decision tasks of interest, which we\nrepresent via functionals. Although classical decision analysis extracts\npredictions from a Bayesian model, these predictions are often difficult to\ninterpret and slow to compute. Instead, we design a class of parametrized\nactions for Bayesian decision analysis that produce optimal, scalable, and\nsimple targeted predictions. For a wide variety of action parametrizations and\nloss functions--including linear actions with sparsity constraints for targeted\nvariable selection--we derive a convenient representation of the optimal\ntargeted prediction that yields efficient and interpretable solutions.\nCustomized out-of-sample predictive metrics are developed to evaluate and\ncompare among targeted predictors. Through careful use of the posterior\npredictive distribution, we introduce a procedure that identifies a set of\nnear-optimal, or acceptable targeted predictors, which provide unique insights\ninto the features and level of complexity needed for accurate targeted\nprediction. Simulations demonstrate excellent prediction, estimation, and\nvariable selection capabilities. Targeted predictions are constructed for\nphysical activity data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination\nSurvey (NHANES) to better predict and understand the characteristics of\nintraday physical activity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2020 15:55:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 10 Oct 2020 16:39:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-18"}

Knowledge\ndistillation, which aims at training a smaller student network by transferring\nknowledge from a larger teacher model, is one of the promising solutions for\nmodel miniaturization. In this paper, we investigate each module of a typical\ndetector in depth, and propose a general distillation framework that adaptively\ntransfers knowledge from teacher to student according to the task specific\npriors. The intuition is that simply distilling all information from teacher to\nstudent is not advisable, instead we should only borrow priors from the teacher\nmodel where the student cannot perform well. Towards this goal, we propose a\nregion proposal sharing mechanism to interflow region responses between the\nteacher and student models. Based on this, we adaptively transfer knowledge at\nthree levels, \\emph{i.e.}, feature backbone, classification head, and bounding\nbox regression head, according to which model performs more reasonably.\nFurthermore, considering that it would introduce optimization dilemma when\nminimizing distillation loss and detection loss simultaneously, we propose a\ndistillation decay strategy to help improve model generalization via gradually\nreducing the distillation penalty. Experiments on widely used detection\nbenchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. In particular, using\nFaster R-CNN with FPN as an instantiation, we achieve an accuracy of $39.0\\%$\nwith Resnet-50 on COCO dataset, which surpasses the baseline $36.3\\%$ by\n$2.7\\%$ points, and even better than the teacher model with $38.5\\%$ mAP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2020 15:58:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-24"}

Recently, deep\nlearning techniques have shown significant prediction improvements over\ntraditional models, however, open questions remain around their applicability,\naccuracy and parameter tuning. This paper brings two contributions in terms of:\n1) applying an outlier detection an anomaly adjustment method based on incoming\nand historical data streams, and 2) proposing an advanced deep learning\nframework for simultaneously predicting the traffic flow, speed and occupancy\non a large number of monitoring stations along a highly circulated motorway in\nSydney, Australia, including exit and entry loop count stations, and over\nvarying training and prediction time horizons.

The beta prime phase is stable up to 110GPa. Above 110GPa the\nbcc-beta double prime is dominant and stable up to about 220GPa. The derived\nbcc-double prime bulk moduli are confirmed by the Lindemann-Gilvarry criterion\nas Bo and Bo prime simultaneously fit both the P-V EOS and the P-T melting data\npoints (combined approach). The calculated melting curve of elemental Zr,\ntaking into account the thermal pressure Poth shift and the elevated melting\nTmo prime at Poth , yield very good fit of the experimental melting data\npermitting a safe extrapolation to high pressures and temperatures. In\naddition, the combined approach lead to direct determination of the Greuneisen\nparameter gammao, needed for applying the approximated Lindemann-Gilvarry\nmelting formula.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2020 12:30:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Nov 2020 09:36:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-14"}

A two-dimensional microstructural model of a fibrous network is\ntherefore developed to upscale the hygro-expansion of individual fibres,\nthrough their interaction, to the resulting overall expansion of the network.\nThe fibres are modelled with rectangular shapes and are assumed to be perfectly\nbonded where they overlap. For realistic networks the number of bonds is large\nand the network is geometrically so complex that discretizing it by\nconventional, geometry-conforming, finite elements is cumbersome. The\ncombination of a level-set and XFEM formalism enables the use of regular,\nstructured grids in order to model the complex microstructural geometry. In\nthis approach, the fibres are described implicitly by a level-set function. In\norder to represent the fibre boundaries in the fibrous network, an XFEM\ndiscretization is used together with a Heaviside enrichment function. Numerical\nresults demonstrate that the proposed approach successfully captures the\nhygro-expansive properties of the network with fewer degrees of freedom\ncompared to classical FEM, preserving desired accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2020 14:59:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-26"}

Macroeconomic models that use preexisting epidemic models to calculate\nthe impacts of a disease outbreak are therefore extremely useful for\npolicymakers seeking to evaluate the best course of action in such a crisis. We\ndevelop an SIR model of the COVID-19 pandemic that explicitly considers herd\nimmunity, behavior-dependent transmission rates, remote workers, and indirect\nexternalities of lockdown. This model is presented as an exit time control\nproblem where lockdown ends when the population achieves herd immunity, either\nnaturally or via a vaccine. A social planner prescribes separate levels of\nlockdown for two separate sections of the adult population: low-risk (ages\n20-64) and high-risk (ages 65 and over). These levels are determined via\noptimization of an objective function which assigns a macroeconomic cost to the\nlevel of lockdown and the number of deaths. We find that, by ending lockdowns\nonce herd immunity is reached, high-risk individuals are able to leave lockdown\nsignificantly before the arrival of a vaccine without causing large increases\nin mortality. Moreover, if we incorporate a behavior-dependent transmission\nrate which represents increased personal caution in response to increased\ninfection levels, both output loss and total mortality are lowered. Lockdown\nefficacy is further increased when there is less interaction between low- and\nhigh-risk individuals, and increased remote work decreases output losses.\nOverall, our model predicts that a lockdown which ends at the arrival of herd\nimmunity, combined with individual actions to slow virus transmission, can\nreduce total mortality to one-third of the no-lockdown level, while allowing\nhigh-risk individuals to leave lockdown well before vaccine arrival.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2020 03:36:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

When considering concrete motor actions, this knowledge has been\ncalled the object affordance. Can this notion be generalized to any type of\ninteraction that one can have with an object? In this paper we introduce a\nmethod to represent objects in a space where each dimension corresponds to a\nbroad mode of interaction, based on verb selectional preferences in text\ncorpora. This object embedding makes it possible to predict human judgments of\nverb applicability to objects better than a variety of alternative approaches.\nFurthermore, we show that the dimensions in this space can be used to predict\ncategorical and functional dimensions in a state-of-the-art mental\nrepresentation of objects, derived solely from human judgements of object\nsimilarity. These results suggest that interaction knowledge accounts for a\nlarge part of mental representations of objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2020 22:05:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 May 2021 13:06:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-12"}

In the numerical experiments, we control the system pressure by\nimposing a constant force on a moving piston. The simulations reveal that the\npresence of a nanostructure triggers the bubble formation, determines the\nnucleation site and facilitates the energy transfer from the hot substrate to\nthe water. The surface chemistry, on the other hand, governs the shape of the\nformed bubble. A hydrophilic surface chemistry accelerates the bubble\nnucleation, however, decelerates the bubble expansion, thus postponing the\nformation of the film of vapour. Therefore, a hydrophilic surface provides\nbetter energy transfer from the hot wall to the water. By analysing the system\nenergy, we show that irrespective of wall topology and chemistry, there is a\nwall temperature for which the amount of transferred energy is maximum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2020 09:58:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-10"}

When the droplet cannot find any local energy minimum point on the\nsurface, the droplet starts to slide. Based on the Laplace pressure equation,\nthe shape of a two-dimensional Cassie-Baxter droplet on a textured surface is\npredicted. Then the stability of the droplet is examined by considering the\ninterference between the liquid and the surface microstructure as well as\nanalyzing the free energy change upon the de-pinning. Afterward, the\ntheoretical analysis is validated against the line-tension based front tracking\nmethod simulation (LTM), that seamlessly captures the attachment and detachment\nbetween the liquid and the substrate. We answer to the open debates on the\nsliding research field: (i) Whether the sliding initiates with the front end\nslip or the rear end slip, and (ii) whether the advancing and receding contact\nangles measured on the horizontal surface are comparable with the front and\nrear contact angle of the droplet at the onset of sliding. Additionally, a new\ndroplet translation mechanism promoted by cycle of condensation and evaporation\nis suggested.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2020 04:59:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-10"}
