Some of the popular notions that\ncorrelate well with the performance on unseen data are (i) the `flatness' of\nthe local minimum found by SGD, which is related to the eigenvalues of the\nHessian, (ii) the ratio of the stepsize $\\eta$ to the batch-size $b$, which\nessentially controls the magnitude of the stochastic gradient noise, and (iii)\nthe `tail-index', which measures the heaviness of the tails of the network\nweights at convergence. In this paper, we argue that these three seemingly\nunrelated perspectives for generalization are deeply linked to each other. We\nclaim that depending on the structure of the Hessian of the loss at the\nminimum, and the choices of the algorithm parameters $\\eta$ and $b$, the SGD\niterates will converge to a \\emph{heavy-tailed} stationary distribution. We\nrigorously prove this claim in the setting of quadratic optimization: we show\nthat even in a simple linear regression problem with independent and\nidentically distributed data whose distribution has finite moments of all\norder, the iterates can be heavy-tailed with infinite variance. We further\ncharacterize the behavior of the tails with respect to algorithm parameters,\nthe dimension, and the curvature. We then translate our results into insights\nabout the behavior of SGD in deep learning. We support our theory with\nexperiments conducted on synthetic data, fully connected, and convolutional\nneural networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jun 2020 16:43:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Oct 2020 16:04:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2021 02:36:01 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 8 Jun 2021 15:34:12 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 14 Jun 2021 15:45:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-15"}

This can lead to real-world consequences when importance\nis inappropriately interpreted as impact for business or medical insight\npurposes. The dominant approach for computing importances is through\ninterrogation of a fitted model, which works well for feature selection, but\ngives distorted measures of feature impact.

The most\ncommon implementation is the backpropagation algorithm for training\nfeed-forward neural networks in a supervised fashion. Backpropagation involves\ncomputing the gradient of a loss function, with respect to the weights of the\nnetwork, to update the weights and thus minimize loss. Although the mean square\nerror is often used as a loss function, the general stochastic gradient descent\nprinciple does not immediately connect with a specific loss function. Another\ndrawback of backpropagation has been the search for optimal values of two\nimportant training parameters, learning rate and momentum weight, which are\ndetermined empirically in most systems. The learning rate specifies the step\nsize towards a minimum of the loss function when following the gradient, while\nthe momentum weight considers previous weight changes when updating current\nweights. Using both parameters in conjunction with each other is generally\naccepted as a means to improving training, although their specific values do\nnot follow immediately from standard backpropagation theory. This paper\nproposes a new information-theoretical loss function motivated by neural signal\nprocessing in a synapse. The new loss function implies a specific learning rate\nand momentum weight, leading to empirical parameters often used in practice.\nThe proposed framework also provides a more formal explanation of the momentum\nterm and its smoothing effect on the training process.

A Linguistic Attribute\nHierarchy (LAH), embedded with Linguistic Decision Trees (LDTs), can represent\na new attribute deep learning. In contrast to the conventional deep learning,\nan LAH could overcome the shortcoming of missing interpretation by providing\ntransparent information propagation through the rules, produced by LDTs in the\nLAH. Similar to the conventional deep learning, the computing complexity of\noptimising LAHs blocks the applications of LAHs. In this paper, we propose a\nheuristic approach to constructing an LAH, embedded with LDTs for decision\nmaking or classification by utilising the distance correlations between\nattributes and between attributes and the goal variable. The set of attributes\nis divided to some attribute clusters, and then they are heuristically\norganised to form a linguistic attribute hierarchy. The proposed approach was\nvalidated with some benchmark decision making or classification problems from\nthe UCI machine learning repository. The experimental results show that the\nproposed self-organisation algorithm can construct an effective and efficient\nlinguistic attribute hierarchy. Such a self-organised linguistic attribute\nhierarchy embedded with LDTs can not only efficiently tackle \"curse of\ndimensionality\" in a single LDT for data fusion with massive attributes, but\nalso achieve better or comparable performance on decision making or\nclassification, compared to the single LDT for the problem to be solved. The\nself-organisation algorithm is much efficient than the Genetic Algorithm in\nWrapper for the optimisation of LAHs.

SLEs are exact yet non-closed, since they contain averaged terms\nthat are expressed via higher-order pdfs. These averaged terms are further\nevaluated by employing generalizations of the Novikov-Furutsu (NF) theorem.\nAfter the NF theorem, SLE averages are expressed equivalently as nonlocal terms\ndepending on the whole history of the response (in some cases, on the history\nof excitation too). Then, nonlocal terms are approximated by a novel closure\nscheme, employing the history of appropriate moments of the response (or joint\nresponse-excitation moments). Application of this scheme results in a family of\nnovel pdf evolution equations. These equations are nonlinear and retain a\ntractable amount of the original nonlocality of SLEs, being also in closed form\nand solvable.

Here, we show that a comparison of gate-dependent\nmeasurements, which were acquired under different measurement conditions can\nencounter significant problems due to the temporal evolution of the charging of\ntrap states inside the dielectric layer or at its interfaces. The impact of,\ne.g., the gate sweep direction and the sweep rate on the overall gate\ndependence gets especially prominent in optical measurements due to\nphoto-excitation of donor and acceptor states. Under such conditions the same\nnominal gate-voltage may lead to different gate-induced charge carrier\ndensities and, hence, Fermi level positions. We demonstrate that a current flow\nfrom or even through the dielectric layer via leakage currents can\nsignificantly diminish the gate tunability in optical measurements of 2D\nmaterials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jun 2020 17:48:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-31"}

These benefits, however,\ncome at the cost of treating deletes as a second-class citizen. A delete\ninserts a tombstone that invalidates older instances of the deleted key.\nState-of-the-art LSM engines do not provide guarantees as to how fast a\ntombstone will propagate to persist the deletion. Further, LSM engines only\nsupport deletion on the sort key. To delete on another attribute (e.g.,\ntimestamp), the entire tree is read and re-written. We highlight that fast\npersistent deletion without affecting read performance is key to support: (i)\nstreaming systems operating on a window of data, (ii) privacy with latency\nguarantees on the right-to-be-forgotten, and (iii) en masse cloud deployment of\ndata systems that makes storage a precious resource.\n  To address these challenges, in this paper, we build a new key-value storage\nengine, Lethe, that uses a very small amount of additional metadata, a set of\nnew delete-aware compaction policies, and a new physical data layout that\nweaves the sort and the delete key order. We show that Lethe supports any\nuser-defined threshold for the delete persistence latency offering higher read\nthroughput ($1.17-1.4\\times$) and lower space amplification ($2.1-9.8\\times$),\nwith a modest increase in write amplification (between $4\\%$ and $25\\%$).

The advent of\nmetamaterials and metastructures is grounded in deep understanding of their\nproperties. Based on the original 1956 formulation by Rytov, it is well known\nthat a photonic lattice with deep subwavelength periodicity can be approximated\nwith a homogeneous space having an effective refractive index. Whereas the\nattendant effective-medium theory (EMT) commonly used in the literature is\nbased on the zeroth root, the closed-form transcendental equations possess an\ninfinite number of roots. Thus far, these higher-order solutions have been\ntotally ignored; even Rytov himself discarded them and proceeded to approximate\nsolutions for the deep-subwavelength regime. In spite of the fact that the\nRytov EMT models an infinite half-space lattice, it is highly relevant to\nmodeling practical thin-film periodic structures with finite thickness as we\nshow. Therefore, here, we establish a theoretical framework to systematically\ndescribe subwavelength resonance behavior and to predict the optical response\nof resonant photonic lattices using the full Rytov solutions. Expeditious\nresults are obtained with direct, new physical insights available for resonant\nlattice properties. We show that the full Rytov formulation implicitly contains\nrefractive-index solutions pertaining directly to evanescent waves that drive\nthe laterally-propagating Bloch modes foundational to resonant lattice\nproperties. In fact, the resonant reradiated Bloch modes experience\nwavelength-dependent refractive indices that are solutions of the Rytov\nexpressions.

An encoder-decoder based approach, like U-Net and\nits variants, is a popular strategy for solving medical image segmentation\ntasks. To improve the performance of U-Net on various segmentation tasks, we\npropose a novel architecture called DoubleU-Net, which is a combination of two\nU-Net architectures stacked on top of each other. The first U-Net uses a\npre-trained VGG-19 as the encoder, which has already learned features from\nImageNet and can be transferred to another task easily. To capture more\nsemantic information efficiently, we added another U-Net at the bottom. We also\nadopt Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) to capture contextual information\nwithin the network. We have evaluated DoubleU-Net using four medical\nsegmentation datasets, covering various imaging modalities such as colonoscopy,\ndermoscopy, and microscopy. Experiments on the MICCAI 2015 segmentation\nchallenge, the CVC-ClinicDB, the 2018 Data Science Bowl challenge, and the\nLesion boundary segmentation datasets demonstrate that the DoubleU-Net\noutperforms U-Net and the baseline models.

The method can be used with any combination of\ncodes, code-rates and decoding techniques. In the approach, a continuous\nrealization of noise is estimated from a lead channel by subtracting its\ndecoded output from its received signal. The estimate is recycled to reduce the\nSignal to Noise Ratio (SNR) of an orthogonal channel that is experiencing\ncorrelated noise and so improve the accuracy of its decoding. In this design,\nchannels only aid each other only through the provision of noise estimates\npost-decoding.\n  For a system with arbitrary noise correlation between orthogonal channels\nexperiencing potentially distinct conditions, we introduce an algorithm that\ndetermines a static decoding order that maximizes total effective SNR. We prove\nthat this solution results in higher effective SNR than independent decoding,\nwhich in turn leads to a larger rate region.

As a function of the drive\nand damping, the phase diagram of this paradigmatic model is well known to\npresent a pinned, a sliding, and a bistable regime separated by three distinct\nbifurcation lines. In physical terms, the average velocity $v$ of the particle\nis nonzero only if either (i) the driving force is large enough to remove any\nstable point, forcing the particle to slide, or (ii) there are local minima but\nthe damping is small enough, below a critical damping, for the inertia to allow\nthe particle to cross barriers and follow a limit cycle; this regime is\nbistable and whether $v > 0$ or $v = 0$ depends on the initial state.

First, we study its behavior near the \"triple point\"\nwhere the pinned, the bistable, and the sliding dynamical regimes meet. Just\nbelow the critical damping we uncover a critical regime, where the line\napproaches the triple point following a power-law behavior.

A\nsignificant fraction of these nuclei also contain a nuclear stellar cluster\n(NSC) surrounding the SMBH. In this paper, we consider the idea that the NSC\nforms first, from the merger of several stellar clusters that may contain\nintermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs). These IMBHs can subsequently grow in the\nNSC and form an SMBH. We carry out $N$-body simulations of the simultaneous\nmerger of three stellar clusters to form an NSC, and investigate the outcome of\nsimulated runs containing zero, one, two and three IMBHs. We find that IMBHs\ncan efficiently sink to the centre of the merged cluster. If multiple merging\nclusters contain an IMBH, we find that an IMBH binary is likely to form and\nsubsequently merge by gravitational wave emission. We show that these mergers\nare catalyzed by dynamical interactions with surrounding stars, which\nsystematically harden the binary and increase its orbital eccentricity. The\nseed SMBH will be ejected from the NSC by the recoil kick produced when two\nIMBHs merge, if their mass ratio $q\\gtrsim 0.15$. If the seed is ejected then\nno SMBH will form in the NSC. This is a natural pathway to explain those\ngalactic nuclei that contain an NSC but apparently lack an SMBH, such as M33.\nHowever, if an IMBH is retained then it can seed the growth of an SMBH through\ngas accretion and tidal disruption of stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jun 2020 20:39:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2021 17:52:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-27"}

Designing beams\nfor millimeter wave and terahertz communication using massive phased arrays,\nhowever, is challenging due to hardware constraints and the wide bandwidth in\nthese systems. For example, beams which are optimal at the center frequency may\nperform poor in wideband communication systems where the radio frequencies\ndiffer substantially from the center frequency. The poor performance in such\nsystems is due to differences in the optimal beamformers corresponding to\ndistinct radio frequencies within the wide bandwidth. Such a mismatch leads to\na misfocus effect in near field systems and the beam squint effect in far field\nsystems. In this paper, we investigate the misfocus effect and propose InFocus,\na low complexity technique to construct beams that are well suited for massive\nwideband phased arrays. The beams are constructed using a carefully designed\nfrequency modulated waveform in the spatial dimension. For the special case of\nbeamforming along the boresight of an array, this waveform is analogous to the\nfrequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) chirp signal in radar.

In particular, our interest centers on features of the\ndistribution of the individual-level effect of job displacement. Identifying\nfeatures of this distribution is particularly challenging -- e.g., even if we\ncould randomly assign workers to be displaced or not, many of the parameters\nthat we consider would not be point identified. We exploit our access to panel\ndata, and our approach relies on comparing outcomes of displaced workers to\noutcomes the same workers would have experienced if they had not been displaced\nand if they maintained the same rank in the distribution of earnings as they\nhad before they were displaced. Using data from the Displaced Workers Survey,\nwe find that displaced workers earn about $157 per week less, on average, than\nthey would have earned if they had not been displaced. We also find that there\nis substantial heterogeneity. We estimate that 42% of workers have higher\nearnings than they would have had if they had not been displaced and that a\nlarge fraction of workers have experienced substantially more negative effects\nthan the average effect of displacement. Finally, we also document major\ndifferences in the distribution of the effect of job displacement across\neducation levels, sex, age, and counterfactual earnings levels.

A scalable system has\nincreasing performance with increasing system size. In an ideal case, the\nincrease in performance (e.g., speedup) corresponds to the number of units that\nare added to the system. However, if multiple units work on the same task, then\ncoordination among these units is required. This coordination can introduce\noverheads with an impact on system performance. The coordination costs can lead\nto sublinear improvement or even diminishing performance with increasing system\nsize. However, there are also systems that implement efficient coordination and\nexploit collaboration of units to attain superlinear improvement. Modeling the\nscalability dynamics is key to understanding efficient systems. Known laws of\nscalability, such as Amdahl's law, Gustafson's law, and Gunther's Universal\nScalability Law, are minimalistic phenomenological models that explain a rich\nvariety of system behaviors through concise equations. While useful to gain\ngeneral insights, the phenomenological nature of these models may limit the\nunderstanding of the underlying dynamics, as they are detached from first\nprinciples that could explain coordination overheads among units. Through a\ndecentralized system approach, we propose a general model based on generic\ninteractions between units that is able to describe, as specific cases, any\ngeneral pattern of scalability included by previously reported laws. The\nproposed general model of scalability is built on first principles, or at least\non a microscopic description of interaction between units, and therefore has\nthe potential to contribute to a better understanding of system behavior and\nscalability. We show that this model can be applied to a diverse set of\nsystems, such as parallel supercomputers, robot swarms, or wireless sensor\nnetworks, creating a unified view on interdisciplinary design for scalability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jun 2020 22:28:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Jun 2021 14:25:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-14"}

Strong\nconfinement in the out-of-plane direction enhances the Coulomb potential\nbetween the charged particles (e-h pairs) and thus increases the exciton\nbinding energy dramatically. The lattice inversion asymmetry in a monolayer\ncreates two non-equivalent (but degenerate in energy) band edges protected by\ntime reversal polarisation via pseudo-spin. However, the presence of strong\nspin-orbit coupling in the valence band and weak spin-splitting in the\nconduction band results in the lowest lying exciton in WX2 (X = S, Se) being\nspin forbidden and optically dark. Because of their long life times, dark\nexcitons (XD) are highly attractive for quantum optics and optoelectronic\napplications. To date studying XD emission is limited to cryogenic temperature\nor required very complex experimental configurations to observe them at room\ntemperature (RT). Here, we demonstrate a novel approach of radiative decay of\nXD related emissions in 1L-WSe2 studied by micro and nano PL at RT. 1L-WSe2\nflakes were sandwiched by noble metal (Au or Ag) substrates and PDMS\nnano-patches providing a strong local out-of-plane dipole moment with respect\nto the 2D plane. This strong dipole moment not only enhances the XD in WSe2, it\nalso produces bound excitons due to extrinsic charge defects visible at RT. The\nspatial distributions of these XD related emissions were studied by TEPL with a\nspatial resolution < 10 nm confirming the confinement of these excitons within\nthe PDMS nano-patches. Finally, by removing the nano-patches from the top of\nthe flakes we are able to recover the bright excitons in the 1L-WSe2. Our\napproach paves the way for deep understanding and to harness excitonic\nproperties in low dimensional semiconductors, thus offering a platform towards\nquantum optics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jun 2020 22:55:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2020 23:12:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-05"}

As such systems require high levels of\nresilience to errors, CNNs must execute correctly in the presence of hardware\nfaults. Full duplication provides the needed assurance but incurs a prohibitive\n100% overhead. Algorithmic techniques are known to offer low-cost solutions,\nbut the practical feasibility and performance of such techniques have never\nbeen studied for CNN deployment platforms (e.g., TensorFlow or TensorRT on\nGPUs). In this paper, we focus on algorithmically verifying Convolutions, which\nare the most resource-demanding operations in CNNs.

The lockdown\npresupposes a drastic reduction in community interactions, representing a more\nextreme measure of social distancing.

The first hypothesis of this study is that countries\nwith a lockdown decree can achieve greater success in reducing the mobility of\nthe population, and the second hypothesis is that Argentina, Brazil and\nColombia have regional mobility patterns. The first hypothesis was partially\nconfirmed (considering 10 countries in South America), and the results obtained\nin the spatial analyzes confirmed the second hypothesis.

These features have been called\n\"switchbacks,\" and their origin is a mystery. But their widespread nature\nsuggests that they may be generated by a frequently occurring process in the\nSun's atmosphere. We examine the possibility that the switchbacks originate\nfrom coronal jets. Recent work suggests that many coronal jets result when\nphotospheric magnetic flux cancels, and forms a small-scale \"minifilament\" flux\nrope that erupts and reconnects with coronal field. We argue that the\nreconnected erupting minifilament flux rope can manifest as an outward\npropagating Alfv\\'enic fluctuation that steepens into an increasingly compact\ndisturbance as it moves through the solar wind. Using previous observed\nproperties of coronal jets that connect to coronagraph-observed white-light\njets (a.k.a. \"narrow CMEs\"), along with typical solar wind speed values, we\nexpect the coronal-jet-produced disturbances to traverse near-perihelion PSP in\n~<25 min, with a velocity of ~400 km/s. To consider further the plausibility of\nthis idea, we show that a previously studied series of equatorial latitude\ncoronal jets, originating from the periphery of an active region, generate\nwhite-light jets in the outer corona (seen in STEREO/COR2 coronagraph images;\n2.5---15 R_sun), and into the inner heliosphere (seen in STEREO/Hi1\nheliospheric imager images; 15---84 R_sun). Thus it is tenable that\ndisturbances put onto open coronal magnetic field lines by\ncoronal-jet-producing erupting minifilament flux ropes can propagate out to PSP\nspace and appear as switchbacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jun 2020 23:31:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-24"}

Training/testing\ncohorts included 927/100 COVID-19, 388/33 ILD, 189/33 other pneumonias, and\n559/34 normal (no pathologies) CTs. A metric-based approach for classification\nof COVID-19 used interpretable features, relying on logistic regression and\nrandom forests. A deep learning-based classifier differentiated COVID-19 via 3D\nfeatures extracted directly from CT attenuation and probability distribution of\nairspace opacities.\n  Results: Most discriminative features of COVID-19 are percentage of airspace\nopacity and peripheral and basal predominant opacities, concordant with the\ntypical characterization of COVID-19 in the literature.

The FLHA\nwith SON functionality also overcomes the limitations of the conventional FLHA\nthat must rely heavily on professional experience to design. The simulation\nresults show that the proposed self-optimised FLHA can effectively generate MF\nand fuzzy rules for the FLHA.

Humeanism allows\nus to incorporate the Past Hypothesis and the Statistical Postulate into the\nbest system, which we then use to simplify the quantum state of the universe.\nThis enables us to confer the nomological status to the quantum state in a way\nthat adds no significant complexity to the best system and solves the\n\"supervenient-kind problem\" facing the original version of the Past Hypothesis.\nWe call the resultant theory the Humean unification. It provides a unified\nexplanation of time asymmetry and quantum entanglement. On this theory, what\ngives rise to time's arrow is also responsible for quantum phenomena. The new\ntheory has a separable mosaic, a best system that is simple and non-vague, less\ntension between quantum mechanics and special relativity, and a higher degree\nof theoretical and dynamical unity. The Humean unification leads to new\ninsights that can be useful to Humeans and non-Humeans alike.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2020 03:17:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Sep 2020 22:30:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-25"}

Despite the non-invasive\nadvantage of MRI in frequent imaging, the low contrast MR images in the target\narea make tissue segmentation a challenging problem. This paper demonstrates\nthe potential benefits of image-to-image translation techniques to generate\nsynthetic high tissue contrast (HTC) images. Notably, we adopt a new cycle\ngenerative adversarial network (CycleGAN) with an attention mechanism to\nincrease the contrast within underlying tissues. The attention block, as well\nas training on HTC images, guides our model to converge on certain tissues. To\nincrease the resolution of HTC images, we employ multi-stage architecture to\nfocus on one particular tissue as a foreground and filter out the irrelevant\nbackground in each stage. This multi-stage structure also alleviates the common\nartifacts of the synthetic images by decreasing the gap between source and\ntarget domains. We show the application of our method for synthesizing HTC\nimages on brain MR scans, including glioma tumor. We also employ HTC MR images\nin both the end-to-end and two-stage segmentation structure to confirm the\neffectiveness of these images. The experiments over three competitive\nsegmentation baselines on BraTS 2018 dataset indicate that incorporating the\nsynthetic HTC images in the multi-modal segmentation framework improves the\naverage Dice scores 0.8%, 0.6%, and 0.5% on the whole tumor, tumor core, and\nenhancing tumor, respectively, while eliminating one real MRI sequence from the\nsegmentation procedure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2020 03:21:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-11"}

We propose a novel\nmethodology to overcome the above challenges. The key insight of our approach\nis that the process of DRL model extraction is equivalent to imitation\nlearning, a well-established solution to learn sequential decision-making\npolicies. Based on this observation, our methodology first builds a classifier\nto reveal the training algorithm family of the targeted black-box DRL model\nonly based on its predicted actions, and then leverages state-of-the-art\nimitation learning techniques to replicate the model from the identified\nalgorithm family.

The approach rests on a few key\ningredients: (1) Rather than modelling the dynamics of the fields, ED models\nthe dynamics of their probabilities. (2) In accordance with the standard\nentropic methods of inference the dynamics is dictated by information encoded\nin constraints. (3) The choice of the physically relevant constraints is\ndictated by principles of symmetry and invariance. The first such principle\nimposes the preservation of a symplectic structure which leads to a Hamiltonian\nformalism with its attendant Poisson brackets and action principle. The second\nsymmetry principle is foliation invariance, which following earlier work by\nHojman, Kuchar, and Teitelboim, is implemented as a requirement of path\nindependence. The result is a hybrid ED model that approaches quantum field\ntheory in one limit and classical general relativity in another, but is not\nfully described by either.

In this paper, we explain the observed\nanti-correlation between $\\Gamma$ and $L_{\\rm 0.5-10keV}$ within the framework\nof the self-similar solution of the advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF)\naround a weakly magnetized NS. The ADAF model intrinsically predicts an\nanti-correlation between $\\Gamma$ and $L_{\\rm 0.5-10keV}$. In the ADAF model,\nthere is a key parameter, $f_{\\rm th}$, which describes the fraction of the\nADAF energy released at the surface of the NS as thermal emission to be\nscattered in the ADAF. We test the effect of $f_{\\rm th}$ on the\nanti-correlation between $\\Gamma$ and $L_{\\rm 0.5-10keV}$.

To\nalleviate these difficulties, we emphasize two desired properties, i.e.,\nrepeatability and reliability, to simultaneously summarize the inherent and\ninteractive characters of local feature detector and descriptor. Guided by\nthese properties, a self-supervised framework, namely self-evolving keypoint\ndetection and description (SEKD), is proposed to learn an advanced local\nfeature model from unlabeled natural images. Additionally, to have performance\nguarantees, novel training strategies have also been dedicatedly designed to\nminimize the gap between the learned feature and its properties.

Without any\nparameter estimation based on individual study data, the developed model\nsimultaneously predicted (1) lung retention profiles of inhaled insoluble\nparticles, (2) particle size-dependent PK of inhaled monodisperse particles,\n(3) PK differences between inhaled fluticasone propionate and budesonide, and\n(4) PK differences between healthy volunteers and asthmatic patients. Finally,\nto identify the most impactful optimization criteria for orally inhaled drugs,\nwe investigated the impact of input parameters on both pulmonary and systemic\nexposure. Solubility of the inhaled drug did not have any relevant impact on\nlocal and systemic PK. Instead, pulmonary dissolution rate, particle size,\ntissue affinity, and systemic clearance were impactful potential optimization\nparameters. In the future, the developed prediction framework should be\nconsidered a powerful tool to identify optimal drug and formulation\ncharacteristics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2020 07:41:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-27"}

We apply BO with fairness\nconstraints to a range of popular models, including random forests, gradient\nboosting, and neural networks, showing that we can obtain accurate and fair\nsolutions by acting solely on the hyperparameters. We also show empirically\nthat our approach is competitive with specialized techniques that enforce\nmodel-specific fairness constraints, and outperforms preprocessing methods that\nlearn fair representations of the input data. Moreover, our method can be used\nin synergy with such specialized fairness techniques to tune their\nhyperparameters. Finally, we study the relationship between fairness and the\nhyperparameters selected by BO. We observe a correlation between regularization\nand unbiased models, explaining why acting on the hyperparameters leads to ML\nmodels that generalize well and are fair.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2020 08:31:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2021 11:56:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 18 Jun 2021 19:46:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-22"}

Based on milliarcsec-resolution imaging observations using very long\nbaseline interferometry (VLBI), it is not always straightforward to distinguish\nbetween a compact double-lobed or a core-jet structure. The quasar J1110+4817\nwas considered a CSO candidate in the literature earlier, but because of the\nlack of clear evidence, it could not be securely classified as a CSO. Here we\npresent a comprehensive analysis of archival multi-frequency VLBI observations\ncombined with accurate Gaia optical astrometric information. Lower-frequency\nVLBI images reveal an extended radio feature nearly perpendicular to the main\nstructural axis of the source, apparently emanating from the brighter northern\nfeature, that is rare among the known CSOs. While the presence of a binary AGN\nsystem cannot be fully excluded, the most plausible explanation is that\nJ1110+4817 is a CSO.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2020 09:35:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-07"}

Although various types of\nrandom walks whose motion is node biased have been proposed, which are still\namenable to analytical solution, most if not all of them rely on the assumption\nof linearity and independence of the walkers. We introduce a novel class of\nnonlinear stochastic processes describing a system of interacting random\nwalkers moving over networks with finite node capacities. The transition\nprobabilities are modulated by nonlinear functions of the available space at\nthe destination node, with a bias parameter that allows to tune the tendency of\nthe walkers to avoid nodes occupied by other walkers. Firstly, we derive the\nmaster equation governing the dynamics of the system, and we determine an\nanalytical expression for the occupation probability of the walkers at\nequilibrium in the most general case, and under different level of network\ncongestions. Then, we study different type of synthetic and real-world\nnetworks, presenting numerical and analytical results for the entropy rate, a\nproxy for the network exploration capacities of the walkers.We find that, for\neach level of the nonlinear bias, there is an optimal crowding that maximises\nthe entropy rate in a given network topology.

This\nallows for the presence of multiple sub-clusters within each class. The\nadaptation can be integrated into a wide range of metric learning losses. The\nproposed sampling method demonstrates clear benefits on various fine-grained\nimage retrieval datasets over a variety of existing losses; qualitative\nretrieval results show that samples with similar visual patterns are indeed\ncloser in the embedding space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2020 09:59:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Aug 2021 14:13:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-30"}

Previous\nworks either concentrate on utilizing the context of a single diffusion\nsequence or using the social network among users for information diffusion\nprediction. However, the diffusion paths of different messages naturally\nconstitute a dynamic diffusion graph. For one thing, previous works cannot\njointly utilize both the social network and diffusion graph for prediction,\nwhich is insufficient to model the complexity of the diffusion process and\nresults in unsatisfactory prediction performance.

Such an architecture demonstrates the\ncapability of detecting the facial landmarks on both visible and thermal\nimages. Particularly, the proposed DMSL model is robust in facial landmark\ndetection where the face is partially occluded, or facing different directions.\nThe experiment conducted on Eurecom's visible and thermal paired database shows\nthe superior performance of DMSL over the state-of-the-art for thermal facial\nlandmark detection. In addition to that, we have annotated a thermal face\ndataset with their respective facial landmark for the purpose of\nexperimentation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2020 11:43:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-11"}

An unequivocal prediction of a\nliquid-water-loaded atmosphere is the existence of a rainbow feature at a\nscattering angle of around 138-144deg. Earthshine allows us to observe the\nprimary rainbow in linear polarisation. We observed polarisation spectra of\nEarthshine using FORS2 at the Very Large Telescope for phase angles from 33deg\nto 65deg (Sun--Earth--Moon angle). The spectra were used to derive the degree\nof polarisation in the B, V, R, and I passbands and the phase curve from 33deg\nto 136deg . The new observations extend to the smallest phases that can be\nobserved from the ground. The degree of polarisation of planet Earth is\nincreasing for decreasing phase angles downwards of 45deg. From comparison of\nthe phase curve observed with models of an Earth-type atmosphere we are able to\ndetermine the refractive index of water and to constrain the mean water droplet\nsizes to 6-7 mum. Furthermore, we can retrieve the mean cloud fraction of\nliquid water clouds to 0.3, and the mean optical depth of the water clouds to\nvalues between 10 and 20. Our observations allow us to discern two\nfundamentally different scattering mechanisms of the atmosphere of planet\nEarth: molecular and particle scattering. The physical and chemical properties\ncan be retrieved with high fidelity through suitable inversion of the phase\ncurve. Observations of polarimetric phase curves of planets beyond the Solar\nSystem shall be extremely valuable for a thorough characterisation of their\natmospheres.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2020 11:48:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}

We\npropose a new explanation for this problem: GNNs are susceptible to a\nbottleneck when aggregating messages across a long path.

As a result, GNNs fail to propagate messages originating from distant\nnodes and perform poorly when the prediction task depends on long-range\ninteraction. In this paper, we highlight the inherent problem of over-squashing\nin GNNs: we demonstrate that the bottleneck hinders popular GNNs from fitting\nlong-range signals in the training data; we further show that GNNs that absorb\nincoming edges equally, such as GCN and GIN, are more susceptible to\nover-squashing than GAT and GGNN; finally, we show that prior work, which\nextensively tuned GNN models of long-range problems, suffers from\nover-squashing, and that breaking the bottleneck improves their\nstate-of-the-art results without any tuning or additional weights.

One important property is the atmospheric\nmass hence pressure and its influence on the climatic conditions.

Increasing the surface pressure up to 4 bar leads\nto an increase in the surface temperature due to increased greenhouse warming.\nAbove this point, Rayleigh scattering dominates and the surface temperature\ndecreases, reaching surface temperatures below 273K (approximately at ~34 bar\nsurface pressure). For ozone, nitrous oxide, water, methane, and carbon\ndioxide, the spectral response either increases with surface temperature or\npressure depending on the species.

The common practice of\nevaluating these maps applies an indirect and coarse way, i.e., obtaining tight\nbounding boxes which can cover high-activation regions and calculating\nintersection-over-union (IoU) scores between the predicted and ground-truth\nboxes. This measurement can evaluate the ability of localization maps to some\nextent, but we argue that the maps should be measured directly and delicately,\ni.e., comparing the maps with the ground-truth object masks pixel-wisely. To\nfulfill the direct evaluation, we annotate pixel-level object masks on the\nILSVRC validation set. We propose to use IoU-Threshold curves for evaluating\nthe real quality of localization maps. Beyond the amended evaluation metric and\nannotated object masks, this work also introduces a novel self-enhancement\nmethod to harvest accurate object localization maps and object boundaries with\nonly category labels as supervision. We propose a two-stage approach to\ngenerate the localization maps by simply comparing the similarity of point-wise\nfeatures between the high-activation and the rest pixels. Based on the\npredicted localization maps, we explore to estimate object boundaries on a very\nlarge dataset. A hard-negative suppression loss is proposed for obtaining fine\nboundaries.

Slater\ndipoles are introduced, the widths of which are derived from the ab-initio\nmonomer density. An additional exchange-repulsion interaction is introduced in\nour model, originating from the overlap of the delocalized dipoles with other\ndipoles and the ground state electron density. This interaction has previously\nbeen neglected in point dipole models, as the lack of spatial extent of the\ndipoles prevents the inclusion of an overlap term.

Previous works have exploited\nthese assets to focus on the possibility of high-rate, large-area deposition\nfor scaling up into mass production. Conversely, here we show that SALD indeed\nrepresents an ideal platform for the selective deposition of functional\nmaterials by proper design and miniaturization of SALD close-proximity heads.\nIn particular, we have used the potential offered by 3D printing to fabricate\ncustom close-proximity SALD injection heads. By using 3D printing, the heads\ncan be easily designed and readily modified to obtain different deposition\nareas, free-form patterns, and even complex multimaterial structures. The heads\ncan be printed in different materials to adjust to the chemistry of the\nprecursors and the deposition conditions used.

Golden documents that contain the correct\nanswers may not be correctly scored by the retrieval component, and the correct\nanswers that have been extracted may be wrongly ranked after other candidate\nanswers by the reranking component. One of the reasons is derived from the\nindependent principle in which each candidate document (or answer) is scored\nindependently without considering its relationship to other documents (or\nanswers). In this work, we propose a knowledge-aided open-domain QA (KAQA)\nmethod which targets at improving relevant document retrieval and candidate\nanswer reranking by considering the relationship between a question and the\ndocuments (termed as question-document graph), and the relationship between\ncandidate documents (termed as document-document graph).

The Reynolds number is imposed locally\nwith three different ramps. The setup is reminiscent of transient channel flow,\nbut with a space dependent viscosity rather than a time dependent viscosity. It\nis also relevant to various applications in nuclear engineering and in\nparticular in test reactors, where the viscosity changes significantly in the\nstreamwise direction, and there is a severe lack of Direct Numerical Simulation\n(DNS) data to benchmark turbulence models in these conditions.\n  As part of this work we set up a novel benchmark case: the channel is\nextended in the stream-wise direction up to 20p. The viscosity is kept constant\nin the first 4p region. This inlet region is used as a cyclic region to obtain\na fully developed flow profile at the beginning of the ramping region. In the\nramping region the Reynolds number is linearly increased along the channel. The\nflow is homogenous in the spanwise direction, while it is nonhomogenous in the\nstream-wise and wall-normal direction.

Similarly to transient\nchannel flow, the results show that a variation in the Reynolds across a\nchannel does not cause an immediate change in the size of turbulent structures\nin the ramp region and a delay is in fact observed in both wall shear and\nfriction Reynolds number.

We focus on revealing such signatures, if any, in a\nsample of iETGs, and we quantitatively revise their galaxy classification. We\nobserved 20 (out of 104) iETGs, selected from the AMIGA catalog, with the 4KCCD\ncamera at the VATT in the SDSS g and r bands. These are the deepest\nobservations of a sample of iETGs so far. The analysis was performed using the\nAIDA package, providing PSF-corrected 2D surface photometry up to the galaxy\noutskirts. The package provides a model of the 2D galaxy light distribution,\nwhich after model subtraction enhances the fine and peculiar structures in the\nresidual image of the galaxies. Our re-classification suggests that the sample\nis composed of bona fide ETGs spanning from ellipticals to late-S0s galaxies.\nMost of the surface brightness profiles are best fitted with a bulge plus disc\nmodel, suggesting the presence of an underlying disc structure. The residuals\nobtained after the model subtraction show the nearly ubiquitous presence of\nfine structures, such as shells, stellar fans, rings, and tails. Shell systems\nare revealed in about 60% of these galaxies. Because interaction, accretion,\nand merging events are widely interpreted as the origin of the fans, ripples,\nshells and tails in galaxies, we suggest that most of these iETGs have\nexperienced such events. Because they are isolated (after 2-3 Gyr), these\ngalaxies are the cleanest environment in which to study phenomena connected\nwith events like these.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2020 14:58:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-19"}

Prior work has conjectured that regularization techniques, which\ncombat overfitting, may also mitigate the leakage. While many regularization\nmechanisms exist, their effectiveness against MIAs has not been studied\nsystematically, and the resulting privacy properties are not well understood.\nWe explore the lower bound for information leakage that practical attacks can\nachieve. First, we evaluate the effectiveness of 8 mechanisms in mitigating two\nrecent MIAs, on three standard image classification tasks.

With a mass too close to and a width smaller than the\naxial-vector ground state $a_1(1260)$, it was immediately interpreted as a new\nlight exotic meson, similar to the $X$, $Y$, $Z$ states in the hidden-charm\nsector. We show that a resonance-like signal fully matching the experimental\ndata is produced by the decay of the $a_1(1260)$ resonance into $K^\\ast(\\to\nK\\pi)\\bar{K}$ and subsequent rescattering through a triangle singularity into\nthe coupled $f_0(980)\\pi$ channel.

Geometrically this symmetry is often\nmodelled with current groups and current algebras, which are used to capture\nboth the idea of gauge invariance and the algebraic structure of gauge currents\nrelated to the symmetry.\n  The Hamiltonian anomaly is a well-known problem in the quantisation of\nmassless fermion fields, originally manifesting as additional terms in current\nalgebra commutators. The appearance of these anomalous terms is a signal of two\nthings: that the gauge invariance of quantised Hamiltonian operators is broken,\nand that consequently it is not possible to coherently define a vacuum state\nover the physical configuration space of equivalent gauge connections.\n  In this thesis we explore the geometric and topological origins of the\nHamiltonian anomaly, emphasising the usefulness of higher geometric structures.\nGiven this context we also discuss higher versions of the gauge-theoretic\ncurrent groups. These constructions are partially motivated by the $2$-group\nmodels of the abstract string group, and we extend some of these ideas to\ncurrent groups on the three-sphere $S^3$.\n  The study of the Hamiltonian anomaly utilises a wide variety of tools from\nsuch fields as differential geometry, group cohomology, and operator K-theory.\nWe gather together many of these approaches and apply them in the standard case\ninvolving the time components of the gauge currents. We then proceed to extend\nthe analysis to the general case with all space-time components.

Recent research found\nthat countries with universal Bacillus Calmette-Gu\\'erin (BCG) childhood\nvaccination policies tend to be less affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nHowever, such ecological studies are biased by numerous confounders. Instead,\nthis paper takes advantage of a rare nationwide natural experiment that took\nplace in Sweden in 1975, where discontinuation of newborns BCG vaccination led\nto a dramatic fall of the BCG coverage rate from 92% to 2% , thus allowing us\nto estimate the BCG's effect without all the biases associated with\ncross-country comparisons. Numbers of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations were\nrecorded for birth cohorts born just before and just after that change,\nrepresenting 1,026,304 and 1,018,544 individuals, respectively. We used\nregression discontinuity to assess the effect of BCG vaccination on Covid-19\nrelated outcomes.

A new disease brings many uncertainties, but trials\nmust start rapidly. COVID-19 is heterogeneous, ranging from mild disease that\nimproves within days to critical disease that can last weeks and can end in\ndeath. While improvement in mortality would provide unquestionable evidence\nabout clinical significance of a treatment, sample sizes for a study evaluating\nmortality are large and may be impractical. Furthermore, patient states in\nbetween \"cure\" and \"death\" represent meaningful distinctions. Clinical severity\nscores have been proposed as an alternative. However, the appropriate summary\nmeasure for severity scores has been the subject of debate, particularly in\nrelating to the uncertainty about the time-course of COVID-19. Outcomes\nmeasured at fixed time-points may risk missing the time of clinical benefit. An\nendpoint such as time-to-improvement (or recovery), avoids the timing problem.\nHowever, some have argued that power losses will result from reducing the\nordinal scale to a binary state of \"recovered\" vs \"not recovered.\"\n  Methods: We evaluate statistical power for possible trial endpoints for\nCOVID-19 treatment trials using simulation models and data from two recent\nCOVID-19 treatment trials.\n  Results: Power for fixed-time point methods depends heavily on the time\nselected for evaluation. Time-to-improvement (or recovery) analyses do not\nspecify a time-point. Time-to-event approaches have reasonable statistical\npower, even when compared to a fixed time-point method evaluated at the optimal\ntime.\n  Discussion: Time-to-event analyses methods have advantages in the COVID-19\nsetting, unless the optimal time for evaluating treatment effect is known in\nadvance. Even when the optimal time is known, a time-to-event approach may\nincrease power for interim analyses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2020 10:34:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-19"}

In some practical situations, each identity has only a single sample\navailable for training. Face recognition under this situation is referred to as\nsingle sample face recognition and poses significant challenges to the\neffective training of deep models. Therefore, in recent years, researchers have\nattempted to unleash more potential of deep learning and improve the model\nrecognition performance in the single sample situation. While several\ncomprehensive surveys have been conducted on traditional single sample face\nrecognition approaches, emerging deep learning based methods are rarely\ninvolved in these reviews. Accordingly, we focus on the deep learning-based\nmethods in this paper, classifying them into virtual sample methods and generic\nlearning methods. In the former category, virtual images or virtual features\nare generated to benefit the training of the deep model. In the latter one,\nadditional multi-sample generic sets are used. There are three types of generic\nlearning methods: combining traditional methods and deep features, improving\nthe loss function, and improving network structure, all of which are covered in\nour analysis. Moreover, we review face datasets that have been commonly used\nfor evaluating single sample face recognition models and go on to compare the\nresults of different types of models. Additionally, we discuss problems with\nexisting single sample face recognition methods, including identity information\npreservation in virtual sample methods, domain adaption in generic learning\nmethods. Furthermore, we regard developing unsupervised methods is a promising\nfuture direction, and point out that the semantic gap as an important issue\nthat needs to be further considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2020 13:24:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Aug 2022 05:52:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-11"}
