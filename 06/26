First, we consider the\nabsorption of light bosons, either as dark matter relics or being produced\ndirectly in the Sun. In the latter case, we find that keV mass bosons produced\nin the Sun provide an adequate fit to the data but are excluded by stellar\ncooling constraints. We address this tension by introducing a novel\nChameleon-like axion model, which can explain the excess while evading the\nstellar bounds. We find that absorption of bosonic dark matter provides a\nviable explanation for the excess only if the dark matter is a dark photon or\nan axion. In the latter case, photophobic axion couplings are necessary to\navoid X-ray constraints. Second, we analyze models of dark matter-electron\nscattering to determine which models might explain the excess. Standard\nscattering of dark matter with electrons is generically in conflict with data\nfrom lower-threshold experiments. Momentum-dependent interactions with a heavy\nmediator can fit the data with dark matter mass heavier than a GeV but are\ngenerically in tension with collider constraints. Next, we consider dark matter\nconsisting of two (or more) states that have a small mass splitting. The\nexothermic (down)scattering of the heavier state to the lighter state can fit\nthe data for keV mass splittings.

This entails\nspreading out the use of high-powered appliances such as dishwashers and\nwashing machines throughout the day. Traditional approaches to this problem\nhave relied on differential pricing set by a centralised utility company. But\nthis mechanism has not been effective in promoting widespread shifting of\nappliance usage. Here we consider an alternative decentralised mechanism, where\nagents receive an initial allocation of time-slots to use their appliances and\ncan then exchange these with other agents. If agents are willing to be more\nflexible in the exchanges they accept, then overall satisfaction, in terms of\nthe percentage of agents time-slot preferences that are satisfied, will\nincrease. This requires a mechanism that can incentivise agents to be more\nflexible. Building on previous work, we show that a mechanism incorporating\nsocial capital - the tracking of favours given and received - can incentivise\nagents to act flexibly and give favours by accepting exchanges that do not\nimmediately benefit them. We demonstrate that a mechanism that tracks favours\nincreases the overall satisfaction of agents, and crucially allows social\nagents that give favours to outcompete selfish agents that do not under\npayoff-biased social learning. Thus, even completely self-interested agents are\nexpected to learn to produce socially beneficial outcomes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jun 2020 16:23:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-07"}

Specifically, we show that any positive tensor product of a qubit map\nwith itself is decomposable. This solves a recent conjecture by S. Fillipov and\nK. Magadov. We contrast this result with examples of non-decomposable positive\nmaps arising as the tensor product of two distinct qubit maps or as the tensor\nsquare of a decomposable map from a qubit to a ququart. To show our main\nresult, we reduce the problem to Pauli diagonal maps. We then characterize the\ncone of decomposable ququart Pauli diagonal maps by determining all 252\nextremal rays of ququart Pauli diagonal maps that are both completely positive\nand completely copositive.

One aspect of this\nseparation is that at large N, one can unambiguously identify a plasma regime\nthat is strongly coupled. The existence of a first-order transition suggests\nthat the hadronic phase can be superheated and the plasma phase supercooled.\nThe supercooled deconfined plasma present at large N, if it exists, has the\nremarkable property that it has negative absolute pressure -- i.e. a pressure\nbelow that of the vacuum. For energy densities of order unity in a 1/N\nexpansion but beyond the endpoint of the hadronic superheated phase, a\ndescription of homogeneous matter composed of ordinary hadrons with masses of\norder unity in a 1/N expansion can exist, and acts as though it has a\ntemperature of $T_H$ in order unity. However, the connection between the\ncanonical and microcanonical descriptions breaks down and the system cannot\nfully equilibrate as $N \\rightarrow \\infty$.

Because of\ntheir ability to flexibly adjust power generation in real time, gas-fired power\nplants are frequently seen as the perfect partner for variable renewable\ngeneration. However, this reliance on gas generation increases interdependence\nand propagates uncertainty between power grids and gas pipelines, and brings\ncoordination and uncertainty management challenges. To address these issues, we\npropose an uncertainty management framework for uncertain, but bounded gas\nconsumption by gas-fired power plants. The admissible ranges are computed based\non a joint optimization problem for the combined gas and electricity networks,\nwhich involves chance-constrained scheduling for the electric grid and a novel\nrobust optimization formulation for the natural gas network.

Current studies mainly treat anti-spoofing as a binary\nclassification problem between bonafide and spoofed utterances, while lack of\nindistinguishable samples makes it difficult to train a robust spoofing\ndetector. In this paper, we argue that for anti-spoofing, it needs more\nattention for indistinguishable samples over easily-classified ones in the\nmodeling process, to make correct discrimination a top priority. Therefore, to\nmitigate the data discrepancy between training and inference, we propose D3M,\nto leverage a balanced focal loss function as the training objective to\ndynamically scale the loss based on the traits of the sample itself. Besides,\nin the experiments, we select three kinds of features that contain both\nmagnitude-based and phase-based information to form complementary and\ninformative features. Experimental results on the ASVspoof2019 dataset\ndemonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods by comparison between our\nsystems and top-performing ones. Systems trained with the balanced focal loss\nperform significantly better than conventional cross-entropy loss. With\ncomplementary features, our fusion system with only three kinds of features\noutperforms other systems containing five or more complex single models by\n22.5% for min-tDCF and 7% for EER, achieving a min-tDCF and an EER of 0.0124\nand 0.55% respectively.

Here we\nconstruct a formal theory of network energetics to account for how changes in\nbrain state produce changes in sequential behavior. We exercise the theory in\nthe context of multi-unit recordings spanning the caudate nucleus, prefrontal\ncortex, and frontal eyefields of female macaque monkeys engaged in 60-180\nsessions of a free scan task that induces motor habits. The theory relies on\nthe determination of effective connectivity between recording channels, and on\nthe stipulation that a brain state is taken to be the trial-specific firing\nrate across those channels. The theory then predicts how much energy will be\nrequired to transition from one state into another, given the constraint that\nactivity can spread solely through effective connections. Consistent with the\ntheory's predictions, we observed smaller energy requirements for transitions\nbetween more similar and more complex trial saccade patterns, and for sessions\ncharacterized by less entropic selection of saccade patterns. Using a virtual\nlesioning approach, we demonstrate the resilience of the observed relationships\nbetween minimum control energy and behavior to significant disruptions in the\ninferred effective connectivity.

For the current time step, the small view branch is\nused to learn the core semantics, while the big view branch is used to capture\nthe contextual semantics. Unlike traditional temporal convolution, the big view\nbranch can provide the small view branch with the most activated video features\nfrom a broader 3D receptive field.

Recently, submodular functions are becoming\nincreasingly important in machine learning (ML) for modelling notions such as\ninformation and redundancy among entities such as data and features. Among\nthese applications, a key question is payoff allocation, i.e., how to evaluate\nthe importance of each entity towards the collective objective? To this end,\nclassic solution concepts from cooperative game theory offer principled\napproaches to payoff allocation. However, despite the extensive body of\ngame-theoretic literature, payoff allocation in submodular games are relatively\nunder-researched. In particular, an important notion that arises in the\nemerging submodular applications is redundancy, which may occur from various\nsources such as abundant data or malicious manipulations where a player\nreplicates its resource and act under multiple identities. Though many\ngame-theoretic solution concepts can be directly used in submodular games,\nnaively applying them for payoff allocation in these settings may incur\nrobustness issues against replication. In this paper, we systematically study\nthe replication manipulation in submodular games and investigate replication\nrobustness, a metric that quantitatively measures the robustness of solution\nconcepts against replication. Using this metric, we present conditions which\ntheoretically characterise the robustness of semivalues, a wide family of\nsolution concepts including the Shapley and Banzhaf value.

A natural yet unexplored question is whether the topology of the\nunderlying structures on which the games are played, possesses no role\nwhatsoever in the determination of payoffs. Herein, we introduce the notion of\ncooperator graphs and defector graphs as well as a new form of game payoff,\nwhich is weakly dependent on the underlying network topology. These concepts\nare inspired by the well-known microbial phenomenon of quorum sensing.

However, there remain a few UDGs that seem to be\nspecial in terms of their globular cluster (GC) systems. In particular,\naccording to some authors, certain UDGs exhibit large GC populations when\ncompared to expectations from their stellar (or total) mass. Among these\nspecial UDGs, DF44 in the Coma cluster is one of the better-known examples.\nDF44 has been claimed to have a relatively high number of GCs,\n$N_{GC}=74^{+18}_{-18}$, for a stellar mass of only $3\\times 10^8$ $M_{ \\odot\n}$ which would indicate a much larger dark halo mass than dwarfs of similar\nstellar mass. In this paper we revisit this number and, contrary to previous\nresults, find $N_{GC}=21^{+7}_{-9}$ assuming that the distribution of the GCs\nfollows the same geometry as the galaxy. If we assume that the GCs around DF44\nare distributed in a (projected) circularly symmetric way and, if we use a less\nstrict criterion for the selection of the GCs, we find $N_{GC}=18^{+23}_{-12}$.\nMaking use of the $M_{\\rm GC} - M_{\\rm halo}$ relation, this number of GCs\nsuggests a dark matter halo mass of $M_{halo}=1.1^{+0.4}_{-0.5} \\times 10^{11}\nM_{\\odot}$, a value which is consistent with the expected total mass for DF44\nbased on its velocity dispersion, $\\sigma=33^{+3}_{-3}$ km s$^{-1}$.

Aims: We want to provide a new temperature scale for\nclassical Cepheids, with a high precision and full control of the systematics.\nMethods: Using a data-driven machine learning technique employing observed\nspectra, and taking great care to accurately phase single-epoch observations,\nwe have tied flux ratios to (label) temperatures derived using the infrared\nsurface brightness method. Results: We identified 143 flux ratios that allow us\nto determine the effective temperature with a precision of a few K and an\naccuracy better than 150 K, which is in line with the most accurate temperature\nmeasures available to date. The method does not require a normalization of the\ninput spectra and provides homogeneous temperatures for low- and\nhigh-resolution spectra, even at the lowest signal-to-noise ratios.

We find\nsubstantial agreement between the spectroscopic and photometric properties of\nKIC targets added by Huber et al (2014) based on 2MASS photometry. For the\nunevolved lower main sequence, we see the same concentration toward rapid\nrotation in photometric binaries as that observed in rotation period data, but\nat an enhanced rate. We attribute this difference to unresolved near-equal\nluminosity spectroscopic binaries with velocity displacements on the order of\nthe APOGEE resolution. Among cool unevolved stars we find an excess rapid\nrotator fraction of 4% caused by pipeline issues with photometric binaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jun 2020 18:04:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-05"}

For linear\nmodels, influence functions are well-defined due to the convexity of the\nunderlying loss function and are generally accurate even across difficult\nsettings where model changes are fairly large such as estimating group\ninfluences. Influence functions, however, are not well-understood in the\ncontext of deep learning with non-convex loss functions.

The ultraviolet wavelength\nrange contains a variety of strong molecular and atomic features, potentially\nenabling gas species detection even when atmospheric hazes are present. To\nunderstand the interplay between aerosol extinction and ultraviolet molecular\nopacities, we investigate transmission through the atmosphere of Saturn's moon\nTitan during an occultation observed with the Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer\n(UVIS) aboard NASA's Cassini orbiter.

Interestingly, there is no\nreliable measure to quantify anharmonicity so far. Thus, a systematic\nclassification of materials in terms of anharmonicity and a benchmark of\nmethodologies that may be appropriate for different strengths of anharmonicity\nis currently impossible. In this work, we derive and discuss a statistical\nmeasure that reliably classifies compounds across temperature regimes and\nmaterial classes by their \"degree of anharmonicity\". This enables us to\ndistinguish \"harmonic\" materials, for which anharmonic effects constitute a\nsmall perturbation on top of the harmonic approximation, from strongly\n\"anharmonic\" materials, for which anharmonic effects become significant or even\ndominant and the treatment of anharmonicity in terms of perturbation theory is\nmore than questionable. We show that the analysis of this measure in real and\nreciprocal space is able to shed light on the underlying microscopic\nmechanisms, even at conditions close to, e.g., phase transitions or defect\nformation. Eventually, we demonstrate that the developed approach is\ncomputationally efficient and enables rapid high-throughput searches by\nscanning over a set of several hundred binary solids.

The specific form of the driving\nforce is shown to break spatial parity and time-reversal symmetries, which\nleads to such an asymptotic population imbalance (API). The value of the API\ncan be flexibly controlled by changing the phase of the driving force and the\ntotal number of particles. While the API is highly sensitive to the initial\nstate in the few-particle regime, this dependence on the initial state is lost\nas we approach the classical limit of large particle numbers. We perform a\nFloquet analysis in the few-particle regime and an analysis based on a driven\nclassical non-rigid pendulum in the many-particle regime. Although the obtained\nAPI values in the many-particle regime agree very well with that obtained in\nthe classical limit, we show that there exists a significant disagreement in\nthe corresponding real-time population imbalance due to quantum correlations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jun 2020 20:01:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-09"}

If DM particles are heavy, the\nannihilation productions of DM can be highly boosted, thus the fluxes of\nanti-nuclei produced by DM annihilations may exceed the secondary background at\nhigh energies, which opens a high energy window for DM indirect detections. We\ninvestigate the possibility of detecting heavy DM particles which annihilate\ninto high energy anti-nuclei.

The\nbalancing of these terms requires considerable human effort and is\ncomputationally demanding. Moreover, the optimal trade-off between the loss\nterm can change as training progresses, especially for adversarial terms. In\nthis work, we generalize the Adam optimization algorithm to handle multiple\nloss terms. The guiding principle is that for every layer, the gradient\nmagnitude of the terms should be balanced. To this end, the Multi-Term Adam\n(MTAdam) computes the derivative of each loss term separately, infers the first\nand second moments per parameter and loss term, and calculates a first moment\nfor the magnitude per layer of the gradients arising from each loss. This\nmagnitude is used to continuously balance the gradients across all layers, in a\nmanner that both varies from one layer to the next and dynamically changes over\ntime. Our results show that training with the new method leads to fast recovery\nfrom suboptimal initial loss weighting and to training outcomes that match\nconventional training with the prescribed hyperparameters of each method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jun 2020 20:27:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-29"}

Superflares (stellar flares\nwhose energy exceeds 10^33 erg) can completely destroy the atmospheres of a\ncool star's planets, allowing ultraviolet radiation and high-energy particles\nto bombard their surfaces. However, ultracool dwarfs emit little ultraviolet\nflux when quiescent, raising the possibility of frequent flares being necessary\nfor prebiotic chemistry that requires ultraviolet light. We combine Evryscope\nand Kepler observations to characterize the high-energy flare rate of\nTRAPPIST-1. The Evryscope is an array of 22 small telescopes imaging the entire\nSouthern sky in g' every two minutes. Evryscope observations, spanning 170\nnights over 2 years, complement the 80-day continuous short-cadence K2\nobservations by sampling TRAPPIST-1's long-term flare activity. We update\nTRAPPIST-1's superflare rate, finding a cumulative rate of 4.2 (+1.9 -0.2)\nsuperflares per year. We calculate the flare rate necessary to deplete ozone in\nthe habitable-zone planets' atmospheres, and find that TRAPPIST-1's flare rate\nis insufficient to deplete ozone if present on its planets. In addition, we\ncalculate the flare rate needed to provide enough ultraviolet flux to power\nprebiotic chemistry. We find TRAPPIST-1's flare rate is likely insufficient to\ncatalyze some of the Earthlike chemical pathways thought to lead to RNA\nsynthesis, and flux due to flares in the biologically relevant UV-B band is\norders of magnitude less for any TRAPPIST-1 planet than has been experienced by\nEarth at any time in its history.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jun 2020 21:31:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Aug 2020 18:58:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-02"}

Fine-tuning pre-trained convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs) has been shown to work well for skin lesion classification. Pre-trained\nCNNs are usually trained with natural images of a fixed image size which is\ntypically significantly smaller than captured skin lesion images and\nconsequently dermoscopic images are downsampled for fine-tuning. However,\nuseful medical information may be lost during this transformation. In this\npaper, we explore the effect of input image size on skin lesion classification\nperformance of fine-tuned CNNs. For this, we resize dermoscopic images to\ndifferent resolutions, ranging from 64x64 to 768x768 pixels and investigate the\nresulting classification performance of three well-established CNNs, namely\nDenseNet-121, ResNet-18, and ResNet-50.

However, both images\nare media specific and useful for object identification.\n  Nonlocal effects of the attenuation image on the data are summarized by the\nbroken ray transform (BRT). While analytic inversion formulas exist, poor\nconditioning of the inverse problem is only exacerbated by noisy measurements\nand sampling errors. This has motivated interest in the related star transforms\nincorporating BRT measurements from multiple source-detector pairs. However,\nall analytic methods operate on the log of the data.

When a Van Hove point is\nclose to the Fermi level, tendencies towards density wave orders, Pomeranchuk\norders, and superconductivity can all be enhanced, often in more than one\nchannel, leading to a competition between different orders and unconventional\nground states. Here we consider the effects from higher-order Van Hove points,\naround which the dispersion is flatter than near a conventional Van Hove point,\nand the density of states has a power-law divergence. We argue that such points\nare present in intercalated graphene and other materials. We use an effective\nlow-energy model for electrons near higher-order Van Hove points and analyze\nthe competition between different ordering tendencies using an unbiased\nrenormalization group approach. For purely repulsive interactions, we find that\ntwo key competitors are ferromagnetism and chiral superconductivity. For a\nsmall attractive exchange interaction, we find a new type of spin Pomeranchuk\norder, in which the spin order parameter winds around the Fermi surface. The\nsupermetal state, predicted for a single higher-order Van Hove point, is an\nunstable fixed point in our case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jun 2020 23:12:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-30"}

One reason for this is the lack\nof a complete and updated database containing the electronic addresses (web\ndomain names) of the municipal governments having a website. Due to diverse\ncauses, not all the Mexican municipalities have one, and a number of those\nhaving it do not present information corresponding to the current governments\nbut, instead, to other previous ones. The scarce official lists of municipal\nwebsites are not updated with the sufficient frequency, and manually\ndetermining which municipalities have an operating and valid website in a given\nmoment is a time-consuming process. Besides, website contents do not always\ncomply with legal requirements and are considerably heterogeneous. In turn, the\nevolution development level of municipal websites is valuable information that\ncan be harnessed for diverse theoretical and practical purposes in the public\nadministration field. Obtaining all these pieces of information requires\nwebsite content analysis. Therefore, this article investigates the need for and\nthe feasibility to automate implementation and updating of a digital repository\nto perform diverse analyses of these websites. Its technological feasibility is\naddressed by means of a literature review about web scraping and by proposing a\npreliminary manual methodology.

A provable defense provides a certificate\nfor each test sample, which is a lower bound on the magnitude of any\nadversarial distortion of the training set that can corrupt the test sample's\nclassification. We propose two novel provable defenses against poisoning\nattacks: (i) Deep Partition Aggregation (DPA), a certified defense against a\ngeneral poisoning threat model, defined as the insertion or deletion of a\nbounded number of samples to the training set -- by implication, this threat\nmodel also includes arbitrary distortions to a bounded number of images and/or\nlabels; and (ii) Semi-Supervised DPA (SS-DPA), a certified defense against\nlabel-flipping poisoning attacks.

Our defense against label-flipping\nattacks, SS-DPA, uses a semi-supervised learning algorithm as its base\nclassifier model: each base classifier is trained using the entire unlabeled\ntraining set in addition to the labels for a partition. SS-DPA significantly\noutperforms the existing certified defense for label-flipping attacks on both\nMNIST and CIFAR-10: provably tolerating, for at least half of test images, over\n600 label flips (vs. < 200 label flips) on MNIST and over 300 label flips (vs.\n175 label flips) on CIFAR-10.

We propose a\ndetailed biological mechanism for the widely-embraced idea that learning is\nbased on the differences between predictions and actual outcomes (i.e.,\npredictive error-driven learning). Specifically, numerous weak projections into\nthe pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus generate top-down predictions, and sparse,\nfocal driver inputs from lower areas supply the actual outcome, originating in\nlayer 5 intrinsic bursting (5IB) neurons. Thus, the outcome is only briefly\nactivated, roughly every 100 msec (i.e., 10 Hz, alpha), resulting in a temporal\ndifference error signal, which drives local synaptic changes throughout the\nneocortex, resulting in a biologically-plausible form of error backpropagation\nlearning.

In this article, we\npresent the co-design framework, namely QuantumFlow, to provide such a missing\nlink. QuantumFlow consists of novel quantum-friendly neural networks (QF-Nets),\na mapping tool (QF-Map) to generate the quantum circuit (QF-Circ) for QF-Nets,\nand an execution engine (QF-FB). We discover that, in order to make full use of\nthe strength of quantum representation, it is best to represent data in a\nneural network as either random variables or numbers in unitary matrices, such\nthat they can be directly operated by the basic quantum logical gates. Based on\nthese data representations, we propose two quantum friendly neural networks,\nQF-pNet and QF-hNet in QuantumFlow. QF-pNet using random variables has better\nflexibility, and can seamlessly connect two layers without measurement with\nmore qbits and logical gates than QF-hNet.

Compared to the cost of O(2^k)in\nclassical computing, QF-hNet demonstrates the quantum advantages.

To formally\nunderstand the unfamiliar concept of binary set classification, we first\ninvestigate the optimal decision rule under the normal distribution, which\nutilizes the empirical covariance of the set to be classified. We show that the\nnumber of observations in the set plays a critical role in bounding the Bayes\nrisk. Under this framework, we further propose new methods of set\nclassification. For the case where only a few parameters of the model drive the\ndifference between two classes, we propose a computationally-efficient approach\nto parameter estimation using linear programming, leading to the\nCovariance-engaged LInear Programming Set (CLIPS) classifier. Its theoretical\nproperties are investigated for both independent case and various (short-range\nand long-range dependent) time series structures among observations within each\nset.

Certain misclassifications (eg.\nclassifying the image of a dog to an airplane) can perplex humans and result in\nthe loss of human trust in the system. Even worse, these errors (eg. a person\nmisclassified as a primate) can have odious societal impacts. Thus, in this\nwork, we aim to reduce inexplicable errors. To address this challenge, we first\ndiscuss methods to obtain the class-level semantics that capture the human's\nexpectation ($M^h$) regarding which classes are semantically close {\\em vs.}\nones that are far away. We show that for popular image benchmarks (like\nCIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet), class-level semantics can be readily obtained\nby leveraging either human subject studies or publicly available human-curated\nknowledge bases.

Within the context of linear\nelasticity theory, the apparent elasticity tensor field at a given mesoscale is\nmodeled by a prior non-Gaussian tensor-valued random field.

Its design consists of a\nmonolithic large PbWO4 scintillating crystal with an efficient photocathode\ndirectly deposited on it. With an index of refraction higher for the\nphotocathode than for the crystal, this design negates the total reflection\neffect of optical photons at the crystal/photo-detector optical interface, and\nthus largely improves optical coupling between the crystal and the\nphotodetector. This allows to detect efficiently the Cherenkov light produced\nby 511 keV photoelectric conversions in PbWO4, and to optimize the detector\ntime resolution. Furthermore, the low-yield, fast scintillation light produced\nadditionally by PbWO4 increases the detected photon statistics by a factor 10,\nthus fostering accurate (3 dimensional) localization of the gamma ray\ninteraction within the crystal and providing a fair measurement of the\ndeposited energy.

On the other, deep learning has also been\nfound vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which calls for new techniques to\ndefend deep models against these attacks. Among the attack algorithms, the\nblack-box schemes are of serious practical concern since they only need\npublicly available knowledge of the targeted model. We carefully analyze the\ninherent weakness of deep models in black-box settings where the attacker may\ndevelop the attack using a model similar to the targeted model.

Subsequently, certain hyperparameters of the\nchosen models for each sample size are optimized with Bayesian and Bandit\noptimization. The hyperparameter tuning is performed with a self-made\nKubernetes cluster. The models outputs were investigated with respect to the\ninput data by the utilization of layer-wise relevance propagation. With\noptimized models we created an ensemble model to improve the segmentation\nperformance. Finally, an area around the airport of Arnsberg in North\nRhine-Westphalia was segmented and emergency landing fields are identified,\nwhile the verification of the final approach's obstacle clearance is left\nunconsidered. These emergency landing fields are stored in a PostgreSQL\ndatabase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jun 2020 09:40:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 09:35:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-01"}

In NGC4469,\nthis structure has a boxy shape, inclined by $\\Delta$PA$\\approx$3$^{\\circ}$\nwith respect to the inner disc, whereas NGC4452 harbours a discy outer\nstructure with $\\Delta$PA$\\approx$6$^{\\circ}$.

The\nunderlying distribution of streaming data changes unexpectedly, resulting in\ndifferent graph structures (a.k.a., concept drift).

While for a two-planet system a sharp stability boundary exists,\nnumerical simulations of three and more planet systems show that they can\nexperience instability on timescales up to billions of years. Moreover, an\nexponential trend between the planet orbital separation measured in units of\nHill radii and the survival time has been reported. While these findings have\nbeen observed in numerous numerical simulations, little is known of the actual\nmechanism leading to instability. Contrary to a constant diffusion process,\nplanetary systems seem to remain dynamically quiescent for most of their\nlifetime before a very short unstable phase. In this work, we show how the slow\nchaotic diffusion due to the overlap of three-body resonances dominates the\ntimescale leading to the instability for initially coplanar and circular\norbits. While the last instability phase is related to scattering due to\ntwo-planet mean motion resonances (MMR), for circular orbits the two-planets\nMMR are too far separated to destabilize systems initially away from them. We\ndevelop an analytical model to generalize the empirical trend obtained for\nequal mass and equally-spaced planets to general systems. We obtain an\nanalytical estimate of the survival time consistent with simulations over four\norders of magnitude for the planet to star mass ratio $\\epsilon$, and 6 to 8\norders of magnitude for the instability time. We also confirm that measuring\nthe orbital spacing in terms of Hill radii is not adapted and that the right\nspacing unit scales as $\\epsilon^{1/4}$. We predict that beyond a certain\nspacing, the three-planet resonances are not overlapped, which results in an\nincrease of the survival time.

In order\nto ameliorate some of these challenges, we investigate a layerwise learning\nstrategy for parametrized quantum circuits. The circuit depth is incrementally\ngrown during optimization, and only subsets of parameters are updated in each\ntraining step. We show that when considering sampling noise, this strategy can\nhelp avoid the problem of barren plateaus of the error surface due to the low\ndepth of circuits, low number of parameters trained in one step, and larger\nmagnitude of gradients compared to training the full circuit. These properties\nmake our algorithm preferable for execution on noisy intermediate-scale quantum\ndevices. We demonstrate our approach on an image-classification task on\nhandwritten digits, and show that layerwise learning attains an 8% lower\ngeneralization error on average in comparison to standard learning schemes for\ntraining quantum circuits of the same size. Additionally, the percentage of\nruns that reach lower test errors is up to 40% larger compared to training the\nfull circuit, which is susceptible to creeping onto a plateau during training.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jun 2020 10:44:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-10"}

For Hb in cubic water boxes with 90 Aengstroem and 120\nAengstroem edge length it is observed that following a decrease in LH as a\nconsequence of reduced water density or change of water orientation at the\nprotein/water interface the alpha / beta interfaces are destabilized; this is a\nhallmark of the Perutz stereochemical model for the T to R transition in Hb.\nThe present work thus provides a dynamical view of the classical structural\nmodel relevant to the molecular foundations of Hb function.

This model, which can be seen as an extension of the\nwell-known singlet scalar model, features two complex scalar fields--the dark\nmatter particles--that are Standard Model singlets but have different charges\nunder a $Z_5$ symmetry. The interactions allowed by the $Z_5$ give rise to\nnovel processes between the dark matter particles that affect their relic\ndensities and their detection prospects, which we study in detail. The key\nparameters of the model are identified and its viable regions are characterized\nby means of random scans.

This problem can be formulated as a\npenalized maximum likelihood estimation of the precision matrix under Laplacian\nstructural constraints. Like in the classical graphical lasso problem, recent\nworks made use of the $\\ell_1$-norm regularization with the goal of promoting\nsparsity in Laplacian structural precision matrix estimation. However, we find\nthat the widely used $\\ell_1$-norm is not effective in imposing a sparse\nsolution in this problem. Through empirical evidence, we observe that the\nnumber of nonzero graph weights grows with the increase of the regularization\nparameter. From a theoretical perspective, we prove that a large regularization\nparameter will surprisingly lead to a fully connected graph. To address this\nissue, we propose a nonconvex estimation method by solving a sequence of\nweighted $\\ell_1$-norm penalized sub-problems and prove that the statistical\nerror of the proposed estimator matches the minimax lower bound. To solve each\nsub-problem, we develop a projected gradient descent algorithm that enjoys a\nlinear convergence rate.

We identify\ncurrent sheets as regions where s = J d/B is above some predefined threshold\n(where B is the field strength, J the current density and d the grid scale),\nand assume that the particle injection efficiency scales as proportional to the\nsquare of the current. X-ray emitting particles have short cooling times, so\nthey only probe the field geometry of their injection sites. In contrast,\nparticles emitting in the optical band, which we follow self-consistently as\nthey propagate away from their injection sites while cooling, sample a larger\nvolume, and so they may be expected to produce different polarimetric\nsignatures. We find that the degree of polarization is roughly the same between\nX-ray and optical bands, because even the optical-emitting particles do not\ntravel far from the current sheet where they were injected, due to lack of\nsufficient kink-generated turbulence.

We verified that the disk-bearing stars in our\nsample are significantly more variable in the near-infrared than diskless\nstars, with a steep increase in the disk-fraction among stars with higher\nvariability amplitude. We investigated the trajectories described by variable\nstars in the color-space and measured slopes for 335 stars describing linear\ntrajectories. Based on the trajectories in the color-space, we inferred that\nthe sample analyzed is composed of a mix of young stars presenting variability\ndue to hot and cold spots, extinction by circumstellar material, and changes in\nthe disk emission in the near-infrared. We contemplated using the use of\nnear-infrared variability to identify disk-bearing stars and verified that\n53.4$\\%$ of the known disk-bearing stars in our sample could have been\nidentified as such based solely on their variability. We present 18 newly\nidentified disk-bearing stars and 14 eclipsing binary candidates among CygOB2\nlower-mass members.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jun 2020 14:02:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-02"}

This is\nbecause these require the simulation of light to be photorealistic, which in\nturn requires physically accurate modelling of geometry, materials, and light\nsources, for both the head and the surrounding scene. Non-photorealistic\nrenders however are increasingly easy to produce. In contrast to computer\ngraphics approaches, generative models learned from more readily available 2D\nimage data have been shown to produce samples of human faces that are hard to\ndistinguish from real data. The process of learning usually corresponds to a\nloss of control over the shape and appearance of the generated images. For\ninstance, even simple disentangling tasks such as modifying the hair\nindependently of the face, which is trivial to accomplish in a computer\ngraphics approach, remains an open research question.

We consider here the classic regression setup, where a real\nvalued square integrable r.v. $Y$ is to be predicted upon observing a (possibly\nhigh dimensional) random vector $X$ by means of a predictive function $f(X)$ as\naccurately as possible in the mean-squared sense and study a\nnearest-neighbour-based pointwise estimate of the gradient of the optimal\npredictive function, the regression function $m(x)=\\mathbb{E}[Y\\mid X=x]$.\nUnder classic smoothness conditions combined with the assumption that the tails\nof $Y-m(X)$ are sub-Gaussian, we prove nonasymptotic bounds improving upon\nthose obtained for alternative estimation methods. Beyond the novel theoretical\nresults established, several illustrative numerical experiments have been\ncarried out. The latter provide strong empirical evidence that the estimation\nmethod proposed works very well for various statistical problems involving\ngradient estimation, namely dimensionality reduction, stochastic gradient\ndescent optimization and quantifying disentanglement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jun 2020 15:19:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-29"}

A possible way of estimating the size of these states is to\nstudy their behavior when immersed in QCD matter. Recently, LHCb has measured\nthe relative abundance of the exotic $X(3872)$ over the ordinary $\\psi(2S)$. We\nuse the comover interaction model to study the yield of a compact $X(3872)$. To\nconfirm the reliability of the model in high-multiplicity $pp$ collisions, we\ndescribe the suppression of excited over ground $\\Upsilon$ states. With this at\nhand, we show that the size of the compact $X(3872)$ would be slightly larger\nthan that of the $\\psi(2S)$. If the $X(3872)$ is instead assumed to be a meson\nmolecule of large size, we argue that its evolution in QCD matter should be\ndescribed via a coalescence model, as suggested by data on deuteron production.\nWe show that the predictions of this model for the $X(3872)$ are in contrast\nwith data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jun 2020 15:21:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 8 Jul 2021 13:08:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-02"}

VAMANA uses a mixture of weighted Gaussians to reconstruct the chirp mass\ndistribution. We expect Gaussian mixtures to provide flexibility in modeling\ncomplex distributions and enable us in capturing details in the astrophysical\nchirp mass distribution. Each of the Gaussian in the mixture is combined with\nanother Gaussian and a power-law to simultaneously model the spin component\naligned with the orbital angular momentum and the mass ratio distribution, thus\nalso allowing us to capture their variation with the chirp mass. Additionally,\nwe can also introduce broadband smoothing by restricting the Gaussian mixture\nto lie within a threshold distance of a predefined reference chirp mass\ndistribution.

An\nemerging class of peculiar thermonuclear SNe, called Type Iax, show photometric\nand spectroscopic behaviors distinct from normal Type Ia. Their origin remains\nhighly controversial, but pure turbulent deflagration of white dwarfs (WDs) has\nbeen regarded as the leading formation theory. The large population of Type Iax\nindicates the existence of unidentified Galactic Type Iax supernova remnants\n(SNRs). We report evidence that SNR Sgr A East in the Galactic center resulted\nfrom a pure turbulent deflagration of a Chandrasekhar-mass carbon-oxygen WD, an\nexplosion mechanism used for Type Iax SNe. Our X-ray spectroscopic study of Sgr\nA East using 3 Ms of Chandra data shows a low ratio of intermediate-mass\nelements to Fe and large Mn/Fe and Ni/Fe ratios. This abundance pattern does\nnot accord with the core-collapse or normal Type Ia models. Sgr A East is thus\nthe first Galactic SNR for which a likely Type Iax origin has been proposed and\nthe nearest target for studying this peculiar class. We compared Sgr A East\nwith the Fe-rich SNRs 3C 397 and W49B, which also have high Mn and Cr\nabundances and were claimed to result from deflagration-to-detonation\nexplosions of Chandrasekhar-mass WDs (although with disputes). Our study shows\nthat they have distinct abundance patterns. The X-ray spectroscopic studies of\nthermonuclear SNRs provide observational evidence for the theories that there\nare diverse explosion channels and various metal outputs for Chandrasekhar-mass\nWDs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jun 2020 15:26:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2020 15:03:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-17"}

Optomechanical systems can be arranged to\ngenerate quantum entanglement between the mechanics and a mode of travelling\nlight. Here we propose automated optimisation of the production of quantum\ncorrelations in such a system, beyond what can be achieved through analytical\nmethods, by applying Bayesian optimisation to the control parameters. Two-mode\noptomechanical squeezing experiment is simulated using a detailed theoretical\nmodel of the system, while the Bayesian optimisation process modifies the\ncontrollable parameters in order to maximise the non-classical two-mode\nsqueezing and its detection, independently of the inner workings of the model.\nThe Bayesian optimisation treats the simulations or the experiments as a black\nbox. This we refer to as \\emph{theory-blind} optimisation, and the optimisation\nprocess is designed to be unaware of whether it is working with a simulation or\nthe actual experimental setup. We find that in the experimentally relevant\nthermal regimes, the ability to vary and optimise a broad array of control\nparameters provides access to large values of two-mode squeezing that would\notherwise be difficult or intractable to discover. In particular we observe\nthat modulation of the driving frequency around the resonant sideband, when\nadded to the set of control parameters, produces strong nonclassical\ncorrelations greater on average than the maximum achieved by optimising over\nthe remaining parameters. We also find that using our optimisation approach\nraises the upper limit to the thermal regime in which squeezing can be\nachieved. This extends the range of experimental setups in which non-classical\ncorrelations could be generated beyond the region of high quantum\ncooperativity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jun 2020 15:27:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Oct 2020 17:21:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-05"}

One major focus while helping introductory physics students learn effective\nproblem solving is to help them understand that drawing diagrams can facilitate\nproblem solution. We conducted an investigation in which two different\ninterventions were implemented during recitation quizzes in a large enrollment\nalgebra-based introductory physics course. Students were either (i) asked to\nsolve problems in which the diagrams were drawn for them or (ii) explicitly\ntold to draw a diagram. A comparison group was not given any instruction\nregarding diagrams. We developed rubrics to score the problem solving\nperformance of students in different intervention groups and investigated ten\nproblems. We found that students who were provided diagrams never performed\nbetter and actually performed worse than the other students on three problems,\none involving standing sound waves in a tube (discussed elsewhere) and two\nproblems in electricity which we focus on here. These two problems were the\nonly problems in electricity that involved considerations of initial and final\nconditions, which may partly account for why students provided with diagrams\nperformed significantly worse than students who were not provided with\ndiagrams. In order to explore potential reasons for this finding, we conducted\ninterviews with students and found that some students provided with diagrams\nmay have spent less time on the conceptual analysis and planning stage of the\nproblem solving process. In particular, those provided with the diagram were\nmore likely to jump into the implementation stage of problem solving early\nwithout fully analyzing and understanding the problem, which can increase the\nlikelihood of mistakes in solutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jun 2020 15:31:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-29"}

Moreover, ALMA high spatial resolution (~ 7 au)\nimages of the continuum at 1.1 mm and the HCN 3-2 line resolve different gas\ncomponents towards GV Tau N, a gaseous disc with R~25 au, an ionized jet, and\none (or two) molecular outflows. The asymmetric morphology of the gaseous disc\nshows that it has been eroded by the jet. All observations can be explained if\nGV Tau N is binary, and the primary component has a highly inclined individual\ndisc relative to the circumbinary disc. We discuss the origin of the water and\nthe other molecules emission according to this scenario.

We\nsampled solutions to the problem via two different quantum-ready methods to\nunderstand the pros and cons of each method. First we formulated and sampled\nthe problem as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem,\nvia the best known QUBO formulation, using a best-in-class QUBO sampler running\npurely classically. Second, we formulated the problem at a higher level, as a\nset of constraints and an objective function, and sampled it with a\nconstrained-optimization sampler (which internally samples the problem via\nQUBOs also sampled classically). We find that both approaches often deliver\nbetter partitions than the purpose-built classical graph partitioners. Further,\nwe find that the constrained-optimization approach is often able to deliver\nbetter partitions in less time than the bespoke-QUBO approach, without\nknowledge of the graph-partitioning problem.\n  Stepping back from graph partitioning itself, one key controversial question\nis whether bespoke algorithms or general tools are more likely to deliver the\npower of QCs to real-world users. These results bear on that question, though\nthey require confirmation on other problems and instances as well as\nreplacement of the low-level sampler by a QC. Still, this early evidence\nsupports the proposition that general tools will contribute significantly to a\nrange of problems, expanding the impact of QCs. This benefit is independent of\nthe low-level sampler employed, whether software or QC, so reinforces the need\nfor more work on high-level optimization.

We evaluated the accuracy of the point estimates and the accuracy of the\nuncertainty estimates of the model predictions. First, we compared the \"ground\ntruth\" data sources on daily deaths against which these models were trained.\nThree different data sources were used by these models, and these had\nsubstantial differences in recorded daily death counts. Two additional data\nsources that we examined also provided different death counts per day. For\naccuracy of prediction, all models fared very poorly.

Cosserat discovered a new nonlinear group\ntheoretical approach to elasticity (EL), with the only experimental need to\nmeasure the EL constants. In a modern language, their idea has been to use the\nnonlinear Spencer sequence instead of the nonlinear Janet sequence for the Lie\ngroupoid defining the group of rigid motions of space. Following H. Weyl, our\npurpose is to compute for the first time the nonlinear Spencer sequence for the\nLie groupoid defining the conformal group of space-time in order to provide the\nphysical foundations of both electromagnetism (EM) and gravitation, with the\nonly experimental need to measure the EM constant in vacuum and the\ngravitational constant. With a manifold of dimension $n$, the difficulty is to\ndeal with the $n$ nonlinear transformations that have been called \"elations\" by\nE. Cartan in 1922. Using the fact that dimension $n=4$ has very specific\nproperties for the computation of the Spencer cohomology, we prove that there\nis no conceptual difference between the Cosserat EL field or induction\nequations and the Maxwell EM field or induction equations. As a byproduct, the\nwell known field/matter couplings (piezzoelectricity, photoelasticity, ...) can\nbe described abstractly, with the only experimental need to measure the\ncorresponding coupling constants. In the sudy of gravitation, the dimension\n$n=4$ also allows to have a conformal factor defined everywhere but at the\ncentral attractive mass and the inversion law of the subgroupoid made by strict\nsecond order jets transforms attraction into repulsion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 26 Jun 2020 10:52:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-06"}
