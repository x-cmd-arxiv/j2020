A recently proposed quantum Liouvillian framework enables\nto completely determine the dynamical properties of such systems and their EPs\n(referred to as Liouvillian EPs, or LEPs) in the quantum regime by taking into\naccount the effects of quantum jumps, which are ignored in the NHH formalism.\nMoreover, the symmetry and eigenfrequency spectrum of the NHH become a part of\nmuch larger Liouvillian eigenspace.

In this\nstudy, we revisit the constraints on primordial black holes derived from\nmeasurements of the light element abundances. Black holes and their Hawking\nevaporation products can impact the era of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) by\naltering the rate of expansion at the time of neutron-proton freeze-out, as\nwell as by radiating mesons which can convert protons into neutrons and vice\nversa. Such black holes can thus enhance the primordial neutron-to-proton\nratio, and increase the amount of helium that is ultimately produced.\nAdditionally, the products of Hawking evaporation can break up helium nuclei,\nwhich both reduces the helium abundance and increases the abundance of\nprimordial deuterium. Building upon previous work, we make use of modern\ndeuterium and helium measurements to derive stringent constraints on black\nholes which evaporate in $t_{\\rm evap} \\sim 10^{-1}$ s to $\\sim 10^{13}$ s\n(corresponding to $M \\sim 6\\times 10^8$ g to $\\sim 2 \\times 10^{13}$ g,\nassuming Standard Model particle content).

Our approach only requires that each algorithm satisfy a\nhigh probability regret bound.\n  Our procedure is very simple and essentially does the following: for a well\nchosen sequence of probabilities $(p_{t})_{t\\geq 1}$, at each round $t$, it\neither chooses at random which candidate to follow (with probability $p_{t}$)\nor compares, at the same internal sample size for each candidate, the\ncumulative reward of each, and selects the one that wins the comparison (with\nprobability $1-p_{t}$).\n  To the best of our knowledge, our proposal is the first one to be\nrate-adaptive for a collection of general black-box contextual bandit\nalgorithms: it achieves the same regret rate as the best candidate.\n  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with simulation studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jun 2020 18:55:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-09"}

The first is the disentangled attention mechanism, where\neach word is represented using two vectors that encode its content and\nposition, respectively, and the attention weights among words are computed\nusing disentangled matrices on their contents and relative positions,\nrespectively.

Saturation of magnetic flux triggers eruption\nevents, where magnetically dominated plasma is expelled from near the horizon\nand forms a rotating, spiral structure.

We study\nnear-infrared observables from one sample event to show that the emission\nmorphology tracks the boundary of the magnetically dominated region.

As such,\nthis model is closer to typical models considered in path planning problems,\nalthough applied here to the visit of n cities in a non-predetermined order.

When\napplied to certain fermionic systems, or to the calculation of\nout-of-equilibrium physics, these methods encounter the so-called sign problem,\nand computational resource requirements become impractically large. These\ndifficulties prevent the calculation from first principles of the equation of\nstate of quantum chromodynamics, as well as the computation of transport\ncoefficients in quantum field theories, among other things.\n  This thesis details two methods for mitigating or avoiding the sign problem.\nFirst, via the complexification of the field variables and the application of\nCauchy's integral theorem, the difficulty of the sign problem can be changed.\nThis requires searching for a suitable contour of integration. Several methods\nof finding such a contour are discussed, as well as the procedure for\nintegrating on it. Two notable examples are highlighted: in one case, a contour\nexists which entirely removes the sign problem, and in another, there is\nprovably no contour available to improve the sign problem by more than a\n(parametrically) small amount.\n  As an alternative, physical simulations can be performed with the aid of a\nquantum computer. The formal elements underlying a quantum computation - that\nis, a Hilbert space, unitary operators acting on it, and Hermitian observables\nto be measured - can be matched to those of a quantum field theory. In this way\nan error-corrected quantum computer may be made to serve as a well controlled\nlaboratory. Precise algorithms for this task are presented, specifically in the\ncontext of quantum chromodynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jun 2020 20:57:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2020 02:28:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-23"}

However, as dilated convolutional filters\ndo not possess positional knowledge about the pixels on semantically meaningful\ncontours, they could lead to ambiguous predictions on object boundaries. In\naddition, although dilating the filter can expand its receptive field, the\ntotal number of sampled pixels remains unchanged, which usually comprises a\nsmall fraction of the receptive field's total area. Inspired by the Lateral\nInhibition (LI) mechanisms in human visual systems, we propose the dilated\nconvolution with lateral inhibitions (LI-Convs) to overcome these limitations.\nIntroducing LI mechanisms improves the convolutional filter's sensitivity to\nsemantic object boundaries. Moreover, since LI-Convs also implicitly take the\npixels from the laterally inhibited zones into consideration, they can also\nextract features at a denser scale.

With the advances in the Internet of Things (IoT),\ndata-driven approaches for prognostics that leverage the power of machine\nlearning models are gaining popularity. One of the most important categories of\ndata-driven approaches relies on a predefined or learned health indicator to\ncharacterize the equipment condition up to the present time and make inference\non how it is likely to evolve in the future. In these approaches, health\nindicator forecasting that constructs the health indicator curve over the\nlifespan using partially observed measurements (i.e., health indicator values\nwithin an initial period) plays a key role. Existing health indicator\nforecasting algorithms, such as the functional Empirical Bayesian approach, the\nregression-based formulation, a naive scenario matching based on the nearest\nneighbor, have certain limitations. In this paper, we propose a new `generative\n+ scenario matching' algorithm for health indicator forecasting. The key idea\nbehind the proposed approach is to first non-parametrically fit the underlying\nhealth indicator curve with a continuous Gaussian Process using a sample of\nrun-to-failure health indicator curves. The proposed approach then generates a\nrich set of random curves from the learned distribution, attempting to obtain\nall possible variations of the target health condition evolution process over\nthe system's lifespan.

More\nimportantly, given that SARS-CoV-2 pathogenicity is highly age-dependent, it is\ncritical to integrate aging signatures into drug discovery platforms. We here\ntake advantage of large-scale transcriptional drug screens combined with\nRNA-seq data of the lung epithelium with SARS-CoV-2 infection as well as the\naging lung. To identify robust druggable protein targets, we propose a\nprincipled causal framework that makes use of multiple data modalities. Our\nanalysis highlights the importance of serine/threonine and tyrosine kinases as\npotential targets that intersect the SARS-CoV-2 and aging pathways. By\nintegrating transcriptomic, proteomic and structural data that is available for\nmany diseases, our drug discovery platform is broadly applicable. Rigorous in\nvitro experiments as well as clinical trials are needed to validate the\nidentified candidate drugs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jun 2020 23:16:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-28"}

Much effort has been devoted to developing \"pre-processing\" tools\nfor calcium video data, addressing the important issues of e.g., motion\ncorrection, denoising, compression, demixing, and deconvolution. However,\nstatistical modeling of deconvolved calcium signals (i.e., the estimated\nactivity extracted by a pre-processing pipeline) is just as critical for\ninterpreting calcium measurements, and for incorporating these observations\ninto downstream probabilistic encoding and decoding models. Surprisingly, these\nissues have to date received significantly less attention. In this work we\nexamine the statistical properties of the deconvolved activity estimates, and\ncompare probabilistic models for these random signals. In particular, we\npropose a zero-inflated gamma (ZIG) model, which characterizes the calcium\nresponses as a mixture of a gamma distribution and a point mass that serves to\nmodel zero responses. We apply the resulting models to neural encoding and\ndecoding problems.

Previous works generally extract the global\nimage features and attempt to generate a paragraph that is similar to\nreferenced reports; however, this approach has two limitations. Firstly, the\nregions of primary interest to radiologists are usually located in a small area\nof the global image, meaning that the remainder parts of the image could be\nconsidered as irrelevant noise in the training procedure. Secondly, there are\nmany similar sentences used in each medical report to describe the normal\nregions of the image, which causes serious data bias.

In the limit where the signaling compartments are circular disks with a\nsmall common radius $\\epsilon \\ll 1$ and where the bulk diffusivity is\nasymptotically large, a matched asymptotic analysis is used to reduce the\ndimensionless PDE-ODE system into a nonlinear ODE system with global coupling.\nFor Sel'kov reaction kinetics, this ODE system for the intracellular dynamics\nand the spatial average of the bulk diffusion field is then used to investigate\noscillatory instabilities in the dynamics of the cells that are triggered due\nto the global coupling.

The softening of the EoS by the PT at higher densities, i.e. after\nmerging, leads to a characteristic increase of the dominant postmerger GW\nfrequency f_peak relative to the tidal deformability Lambda inferred during the\npremerger inspiral phase. Hence, measuring such an increase of the postmerger\nfrequency provides evidence for the presence of a strong PT. If the postmerger\nfrequency and the tidal deformability are compatible with results from purely\nbaryonic EoS models yielding very tight relations between f_peak and Lambda, a\nstrong PT can be excluded up to a certain density. We find tight correlations\nof f_peak and Lambda with the maximum density during the early postmerger\nremnant evolution. These GW observables thus inform about the density regime\nwhich is probed by the remnant and its GW emission.

The data-driven feature of deep models requires training\ndata to cover a large distribution. Therefore, it is substantial to integrate\nknowledge from multiple datasets, especially for medical images. However,\nlearning a disease classification model with extra Chest X-ray (CXR) data is\nyet challenging. Recent researches have demonstrated that performance\nbottleneck exists in joint training on different CXR datasets, and few made\nefforts to address the obstacle. In this paper, we argue that incorporating an\nexternal CXR dataset leads to imperfect training data, which raises the\nchallenges. Specifically, the imperfect data is in two folds: domain\ndiscrepancy, as the image appearances vary across datasets; and label\ndiscrepancy, as different datasets are partially labeled. To this end, we\nformulate the multi-label thoracic disease classification problem as weighted\nindependent binary tasks according to the categories.

Using standardized vision benchmarks, we prove the ability of the\nproposed methodology to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy with various\ndatasets, backbone architectures and few-shot settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Jun 2020 07:32:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 2020 12:43:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2021 10:03:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-27"}

The recently\ndescribed lower bound $\\sqrt{|l|}$ to the number of oscillations of UFVs with\npropagation-invariant temporal shape (isodiffracting UFVs) is found to hold on\naverage also for UFVs of general type, with variations along the propagation\ndirection above and below that bound, even vanishing locally. These variations\nare determined by the so-called Porras factor or $g_0$-factor characterizing\nthe dependence of the Rayleigh distance of the spectral constituents with\nfrequency. With a given available bandwidth, UFVs must widen temporally with\nincreasing magnitude of the topological charge, and must widen or may shrink\ntemporally during propagation as a result of the axially varying,\n$g_0$-dependent lower bound.

In Bankrupt, the spy communicates with the\nreceiver by issuing RDMA network packets to a private memory region allocated\nto it on a different machine (an intermediary). The receiver similarly\nallocates a separate memory region on the same intermediary, also accessed via\nRDMA. By steering RDMA packets to a specific set of remote memory addresses,\nthe spy causes deep queuing at one memory bank, which is the finest addressable\ninternal unit of main memory. This exposes a timing channel that the receiver\ncan listen on by issuing probe packets to addresses mapped to the same bank but\nin its own private memory region.

We argue that a first important step\ntowards such CCTV-aware solutions must be a mapping system (e.g., Google Maps,\nOpenStreetMap) that provides both privacy and safety routing and navigation\noptions. However, this in turn requires that the mapping system contains\nupdated information on CCTV cameras' exact geo-location, coverage area, and\npossibly other meta-data (e.g., resolution, facial recognition features,\noperator). Such information is however missing from current mapping systems,\nand there are several ways to fix this. One solution is to perform CCTV camera\ndetection on geo-location tagged images, e.g., street view imagery on various\nplatforms, user images publicly posted in image sharing platforms such as\nFlickr.

A flow between two parallel walls with an\nimposed perpendicular magnetic field is considered. The flow is defined by its\nmaximum velocity and the intensity of the magnetic field. Given the\ncorresponding Reynolds and Hartmann numbers, we derive an upper bound for the\ndimension of the attractor and find out which modes must be chosen to achieve\nthis bound. Thier, are compared to heuristics estimates for the size of the\nsmallest scales and anisotropy of the turbulence. We identify boundaries\nseparating different sets of modes in the space of non-dimensional parameters,\nwhich are reminiscent of three important previously identified transitions\nobserved in the real flow. The first boundary separates classical hydrodynamic\nsets of modes from MHD sets where anisotropy takes the form of a ``Joule\ncone''. The second boundary separates 3D MHD sets from quasi-2D MHD sets. The\nthird separates sets where all the modes exhibit the same boundary layer\nthickness or so, and sets where many different ``boundary layer modes''\nco-exists in the set. The non-dimensional relations defining these boundaries\nare then compared to the heuristics known for the transition between isotropic\nand anisotropic MHD turbulence, 3D and quasi-2D MHD turbulence and that between\na turbulent and a laminar Hartmann layer. In addition to this 3D approach, we\nalso determine upper bounds for the dimension of forced turbulent flows\nmodelled using a 2D MHD equation, relevant in the quasi-2D MHD regime.

On the\nother hand, supervised machine learning methods can generate complex non-Markov\nsequences, but these sequences are vulnerable against perturbations. Further,\nconcatenation of newly learned sequence to the already learned one is difficult\ndue to catastrophe forgetting, although concatenation is essential for\ncognitive functions such as inference. How stable complex sequences are\ngenerated still remains unclear. We have developed a neural network with fast\nand slow dynamics, which are inspired by the experiments.

We stress out that our novel\nframework does not require access or knowledge of the internal structure or the\ntraining data of the black-box model. We conduct experiments with two\ngenerative models, VAEs and GANs, and synthesize exemplars for various data\nformats, image, text and tabular, demonstrating that our framework is generic.\nWe also employ our prototype synthetization framework on various black-box\nmodels, for which we only know the input and the output formats, showing that\nit is model-agnostic. Moreover, we compare our framework (available at\nhttps://github.com/antoniobarbalau/exemplar) with a model-dependent approach\nbased on gradient descent, proving that our framework obtains equally-good\nexemplars in a shorter computational time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Jun 2020 15:46:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2020 14:17:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 4 Aug 2020 17:05:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-05"}

Unlike\nexisting methods that aim to learn physical systems in an end-to-end manner,\nour approach guarantees long-term stability and therefore leads to more\naccurate solutions.

Hence, performance improvement needs\nknowledge and control of the spatial domain. In particular, antenna structure\nand radiation parameters affect the beamforming performance in mmWave\ncommunications systems. In order to address the impairments such as beam\nmisalignments, outage loss, tracking inability, blockage, etc., an optimum\nvalue of the beamwidth must be determined. In our previous paper, assuming a\ncommunication system that creates a beam per cluster, we theoretically\ninvestigated the beamwidth-received power relation in the cluster level mmWave\nchannels. We used uniform linear array (ULA) antenna in our analysis. In this\npaper, we revisit the analysis and update the expressions for the scenario\nwhere we use rectangular uniform planar array (R-UPA) antenna.

Combining antenna and channel gains, in case of the\nperfect alignment, we confirm that the optimum beamwidth converges zero.\nPerforming asymptotic analysis of the received power, we give the formulation\nand insights that the practical nonzero beamwidth values can be achieved\nalthough sacrificing subtle from the maximum received power. Our analysis shows\nthat to reach 95% of the maximum power for a typical indoor mmWave cluster, a\npractical beamwidth of 3.5 deg is enough. Finally, our analysis results show\nthat there is a 13 dB increase in the maximum theoretical received power when\nUPA is used over ULA.

Using deep models to realize automated infection\nmeasurement and COVID-19 diagnosis is important for faster examination based on\nradiological imaging. Unfortunately, collecting large training data\nsystematically in the early stage is difficult. To address this problem, we\nexplore the feasibility of learning deep models for COVID-19 diagnosis from a\nsingle radiological image by resorting to synthesizing diverse radiological\nimages. Specifically, we propose a novel conditional generative model, called\nCoSinGAN, which can be learned from a single radiological image with a given\ncondition, i.e., the annotations of the lung and COVID-19 infection. Our\nCoSinGAN is able to capture the conditional distribution of visual finds of\nCOVID-19 infection, and further synthesize diverse and high-resolution\nradiological images that match the input conditions precisely. Both deep\nclassification and segmentation networks trained on synthesized samples from\nCoSinGAN achieve notable detection accuracy of COVID-19 infection. Such results\nare significantly better than the counterparts trained on the same extremely\nsmall number of real samples (1 or 2 real samples) by using strong data\naugmentation, and approximate to the counterparts trained on large dataset\n(2846 real images). It confirms our method can significantly reduce the\nperformance gap between deep models trained on extremely small dataset and on\nlarge dataset, and thus has the potential to realize learning COVID-19\ndiagnosis from few radiological images in the early stage of COVID-19 pandemic.\nOur codes are made publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/PengyiZhang/CoSinGAN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Jun 2020 07:41:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-23"}

Forecasting country-wise\nCOVID-19 cases is necessary to help policymakers and healthcare providers\nprepare for the future. This study explores the performance of several Long\nShort-Term Memory (LSTM) models and Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average\n(ARIMA) model in forecasting the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases. Time\nseries of daily cumulative COVID-19 cases were used for generating 1-day,\n3-day, and 5-day forecasts using several LSTM models and ARIMA. Two novel\nk-period performance metrics - k-day Mean Absolute Percentage Error (kMAPE) and\nk-day Median Symmetric Accuracy (kMdSA) - were developed for evaluating the\nperformance of the models in forecasting time series values for multiple days.\nErrors in prediction using kMAPE and kMdSA for LSTM models were both as low as\n0.05%, while those for ARIMA were 0.07% and 0.06% respectively. LSTM models\nslightly underestimated while ARIMA slightly overestimated the numbers in the\nforecasts. The performance of LSTM models is comparable to ARIMA in forecasting\nCOVID-19 cases. While ARIMA requires longer sequences, LSTMs can perform\nreasonably well with sequence sizes as small as 3. However, LSTMs require a\nlarge number of training samples. Further, the development of k-period\nperformance metrics proposed is likely to be useful for performance evaluation\nof time series models in predicting multiple periods. Based on the k-period\nperformance metrics proposed, both LSTMs and ARIMA are useful for time series\nanalysis and forecasting for COVID-19.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jun 2020 20:07:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-25"}

It involves analyzing social media data generated during\nnatural disasters, crisis events, or other mass convergence events.

Maintenance\ncosts are high since there is a need for queries to be handled quickly which\nrequire large amounts of computational resources to be available on demand 24\nhours a day, seven days a week.

Understanding how the stroke-induced motor\nimpairments interact with each other can help design assisted training regimens\nfor improved recovery. In this study, we investigate the effects of abnormal\njoint coupling patterns induced by flexion synergy on timing-sensitive motor\ncoordination in the paretic upper limb. We design a virtual ball-in-bowl task\nthat requires fast movements for optimal performance and implement it on a\nrobotic system, capable of providing varying levels of abduction loading at the\nshoulder. We recruit 12 participants (6 individuals with chronic stroke and 6\nunimpaired controls) and assess their skill at the task at 3 levels of loading,\ndefined by the vertical force applied at the robot end-effector. Our results\nshow that, for individuals with stroke, loading has a significant effect on\ntheir ability to generate quick coordinated motion. With increases in loading,\ntheir overall task performance decreases and they are less able to compensate\nfor ball dynamics---frequency analysis of their motion indicates that abduction\nloading weakens their ability to generate movements at the resonant frequency\nof the dynamic task. This effect is likely due to an increased reliance on\nlower resolution indirect motor pathways in individuals post stroke. Given the\ninter-dependency of loading and dynamic task performance, we can create\ntargeted robot-aided training protocols focused on improving timing-sensitive\nmotor control, similar to existing progressive loading therapies, which have\nshown efficacy for expanding reachable workspace post stroke.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jun 2020 17:15:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-10"}

In this article, the focus is on electrochemical cells. In\norder to predict a cell's fault, the typical approach is to estimate the\nexpected voltage that a healthy cell would present and compare it with the\ncell's measured voltage in real-time. This approach is possible because, when a\nfault is about to happen, the cell's measured voltage differs from the one\nexpected for the same operating conditions. However, estimating the expected\nvoltage is challenging, as the voltage of a healthy cell is also affected by\nits degradation -- an unknown parameter. Expert-defined parametric models are\ncurrently used for this estimation task. Instead, we propose the use of a\nneural network model based on an encoder-decoder architecture. The network\nreceives the operating conditions as input. The encoder's task is to find a\nfaithful representation of the cell's degradation and to pass it to the\ndecoder, which in turn predicts the expected cell's voltage. As no labeled\ndegradation data is given to the network, we consider our approach to be a\nself-supervised encoder. Results show that we were able to predict the voltage\nof multiple cells while diminishing the prediction error that was obtained by\nthe parametric models by 53%. This improvement enabled our network to predict a\nfault 31 hours before it happened, a 64% increase in reaction time compared to\nthe parametric model. Moreover, the output of the encoder can be plotted,\nadding interpretability to the neural network model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jun 2020 21:21:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-28"}
