In this scenario, a user purchases a set of items (a basket) at a\ntime. NBR performs sequential modeling and recommendation based on a sequence\nof baskets. NBR is in general more complex than the widely studied sequential\n(session-based) recommendation which recommends the next item based on a\nsequence of items. Recurrent neural network (RNN) has proved to be very\neffective for sequential modeling and thus been adapted for NBR. However, we\nargue that existing RNNs cannot directly capture item frequency information in\nthe recommendation scenario.\n  Through careful analysis of real-world datasets, we find that {\\em\npersonalized item frequency} (PIF) information (which records the number of\ntimes that each item is purchased by a user) provides two critical signals for\nNBR. But, this has been largely ignored by existing methods. Even though\nexisting methods such as RNN based methods have strong representation ability,\nour empirical results show that they fail to learn and capture PIF. As a\nresult, existing methods cannot fully exploit the critical signals contained in\nPIF. Given this inherent limitation of RNNs, we propose a simple item frequency\nbased k-nearest neighbors (kNN) method to directly utilize these critical\nsignals. We evaluate our method on four public real-world datasets. Despite its\nrelative simplicity, our method frequently outperforms the state-of-the-art NBR\nmethods -- including deep learning based methods using RNNs -- when patterns\nassociated with PIF play an important role in the data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 May 2020 16:42:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-02"}

This background is\nsuppressed by requiring a high-transverse-momentum (high-$p_T$) leading hadron\nin accepted jet candidates. The bias imposed by this requirement is assessed,\nand the $p_T$ region in which the bias is small is identified.

NeuHash-CF is modelled as an\nautoencoder architecture, consisting of two joint hashing components for\ngenerating user and item hash codes.

Methods: We observed the GC region for\n${\\approx}100$ hours with the MAGIC telescopes from 2012 to 2017, at high\nzenith angles (58-70~deg). This implies a larger energy threshold, but also an\nincreased effective collection area compared to low zenith observations. Using\nnew software, we derive instrument response and background models, enabling us\nto study the diffuse emission in the region. We use pre-existing data of the\ngas distribution in the GC region to derive the underlying distribution of CRs.\nResults: We obtain a significant detection for all four model components used\nto fit our data (Sgr~A*, ``Arc'', G0.9+0.1, and an extended component for the\nGalactic Ridge).

Most of the literature either designs methodology for\na retrospective analysis, where the whole sample is already available when the\nstatistical inference begins, or considers online detection schemes controlling\nthe average time until a false alarm. This paper takes a different point of\nview and develops monitoring schemes for the online scenario, where high\ndimensional data arrives successively and the goal is to detect changes as fast\nas possible controlling at the same time the probability of a type I error of a\nfalse alarm. We develop a sequential procedure capable of detecting changes in\nthe mean vector of a successively observed high dimensional time series with\nspatial and temporal dependence. The statistical properties of the method are\nanalyzed in the case where both, thesample size and dimension tend to infinity.\nIn this scenario, it is shown that the new monitoring scheme has asymptotic\nlevel alpha under the null hypothesis of no change and is consistent under the\nalternative of a change in at least one component of the high dimensional mean\nvector. The approach is based on a new type of monitoring scheme for\none-dimensional data which turns out to be often more powerful than the usually\nused CUSUM and Page-CUSUM methods, and the component-wise statistics are\naggregated by the maximum statistic. For the analysis of the asymptotic\nproperties of our monitoring scheme we prove that the range of a Brownian\nmotion on a given interval is in the domain of attraction of the Gumbel\ndistribution, which is a result of independent interest in extreme value\ntheory.

We hypothesize 'accessible population for\ntransmission of the disease' to be a small fraction of the total population,\nfor instance when interventions are in force. This hypothesis, together with\nthe structure of the set of coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations\nfor the populations, allows us to decouple the equations into just two\nequations. This further reduces to a logistic type of equation for the total\ninfected population. The equation can be solved analytically and therefore\nallows for a clear interpretation of the growth and inhibiting factors in terms\nof the parameters in the full model. The validity of the 'accessible\npopulation' hypothesis and the efficacy of the reduced logistic model is\ndemonstrated by the ease of fitting the United Kingdom data for the cumulative\ninfected and daily new infected cases. The model can also be used to forecast\nfurther progression of the disease. In an effort to find optimized parameter\nvalues compatible with the United Kingdom coronavirus data, we first determine\nthe relative importance of the various transition rates participating in the\noriginal model.

Most existing researches on RIS assume that the hardware operations\nare perfect. However, both physical transceiver and RIS suffer from inevitable\nhardware impairments in practice, which can lead to severe system performance\ndegradation and increase the complexity of beamforming optimization.\nConsequently, the existing researches on RIS, including channel estimation,\nbeamforming optimization, spectrum and energy efficiency analysis, etc., cannot\ndirectly apply to the case of hardware impairments. In this paper, by taking\nhardware impairments into consideration, we conduct the joint transmit and\nreflect beamforming optimization, and reevaluate the system performance. First,\nwe characterize the closed-form estimators of direct and cascaded channels in\nboth single-user and multi-user cases, and analyze the impact of hardware\nimpairments on channel estimation accuracy. Then, the optimal transmit\nbeamforming solution is derived, and a gradient descent method-based algorithm\nis also proposed to optimize the reflect beamforming. Moreover, we analyze the\nthree types of asymptotic channel capacities with respect to the transmit\npower, the antenna number, and the reflecting element number. Finally, in terms\nof the system energy consumption, we analyze the power scaling law and the\nenergy efficiency. Our experimental results also reveal an encouraging\nphenomenon that the RIS-assisted wireless system with massive reflecting\nelements can achieve both high spectrum and energy efficiency without the need\nfor massive antennas and without allocating too many resources to optimize the\nreflect beamforming.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jun 2020 01:47:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Aug 2021 04:59:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 4 Jun 2022 09:00:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-07"}

Inspired by information theory, we propose a novel method that\neffectively manifests disentangled representations of text, without any\nsupervision on semantics. A new mutual information upper bound is derived and\nleveraged to measure dependence between style and content. By minimizing this\nupper bound, the proposed method induces style and content embeddings into two\nindependent low-dimensional spaces. Experiments on both conditional text\ngeneration and text-style transfer demonstrate the high quality of our\ndisentangled representation in terms of content and style preservation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jun 2020 03:36:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 6 Jun 2020 17:38:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 12 Jan 2022 17:43:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-13"}

In a large scale\nlocation-based services system, users issue TSP queries concurrently, where a\nTSP query is a TSP instance with $n$ points. In the literature, many advanced\nTSP solvers are developed to find high-quality solutions. Such solvers can\nsolve some TSP instances efficiently but may take an extremely long time for\nsome other instances. Due to the diversity of TSP instances, it is well-known\nthat there exists no universal best solver dominating all other solvers on all\npossible TSP instances. To solve TSP efficiently, in addition to developing new\nTSP solvers, it needs to find a per-instance solver for each TSP instance,\nwhich is known as the TSP solver selection problem. In this paper, for the\nfirst time, we propose a deep learning framework, \\CTAS, for TSP solver\nselection in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, \\CTAS exploits deep\nconvolutional neural networks to extract informative features from TSP\ninstances and involves data argumentation strategies to handle the scarcity of\nlabeled TSP instances. Moreover, to support large scale TSP solver selection,\nwe construct a challenging TSP benchmark dataset with 6,000 instances, which is\nknown as the largest TSP benchmark.

Here, we study the mass\nof the high-speed ejecta that escapes from the target gravity by cratering\nimpacts when material strength is neglected. We perform a large number of\ncratering impact simulations onto a planar rocky target using the smoothed\nparticle hydrodynamics method. We show that the escape mass of the target\nmaterial obtained from our numerical simulations agrees with the prediction of\na scaling law under a point-source assumption when $v_{\\rm imp} \\gtrsim 12\nv_{\\rm esc}$, where $v_{\\rm imp}$ is the impact velocity and $v_{\\rm esc}$ is\nthe escape velocity of the target.

The article reports the control over the\nvaporization kinetics of pendent droplets under the influence of competing\ninternal electrohydrodynamic and ferrohydrodynamic advection. Experimental and\ntheoretical studies are performed and the morphing of vaporization kinetics of\nelectrically conducting and paramagnetic fluid droplets using orthogonal\nelectric and magnetic stimuli is established. Analysis of the observations\nreveals that the electric field has a domineering influence compared to the\nmagnetic field. While the magnetic field is noted to aid the vaporization\nrates, the electric field is observed to decelerate the same. Neither the\nvapour diffusion dominated kinetics nor the field induced modified surface\ntension can explain the observed vaporization behaviours.

The slip stick and jump stick modes are prominent during\nevaporation. For droplets on inclined substrates, the evaporative flux is also\nasymmetric and governed by the initial contact angle dissimilarity. Due to\nsmaller contact angle at the rear contact line, it is the zone of a higher\nevaporative flux. Particle image velocimetry shows the increased internal\ncirculation velocity within the inclined droplets. Asymmetry in the evaporative\nflux leads to higher temperature gradients, which ultimately enhances the\nthermal Marangoni circulation near the rear of the droplet where the\nevaporative flux is highest. A model is adopted to predict the thermal\nMarangoni advection velocity, and good match is obtained.

In most early settings of crowdsourcing, the task involved\nclassification, that is assigning one of a discrete set of labels to each task.\nRecently, however, more complex tasks have been attempted including asking\ncrowdsource workers to assign continuous labels, or predictions. In essence,\nthis involves the use of crowdsourcing for function estimation. We are\nmotivated by this problem to drive applications such as collaborative\nprediction, that is, harnessing the wisdom of the crowd to predict quantities\nmore accurately. To do so, we propose a Bayesian approach aimed specifically at\nalleviating overfitting, a typical impediment to accurate prediction models in\npractice. In particular, we develop a variational Bayesian technique for two\ndifferent worker noise models - one that assumes workers' noises are\nindependent and the other that assumes workers' noises have a latent low-rank\nstructure. Our evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate\nthat these Bayesian approaches perform significantly better than existing\nnon-Bayesian approaches and are thus potentially useful for this class of\ncrowdsourcing problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jun 2020 08:11:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2020 02:53:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-03"}

It is shown from numerical\nsimulations that maximizing interfacial area between filler and polymer\nenhances very significantly the effective thermal conductivity in composites.\nOur study outlines two main facts. (a) Although the nature of the filler's\ngeometry plays an important role in the effective thermal conductivity, we show\nthat among the different geometries thermal conductivity is high for those\ngeometries for which the ratio of surface-area to volume is high. Thus\nnon-spherical shaped fillers show high thermal conductivity compared to the\nspherical fillers. (b) For fillers of a particular geometry, by maximizing its\nsurface area without changing the volume fraction of the metallic filler, the\neffective thermal conductivity increases. Thus, the interfacial area between\nfiller and polymer plays an important role in the enhancement of thermal\nconductivity. Maximizing interfaces facilitates more routes for heat conduction\nthrough the metallic filler. Thus filler material can be transformed to result\ninto more surface such that more interfaces between the filer polymer can be\nobtained. It is also observed that as this interfacial area increases, increase\nin effective thermal conductivity follows from linear to the logarithmic\ngrowth. It should be noted that to inherit the polymer properties there is a\nrestriction on the upper bound of volume fraction of the fillers. The current\nstudy bring out an important step in this direction. Our results are\ntechnologically very important in designing composite polymers for better heat\nconduction, and are very cost-effective.

Hence the availability of\ncomputational tools capable of analysing the observability of nonlinear systems\nwith unknown inputs has been limited until lately. Two symbolic algorithms\nbased on differential geometry, ORC-DF and FISPO, have been recently proposed\nfor this task, but their critical analysis and comparison is still lacking.\nHere we perform an analytical comparison of both algorithms and evaluate their\nperformance on a set of problems, discussing their strengths and limitations.\nAdditionally, we use these analyses to provide insights about certain aspects\nof the relationship between inputs and observability.

The\nFISPO algorithm is more generally applicable, since it can analyse any\nnonlinear ODE model. The ORC-DF algorithm analyses models that are affine in\nthe inputs, and if those models have known inputs it is sometimes more\nefficient. Thus, the optimal choice of a method depends on the characteristics\nof the problem under consideration.

However, it is generally NP-hard to retrieve the group elements by\nfinding the least squares estimator.

The\nsimplified Transformer uses a 2-stream attention-based mechanism to model\nhyper-parameter dependencies while avoiding layer normalization and position\nencoding. We posit that this parsimonious design balances model complexity\nagainst expressiveness, making it suitable for discovering optimal\narchitectures in high-dimensional search spaces with limited exploration\nbudgets. We demonstrate how the algorithm's performance can be further improved\nby a) using an actor-critic style algorithm instead of plain vanilla policy\ngradient and b) ensembling Transformer blocks with shared parameters, each\nblock conditioned on a different auto-regressive factorization order. Our\nalgorithm works well as both a NAS and generic hyper-parameter optimization\n(HPO) algorithm: it outperformed most algorithms on NAS-Bench-101, a public\ndata-set for benchmarking NAS algorithms. In particular, it outperformed RL\nbased methods that use alternate architectures to model the policy network,\nunderlining the value of using attention-based networks in this setting. As a\ngeneric HPO algorithm, it outperformed Random Search in discovering more\naccurate multi-layer perceptron model architectures across 2 regression tasks.\nWe have adhered to guidelines listed in Lindauer and Hutter while designing\nexperiments and reporting results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jun 2020 13:35:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2020 02:27:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 2 Nov 2020 07:38:20 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 5 Nov 2020 04:55:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-06"}

To address these concerns this work\ndescribes Acme, a framework for constructing novel RL algorithms that is\nspecifically designed to enable agents that are built using simple, modular\ncomponents that can be used at various scales of execution.

The crucial steps\ninclude constructing the velocity distribution functions (VDFs) for points at\nthe plate surfaces and inside flowfield, and then completing the integration\nover the related velocity phases. For diffusely reflective surfaces, the VDFs\nare related to the densities and temperatures at the two exits and the plate\ntemperatures. For surfaces with specular reflections, the VDFs at the plate\nsurface and inside the flowfield are identical, and independent of the surface\ntemperature ratio and the geometric aspect ratio.

Here, we develop a semi-supervised drug\nembedding that incorporates two sources of information: (1) underlying chemical\ngrammar that is inferred from molecular structures of drugs and drug-like\nmolecules (unsupervised), and (2) hierarchical relations that are encoded in an\nexpert-crafted hierarchy of approved drugs (supervised).

Backprojection is a popular class of algorithm for tomographic\nreconstruction, however it typically results in poor image reconstructions when\nthe projection angles are sparse and/or if the sensors characteristics are not\nuniform. Several deep learning based algorithms have been developed to solve\nthis inverse problem and reconstruct the image using a limited number of\nprojections.

A\nstriking example is the creation of flat-bands in bilayer-graphene for certain\n'magic' twist-angles between the orientations of the two layers. The quenched\nkinetic-energy in these flat-bands promotes electron-electron interactions and\nfacilitates the emergence of strongly-correlated phases such as\nsuperconductivity and correlated-insulators. However, the exquisite fine-tuning\nrequired for finding the magic-angle where flat-bands appear in twisted-bilayer\ngraphene, poses challenges to fabrication and scalability. Here we present an\nalternative route to creating flat-bands that does not involve fine tuning.\nUsing scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, together with numerical\nsimulations, we demonstrate that graphene monolayers placed on an\natomically-flat substrate can be forced to undergo a buckling-transition,\nresulting in a periodically modulated pseudo-magnetic field, which in turn\ncreates a post-graphene material with flat electronic bands. Bringing the\nFermi-level into these flat-bands by electrostatic doping, we observe a\npseudogap-like depletion in the density-of-states, which signals the emergence\nof a correlated-state. The described approach of 2D crystal buckling offers a\nstrategy for creating other superlattice systems and, in particular, for\nexploring interaction phenomena characteristic of flat-bands.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jun 2020 03:26:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-15"}

Furthermore, we estimate the\nnew generalized uncertainty principle parameter $\\gamma _0$ by applying various\ndata of Bok globules, and find that the range of magnitude of $\\gamma _0$ is\n${10^{11}} \\sim {10^{12}}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jun 2020 13:04:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2020 02:16:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 16 Aug 2021 14:27:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-26"}

We use high-resolution spectropolarimetric observations in the Ca ii\n8542 A line obtained with the SST to study the magnetic field in solar\nspicules. Methods. The equations that result from the application of the Weak\nField Approximation (WFA) to the radiative transfer equations are used to infer\nthe LOS component of the magnetic field (BLOS). Two restrictive conditions are\nimposed on the Stokes I and V profiles at each pixel before they can be used in\na Bayesian inversion to compute its BLOS. Results. The LOS magnetic field\ncomponent has been inferred in six data sets totalling 448 spectral scans in\nthe Ca ii 8542 A line and containing both active region and quiet Sun areas,\nwith values of hundreds of G being abundantly inferred. There seems to be no\ndifference, from the statistical point of view, between the magnetic field\nstrength of spicules in the quiet Sun or near an active region. On the other\nhand, the BLOS distributions present smaller values on the disk than off-limb,\na fact that can be explained by the effect of superposition on the chromosphere\nof on-disk structures.

In order\nto make the data less sparse and more statistically significant, the\ndimensionality reduction techniques are needed. But in the existing\ndimensionality reduction techniques, the number of components needs to be set\nmanually which results in loss of the most prominent features, thus reducing\nthe performance of the classifiers. Our prior work, i.e., Term Presence Count\n(TPC) and Term Presence Ratio (TPR) have proven to be effective techniques as\nthey reject the less separable features.

Although many OS\ntime prediction methods have been developed and obtain promising results, there\nare still several issues. First, conventional prediction methods rely on\nradiomic features at the local lesion area of a magnetic resonance (MR) volume,\nwhich may not represent the full image or model complex tumor patterns. Second,\ndifferent types of scanners (i.e., multi-modal data) are sensitive to different\nbrain regions, which makes it challenging to effectively exploit the\ncomplementary information across multiple modalities and also preserve the\nmodality-specific properties. Third, existing methods focus on prediction\nmodels, ignoring complex data-to-label relationships. To address the above\nissues, we propose an end-to-end OS time prediction model; namely, Multi-modal\nMulti-channel Network (M2Net). Specifically, we first project the 3D MR volume\nonto 2D images in different directions, which reduces computational costs,\nwhile preserving important information and enabling pre-trained models to be\ntransferred from other tasks. Then, we use a modality-specific network to\nextract implicit and high-level features from different MR scans. A multi-modal\nshared network is built to fuse these features using a bilinear pooling model,\nexploiting their correlations to provide complementary information. Finally, we\nintegrate the outputs from each modality-specific network and the multi-modal\nshared network to generate the final prediction result. Experimental results\ndemonstrate the superiority of our M2Net model over other methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jun 2020 05:21:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Jul 2020 18:47:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-16"}

In such\nsituations, robots were pointed at to support humans to address a shortage in\nsupply. An important activity where humans are needed in a manufacturing value\nchain is assembly.

The\nperformance of RTB campaigns is generally measured with a series of Key\nPerformance Indicators (KPIs) - measurements used to ensure that the campaign\nis cost-effective and that it is purchasing valuable inventory. While an RTB\ncampaign should ideally meet all KPIs, simultaneous improvement tends to be\nvery challenging, as an improvement to any one KPI risks a detrimental effect\ntoward the others. Here we present an approach to simultaneously controlling\nmultiple KPIs with a PID-based feedback-control system. This method generates a\ncontrol score for each KPI, based on both the output of a PID controller module\nand a metric that quantifies the importance of each KPI for internal business\nneeds. On regular intervals, this algorithm - Sequential Control - will choose\nthe KPI with the greatest overall need for improvement. In this way, our\nalgorithm is able to continually seek the greatest marginal improvements to its\ncurrent state. Multiple methods of control can be associated with each KPI, and\ncan be triggered either simultaneously or chosen stochastically, in order to\navoid local optima. In both offline ad bidding simulations and testing on live\ntraffic, our methods proved to be effective in simultaneously controlling\nmultiple KPIs, and bringing them toward their respective goals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jun 2020 15:49:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-02"}
