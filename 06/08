We\npreviously demonstrated frequency domain multiplexing by convolution using a\nprototype system that multiplexed two EJ-309 organic scintillators signals into\na single channel. Each detector pulse was converted to a damped sinusoid which\nwas then combined into a single channel. The combined signal was digitized and\nthe original detector signal was recovered from the damped sinusoid by\ndeconvolution. In this paper, we demonstrate the recovery of multiple detector\nsignals that arrive during the same digitized record via a new sequential\ndeconvolution method. When two detectors produce signals in the same digitized\nrecord and their pulses do not overlap in time, we found that the charge,\narrival time, and particle type can be estimated fairly precisely for the first\npulse, but the second pulse exhibits substantial degradation in the precision\nof the estimated charge and arrival time. When the pulses overlap in time, we\ndemonstrate both theoretically and experimentally that the part of the first\npulse that does not overlap with the second can be recovered accurately, so the\narrival time and amplitude of the first pulse can be estimated fairly\nprecisely, but not the charge or particle type. None of these quantities can be\nestimated precisely for the second pulse when the two pulses overlap.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jun 2020 15:39:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 2021 00:09:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 23 Aug 2022 05:51:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-24"}

This immediate clinical driver, combined\nwith the general quest for more personalised health data, means that pulse\noximetry measurement of capillary oxygen saturation (SpO2) will likely expand\ninto both the clinical and consumer market of wearable health technology in the\nnear future. In this study, we set out to establish the feasibility of SpO2\nmeasurement from the ear canal as a convenient site for long term monitoring,\nand perform a comprehensive comparison with the right index finger - the\nconventional clinical measurement site. During resting SpO2 estimation, we\nfound a root mean square difference of 1.47% between the two measurement sites,\nwith a mean difference of 0.23% higher SpO2 in the right ear canal. Through the\nsimultaneous recording of pulse oximetry from both the right ear canal and\nindex finger during breath holds, we observe a substantial improvement in\nresponse time between the ear and finger that has a mean of 12.4 seconds and a\nrange of 4.2 - 24.2 seconds across all subjects.

These results are presented in\nconjunction with previously discovered benefits such as robustness to\ntemperature, making the case for measurement of SpO2 from the ear canal being\nboth convenient and superior to conventional finger measurement sites for\ncontinuous non-intrusive long term monitoring in both clinical and\neveryday-life settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Jun 2020 18:51:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-15"}

However, the majority of network\nembedding methods focus on learning a single vector representation for each\nnode, which has been recently criticized for not being capable of modeling\nmultiple aspects of a node. To capture the multiple aspects of each node,\nexisting studies mainly rely on offline graph clustering performed prior to the\nactual embedding, which results in the cluster membership of each node (i.e.,\nnode aspect distribution) fixed throughout training of the embedding model. We\nargue that this not only makes each node always have the same aspect\ndistribution regardless of its dynamic context, but also hinders the end-to-end\ntraining of the model that eventually leads to the final embedding quality\nlargely dependent on the clustering. In this paper, we propose a novel\nend-to-end framework for multi-aspect network embedding, called asp2vec, in\nwhich the aspects of each node are dynamically assigned based on its local\ncontext. More precisely, among multiple aspects, we dynamically assign a single\naspect to each node based on its current context, and our aspect selection\nmodule is end-to-end differentiable via the Gumbel-Softmax trick. We also\nintroduce the aspect regularization framework to capture the interactions among\nthe multiple aspects in terms of relatedness and diversity.

Their\nevolution may offer plausible explanations for the rapid decrease of the heat\nflux with the solar wind expansion, typically invoked being the self-generated\ninstabilities, or the so-called heat flux instabilities (HFIs). The present\npaper provides a unified description of the full spectrum of HFIs, as\nprescribed by the linear kinetic theory for high beta conditions ($\\beta_e \\gg\n0.1$) and different relative drifts ($U$) of the suprathermals. HFIs of\ndifferent nature are distinguished, i.e., electromagnetic, electrostatic or\nhybrid, propagating parallel or obliquely to the magnetic field, etc., as well\nas their regimes of interplay (co-existence) or dominance. These alternative\nregimes of HFIs complement each other and may be characteristic to different\nrelative drifts of suprathermal electrons and various conditions in the solar\nwind, e.g., in the slow or fast winds, streaming interaction regions and\ninterplanetary shocks. Moreover, these results strongly suggest that heat flux\nregulation may not involve only one but several HFIs, concomitantly or\nsuccessively in time. Conditions for a single, well defined instability with\nmajor effects on the suprathermal electrons and, implicitly, the heat flux,\nseem to be very limited. Whistler HFIs are more likely to occur but only for\nminor drifts (as also reported by recent observations), which may explain a\nmodest implication in their regulation, shown already in quasilinear studies\nand numerical simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Jun 2020 20:51:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Aug 2020 18:54:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-05"}

Inspired by the dropout concept, we propose EDropout as an\nenergy-based framework for pruning neural networks in classification tasks. In\nthis approach, a set of binary pruning state vectors (population) represents a\nset of corresponding sub-networks from an arbitrary provided original neural\nnetwork. An energy loss function assigns a scalar energy loss value to each\npruning state. The energy-based model stochastically evolves the population to\nfind states with lower energy loss. The best pruning state is then selected and\napplied to the original network. Similar to dropout, the kept weights are\nupdated using backpropagation in a probabilistic model. The energy-based model\nagain searches for better pruning states and the cycle continuous. Indeed, this\nprocedure is in fact switching between the energy model, which manages the\npruning states, and the probabilistic model, which updates the temporarily\nunpruned weights, in each iteration. The population can dynamically converge to\na pruning state. This can be interpreted as dropout leading to pruning the\nnetwork. From an implementation perspective, EDropout can prune typical neural\nnetworks without modification of the network architecture.

(2020b). The setting is the\nfollowing: we (the platform) offer a menu of suppliers to each customer. Then,\nevery customer selects, simultaneously and independently, to match with a\nsupplier or to remain unmatched. Each supplier observes the subset of customers\nthat selected them, and chooses either to match a customer or to leave the\nsystem. Therefore, a match takes place if both a customer and a supplier\nsequentially select each other. Each agent's behavior is probabilistic and\ndetermined by a discrete choice model. Our goal is to choose an assortment\nfamily that maximizes the expected revenue of the matching. Given the\ncomplexity of the problem, we show several constant factor approximation\nguarantees for an heterogeneous setting where customers follow different\nmultinomial logit models and suppliers follow a general choice model whose\ndemand function is monotone and submodular. Furthermore, we obtain the first\nconstant approximation guarantees when the problem is subject to cardinality\nconstraints and the objective is the revenue of the matching. Our approach\nrelies on submodular optimization techniques and appropriate randomized\nrounding methods. We also provide several extensions of our results, notably,\nthe problem becomes polynomially solvable when we allow suppliers to select an\nunlimited number of customers as long as the corresponding subproblems are\npolynomially solvable. We also discuss managerial implications of this model.\nIn particular, we show that for matching platforms it is better to allow the\nagents whose opposite side is less attractive to initiate the matchmaking\nprocess.

The work is motivated by the\nrecent serendipitous discovery in the LMC of the first confirmed extragalactic\n[WC11] star, whose spectrum is dominated by C II emission, and the realization\nthat the number of such objects is currently largely unconstrained. The survey,\nwhich imaged $\\sim$50$~$deg$^2$ using on-band and off-band filters, will\nsignificantly increase the total census of these rare stars.

We find 38 new C II emission candidates; spectroscopy of the\ncomplete sample will be needed to ascertain their nature. In a preliminary\nspectroscopic reconnaissance, we observed three candidates, finding C II\nemission in each. One is a new [WC11]. Another shows both the narrow C II\nemission lines characteristic of a [WC11], but also broad emission of C IV, O\nV, and He II characteristic of a much hotter [WC4] star; we speculate that this\nis a binary [WC]. The third object shows weak C II emission, but the spectrum\nis dominated by a dense thicket of strong absorption lines, including numerous\nO II transitions. We conclude it is likely an unusual hot, hydrogen-poor\npost-AGB star, possibly in transition from [WC] to white dwarf. Even lacking a\ncomplete spectroscopic program, we can infer that late [WC] stars do not\ndominate the central stars of LMC planetary nebulae, and that the detected C II\nemitters are largely of an old population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jun 2020 03:00:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-05"}

We chose Blensor (Gschwandtner\net al., 2011) as the baseline method to compare the point clouds generated\nusing the proposed method. The reported error for complex urban landscapes is\n4.28cm for a scanning range between 2-120 meters with Velodyne HDL64-E2\nparameters. The proposed method reported a total time per frame to 3.2 +/- 0.31\nseconds per frame. In contrast, the BlenSor baseline method reported 16.2 +/-\n1.82 seconds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jun 2020 04:07:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-25"}

In the context\nof machine learning, the majority of existing results have chosen\n$f$-divergences, Wasserstein distances and more recently, the Maximum Mean\nDiscrepancy (MMD) to construct uncertainty sets.

The classification is usually optimized by\nFocal Loss and the box location is commonly learned under Dirac delta\ndistribution. A recent trend for one-stage detectors is to introduce an\nindividual prediction branch to estimate the quality of localization, where the\npredicted quality facilitates the classification to improve detection\nperformance. This paper delves into the representations of the above three\nfundamental elements: quality estimation, classification and localization. Two\nproblems are discovered in existing practices, including (1) the inconsistent\nusage of the quality estimation and classification between training and\ninference and (2) the inflexible Dirac delta distribution for localization when\nthere is ambiguity and uncertainty in complex scenes. To address the problems,\nwe design new representations for these elements. Specifically, we merge the\nquality estimation into the class prediction vector to form a joint\nrepresentation of localization quality and classification, and use a vector to\nrepresent arbitrary distribution of box locations. The improved representations\neliminate the inconsistency risk and accurately depict the flexible\ndistribution in real data, but contain continuous labels, which is beyond the\nscope of Focal Loss. We then propose Generalized Focal Loss (GFL) that\ngeneralizes Focal Loss from its discrete form to the continuous version for\nsuccessful optimization. On COCO test-dev, GFL achieves 45.0\\% AP using\nResNet-101 backbone, surpassing state-of-the-art SAPD (43.5\\%) and ATSS\n(43.6\\%) with higher or comparable inference speed, under the same backbone and\ntraining settings.

For instance, CT and MRI have\nadvantages over each other in terms of imaging quality, artifacts, and output\ncharacteristics that lead to differential diagnosis. The capacity of current\nsegmentation techniques is only allow to work for an individual domain due to\ntheir differences. However, the models that are capable of working on all\nmodalities are essentially needed for a complete solution. Furthermore,\nrobustness is drastically affected by the number of samples in the training\nstep, especially for deep learning models. Hence, there is a necessity that all\navailable data regardless of data domain should be used for reliable methods.\nFor this purpose, this manuscript aims to implement a novel model that can\nlearn robust representations from cross-domain data by encapsulating distinct\nand shared patterns from different modalities. Precisely, covariate shift\nproperty is retained with structural modification and adversarial loss where\nsparse and rich representations are obtained. Hence, a single parameter set is\nused to perform cross-domain segmentation task. The superiority of the proposed\nmethod is that no information related to modalities are provided in either\ntraining or inference phase. The tests on CT and MRI liver data acquired in\nroutine clinical workflows show that the proposed model outperforms all other\nbaseline with a large margin. Experiments are also conducted on Covid-19\ndataset that it consists of CT data where significant intra-class visual\ndifferences are observed.

In a perturbative regime the influence of the environment on\nthe system dynamics can effectively be described by a unitary and a dissipative\ncontribution. For the two-spin Boson model with (sub-) Ohmic spectral density\nconsidered here, the particular unitary contribution (Lamb shift) easily\nexplains the buildup of entanglement between the two qubits. Furthermore it has\nbeen argued that in the adiabatic limit, adding the so-called counterterm to\nthe microscopic model compensates the unitary influence of the environment and,\nthus, inhibits the generation of entanglement. Investigating this assertion is\none of the main objectives of the work presented here. Using the hierarchy of\npure states (HOPS) method to numerically calculate the exact reduced dynamics,\nwe find and explain that the degree of inhibition crucially depends on the\nparameter $s$ determining the low frequency power law behavior of the spectral\ndensity $J(\\omega) \\sim \\omega^s e^{-\\omega/\\omega_c}$.

Empirical studies on both simulation and real datasets validate the\neffectiveness of our method in terms of uniformly good performance across\nunknown distributional shifts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jun 2020 08:42:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 May 2021 02:27:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-12"}

Results from global magnetoconvection simulations of solar-like\nstars are at odds with observations in many respects: They show a surplus of\nenergy in the kinetic power spectrum at large scales, anti-solar differential\nrotation profiles, with accelerated poles and a slow equator, for the solar\nrotation rate, and a transition from axi- to non-axisymmetric dynamos at a much\nlower rotation rate than what is observed. Even though the simulations\nreproduce the observed active longitudes in fast rotators, their motion in the\nrotational frame (the so-called azimuthal dynamo wave, ADW) is retrograde, in\ncontrast to the prevalent prograde motion in observations. Aims. We study the\neffect of a more realistic treatment of heat conductivity in alleviating the\ndiscrepancies between observations and simulations. Methods. We use\nphysically-motivated heat conduction, by applying Kramers opacity law, on a\nsemi-global spherical setup describing convective envelopes of solar-like\nstars, instead of a prescribed heat conduction profile from mixing-length\narguments. Results. We find that some aspects of the results now better\ncorrespond to observations: The axi- to non-axisymmetric transition point is\nshifted towards higher rotation rates. We also find a change in the propagation\ndirection of ADWs so that also prograde waves are now found.

To this end, we propose AdaDeep, a usage-driven, automated DNN\ncompression framework for systematically exploring the desired trade-off\nbetween performance and resource constraints, from a holistic system level.\nSpecifically, in a layer-wise manner, AdaDeep automatically selects the most\nsuitable combination of compression techniques and the corresponding\ncompression hyperparameters for a given DNN. Thorough evaluations on six\ndatasets and across twelve devices demonstrate that AdaDeep can achieve up to\n$18.6\\times$ latency reduction, $9.8\\times$ energy-efficiency improvement, and\n$37.3\\times$ storage reduction in DNNs while incurring negligible accuracy\nloss.

In this method, a reference pose is measured before each\nmeasurement of any particular pose. The measurements of reference pose are used\nto estimate thermal deflection of hexapod's legs. This is in turn used to\nestimate and correct the resulting pose error at the particular pose to be\nmeasured. The advantage of using the proposed method is demonstrated\nexperimentally by means of pose measurements of a high-precision hexapod using\na CMM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jun 2020 10:07:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-09"}

Even though FNNOMP is a\ngood approach when working on libraries of small size, the operational time of\nthe algorithm grows significantly when the size of the library is large.

The formal theory amounts to a hierarchy of\ninfinitely many coupled integro-differential equations, which may be\napproximated using a suitable finite-order closure relation. Although previous\nstudies have suggested that finite-order GMCT leads to well-defined solutions,\nand that the hierarchy converges as the closure level increases, no rigorous\nand general result in this direction is known. Here we unambiguously establish\nthe existence and uniqueness of solutions to generic, schematic GMCT\nhierarchies that are closed at arbitrary order. We consider two types of\ncommonly invoked closure approximations, namely mean-field and exponential\nclosures. We also distinguish explicitly between overdamped and underdamped\nglassy dynamics, corresponding to hierarchies of first-order and second-order\nintegro-differential equations, respectively. We find that truncated GMCT\nhierarchies closed under an exponential closure conform to previously developed\nmathematical theories, such that the existence of a unique solution can be\nreadily inferred. Self-consistent mean-field closures, however, of which the\nwell-known standard-MCT closure approximation is a special case, warrant\nadditional arguments for mathematical rigour. We demonstrate that the existence\nof a priori bounds on the solution is sufficient to also prove that unique\nsolutions exist for such self-consistent hierarchies. To complete our analysis,\nwe present simple arguments to show that these a priori bounds must exist,\nmotivated by the physical interpretation of the GMCT solutions as density\ncorrelation functions. Overall, our work contributes to the theoretical\njustification of GMCT for studies of the glass transition, placing GMCT on a\nfirmer mathematical footing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jun 2020 11:11:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 2020 20:10:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-26"}

Of them,\nmany are binary systems with the two components showing drastically different\nmolecular spectra. Two obvious questions arise. Why are hot corinos so\ndifficult to find and why do their binary components seem chemically different?\nThe answer to both questions could be a high dust opacity that would hide the\nmolecular lines. To test this hypothesis, we observed methanol lines at\ncentimeter wavelengths, where dust opacity is negligible, using the Very Large\nArray interferometer. We targeted the NGC 1333 IRAS 4A binary system, for which\none of the two components, 4A1, has a spectrum deprived of iCOMs lines when\nobserved at millimeter wavelengths, while the other component, 4A2, is very\nrich in iCOMs. We found that centimeter methanol lines are similarly bright\ntoward 4A1 and 4A2. Their non-LTE analysis indicates gas density and\ntemperature ($\\geq2\\times10^6$ cm$^{-3}$ and 100--190 K), methanol column\ndensity ($\\sim10^{19}$ cm$^{-2}$) and extent ($\\sim$35 au in radius) similar in\n4A1 and 4A2, proving that both are hot corinos. Furthermore, the comparison\nwith previous methanol line millimeter observations allows us to estimate the\noptical depth of the dust in front of 4A1 and 4A2, respectively. The obtained\nvalues explain the absence of iCOMs line emission toward 4A1 at millimeter\nwavelengths and indicate that the abundances toward 4A2 are underestimated by\n$\\sim$30\\%. Therefore, centimeter observations are crucial for the correct\nstudy of hot corinos, their census, and their molecular abundances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jun 2020 11:25:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-09"}

While\nconvolutional and fully connected operations have been widely studied in the\nliterature, the design of pooling operations that handle action recognition,\nwith different sources of temporal granularity in action categories, has\ncomparatively received less attention, and existing solutions rely mainly on\nmax or averaging operations. The latter are clearly powerless to fully exhibit\nthe actual temporal granularity of action categories and thereby constitute a\nbottleneck in classification performances. In this paper, we introduce a novel\nhierarchical pooling design that captures different levels of temporal\ngranularity in action recognition. Our design principle is coarse-to-fine and\nachieved using a tree-structured network; as we traverse this network top-down,\npooling operations are getting less invariant but timely more resolute and well\nlocalized. Learning the combination of operations in this network -- which best\nfits a given ground-truth -- is obtained by solving a constrained minimization\nproblem whose solution corresponds to the distribution of weights that capture\nthe contribution of each level (and thereby temporal granularity) in the global\nhierarchical pooling process. Besides being principled and well grounded, the\nproposed hierarchical pooling is also video-length and resolution agnostic.\nExtensive experiments conducted on the challenging UCF-101, HMDB-51 and\nJHMDB-21 databases corroborate all these statements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jun 2020 11:37:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-09"}

It has become evident that one-zone synchrotron self-Compton models\nare not always adequate for very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray emitting blazars.\nWhile two-component models are performing better, they are difficult to\nconstrain due to the large number of free parameters. Aims. In this work, we\nmake a first attempt to take into account the observational constraints from\nVery Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) data, long-term light curves (radio,\noptical, and X-rays) and optical polarisation to limit the parameter space for\na two-component model and test if it can still reproduce the observed spectral\nenergy distribution (SED) of the blazars. Methods. We selected five TeV BL Lac\nobjects based on the availability of VHE gamma-ray and optical polarisation\ndata. We collected constraints for the jet parameters from VLBI observations.\nWe evaluated the contributions of the two components to the optical flux by\nmeans of decomposition of long-term radio and optical light curves as well as\nmodeling of the optical polarisation variability of the objects. We selected\neight epochs for these five objects, based on the variability observed at VHE\ngamma rays, for which we constructed the SEDs that we then modeled with a\ntwo-component model. Results. We found parameter sets which can reproduce the\nbroadband SED of the sources in the framework of two-component models\nconsidering all available observational constraints from VLBI observations.\nMoreover, the constraints obtained from the long-term behavior of the sources\nin the lower energy bands could be used to determine the region where the\nemission in each band originates. Finally, we attempted to use optical\npolarisation data to shed new light on the behavior of the two components in\nthe optical band. Our observationally constrained two zone model allows\nexplanation of the entire SED from radio to VHE with two co-located emission\nregions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jun 2020 11:51:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-02"}

In this paper, we propose FastSpeech 2,\nwhich addresses the issues in FastSpeech and better solves the one-to-many\nmapping problem in TTS by 1) directly training the model with ground-truth\ntarget instead of the simplified output from teacher, and 2) introducing more\nvariation information of speech (e.g., pitch, energy and more accurate\nduration) as conditional inputs. Specifically, we extract duration, pitch and\nenergy from speech waveform and directly take them as conditional inputs in\ntraining and use predicted values in inference. We further design FastSpeech\n2s, which is the first attempt to directly generate speech waveform from text\nin parallel, enjoying the benefit of fully end-to-end inference. Experimental\nresults show that 1) FastSpeech 2 achieves a 3x training speed-up over\nFastSpeech, and FastSpeech 2s enjoys even faster inference speed; 2) FastSpeech\n2 and 2s outperform FastSpeech in voice quality, and FastSpeech 2 can even\nsurpass autoregressive models.

Because of the nature of a deep generative model, the\ngenerated material distributions are diverse and inherit features of the\ntraining data, that is, the elite material distributions.

However, as the number of devices becomes\nlarge, the computational accuracy of AirComp would seriously degrade due to the\nvanishing signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). To address this issue, we exploit the\nmassive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) with hybrid beamforming, in order\nto enhance the computational accuracy of AirComp in a cost-effective manner. In\nparticular, we consider the scenario with a large number of multi-antenna\ndevices simultaneously sending data to an access point (AP) equipped with\nmassive antennas for functional computation over the air. Under this setup, we\njointly optimize the transmit digital beamforming at the wireless devices and\nthe receive hybrid beamforming at the AP, with the objective of minimizing the\ncomputational mean-squared error (MSE) subject to the individual transmit power\nconstraints at the wireless devices. To solve the non-convex hybrid beamforming\ndesign optimization problem, we propose an alternating-optimization-based\napproach. In particular, we propose two computationally efficient algorithms to\nhandle the challenging receive analog beamforming problem, by exploiting the\ntechniques of successive convex approximation (SCA) and block coordinate\ndescent (BCD), respectively. It is shown that for the special case with a\nfully-digital receiver at the AP, the achieved MSE of the massive MIMO AirComp\nsystem is inversely proportional to the number of receive antennas.\nFurthermore, numerical results show that the proposed hybrid beamforming design\nsubstantially enhances the computation MSE performance as compared to other\nbenchmark schemes, while the SCA-based algorithm performs closely to the\nperformance upper bound achieved by the fully-digital beamforming.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jun 2020 13:08:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-09"}

Within another 5 galaxies, the\nPAH emission is enhanced around star forming regions only at specific\ngalactocentric radii. In 6 more galaxies, PAH excitation is more strongly\ncorrelated with the evolved stellar populations as traced by 3.6 micron\nemission. The results for the remaining 3 galaxies were ambiguous.

The aim of the study is to understand\nthe relationship between the observed CME and the two distinct shock wave\nsignatures. Methods: The multi-wavelength study of the eruptive event\n(CME/flare) was complemented with radio triangulation of the associated radio\nemission and modelling of the CME and the shock wave employing MHD simulations.\nResults: We found that, although temporal association between the type II\nbursts and the CME is good, the low-frequency type II(LF-type II) burst occurs\nsignificantly higher in the corona than the CME and its relationship to the CME\nis not straightforward. The analysis of the EIT wave (coronal bright front)\nshows the fastest wave component to be in the southeast quadrant of the Sun.\nThis is also the quadrant in which the source positions of the LF-type II were\nfound to be located, probably resulting from the interaction between the shock\nwave and a streamer.

In turn, this has given rise to adversarial examples, carefully\nperturbed input samples aimed to mislead detection at test time, which have\nbeen applied to attack spam and malware classification, and more recently to\nattack image classification. Consequently, an abundance of research has been\ndevoted to designing machine learning methods that are robust to adversarial\nexamples. Unfortunately, there are desiderata besides robustness that a secure\nand safe machine learning model must satisfy, such as fairness and privacy.\nRecent work by Song et al. (2019) has shown, empirically, that there exists a\ntrade-off between robust and private machine learning models. Models designed\nto be robust to adversarial examples often overfit on training data to a larger\nextent than standard (non-robust) models. If a dataset contains private\ninformation, then any statistical test that separates training and test data by\nobserving a model's outputs can represent a privacy breach, and if a model\noverfits on training data, these statistical tests become easier.\n  In this work, we identify settings where standard models will overfit to a\nlarger extent in comparison to robust models, and as empirically observed in\nprevious works, settings where the opposite behavior occurs. Thus, it is not\nnecessarily the case that privacy must be sacrificed to achieve robustness. The\ndegree of overfitting naturally depends on the amount of data available for\ntraining. We go on to characterize how the training set size factors into the\nprivacy risks exposed by training a robust model on a simple Gaussian data\ntask, and show empirically that our findings hold on image classification\nbenchmark datasets, such as CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jun 2020 14:20:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 8 Jan 2022 02:11:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-11"}

In order to overcome security concerns associated\nwith the outsorcing of IC fabrication, the Split Manufacturing technique was\nproposed. In Split Manufacturing, the Front End of Line (FEOL) layers\n(transistors and lower metal layers) are fabricated at an untrusted high-end\nfoundry, while the Back End of Line (BEOL) layers (higher metal layers) are\nmanufactured at a trusted low-end foundry. This approach hides the BEOL\nconnections from the untrusted foundry, thus preventing overproduction and\npiracy threats. However, many works demonstrate that BEOL connections can be\nderived by exploiting layout characteristics that are introduced by heuristics\nemployed in typical floorplanning, placement, and routing algorithms.

A possible remedy is more advanced conditional PFI approaches\nthat enable the assessment of feature importance conditional on all other\nfeatures. Due to this shift in perspective and in order to enable correct\ninterpretations, it is therefore important that the conditioning is transparent\nand humanly comprehensible. In this paper, we propose a new sampling mechanism\nfor the conditional distribution based on permutations in conditional\nsubgroups. As these subgroups are constructed using decision trees\n(transformation trees), the conditioning becomes inherently interpretable. This\nnot only provides a simple and effective estimator of conditional PFI, but also\nlocal PFI estimates within the subgroups. In addition, we apply the conditional\nsubgroups approach to partial dependence plots (PDP), a popular method for\ndescribing feature effects that can also suffer from extrapolation when\nfeatures are dependent and interactions are present in the model.

In this work, we proposed a new architecture to\naddress these issues that is more efficient and is capable of incorporating\ndifferent edge type information. It generates node representations by attending\nto neighbours sampled from weighted multi-step transition probabilities. We\nconduct experiments on both transductive and inductive settings. Experiments\nachieved comparable or better results on several graph benchmarks, including\nthe Cora, Citeseer, Pubmed, PPI, Twitter, and YouTube datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jun 2020 14:36:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-09"}

Although high-level\nRESs penetration reduces negative environmental impact compared to conventional\nfossil fuel based energy generation, control issues become more complex as well\nas total inertia to the system is significantly decreased due to removal of\nconventional synchronous generators. Some other technical issues, high\nuncertainties, low fault ride through capability, high fault current, low\ngeneration reserve, and low power quality, arise due to RESs integration.\nRenewable energy like solar and wind are highly uncertain due to intermittent\nnature of wind and sunlight.

Tree-based data structures are widely used to build\npersistent data stores, and indeed they lie at the backbone of many of the data\nmanagement systems used in production and research today. In this paper, we\nshow that benchmarking a persistent tree-based data structure on an SSD is a\ncomplex process, which may easily incur subtle pitfalls that can lead to an\ninaccurate performance assessment. At a high-level, these pitfalls stem from\nthe interaction of complex software running on complex hardware. On one hand,\ntree structures implement internal operations that have nontrivial effects on\nperformance. On the other hand, SSDs employ firmware logic to deal with the\nidiosyncrasies of the underlying flash memory, which are well known to lead to\ncomplex performance dynamics. We identify seven benchmarking pitfalls using\nRocksDB and WiredTiger, two widespread implementations of an LSM-Tree and a\nB+Tree, respectively. We show that such pitfalls can lead to incorrect\nmeasurements of key performance indicators, hinder the reproducibility and the\nrepresentativeness of the results, and lead to suboptimal deployments in\nproduction environments.

Rather than base the dual domain on (local)\nmartingale deflators, we use a class of supermartingale deflators such that\ndeflated wealth plus cumulative deflated consumption is a supermartingale for\nall admissible consumption plans. This yields a strong duality, because the\nenlarged dual domain of processes dominated by deflators is naturally closed,\nwithout invoking its closure. In this way we automatically reach the bipolar of\nthe set of deflators. We complete this picture by proving that the set of\nprocesses dominated by local martingale deflators is dense in our dual domain,\nconfirming that we have identified the natural dual space. In addition to the\noptimal consumption and deflator, we characterise the optimal wealth process.\nAt the optimum, deflated wealth is a supermartingale and a potential, while\ndeflated wealth plus cumulative deflated consumption is a uniformly integrable\nmartingale. This is the natural generalisation of the corresponding feature in\nthe terminal wealth problem, where deflated wealth at the optimum is a\nuniformly integrable martingale. We use no constructions involving equivalent\nlocal martingale measures. This is natural, given that such measures typically\ndo not exist over the infinite horizon and that we are working under NUPBR,\nwhich does not require their existence. The structure of the duality proof\nreveals an interesting feature compared with the terminal wealth problem.\nThere, the dual domain is $L^{1}$-bounded, but here the primal domain has this\nproperty, and hence many steps in the duality proof show a marked reversal of\nroles for the primal and dual domains, compared with the proofs of Kramkov and\nSchachermayer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jun 2020 15:37:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Jun 2020 11:12:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 25 Jul 2020 20:50:31 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2021 12:50:25 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 8 Sep 2021 14:01:00 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Wed, 10 Nov 2021 19:46:37 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Mon, 20 Dec 2021 16:23:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-21"}

Such situations arise, e.g., when\nnonlinear dynamics produce a non-Gaussian forecast but a tight Gaussian\nlikelihood leads to a nearly-Gaussian posterior. The hybrid filter starts by\nfactoring the likelihood. First the particle filter assimilates the\nobservations with one factor of the likelihood to produce an intermediate prior\nthat is close to Gaussian, and then the ensemble Kalman filter completes the\nassimilation with the remaining factor.

Of interest in this study is the assessment of\nradiative processes at building walls in terms of emissivity (i.e. is the ratio\nof the thermal radiation from a surface to the radiation from an ideal black\nsurface at the same temperature), shape factors (i.e. the proportion of the\nradiation which leaves the surface of a building and strikes toward the surface\nof another building) and their relation to the Richardson number.

In particular, we explore the impact of epitaxial compressive strain\nthat experience (Nd,Sr)NiO$_2$ films on the electronic properties, magnetic\ncorrelations, and exchange couplings. Our results reveal the crucial importance\nof orbital-dependent correlation effects in the Ni $3d$ shell of Sr-doped\nNdNiO$_2$. Upon doping with Sr, it undergoes a Lifshitz transition which is\naccompanied by a reconstruction of magnetic correlations: For Sr $x<0.2$\n(Nd,Sr)NiO$_2$ adopts the N\\'eel $(111)$ antiferromagnetic (AFM) order, while\nfor $x>0.2$ the $C$-type $(110)$ AFM sets in the unstrained (Nd,Sr)NiO$_2$,\nwith a highly frustrated region at $x \\simeq 0.2$, all within DFT+DMFT at\n$T=290$ K. Our results for the N\\'eel AFM at Sr $x=0$ suggest that AFM\nNdNiO$_2$ appears at the verge of a Mott-Hubbard transition, providing a\nplausible explanation for the experimentally observed weakly insulating\nbehavior of NdNiO$_2$ for Sr $x<0.1$. We observe that the Lifshitz transition\nmakes a change of the band structure character from electron- to hole-like with\nSr $x$, in agreement with recent experiments. Our results for magnetic\ncouplings demonstrate an unanticipated frustration of the Ni $3d$ magnetic\nmoments, which suppresses magnetic order near Sr $x=0.2$. We find that the\neffect of frustration is maximal for Sr doping $x \\simeq 0.1-0.2$ that nearly\ncorresponds to the experimentally observed doping value. We conclude that the\nin-plane strain adjusts a bandwidth of the Ni $x^2-y^2$ band, i.e., controls\nthe effect of electron correlations in the Ni $x^2-y^2$ orbitals. The\nelectronic properties of (Nd,Sr)NiO$_2$ reveal an anomalous sensitivity upon a\nchange of the crystal structure parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jun 2020 06:33:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Sep 2020 21:08:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-16"}

In this\npaper, I consider the possibility that some fundamental laws are vague. I call\nthis phenomenon 'fundamental nomic vagueness.' I characterize fundamental nomic\nvagueness as the existence of borderline lawful worlds and the presence of\nseveral other accompanying features. Under certain assumptions, such vagueness\nprevents the fundamental physical theory from being completely expressible in\nthe mathematical language. Moreover, I suggest that such vagueness can be\nregarded as 'vagueness in the world.' For a case study, we turn to the Past\nHypothesis, a postulate that (partially) explains the direction of time in our\nworld. We have reasons to take it seriously as a candidate fundamental law of\nnature. Yet it is vague: it admits borderline (nomologically) possible worlds.\nAn exact version would lead to an untraceable arbitrariness absent in any other\nfundamental laws. However, the dilemma between fundamental nomic vagueness and\nuntraceable arbitrariness is dissolved in a new quantum theory of time's arrow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jun 2020 01:41:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Feb 2021 04:12:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-08"}

Three canonical configurations at different Reynolds numbers are\nconsidered: (a) an isolated circular cylinder; (b) side-by-side circular\ncylinders and (c) a near-wall circular cylinder. The objective is to\ninvestigate the behavior of a HSP subjecting to imbalanced shear-layer\ninteraction and different Reynolds numbers. It is found that a HSP evolves\nalong the shear-layer interfaces and imposes adverse pressure gradients, which\npotentially deteriorates near-wake stability. The inherent characteristics of a\nHSP is linked with net positive fluid-fluid divergence and fluid three\ndimensionality. A vorticity-free stagnant zone is formed around a HSP, which\ncut the kinetic energy supply of shear layers in wake, project\nthird-dimensional fluid fluxes and develops three-dimensional streamwise\nbraids. These findings are confirmed and explained via the quantification of\nthe fluid-flux divergence, the hydrodynamic responses of cylinder(s) and the\nsecondary enstrophy. The primary focus in this article is to reveal the subtle\nanalytical relationships between HSP, divergence of pressure force/fluid flux,\nfluid three dimensionality and imbalanced shear-layer interaction.

Such a service requires a\nuser to send data, e.g. image, voice and video, to the provider, which presents\na serious challenge to user privacy. To address this, prior works either\nobfuscate the data, e.g. add noise and remove identity information, or send\nrepresentations extracted from the data, e.g. anonymized features. They\nstruggle to balance between the service utility and data privacy because\nobfuscated data reduces utility and extracted representation may still reveal\nsensitive information.\n  This work departs from prior works in methodology: we leverage adversarial\nlearning to a better balance between privacy and utility. We design a\n\\textit{representation encoder} that generates the feature representations to\noptimize against the privacy disclosure risk of sensitive information (a\nmeasure of privacy) by the \\textit{privacy adversaries}, and concurrently\noptimize with the task inference accuracy (a measure of utility) by the\n\\textit{utility discriminator}. The result is the privacy adversarial network\n(\\systemname), a novel deep model with the new training algorithm, that can\nautomatically learn representations from the raw data.\n  Intuitively, PAN adversarially forces the extracted representations to only\nconvey the information required by the target task. Surprisingly, this\nconstitutes an implicit regularization that actually improves task accuracy. As\na result, PAN achieves better utility and better privacy at the same time! We\nreport extensive experiments on six popular datasets and demonstrate the\nsuperiority of \\systemname compared with alternative methods reported in prior\nwork.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jun 2020 09:42:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-12"}
