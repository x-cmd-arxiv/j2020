In models\ninvolving kinetic mixing where the dark photon acts as the mediator, these\nconstraints are easily satisfied and the appropriate DM relic density\nachievable if the DM is, e.g., a complex scalar, where $p$-wave annihilation\noccurs, or is the lighter component of a split pseudo-Dirac state where\nco-annihilation dominates. In both of these cases, although higher order in the\ndark gauge coupling, $g_D$, the corresponding annihilation processes including\ndark photon initial state radiation (ISR) will be dominantly $s$-wave with\nessentially temperature independent cross sections. The rates for these dark\nISR associated processes, though not yielding cross sections large enough to\ncontribute to the relic density, can still run into possible conflicts with the\nbounds arising from the CMB. In this paper we perform a preliminary study of\nthe present and potential future constraints that the CMB imposes on the\nparameter spaces for both of these scenarios due to the existence of this dark\nISR. Further analyses of the effects of dark ISR in DM annihilation is clearly\nwarranted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jun 2020 16:01:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2020 15:41:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2020 16:31:03 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 15:18:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}

Unlike previous methods that separately search the neural\narchitecture, pruning policy, and quantization policy, we optimize them in a\njoint manner. To deal with the larger design space it brings, a promising\napproach is to train a quantization-aware accuracy predictor to quickly get the\naccuracy of the quantized model and feed it to the search engine to select the\nbest fit. However, training this quantization-aware accuracy predictor requires\ncollecting a large number of quantized <model, accuracy> pairs, which involves\nquantization-aware finetuning and thus is highly time-consuming. To tackle this\nchallenge, we propose to transfer the knowledge from a full-precision (i.e.,\nfp32) accuracy predictor to the quantization-aware (i.e., int8) accuracy\npredictor, which greatly improves the sample efficiency. Besides, collecting\nthe dataset for the fp32 accuracy predictor only requires to evaluate neural\nnetworks without any training cost by sampling from a pretrained once-for-all\nnetwork, which is highly efficient. Extensive experiments on ImageNet\ndemonstrate the benefits of our joint optimization approach. With the same\naccuracy, APQ reduces the latency/energy by 2x/1.3x over MobileNetV2+HAQ.\nCompared to the separate optimization approach (ProxylessNAS+AMC+HAQ), APQ\nachieves 2.3% higher ImageNet accuracy while reducing orders of magnitude GPU\nhours and CO2 emission, pushing the frontier for green AI that is\nenvironmental-friendly.

The operation of such second layer approaches relies on the ability\nof participants to turn to the blockchain to claim funds at any time, which is\nassumed to happen rarely. One of the risks that was identified early on is that\nof a wide systemic attack on the protocol, in which an attacker triggers the\nclosure of many Lightning channels at once. The resulting high volume of\ntransactions in the blockchain will not allow for the proper settlement of all\ndebts, and attackers may get away with stealing some funds. This paper explores\nthe details of such an attack and evaluates its cost and overall impact on\nBitcoin and the Lightning Network. Specifically, we show that an attacker is\nable to simultaneously cause victim nodes to overload the Bitcoin blockchain\nwith requests and to steal funds that were locked in channels. We go on to\nexamine the interaction of Lightning nodes with the fee estimation mechanism\nand show that the attacker can continuously lower the fee of transactions that\nwill later be used by the victim in its attempts to recover funds - eventually\nreaching a state in which only low fractions of the block are available for\nlightning transactions. Our attack is made easier even further as the Lightning\nprotocol allows the attacker to increase the fee offered by his own\ntransactions. We continue to empirically show that the vast majority of nodes\nagree to channel opening requests from unknown sources and are therefore\nsusceptible to this attack. We highlight differences between various\nimplementations of the Lightning Network protocol and review the susceptibility\nof each one to the attack.

We find that,\nunder experimentally accessible conditions, molecular systems in microcavities\nmay have nonlinear phenomena significantly intensified due to the high quality\nof polariton resonances and the enhanced microcavity electromagnetic energy\ndensity relative to free space. Particularly large enhancement of multiphoton\nabsorption happens when multipolariton states are resonant with bare molecule\nmultiphoton transitions.

High-precision chemical abundances are crucial to improving our\nunderstanding of the chemodynamical properties present in the Galaxy. However,\nderiving precise abundance estimations in the metal-rich disc ([M/H] > 0 dex)\nis still challenging. The aim of this paper is to analyse different error\nsources affecting magnesium abundance estimations from optical spectra of\nmetal-rich stars. We derived Mg abundances for 87522 high-resolution spectra of\n2210 solar neighbourhood stars from the AMBRE Project. For this purpose, the\nGAUGUIN automated abundance estimation procedure was employed. The\nnormalisation procedure has a strong impact on the derived abundances, with a\nclear dependence on the stellar type and the line intensity. For non-saturated\nlines, the optimal wavelength domain for the local continuum placement should\nbe evaluated using a goodness-of-fit criterion, allowing mask-size dependence\nwith the spectral type. Moreover, for strong saturated lines, applying a narrow\nnormalisation window reduces the parameter-dependent biases of the abundance\nestimate, increasing the line-to-line abundance precision. In addition, working\nat large spectral resolutions always leads to better results than at lower\nones. The resulting improvement in the abundance precision makes it possible to\nobserve both a clear thin-thick disc chemical distinction and a decreasing\ntrend in the magnesium abundance even at supersolar metallicities. In the era\nof precise kinematical and dynamical data, optimising the normalisation\nprocedures implemented for large spectroscopic stellar surveys would provide a\nsignificant improvement to our understanding of the chemodynamical patterns of\nGalactic populations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jun 2020 16:59:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-29"}

In the presence of these\nderivative couplings, the density of produced particles for the adiabatic\nregime in the de Sitter phase (which mimics inflation) is constant in time and\ndecays with the inverse effective mass (which in turn depends on the coupling\nto the curvature scalar).

This is closely related to the local graph clustering or community\ndetection problem of finding a cluster or community of nodes around a given\nseed. For this problem, we propose a novel generalization of random walk,\ndiffusion, or smooth function methods in the literature to a convex p-norm cut\nfunction. The need for our p-norm methods is that, in our study of existing\nmethods, we find those principled methods based on eigenvector, spectral,\nrandom walk, or linear system often have difficulty capturing the correct\nboundary of a target label or target cluster. In contrast, 1-norm or\nmaxflow-mincut based methods capture the boundary, but cannot grow from small\nseed set; hybrid procedures that use both have many hard to set parameters. In\nthis paper, we propose a generalization of the objective function behind these\nmethods involving p-norms. To solve the p-norm cut problem we give a strongly\nlocal algorithm -- one whose runtime depends on the size of the output rather\nthan the size of the graph. Our method can be thought as a nonlinear\ngeneralization of the Anderson-Chung-Lang push procedure to approximate a\npersonalized PageRank vector efficiently. Our procedure is general and can\nsolve other types of nonlinear objective functions, such as p-norm variants of\nHuber losses. We provide a theoretical analysis of finding planted target\nclusters with our method and show that the p-norm cut functions improve on the\nstandard Cheeger inequalities for random walk and spectral methods. Finally, we\ndemonstrate the speed and accuracy of our new method in synthetic and real\nworld datasets.

It reacts with Na to form Na$_3$Bi\nwhich is a prototypical Dirac semimetal with a nontrivial electronic structure.\nDensity-functional-theory based first-principles calculations are playing a key\nrole in understanding the fascinating electronic structure of Na$_3$Bi and\nother topological materials. In particular, the\nstrongly-constrained-and-appropriately-normed (SCAN)\nmeta-generalized-gradient-approximation (meta-GGA) has shown significant\nimprovement over the widely used generalized-gradient-approximation (GGA)\nscheme in capturing energetic, structural, and electronic properties of many\nclasses of materials. Here, we discuss the electronic structure of Na$_3$Bi\nwithin the SCAN framework and show that the resulting Fermi velocities and {\\it\ns}-band shift around the $\\Gamma$ point are in better agreement with\nexperiments than the corresponding GGA predictions. SCAN yields a purely\nspin-orbit-coupling (SOC) driven Dirac semimetal state in Na$_3$Bi in contrast\nwith the earlier GGA results.

A typical regression approach in the top-down setting of this\nproblem would first detect all humans and then reconstruct each one of them\nindependently. However, this type of prediction suffers from incoherent\nresults, e.g., interpenetration and inconsistent depth ordering between the\npeople in the scene. Our goal is to train a single network that learns to avoid\nthese problems and generate a coherent 3D reconstruction of all the humans in\nthe scene. To this end, a key design choice is the incorporation of the SMPL\nparametric body model in our top-down framework, which enables the use of two\nnovel losses. First, a distance field-based collision loss penalizes\ninterpenetration among the reconstructed people. Second, a depth ordering-aware\nloss reasons about occlusions and promotes a depth ordering of people that\nleads to a rendering which is consistent with the annotated instance\nsegmentation. This provides depth supervision signals to the network, even if\nthe image has no explicit 3D annotations. The experiments show that our\napproach outperforms previous methods on standard 3D pose benchmarks, while our\nproposed losses enable more coherent reconstruction in natural images.

Because\nthey are optically thin at all wavelengths, we have direct access to the\nproperties of dust grains. One very promising technique to study them is to\nmeasure their phase function. Disks that are highly inclined are promising\ntargets as a wider range of scattering angles can be probed. The phase function\nis usually either inferred by comparing the observations to synthetic disk\nmodels assuming a parametrized phase function, or estimating it from the\nsurface brightness of the disk. We argue here that the latter approach can be\nbiased due to projection effects leading to an increase in column density along\nthe major axis of a non flat disk. We present a novel approach to account for\nthose column density effects. The method remains model dependent, as one still\nrequires a disk model to estimate the density variations as a function of the\nscattering angle. This method allows us however to estimate the shape of the\nphase function without having to invoke any parametrized form. We apply our\nmethod to SPHERE/ZIMPOL observations of HR\\,4796 and highlight the differences\nwith previous measurements. Our modelling results suggest that the disk is not\nvertically flat at optical wavelengths. We discuss some of the caveats of the\napproach, mostly that our method remains blind to real local increase of the\ndust density, and that it cannot yet be readily applied to angular differential\nimaging observations. Similarly to previous studies on HR\\,4796, we still\ncannot reconcile the full picture using a given scattering theory to explain\nthe shape of the phase function, a long lasting problem for debris disks.\nNonetheless, we argue that similar effects as the ones highlighted in this\nstudy can also bias the determination of the phase function in total intensity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jun 2020 17:59:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-05"}

The observed Fe III emission is best accounted for by dense\n($n_H=10^{14}$ cm$^{-3}$) gas which is microturbulent, leading to smaller line\noptical depths and fluorescent excitation. Such high density gas appears to be\npresent in the central regions of the majority of luminous quasars. Using our\nfavoured model, we present theoretical predictions for the relative strengths\nof the Fe III UV34 $\\lambda\\lambda$1895,1914,1926 multiplet.

An exploration of model halos\nbuilt from accreted dwarfs Bullock & Johnston (2005) suggests that stellar\ndebris from massive, recent accretion events can produce much more power in the\nvelocity angular power spectra than the perturbation from the LMC-induced wake.\nWe therefore consider two models for the Sagittarius (Sgr) stream -- the most\nrecent, massive accretion event in the MW apart from the LMC -- and find that\nthe angular power on large scales is generally dominated by the LMC-induced\nwake, even when Sgr is included.

In these sources, photomeson\nproduction can be efficient, producing a large amount of secondary particles,\nsuch as charged pions and muons, that decay and produce high-energy neutrinos.\nBefore their decay, secondary particles can experience energy losses and\nacceleration, which can impact high-energy neutrino spectra and thus affect\ntheir detectability. In this work, we focus on the impact of secondary\nacceleration. We consider a one zone model, characterized mainly by a\nvariability timescale $t_{\\rm var}$, a luminosity $L_{\\rm bol}$, a bulk Lorentz\nfactor $\\Gamma$. The mean magnetic field $B$ is deduced from these parameters.\nThe photon field is modeled by a broken power-law. This generic model allows to\nevaluate systematically the maximum energy of high-energy neutrinos in the\nparameter space of explosive transients, and shows that it could be strongly\naffected by secondary acceleration for a large number of source categories. In\norder to determine the impact of secondary acceleration on the high-energy\nneutrino spectrum and in particular on its peak energy and flux, we complement\nthese estimates by several case studies. We show that secondary acceleration\ncan increase the maximum neutrino flux, and produce a secondary peak at the\nmaximum energy in the case of efficient acceleration.

In the\nanalysis of many real-world graphs or networks, betweenness centrality of a\nvertex is used as an indicator for its relative importance in the network. In\nparticular, it is among the most popular tools in social network analysis. In\nrecent years, a growing number of real-world networks is modeled as temporal\ngraphs, where we have a fixed set of vertices and there is a finite discrete\nset of time steps and every edge might be present only at some time steps.\nWhile shortest paths are straightforward to define in static graphs, temporal\npaths can be considered \"optimal\" with respect to many different criteria,\nincluding length, arrival time, and overall travel time (shortest, foremost,\nand fastest paths). This leads to different concepts of temporal betweenness\ncentrality and we provide a systematic study of temporal betweenness variants\nbased on various concepts of optimal temporal paths. Computing the betweenness\ncentrality for vertices in a graph is closely related to counting the number of\noptimal paths between vertex pairs. We show that counting foremost and fastest\npaths is computationally intractable (#P-hard) and hence the computation of the\ncorresponding temporal betweenness values is intractable as well. For shortest\npaths and two selected special cases of foremost paths, we devise\npolynomial-time algorithms for temporal betweenness computation. Moreover, we\nalso explore the distinction between strict (ascending time labels) and\nnon-strict (non-descending time labels) time labels in temporal paths.

Target maximum likelihood estimators (TMLEs) for the\ncausal effect of a community-level static exposure were previously proposed by\nBalzer et al. In this manuscript, we build on this work and present\nidentifiability results and develop two semi-parametric efficient TMLEs for the\nestimation of the causal effect of the single time-point community-level\nstochastic intervention whose assignment mechanism can depend on measured and\nunmeasured environmental factors and its individual-level covariates. The first\ncommunity-level TMLE is developed under a general hierarchical non-parametric\nstructural equation model, which can incorporate pooled individual-level\nregressions for estimating the outcome mechanism. The second individual-level\nTMLE is developed under a restricted hierarchical model in which the additional\nassumption of no covariate interference within communities holds. The proposed\nTMLEs have several crucial advantages. First, both TMLEs can make use of\nindividual level data in the hierarchical setting, and potentially reduce\nfinite sample bias and improve estimator efficiency. Second, the stochastic\nintervention framework provides a natural way for defining and estimating\ncasual effects where the exposure variables are continuous or discrete with\nmultiple levels, or even cannot be directly intervened on.

Among the applications of these results, we show: 1) if $G$ is a\nfinitely generated branch group, the $G$-action on $\\partial T$ has the\nsmallest possible orbital growth among all faithful $G$-actions; 2) if $G$ is a\nfinitely generated branch group, then every embedding from $G$ into a group of\nhomeomorphisms of strongly bounded type (e.g. a bounded automaton group) must\nbe spatially realized; 3) if $G$ is a finitely generated weakly branch group,\nthen $G$ does not embed into the group IET of interval exchange\ntransformations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jun 2020 18:24:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2020 09:56:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-09"}

To stabilize a high-frequency bus\nline, many holding strategies have been proposed. Among these strategies, some\nneed to take oversimplified assumptions to simplify the formulation of a real\nbus line; some may choose a myopic holding time because they take into account\nonly the local and currently available headway information. To overcome the\nabove shortcomings, we proposed an adaptive holding strategy which continuously\nreduces the deviations of the instantaneous headways from the Dynamic Target\nHeadway -DTH. By using DTH, the new strategy can make use of the global headway\ninformation to determine a proper holding time. To fully estimate the influence\nof a holding time on the operation of a bus line in a relative long time\nperiod, we introduced the multi-stage looking-ahead mechanism into our new\nstrategy. A detailed bus line simulation system was used to realize the above\nmechanism and to describe all kinds of complex components of a bus line.

Although many control strategies, such as the static and dynamic\nholding strategies, have been proposed to solve the above problems, many of\nthem take on some oversimplified assumptions about the real bus line operation.\nSo it is hard for them to continuously adapt to the evolving complex system. In\nview of this dynamic setting, we present an adaptive holding method which\ncombines the classic approximate dynamic programming (ADP) with the multi-stage\nlook-ahead mechanism. The holding time, that is the only control means used in\nthis study, will be determined by estimating its impact on the operation\nstability of the bus line system in the remained observation period. The\nmulti-stage look-ahead mechanism introduced into the classic Q-learning\nalgorithm of the ADP model makes the algorithm get through its earlier unstable\nphase more quickly and easily. During the implementation of the new holding\napproach, the past experiences of holding operations can be cumulated\neffectively into an artificial neural network used to approximate the\nunavailable Q-factor. The use of a detailed simulation system in the new\napproach makes it possible to take into accounts most of the possible causes of\ninstability.

The task is to assign orders to\nproduction periods such that the load in each period and on each production\nresource is balanced, capacity limits are not exceeded and the orders'\npriorities are taken into account. Production Leveling is an important\nintermediate step between long-term planning and the final scheduling of orders\nwithin a production period, as it is responsible for selecting good subsets of\norders to be scheduled within each period.\n  A formal model of the problem is proposed and NP-hardness is shown by\nreduction from Bin Backing. As an exact method for solving moderately sized\ninstances we introduce a MIP formulation. For solving large problem instances,\nmetaheuristic local search is investigated. A greedy heuristic and two\nneighborhood structures for local search are proposed, in order to apply them\nusing Variable Neighborhood Descent and Simulated Annealing. Regarding exact\ntechniques, the main question of research is, up to which size instances are\nsolvable within a fixed amount of time. For the metaheuristic approaches the\naim is to show that they produce near-optimal solutions for smaller instances,\nbut also scale well to very large instances.\n  A set of realistic problem instances from an industrial partner is\ncontributed to the literature, as well as random instance generators.

We argue that\nthe~fixed-strategy~definitions of exploitability and $\\epsilon$-Nash equilibria\nare ill-suited to measure an online algorithm's worst-case performance. We thus\nformalize $\\epsilon$-soundness, a concept that connects the worst-case\nperformance of an online algorithm to the performance of an $\\epsilon$-Nash\nequilibrium. As $\\epsilon$-soundness can be difficult to compute in general, we\nintroduce a consistency framework -- a hierarchy that connects an online\nalgorithm's behavior to a Nash equilibrium. These multiple levels of\nconsistency describe in what sense an online algorithm plays \"just like a fixed\nNash equilibrium\". These notions further illustrate the difference between\nperfect and imperfect information settings, as the same consistency guarantees\nhave different worst-case online performance in perfect and imperfect\ninformation games. The definitions of soundness and the consistency hierarchy\nfinally provide appropriate tools to analyze online algorithms in repeated\nimperfect information games.

Its success has been fueled by its attractive\nrobustness and scalability properties, by ease of modeling, and by the limited\nassumptions it needs about the uncertain parameters to yield meaningful\nsolutions. Robust optimization techniques can address both single- and\nmulti-stage decision-making problems involving real-valued and/or binary\ndecisions, and exogenous and/or endogenous uncertain parameters. Many of these\ntechniques apply to problems with either robust (worst-case) or stochastic\n(expectation) objectives and can thus be tailored to the risk preferences of\nthe decision-maker. Robust optimization techniques rely on duality theory\n(potentially augmented with approximations) to transform a semi-infinite\noptimization problem to a finite program of benign complexity (the ``robust\ncounterpart''). While writing down the model for a robust or stochastic\noptimization problem is usually a simple task, obtaining the robust counterpart\nrequires expertise in robust optimization. To date, very few solutions are\navailable that can facilitate the modeling and solution of such problems. This\nhas been a major impediment to their being put to practical use.

The fact that\nthe popular optimistic algorithms do not achieve the asymptotic\ninstance-dependent regret optimality (asymptotic optimality for short) has\nrecently alluded researchers. On the other hand, it is known that one can\nachieve bounded regret (i.e., does not grow indefinitely with $n$) in certain\ninstances. Unfortunately, existing asymptotically optimal algorithms rely on\nforced sampling that introduces an $\\omega(1)$ term w.r.t. the time horizon $n$\nin their regret, failing to adapt to the \"easiness\" of the instance. In this\npaper, we focus on the finite hypothesis case and ask if one can achieve the\nasymptotic optimality while enjoying bounded regret whenever possible. We\nprovide a positive answer by introducing a new algorithm called CRush Optimism\nwith Pessimism (CROP) that eliminates optimistic hypotheses by pulling the\ninformative arms indicated by a pessimistic hypothesis. Our finite-time\nanalysis shows that CROP $(i)$ achieves a constant-factor asymptotic optimality\nand, thanks to the forced-exploration-free design, $(ii)$ adapts to bounded\nregret, and $(iii)$ its regret bound scales not with $K$ but with an effective\nnumber of arms $K_\\psi$ that we introduce.

The streaming hardware architectures generally require implementing\nevery layer as a discrete processing unit, and are suitable for smaller\nsoftware models that could fit in their unfolded versions into\nresource-constrained targets. On the other hand, single computation engines can\nbe scaled to fit into a device to execute CNN models of different sizes and\ncomplexities, however, the achievable performance of one-size-fits-all\nimplementations may vary across CNNs with different workload attributes leading\nto inefficient utilization of hardware resources.

However, how to design effective parallel MCTS algorithms has\nnot been systematically studied and remains poorly understood. In this paper,\nwe seek to lay its first theoretical foundation, by examining the potential\nperformance loss caused by parallelization when achieving a desired speedup. In\nparticular, we discover the necessary conditions of achieving a desirable\nparallelization performance, and highlight two of their practical benefits.\nFirst, by examining whether existing parallel MCTS algorithms satisfy these\nconditions, we identify key design principles that should be inherited by\nfuture algorithms, for example tracking the unobserved samples (used in WU-UCT\n(Liu et al., 2020)). We theoretically establish this essential design\nfacilitates $\\mathcal{O} ( \\ln n + M / \\sqrt{\\ln n} )$ cumulative regret when\nthe maximum tree depth is 2, where $n$ is the number of rollouts and $M$ is the\nnumber of workers. A regret of this form is highly desirable, as compared to\n$\\mathcal{O} ( \\ln n )$ regret incurred by a sequential counterpart, its excess\npart approaches zero as $n$ increases. Second, and more importantly, we\ndemonstrate how the proposed necessary conditions can be adopted to design more\neffective parallel MCTS algorithms. To illustrate this, we propose a new\nparallel MCTS algorithm, called BU-UCT, by following our theoretical\nguidelines. The newly proposed algorithm, albeit preliminary, out-performs four\ncompetitive baselines on 11 out of 15 Atari games. We hope our theoretical\nresults could inspire future work of more effective parallel MCTS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jun 2020 21:36:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 4 Oct 2020 21:13:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-06"}

Product reviews on sites, such as Amazon, represent a valuable data\nsource to understand why someone bought an item and potentially who the item is\nfor. This information can then be used to construct a dynamic user profile. In\nthis paper, we demonstrate utilising reviews to extract temporal information to\ninfer the \\textit{age category preference} of users, and leverage this feature\nto generate time-dependent recommendations. Given the predictable and yet\nshifting nature of age and time, we show that, recommendations generated using\nthis dynamic aspect lead to higher accuracy compared with techniques from state\nof art. Mining temporally related content in reviews can enable the recommender\nto go beyond finding similar items or users to potentially predict a future\nneed of a user.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jun 2020 22:23:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-17"}

This recommended\ntwo-meters distance is mainly based on short-distance contagion, when infected\ndrops are expelled during a speech, coughing, or sneezing and directly hit\nanother person. The dangerous form of airway contamination caused by droplets\nthat remain suspended in the air for several hours has been almost ignored.\nHowever, the theoretical calculations performed in this work, recent\nexperiments, and the accumulated knowledge in this and other epidemics indicate\nthat, because of the airborne transmission, there is no safe distance to the\ncoronavirus, either indoors or in open places. Recent investigations have\nconfirmed not only the presence of the coronavirus in droplets suspended in the\nair but that these viruses remain active for several hours. Furthermore,\nsignificant indirect evidence of this means of transmission is the great\ndifference in contagion between Brazilian regions in the current outbreak.\nWhile the Amazonian states have a contamination rate greater than 20%, in the\nsouthern states of the country this rate is less than 1%, despite high\ntemperatures in the Northern region. Notwithstanding the social and economic\ndifferences between these regions, it seems that the extremely high humidity of\nthe forest air prolongs the survival of the viruses in the drops in the\nexternal environment. Our theoretical calculations explain empirical\nobservations from recent epidemiological studies and strengthen the need to\nuse, not only a mask but also protective glasses throughout the population in\nthe same way that they are mandatory for health professionals. Besides, our\ncalculations show how air conditioning and heating systems can increase\ncontagion. Finally, we suggest measures that could reduce the spread of the\npandemic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jun 2020 23:35:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-17"}

In this work, we focus\non the problem of load forecasting. With strict social distancing restrictions,\npower consumption profiles around the world have shifted both in magnitude and\ndaily patterns. These changes have caused significant difficulties in\nshort-term load forecasting. Typically algorithms use weather, timing\ninformation and previous consumption levels as input variables, yet they cannot\ncapture large and sudden changes in socioeconomic behavior during the pandemic.\nIn this paper, we introduce mobility as a measure of economic activities to\ncomplement existing building blocks of forecasting algorithms. Mobility data\nacts as good proxies for the population-level behaviors during the\nimplementation and subsequent easing of social distancing measures. The major\nchallenge with such dataset is that only limited mobility records are\nassociated with the recent pandemic. To overcome this small data problem, we\ndesign a transfer learning scheme that enables knowledge transfer between\nseveral different geographical regions.

Through simulations\nfor regions in the US and Europe, we show our proposed algorithm can outperform\nconventional forecasting methods by more than three-folds.

Launched in October 1959 on a translunar trajectory with\nlarge semi-major axis and eccentricity, it collided with the Earth in late\nMarch 1960. The short, 6-month dynamical lifetime has often been explained\nthrough an increase in eccentricity due to the Lidov-Kozai effect. However, the\nclassical Lidov-Kozai solution is only valid in the limit of small semi-major\naxis ratio, a condition that is satisfied only for solar (but not for lunar)\nperturbations. We undertook a study of the dynamics of Luna 3 with the aim of\nassessing the principal mechanisms affecting its evolution. We analyze the Luna\n3 trajectory by generating accurate osculating solutions, and by comparing them\nto integrations of singly- and doubly-averaged equations of motion in vectorial\nform. Lunar close encounters, which cannot be reproduced in an averaging\napproach, decisively affect the trajectory and break the doubly-averaged\ndynamics. Solar perturbations induce oscillations of intermediate period that\naffect the geometry of the close encounters and cause the singly-averaged and\nosculating inclinations to change quadrants (the orbital plane ``flips''). We\nfind that the peculiar evolution of Luna 3 can only be explained by taking into\naccount lunar close encounters and intermediate-period terms; such terms are\naveraged out in the Lidov-Kozai solution, which is not adequate to describe\ntranslunar or cislunar trajectories. Understanding the limits of the\nLidov-Kozai solution is of particular significance for the motion of objects in\nthe Earth-Moon environment and of exoplanetary systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jun 2020 23:43:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-21"}

The DDD data strongly suggests a logarithmic\ndependence of flow stress on the plastic shear strain rate on each slip system,\nand, equivalently, an exponential dependence of the plastic shear strain rate\non the resolved shear stress. Hence the proposed generalized Taylor relation\nsubsumes the Orowan relation for plastic flow. The DDD data also calls for a\ncorrection to the Kocks-Mecking model of dislocation multiplication to account\nfor the increase of dislocation density on slip systems with negligible plastic\nshear strain rate.

Many practical applications, such as accident prevention\nand resource pre-allocation, require an extended period for preparation.\nHowever, challenges come as long-term prediction is highly error-sensitive,\nwhich becomes more critical when predicting urban-wise phenomena with\ncomplicated and dynamic spatial-temporal correlation. Specifically, since the\namount of valuable correlation is limited, enormous irrelevant features\nintroduce noises that trigger increased prediction errors. Besides, after each\ntime step, the errors can traverse through the correlations and reach the\nspatial-temporal positions in every future prediction, leading to significant\nerror propagation. To address these issues, we propose a Dynamic\nSwitch-Attention Network (DSAN) with a novel Multi-Space Attention (MSA)\nmechanism that measures the correlations between inputs and outputs explicitly.\nTo filter out irrelevant noises and alleviate the error propagation, DSAN\ndynamically extracts valuable information by applying self-attention over the\nnoisy input and bridges each output directly to the purified inputs via\nimplementing a switch-attention mechanism. Through extensive experiments on two\nspatial-temporal prediction tasks, we demonstrate the superior advantage of\nDSAN in both short-term and long-term predictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jun 2020 00:56:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-17"}

In this study, we propose a new\nframework in which OT is considered as a maximum a posteriori (MAP) solution of\na probabilistic generative model. With the proposed framework, we show that OT\nwith entropic regularization is equivalent to maximizing a posterior\nprobability of a probabilistic model called Collective Graphical Model (CGM),\nwhich describes aggregated statistics of multiple samples generated from a\ngraphical model. Interpreting OT as a MAP solution of a CGM has the following\ntwo advantages: (i) We can calculate the discrepancy between noisy histograms\nby modeling noise distributions.

Here, I present Craig and Sinclair with a dilemma.\nOn the one hand, if the direction of time is reducible, as friends of the\nMentaculus -- e.g., David Albert, Barry Loewer, and David Papineau -- maintain,\nthen there is reason to think that the direction of time and the entropic arrow\nof time align. But on that account, efficient causation is likely reducible to\nnon-causal phenomena. In consequence, contrary to Craig and Sinclair's\ntheological aims, things can begin to exist without causes. On the other hand,\nif the direction of time is not reducible, Craig and Sinclair's interpretation\nof bounce cosmologies is unjustified. Lastly, a reply to a potential objection\nmotivates a discussion of how to interpret bounce cosmologies on the tensed\ntheory of absolute time favored by Craig and Sinclair. I offer two\ninterpretations of bounce cosmologies that, given a tensed theory of absolute\ntime, are preferable to those Craig and Sinclair offer, yet inconsistent with\ntheir project in natural theology; on one interpretation, the universe does not\nrequire a supernatural cause and, on the other, bounce cosmologies represent\nthe universe as never having begun to exist.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jun 2020 02:56:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-17"}

However, most existing group recommendation models in\nEvent-Based Social Networks (EBSNs) focus on how to aggregate group members'\npreferences to form group preferences. In these models, the influence of\ncontexts on groups is considered but simply defined in a manual way, which\ncannot model the complex and deep interactions between contexts and groups. In\nthis paper, we propose an Attention-based Context-aware Group Event\nRecommendation model (ACGER) in EBSNs. ACGER models the deep, non-linear\ninfluence of contexts on users, groups, and events through multi-layer neural\nnetworks. Especially, a novel attention mechanism is designed to enable the\ninfluence weights of contexts on users/groups change dynamically with the\nevents concerned. Considering that groups may have completely different\nbehavior patterns from group members, we propose that the preference of a group\nneed to be obtained from indirect and direct perspectives (called indirect\npreference and direct preference respectively). In order to obtain the indirect\npreference, we propose a method of aggregating preferences based on attention\nmechanism. Compared with existing predefined strategies, this method can\nflexibly adapt the strategy according to the events concerned by the group. In\norder to obtain the direct preference, we employ neural networks to directly\nlearn it from group-event interactions. Furthermore, to make full use of rich\nuser-event interactions in EBSNs, we integrate the context-aware individual\nrecommendation task into ACGER, which enhances the accuracy of learning of user\nembeddings and event embeddings.

Under\nthe open boundary condition, these invariants further predict the number of\nzero- and $\\pi$-quasienergy modes localized around the edges of the system. We\nfinally construct a generalized version of the mean chiral displacement, which\ncould be employed as a dynamical probe to the topological invariants of\nnon-Hermitian Floquet phases in the CII symmetry class. Our work thus\nintroduces a new type of non-Hermitian Floquet topological matter, and further\nreveals the richness of topology and dynamics in driven open systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jun 2020 03:22:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 2020 02:20:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

In such settings, the training data is often statistically\nheterogeneous and manifests various distribution shifts across users, which\ndegrades the performance of the learnt model. The primary goal of this paper is\nto develop a robust federated learning algorithm that achieves satisfactory\nperformance against distribution shifts in users' samples. To achieve this\ngoal, we first consider a structured affine distribution shift in users' data\nthat captures the device-dependent data heterogeneity in federated settings.\nThis perturbation model is applicable to various federated learning problems\nsuch as image classification where the images undergo device-dependent\nimperfections, e.g. different intensity, contrast, and brightness. To address\naffine distribution shifts across users, we propose a Federated Learning\nframework Robust to Affine distribution shifts (FLRA) that is provably robust\nagainst affine Wasserstein shifts to the distribution of observed samples. To\nsolve the FLRA's distributed minimax problem, we propose a fast and efficient\noptimization method and provide convergence guarantees via a gradient Descent\nAscent (GDA) method. We further prove generalization error bounds for the\nlearnt classifier to show proper generalization from empirical distribution of\nsamples to the true underlying distribution. We perform several numerical\nexperiments to empirically support FLRA.

It consequently restricts the application of blockchain in mobile\nenvironment. However, edge computing can be utilized to solve the problem for\ninsufficient computing power of mobile devices in IOT. Edge servers can recruit\nmany mobile devices to contribute computing power together to mining and share\nthe reward of mining with these recruited mobile devices. In this paper, we\npropose an incentivizing mechanism based on edge computing for mobile\nblockchain. We design a two-stage Stackelberg Game to jointly optimize the\nreward of edge servers and recruited mobile devices. The edge server as the\nleader sets the expected fee for the recruited mobile devices in Stage I. The\nmobile device as a follower provides its computing power to mine according to\nthe expected fee in Stage. It proves that this game can obtain a uniqueness\nNash Equilibrium solution under the same or different expected fee. In the\nsimulation experiment, we obtain a result curve of the profit for the edge\nserver with the different ratio between the computing power from the edge\nserver and mobile devices. In addition, the proposed scheme has been compared\nwith the MDG scheme for the profit of the edge server. The experimental results\nshow that the profit of the proposed scheme is more than that of the MDG scheme\nunder the same total computing power.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jun 2020 04:14:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2020 14:40:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-02"}

Besides low dimensionality, frustration is the other well-known\nsuppressor of phase transitions. Here I show that surprisingly, a strongly\nfrustrated one-dimensional two-leg ladder Ising model can exhibit a marginal\nfinite-temperature phase transition.

A plug-and-play\nsmart camera for crowd surveillance has numerous constraints different from\ntypical anomaly detection: the training data cannot be used iteratively; there\nare no training labels; and training and classification needs to be performed\nsimultaneously. We tackle all these constraints with our approach in this\npaper. We propose a Core Anomaly-Detection (CAD) neural network which learns\nthe motion behavior of objects in the scene with an unsupervised method. On\naverage over standard datasets, CAD with a single epoch of training shows a\npercentage increase in Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 4.66% and 4.9% compared to\nthe best results with convolutional autoencoders and convolutional LSTM-based\nmethods, respectively. With a single epoch of training, our method improves the\nAUC by 8.03% compared to the convolutional LSTM-based approach. We also propose\nan Expectation Maximization filter which chooses samples for training the core\nanomaly-detection network. The overall framework improves the AUC compared to\nfuture frame prediction-based approach by 24.87% when crowd anomaly detection\nis performed on a video stream.

Graph summarization aims to find a compact representation resulting\nin faster algorithms and reduced storage needs. The flip side of graph\nsummarization is the loss of utility which diminishes its usability. The key\nquestions we address in this paper are: (1)How to summarize a graph without any\nloss of utility? (2)How to summarize a graph with some loss of utility but\nabove a user-specified threshold? (3)How to query graph summaries without graph\nreconstruction?} We also aim at making graph summarization available for the\nmasses by efficiently handling web-scale graphs using only a consumer-grade\nmachine. Previous works suffer from conceptual limitations and lack of\nscalability. In this work, we make three key contributions. First, we present a\nutility-driven graph summarization method, based on a clique and independent\nset decomposition, that produces significant compression with zero loss of\nutility. The compression provided is significantly better than state-of-the-art\nin lossless graph summarization, while the runtime is two orders of magnitude\nlower. Second, we present a highly scalable algorithm for the lossy case, which\nforegoes the expensive iterative process that hampers previous work. Our\nalgorithm achieves this by combining a memory reduction technique and a novel\nbinary-search approach. In contrast to the competition, we are able to handle\nweb-scale graphs in a single machine without a performance impediment as the\nutility threshold (and size of summary) decreases. Third, we show that our\ngraph summaries can be used as-is to answer several important classes of\nqueries, such as triangle enumeration, Pagerank, and shortest paths.

LANN constructs individual piecewise\nlinear approximation for the activation function of each neuron, and minimizes\nthe number of linear regions to satisfy a required approximation degree.

In other words, this work justifies the use of the\ngeneralized Banzhaf index as a model explanation by showing that it uniquely\nsatisfies a set of natural desiderata and that it is the optimal local\napproximation of a black-box model.\n  Our empirical evaluation of our measure highlights how it manages to capture\ndesirable behavior, whereas other measures that do not satisfy our axioms\nbehave in an unpredictable manner.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jun 2020 07:48:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Mar 2021 07:16:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-30"}

We aim to provide the\nfirst broadband spectral modeling of Mrk 359 describing its emission spectrum\nfrom the UV up to the hard X-rays. To do this, we performed temporal and\nspectral data analysis, characterising the amplitude and spectral changes of\nthe Mrk 359 time series and computing the 2-10 keV normalised excess variance.\nThe spectral broadband modelling assumes the standard hot Comptonising corona\nand reflection component, while for the soft excess we tested two different\nmodels: a warm, optically thick Comptonising corona (the two-corona model) and\na reflection model in which the soft-excess is the result of a blurred\nreflected continuum and line emission (the reflection model). High and low flux\nstates were observed during the campaign. The former state has a softer\nspectral shape, while the latter shows a harder one. The photon index is in the\n1.75-1.89 range, and only a lower limit to the hot-corona electron temperature\ncan be found. A constant reflection component, likely associated with distant\nmatter, is observed.

Owing to the\ninfluence of the microstructure on the properties of a material, the stability\nof three-dimensional rods in a representative polycrystalline system is\nextensively analysed. A multiphase-field model, which recovers the physical\nlaws and sharp-interface relations, and includes grain boundary diffusion, is\nadopted to investigate the morphological evolution of the precipitate.\nMoreover, the efficiency of the numerical approach is ensured by establishing\nthe volume-preserving chemical equilibrium through the incorporation TCFe8\n(CALPHAD) data and solving phase-field evolution in the Allen-Cahn framework.\nThe morphological evolution of the rod in the multiphase system exhibits a\nunique transformation mechanism which is significantly different from the\nevolution of an isolated finite-structure. It is realised that, in a\npolycrystalline arrangement, irrespective of the initial rod-size , the\nshape-change begins with the energy-minimising events at the triple junctions.\nThis early transformation renders a characteristic morphology at the\nlongitudinal ends of the structure, which introduces sufficient driving-force\nthrough the curvature-difference for the subsequent morphological changes. The\ncontinued mass transfer to the terminations, ultimately, breaks-off the rod\ninto separate entities that are entangled in the grain boundary.

We prove stability and\nsharp a priori error estimates for a linear advection equation by using a\nspecially tailored projection and conducting some parts of a standard\nconvergence analysis for both meshes. By allowing an arbitrary degree of\nenrichment on both, the coarse and the fine mesh (also including the case of no\nenrichment), our analysis technique is very general in the sense that our\nresults cover the range from the standard continuous finite element method to\nthe standard discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method with (or without) local subcell\nenrichment.

As networks grow in size and\ncomplexity, training time can be reduced through low-precision data\nrepresentations and computations. However, in doing so the final accuracy\nsuffers due to the problem of vanishing gradients. Existing state-of-the-art\nmethods combat this issue by means of a mixed-precision approach utilising two\ndifferent precision levels, FP32 (32-bit floating-point) and FP16/FP8\n(16-/8-bit floating-point), leveraging the hardware support of recent GPU\narchitectures for FP16 operations to obtain performance gains. This work pushes\nthe boundary of quantised training by employing a multilevel optimisation\napproach that utilises multiple precisions including low-precision fixed-point\nrepresentations. The novel training strategy, MuPPET, combines the use of\nmultiple number representation regimes together with a precision-switching\nmechanism that decides at run time the transition point between precision\nregimes. Overall, the proposed strategy tailors the training process to the\nhardware-level capabilities of the target hardware architecture and yields\nimprovements in training time and energy efficiency compared to\nstate-of-the-art approaches. Applying MuPPET on the training of AlexNet,\nResNet18 and GoogLeNet on ImageNet (ILSVRC12) and targeting an NVIDIA Turing\nGPU, MuPPET achieves the same accuracy as standard full-precision training with\ntraining-time speedup of up to 1.84$\\times$ and an average speedup of\n1.58$\\times$ across the networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jun 2020 10:14:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-18"}

Thermodynamically, normal\noxygen buffers produce water comparable in mole number to or more than\nhydrogen. Thus, the primordial atmosphere would likely be highly enriched with\nwater vapour; however, the primordial atmosphereshave been always assumed to\nhave the solar abundances. Here we integrate the 1D structure of such an\nenriched atmosphere of sub-Earths embedded in a protoplanetary disc around an M\ndwarf of 0.3$M_\\odot$ and investigate the effects of water enrichment on the\natmospheric properties with focus on water amount.

Although close-in Mars-mass\nplanets likely lose the captured water via disc dispersal and\nphoto-evaporation, these results suggest that there are more sub-Earths with\nEarth-like water contents than previously predicted. How much water terrestrial\nplanets really obtain and retain against subsequent loss, however, depends on\nefficiencies of water production, mixing in the atmosphere and magma ocean, and\nphoto-evaporation, detailed investigation for which should be made in the\nfuture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jun 2020 10:56:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

To address this problem, we use the last layer of the\ndiscriminator as a feature map to study the distribution of the real and the\nfake data.

If, however, the contact persons\nof every infected patient could be identified, the number of virus\ntransmissions could be reduced, while the more incisive measures could be\nsoftened. For this purpose, contact tracing using smartphones is being\nconsidered as a promising technique. Here, smartphones emit and scan for\nBluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signals for detecting devices in range. When a\ndevice is detected, its distance is estimated by evaluating its received signal\nstrength. The main insight that is exploited for distance estimation is that\nthe attenuation of a signal increases with the distance along which it has\ntraveled. However, besides distance, there are multiple additional factors that\nimpact the attenuation and hence disturb distance estimation. Among them,\nfrequency-selective hardware and signal propagation belong to the most\nsignificant ones. For example, a BLE device transmits beacons on three\ndifferent frequencies (channels), while the transmit power and the receiver\nsensitivity depend on the frequency. As a result, the received signal strength\nvaries for each channel, even when the distance remains constant. However, the\ninformation on which wireless channel a beacon has been received is not made\navailable to a smartphone. Hence, this error cannot be compensated, e.g., by\ncalibration. In this paper, we for the first time provide a solution to detect\nthe wireless channel on which a packet has been received on a smartphone. We\nexperimentally evaluate our proposed technique on multiple different smartphone\nmodels.

In this paper, we propose an algorithm that can train different\nSVM models in a \\emph{unified} scheme.

Particularly, for training robust SVM models with nonconvex losses,\nUniSVM has a dominant advantage over all existing algorithms because it has a\nclosed-form solution per iteration, while the existing algorithms always need\nto solve an L1SVM/L2SVM per iteration. Furthermore, by the low-rank\napproximation of the kernel matrix, UniSVM can solve the large-scale nonlinear\nproblems with efficiency.

Associated measurements\ntherefore provide direct constraints on the ultraviolet structure of the\nunderlying hypercolour dynamics. In this paper we employ a minimal version of\ntop compositeness to discuss how measurements related to the top's electroweak\ngauge interactions can inform the potential composite nature of the TeV scale.\nIn doing so, we identify the dominant factors that limit the BSM sensitivity.\nExtrapolating to a future 100 TeV hadron collider, we demonstrate that top\nquark measurements performed at highest precision can provide complementary\ninformation to resonance search by performing a representative resonant top\npartner search that specifically targets the correlated resonant electroweak\ntop partner signatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jun 2020 12:40:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Oct 2020 11:11:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-28"}

The common assumption is that these\ninput-gradients contain information regarding $p_{\\theta} ( y \\mid x)$, the\nmodel's discriminative capabilities, thus justifying their use for\ninterpretability. However, in this work we show that these input-gradients can\nbe arbitrarily manipulated as a consequence of the shift-invariance of softmax\nwithout changing the discriminative function. This leaves an open question: if\ninput-gradients can be arbitrary, why are they highly structured and\nexplanatory in standard models?\n  We investigate this by re-interpreting the logits of standard softmax-based\nclassifiers as unnormalized log-densities of the data distribution and show\nthat input-gradients can be viewed as gradients of a class-conditional density\nmodel $p_{\\theta}(x \\mid y)$ implicit within the discriminative model.

We test this hypothesis by studying the effect of\ndensity alignment on gradient explanations. To achieve this alignment we use\nscore-matching, and propose novel approximations to this algorithm to enable\ntraining large-scale models.\n  Our experiments show that improving the alignment of the implicit density\nmodel with the data distribution enhances gradient structure and explanatory\npower while reducing this alignment has the opposite effect.

As recently demonstrated, high-z submillimetre galaxies (SMGs) are\nthe perfect background sample for tracing the mass density profiles of galaxies\nand clusters (baryonic and dark matter) and their time-evolution through\ngravitational lensing. Their magnification bias, a weak gravitational lensing\neffect, is a powerful tool for constraining the free parameters of a halo\noccupation distribution (HOD) model and potentially also some of the main\ncosmological parameters. Aims. The aim of this work is to test the capability\nof the magnification bias produced on high-z SMGs as a cosmological probe. We\nexploit cross-correlation data to constrain not only astrophysical parameters\n($M_{min}$, $M_1$, and $\\alpha$), but also some of the cosmological ones\n($\\Omega_m$, $\\sigma_8$, and $H_0$) for this proof of concept. Methods. The\nmeasured cross-correlation function between a foreground sample of GAMA\ngalaxies with spectroscopic redshifts in the range 0.2 < z < 0.8 and a\nbackground sample of H-ATLAS galaxies with photometric redshifts >1.2 is\nmodelled using the traditional halo model description that depends on HOD and\ncosmological parameters.

Recently, deep learning has achieved promising performance in the CD\ntask. However, the deep models are task-specific and CD data set bias often\nexists, hence it is inevitable that deep CD models would suffer degraded\nperformance after transferring it from original CD data set to new ones, making\nmanually label numerous samples in the new data set unavoidable, which costs a\nlarge amount of time and human labor. How to learn a transferable CD model in\nthe data set with enough labeled data (original domain) but can well detect\nchanges in another data set without labeled data (target domain)? This is\ndefined as the cross-domain change detection problem. In this paper, we propose\na novel deep siamese domain adaptation convolutional neural network (DSDANet)\narchitecture for cross-domain CD. In DSDANet, a siamese convolutional neural\nnetwork first extracts spatial-spectral features from multi-temporal images.\nThen, through multi-kernel maximum mean discrepancy (MK-MMD), the learned\nfeature representation is embedded into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space\n(RKHS), in which the distribution of two domains can be explicitly matched. By\noptimizing the network parameters and kernel coefficients with the source\nlabeled data and target unlabeled data, DSDANet can learn transferrable feature\nrepresentation that can bridge the discrepancy between two domains.

Controllability is not useful in\nexplaining the tracking behavior of system outputs, a gap that is often\noverlooked. Trackability addresses this gap by characterizing whether system\ndynamics permits tracking of certain reference commands, irrespective of the\ncontroller/control action used. While earlier literature has discussed\nclosely-related ideas, lack of consistency in terminology and focus in the\nliterature has necessitated defining trackability in a simple but rigorous\nmanner. We present definitions for trackability based on elementary linear\nalgebra and propose a rank test for determining trackability of systems, while\nposing tracking control as an existence question. We discuss in some detail the\nrelationship of this rank test with other results in the literature. These\nresults are then used to generate insights about trackable systems and more\nimportantly to gain insights in to tracking behavior of systems that are not\ntrackable. We also define three indices that indicate the expected tracking\nbehavior of the system. Furthermore, we also present a Venn diagram explaining\nin detail the connections between trackability and other fundamental system\nproperties like controllability, observability and output controllability,\nwhile discussing several facts that elaborate these connections.

It aims to identify the aspect terms (a.k.a. opinion targets)\nof a product or service in each sentence. However, expensive annotation process\nis usually involved to acquire sufficient token-level labels for each domain.\nTo address this limitation, some previous works propose domain adaptation\nstrategies to transfer knowledge from a sufficiently labeled source domain to\nunlabeled target domains. But due to both the difficulty of fine-grained\nprediction problems and the large domain gap between domains, the performance\nremains unsatisfactory. This work conducts a pioneer study on leveraging\nsentence-level aspect category labels that can be usually available in\ncommercial services like review sites to promote token-level transfer for the\nextraction purpose. Specifically, the aspect category information is used to\nconstruct pivot knowledge for transfer with assumption that the interactions\nbetween sentence-level aspect category and token-level aspect terms are\ninvariant across domains. To this end, we propose a novel multi-level\nreconstruction mechanism that aligns both the fine-grained and coarse-grained\ninformation in multiple levels of abstractions. Comprehensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our approach can fully utilize sentence-level aspect category\nlabels to improve cross-domain aspect extraction with a large performance gain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jun 2020 15:11:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-17"}

Therefore a paradigmatic example of an exactly\nsolvable extended system in a cavity becomes highly desireable. To fill this\ngap we revisit Sommerfeld's theory of the free electron gas in cavity quantum\nelectrodynamics (QED). We solve this system analytically in the long-wavelength\nlimit for an arbitrary number of non-interacting electrons, and we demonstrate\nthat the electron-photon ground state is a Fermi liquid which contains virtual\nphotons. In contrast to models of finite systems, no ground state exists if the\ndiamagentic $\\textbf{A}^2$ term is omitted. Further, by performing linear\nresponse we show that the cavity field induces plasmon-polariton excitations\nand modifies the optical and the DC conductivity of the electron gas. Our exact\nsolution allows us to consider the thermodynamic limit for both electrons and\nphotons by constructing an effective quantum field theory. The continuum of\nmodes leads to a many-body renormalization of the electron mass, which modifies\nthe fermionic quasiparticle excitations of the Fermi liquid and the\nWigner-Seitz radius of the interacting electron gas.

Reconnection\neffects could convert some of the energy of the turbulent magnetic field into\nthe thermal energy of the surrounding medium, leaving more ordered magnetic\nfields, as is observed in the magnetic arms. Sensitive radio and X-ray data for\nthe grand-design spiral galaxy M 83 are used for a detailed analysis of the\npossible interactions of magnetic fields with hot gas, including a search for\nsignatures of gas heating by magnetic reconnection effects. Magnetic field\nstrengths and energies derived from the radio emission are compared with the\nparameters of the hot gas calculated from the model fits to sensitive X-ray\nspectra of the hot gas emission.

First we consider the case that $p$ is the geometric\ndistribution with parameter $1-q\\in(0,1)$. In this case, the $p$-shifted random\npermutation has the Mallows distribution with parameter $q$. Let\n$P_n^{b;\\text{Geo}(1-q)}$ and $P_n^{s;\\text{Geo}(1-q)}$denote the biased and\nthe shifted distributions on $S_n$. The expected number of inversions of a\npermutation under $P_n^{s;\\text{Geo}(1-q)}$ is greater than under\n$P_n^{b;\\text{Geo}(1-q)}$, and under either of these, a permutation tends to\nhave many fewer inversions than it would have under the uniform distribution.\nFor fixed $n$, both $P_n^{b;\\text{Geo}(1-q)}$ and $P_n^{s;\\text{Geo}(1-q)}$\nconverge weakly as $q\\to1$ to the uniform distribution on $S_n$.

The fraction of stars with detectable He I IR variation remains\nlower than 10% for stars earlier than M3.0 V, while it exceeds 30% for the\nlater spectral sub-types. Flares are accompanied by particularly pronounced\nline variations, including strongly broadened lines with red and blue\nasymmetries. However, we also find evidence for enhanced He I IR absorption,\nwhich is potentially associated with increased high-energy irradiation levels\nat flare onset. Generally, He I IR and H$\\alpha$ line variations tend to be\ncorrelated, with H$\\alpha$ being the most sensitive indicator in terms of\npseudo-equivalent width variation. This makes the He I IR triplet a favourable\ntarget for planetary transmission spectroscopy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jun 2020 11:10:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-12"}

In this work we propose a Monte Carlo method\n(MCTree), which directly approaches the dynamic nature of arriving requests in\nthe DVRP. The method is also hybridized (MCTree+PSO) with our previous\nTwo-Phase Multi-swarm Particle Swarm Optimization (2MPSO) algorithm.\n  Our method is based on two assumptions. First, that we know a bounding\nrectangle of the area in which the requests might appear. Second, that the\ninitial requests' sizes and frequency of appearance are representative for the\nyet unknown clients' requests. In order to solve the DVRP we divide the working\nday into several time slices in which we solve a static problem. In our Monte\nCarlo approach we randomly generate the unknown clients' requests with uniform\nspatial distribution over the bounding rectangle and requests' sizes uniformly\nsampled from the already known requests' sizes. The solution proposal is\nconstructed with the application of a clustering algorithm and a route\nconstruction algorithm.\n  The MCTree method is tested on a well established set of benchmarks proposed\nby Kilby et al. and is compared with the results achieved by applying our\nprevious 2MPSO algorithm and other literature results. The proposed MCTree\napproach achieves a better time to quality trade-off then plain heuristic\nalgorithms.

These nuisances are caused by\nthe fact that face covers are based on material barriers, which prevent inward\nand outward propagation of aerosol and droplets containing the pathogen.\nApplying well established gas-particle flow formalism, we study a non-material\nbased protection barrier created by a flow of well directed down stream of air\nacross the front of the open face.

Results showed a fuel consumption and CO2\nemissions reduction of 28% and 34% respectively in the scenario in which\nresources were bundled in one single truck.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jun 2020 09:59:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 16 Aug 2020 11:57:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-18"}

Controlling the rapidly evolving disease requires highly\nsensitive and specific diagnostics. While real-time RT-PCR is the most commonly\nused, these can take up to 8 hours, and require significant effort from\nhealthcare professionals. As such, there is a critical need for a quick and\nautomatic diagnostic system. Diagnosis from chest CT images is a promising\ndirection. However, current studies are limited by the lack of sufficient\ntraining samples, as acquiring annotated CT images is time-consuming. To this\nend, we propose a new deep learning algorithm for the automated diagnosis of\nCOVID-19, which only requires a few samples for training. Specifically, we use\ncontrastive learning to train an encoder which can capture expressive feature\nrepresentations on large and publicly available lung datasets and adopt the\nprototypical network for classification. We validate the efficacy of the\nproposed model in comparison with other competing methods on two publicly\navailable and annotated COVID-19 CT datasets.

Therefore, in the selection or\nconstruction of a suitable Schmitt-Trigger implementation, it is a necessity to\naccurately determine the metastable behavior. Only then one is able to compare\ndifferent designs and thus guide proper optimizations, and only then one can\nassess the potential for residual metastable upsets. However, while the state\nof the art provides a lot of research and practical characterization approaches\nfor flip-flops, comparatively little is known about Schmitt-Trigger\ncharacterization. Unlike the flip-flop with its single metastable point, the\nSchmitt-Trigger exhibits a whole range of metastable points depending on the\ninput voltage. Thus the task of characterization gets much more challenging.\n  In this paper we present different approaches to determine the metastable\nbehavior of Schmitt-Triggers using novel methods and mechanisms. We compare\ntheir accuracy and runtime by applying them to three common circuit\nimplementations. The achieved results are then used to reason about the\nmetastable behavior of the chosen designs which turns out to be problematic in\nsome cases. Overall the approaches proposed in this paper are generic and can\nbe extended beyond the Schmitt-Trigger, i.e., to efficiently characterize\nmetastable states in other circuits as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jun 2020 06:28:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-26"}

Both experiments\nand finite element simulations are conducted. First, we individually\ncharacterise the tensile and creep behaviour of the adhesive and adherent\nmaterials; an epoxy-based adhesive and polyethylene, respectively. This\ninformation is used to develop suitable constitutive models that are then\nimplemented in the commercial finite element package ABAQUS by means of user\nmaterial subroutines, UMATs. The numerical models are used to design the creep\ntests on the adhesive joints. Afterwards, an extensive experimental campaign is\nconducted where we characterise the static and creep behaviour of two joint\nconfigurations, SL and DS joints, and three selected values of the overlap\nlength. In regard to the static case, results reveal an increase in the failure\nload with increasing overlap length, of up to 10% for an overlap length of 39\nmm. Also, slightly better performance is observed for the SL joint\nconfiguration. For the creep experiments, we show that the DS adhesive joint\nconfiguration leads to much shorter elongations, relative to the SL joints.\nThese differences diminish with increasing overlap length but remain\nsubstantial in all cases. In both joint configurations, the elongation\nincreases with decreasing overlap length. For instance, increasing the overlap\nlength to 39 mm led to a 50% and a 30% reduction in elongation for SL and DS\njoints, respectively. Moreover, the numerical predictions show a good agreement\nwith the experiments. The stress redistribution is investigated and it is found\nthat the shear stress is highly sensitive to the testing time, with differences\nbeing more noticeable for the DS joint system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jun 2020 15:22:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-30"}
