We often build a VAE with\nan appropriate prior distribution to describe the desired properties of the\nlearned representations and introduce a divergence as a regularization term to\nclose the representations to the prior. Using differentially private SGD\n(DP-SGD), which randomizes a stochastic gradient by injecting a dedicated noise\ndesigned according to the gradient's sensitivity, we can easily build a\ndifferentially private model. However, we reveal that attaching several\ndivergences increase the sensitivity from O(1) to O(B) in terms of batch size\nB. That results in injecting a vast amount of noise that makes it hard to\nlearn. To solve the above issue, we propose term-wise DP-SGD that crafts\nrandomized gradients in two different ways tailored to the compositions of the\nloss terms. The term-wise DP-SGD keeps the sensitivity at O(1) even when\nattaching the divergence. We can therefore reduce the amount of noise.

In this paper, we propose a multi-criteria optimization framework,\nwhich jointly optimizes the stability robustness and transparency of a\nclosed-loop pHRI system for a given interaction controller. In particular, we\npropose a Pareto optimization framework that allows the designer to make\ninformed decisions by thoroughly studying the trade-off between stability\nrobustness and transparency. The proposed framework involves a search over the\ndiscretized controller parameter space to compute the Pareto front curve and a\nselection of controller parameters that yield maximum attainable transparency\nand stability robustness by studying this trade-off curve. The proposed\nframework not only leads to the design of an optimal controller, but also\nenables a fair comparison among different interaction controllers. In order to\ndemonstrate the practical use of the proposed approach, integer and fractional\norder admittance controllers are studied as a case study and compared both\nanalytically and experimentally. The experimental results validate the proposed\ndesign framework and show that the achievable transparency under fractional\norder admittance controller is higher than that of integer order one, when both\ncontrollers are designed to ensure the same level of stability robustness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jun 2020 16:46:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-13"}

(2020), the model fails to simultaneously resolve the Hubble tension and\nmaintain a good fit to both cosmic microwave background (CMB) and large-scale\nstructure (LSS) data. Here, we use redshift-space galaxy clustering data to\nsharpen constraints on the EDE model. We perform the first EDE analysis using\nthe full-shape power spectrum likelihood from the Baryon Oscillation\nSpectroscopic Survey (BOSS), based on the effective field theory (EFT) of LSS.\nThe inclusion of this likelihood in the EDE analysis yields a $25\\%$ tighter\nerror bar on $H_0$ compared to primary CMB data alone, yielding $H_0 =\n68.54^{+0.52}_{-0.95}$ km/s/Mpc ($68\\%$ CL).

We also refute claims that MCMC\nanalyses of EDE that omit SH0ES from the combined dataset yield misleading\nposteriors. Finally, we demonstrate that upcoming Euclid/DESI-like\nspectroscopic galaxy surveys can greatly improve the EDE constraints.

During the exploration phase, an agent collects samples without\nusing a pre-specified reward function. After the exploration phase, a reward\nfunction is given, and the agent uses samples collected during the exploration\nphase to compute a near-optimal policy. Jin et al. [2020] showed that in the\ntabular setting, the agent only needs to collect polynomial number of samples\n(in terms of the number states, the number of actions, and the planning\nhorizon) for reward-free RL. However, in practice, the number of states and\nactions can be large, and thus function approximation schemes are required for\ngeneralization. In this work, we give both positive and negative results for\nreward-free RL with linear function approximation. We give an algorithm for\nreward-free RL in the linear Markov decision process setting where both the\ntransition and the reward admit linear representations. The sample complexity\nof our algorithm is polynomial in the feature dimension and the planning\nhorizon, and is completely independent of the number of states and actions.

In\nthe case of merging binary black holes (BBHs), the essential CE phase takes\nplace at a stage when the first BH is already formed and the companion star\nexpands as a supergiant. We study which BH binaries with supergiant companions\nwill evolve through and potentially survive a CE phase. To this end, we compute\nenvelope binding energies from detailed massive stellar models at different\nevolutionary stages and metallicities. We make multiple physically extreme\nchoices of assumptions that favor easier CE ejection as well as account for\nrecent advancements in mass transfer stability criteria. We find that even with\nthe most optimistic assumptions, a successful CE ejection in BH (and also NS)\nbinaries is only possible if the donor is a massive convective-envelope giant,\na red supergiant (RSG). In other words, pre-CE progenitors of BBH mergers are\nBH binaries with RSG companions. We find that due to its influence on the\nradial expansion of massive giants, metallicity has an indirect but a very\nstrong effect on the envelope structure and binding energies of RSGs. Our\nresults suggest that merger rates from population synthesis models could be\nseverely overestimated, especially at low metallicity. Additionally, the lack\nof observed RSGs with luminosities above log($L/L_{\\odot}$) = 5.6-5.8,\ncorresponding to stars with $M > 40 M_{\\odot}$, puts into question the\nviability of the CE channel for the formation of the most massive BBH mergers.\nEither such RSGs elude detection due to very short lifetimes, or they do not\nexist and the CE channel can only produce BBH systems with total mass $< 50\nM_{\\odot}$.

By comparing to our\nexperimental reflectivity measurements, we show that the coupling of excitons\nto vibrations, manifested by phonon side bands in the absorption, has a strong\nimpact on the magnitude of light-matter coupling over a range of frequencies.\nOur approach opens the way towards a deeper understanding of polaritons in\norganic materials, and we highlight that a quantitatively accurate calculation\nof the exciton-photon interaction would require accounting for all sources of\ndisorder self-consistently.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jun 2020 18:00:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-07"}

To address the first question, we assume a general form for the\ndiscrete-time equations with two random variables and then follow the\nsystematic, brute-force GJ methodology by enforcing correct thermodynamics in\nlinear systems. It is concluded that correct configurational Boltzmann sampling\nof a particle in a harmonic potential implies correct configurational\nfree-particle diffusion, and that these requirements only can be accomplished\nif the two random variables per time step are identical. We consequently submit\nthat the GJ set represents all possible stochastic St{\\o}rmer-Verlet methods\nthat can reproduce time-step-independent statistics of linear systems. The\nsecond question is thus addressed within the GJ set. Based in part on numerical\nsimulations of complex molecular systems, and in part on analytic scaling of\ntime, we analyze the apparent difference in stability between different\nmethods. We attribute this difference to the inherent time scaling in each\nmethod, and suggest that this scaling may lead to inconsistencies in the\ninterpretation of dynamical and statistical simulation results.

However,\nthe effects of acceleration dominate when SEP events are small or when the ions\neven propagate scatter-free, and transport can dominate the time evolution of\nlarge events with streaming-limited intensities. Magnetic reconnection in solar\njets produces positive powers of A/Q from +2 to +7 and shock acceleration\nproduces mostly negative powers from -2 to +1 in small and moderate SEP events\nwhere transport effects are minimal.

This handshake is a 4D standing-wave that builds up\nacross space-time to transfer the conserved quantities of energy, momentum, and\nangular momentum in an interaction.

Continuing this\ntrend and going further, in the present study, we report some new insights into\nthis problem. First, we show that under the additive noise regression model,\nsuch a regression paradigm can be deduced from minimum distance estimation,\nimplying that the resulting estimator is essentially a minimum distance\nestimator and thus possesses robustness properties.

This strategy\nenables us to maintain complete \"build anything\" flexibility while offering a\ndevelopment platform that is accessible to novice programmers. Empirica's\narchitecture is designed to allow for parameterizable experimental designs,\nreusable protocols, and rapid development. These features will increase the\naccessibility of virtual lab experiments, remove barriers to innovation in\nexperiment design, and enable rapid progress in the understanding of\ndistributed human computation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jun 2020 21:28:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Dec 2020 15:57:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-13"}

This\nproblem is complicated by most astrophysically relevant systems' not having\nmodes that are analytically tractable. A ubiquitous workaround is to use not\nmodes, but multipole moments defined by spin weighted spherical harmonics.\nHowever, spherical multipole moments are only related to the modes of systems\nwithout angular momentum. As a result, they can obscure the underlying physics\nof astrophysically relevant systems, such as binary black hole merger and\nringdown. In such cases, spacetime angular momentum means that radiative modes\nare not spherical, but spheroidal in nature. Here, we work through various\nproblems related to spheroidal harmonics. We show for the first time that\nspheroidal harmonics are not only capable of representing arbitrary\ngravitational wave signals, but that they also possess a kind of orthogonality\nnot used before in general relativity theory.

We pay particular attention to the periodic change of the color of the dot\naccording to the rotation of the planet. Because of the large-scale\ninhomogeneous distribution of the planetary surface, the reflected light of the\ndot comprises different color components corresponding to land, ocean, ice, and\ncloud that cover the surface of the planet. If we decompose the color of the\ndot into several principle components, in turn, one can identify the presence\nof the different surface components.

As the areas to be mapped are\noften very large and AUV systems collecting seafloor imagery can only sample\nfrom a small portion of the survey area, the information gathered should be\nmaximised for each deployment. This paper illustrates how the habitat models\nthemselves can be used to plan more efficient AUV surveys by identifying where\nto collect further samples in order to most improve the habitat model. A\nBayesian neural network is used to predict visually-derived habitat classes\nwhen given broad-scale bathymetric data.

In this paper, we study the problem of estimating their dynamically\nvarying probability density, given the agents' individual dynamics (which can\nbe nonlinear and time-varying) and their states observed in real-time. The\ndensity evolution is shown to satisfy a linear partial differential equation\nuniquely determined by the agents' dynamics. We present a density filter which\ntakes advantage of the system dynamics to gradually improve its estimation and\nis scalable to the agents' population. Specifically, we use kernel density\nestimators (KDE) to construct a noisy measurement and show that, when the\nagents' population is large, the measurement noise is approximately\n``Gaussian''. With this important property, infinite-dimensional Kalman filters\nare used to design density filters. It turns out that the covariance of\nmeasurement noise depends on the true density.

Existing\nresearch in swarm robotics has mainly followed a bottom-up philosophy with\npredefined local coordination and control rules. However, it is arduous to\nverify the global requirements and analyze their performance. This motivates us\nto pursue a top-down approach, and develop a provable control strategy for\ndeploying a robotic swarm to achieve a desired global configuration.\nSpecifically, we use mean-field partial differential equations (PDEs) to model\nthe swarm and control its mean-field density (i.e., probability density) over a\nbounded spatial domain using mean-field feedback. The presented control law\nuses density estimates as feedback signals and generates corresponding velocity\nfields that, by acting locally on individual robots, guide their global\ndistribution to a target profile. The design of the velocity field is therefore\ncentralized, but the implementation of the controller can be fully distributed\n-- individual robots sense the velocity field and derive their own velocity\ncontrol signals accordingly. The key contribution lies in applying the concept\nof input-to-state stability (ISS) to show that the perturbed closed-loop system\n(a nonlinear and time-varying PDE) is locally ISS with respect to density\nestimation errors. The effectiveness of the proposed control laws is verified\nusing agent-based simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Jun 2020 01:48:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Mar 2021 20:16:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 18 Mar 2021 23:26:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-04"}

To\nachieve crash consistency without requiring unconventional architectural\nsupport, CoSpec leverages speculation assuming that power failure is not going\nto occur and thus holds all committed stores in a store buffer (SB), as if they\nwere speculative, in case of mispeculation. CoSpec compiler first partitions a\ngiven program into a series of recoverable code regions with the SB size in\nmind, so that no region overflows the SB. When the program control reaches the\nend of each region, the speculation turns out to be successful, thus releasing\nall the buffered stores of the region to NVM. If power failure occurs during\nthe execution of a region, all its speculative stores disappear in the volatile\nSB, i.e., they never affect program states in NVM. Consequently, the\ninterrupted region can be restarted with consistent program states in the wake\nof power failure. To hide the latency of the SB release, i.e., essentially NVM\nwrites, at each region boundary, CoSpec overlaps the NVM writes of the current\nregion with the speculative execution of the next region. Such instruction\nlevel parallelism gives an illusion of out-of-order execution on top of the\nin-order processor, achieving a speedup of more than 1.2X when there is no\npower outage. Our experiments on a set of real energy harvesting traces with\nfrequent outages demonstrate that CoSpec outperforms the state-of-the-art\nscheme by 1.8~3X on average.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Jun 2020 02:50:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-23"}

In doing so, we\nfirstly challenge the idea of generative models as explicit internal\nrepresentations for cognitive systems, suggesting that such models serve only\nas implicit descriptions for an observer. Secondly, we consider current\nproposals of predictive processing as a theory of cognition, focusing on some\nof its potential shortcomings and in particular on the idea that virtually any\nsystem admits a description in terms of prediction error minimisation,\nsuggesting that this theory may offer limited explanatory power for cognitive\nsystems. Finally, as a silver lining we emphasise the instrumental role this\nframework can nonetheless play as a mathematical tool for modelling cognitive\narchitectures interpreted in terms of Bayesian (active) inference.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Jun 2020 04:55:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Jun 2020 03:02:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-10"}

We employ a set of modified two-fluid\nhydrodynamic equations which incorporate the dynamics of the quantised\nvortices, rather than the conventional ones for a three-dimensional superfluid.\nAs far as the sound dispersion equation is concerned, the modification is\nessentially equivalent to replacing the static superfluid density with a\nfrequency dependent one, renormalised by the frequency dependent \"dielectric\nconstant\" of the vortices. This theory has two direct consequences. First,\nbecause the renormalised superfluid density at finite frequencies does not\ndisplay discontinuity across the superfluid transition, in contrast to the\nstatic superfluid density, the sound velocities vary smoothly across the\ntransition. Second, the theory includes dissipation due to free vortices, and\nthus naturally describes the sound-to-diffusion crossover for the second sound\nin the normal phase. With only one fitting parameter, our theory gives a\nperfect agreement with the experimental measurements of sound velocities across\nthe transition, as well as the quality factor in the vicinity of the\ntransition.

Two kinds of\nneutron stars are considered, i.e., normal neutron stars (the density vanishes\non gravity-bound surface) and strange stars (a sharp density discontinuity on\nself-bound surface). The polytropic model has only two parameter inputs in both\ncases: ($\\rho_{\\rm t}$, $\\gamma$) for gravity-bound objects, while ($\\rho_{\\rm\ns}$, $\\gamma$) for self-bound ones, with $\\rho_{\\rm t}$ the transition density,\n$\\rho_{\\rm s}$ the surface density and $\\gamma$ the polytropic exponent. In the\nmatter of $M_\\textrm{max}>2.3~M_{\\odot}$, it is found that the smallest\n$\\rho_{\\rm t}$ and $\\gamma$ should be $\\sim 0.50~\\rho_0$ and $\\sim 2.65$ for\nnormal neutron stars, respectively, whereas for strange star, we have $\\gamma >\n1.40$ if $\\rho_{\\rm s} > 1.0~\\rho_0$ and $\\rho_{\\rm s} < 1.58~\\rho_0$ if\n$\\gamma <2.0$ ($\\rho_0$ is the nuclear saturation density). These parametric\nresults could guide further research of the real EOS with any foundation of\nmicrophysics if a pulsar mass higher than $2.3~M_{\\odot}$ is measured in the\nfuture. We also derive rough results of common neutron star radius range, which\nis $9.8~\\rm{km} < R_{1.4} < 13.8~\\rm{km}$ for normal neutron stars and\n$10.5~\\rm{km} < R_{1.4} < 12.5~\\rm{km}$ for strange stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Jun 2020 07:49:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-21"}

The proposed strategy is based on\ncoordination between the real-time dispatch (RTD) phase and the real-time\ncontrol (RTC) phase.

This is\nachieved by taking codestreams associated with the coarsest resolution wavelet\nsub-band as input to approximate finer resolution sub-bands using a number of\ntransposed convolutional layers. Then, a series of convolutional layers models\nthe high-level semantic content of the approximated wavelet sub-band. Thus, the\nproposed approach models the multiresolution paradigm given in the JPEG 2000\ncompression algorithm in an end-to-end trainable unified neural network. In the\nclassification stage, the proposed approach takes only the coarsest resolution\nwavelet sub-bands as input, thereby reducing the time required to apply\ndecoding.

Our data show intrinsic\nmagnon damping and continuum-like excitations that cannot be explained by\nlinear spin wave theory. The intrinsic magnon linewidth $\\Gamma(q,E_{q})$ shows\nvery unusual momentum dependence, which our analysis shows to originate from\nthe combination of two-magnon decay and the Stoner continuum. By comparing the\ntheoretical predictions with the experiments, we identify where in the momentum\nand energy space one of the two factors becomes more dominant. Our work\nconstitutes a rare comprehensive study of the spin dynamics in metallic\nnon-collinear antiferromagnets. It reveals, for the first time, definite\nexperimental evidence of the higher-order effects in metallic antiferromagnets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Jun 2020 09:21:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 2020 06:07:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

In the spatial dimension, due to the\nconnectivity of the road network, the traffic flows between linked roads are\nclosely related. In terms of the temporal factor, although there exists a\ntendency among adjacent time points in general, the importance of distant past\npoints is not necessarily smaller than that of recent past points since traffic\nflows are also affected by external factors. In this study, an attention\ntemporal graph convolutional network (A3T-GCN) traffic forecasting method was\nproposed to simultaneously capture global temporal dynamics and spatial\ncorrelations. The A3T-GCN model learns the short-time trend in time series by\nusing the gated recurrent units and learns the spatial dependence based on the\ntopology of the road network through the graph convolutional network.

The\nproblem is that the inner product violates the triangle inequality property of\nfeature vectors. As a result, it cannot well capture fine-grained attribute\ninteractions, resulting in sub-optimal performance. Recently, the Euclidean\ndistance is exploited in FMs to replace the inner product and has delivered\nbetter performance.

However, its theoretical performance relative to other tests has\nbeen called into question. In the Gaussian sequence version of the global\ntesting problem, Donoho and Jin (2004) discovered a so-called \"weak, sparse\"\nasymptotic regime in which the higher criticism and Berk-Jones tests achieve a\nbetter detection boundary than the max test when all of the nonzero signal\nstrengths are identical. We study a more general model in which the non-null\nmeans are drawn from a generic distribution, and show that the detection\nboundary for the max test is optimal in the \"weak, sparse\" regime, provided\nthat the distribution's tail is no lighter than Gaussian.

It has now been possible to overcome some of the obstacles\nassociated with such supply of funds with the advent of online platforms like\nKiva, Prosper, LendingClub. Kiva for example, works with Micro Finance\nInstitutions (MFIs) in developing countries to build Internet profiles of\nborrowers with a brief biography, loan requested, loan term, and purpose. Kiva,\nin particular, allows lenders to fund projects in different sectors through\ngroup or individual funding. Traditional research studies have investigated\nvarious factors behind lender preferences purely from the perspective of loan\nattributes and only until recently have some cross-country cultural preferences\nbeen investigated. In this paper, we investigate lender perceptions of economic\nfactors of the borrower countries in relation to their preferences towards\nloans associated with different sectors. We find that the influence from\neconomic factors and loan attributes can have substantially different roles to\nplay for different sectors in achieving faster funding. We formally investigate\nand quantify the hidden biases prevalent in different loan sectors using recent\ntools from causal inference and regression models that rely on Bayesian\nvariable selection methods.

However, the\nstate-of-the-art data series indexes that are used for this purpose do not\nscale well for massive datasets in terms of performance, or storage costs. We\npinpoint the problem to the fact that existing summarizations of data series\nused for indexing cannot be sorted while keeping similar data series close to\neach other in the sorted order. This leads to two design problems. First,\ntraditional bulk-loading algorithms based on sorting cannot be used. Instead,\nindex construction takes place through slow top-down insertions, which create a\nnon-contiguous index that results in many random I/Os. Second, data series\ncannot be sorted and split across nodes evenly based on their median value;\nthus, most leaf nodes are in practice nearly empty. This further slows down\nquery speed and amplifies storage costs. To address these problems, we present\nCoconut. The first innovation in Coconut is an inverted, sortable data series\nsummarization that organizes data series based on a z-order curve, keeping\nsimilar series close to each other in the sorted order. As a result, Coconut is\nable to use bulk-loading techniques that rely on sorting to quickly build a\ncontiguous index using large sequential disk I/Os. We then explore prefix-based\nand median-based splitting policies for bottom-up bulk-loading, showing that\nmedian-based splitting outperforms the state of the art, ensuring that all\nnodes are densely populated. Overall, we show analytically and empirically that\nCoconut dominates the state-of-the-art data series indexes in terms of\nconstruction speed, query speed, and storage costs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Jun 2020 01:52:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-25"}

The\nnovel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, a.k.a. COVID-19) has proved to be extremely\ncontagious and the original outbreak from Asia has now spread to all\ncontinents. This situation will fruitfully profit from the study in regards of\nthe spread of the virus, assessing effective countermeasures to weight the\nimpact of the adopted strategies. The standard Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered\n(SIR) model is a very successful and widely used mathematical model for\npredicting the spread of an epidemic. We adopt the SIR model on a random\nnetwork and extend the model to include control strategies {\\em lockdown} and\n{\\em testing} -- two often employed mitigation strategies. The ability of these\nstrategies in controlling the pandemic spread is investigated by varying the\neffectiveness with which they are implemented. The possibility of a second\noutbreak is evaluated in detail after the mitigation strategies are withdrawn.\nWe notice that, in any case, a sudden interruption of such mitigation\nstrategies will likely induce a resurgence of a second outbreak, whose peak\nwill be correlated to the number of susceptible individuals. In fact, we find\nthat a population will remain vulnerable to the infection until the herd\nimmunity is achieved. We also test our model with real statistics and\ninformation on the epidemic spread in South Korea, Germany, and New York and\nfind a remarkable agreement with the simulation data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Jun 2020 15:55:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-26"}
