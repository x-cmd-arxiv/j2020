In this\npaper, we address any-shot, i.e. zero-shot and few-shot, sketch-based image\nretrieval (SBIR) tasks, where we introduce the few-shot setting for SBIR. For\nsolving these tasks, we propose a semantically aligned paired cycle-consistent\ngenerative adversarial network (SEM-PCYC) for any-shot SBIR, where each branch\nof the generative adversarial network maps the visual information from sketch\nand image to a common semantic space via adversarial training. Each of these\nbranches maintains cycle consistency that only requires supervision at the\ncategory level, and avoids the need of aligned sketch-image pairs. A\nclassification criteria on the generators' outputs ensures the visual to\nsemantic space mapping to be class-specific.

Of particular interest are\nbroadcasting real-time applications such as video-on-demand, where common\ncontents may be partially received by cellular users due to packet erasures\nover cellular links. Specifically, we investigate the problem of packet\ncompletion time, defined as the number of transmission slots necessary to\ndeliver a common content to all users. Drawing on graph theory, we develop an\noptimal packet completion time strategy by constructing a two-layer IDNC\nconflict graph. The higher-layer graph permits us to determine all feasible\npacket combinations that can be transmitted over the cellular link, while the\nlower-layer graph enables us to find all feasible network coded packets and\nidentify the set of users that can generate and transmit these packets via\nintermittently connected D2D links. By combining the higher-layer and the\nlower-layer IDNC conflict graphs, we demonstrate that finding the optimal IDNC\npackets to minimize the packet completion time problem is equivalent to finding\nthe maximum independent set of the two-layer IDNC conflict graph, which is\nknown to be an NP-hard problem. We design a scheme that invokes the\nBron-Kerbosch algorithm to find the optimal policy. To circumvent the high\ncomputational complexity required to reach the global optimum, we establish a\npolynomial-time solvable low-complexity heuristic to find an efficient\nsub-optimal solution.

While it avoids the pessimism of the\ntraditional adversarial model, in practice we cannot expect the input to be\npresented in perfectly random order. This has motivated research on ``best of\nboth worlds'' (algorithms with good performance on both purely stochastic and\npurely adversarial inputs), or even better, on inputs that are a mix of both\nstochastic and adversarial parts. Unfortunately the latter seems much harder to\nachieve and very few results of this type are known.\n  Towards advancing our understanding of designing such robust algorithms, we\npropose a random-order model with bursts of adversarial time steps. The\nassumption of burstiness of unexpected patterns is reasonable in many contexts,\nsince changes (e.g. spike in a demand for a good) are often triggered by a\ncommon external event. We then consider the Knapsack Secretary problem in this\nmodel: there is a knapsack of size $k$ (e.g., available quantity of a good),\nand in each of the $n$ time steps an item comes with its value and size in\n$[0,1]$ and the algorithm needs to make an irrevocable decision whether to\naccept or reject the item.\n  We design an algorithm that gives an approximation of $1 -\n\\tilde{O}(\\Gamma/k)$ when the adversarial time steps can be covered by $\\Gamma\n\\ge \\sqrt{k}$ intervals of size $\\tilde{O}(\\frac{n}{k})$. In particular,\nsetting $\\Gamma = \\sqrt{k}$ gives a $(1 - O(\\frac{\\ln^2\nk}{\\sqrt{k}}))$-approximation that is resistant to up to a $\\frac{\\ln^2\nk}{\\sqrt{k}}$-fraction of the items being adversarial, which is almost optimal\neven in the absence of adversarial items. Also, setting $\\Gamma =\n\\tilde{\\Omega}(k)$ gives a constant approximation that is resistant to up to a\nconstant fraction of items being adversarial.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Jun 2020 16:24:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-23"}

Most variants apparently have neutral effects for disease\nspread and symptoms severity. However, in the viral Spike protein, which is\nresponsible for host cell attachment and invasion, an emergent variant,\ncontaining the amino acid substitution D to G in position 614 (D614G), was\nsuggested to increase viral infection capability.

For example, the commonly studied steady-state\n(time-averaged) flow response corresponds to a superposition of step responses\nin our modeling framework.

Hence interpolation errors can accumulate, and acquisition\nnoise in the captured pixels can pollute neighbors in two consecutive\nprocessing stages. In this paper, we propose a joint processing framework that\nperforms demosaicking and grid-to-grid mapping simultaneously---thus limiting\nnoise pollution to one interpolation. Specifically, we first obtain a reverse\nmapping function from a regular on-grid location in the rectified image to an\nirregular off-grid location in the camera's Bayer-patterned image. For each\npair of adjacent pixels in the rectified grid, we estimate its gradient using\nthe pair's neighboring pixel gradients in three colors in the Bayer-patterned\ngrid. We construct a similarity graph based on the estimated gradients, and\ninterpolate pixels in the rectified grid directly via graph Laplacian\nregularization (GLR). Experiments show that our joint method outperforms\nseveral competing local methods that execute demosaicking and rectification in\nsequence, by up to 0.52 dB in PSNR and 0.086 in SSIM on the publicly available\ndataset, and by up to 5.53dB in PSNR and 0.411 in SSIM on the in-house\nconstructed dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Jun 2020 19:12:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-23"}

A promising way out is to test programs modularly, e.g., on a per\nfunction or class basis. Alas, this idea hits a roadblock in modern programming\nlanguages In modern languages, components expect functions, objects, and even\nclasses as inputs. The crux of the problem is that existing concolic testing\ntechniques cannot faithfully capture the complex interactions between a\nhigher-order program and its inputs in order to distill it in a first-order\nformula that an SMT solver can work with. In this paper, we take the first step\ntowards solving the problem; we offer a design, semantics, and prototype for\nconcolic testing of higher-order functions. Inspired by work on higher-order\nsymbolic execution, our model constructs inputs for higher-order functions with\na canonical shape. This enables the concolic tester to keep track of which\npieces of the control-flow path of the higher-order function depend on the\nshape of its input and which do not. The concolic tester encodes the pieces\nthat do not depend on the shape of the input as a first-order formula.\nSubsequently, similar to a first-order concolic tester, it leverages an SMT\nsolver to produce another input with the same shape but that explores a\ndifferent control-flow path of the higher-order function. As a separate\ndimension, the concolic tester iteratively explores the canonical shapes for\nthe input and, investigating all the ways a higher-order function can interact\nwith its input, searching for bugs. To validate our design, we prove that if a\nhigher-order function has a bug, our concolic tester will eventually construct\nan input that triggers the bug. Using our design as a blueprint, we implement a\nprototype concolic tester and confirm that it discovers bugs in a variety of\nhigher-order programs from the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Jun 2020 19:29:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-23"}

In this paper, we analyze the\nconvergence behaviors of stochastic gradient descent with label smoothing\nregularization for solving non-convex problems and show that an appropriate LSR\ncan help to speed up the convergence by reducing the variance. More\ninterestingly, we proposed a simple yet effective strategy, namely Two-Stage\nLAbel smoothing algorithm (TSLA), that uses LSR in the early training epochs\nand drops it off in the later training epochs. We observe from the improved\nconvergence result of TSLA that it benefits from LSR in the first stage and\nessentially converges faster in the second stage. To the best of our knowledge,\nthis is the first work for understanding the power of LSR via establishing\nconvergence complexity of stochastic methods with LSR in non-convex\noptimization.

Specifically, for\na field on resonance with the atomic transition energy, the usual Mollow\nspectrum is replaced by a four peak structure, and for a frequency that is half\nof the atomic transition energy, the time-dependent spectrum develops a second\nharmonic peak with a superimposed Mollow triplet.

It is\nfound that -- in addition to the conventional acoustic streaming flow -- a\ntime-averaged electroosmotic flow is induced. Employing the stream\nfunction-vorticity formulation, it is shown that the Maxwell stress term causes\nan electroosmotic propulsion that is qualitatively identical to the one\ndiscussed in the context of alternating current (AC) electroosmosis (EOF).\nDifferences arise mainly due to the high actuation frequencies of SAWs, which\nare in the MHz range rather than in the kHz regime typical for ACEOF. Moreover,\nthe instantaneous spatial periodicity of the EOF in the travel direction of the\nSAW is intrinsically linked to the dispersion relation of the latter rather\nthan a free geometric parameter. This leads to a specific frequency band where\nan EOF of sizable magnitude can be found. On the low frequency end, the ratio\nbetween the electric double layer (EDL) thickness and the SAW wavelength\nbecomes extremely small so that the net force leading to a non-vanishing\ntime-averaged flow becomes equally small. On the high frequency end, the RC\ntime of the EDL is much larger than the inverse of the SAW frequency leading to\na vanishing effective charge density of the EDL. For a parallel-plate channel,\nthe EOF can be maximized by using two SAWs on both channel walls that have the\nsame frequency but are phase-shifted by $180^\\circ$. It appears that the\nSAW-EOF is the dominant pumping mechanism for such a scenario.

Here, 2,850 records were retrieved from\nPubMed and EMBASE in March 2020 using search terms: personal, health, and\nlibrary. Information related to the health topic, target population, study\npurpose, library function, data source, data science method, evaluation\nmeasure, and status were extracted from each eligible study. In addition,\nknowledge discovery methods, including co-occurrence analysis and multiple\ncorrespondence analysis, were used to explore research trends of PHL. Results:\nAfter screening, this systematic review focused on a dozen articles related to\nPHL. These encompassed health topics such as infectious diseases, congestive\nheart failure, electronic prescribing. Data science methods included relational\ndatabase, information retrieval technology, ontology construction technology.\nEvaluation measures were heterogeneous regarding PHL functions and settings. At\nthe time of writing, only one of the PHLs described in these articles is\navailable for the public while the others are either prototypes or in the pilot\nstage. Discussion: Although PHL researches have used different methods to\naddress problems in diverse health domains, there is a lack of an effective PHL\nto meet the needs of older adults. Conclusion: The development of PHLs may\ncreate an unprecedented opportunity for promoting the health of older consumers\nby providing diverse health information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Jun 2020 01:11:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-23"}

These\nchemical features are expected to depend on the composition of ice mantle which\nis set in the prestellar phase. We calculated the gas-grain chemical reaction\nnetwork considering a layered ice-mantle structure in star-forming cores, to\ninvestigate how the hot corino chemistry and WCCC depend on the physical\ncondition of the static phase before the onset of gravitational collapse. We\nfound that WCCC becomes more active, if the temperature is lower, or the visual\nextinction is lower in the static phase, or the static phase is longer.\nDependence of hot corino chemistry on the static-phase condition is more\ncomplex. While CH$_3$OH is less abundant in the models with warmer static\nphase, some COMs are formed efficiently in those warm models, since there are\nvarious formation paths of COMs. If the visual extinction is lower, photolysis\nmakes COMs less abundant in the static phase.

ITR predicted by DMM is on the order of 10-9 m2K/W. Using this\nITR, UO2-BeO thermal conductivities are calculated by theoretical models and\ncompared with experimental data. The results indicate that DMM prediction is\napplicable to the interface between UO2 and dispersed BeO, while not applicable\nto the interface between UO2 and continuous BeO. If the thermal conductivity of\nUO2 containing continuous BeO was to be in agreement with experimental data,\nits ITR should be on the order of 10-6 - 10-5 m2K/W. Therefore, the vibrational\nmismatch between UO2 and BeO considered by DMM is the major mechanism for\nattenuating the heat flux through UO2/dispersed-BeO interface, but not for\nUO2/continuous-BeO interface. Furthermore, it is found that the presence of ITR\nleads to the dependence of the thermal conductivity of UO2 containing dispersed\nBeO on BeO size. With the decrease in BeO size, UO2-BeO thermal conductivity\ndecreases. When BeO size is smaller than a critical value, UO2-BeO thermal\nconductivity becomes even smaller than UO2 thermal conductivity. For UO2\ncontaining continuous BeO, the thermal conductivity decreases with the decrease\nin the size of UO2 granule surrounded by BeO, but not necessarily smaller than\nUO2 thermal conductivity. Under a critical temperature, UO2-BeO thermal\nconductivity is always larger than UO2 thermal conductivity. Above the critical\ntemperature, UO2-BeO thermal conductivity is larger than UO2 thermal\nconductivity only when UO2 granule size is large enough. The conditions for\nachieving the targeted enhancement of UO2 thermal conductivity by doping with\nBeO are derived.

We then characterize the phase retrieval stability of the signal $f$ by\ntwo measures that are commonly used in graph theory to quantify graph\nconnectivity: the Cheeger constant of $G_f$ for real valued signals, and the\nalgebraic connectivity of $G_f$ for complex valued signals.\n  We use our results to study the stability of two phase retrieval models that\ncan be cast as LSCC measurement schemes, and focus on understanding for which\nsignals the \"curse of dimensionality\" can be avoided.

It associates\nwith an algebra A or a relational structure S a graph, whose vertices are the\nelements of A (or S), the edges represent subsets of A such that the\nrestriction of some term operation of A is `good' on the subset, that is, act\nas an operation of one of the 3 types: semilattice, majority, or affine.

Keynesianism developed as a policy program to counter classical\nliberalism, which attributes priority to the autonomy of the market economy and\ntries to limit the role of government. In general, the core of every policy\nprogram consists in an unfalsifiable worldview and a value judgment that remain\nunchanged. On the other hand, a policy strategy with a protective belt\ninevitably evolves owing to changes in reality and advances in scientific\nknowledge. This is why the Keynesian policy strategy has shifted from being\nfiscal-led to one that is monetary-led because of the influence of monetarism;\nfurther, the Great Recession has even led to their integration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Jun 2020 09:47:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-23"}

This is because public regulations imposed by national and local\ngovernments to deter the spread of infection inevitably involves a deliberate\nsuppression of the level of economic activity. Given this trade-off between\neconomic activity and epidemic prevention, governments should execute public\ninterventions to minimize social and economic losses from the pandemic. A major\nproblem regarding the resultant economic losses is that it unequally impacts\ncertain strata of the society. This raises an important question on how such\neconomic losses should be shared equally across the society. At the same time,\nthere is some antipathy towards economic compensation by means of public debt,\nwhich is likely to increase economic burden in the future.

Some\nof JUNO's features make it an excellent experiment for $^8$B solar neutrino\nmeasurements, such as its low-energy threshold, its high energy resolution\ncompared to water Cherenkov detectors, and its much large target mass compared\nto previous liquid scintillator detectors. In this paper we present a\ncomprehensive assessment of JUNO's potential for detecting $^8$B solar\nneutrinos via the neutrino-electron elastic scattering process. A reduced 2~MeV\nthreshold on the recoil electron energy is found to be achievable assuming the\nintrinsic radioactive background $^{238}$U and $^{232}$Th in the liquid\nscintillator can be controlled to 10$^{-17}$~g/g. With ten years of data\ntaking, about 60,000 signal and 30,000 background events are expected. This\nlarge sample will enable an examination of the distortion of the recoil\nelectron spectrum that is dominated by the neutrino flavor transformation in\nthe dense solar matter, which will shed new light on the tension between the\nmeasured electron spectra and the predictions of the standard three-flavor\nneutrino oscillation framework. If $\\Delta\nm^{2}_{21}=4.8\\times10^{-5}~(7.5\\times10^{-5})$~eV$^{2}$, JUNO can provide\nevidence of neutrino oscillation in the Earth at the about\n3$\\sigma$~(2$\\sigma$) level by measuring the non-zero signal rate variation\nwith respect to the solar zenith angle. Moveover, JUNO can simultaneously\nmeasure $\\Delta m^2_{21}$ using $^8$B solar neutrinos to a precision of 20\\% or\nbetter depending on the central value and to sub-percent precision using\nreactor antineutrinos. A comparison of these two measurements from the same\ndetector will help elucidate the current tension between the value of $\\Delta\nm^2_{21}$ reported by solar neutrino experiments and the KamLAND experiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Jun 2020 10:36:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-24"}

Since more images are shared on social media than ever before, recent\nresearch focused on the extraction of flood-related posts by analyzing images\nin addition to texts.

This includes the analysis of the bright group members (mB < 16\nmag) and the intra-group light (IGL). The main objective of this work is to\ninvestigate the assembly history of the Fornax A group and to compare its\nphysical quantities as a function of the environment to that of the Fornax\ncluster core. For all galaxies, we extract the azimuthally averaged surface\nbrightness profiles in three optical bands (g, r, i) by modelling the galaxy's\nisophotes. We derive their colour profiles and structural parameters in all\nrespective bands. The long integration time and large covered area of the FDS\nallow us to also estimate the amount of IGL. The majority of galaxies in the\nFornax A group are late-type galaxies (LTGs), spanning a range of stellar mass\nof $8 < log (M_* M_{\\odot}) < 10.5$. Six out of nine LTGs show a Type III\n(up-bending) break in their light profiles, which is either suggestive of\nstrangulation halting star-formation in their outskirts or their HI-richness\ncausing enhanced star-formation in their outer-discs. The estimated luminosity\nof the IGL is $6 \\pm 2 \\times 10^{10} L_{\\odot}$ in g-band, which corresponds\nto about 16% of the total light in the group.

The necessary capability can\noften be provided by well-resolved large eddy simulation (LES), but, for many\nflows of interest, such simulations are too computationally intensive to be\nperformed routinely. In principle, hybrid RANS/LES (HRL) models capable of\ntransitioning through arbitrary levels of modeled and resolved turbulence would\nameliorate both RANS deficiencies and LES expense. However, these HRL\napproaches have led to a host of unique complications, in addition to those\nalready present in RANS and LES. This work proposes a modeling approach aimed\nat overcoming such challenges. The approach presented here relies on splitting\nthe turbulence model into three distinct components: two responsible for the\nstandard subgrid model roles of either providing the unresolved stress or\ndissipation and a third which reduces the model length scale by creating\nresolved turbulence. This formulation renders blending functions unnecessary in\nHRL. Further, the split-model approach both reduces the physics-approximation\nburden on simple eddy-viscosity-based models and provides convenient\nflexibility in model selection. In regions where the resolution is adequate to\nsupport additional turbulence, fluctuations are generated at the smallest\nlocally resolved scales of motion. This active forcing drives the system\ntowards a balance between RANS and grid-resolved LES for any combination of\nresolution and flow while the split-model formulation prevents local disruption\nto the total stress. The model is demonstrated on fully-developed,\nincompressible channel flow [1] and the periodic hill [2], in which it is shown\nto produce accurate results and avoid common HRL shortcomings, such as model\nstress depletion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Jun 2020 02:49:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Dec 2021 22:22:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-20"}

Concretely, the goal is to generate drug-like molecules that are\nscored highly by SMINA, a popular docking software. We observe that popular\ngraph-based generative models fail to generate molecules with a high docking\nscore when trained using a realistically sized training set. This suggests a\nlimitation of the current incarnation of models for de novo drug design.\nFinally, we propose a simplified version of the benchmark based on a simpler\nscoring function, and show that the tested models are able to partially solve\nit. We release the benchmark as an easy to use package available at\nhttps://github.com/cieplinski-tobiasz/smina-docking-benchmark. We hope that our\nbenchmark will serve as a stepping stone towards the goal of automatically\ngenerating promising drug candidates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Jun 2020 16:40:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2020 00:30:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 28 Dec 2020 08:10:50 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 28 Jun 2021 08:21:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-29"}

Machine learning-based predictors for these tasks rely on\nsupervised training that models the behavior of the annotators, i.e., what\nwould the average person's judgement be for an image? A key open question for\nthis type of work, especially for applications where inconsistency with human\nbehavior can lead to ethical lapses, is how to evaluate the epistemic\nuncertainty of trained predictors, i.e., the uncertainty that comes from the\npredictor's model. We propose a Bayesian framework for evaluating black box\npredictors in this regime, agnostic to the predictor's internal structure. The\nframework specifies how to estimate the epistemic uncertainty that comes from\nthe predictor with respect to human labels by approximating a conditional\ndistribution and producing a credible interval for the predictions and their\nmeasures of performance. The framework is successfully applied to four image\nclassification tasks that use subjective human judgements: facial beauty\nassessment, social attribute assignment, apparent age estimation, and ambiguous\nscene labeling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Jun 2020 18:35:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Sep 2021 22:05:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-23"}

Until\nnow, it has limited the output power of sub-micron LEDs and lasers to nanowatt\nrange. Here we present a fin p-n junction LED pixel that eliminates efficiency\ndroop, allowing LEDs brightness to increase linearly with injected current.\nWith record current densities of 1000 KA/cm2 (100 mA), the LEDs transition to\nlasing within the fin, with high brightness. Despite a light extraction\nefficiency of only 15%, these devices exceed the output power of any previous\nelectrically-driven sub-micron LED or laser pixel by 100 to 1000 times, while\nshowing comparable external quantum efficiencies. Modeling suggests that\nspreading of the electron-hole recombination region in fin LEDs at high\ninjection levels suppresses the non-radiative Auger recombination processes.\nFurther refinement of this design is expected to enable development of a new\ngeneration of high brightness electrically addressable LED and laser pixels for\nmacro- and micro-scale applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Jun 2020 01:04:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-21"}
