A critical issue is the lack of thermal\nstability of raw HTL biocrudes at the severe conditions (~400 {\\deg}C) required\nfor hydrodenitrogenation. This fact suggests the need for a two-stage approach,\ninvolving a first low-temperature stabilization stage followed by another one\noperated at higher temperature. In this study, DSC was successfully used to\nindicate the thermal stability of both biocrudes. During hydrotreating, it was\nobserved that complete deoxygenation was already achieved in the first stage at\n350 {\\deg}C, with limited coke formation. Moreover, after second stage up to\n92% denitrogenation associated with the higher hydrogen consumption (39.9 g kg\n-1 for Spirulina and 36.9 g kg -1 for sewage sludge) was obtained for both\nbiocrudes. Consequently, comparable oil yields but significantly less coke\nyields were recorded during two stage upgrading (1.0% for Spirulina and 0.7%\nfor sewage sludge), compared to direct processing at 400 {\\deg}C (9.1% for\nSpirulina and 3.4% for sewage sludge).

Software-defined radio (SDR), by allowing wireless\nsignal processing on a personal computer (PC), has been widely used for such\nquick prototyping efforts. Unfortunately, because of the \\textit{uncontrollable\ndelay} between the PC and the radio board, SDR is generally deemed not suitable\nfor time-sensitive wireless applications that demand communication with low and\ndeterministic latency.

To this end, we designed and implemented a time-slotted\nwireless system on the Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) SDR platform.\nWe developed a time synchronization mechanism to maintain synchrony among nodes\nin the system. To reduce the delays and delay jitters between the USRP board\nand its PC, we devised a {\\textit{Just-in-time}} algorithm to ensure that\npackets sent by the PC to the USRP can reach the USRP just before the time\nslots they are to be transmitted.

While praised for its\nclean syntax and C-like performance, Go also contains a strong static\ntype-system that prevents arbitrary type casting and arbitrary memory access,\nmaking the language type-safe by design. However, to give developers the\npossibility of implementing low-level code, Go ships with a special package\ncalled unsafe that offers developers a way around the type-safety of Go\nprograms. The package gives greater flexibility to developers but comes at a\nhigher risk of runtime errors, chances of non-portability, and the loss of\ncompatibility guarantees for future versions of Go.\n  In this paper, we present the first large-scale study on the usage of the\nunsafe package in 2,438 popular Go projects. Our investigation shows that\nunsafe is used in 24% of Go projects, motivated primarily by communicating with\noperating systems and C code, but is also commonly used as a source of\nperformance optimization. Developers are willing to use unsafe to break\nlanguage specifications (e.g., string immutability) for better performance and\n6% of analyzed projects that use unsafe perform risky pointer conversions that\ncan lead to program crashes and unexpected behavior. Furthermore, we report a\nseries of real issues faced by projects that use unsafe, from crashing errors\nand non-deterministic behavior to having their deployment restricted from\ncertain popular environments. Our findings can be used to understand how and\nwhy developers break type-safety in Go, and help motivate further tools and\nlanguage development that could make the usage of unsafe in Go even safer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jun 2020 16:38:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 03:57:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2021 01:34:11 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 22 Jul 2021 18:51:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-12"}

The conditional logit model is\nsimplistic, but it is particularly attractive because it allows for efficient\nconsistent likelihood maximization via negative sampling, something that isn't\ntrue for mixed logit and many other richer models. The value of negative\nsampling is particularly pronounced because choice sets in relational data are\noften enormous.\n  Given the importance of negative sampling, in this work we introduce a model\nsimplification technique for mixed logit models that we call \"de-mixing\",\nwhereby standard mixture models of network formation---particularly models that\nmix local and global link formation---are reformulated to operate their modes\nover disjoint choice sets. This reformulation reduces mixed logit models to\nconditional logit models, opening the door to negative sampling while also\ncircumventing other standard challenges with maximizing mixture model\nlikelihoods. To further improve scalability, we also study importance sampling\nfor more efficiently selecting negative samples, finding that it can greatly\nspeed up inference in both standard and de-mixed models. Together, these steps\nmake it possible to much more realistically model network formation in very\nlarge graphs. We illustrate the relative gains of our improvements on synthetic\ndatasets with known ground truth as well as a large-scale dataset of public\ntransactions on the Venmo platform.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jun 2020 17:08:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-18"}

In order to satisfy the X-ray constraint, the ALP coupling to\nphotons must be significantly suppressed compared to that to electrons.

Compared to traditional travel\nsurveys, MDLD has larger spatiotemporal coverage of population and its\nmobility. However, ground truth information such as trip origins and\ndestinations, travel modes, and trip purposes are not included by default. Such\nimportant attributes must be imputed to maximize the usefulness of the data.\nThis paper tends to study the capability of MDLD on estimating travel mode\nshare at aggregated levels. A data-driven framework is proposed to extract\ntravel behavior information from the MDLD. The proposed framework first\nidentifies trip ends with a modified Spatiotemporal Density-based Spatial\nClustering of Applications with Noise (ST-DBSCAN) algorithm. Then three types\nof features are extracted for each trip to impute travel modes using machine\nlearning models. A labeled MDLD dataset with ground truth information is used\nto train the proposed models, resulting in 95% accuracy in identifying trip\nends and 93% accuracy in imputing five travel modes (drive, rail, bus, bike and\nwalk) with a Random Forest (RF) classifier. The proposed framework is then\napplied to two large-scale MDLD datasets, covering the Baltimore-Washington\nmetropolitan area and the United States, respectively. The estimated trip\ndistance, trip time, trip rate distribution, and travel mode share are compared\nagainst travel surveys at different geographies. The results suggest that the\nproposed framework can be readily applied in different states and metropolitan\nregions with low cost in order to study multimodal travel demand, understand\nmobility trends, and support decision making.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jun 2020 17:57:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Jun 2020 20:13:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 27 Dec 2020 19:55:42 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2021 16:04:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-31"}

Inside a cavity of fixed size\n$r$ and fixed temperature $T$, there is a threshold at $\\pi r T = 1$ above\nwhich a black hole can be in thermal equilibrium. This thermal equilibrium can\nbe achieved for two specific black holes, a small black hole of horizon radius\n$r_{+1}$, and a large black hole of radius $r_{+2}$. In five dimensions, the\nradii $r_{+1}$ and $r_{+2}$ have an exact expression. Through the path integral\nformalism and the partition function, one obtains the action and the free\nenergy. This leads to the thermal energy and entropy of the system, the latter\nturning out to be given by the Bekenstein-Hawking area law $S =\n\\frac{A_{+}}{4}$, where $A_+$ is the black hole's surface area. The heat\ncapacity is positive when the heat bath is placed at a radius $r$ that is equal\nor less than the photonic orbit, implying thermodynamic stability. This means\nthat the small black hole is unstable and the large one is stable. A\ngeneralized free energy is used to show that it is feasible that classical hot\nflat space transits through $r_{+1}$ to settle at the stable $r_{+2}$.\nRemarkably, the free energy of the larger $r_{+2}$ black hole is zero when the\ncavity radius is equal to the Buchdahl radius.

Through the development of a perturbative model, we find that the\nmark induces a significant coupling between non-Gaussianities, which are\nusually found on small scales, and large scales, leading to the additional\ninformation content. The model is derived in the context of one-loop\nperturbation theory and validated by comparison to $N$-body simulations across\na variety of mark parameters. At moderate redshifts, including for massive\nneutrino cosmologies, the theory is in good agreement with the simulations. The\nimportance of non-linear gravitational effects on the large-scale spectra\ncomplicates the modeling as there is no well-defined convergence radius of the\ntheory at low $z$. Extension to higher perturbative order and biased tracers is\npossible via a similar approach, and a simple model of the latter is shown to\nyield promising results.

For the perturbed FLRW spacetime,\nwe show how our results recover or relate to the more typical effective local\ntreatment of energy in cosmology, with a view towards better studying the\nissues of the cosmological constant and of cosmological back-reactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jun 2020 18:00:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Oct 2020 17:20:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2021 13:07:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-27"}

The nematode \\textit{C. elegans}\nis an ideal model organism for studying locomotion in an integrated\nneuromechanical setting because its neural circuit has a well-characterized\nmodular structure and its undulatory forward swimming gait adapts to the\nsurrounding fluid with a shorter wavelength in higher viscosity environments.\nThis adaptive behavior emerges from the neural modules interacting through a\ncombination of mechanical forces, neuronal coupling, and sensory feedback\nmechanisms. However, the relative contributions of these coupling modes to gait\nadaptation are not understood. The model consists of repeated neuromechanical\nmodules that are coupled through the mechanics of the body, short-range\nproprioception, and gap-junctions. The model captures the experimentally\nobserved gait adaptation over a wide range of mechanical parameters, provided\nthat the muscle response to input from the nervous system is faster than the\nbody response to changes in internal and external forces. The modularity of the\nmodel allows the use of the theory of weakly coupled oscillators to identify\nthe relative roles of body mechanics, gap-junctional coupling, and\nproprioceptive coupling in coordinating the undulatory gait. The analysis shows\nthat the wavelength of body undulations is set by the relative strengths of\nthese three coupling forms. In a low-viscosity fluid environment, the\ncompetition between gap-junctions and proprioception produces a long wavelength\nundulation, which is only achieved in the model with sufficiently strong\ngap-junctional coupling.The experimentally observed decrease in wavelength in\nresponse to increasing fluid viscosity is the result of an increase in the\nrelative strength of mechanical coupling, which promotes a short wavelength.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jun 2020 19:48:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Oct 2020 23:51:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2021 20:51:01 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 16 Mar 2021 19:15:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-08"}

Our hybrid Newton/Gradient Descent (NGD) method is consistent\nwith the interpretation of hidden layers as providing an adaptive basis and the\nlinear layer as providing an optimal fit of the basis to data. By alternating\nbetween a second-order method to find globally optimal parameters for the\nlinear layer and gradient descent to train the hidden layers, we ensure an\noptimal fit of the adaptive basis to data throughout training. The size of the\nHessian in the second-order step scales only with the number weights in the\nlinear layer and not the depth and width of the hidden layers; furthermore, the\napproach is applicable to arbitrary hidden layer architecture.

Simultaneously, there are increasing interests\nin generalizing deep learning to the graph domain in the form of graph neural\nnetworks (GNNs). GNNs can naturally utilize unlabeled nodes through the simple\nneighborhood aggregation that is unable to thoroughly make use of unlabeled\nnodes.

On the other hand, it\nprovides rich information that enables us to build SSL from a variety of\nperspectives. Thus, in this paper, we first deepen our understandings on when,\nwhy, and which strategies of SSL work with GNNs by empirically studying\nnumerous basic SSL pretext tasks on graphs. Inspired by deep insights from the\nempirical studies, we propose a new direction SelfTask to build advanced\npretext tasks that are able to achieve state-of-the-art performance on various\nreal-world datasets. The specific experimental settings to reproduce our\nresults can be found in \\url{https://github.com/ChandlerBang/SelfTask-GNN}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jun 2020 20:30:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-19"}

Previous studies attributed various\ntransient phenomena in Io's environment and Jupiter's magnetosphere to a sudden\nchange in the mass loss from the atmosphere supposedly triggered by a change in\nvolcanic activity. Since the gas in volcanic plumes does not escape directly,\nsuch causal correlation would require a transient volcano-induced change in\natmospheric abundance, which has never been observed so far. Here we report\nfour observations of atmospheric SO2 and NaCl obtained with the IRAM NOEMA\ninterferometer. These observations are compared to measurements of volcanic hot\nspots and Io's neutral and plasma environment. We find a stable NaCl column\ndensity in Io's atmosphere. The SO2 column density derived for December 2016 is\nabout 30% lower compared to the period of March to April 2017. This increase in\nSO2 from December 2016 to March 2017 might be related to increasing volcanic\nactivity observed at several sites in spring 2017, but the stability of the\nvolcanic trace gas NaCl and resulting decrease in NaCl/SO2 ratio do not support\nthis interpretation. Observed dimmings in both the sulfur ion torus and Na\nneutral cloud suggest rather a decrease in mass loading in the period of\nincreasing SO2 abundance. The dimming Na brightness and stable atmospheric NaCl\nfurthermore dispute an earlier suggested positive correlation of the sodium\ncloud and the hot spot activity at Loki Patara, which considerably increased in\nthis period. The environment of Io overall appears to be in a quiescent state,\npreventing further conclusions.

Here, inspired by a method developed for a single brain area, we\nintroduce a new technique for demixing variables across multiple brain areas,\ncalled demixed shared component analysis (dSCA). dSCA decomposes population\nactivity into a few components, such that the shared components capture the\nmaximum amount of shared information across brain regions while also depending\non relevant task parameters. This yields interpretable components that express\nwhich variables are shared between different brain regions and when this\ninformation is shared across time. To illustrate our method, we reanalyze two\ndatasets recorded during decision-making tasks in rodents and macaques. We find\nthat dSCA provides new insights into the shared computation between different\nbrain areas in these datasets, relating to several different aspects of\ndecision formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jun 2020 00:13:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Oct 2020 10:24:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-27"}

To this end, we first propose a novel stochastic\nprocess, called Class-Attentive Diffusion (CAD), that strengthens attention to\nintra-class nodes and attenuates attention to inter-class nodes. In contrast to\nthe existing diffusion methods with a transition matrix determined solely by\nthe graph structure, CAD considers both the node features and the graph\nstructure with the design of our class-attentive transition matrix that\nutilizes a classifier.

Under certain circumstances, large axion fluctuations\nin the early universe can collapse to form dense configurations called axion\nclumps. The densest axion clumps are metastable states known as oscillons. In\nthis paper we propose a new class of observables that exploit the axion's\ncoupling to photons. As a result of this coupling an axion clump acts like an\ninhomogeneous refractive optical medium -- a lens -- that causes anomalous\ndispersion of incident electromagnetic waves. The dispersion of electromagnetic\nwaves by axion clumps clearly distinguishes this lensing effect from\ngravitational lensing. Axion clumps passing in front of background radio\nsources act as lenses and lead to apparent positional shifts that can\npotentially be discovered by high-precision radio astrometry missions with the\nforthcoming Square Kilometer Array (SKA).

Temporal dynamic interactions can be described by\n(multiple) geometric trajectories in a suitable space over which unsupervised\nlearning techniques may be applied to extract useful features from raw and\nhigh-dimensional data measurements. Taking a geometric approach to robust\nrepresentation learning for temporal dynamic interactions, it is necessary to\ndevelop suitable metrics and a systematic methodology for comparison and for\nassessing the stability of an unsupervised learning method with respect to its\ntuning parameters. Such metrics must account for the (geometric) constraints in\nthe physical world as well as the uncertainty associated with the learned\npatterns.

HSR aims at fusing a pair of hyperspectral and\nmultispectral images to recover a super-resolution image (SRI). The vast\nmajority of the HSR approaches take a low-rank matrix recovery perspective. The\nchallenge is that theoretical guarantees for recovering the SRI using low-rank\nmatrix models are either elusive or derived under stringent conditions. A\ncouple of recent CTD-based methods ensure recoverability for the SRI under\nrelatively mild conditions, leveraging on algebraic properties of the canonical\npolyadic decomposition (CPD) and the Tucker decomposition models, respectively.\nHowever, the latent factors of both the CPD and Tucker models have no physical\ninterpretations in the context of spectral image analysis, which makes\nincorporating prior information challenging---but using priors is often\nessential for enhancing performance in noisy environments. This work employs an\nidea that models spectral images as tensors following the block-term\ndecomposition model with multilinear rank-$(L_r, L_r, 1)$ terms (i.e., the LL1\nmodel) and formulates the HSR problem as a coupled LL1 tensor decomposition\nproblem. Similar to the existing CTD approaches, recoverability of the SRI is\nshown under mild conditions. More importantly, the latent factors of the LL1\nmodel can be interpreted as the key constituents of spectral images, i.e., the\nendmembers' spectral signatures and abundance maps.

The spring produces a fluctuating tensile force on the\nfilament, whose value depends on the filament's instantaneous end-to-end\nlength. The spring thereby introduces a nonlinearity, which mixes the\nundulatory normal modes of the filament and changes their dynamics. We study\nthese dynamics using the Martin-Siggia-Rose-Janssen-de-Domincis formalism, and\ncompute the time-dependent correlation functions of transverse undulations and\nof the filament's end-to-end distance. The relaxational dynamics of the modes\nbelow a characteristic wavelength $\\sqrt{\\kappa/\\tau_R}$, set by the filament's\nbending modulus $\\kappa$ and spring-renormalized tension $\\tau_{R}$, are\nchanged by the boundary spring. This occurs near the cross-over frequency\nbetween tension- and bending-dominated modes of the system. The boundary spring\ncan be used to represent the linear elastic compliance of the rest of the\nfilament network to which the filament is cross-linked.

The cross-modality distribution of the spatial and spectral\ninformation makes the problem challenging. Inspired by the classic wavelet\ndecomposition-based image fusion, we propose a novel \\textit{lightweight} deep\nneural network-based framework, namely progressive zero-centric residual\nnetwork (PZRes-Net), to address this problem efficiently and effectively.\nSpecifically, PZRes-Net learns a high resolution and \\textit{zero-centric}\nresidual image, which contains high-frequency spatial details of the scene\nacross all spectral bands, from both inputs in a progressive fashion along the\nspectral dimension. And the resulting residual image is then superimposed onto\nthe up-sampled LR-HSI in a \\textit{mean-value invariant} manner, leading to a\ncoarse HR-HSI, which is further refined by exploring the coherence across all\nspectral bands simultaneously.

This effect has\noften been ascribed to the actions of kinetic microinstabilities because the\ndistribution of observational data aligns with contours of constant instability\ngrowth rates in the beta-anisotropy plane. However, the linear Vlasov theory of\ninstabilities assumes a uniform background in which perturbations grow. The\nestablished success of linear-microinstability theories suggests that the\nconditions in regions of extreme temperature anisotropy may remain uniform for\na long enough time so that the instabilities have the chance to grow to\nsufficient amplitude. Turbulence, on the other hand, is intrinsically\nnon-uniform and non-linear. Thin current sheets and other coherent structures\ngenerated in a turbulent plasma, may destroy the uniformity fast enough. It is\ntherefore not a-priori obvious whether the presence of intermittency and\ncoherent structures favors or disfavors instabilities. To address this\nquestion, we examined the statistical distribution of growth rates associated\nwith proton temperature-anisotropy driven microinstabilities and local\nnonlinear time scales in turbulent plasmas. Linear growth rates are, on\naverage, substantially less than the local nonlinear rates.

One direct threat to it is GPS spoofing, but fortunately, AV\nsystems today predominantly use Multi-Sensor Fusion (MSF) algorithms that are\ngenerally believed to have the potential to practically defeat GPS spoofing.\nHowever, no prior work has studied whether today's MSF algorithms are indeed\nsufficiently secure under GPS spoofing, especially in AV settings. In this\nwork, we perform the first study to fill this critical gap. As the first study,\nwe focus on a production-grade MSF with both design and implementation level\nrepresentativeness, and identify two AV-specific attack goals, off-road and\nwrong-way attacks.\n  To systematically understand the security property, we first analyze the\nupper-bound attack effectiveness, and discover a take-over effect that can\nfundamentally defeat the MSF design principle. We perform a cause analysis and\nfind that such vulnerability only appears dynamically and\nnon-deterministically. Leveraging this insight, we design FusionRipper, a novel\nand general attack that opportunistically captures and exploits take-over\nvulnerabilities. We evaluate it on 6 real-world sensor traces, and find that\nFusionRipper can achieve at least 97% and 91.3% success rates in all traces for\noff-road and wrong-way attacks respectively. We also find that it is highly\nrobust to practical factors such as spoofing inaccuracies. To improve the\npracticality, we further design an offline method that can effectively identify\nattack parameters with over 80% average success rates for both attack goals,\nwith the cost of at most half a day. We also discuss promising defense\ndirections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jun 2020 07:20:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2020 18:18:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 12 Aug 2020 17:14:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-13"}

Such\nobjects as hard distractors, even though being the minority among negative\nsamples, increase the risk of target drift and model corruption, which deserve\nadditional attention in online tracking and model update. To enhance the\ntracking robustness, in this paper, we propose a cascaded regression tracker\nwith two sequential stages. In the first stage, we filter out abundant\neasily-identified negative candidates via an efficient convolutional\nregression. In the second stage, a discrete sampling based ridge regression is\ndesigned to double-check the remaining ambiguous hard samples, which serves as\nan alternative of fully-connected layers and benefits from the closed-form\nsolver for efficient learning.

Existing algorithms usually extract visual\nfeatures using off-the-shelf Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and late fuse\nthe visual and non-visual features for the finally predicted CTR. Despite being\nextensively studied, this field still face two key challenges. First, although\nencouraging progress has been made in offline studies, applying CNNs in real\nsystems remains non-trivial, due to the strict requirements for efficient\nend-to-end training and low-latency online serving. Second, the off-the-shelf\nCNNs and late fusion architectures are suboptimal. Specifically, off-the-shelf\nCNNs were designed for classification thus never take categories as input\nfeatures. While in e-commerce, categories are precisely labeled and contain\nabundant visual priors that will help the visual modeling. Unaware of the ad\ncategory, these CNNs may extract some unnecessary category-unrelated features,\nwasting CNN's limited expression ability. To overcome the two challenges, we\npropose Category-specific CNN (CSCNN) specially for CTR prediction.

The QGP medium formed in the collisions is assumed to evolve under\n($3+1$)-dimensional relativistic viscous hydrodynamics which is modeled using\nECHO-QGP.

After that, we\nintroduce the definitions of $ \\mathbb{Z}_2 $ topological invariants for\nbosonic systems with pseudo-time-reversal symmetry, which ensures the existence\nof bosonic counterparts of \"Kramers pairs\". Because of the intrinsic\nnon-Hermiticity of the bosonic BdG systems, these topological invariants have\nto be defined in terms of the bosonic Berry connection and curvature. We then\nintroduce theoretical models that can be thought of as magnonic analogues of\ntwo- and three-dimensional topological insulators in class AII. We demonstrate\nanalytically and numerically that the $ \\mathbb{Z}_2 $ topological invariants\nprecisely characterize the presence of gapless edge/surface states. We also\npredict that bilayer CrI$_3$ with a particular stacking would be an ideal\ncandidate for realization of a two-dimensional magnon system characterized by a\nnontrivial $ \\mathbb{Z}_2 $ topological invariant. For three-dimensional\ntopological magnon systems, the thermal Hall effect of magnons is expected to\noccur when a magnetic field is applied to the surface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jun 2020 09:50:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 3 Oct 2020 11:41:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 31 Mar 2021 11:38:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-15"}

In terms of\nintracellular transport, motor proteins use the cytoskeletal filaments as a\nbackbone along which they can actively transport biological cargos such as\nvesicles carrying biochemical reactants. Crossings between such filaments\nconstitute a key element, as they may serve to alter the destination of such\npayload. Although motor proteins are known to display a rich behaviour at such\ncrossings, the latter have so far only been modelled as simple branching\npoints.

Instead, it gives rise to entirely new\nand counterintuitive features: the fundamental current-density relation for\ntraffic flow is no longer a single-valued function, and it furthermore differs\naccording to whether it is observed upstream or downstream from the crossing.\nWe argue that these novel features may be directly relevant for interpreting\nexperimental measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jun 2020 10:46:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-20"}

Modern time series collected from sensor\nnetworks (e.g., energy consumption and traffic flow) are often large-scale and\nincomplete with considerable corruption and missing values, making it difficult\nto perform accurate predictions. In this paper, we propose a low-rank\nautoregressive tensor completion (LATC) framework to model multivariate time\nseries data. The key of LATC is to transform the original multivariate time\nseries matrix (e.g., sensor$\\times$time point) to a third-order tensor\nstructure (e.g., sensor$\\times$time of day$\\times$day) by introducing an\nadditional temporal dimension, which allows us to model the inherent rhythms\nand seasonality of time series as global patterns. With the tensor structure,\nwe can transform the time series prediction and missing data imputation\nproblems into a universal low-rank tensor completion problem. Besides\nminimizing tensor rank, we also integrate a novel autoregressive norm on the\noriginal matrix representation into the objective function. The two components\nserve different roles. The low-rank structure allows us to effectively capture\nthe global consistency and trends across all the three dimensions (i.e.,\nsimilarity among sensors, similarity of different days, and current time v.s.\nthe same time of historical days). The autoregressive norm can better model the\nlocal temporal trends. Our numerical experiments on three real-world data sets\ndemonstrate the superiority of the integration of global and local trends in\nLATC in both missing data imputation and rolling prediction tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jun 2020 11:31:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-19"}

We simulate a two-dimensional system of hard disks\nsuspended in a solution of dense hard needles as a model system for colloids\nsuspended in a nematic lyotropic liquid crystal. The novel event-chain Monte\nCarlo technique enables us to directly measure colloidal interactions in a\nmicroscopic simulation with explicit liquid crystal particles in the dense\nnematic phase. We find a directional short-range attraction for disks along the\ndirector, which triggers chaining parallel to the director and seemingly\ncontradicts the standard liquid crystal field theory result of a quadrupolar\nattraction with a preferred ${45^{\\circ}}$ angle. Our results can be explained\nby a short-range density-dependent depletion interaction, which has been\nneglected so far. Directionality and strength of the depletion interaction are\ncaused by the weak planar anchoring of hard rods. The depletion attraction\nrobustly dominates over the quadrupolar elastic attraction if disks come close.\nSelf-assembly of many disks proceeds via intermediate chaining, which\ndemonstrates that in lyotropic liquid crystal colloids depletion interactions\nplay an important role in structure formation processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jun 2020 12:11:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-30"}

While the effects of doping and disorder have\nbeen well studied in B20 metallic materials such as Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$Si and\nMn$_{1-x}$Fe$_x$Si, the consequences of chemical substitution in the\nmagnetoelectric insulator Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$ have not been fully explored.

The results demonstrate that the first order\nhelical-conical phase transition exhibits two thermally separated behavioural\nregimes: at high temperatures, the helimagnetic domains transform by\nlarge-scale, continuous rotations, while at low temperatures, the two phases\ncoexist. Remarkably, the effects of pinning in the substituted sample are less\nprevalent at low temperatures, compared to high temperatures, despite the\nreduction of available thermal activation energy.

Due to the quantum coupling between the twisted atomic\nlayers, light-matter interaction is inherently chiral; as such, they provide a\npromising platform for chiral plasmons in the extreme nanoscale. However, while\nthe interlayer quantum coupling can be significant, its influence on chiral\nplasmons still remains elusive.

Importantly, such a unique phase relationship for chiral plasmons\ncan be exploited to construct the missing longitudinal spin of plasmons,\nbesides the common transverse spin of plasmons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jun 2020 12:44:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-19"}

Self-supervised learning (SSL) can help in this regard by providing a\nstrategy to pre-train a neural network with unlabeled data, followed by\nfine-tuning for a downstream task with limited annotations. Contrastive\nlearning, a particular variant of SSL, is a powerful technique for learning\nimage-level representations. In this work, we propose strategies for extending\nthe contrastive learning framework for segmentation of volumetric medical\nimages in the semi-supervised setting with limited annotations, by leveraging\ndomain-specific and problem-specific cues. Specifically, we propose (1) novel\ncontrasting strategies that leverage structural similarity across volumetric\nmedical images (domain-specific cue) and (2) a local version of the contrastive\nloss to learn distinctive representations of local regions that are useful for\nper-pixel segmentation (problem-specific cue). We carry out an extensive\nevaluation on three Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) datasets. In the limited\nannotation setting, the proposed method yields substantial improvements\ncompared to other self-supervision and semi-supervised learning techniques.\nWhen combined with a simple data augmentation technique, the proposed method\nreaches within 8% of benchmark performance using only two labeled MRI volumes\nfor training, corresponding to only 4% (for ACDC) of the training data used to\ntrain the benchmark.

NGP decomposes the\nimage into a set of interpretable appearance feature maps, uncovering direct\ncontrol handles for controllable image generation. To form an image, NGP\ngenerates coarse 3D models that are fed into neural rendering modules to\nproduce view-specific interpretable 2D maps, which are then composited into the\nfinal output image using a traditional image formation model. Our approach\noffers control over image generation by providing direct handles controlling\nillumination and camera parameters, in addition to control over shape and\nappearance variations.

The\nquestion whether Clever Hans also occurs in unsupervised learning, and in which\nform, has received so far almost no attention. Therefore, this paper will\ncontribute an explainable AI (XAI) procedure that can highlight the relevant\nfeatures used by popular anomaly detection models of different type. Our\nanalysis reveals that the Clever Hans effect is widespread in anomaly detection\nand occurs in many (unexpected) forms. Interestingly, the observed Clever Hans\neffects are in this case not so much due to the data, but due to the anomaly\ndetection models themselves whose structure makes them unable to detect the\ntruly relevant features, even though vast amounts of data points are available.\nOverall, our work contributes a warning against an unrestrained use of existing\nanomaly detection models in practical applications, but it also points at a\npossible way out of the Clever Hans dilemma, specifically, by allowing multiple\nanomaly models to mutually cancel their individual structural weaknesses to\njointly produce a better and more trustworthy anomaly detector.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jun 2020 15:27:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-19"}

Here, we explore the use of in-the-wild\nimages, and images from non-specialized face databases, to train one-class\nclassifiers for face anti-spoofing. Employing a well-established technique, we\ntrain a convolutional autoencoder on real faces and compare the reconstruction\nerror of the input against a threshold to classify a face image accordingly as\neither client or imposter.\n  Our results show that the inclusion in the training set of in-the-wild images\nincreases the discriminating power of the classifier significantly on an unseen\ndatabase, as evidenced by a large increase in the value of the Area Under the\nCurve. In a limitation of our approach, we note that the problem of finding a\nsuitable operating point on the unseen database remains a challenge, as\nevidenced by the values of the Half Total Error Rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jun 2020 15:49:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-19"}

For\nthat, we implement the observed solar XUV radiation available over one and a\nhalf solar cycles in a 1D hydrodynamic escape model of HD209458b. We find that\natmospheric escape rates show a cyclic variation (from 7.6 to 18.5 $\\times$\n10$^{10}$ g s$^{-1}$), almost proportional to the incident stellar radiation.\nTo compare this with observations, we compute spectroscopic transits in two\nhydrogen lines.

We complement these efforts by introducing a novel class of\nadversarial attacks---training-resistant attacks---which can disrupt\nface-swapping autoencoders whether or not its adversarial images have been\nincluded in the training set of said autoencoders. We propose the Oscillating\nGAN (OGAN) attack, a novel attack optimized to be training-resistant, which\nintroduces spatial-temporal distortions to the output of face-swapping\nautoencoders. To implement OGAN, we construct a bilevel optimization problem,\nwhere we train a generator and a face-swapping model instance against each\nother. Specifically, we pair each input image with a target distortion, and\nfeed them into a generator that produces an adversarial image. This image will\nexhibit the distortion when a face-swapping autoencoder is applied to it. We\nsolve the optimization problem by training the generator and the face-swapping\nmodel simultaneously using an iterative process of alternating optimization.\nNext, we analyze the previously published Distorting Attack and show it is\ntraining-resistant, though it is outperformed by our suggested OGAN. Finally,\nwe validate both attacks using a popular implementation of FaceSwap, and show\nthat they transfer across different target models and target faces, including\nfaces the adversarial attacks were not trained on.

A Frost Filtered Scale-Invariant\nFeature Transformation based MultiLayer Perceptron Classification (FFSIFT-MLPC)\ntechnique is introduced for classifying the hyperspectral image with higher\naccuracy and minimum time consumption. The FFSIFT-MLPC technique performs three\nmajor processes, namely preprocessing, feature extraction and classification\nusing multiple layers. Initially, the hyperspectral image is divided into\nnumber of spectral bands. These bands are given as input in the input layer of\nperceptron. Then the Frost filter is used in FFSIFT-MLPC technique for\npreprocessing the input bands which helps to remove the noise from\nhyper-spectral image at the first hidden layer. After preprocessing task,\ntexture, color and object features of hyper-spectral image are extracted at\nsecond hidden layer using Gaussian distributive scale-invariant feature\ntransform. At the third hidden layer, Euclidean distance is measured between\nthe extracted features and testing features. Finally, feature matching is\ncarried out at the output layer for hyper-spectral image classification. The\nclassified outputs are resulted in terms of spectral bands (i.e., different\ncolors). Experimental analysis is performed with PSNR, classification accuracy,\nfalse positive rate and classification time with number of spectral bands.

This has resulted in concerns about the fairness of\ndecisions made by these models. Various notions and measures of fairness have\nbeen proposed to ensure that a decision-making system does not\ndisproportionately harm (or benefit) particular subgroups of the population. In\nthis paper, we argue that traditional notions of fairness that are only based\non models' outputs are not sufficient when the model is vulnerable to\nadversarial attacks. We argue that in some cases, it may be easier for an\nattacker to target a particular subgroup, resulting in a form of\n\\textit{robustness bias}. We show that measuring robustness bias is a\nchallenging task for DNNs and propose two methods to measure this form of bias.\nWe then conduct an empirical study on state-of-the-art neural networks on\ncommonly used real-world datasets such as CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, Adience, and\nUTKFace and show that in almost all cases there are subgroups (in some cases\nbased on sensitive attributes like race, gender, etc) which are less robust and\nare thus at a disadvantage. We argue that this kind of bias arises due to both\nthe data distribution and the highly complex nature of the learned decision\nboundary in the case of DNNs, thus making mitigation of such biases a\nnon-trivial task.

We\nexplored several algorithms of machine learning using supervised learning to\ndevelop a prediction model and provide informative analysis of future market\nprices. Due to the difficulty of evaluating the exact nature of a Time\nSeries(ARIMA) model, it is often very difficult to produce appropriate\nforecasts. Then we continue to implement Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with\nlong short-term memory cells (LSTM). Thus, we analyzed the time series model\nprediction of bitcoin prices with greater efficiency using long short-term\nmemory (LSTM) techniques and compared the predictability of bitcoin price and\nsentiment analysis of bitcoin tweets to the standard method (ARIMA).

The Frenkel-Kontorova model on hexagonal\nlattice was used. We studied the case of one H atom above the C atom in the\nplane of graphane (we used the approximation of the hexagonal lattice in the\nplane). Continuous limit of the Lagrange-Euler equations is found from the\nHamiltonian for $H$ atoms motion, they enabled us to study kink and breather\nexcitations of $H$ atoms in the $H$ plane above the $C$ plane. We have found\nthat there are three cases in the one $H$ atom motion The case $1$, when the\n$H$ atom is at the position which is below the position at which it is\ndesorbed. Then the motion of this $H$ atom at time $t_{h}$ is described. The\ncase $2$, when the $H$ atom is at the position of the suppressed atom $H$ in\nthe direction to the $C$ (nearer) atom. This $H$ atom will be desorbed from the\ngraphane going through the minimum of the potential energy and then through the\npoint of desorption. Its motion of at time $t_{h}$ is described. The case $3$,\nwhen the $H$ atom is near the position of small oscillations near the potential\nenergy minimum. The position of the atom $H$ at the time $t_{0}$ is the\nposition to which the atom $H$ was excited with external force.

Recent researches abstract\nmolecules as graphs and employ Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for molecular\nrepresentation learning. Nevertheless, two issues impede the usage of GNNs in\nreal scenarios: (1) insufficient labeled molecules for supervised training; (2)\npoor generalization capability to new-synthesized molecules. To address them\nboth, we propose a novel framework, GROVER, which stands for Graph\nRepresentation frOm self-superVised mEssage passing tRansformer. With carefully\ndesigned self-supervised tasks in node-, edge- and graph-level, GROVER can\nlearn rich structural and semantic information of molecules from enormous\nunlabelled molecular data. Rather, to encode such complex information, GROVER\nintegrates Message Passing Networks into the Transformer-style architecture to\ndeliver a class of more expressive encoders of molecules. The flexibility of\nGROVER allows it to be trained efficiently on large-scale molecular dataset\nwithout requiring any supervision, thus being immunized to the two issues\nmentioned above. We pre-train GROVER with 100 million parameters on 10 million\nunlabelled molecules -- the biggest GNN and the largest training dataset in\nmolecular representation learning. We then leverage the pre-trained GROVER for\nmolecular property prediction followed by task-specific fine-tuning, where we\nobserve a huge improvement (more than 6% on average) from current\nstate-of-the-art methods on 11 challenging benchmarks.
