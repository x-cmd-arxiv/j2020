The random K-out graph with $n$ nodes is constructed\nas follows. Each node draws an edge towards $K$ distinct nodes selected\nuniformly at random. The orientation of the edges is then ignored, yielding an\nundirected graph. An interesting property of random K-out graphs is that they\nare connected almost surely in the limit of large $n$ for any $K \\geq2$. This\nmeans that they attain the property of being connected very easily, i.e., with\nfar fewer edges ($O(n)$) as compared to classical random graph models including\nErd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi graphs ($O(n \\log n)$). This work aims to reveal to what\nextent the asymptotic behavior of random K-out graphs being connected easily\nextends to cases where the number $n$ of nodes is small.

This symmetry will impose a new consistency condition,\nnamely, confinement of a $p$-form must imply the localization of its dual. We\napply the above conditions to $6$D braneworlds. With this, we find that in\nglobal string-like defects, for example, the $1$-form has a normalizable\nzero-mode. By using the HD, we show that its bulk dual $3$-form also has a\nnormalizable zero-mode, making the confinement consistent with HD. However,\nthese solutions cannot be made consistent with EE, therefore, these fields must\nbe ruled out. In fact, by imposing both conditions, only the scalar and its\ndual field can be consistently localized. In this way, all the literature so\nfar in which the free $1$-form is localized in codimension two models should be\nreviewed.

Understanding the dependence of the turbulent transport\ntriggered by the shear instabilities due to the differential rotation in\nstellar radiation zones is mandatory. Indeed, it constitutes one of the\ncornerstones of the rotational transport and mixing theory which is implemented\nin stellar evolution codes to predict the rotational and chemical evolutions of\nstars. We investigate horizontal shear instabilities in stellar radiation zones\nby considering the full Coriolis acceleration with both the dimensionless\nhorizontal component $\\tilde{f}$ and the vertical component $f$. We performed a\nlinear stability analysis for a horizontal shear flow with a hyperbolic tangent\nprofile, both numerically and asymptotically using the WKBJ approximation. As\nin the traditional approximation, we identified the inflectional and inertial\ninstabilities. The inflectional instability is destabilized as $\\tilde{f}$\nincreases and its maximum growth rate increases significantly, while the\nthermal diffusivity stabilizes the inflectional instability similarly to the\ntraditional case. The inertial instability is also strongly affected; for\ninstance, the inertially unstable regime is extended in the non-diffusive limit\nas $0<f<1+\\tilde{f}^{2}/N^{2}$, where $N$ is the dimensionless\nBrunt-V\\\"ais\\\"al\\\"a frequency. More strikingly, in the high-thermal-diffusivity\nlimit, it is always inertially unstable at any colatitude $\\theta$ except at\nthe poles (i.e., $0^{\\circ}<\\theta<180^{\\circ}$). Using the asymptotic and\nnumerical results, we propose a prescription for the effective turbulent\nviscosities induced by the instabilities to be possibly used in stellar\nevolution models.

We highlight three distinct temporal\nscaling laws for the transport distance of exhaled material including (i)\ntransport over a short distance ($<$ 0.5 m) in a fraction of a second, with\nlarge angular variations due to the complexity of speech, (ii) a longer\ndistance, approximately 1 m, where directed transport is driven by individual\nvortical puffs corresponding to plosive sounds, and (iii) a distance out to\nabout 2 m, or even further, where sequential plosives in a sentence,\ncorresponding effectively to a train of puffs, create conical, jet-like flows.\nThe latter dictates the long-time transport in a conversation. We believe that\nthis work will inform thinking about the role of ventilation, aerosol transport\nin disease transmission for humans and other animals, and yield a better\nunderstanding of linguistic aerodynamics, i.e., aerophonetics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jun 2020 16:54:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2020 01:19:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 26 Sep 2020 01:52:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-18"}

At each iteration, the server\nbroadcasts the current global model to the devices for local training, and\naggregates the local model updates from the devices to update the global model.\nPrevious work on the communication efficiency of FL has mainly focused on the\naggregation of model updates from the devices, assuming perfect broadcasting of\nthe global model. In this paper, we instead consider broadcasting a compressed\nversion of the global model. This is to further reduce the communication cost\nof FL, which can be particularly limited when the global model is to be\ntransmitted over a wireless medium. We introduce a lossy FL (LFL) algorithm, in\nwhich both the global model and the local model updates are quantized before\nbeing transmitted.

However, attempts for generally applicable methods beyond\nclassification did not attain similar performance. In this paper, we address\nthis limitation by proposing a simple yet effective task-agnostic OOD detection\nmethod. We estimate the probability density functions (pdfs) of intermediate\nfeatures of a pre-trained DNN by performing kernel density estimation (KDE) on\nthe training dataset. As direct application of KDE to feature maps is hindered\nby their high dimensionality, we use a set of lower-dimensional marginalized\nKDE models instead of a single high-dimensional one. At test time, we evaluate\nthe pdfs on a test sample and produce a confidence score that indicates the\nsample is OOD. The use of KDE eliminates the need for making simplifying\nassumptions about the underlying feature pdfs and makes the proposed method\ntask-agnostic. We perform extensive experiments on classification tasks using\nbenchmark datasets for OOD detection. Additionally, we perform experiments on\nmedical image segmentation tasks using brain MRI datasets. The results\ndemonstrate that the proposed method consistently achieves high OOD detection\nperformance in both classification and segmentation tasks and improves\nstate-of-the-art in almost all cases.

We find the underlying reason is that the regression network in\nanchor-based methods is only trained on the positive anchor boxes (i.e., $IoU\n\\geq0.6$). This mechanism makes it difficult to refine the anchors whose\noverlap with the target objects are small. In this paper, we propose a novel\nobject-aware anchor-free network to address this issue. First, instead of\nrefining the reference anchor boxes, we directly predict the position and scale\nof target objects in an anchor-free fashion. Since each pixel in groundtruth\nboxes is well trained, the tracker is capable of rectifying inexact predictions\nof target objects during inference. Second, we introduce a feature alignment\nmodule to learn an object-aware feature from predicted bounding boxes. The\nobject-aware feature can further contribute to the classification of target\nobjects and background. Moreover, we present a novel tracking framework based\non the anchor-free model.

It tries to find the optimal architecture in a\nshallow search network and then measures its performance in a deep evaluation\nnetwork. The independent optimization of the search and evaluation networks,\nhowever, leaves room for potential improvement by allowing interaction between\nthe two networks. To address the problematic optimization issue, we propose new\njoint optimization objectives and a novel Cyclic Differentiable ARchiTecture\nSearch framework, dubbed CDARTS. Considering the structure difference, CDARTS\nbuilds a cyclic feedback mechanism between the search and evaluation networks\nwith introspective distillation. First, the search network generates an initial\narchitecture for evaluation, and the weights of the evaluation network are\noptimized. Second, the architecture weights in the search network are further\noptimized by the label supervision in classification, as well as the\nregularization from the evaluation network through feature distillation.\nRepeating the above cycle results in joint optimization of the search and\nevaluation networks and thus enables the evolution of the architecture to fit\nthe final evaluation network. The experiments and analysis on CIFAR, ImageNet\nand NAS-Bench-201 demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach over\nthe state-of-the-art ones.

From the break frequency, $\\nu_{\\rm b} = 1.6_{-1.0}^{+3.0}\n\\times 10^{12}$ Hz, the magnetic field was estimated as $B\\simeq1$-$4$ mG. This\nis higher than the minimum-energy magnetic field of the substructures by a\nfactor of $3$--$10$. Even if the origin of the excess is larger than $\\sim 100$\npc, the magnetic field stronger than the minimum-energy field is confirmed. It\nis proposed that regions with a magnetic field locally boosted via plasma\nturbulence are observed as the substructures. The derived energy index below\nthe break, $\\alpha \\sim 0.22$ (conservatively $<0.42$), is difficult to be\nattributed to the strong-shock acceleration ($\\alpha = 0.5$). Stochastic\nacceleration and magnetic reconnection are considered as a plausible\nalternative mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jun 2020 17:58:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-19"}

Powderday\nbuilds on FSPS population synthesis models, Hyperion dust radiative transfer,\nand employs yt to interface between different software packages. We include our\nstellar population synthesis modeling on the fly, which allows for significant\nrun-time flexibility in the assumed stellar physics. We include a model for\nnebular line emission that can employ either precomputed Cloudy lookup tables\n(for efficiency), or direct photoionization calculations for all young stars\n(for flexibility). The dust content follows either observationally-motivated\nprescriptions, direct modeling from galaxy formation simulations, or a novel\napproach that includes the dust content via learning-based algorithms from the\nSIMBA cosmological galaxy formation simulation. AGN can additionally be\nincluded via a range of prescriptions. The output of these models are broadband\nSEDs, as well as filter-convolved images. Powderday is designed to eliminate\nlast-mile efforts by researchers that employ different hydrodynamic galaxy\nformation models, and seamlessly interfaces with GIZMO, AREPO, GASOLINE,\nCHANGA, and ENZO. We demonstrate the capabilities of the code via three\napplications: a model for the star formation rate (SFR) - infrared luminosity\nrelation in galaxies (including the impact of AGN); the impact of circumstellar\ndust around AGB stars on the mid-infrared emission from galaxy SEDs; and the\nimpact of galaxy inclination angle on dust attenuation laws.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jun 2020 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-20"}

These structures are thought to\nbe triggered by tidal interactions and possibly maintained via gas accretion.\nHowever, it is still unknown whether they are long-lived stable structures.

Given\nthe mass difference between the Clouds and the notable consequences of this\ninteraction, we can speculate that this should have been one of their closest\nencounters.

In\nthis paper, we measure the SN efficiency $\\eta$, namely the fraction of the\ntotal SN energy needed to sustain turbulence in galaxies, and verify that SNe\ncan indeed be the sole driving mechanism. The key novelty of our approach is\nthat we take into account the increased turbulence dissipation timescale\nassociated to the flaring in outer regions of gaseous discs. We analyse the\ndistribution and kinematics of HI and CO in 10 nearby star-forming galaxies to\nobtain the radial profiles of the kinetic energy per unit area, for both the\natomic gas and the molecular gas. We use a theoretical model to reproduce the\nobserved energy with the sum of turbulent energy from SNe, as inferred from the\nobserved star formation rate (SFR) surface density, and the gas thermal energy.\nWe find that the observed kinetic energy is remarkably well reproduced by our\nmodel across the whole extent of the galactic discs, assuming $\\eta$ constant\nwith the galactocentric radius. Taking into account the uncertainties on the\nSFR surface density and on the atomic gas phase, we obtain that the median SN\nefficiencies for our sample of galaxies are $\\langle \\eta_\\mathrm{atom}\n\\rangle=0.015_{-0.008}^{+0.018}$ for the atomic gas and $\\langle\n\\eta_\\mathrm{mol} \\rangle = 0.003_{-0.002}^{+0.006}$ for the molecular gas.

This interpretation is mainly based on two inferences: that the\nemission attributed to the outer Be star is stationary, and that the inner\nstar, which is used as mass calibrator for the black hole, is a B-type giant.\nWe re-investigate the properties of HR 6819 by spectral disentangling and an\natmosphere analysis of the disentangled spectra to search for a possibly\nsimpler alternative explanation for HR 6819. Disentangling implies that the Be\ncomponent is not a static tertiary, but rather a component of the binary in the\n40-d orbit. The inferred radial velocity amplitudes imply an extreme mass ratio\nof M_2/M_1 = 15 +/- 3. We infer spectroscopic masses of 0.4$^{+0.3}_{-0.1}$\nMsun and 6$^{+5}_{-3}$ Msun for the primary and secondary, which agree well\nwith the dynamical masses for an inclination of i = 32 deg. This indicates that\nthe primary might be a stripped star rather than a B-type giant. Evolutionary\nmodelling suggests that a possible progenitor system would be a tight (P_i ~\n2d) B+B binary system that experienced conservative mass transfer. While the\nobserved nitrogen enrichment of the primary conforms with the predictions of\nthe evolutionary models, we find no indications for the predicted He\nenrichment. We suggest that HR 6819 is a binary system consisting of a stripped\nB-type primary and a rapidly-rotating Be star that formed from a previous\nmass-transfer event. In the framework of this interpretation, HR 6819 does not\ncontain a black hole. Interferometry can distinguish between these two\nscenarios by providing an independent measurement of the separation between the\nvisible components.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jun 2020 18:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-09"}

Finally, we also investigate how the results are\naffected by the inclusion of additional data, such as ranks of gauge/flavor\ngroups and certain variables motivated by the existence of underlying\nDiophantine equations. In all questions considered, high accuracy and\nconfidence can be achieved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jun 2020 18:01:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-22"}

In order to enable\neasy decentralisation, QMIX restricts the joint action $Q$-values it can\nrepresent to be a monotonic mixing of each agent's utilities. However, this\nrestriction prevents it from representing value functions in which an agent's\nordering over its actions can depend on other agents' actions. To analyse this\nrepresentational limitation, we first formalise the objective QMIX optimises,\nwhich allows us to view QMIX as an operator that first computes the\n$Q$-learning targets and then projects them into the space representable by\nQMIX. This projection returns a representable $Q$-value that minimises the\nunweighted squared error across all joint actions. We show in particular that\nthis projection can fail to recover the optimal policy even with access to\n$Q^*$, which primarily stems from the equal weighting placed on each joint\naction. We rectify this by introducing a weighting into the projection, in\norder to place more importance on the better joint actions.

As a vulnerable part of the cerebral blood supply,\npathology of small vessels can cause serious problems such as Cerebral Small\nVessel Diseases (CSVD). It has also been shown that CSVD is related to\nneurodegeneration, such as Alzheimer's disease. With the advancement of 7 Tesla\nMRI systems, higher spatial image resolution can be achieved, enabling the\ndepiction of very small vessels in the brain. Non-Deep Learning-based\napproaches for vessel segmentation, e.g., Frangi's vessel enhancement with\nsubsequent thresholding, are capable of segmenting medium to large vessels but\noften fail to segment small vessels. The sensitivity of these methods to small\nvessels can be increased by extensive parameter tuning or by manual\ncorrections, albeit making them time-consuming, laborious, and not feasible for\nlarger datasets. This paper proposes a deep learning architecture to\nautomatically segment small vessels in 7 Tesla 3D Time-of-Flight (ToF) Magnetic\nResonance Angiography (MRA) data. The algorithm was trained and evaluated on a\nsmall imperfect semi-automatically segmented dataset of only 11 subjects; using\nsix for training, two for validation, and three for testing.

Abundant\ncircumstantial evidence suggests that accumulation of cold gas near the central\nblack hole strongly boosts the feedback output, keeping the ambient medium in a\nstate marginally unstable to condensation and formation of cold gas clouds.\nHowever, the ability of that mechanism to self-regulate may depend on numerous\nenvironmental factors, including the depth of the potential well and the\npressure of the surrounding circumgalactic medium (CGM). Here we present a\nsuite of numerical simulations that explores the dependence of cold-fuelled\nbipolar kinetic feedback on those environmental factors. Halo mass in this\nsimulation suite ranges from $2 \\times 10^{12} \\, M_\\odot$ to $8 \\times 10^{14}\n\\, M_\\odot$. We include the spatially extended mass and energy input from the\nmassive galaxy's old stellar population, which is capable of sweeping gas out\nof the galaxy and away from the central black hole if the confining CGM\npressure is sufficiently low. Our simulations show that this feedback mechanism\nis tightly self-regulating in a massive galaxy with a deep central potential\nand low CGM pressure, permitting only small amounts of multiphase gas to\naccumulate and allowing almost no star formation. In a massive galaxy of\nsimilar mass but a shallower central potential and greater CGM pressure the\nsame feedback mechanism is more episodic, producing extended multiphase gas and\noccasionally allowing small rates of star formation ($\\sim 0.1 \\, M_\\odot \\,\n{\\rm yr}^{-1}$). At the low-mass end of the explored range the mechanism\nbecomes implausibly explosive, perhaps because the ambient gas initially has no\nangular momentum, which would have reduced the amount of condensed gas capable\nof fueling feedback.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jun 2020 19:02:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2020 17:30:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-23"}

However, two-point schemes require two evaluations\nof the objective function at each iteration, which can be impractical in\napplications where the data are not all available a priori, e.g., in online\noptimization.

Quantum dots in carbon nanotubes have shown\ngreat potential to build sensitive terahertz detectors usually based on\nphoton-assisted tunnelling. A recently reported mechanism combining resonant\nquantum dot transitions and tunnelling barriers asymmetries results in a narrow\nlinewidth photocurrent response with a large signal-to-noise ratio under weak\nTHz radiation.

We refine previous investigations of this\nfailure at anomaly detection for invertible generative networks and provide a\nclear explanation of it as a combination of model bias and domain prior:\nConvolutional networks learn similar low-level feature distributions when\ntrained on any natural image dataset and these low-level features dominate the\nlikelihood. Hence, when the discriminative features between inliers and\noutliers are on a high-level, e.g., object shapes, anomaly detection becomes\nparticularly challenging. To remove the negative impact of model bias and\ndomain prior on detecting high-level differences, we propose two methods,\nfirst, using the log likelihood ratios of two identical models, one trained on\nthe in-distribution data (e.g., CIFAR10) and the other one on a more general\ndistribution of images (e.g., 80 Million Tiny Images). We also derive a novel\noutlier loss for the in-distribution network on samples from the more general\ndistribution to further improve the performance. Secondly, using a multi-scale\nmodel like Glow, we show that low-level features are mainly captured at early\nscales. Therefore, using only the likelihood contribution of the final scale\nperforms remarkably well for detecting high-level feature differences of the\nout-of-distribution and the in-distribution.

In cosmology, blind analysis is recently\nmaking its entrance, as the field progresses into a fully fledged\nhigh-precision science. The credibility, reliability and robustness of results\nfrom future sky-surveys will dramatically increase if the effect of\nconfirmation bias is kept under control by using an appropriate blinding\nprocedure. Here, we present a catalog-level blinding scheme for galaxy\nclustering data apt to be used in future spectroscopic galaxy surveys. We shift\nthe individual galaxy positions along the line of sight based on 1) a geometric\nshift mimicking the Alcock-Paczynski effect and 2) a perturbative shift akin to\nredshift-space distortions. This procedure has several advantages. After\ncombining the two steps above, it is almost impossible to accidentally unblind.\nThe procedure induces a shift in cosmological parameters without changing the\ngalaxies' angular positions, hence without interfering with the effects of\nangular systematics. Since the method is applied at catalog level, there is no\nneed to adopt several blinding schemes tuned to different summary statistics,\nlikelihood choices or types of analyses. By testing the method on mock catalogs\nand the BOSS DR12 catalog we demonstrate its performance in blinding galaxy\nclustering data for relevant cosmological parameters sensitive to the\nbackground expansion rate and the growth rate of structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jun 2020 21:15:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Sep 2020 17:23:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-11"}

One of its latest incarnations is cryptocurrency mining, where a\nwebsite instructs the visitor's browser to participate in building a\ncryptocurrency ledger (e.g., Bitcoin, Monero) in exchange for a small reward in\nthe same currency. In its essence, this practice trades the user's electric\nbill (or battery level) for cryptocurrency. With user consent, this exchange\ncan be a legitimate funding source - for example, UNICEF has collected over 27k\ncharity donations on a website dedicated to this purpose, thehopepage.org.\nRegrettably, this practice also easily lends itself to abuse: in this form,\ncalled cryptojacking, attacks surreptitiously mine in the users browser, and\nprofits are collected either by website owners or by hackers that planted the\nmining script into a vulnerable page. Cryptojackers have been bettering their\nevasion techniques, incorporating in their toolkits domain fluxing, content\nobfuscation, the use of WebAssembly, and throttling. Whereas most\nstate-of-the-art defenses address multiple of these evasion techniques, none is\nresistant against all.

In this paper,\nwe introduce a new approach to formally verify the most commonly considered\nsafety specifications for ReLU NNs -- i.e. polytopic specifications on the\ninput and output of the network. Like some other approaches, ours uses a\nrelaxed convex program to mitigate the combinatorial complexity of the problem.\nHowever, unique in our approach is the way we use a convex solver not only as a\nlinear feasibility checker, but also as a means of penalizing the amount of\nrelaxation allowed in solutions. In particular, we encode each ReLU by means of\nthe usual linear constraints, and combine this with a convex objective function\nthat penalizes the discrepancy between the output of each neuron and its\nrelaxation. This convex function is further structured to force the largest\nrelaxations to appear closest to the input layer; this provides the further\nbenefit that the most problematic neurons are conditioned as early as possible,\nwhen conditioning layer by layer. This paradigm can be leveraged to create a\nverification algorithm that is not only faster in general than competing\napproaches, but is also able to verify considerably more safety properties; we\nevaluated PEREGRiNN on a standard MNIST robustness verification suite to\nsubstantiate these claims.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jun 2020 21:33:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 18 Apr 2021 19:02:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-20"}

We show that\nGPP outperforms several unsupervised and supervised techniques on three\ndifferent sensing models -- linear compressive sensing with known, and unknown\ncalibration settings, and the non-linear phase retrieval problem. Finally, we\npropose an alternating optimization strategy using GPP for joint\ncalibration-and-reconstruction which performs favorably against several\nbaselines on a real world, un-calibrated compressive sensing dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jun 2020 22:24:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 2020 16:51:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-06"}

Applying\na deterministic quadrature scheme results in a massively scalable technique\nthat is sample-efficient and achieves spectral accuracy.

Titan's lakes predominantly contain liquid\nmethane, ethane, and nitrogen, with methane evaporation driving its\nhydrological cycle. Molecular interactions between these three species lead to\nnon-ideal behavior that causes Titan's lakes to behave differently than Earth's\nlakes. Here, we numerically investigate how methane evaporation and non-ideal\ninteractions affect the physical properties, structure, dynamics, and evolution\nof shallow lakes on Titan.

In this work, we provide a\nprincipled exploration of pruning by building on a natural notion of\nimportance.

For neural networks, we\ndemonstrate that the importance can be at odds with larger magnitudes and\nproper initialization is critical for magnitude-based pruning. Specifically, we\nidentify settings in which weights become more important despite becoming\nsmaller, which in turn leads to a catastrophic failure of magnitude-based\npruning.

However, the application of topic\nmodeling is challenging due to data sparsity, e.g., in a small collection of\n(short) documents and thus, generate incoherent topics and sub-optimal document\nrepresentations. To address the problem, we propose a lifelong learning\nframework for neural topic modeling that can continuously process streams of\ndocument collections, accumulate topics and guide future topic modeling tasks\nby knowledge transfer from several sources to better deal with the sparse data.\nIn the lifelong process, we particularly investigate jointly: (1) sharing\ngenerative homologies (latent topics) over lifetime to transfer prior\nknowledge, and (2) minimizing catastrophic forgetting to retain the past\nlearning via novel selective data augmentation, co-training and topic\nregularization approaches. Given a stream of document collections, we apply the\nproposed Lifelong Neural Topic Modeling (LNTM) framework in modeling three\nsparse document collections as future tasks and demonstrate improved\nperformance quantified by perplexity, topic coherence and information retrieval\ntask.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jun 2020 00:43:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-22"}

This\npaper presents practical correction schemes to solve this important problem.\nThe study begins with a theoretical analysis, for arbitrary vibration and any\nscanning configuration, which shows that the only measurement required is of\nthe vibration velocity at the incident point on the final steering mirror in\nthe direction of the outgoing laser beam and this underpins the two correction\noptions investigated. Correction sensor location is critical; the first scheme\nuses an accelerometer pair located on the SLDV front panel, either side of the\nemitted laser beam, while the second uses a single accelerometer located along\nthe optical axis behind the final steering mirror. Initial experiments with a\nvibrating sensor head and stationary target confirmed the sensitivity to sensor\nhead vibration together with the effectiveness of the correction schemes which\nreduced overall error by 17 dB (accelerometer pair) and 27 dB (single\naccelerometer). In extensive further tests with both sensor head and target\nvibration, conducted across a range of scan angles, the correction schemes\nreduced error by typically 14 dB (accelerometer pair) and 20 dB (single\naccelerometer). RMS phase error was also up to 30% lower for the single\naccelerometer option, confirming it as the preferred option. The theory\nsuggests a geometrical weighting of the correction measurements and this\nprovides a small additional improvement. Since the direction of the outgoing\nlaser beam and its incident point on the final steering mirror both change as\nthe mirrors scan the laser beam, the use of fixed axis correction transducers\nmounted in fixed locations makes the correction imperfect.

This extraordinary polymorphism of ice arises from the geometric\nflexibility of hydrogen bonds and hydrogen ordering, and makes ice a unique\npresence with its universality in the wide fields of material and earth and\nplanetary science. A prominent unsolved question concerning the diversity is\nwhether a hydrogen-disordered phase of ice transforms into only one\nhydrogen-ordered phase, as inferred from the current phase diagram of ice,\nalthough its possible hydrogen configurations have close energies. Recent\nexperiments on a high-pressure hydrogen-disordered phase, ice VI, revealed an\nunknown hydrogen-ordered form ($\\beta$-XV) besides the known ordered phase, ice\nXV, which would be a counterexample of the question. However, due to lack of\nexperimental evidence, it has not been clarified whether $\\beta$-XV is a\ndistinct crystalline phase. Herein we report a second hydrogen-ordered phase\nfor ice VI, ice XIX, unambiguously demonstrated by neutron diffraction\nmeasurements. The phase boundary between ice VI and ice XIX shows that ice VI\ncontracts upon the hydrogen ordering, which thermodynamically stabilizes ice\nXIX in higher-pressure region than ice XV because of its smaller volume than\nice XV. The pressure-driven phase competition between hydrogen-ordered phases,\nalso theoretically suggested in other ice polymorphs, can induce hydrogen\nordering of ice in different manners. Thus, this study demonstrates a hitherto\nundiscovered polymorphism of ice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jun 2020 02:02:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-22"}

In this work, we show that the bound based on the\noracle prior can be suboptimal: In some cases, a stronger bound is obtained by\nusing a data-dependent oracle prior, i.e., a conditional expectation of the\nposterior, given a subset of the training data that is then excluded from the\nempirical risk term. While using data to learn a prior is a known heuristic,\nits essential role in optimal bounds is new. In fact, we show that using data\ncan mean the difference between vacuous and nonvacuous bounds.

Second, what\ncomputational models are most effective in the accurate detection of lying\npostures? Finally, what physical configuration of the sensor system is most\neffective for lying posture tracking? To answer these important research\nquestions, in this article, we propose a comprehensive approach to design a\nsensor system that uses a single accelerometer along with machine learning\nalgorithms for in-bed lying posture classification. We design two categories of\nmachine learning algorithms based on deep learning and traditional\nclassification with handcrafted features to detect lying postures.

They occur at a\ncrucial time in the evolution of these systems, when the accretion disk\nemission starts to dominate over coronal emission. Flip-flops have only rarely\nbeen observed and are poorly understood.\n  Methods: We detect 15 flip-flops in the 2018 outburst of Swift J1658.2-4242,\nin observations by XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, Astrosat, Swift, Insight-HXMT, INTEGRAL,\nand ATCA. We analyse their light curves, search for periodicities, compute\ntheir PDS, and fit their X-ray spectra, to investigate the source behaviour\nduring flip-flop transitions, and how the interval featuring flip-flops differs\nfrom the rest of the outburst.\n  Results: The flip-flops of Swift J1658.2-4242 are of an extreme variety,\nexhibiting flux differences of up to 77% within ~100s, much larger than has\nbeen seen so far. We observe radical changes in the PDS simultaneous with the\nsharp flux variations, featuring transitions between the Quasi-Periodic\nOscillation types C and A, which have never been observed before. Changes to\nthe PDS are delayed, but more rapid than changes in the light curve. Flip-flops\noccur in two intervals, separated by two weeks in which these phenomena were\nnot seen. Transitions between the two flip-flop states occurred at random\ninteger multiples of a fundamental period, of 2.761ks in the first interval,\nand 2.61ks in the second. Spectral analysis reveals the high and low flux\nflip-flop states to be similar, but distinct from intervals lacking flip-flops.\nA change in the inner temperature of the accretion disk is responsible for most\nof the flux difference in the flip-flops. We highlight the importance of\ncorrecting for the influence of the dust scattering halo on the X-ray spectra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jun 2020 02:15:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-16"}

In real-world applications, BO often faces a major problem\nof missing values in inputs. The missing inputs can happen in two cases. First,\nthe historical data for training BO often contain missing values. Second, when\nperforming the function evaluation (e.g. computing alloy strength in a heat\ntreatment process), errors may occur (e.g. a thermostat stops working) leading\nto an erroneous situation where the function is computed at a random unknown\nvalue instead of the suggested value. To deal with this problem, a common\napproach just simply skips data points where missing values happen. Clearly,\nthis naive method cannot utilize data efficiently and often leads to poor\nperformance. In this paper, we propose a novel BO method to handle missing\ninputs. We first find a probability distribution of each missing value so that\nwe can impute the missing value by drawing a sample from its distribution.

High growth temperatures and sulfur/metal ratios were required to\nreduce domain misorientation and achieve epitaxial tungsten sulfide monolayers\nwith low in-plane rotational twist (0.09 deg).

Online communities,\nforums, and social media provide potential venues to search for relevant\nquestions and answers, or post questions and seek answers from other members.\nHowever, due to the nature of such sites, there are always a limited number of\nrelevant questions and responses to search from, and posted questions are\nrarely answered immediately.

In order to address this issue in the context of sharp interface\ncapturing, a novel, preconditioned and localized phase field method is\ndeveloped in this work. The numerical accuracy of interface normal vectors is\nimproved by utilizing a preconditioning procedure based on the level set method\nwith localized artificial viscosity stabilization.

To lower complexity, channel statistics\ncan be utilized such that only infrequent update of the channel information is\nneeded. To reduce the complexity and provide robustness, in this work, we\npropose a deep learning (DL) framework to deal with both hybrid beamforming and\nchannel estimation. For this purpose, we introduce three deep convolutional\nneural network (CNN) architectures.

This approach provides\na Mixed-Integer Semi-Definite formulation to the problem which can be optimally\nsolved for small instances. For larger instances, two heuristics are proposed\nwhich provide good sub-optimal results. To conclude, numerical simulations are\nshown to prove the capabilities and efficiency of the proposed path planning\nstrategy.

It attracts increasing attention to adversarial\nattacks, which can be used to evaluate the security and robustness of models\nbefore they are deployed. However, to our best knowledge, there is no specific\nresearch on the adversarial attacks for multi-view deep models. This paper\nproposes two multi-view attack strategies, two-stage attack (TSA) and\nend-to-end attack (ETEA). With the mild assumption that the single-view model\non which the target multi-view model is based is known, we first propose the\nTSA strategy. The main idea of TSA is to attack the multi-view model with\nadversarial examples generated by attacking the associated single-view model,\nby which state-of-the-art single-view attack methods are directly extended to\nthe multi-view scenario. Then we further propose the ETEA strategy when the\nmulti-view model is provided publicly. The ETEA is applied to accomplish direct\nattacks on the target multi-view model, where we develop three effective\nmulti-view attack methods. Finally, based on the fact that adversarial examples\ngeneralize well among different models, this paper takes the adversarial attack\non the multi-view convolutional neural network as an example to validate that\nthe effectiveness of the proposed multi-view attacks. Extensive experimental\nresults demonstrate that our multi-view attack strategies are capable of\nattacking the multi-view deep models, and we additionally find that multi-view\nmodels are more robust than single-view models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jun 2020 08:07:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-22"}

In this paper, we investigate how BatchNorm\ncauses this vulnerability and proposed new normalization that is robust to\nadversarial attacks. We first observe that adversarial images tend to shift the\ndistribution of BatchNorm input, and this shift makes train-time estimated\npopulation statistics inaccurate. We hypothesize that these inaccurate\nstatistics make models with BatchNorm more vulnerable to adversarial attacks.\nWe prove our hypothesis by replacing train-time estimated statistics with\nstatistics calculated from the inference-time batch.

One popular approach seeks to\nensure that each cluster contains groups in (roughly) the same proportion in\nwhich they exist in the population. The normative principle at play is balance:\nany cluster might act as a representative of the data, and thus should reflect\nits diversity.\n  But clustering also captures a different form of representativeness. A core\nprinciple in most clustering problems is that a cluster center should be\nrepresentative of the cluster it represents, by being \"close\" to the points\nassociated with it. This is so that we can effectively replace the points by\ntheir cluster centers without significant loss in fidelity, and indeed is a\ncommon \"use case\" for clustering. For such a clustering to be fair, the centers\nshould \"represent\" different groups equally well. We call such a clustering a\ngroup-representative clustering.\n  In this paper, we study the structure and computation of group-representative\nclusterings.

In fast scramblers,\ninformation spreads as a logarithmic function of the number of degrees of\nfreedom. Ordinarily, under an RG-flow, scrambling will become faster in the IR\nsince many degrees of freedom are integrated out, as a consequence of the\nc-theorem. In this article, we consider a class of Holographic quantum field\ntheories (QFT), which are strongly coupled large $N$ gauge theories with large\nnumber of adjoint and fundamental matter, in which scrambling slows down in the\nIR. This happens since more degrees of freedom are inserted in the IR, compared\nto the UV, in a precise sense. For generic large $N$ gauge theories, we also\nexplore general, perturbative flow features of the corresponding Lyapunov\nexponent, based on the Callan-Symanzik equation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jun 2020 09:40:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-22"}

We employ the general matrix\nmethod to find the fundamental solutions for the linearized boundary value\nproblem conserving mass, momentum and energy. We find that the dynamics can be\nstable or unstable depending on the values of the acceleration, the surface\ntension and the density ratio. In the stable regime, the flow has the\nnon-perturbed fields in the bulk, is shear-free at the interface, and has the\nconstant interface velocity. The dynamics is unstable only when it is\naccelerated, and when the acceleration value exceeds a threshold combining\ncontributions of the inertial stabilization mechanism and the surface tension.\nThe properties of this instability unambiguously differentiate it from other\nfluid instabilities. Particularly, its velocity field has potential and\nvortical components in the bulk and is shear free at the interface. Its\ndynamics describes the standing wave with the growing amplitude, and has the\ngrowing interface velocity. For strong accelerations, this fluid instability of\nthe conservative dynamics has the fastest growth-rate and the largest\nstabilizing surface tension value when compared to the classical Landau and\nRayleigh-Taylor dynamics.

For instance, a research article could have\nmultiple collaborating authors, and therefore the co-authorship network is best\nrepresented as a hypergraph. In this work, we focus on the problem of hyperedge\nprediction. This problem has immense applications in multiple domains, such as\npredicting new collaborations in social networks, discovering new chemical\nreactions in metabolic networks, etc. Despite having significant importance,\nthe problem of hyperedge prediction hasn't received adequate attention, mainly\nbecause of its inherent complexity. In a graph with $n$ nodes the number of\npotential edges is $\\mathcal{O}(n^{2})$, whereas in a hypergraph, the number of\npotential hyperedges is $\\mathcal{O}(2^{n})$. To avoid searching through such a\nhuge space, current methods restrain the original problem in the following two\nways. One class of algorithms assume the hypergraphs to be $k$-uniform.\nHowever, many real-world systems are not confined only to have interactions\ninvolving $k$ components. Thus, these algorithms are not suitable for many\nreal-world applications. The second class of algorithms requires a candidate\nset of hyperedges from which the potential hyperedges are chosen. In the\nabsence of domain knowledge, the candidate set can have $\\mathcal{O}(2^{n})$\npossible hyperedges, which makes this problem intractable. We propose HPRA -\nHyperedge Prediction using Resource Allocation, the first of its kind\nalgorithm, which overcomes these issues and predicts hyperedges of any\ncardinality without using any candidate hyperedge set. HPRA is a\nsimilarity-based method working on the principles of the resource allocation\nprocess.

Most of the state of the art frameworks focus on adversarial\nattacks for images and other structured model inputs, but not for categorical\nsequences models.\n  Successful attacks on classifiers of categorical sequences are challenging\nbecause the model input is tokens from finite sets, so a classifier score is\nnon-differentiable with respect to inputs, and gradient-based attacks are not\napplicable. Common approaches deal with this problem working at a token level,\nwhile the discrete optimization problem at hand requires a lot of resources to\nsolve.\n  We instead use a fine-tuning of a language model for adversarial attacks as a\ngenerator of adversarial examples. To optimize the model, we define a\ndifferentiable loss function that depends on a surrogate classifier score and\non a deep learning model that evaluates approximate edit distance. So, we\ncontrol both the adversability of a generated sequence and its similarity to\nthe initial sequence.\n  As a result, we obtain semantically better samples. Moreover, they are\nresistant to adversarial training and adversarial detectors.

Moreover, by extending Chern-Simons (CS) gravity to include\nderivatives of a scalar field up to the second order, a more general class of\nPV gravity theory, which we call the CNCL model, has been proposed~[M.\nCrisostomi {\\it et al.}, Phys.

Our parametrization includes the CNCL model as well as CS\ngravity. The effect of parity violation on the gravitational waveform is\nmaximum when the source binary orientation to our line of sight is edge-on,\nwhile the modified waveform reduces to the parity-symmetric one when the source\nis face-on. We perform a search for the signature of such modification by using\nthe LIGO/Virgo O1/O2 catalog.

Here, we introduce a selection of new non-diffusive\nmechanisms into an astrochemical model, to account for the failure of the\nstandard diffusive picture and to provide a more generalized scenario of COM\nformation on interstellar grains. New generic rate formulations are provided\nfor cases where: (i) radicals are formed by reactions occurring close to\nanother reactant, producing an immediate follow-on reaction; (ii) radicals are\nformed in an excited state, allowing them to overcome activation barriers to\nreact with nearby stable molecules; (iii) radicals are formed through\nphoto-dissociation close to a reaction partner, followed by immediate reaction.\nEach process occurs without the diffusion of large radicals. The new mechanisms\nsignificantly enhance cold COM abundances, successfully reproducing key\nobservational results for prestellar core L1544. H-abstraction from\ngrain-surface COMs, followed by recombination, plays a crucial role in\namplifying chemical desorption into the gas phase.

However, quantitative data on\nuser behavior (e.g. streaming duration, choice of end device and resolution)\nare often lacking or difficult to integrate in LCA. Additionally, identifying\nrelevant determinants of user behavior, such as the design of streaming\nplatforms or user motivations, may help to design streaming services that keep\nenvironmental impact at a passable level.

This novel\nwaveform-based VAD algorithm, with a short-hand notation \"WVAD\", has two main\nparticularities. First, as compared to most conventional VAD systems that use\nspectral features, raw-waveforms employed in WVAD contain more comprehensive\ninformation and thus are supposed to facilitate more accurate speech/non-speech\npredictions. Second, based on the multi-branched architecture, WVAD can be\nextended by using an ensemble of encoders, referred to as WEVAD, that\nincorporate multiple attribute information in utterances, and thus can yield\nbetter VAD performance for specified acoustic conditions. We evaluated the\npresented WVAD and WEVAD for the VAD task in two datasets: First, the\nexperiments conducted on AURORA2 reveal that WVAD outperforms many\nstate-of-the-art VAD algorithms.

Stars\nleaving the main sequence (MS) from the hot side of the Lithium dip (LD) at a\nfixed age can include a range of mass, varying degrees of core degeneracy, and\nhelium ignition under quiescent or flash conditions. An ongoing survey of a\nsignificant sample of stars from the giant branch to below the LD in key open\nclusters has revealed patterns that supply critical clues to the underlying\nsource of Li variation among stars of differing mass and age. While the LD is\nwell established in OC of this age, stars on the hot side of the LD can exhibit\nLi ranging from the apparent primordial cluster value to upper limits similar\nto those found at the LD center, despite occupying the same region of the\ncolor-magnitude diagram (CMD). Stars on the first-ascent giant branch show a\ndramatic decline in measurable Li that correlates strongly with increasing age\nand reduced turnoff mass. We discuss how these trends can be explained in the\ncontext of the existence of the LD itself and the temporal evolution of\nindividual stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jun 2020 14:40:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-22"}

We revisit the calculation of\nthe present PBH merger rate. Solar mass PBHs form clusters at fairly high\nredshifts, which evaporate at lower redshifts. We consider in detail the\nevolution of binary properties in such clusters due to three-body interactions\nbetween the two PBH binary members and a third by-passing PBH, for the first\ntime, by full numerical integration. A Monte-Carlo analysis shows that formerly\npredicted merger rates are reduced by orders of magnitude due to such\ninteractions. The natural prediction of PBH dark matter formed during the QCD\nepoch yields a pronounced peak around $1M_{\\odot}$ with a small mass fraction\nof PBHs on a shoulder around $30M_{\\odot}$, dictated by the well-determined\nequation of state during the QCD epoch.

This paper examines correlations between\nself-reports and digital trace proxies of depression, anxiety, mood, social\nintegration and sleep among high school students. The study is based on a small\nbut rich multilayer data set (N = 144). The data set contains mood and sleep\nmeasures, assessed daily over a 4-month period, along with survey measures at\ntwo points in time and information about online activity from VK, the most\npopular social networking site in Russia. Our analysis indicates that 1) the\nsentiments expressed in social media posts are correlated with depression;\nnamely, adolescents with more severe symptoms of depression write more negative\nposts, 2) late-night posting indicates less sleep and poorer sleep quality, and\n3) students who were nominated less often as somebody's friend in the survey\nhave fewer friends on VK and their posts receive fewer \"likes.\" However, these\ncorrelations are generally weak. These results demonstrate that digital traces\ncan serve as useful supplements to, rather than substitutes for, survey data in\nstudies on adolescents' well-being.

OGLE16aaa is one such tidal disruption event (TDE) which\nrapidly brightened and peaked in the optical/UV bands in early 2016 and\nsubsequently decayed over the rest of the year. OGLE16aaa was detected in an\nXMM-Newton X-ray observation on June 9, 2016 with a flux slightly below the\nSwift/XRT upper limits obtained during the optical light curve peak. Between\nJune 16-21, 2016, Swift/XRT also detected OGLE16aaa and based on the stacked\nspectrum, we could infer that the X-ray luminosity had jumped up by more than a\nfactor of ten in just one week. No brightening signal was seen in the\nsimultaneous optical/UV data to cause the X-ray luminosity to exceed the\noptical/UV one. A further XMM-Newton observation on November 30, 2016 showed\nthat almost a year after the optical/UV peak, the X-ray emission was still at\nan elevated level, while the optical/UV flux decay had already leveled off to\nvalues comparable to those of the host galaxy. In all X-ray observations, the\nspectra were nicely modeled with a 50-70 eV thermal component with no intrinsic\nabsorption, with a weak X-ray tail seen only in the November 30 XMM-Newton\nobservation. The late-time X-ray behavior of OGLE16aaa strongly resembles the\ntidal disruption events ASASSN-15oi and AT2019azh. We were able to pinpoint the\ntime delay between the initial optical TDE onset and the X-ray brightening to\n$182 \\pm 5$ days, which may possibly represent the timescale between the\ninitial circularization of the disrupted star around the super-massive black\nhole and the subsequent delayed accretion. Alternatively, the delayed X-ray\nbrightening could be related to a rapid clearing of a thick envelope that\ncovers the central X-ray engine during the first six months.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jun 2020 15:12:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-22"}

Such efficiency results from the\ncapability of segmenting several voxels in a single forward pass. So, there is\na direct spatial correspondence between a unit in a feature map and the voxel\nin the same location. In a convolutional layer, the kernel spans over all\nchannels and extracts information from them. We observe that linear\nrecombination of feature maps by increasing the number of channels followed by\ncompression may enhance their discriminative power. Moreover, not all feature\nmaps have the same relevance for the classes being predicted. In order to learn\nthe inter-channel relationships and recalibrate the channels to suppress the\nless relevant ones, Squeeze and Excitation blocks were proposed in the context\nof image classification with Convolutional Neural Networks. However, this is\nnot well adapted for segmentation with Fully Convolutional Networks since they\nsegment several objects simultaneously, hence a feature map may contain\nrelevant information only in some locations.

Echo State Networks (ESNs), as a prime example of Reservoir\nComputing (RC) models, are known for their fast and precise one-shot learning,\nthat often benefit from good hyper-parameter tuning. This makes them ideal to\nchange the status quo.\n  Methods: We discuss CV of time series for predicting a concrete time interval\nof interest, suggest several schemes for cross-validating ESNs and introduce an\nefficient algorithm for implementing them. This algorithm is presented as two\nlevels of optimizations of doing $k$-fold CV. Training an RC model typically\nconsists of two stages: (i) running the reservoir with the data and (ii)\ncomputing the optimal readouts. The first level of our optimization addresses\nthe most computationally expensive part (i) and makes it remain constant\nirrespective of $k$. It dramatically reduces reservoir computations in any type\nof RC system and is enough if $k$ is small. The second level of optimization\nalso makes the (ii) part remain constant irrespective of large $k$, as long as\nthe dimension of the output is low. We discuss when the proposed validation\nschemes for ESNs could be beneficial, three options for producing the final\nmodel and empirically investigate them on six different real-world datasets, as\nwell as do empirical computation time experiments. We provide the code in an\nonline repository.\n  Results: Proposed CV schemes give better and more stable test performance in\nall the six different real-world datasets, three task types. Empirical run\ntimes confirm our complexity analysis.\n  Conclusions: In most situations $k$-fold CV of ESNs and many other RC models\ncan be done for virtually the same time and space complexity as a simple\nsingle-split validation. This enables CV to become a standard practice in RC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jun 2020 13:49:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Dec 2020 19:12:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-05"}

We first summarize our theoretical results on the\nbehavior of the scaled L-BFGS method with one update applied to a simple convex\nnonsmooth function that is unbounded below, stating conditions under which the\nmethod converges to a non-optimal point regardless of the starting point. We\nthen turn to empirically investigating whether the same phenomenon holds more\ngenerally,focusing on a difficult problem of Nesterov, as well as eigenvalue\noptimization problems arising in semidefinite programming applications. We find\nthat when applied to a nonsmooth function directly, L-BFGS, especially its\nscaled variant, often breaks down with a poor approximation to an optimal\nsolution, in sharp contrast to full BFGS. Unscaled L-BFGS is less prone to\nbreakdown but conducts far more function evaluations per iteration than scaled\nL-BFGS does, and thus it is slow. Nonetheless, it is often the case that both\nvariants obtain better results than the provably convergent, but slow,\nsubgradient method. On the other hand, when applied to Nesterov's smooth\napproximation of a nonsmooth function, scaled L-BFGS is generally much more\nefficient than unscaled L-BFGS, often obtaining good results even when the\nproblem is quite ill-conditioned. Summarizing, for large-scale nonsmooth\noptimization problems for which full BFGS and other methods for nonsmooth\noptimization are not practical, it is often better to apply L-BFGS to a smooth\napproximation of a nonsmooth problem than to apply it directly to the nonsmooth\nproblem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jun 2020 17:43:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-23"}

Particular\nparameter choices allow us to generate models of anisotropic stars in terms of\nelementary functions. Also, isotropic stars can be generated in the limit of\nvanishing anisotropy. In particular, we obtain the well known superdense models\nof Tikekar which are isotropic and have specific spheroidal geometries. The\nimpact of anisotropy on the gross physical behaviour of a compact star is\nstudied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jun 2020 05:53:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-23"}

Increasingly\nsophisticated hardware accelerators are proposed that exploit e.g. the sparsity\nin computations and make use of reduced precision arithmetic to scale down the\nenergy consumption. However, future platforms require more than just energy\nefficiency: Scalability is becoming an increasingly important factor. The\nrequired effort for physical implementation grows with the size of the\naccelerator making it more difficult to meet target constraints. Using\nmany-core platforms consisting of several homogeneous cores can alleviate the\naforementioned limitations with regard to physical implementation at the\nexpense of an increased dataflow mapping effort. While the dataflow in CNNs is\ndeterministic and can therefore be optimized offline, the problem of finding a\nsuitable scheme that minimizes both runtime and off-chip memory accesses is a\nchallenging task which becomes even more complex if an interconnect system is\ninvolved. This work presents an automated mapping strategy starting at the\nsingle-core level with different optimization targets for minimal runtime and\nminimal off-chip memory accesses. The strategy is then extended towards a\nsuitable many-core mapping scheme and evaluated using a scalable system-level\nsimulation with a network-on-chip interconnect. Design space exploration is\nperformed by mapping the well-known CNNs AlexNet and VGG-16 to platforms of\ndifferent core counts and computational power per core in order to investigate\nthe trade-offs.

Even with modern computing\narchitectures, the computational expense of DNN training can inhibit, for\ninstance, network architecture design optimization, hyper-parameter studies,\nand integration into scientific research cycles. The key factor limiting\nperformance is that both the feed-forward evaluation and the back-propagation\nrule are needed for each weight during optimization in the update rule. In this\nwork, we propose a method to decouple the evaluation of the update rule at each\nweight. At first, Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) is used to identify a\ncurrent estimate of the principal directions of evolution of weights per layer\nduring training based on the evolution observed with a few backpropagation\nsteps. Then, Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) is used to learn the dynamics of\nthe evolution of the weights in each layer according to these principal\ndirections. The DMD model is used to evaluate an approximate converged state\nwhen training the ANN. Afterward, some number of backpropagation steps are\nperformed, starting from the DMD estimates, leading to an update to the\nprincipal directions and DMD model. This iterative process is repeated until\nconvergence. By fine-tuning the number of backpropagation steps used for each\nDMD model estimation, a significant reduction in the number of operations\nrequired to train the neural networks can be achieved. In this paper, the DMD\nacceleration method will be explained in detail, along with the theoretical\njustification for the acceleration provided by DMD.

Complex algorithms and\nintelligence-based filter programs are utilized to manage, store, handle and\nmaneuver vast amounts of data for the fulfillment of specific purposes. This\npaper seeks to find the bridge between artificial intelligence and its impact\non the international policy implementation in the light of geopolitical\ninfluence, global economy and the future of labor markets. We hypothesize that\nthe distortion in the labor markets caused by artificial intelligence can be\nmitigated by a collaborative international foreign policy on the deployment of\nAI in the industrial circles. We, in this paper, then proceed to propose a\ndisposition for the essentials of AI-based foreign policy and implementation,\nwhile asking questions such as 'could AI become the real Invisible Hand\ndiscussed by economists?'.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jun 2020 10:59:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-02"}

While our model\nencompasses several existing texture models, we focus on the case where the\ncomparison between feature distributions relies on optimal transport distances.\nWe show that the semi-dual formulation of optimal transport allows to control\nthe distribution of various possible features, even if these features live in a\nhigh-dimensional space. We then study the resulting minimax optimization\nproblem, which corresponds to a Wasserstein generative model, for which the\ninner concave maximization problem can be solved with standard stochastic\ngradient methods. The alternate optimization algorithm is shown to be versatile\nin terms of applications, features and architecture; in particular it allows to\nproduce high-quality synthesized textures with different sets of features. We\nanalyze the results obtained by constraining the distribution of patches or the\ndistribution of responses to a pre-learned VGG neural network. We show that the\npatch representation can retrieve the desired textural aspect in a more precise\nmanner. We also provide a detailed comparison with state-of-the-art texture\nsynthesis methods. The GOTEX model based on patch features is also adapted to\ntexture inpainting and texture interpolation. Finally, we show how to use our\nframework to learn a feed-forward neural network that can synthesize on-the-fly\nnew textures of arbitrary size in a very fast manner. Experimental results and\ncomparisons with the mainstream methods from the literature illustrate the\nrelevance of the generative models learned with GOTEX.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jun 2020 13:32:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 Oct 2021 15:08:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-19"}

We show that, in these\nmodels, although such a lockdown may delay deaths, it eventually does not avert\na significant number of fatalities. Therefore, in these models, the efficacy of\na lockdown cannot be gauged by simply comparing figures for the deaths at the\nend of the lockdown with the projected figure for deaths by the same date\nwithout the lockdown. We provide a simple but robust heuristic argument to\nexplain why this conclusion should generalize to more elaborate compartmental\nmodels. We qualitatively discuss some important effects of a lockdown, which go\nbeyond the scope of simple models, but could cause it to increase or decrease\nan epidemic's final toll. Given the significance of these effects in India, and\nthe limitations of currently available data, we conclude that simple\nepidemiological models cannot be used to reliably quantify the impact of the\nIndian lockdown on fatalities caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jun 2020 16:07:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Aug 2020 16:09:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-27"}

Recently, a new\npretraining approach -- self-supervised learning (SSL) -- has demonstrated\npromising results on a wide range of applications. SSL does not require\nannotated labels. It is purely conducted on input data by solving auxiliary\ntasks defined on the input data examples. The current reported results show\nthat in certain applications, SSL outperforms TL and the other way around in\nother applications. There has not been a clear understanding on what properties\nof data and tasks render one approach outperforms the other. Without an\ninformed guideline, ML researchers have to try both methods to find out which\none is better empirically. It is usually time-consuming to do so. In this work,\nwe aim to address this problem. We perform a comprehensive comparative study\nbetween SSL and TL regarding which one works better under different properties\nof data and tasks, including domain difference between source and target tasks,\nthe amount of pretraining data, class imbalance in source data, and usage of\ntarget data for additional pretraining, etc. The insights distilled from our\ncomparative studies can help ML researchers decide which method to use based on\nthe properties of their applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jun 2020 05:21:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-09"}

There are different types of Chatbot that can be used as\nconversational agent in various business domains in order to increase the\ncustomer service and satisfaction. For any business domain, it requires a\nknowledge base to be built for that domain and design an information retrieval\nbased system that can respond the user with a piece of documentation or\ngenerated sentences. The core component of a Chatbot is Natural Language\nUnderstanding (NLU) which has been impressively improved by deep learning\nmethods. But we often lack such properly built NLU modules and requires more\ntime to build it from scratch for high quality conversations. This may\nencourage fresh learners to build a Chatbot from scratch with simple\narchitecture and using small dataset, although it may have reduced\nfunctionality, rather than building high quality data driven methods. This\nresearch focuses on Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Intent Classification\nmodels which can be integrated into NLU service of a Chatbot. Named entities\nwill be inserted manually in the knowledge base and automatically detected in a\ngiven sentence. The NER model in the proposed architecture is based on\nartificial neural network which is trained on manually created entities and\nevaluated using CoNLL-2003 dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jun 2020 14:47:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-09"}

This paper\nproposes a new explainable convolutional neural network (XCNN) which represents\nimportant and driving visual features of stimuli in an end-to-end model\narchitecture. This network employs encoder-decoder neural networks in a CNN\narchitecture to represent regions of interest in an image based on its\ncategory. The proposed model is trained without localization labels and\ngenerates a heat-map as part of the network architecture without extra\npost-processing steps. The experimental results on the CIFAR-10, Tiny ImageNet,\nand MNIST datasets showed the success of our algorithm (XCNN) to make CNNs\nexplainable. Based on visual assessment, the proposed model outperforms the\ncurrent algorithms in class-specific feature representation and interpretable\nheatmap generation while providing a simple and flexible network architecture.\nThe initial success of this approach warrants further study to enhance weakly\nsupervised localization and semantic segmentation in explainable frameworks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jun 2020 15:49:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}
