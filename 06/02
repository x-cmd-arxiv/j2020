Ordinal data are categorical data which exhibit a natural\nordering between the categories. In particular, they can be found in\nrecommender systems, either with explicit data (such as ratings) or implicit\ndata (such as quantized play counts). OrdNMF is a probabilistic latent factor\nmodel that generalizes Bernoulli-Poisson factorization (BePoF) and Poisson\nfactorization (PF) applied to binarized data. Contrary to these methods, OrdNMF\ncircumvents binarization and can exploit a more informative representation of\nthe data. We design an efficient variational algorithm based on a suitable\nmodel augmentation and related to variational PF. In particular, our algorithm\npreserves the scalability of PF and can be applied to huge sparse datasets. We\nreport recommendation experiments on explicit and implicit datasets, and show\nthat OrdNMF outperforms BePoF and PF applied to binarized data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jun 2020 16:02:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Jun 2020 16:14:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2020 11:21:22 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2020 14:29:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-03"}

Prior studies demonstrated that human movement and\nmobility drove the spatiotemporal distribution of COVID-19 in China. Little is\nknown, however, about the patterns and effects of co-location reduction on\ncross-county transmission risk of COVID-19.

The analysis examines the synchronicity and time lag between travel\nreduction and pandemic growth trajectory to evaluate the efficacy of social\ndistancing in ceasing the population co-location probabilities, and\nsubsequently the growth in weekly new cases. The results show that the\nmitigation effects of co-location reduction appear in the growth of weekly new\ncases with one week of delay. Furthermore, significant segregation is found\namong different county groups which are categorized based on numbers of cases.\nThe results suggest that within-group co-location probabilities remain stable,\nand social distancing policies primarily resulted in reduced cross-group\nco-location probabilities (due to travel reduction from counties with large\nnumber of cases to counties with low numbers of cases). These findings could\nhave important practical implications for local governments to inform their\nintervention measures for monitoring and reducing the spread of COVID-19, as\nwell as for adoption in future pandemics.

As networks\nwith programmable devices become widespread, it is critical that these\ncompilers be dependable.\n  This paper considers the problem of finding bugs in compilers for packet\nprocessing in the context of P4-16. We introduce domain-specific techniques to\ninduce both abnormal termination of the compiler (crash bugs) and\nmiscompilation (semantic bugs). We apply these techniques to (1) the\nopen-source P4 compiler (P4C) infrastructure, which serves as a common base for\ndifferent P4 back ends; (2) the P4 back end for the P4 reference software\nswitch; and (3) the P4 back end for the Barefoot Tofino switch.\n  Across the 3 platforms, over 8 months of bug finding, our tool Gauntlet\ndetected 96 new and distinct bugs (62 crash and 34 semantic), which we\nconfirmed with the respective compiler developers. 54 have been fixed (31 crash\nand 23 semantic); the remaining have been assigned to a developer.

We demonstrate reversible\ndynamic tuning of the alignment, and thereby the topology, of nematic LC shells\nstabilized by the nonionic amphiphilic block copolymer Pluronic F127. Deep in\nthe nematic phase, the director is tangential to the interface, but upon\napproaching the temperature TNI of the nematic-isotropic transition, the\ndirector realigns to normal. We link this to a delicate interplay between an\ninterfacial tension that is nearly independent of director orientation, and the\nconfiguration-dependent elastic deformation energy of an LC confined in a\nshell. The process is primarily triggered by the heating-induced reduction of\nthe nematic order parameter, hence realignment temperatures differ by several\ntens of degrees between LCs with high and low TNI, respectively. The\ntemperature of realignment is always lower on the positive-curved shell outside\nthan at the negative-curved inside, yielding a complex topological\nreconfiguration on heating.

These objectives motivate the desire for\nefficient safety-theoretic reasoning that can be embedded in core\ndecision-making tasks such as motion planning, particularly in constrained\nenvironments. On one hand, Monte-Carlo (MC) and other sampling-based techniques\nprovide accurate collision probability estimates for a wide variety of motion\nmodels but are cumbersome in the context of continuous optimization. On the\nother, \"direct\" approximations aim to compute (or upper-bound) the failure\nprobability as a smooth function of the decision variables, and thus are\nconvenient for optimization. However, existing direct approaches fundamentally\nassume discrete-time dynamics and can perform unpredictably when applied to\ncontinuous-time systems ubiquitous in the real world, often manifesting as\nsevere conservatism.

It is argued that acceleration of the body corresponds to vorticity\ngeneration that is independent of the instantaneous velocity of the body and\nthus the boundary condition on the normal velocity. The strength of the vortex\nsheet representing the body retains a degree of freedom that represents the net\neffect of the tangential boundary condition associated with the viscous flow\ngoverned by the higher-order Navier-Stokes equations. This degree of freedom is\nthe circulation of the vorticity generated by the acceleration of the body.\nEquivalently, it is the net circulation around a contour enclosing the body and\nany shed vorticity. In accordance with Kelvin's circulation theorem, a non-zero\nvalue of the circulation around this system is necessarily communicated to\ninfinity. This contrasts with the usual acceptance of the theorem as requiring\nthis circulation to be zero at all times; a condition that is incapable of\ncapturing the effect of newly generated vorticity on the body surface when it\naccelerates. Additionally, the usual boundary condition of continuity of normal\nvelocity is relaxed to allow for fluid entrainment into surfaces of\ndiscontinuity that represent the mass contained within the viscous layers of\nthe physical problem.

The $(U(1) \\times U(1))/Z_2$ case describes simultaneous Kondo\nbreakdown and onset of magnetic order: the two gauge fields induce nearly equal\nattractive and repulsive interactions between ghost Fermi surface excitations,\nand this competition controls the quantum criticality. Away from the transition\non the pseudogap side, the ghost Fermi surface absorbs part of the large\nelectron Fermi surface, and leads to a jump in the Hall co-efficient. We also\nfind an example of an \"unnecessary quantum critical point\" between a metal with\nspin density wave order, and a metal with local moment magnetic order. The\nghost fermions contribute an enhanced specific heat near the transition, and\ncould also be detected in other thermal probes. We relate our results to the\nphases of correlated electron compounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jun 2020 18:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 2020 21:54:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2020 17:58:25 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 2020 21:25:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-28"}

We discuss various scenarios that\nmay occur when the two temperatures approach each other and the order\nparameters of the superfluid and the liquid-gas phase transitions interact with\neach other. The simplest scenario, in which both order parameters become\ncritical at particular values of the nuclear mass, temperature, and pressure,\ncan be ruled out through on an analysis of the Landau theory.

We show that given a\npartition of natural numbers, it is possible to directly associate a metric\nwith it. Gravity emerges from patterns in partition. In the process, metric and\nmatter is unified into a fundamental notion of partition. More precisely, we\nfind a common origin of Schwarzschild metric on one hand and black-hole entropy\non the other hand. It immediately implies that information and metric are one\nand the same and any change in information is stored as change in metric. Thus\ngravitational radiation carries black-hole entropy worth of information. There\nare three novel experimental predictions. First, we can retrieve information\nfrom the gravitational radiation emitted during merger. Second, if radiation\nwith right information is sent in, black hole absorbs information and decays\ninstead of increasing in mass. This is reverse process of black hole formation.\nThird, till now only known way of observing nature is through radiation and\nfields measured far from the source. There is a completely new way of seeing\nnature if we can capture the whole partition of the source in one go.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jun 2020 18:03:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-03"}

These can then be coupled\nsequentially to thermal baths, with the innovation that a quantum field takes\nup the role of the working fluid. In particular, we propose models for\ncompression on the system to use it as a piston, and coupling to a bath that\ngives rise to a valve controlling heat flow. These models are derived within\nBogoliubov theory, which allows us to study the operational primitives\nnumerically in an efficient way. By composing the numerically modelled\noperational primitives we design complete quantum thermodynamic cycles that are\nshown to enable cooling and hence giving rise to a quantum field refrigerator.\nThe active cooling achieved in this way can operate in regimes where existing\ncooling methods become ineffective.

Our framework combines a systematic EFT approach to compute\nthe deflection angle in the PM expansion, together with the 'Boundary-to-Bound'\n(B2B) dictionary introduced in [1910.03008, 1911.09130]. Due to the nature of\nscattering processes, a remarkable reduction of complexity occurs both in the\nnumber of Feynman diagrams and type of integrals, compared to a direct EFT\ncomputation of the potential in a PM scheme. We provide two illustrative\nexamples. Firstly, we compute all the conservative gravitational observables\nfor bound orbits to 2PM, which follow from only one topology beyond leading\norder. The results agree with those in [1910.03008, 1911.09130], obtained\nthrough the 'impetus formula' applied to the classical limit of the one loop\namplitude in Cheung et al. [1808.02489]. For the sake of comparison we\nreconstruct the conservative Hamiltonian to 2PM order, which is equivalent to\nthe one derived in [1808.02489] from a matching calculation. Secondly, we\ncompute the scattering angle due to tidal effects from the electric- and\nmagnetic-type Love numbers at leading PM order. Using the B2B dictionary we\nthen obtain the tidal contribution to the periastron advance. We also construct\na Hamiltonian including tidal effects at leading PM order. Although relying on\n(relativistic) Feynman diagrams, the EFT formalism developed here does not\ninvolve taking the classical limit of a quantum amplitude, neither integrals\nwith internal massive fields, nor additional matching calculations, nor\nspurious ('super-classical') infrared singularities.

Associated with non-ideal effects, such as\nambipolar diffusion, they are known to launch a wind that could drive accretion\nin the outer part of the disc ($R> 1$ AU). They also potentially lead to\nself-organisation of the disc into large-scale axisymmetric structures, similar\nto the rings recently imaged by sub-millimetre or near-infrared instruments\n(ALMA and SPHERE). The aim of this paper is to investigate the mechanism behind\nthe formation of these gaseous rings, but also to understand the dust dynamics\nand its emission in discs threaded by a large-scale magnetic field. To this\nend, we performed global magneto-hydrodynamics (MHD) axisymmetric simulations\nwith ambipolar diffusion using a modified version of the PLUTO code. We\nexplored different magnetisations with the midplane $\\beta$ parameter ranging\nfrom $10^5$ to $10^3$ and included dust grains -- treated in the fluid\napproximation -- ranging from $100 \\mu$m to 1 cm in size. We first show that\nthe gaseous rings (associated with zonal flows) are tightly linked to the\nexistence of MHD winds. Secondly, we find that millimetre-size dust is highly\nsedimented, with a typical scale height of 1 AU at $R=100$ AU for $\\beta=10^4$,\ncompatible with recent ALMA observations. We also show that these grains\nconcentrate into pressure maxima associated with zonal flows, leading to the\nformation of dusty rings. Using the radiative transfer code MCFOST, we computed\nthe dust emission and make predictions on the ring-gap contrast and the\nspectral index that one might observe with interferometers like ALMA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jun 2020 18:34:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-22"}

Metastability is a consequence of a large separation in timescales in\nthe dynamics, leading to the existence of a regime when states of the system\nappear stationary, before eventual relaxation toward a true stationary state at\nmuch larger times. In this work, we focus on the emergence of classical\nmetastability, i.e., when metastable states of an open quantum system with\nseparation of timescales can be approximated as probabilistic mixtures of a\nfinite number of states. We find that a number of classical features follow\nfrom this approximation, for the manifold of metastable states, long-time\ndynamics between them, and symmetries of the dynamics. Namely, those states are\napproximately disjoint and thus play the role of metastable phases, the\nrelaxation toward the stationary state is approximated by a classical\nstochastic dynamics between them, and weak symmetries correspond to their\npermutations. Importantly, the classical dynamics is observed not only on\naverage, but also at the level of individual quantum trajectories: We show that\ntime coarse-grained continuous measurement records can be viewed as noisy\nclassical trajectories, while their statistics can be approximated by that of\nthe classical dynamics. Among others, this explains how first-order dynamical\nphase transitions arise from metastability. Finally, to verify the presence of\nclassical metastability in a given open quantum system, we develop an efficient\nnumerical approach that delivers the set of metastable phases together with the\neffective classical dynamics. Since the proximity to a first-order dissipative\nphase transition manifests as metastability, the theory and tools introduced in\nthis work can be used to investigate such transitions through the metastable\nbehavior of many-body systems of moderate sizes accessible to numerics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jun 2020 20:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Jul 2021 13:59:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-20"}

For agricultural applications, ML-based models designed to\nperform tasks such as autonomous plant classification will typically be coupled\nto just one or perhaps a few plant species. As a consequence, each\ncrop-specific task is very likely to require its own specialized training data,\nand the question of how to serve this need for data now often overshadows the\nmore routine exercise of actually training such models. To tackle this problem,\nwe have developed an embedded robotic system to automatically generate and\nlabel large datasets of plant images for ML applications in agriculture. The\nsystem can image plants from virtually any angle, thereby ensuring a wide\nvariety of data; and with an imaging rate of up to one image per second, it can\nproduce lableled datasets on the scale of thousands to tens of thousands of\nimages per day. As such, this system offers an important alternative to time-\nand cost-intensive methods of manual generation and labeling. Furthermore, the\nuse of a uniform background made of blue keying fabric enables additional image\nprocessing techniques such as background replacement and plant segmentation. It\nalso helps in the training process, essentially forcing the model to focus on\nthe plant features and eliminating random correlations. To demonstrate the\ncapabilities of our system, we generated a dataset of over 34,000 labeled\nimages, with which we trained an ML-model to distinguish grasses from\nnon-grasses in test data from a variety of sources.

We demonstrate with two experiments that we can achieve transparency\ntoday over disaggregated serverless resources and obtain comparable performance\nto local executions.

Herein, we\ninvestigate such transport (a form of the well-known Taylor--Aris dispersion)\nin the gap between two parallel plates, one of which oscillates vertically,\ngenerating a time-periodic squeeze flow of either a newtonian or Maxwellian\nfluid. Using the method of multiple time-scale homogenization, the mass/heat\nbalance equation describing transport in this flow is reduced to a\none-dimensional advection--diffusion--reaction equation. This result indicates\nthree effective mechanisms in the mass/heat transfer in the system: an\neffective diffusion that spreads mass/heat along the concentration/temperature\ngradient, an effective advective flux, and an effective reaction that releases\nor absorbs mass/heat - in the time-averaged frame. Our results demonstrate that\nthere exist resonant modes under which the velocity peaks when the\ndimensionless plate oscillation frequency (embodied by the Womersley number,\nthe ratio of the transient inertia to viscous forces) approaches specific\nvalues. As a result, transport in this flow is significantly influenced by the\ndimensionless frequency. On the one hand, the effective, time-averaged\ndispersion coefficient is always larger than the molecular diffusivity, and is\nsharply enhanced near resonance. The interaction between fluid elasticity and\nthe oscillatory forcing enhances the efficiency of transport in the system. On\nthe other hand, the identified effective advection and reaction mechanisms may\ntransport mass/heat from regions of high concentration/temperature to those of\nlow concentration/temperature, or vice versa, depending on the value of\ndimensionless frequency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jun 2020 20:41:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Aug 2020 21:59:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-23"}

We show new evidence for two M3 populations with distinctly\ndifferent carbon and nitrogen abundances, seen in a sharp division between\nCN-weak and CN-strong red-giant branches (RGBs) in M3. The CN-strong population\nshows a C-N anticorrelation that is a natural consequence of the CN cycle,\nwhile the CN-weak population shows no or a weak C-N anticorrelation.\nAdditionally, the CN-weak population exhibits an elongated spatial distribution\nthat is likely linked to its fast rotation.

Many local\ndensity-of-states measurements have reported signatures of the topological\nphase, however this interpretation has been challenged by alternative\nexplanations. Here, by measuring nonlocal conductance, we identify the closure\nof the excitation gap in the bulk of the semiconductor before the emergence of\nzero-bias peaks. This observation is inconsistent with scenarios where\nzero-bias peaks occur due to end-states with a trivially gapped bulk, which\nhave been extensively considered in the theoretical and experimental\nliterature. We observe that after the gap closes, nonlocal signals fluctuate\nstrongly and persist irrespective of the presence of local-conductance\nzero-bias peaks.

To effectively integrate and manage these sources,\nautomatically finding semantic matches among their schemas or ontologies is\ncrucial. Existing approaches on database matching mainly fall into two\ncategories. One focuses on the schema-level matching based on schema properties\nsuch as field names, data types, constraints and schema structures. Network\nmanagement databases contain massive tables (e.g., network products, incidents,\nsecurity alert and logs) from different departments and groups with nonuniform\nfield names and schema characteristics. It is not reliable to match them by\nthose schema properties. The other category is based on the instance-level\nmatching using general string similarity techniques, which are not applicable\nfor the matching of large network management databases. In this paper, we\ndevelop a matching technique for large NEtwork MAnagement databases (NEMA)\ndeploying instance-level matching for effective data integration and\nconnection.

We unroll an\niterative denoising algorithm by mapping each iteration into a single network\nlayer where the feed-forward process is equivalent to iteratively denoising\ngraph signals. We train the graph unrolling networks through unsupervised\nlearning, where the input noisy graph signals are used to supervise the\nnetworks. By leveraging the learning ability of neural networks, we adaptively\ncapture appropriate priors from input noisy graph signals, instead of manually\nchoosing signal priors. A core component of graph unrolling networks is the\nedge-weight-sharing graph convolution operation, which parameterizes each edge\nweight by a trainable kernel function where the trainable parameters are shared\nby all the edges. The proposed convolution is permutation-equivariant and can\nflexibly adjust the edge weights to various graph signals. We then consider two\nspecial cases of this class of networks, graph unrolling sparse coding (GUSC)\nand graph unrolling trend filtering (GUTF), by unrolling sparse coding and\ntrend filtering, respectively. To validate the proposed methods, we conduct\nextensive experiments on both real-world datasets and simulated datasets, and\ndemonstrate that our methods have smaller denoising errors than conventional\ndenoising algorithms and state-of-the-art graph neural networks.

We analyze the\nstatistical correlations between vorticity and strain rate by using a massive\ndatabase generated from very well resolved direct numerical simulations of\nforced isotropic turbulence in periodic domains. The grid resolution is up to\n$12288^3$, and the Taylor-scale Reynolds number is in the range $140-1300$. In\norder to understand the formation and structure of extreme vorticity\nfluctuations, we obtain statistics conditioned on enstrophy\n(vorticity-squared). The magnitude of strain, as well as its eigenvalues, is\napproximately constant when conditioned on weak enstrophy; whereas they grow\napproximately as power laws for strong enstrophy, which become steeper with\nincreasing $R_\\lambda$. We find that the well-known preferential alignment\nbetween vorticity and the intermediate eigenvector of strain tensor is even\nstronger for large enstrophy, whereas vorticity shows a tendency to be weakly\northogonal to the most extensive eigenvector (for large enstrophy). Yet the\ndominant contribution to the production of large enstrophy events arises from\nthe most extensive eigendirection, the more so as $R_\\lambda$ increases.\nNevertheless, the stretching in intense vorticity regions is significantly\ndepleted, consistent with the kinematic properties of weakly-curved tubes in\nwhich they are organized. Further analysis reveals that intense enstrophy is\nprimarily depleted via viscous diffusion, though viscous dissipation is also\nsignificant. Implications for modeling are nominally addressed as appropriate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jun 2020 23:27:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Sep 2020 02:59:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-13"}

This happened in parallel with advances in edge\ncomputing where videos are analyzed over hierarchical clusters that contain\nedge devices, close to the video source. However, the current video analysis\npipeline has several disadvantages when dealing with such advances. For\nexample, video encoders have been designed for a long time to please human\nviewers and be agnostic of the downstream analysis task (e.g., object\ndetection). Moreover, most of the video analytics systems leverage 2-tier\narchitecture where the encoded video is sent to either a remote cloud or a\nprivate edge server but does not efficiently leverage both of them.

However, in the presence of pulsed radar\nsignals, pilot-aided S-CSI is inaccurate since interference statistics on pilot\nand non-pilot resources can be different. Moreover, the channel will be bimodal\nas a result of the periodic interference. In this paper, we propose a max-min\nheuristic to estimate the post-equalizer SINR in the case of non-pilot pulsed\nradar interference, and characterize its distribution as a function of noise\nvariance and interference power. We observe that the proposed heuristic incurs\nlow computational complexity, and is robust beyond a certain SINR threshold for\ndifferent modulation schemes, especially for QPSK. This enables us to develop a\ncomprehensive semi-blind framework to estimate the wideband SINR metric that is\ncommonly used for S-CSI quantization in 3GPP Long-Term Evolution (LTE) and New\nRadio (NR) networks. Finally, we propose dual CSI feedback for practical\nradar-cellular spectrum sharing, to enable accurate CSI acquisition in the\nbimodal channel. We demonstrate significant improvements in throughput, block\nerror rate and retransmission-induced latency for LTE-Advanced Pro when\ncompared to conventional pilot-aided S-CSI estimation and limited feedback\nschemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2020 00:58:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-07"}

Using a continuous prior\nconcentrated near zero, the Bayesian counterparts are successful in quantifying\nthe uncertainty in the variable selection problems; nevertheless, the lack of\nexact zeros makes it difficult for broader problems such as the change-point\ndetection and rank selection. Inspired by the duality of the l1-regularization\nas a constraint onto an l1-ball, we propose a new prior by projecting a\ncontinuous distribution onto the l1-ball.

In this paper, inspired by the observation that most probing tasks\ninvolve identifying matched pairs of phrases (e.g. coreference requires\nmatching an entity and a pronoun), we propose a pairwise probe to understand\nBERT fine-tuning on the machine reading comprehension (MRC) task.

Further, we show that both the semi-discretization\n$\\{u^M\\}_{M\\in \\mathbb N}$ and the full discretization $\\{u^M_N\\}_{M,N\\in\n\\mathbb N}$ based on temporal symplectic schemes can weakly asymptotically\npreserve the LDP of $\\{B_T\\}_{T>0}$. These results show the ability of\nsymplectic discretizations to preserve the LDP of the stochastic linear \\xde\nequation, and first provide an effective approach to approximating the LDP rate\nfunction in infinite dimensional space based on the numerical discretizations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2020 02:48:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-03"}

For example, it measures the earth's quasi-static\ndistortion caused by the weight of cars (<0.8 Hz), and Rayleigh waves induced\nby earthquakes (<3 Hz) and by dynamic car-road interactions (3-20 Hz). We\ndirectly utilize the excited surface waves for shallow shear-wave velocity\ninversion. Rayleigh waves induced by passing cars have a consistent fundamental\nmode and a noisier first mode. By stacking dispersion images of 33 passing\ncars, we obtain stable dispersion images. The frequency range of the\nfundamental mode can be extended by adding the low-frequency earthquake-induced\nRayleigh waves. Thanks to the extended frequency range, we can achieve better\ndepth coverage and resolution for shear-wave velocity inversion. In order to\nassure clear separation from Love waves and aligning apparent velocity with\nphase velocity, we choose an earthquake that is approximately in line with the\narray. The inverted models match those obtained by a conventional geophone\nsurvey performed by a geotechnical service company contracted by Stanford\nUniversity using active sources from the surface until about 50 meters. In\norder to automate the Vs inversion process, we introduce a new objective\nfunction that avoids manual dispersion curve picking. We construct a 2-D Vs\nprofile by performing independent 1-D inversions at multiple locations along\nthe fiber. From the low-frequency quasi-static distortion recordings, we invert\nfor a single Poisson's ratio at each location along the fiber. We observe\nspatial heterogeneity of both Vs and Poisson's ratio profiles. Our approach is\ndramatically cheaper than ambient field interferometry and reliable estimates\ncan be obtained more frequently as no lengthy cross-correlations are required.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2020 02:50:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-03"}

Specifically, the proposed UAV\ntrajectory comprises multiple cyclical laps, each responsible for collecting\nonly a subset of data and thereby significantly reducing the\ncomputational/trajectory complexity, which allows searching for better\ntrajectory initialization that fits the buoys' topology and the wind. Numerical\nresults show that the proposed cyclical scheme outperforms the benchmark\none-flight-only scheme in general. Moreover, the optimized cyclical 8-shape\ntrajectory can proactively exploit the wind and achieve lower energy\nconsumption compared with the case without wind.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2020 03:47:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2021 03:38:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-08"}

This paper extends the resolvent\nformulation to study the effect of such anisotropic permeable substrates on\nturbulent channel flow. Under the resolvent formulation, the\nFourier-transformed Navier-Stokes equations are interpreted as a linear\nforcing-response system. The nonlinear terms are considered the endogenous\nforcing in the system that gives rise to a velocity and pressure response. A\ngain-based decomposition of the forcing-response transfer function---the\nresolvent operator---identifies response modes (resolvent modes) that are known\nto reproduce important structural and statistical features of wall-bounded\nturbulent flows. The effect of permeable substrates is introduced in this\nframework using the Volume-Averaged Navier-Stokes equations and a generalized\nform of Darcy's law. Substrates with high streamwise permeability and low\nspanwise permeability are found to suppress the forcing-response gain for the\nresolvent mode that serves as a surrogate for the energetic near-wall cycle.\nThis reduction in mode gain is shown to be consistent with the drag reduction\ntrends predicted by theory and observed in numerical simulations. Simulation\nresults indicate that drag reduction is limited by the emergence of spanwise\nrollers resembling Kelvin-Helmholtz vortices beyond a threshold value of\nwall-normal permeability. The resolvent framework also predicts the conditions\nin which such energetic spanwise-coherent rollers emerge. These findings\nsuggest that a limited set of resolvent modes can serve as the building blocks\nfor computationally-efficient models that enable the design and optimization of\npermeable substrates for passive turbulence control.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2020 04:10:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-26"}

We assume that users at the front of their lane\nare requested to declare their delay cost, i.e. value of time, and that users\nare serviced in decreasing order of declared delay cost. Since users are\nexpected to arrive dynamically at traffic intersections, static pricing\napproaches may fail to estimate user expected waiting time accurately, and lead\nto non-strategyproof payments. To address this gap, we propose two Markov chain\nmodels to determine the expected waiting time of participants in the auction.\nBoth models take into account the probability of future arrivals at the\nintersection. In a first model, we assume that the probability of future\narrivals is uniform across lanes of the intersection. This queue-based model\nonly tracks the number of lower- and higher-bidding users on access lanes, and\nthe number of empty lanes. The uniformness assumption is relaxed in a second,\nlane-based model which accounts for lane-specific user arrival probabilities at\nthe expense of an extended state space.

Existing confidence intervals for causal effects\nbased on instrumental variables assume that all of the putative instrumental\nvariables are valid; a valid instrumental variable is a variable that affects\nthe outcome only by affecting the treatment and is not related to unmeasured\nconfounders. However, in practice, some of the putative instrumental variables\nare likely to be invalid. This paper presents two tools to conduct valid\ninference and tests in the presence of invalid instruments. First, we propose a\nsimple and general approach to construct confidence intervals based on taking\nunions of well-known confidence intervals. Second, we propose a novel test for\nthe null causal effect based on a collider bias.

In this paper, we outline three ways\nan attacker can steal funds from honest LN users. The attacks require dilating\nthe time for victims to become aware of new blocks by eclipsing (isolating)\nvictims from the network and delaying block delivery. While our focus is on the\nLN, time-dilation attacks may be relevant to any second-layer protocol that\nrelies on a timely reaction.\n  According to our measurements, it is currently possible to steal the total\nchannel capacity by keeping a node eclipsed for as little as 2 hours. Since\ntrust-minimized Bitcoin light clients currently connect to a very limited\nnumber of random nodes, running just 500 Sybil nodes allows an attacker to\nEclipse 47\\% of newly deployed light clients (and hence prime them for an\nattack). As for the victims running a full node, since they are often used by\nlarge hubs or service providers, an attacker may justify the higher Eclipse\nattack cost by stealing all their available liquidity.\n  In addition, time-dilation attacks neither require access to hashrate nor\npurchasing from a victim. Thus, this class of attacks is a more practical way\nof stealing funds via Eclipse attacks than previously anticipated\ndouble-spending.\n  We argue that simple detection techniques based on the slow block arrival\nalone are not effective, and implementing more sophisticated detection is not\ntrivial.

The two solvers are\ncoupled directly through deposition rates of the free particles calculated\nusing the mean first passage time (MFPT) of deposition that is found to scale\nas $r^{-4}$. Two variants are studied: ignoring (radial) and not ignoring the\nline of sight (pathfinding).

Moreover, our\nexperiments show that the underlying loss function of CW, which is criticized\nfor being substantially slower than other adversarial attacks, is not that much\nslower than other loss functions. Finally, we analyze how well neural networks\ncan identify adversarial perturbations generated by the attacks under\nconsideration, hereby revisiting the idea of adversarial retraining on\nImageNet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2020 08:51:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-03"}

However, due to inadequate testing, DApps are easily\nexposed to serious vulnerabilities. We find three main challenges for DApp\ntesting, i.e., the inherent complexity of DApp, inconvenient pre-state setting,\nand not-so-readable logs. In this paper, we propose a testing framework named\nKaya to bridge these gaps. Kaya has three main functions. Firstly, Kaya\nproposes DApp behavior description language (DBDL) to make writing test cases\neasier. Test cases written in DBDL can also be automatically executed by Kaya.\nSecondly, Kaya supports a flexible and convenient way for test engineers to set\nthe blockchain pre-states easily. Thirdly, Kaya transforms incomprehensible\naddresses into readable variables for easy comprehension. With these functions,\nKaya can help test engineers test DApps more easily. Besides, to fit the\nvarious application environments, we provide two ways for test engineers to use\nKaya, i.e., UI and command-line. Our experimental case demonstrates the\npotential of Kaya in helping test engineers to test DApps more easily.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2020 09:22:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-03"}

Given a set of pointers, the task is to produce a useful\nover-approximation of the memory locations that each pointer may point-to at\nruntime. The most common formulation is Andersen's Pointer Analysis (APA),\ndefined as an inclusion-based set of $m$ pointer constraints over a set of $n$\npointers. Existing algorithms solve APA in $O(n^2\\cdot m)$ time, while it has\nbeen conjectured that the problem has no truly sub-cubic algorithm, with a\nproof so far having remained elusive.\n  In this work we draw a rich fine-grained and parallel complexity landscape of\nAPA, and present upper and lower bounds. First, we establish an $O(n^3)$\nupper-bound for general APA, improving over $O(n^2\\cdot m)$ as $n=O(m)$.\nSecond, we show that even on-demand APA (\"may a specific pointer $a$ point to a\nspecific location $b$?\") has an $\\Omega(n^3)$ (combinatorial) lower bound under\nstandard complexity-theoretic hypotheses. This formally establishes the\nlong-conjectured \"cubic bottleneck\" of APA, and shows that our $O(n^3)$-time\nalgorithm is optimal. Third, we show that under mild restrictions, APA is\nsolvable in $\\tilde{O}(n^{\\omega})$ time, where $\\omega<2.373$ is the\nmatrix-multiplication exponent. It is believed that $\\omega=2+o(1)$, in which\ncase this bound becomes quadratic.

We introduce a novel neural-network based machine learning algorithm\nthat uses time series strain data from gravitational-wave detectors to detect\nsignals from non-spinning binary neutron star mergers. For the Advanced LIGO\ndesign sensitivity, our network has an average sensitive distance of 130 Mpc at\na false-alarm rate of 10 per month. Compared to other state-of-the-art machine\nlearning algorithms, we find an improvement by a factor of 6 in sensitivity to\nsignals with signal-to-noise ratio below 25. However, this approach is not yet\ncompetitive with traditional matched-filtering based methods. A conservative\nestimate indicates that our algorithm introduces on average 10.2 s of latency\nbetween signal arrival and generating an alert. We give an exact description of\nour testing procedure, which can not only be applied to machine learning based\nalgorithms but all other search algorithms as well.

On the one hand, we are interested in\ndeveloping applications using non-determinism as underlying implementation\nidea. We discuss two applications using the functional logic programming\nlanguage Curry. The key idea of these implementations is to exploit the\ninterplay of non-determinism and non-strictness that Curry employs. The first\napplication investigates sorting algorithms parametrised over a comparison\nfunction. By applying a non-deterministic predicate to these sorting functions,\nwe gain a permutation enumeration function. We compare the implementation in\nCurry with an implementation in Haskell that uses a monadic interface to model\nnon-determinism. The other application that we discuss in this work is a\nlibrary for probabilistic programming. Instead of modelling distributions as\nlist of event and probability pairs, we model distributions using Curry's\nbuilt-in non-determinism. In both cases we observe that the combination of\nnon-determinism and non-strictness has advantages over an implementation using\nlists to model non-determinism. On the other hand, we present an idea to apply\nformal reasoning on effectful declarative programming languages. In order to\nstart with simple effects, we focus on modelling a functional subset first.\nThat is, the effects of interest are totality and partiality. We then observe\nthat the general scheme to model these two effects can be generalised to\ncapture a wide range of effects. Obviously, the next step is to apply the idea\nto model non-determinism. More precisely, we implement a model for the\nnon-determinism of Curry: non-strict non-determinism with call-time choice.\nTherefore, we finally discuss why the current representation models\ncall-by-name rather than Curry's call-by-need semantics and give an outlook on\nideas to tackle this problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2020 11:33:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-03"}

Although the\nessential requirements and key usage scenarios of 6G are yet to be defined, it\nis believed that 6G should be able to provide intelligent and ubiquitous\nwireless connectivity with Tbps data rate and sub-millisecond latency over 3D\nnetwork coverage. To achieve such goals, acquiring accurate location\ninformation of the mobile terminals is becoming extremely useful, not only for\nlocation-based services but also for improving wireless communication\nperformance in various ways such as channel estimation, beam alignment, medium\naccess control, routing, and network optimization. On the other hand, the\nadvancement of communication technologies also brings new opportunities to\ngreatly improve the localization performance, as exemplified by the anticipated\ncentimeter-level localization accuracy in 6G by ultra massive MIMO and mmWave\ntechnologies. In this regard, a unified study on integrated localization and\ncommunication (ILAC) is necessary to unlock the full potential of wireless\nnetworks for the best utilization of network infrastructure and radio resources\nfor dual purposes.

The existence of a 1- resonance at\nlow excitation energies is confirmed, but the associated E1 transition from the\nground state does not have an isoscalar character, as suggested in a recent\nexperiment. In a second step, I study the 11Li + p elastic cross section at\nElab = 66 MeV in the CDCC framework.

From CDCC equivalent 11Li + p\nand 11Li + n potentials, I explore the 11Li + d cross section within a standard\nthree-body 11Li +(p + n) model. At small angles, the experimental cross section\nis close to the Rutherford scattering cross section, which is not supported by\nthe CDCC. A five-body (9Li+n+n)+(p+n) is then performed.

We also\nformulated 5 different MIL tasks on a real world lymph node metastases dataset.\nWe found that the performance of our framework in a task is different for\ndifferent filters. We also observed that the performances of the five pooling\nfilters are also different from task to task. Hence, the selection of a correct\nMIL pooling filter for each MIL task is crucial for better performance.\nFurthermore, we noticed that models with `distribution' and `distribution with\nattention' pooling filters consistently perform well in almost all of the\ntasks. We attribute this phenomena to the amount of information captured by\n`distribution' based pooling filters. While point estimate based pooling\nfilters, like `max' and `mean', produce point estimates of distributions,\n`distribution' based pooling filters capture the full information in\ndistributions. Lastly, we compared the performance of our neural network model\nwith `distribution' pooling filter with the performance of the best MIL methods\nin the literature on classical MIL datasets and our model outperformed the\nothers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2020 12:33:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-03"}

It is\nnevertheless clear that useful information for the task can often be found\noutside of the scope of a single-sentence context. Recently proposed\nself-attention models such as BERT can both efficiently capture long-distance\nrelationships in input as well as represent inputs consisting of several\nsentences, creating new opportunitites for approaches that incorporate\ncross-sentence information in natural language processing tasks. In this paper,\nwe present a systematic study exploring the use of cross-sentence information\nfor NER using BERT models in five languages. We find that adding context in the\nform of additional sentences to BERT input systematically increases NER\nperformance on all of the tested languages and models. Including multiple\nsentences in each input also allows us to study the predictions of the same\nsentences in different contexts. We propose a straightforward method,\nContextual Majority Voting (CMV), to combine different predictions for\nsentences and demonstrate this to further increase NER performance with BERT.\nOur approach does not require any changes to the underlying BERT architecture,\nrather relying on restructuring examples for training and prediction.\nEvaluation on established datasets, including the CoNLL'02 and CoNLL'03 NER\nbenchmarks, demonstrates that our proposed approach can improve on the\nstate-of-the-art NER results on English, Dutch, and Finnish, achieves the best\nreported BERT-based results on German, and is on par with performance reported\nwith other BERT-based approaches in Spanish.

Extending the\nspectral representation of max-stable processes, our modeling framework relies\non a novel construction of max-infinitely divisible processes, which include\ncovariates to capture spatio-temporal non-stationarities. Our new model keeps a\npopular max-stable process on the boundary of the parameter space, while\nflexibly capturing weakening extremal dependence at increasing quantile levels\nand asymptotic independence.

One approach in this setting is to modularize the model,\nand prevent feedback from suspect modules, using a cut model. After observing\ndata, this leads to the cut distribution which normally does not have a\nclosed-form. Previous studies have proposed algorithms to sample from this\ndistribution, but these algorithms have unclear theoretical convergence\nproperties. To address this, we propose a new algorithm called the Stochastic\nApproximation Cut algorithm (SACut) as an alternative. The algorithm is divided\ninto two parallel chains. The main chain targets an approximation to the cut\ndistribution; the auxiliary chain is used to form an adaptive proposal\ndistribution for the main chain. We prove convergence of the samples drawn by\nthe proposed algorithm and present the exact limit. Although SACut is biased,\nsince the main chain does not target the exact cut distribution, we prove this\nbias can be reduced geometrically by increasing a user-chosen tuning parameter.\nIn addition, parallel computing can be easily adopted for SACut, which greatly\nreduces computation time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2020 13:19:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 03:19:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 22 Apr 2021 12:20:09 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 9 Nov 2021 22:17:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-11"}

Why are forecasts or predictions made by so-called\nexperts often grossly wrong, concerning the numbers of people who get infected\nor die? The purpose of this study is to better understand the stochastic nature\nof an epidemic disease, and answer the above questions. Much of the work on\ninfectious diseases has been based on \"SIR deterministic models,\" (Kermack and\nMcKendrick:1927.) We will explore stochastic models that can capture the\nessence of the seemingly erratic behavior of an infectious disease. A\nstochastic model, in its formulation, takes into account the random nature of\nan infectious disease.\n  The stochastic model we study here is based on the \"birth-and-death process\nwith immigration\" (BDI for short), which was proposed in the study of\npopulation growth or extinction of some biological species. The BDI process\nmodel ,however, has not been investigated by the epidemiology community. The\nBDI process is one of a few birth-and-death processes, which we can solve\nanalytically. Its time-dependent probability distribution function is a\n\"negative binomial distribution\" with its parameter $r$ less than $1$. The\n\"coefficient of variation\" of the process is larger than $\\sqrt{1/r} > 1$.\nFurthermore, it has a long tail like the zeta distribution. These properties\nexplain why infection patterns exhibit enormously large variations. The number\nof infected predicted by a deterministic model is much greater than the median\nof the distribution. This explains why any forecast based on a deterministic\nmodel will fail more often than not.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2020 13:25:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-03"}

It has many important\nalgorithmic applications because many NP-hard problems on general graphs become\ntractable when restricted to graphs of bounded treewidth. Algorithms for\nproblems on graphs of bounded treewidth mostly are dynamic programming\nalgorithms using the structure of a tree decomposition of the graph. The\nbottleneck in the worst-case run time of these algorithms often is the\ncomputations for the so called join nodes in the associated nice tree\ndecomposition.\n  In this paper, we review two different approaches that have appeared in the\nliterature about computations for the join nodes: one using fast zeta and\nM\\\"obius transforms and one using fast Fourier transforms. We combine these\napproaches to obtain new, faster algorithms for a broad class of vertex subset\nproblems known as the [\\sigma,\\rho]-domination problems. Our main result is\nthat we show how to solve [\\sigma,\\rho]-domination problems in $O(s^{t+2} t n^2\n(t\\log(s)+\\log(n)))$ arithmetic operations. Here, t is the treewidth, s is the\n(fixed) number of states required to represent partial solutions of the\nspecific [\\sigma,\\rho]-domination problem, and n is the number of vertices in\nthe graph. This reduces the polynomial factors involved compared to the\npreviously best time bound (van Rooij, Bodlaender, Rossmanith, ESA 2009) of $O(\ns^{t+2} (st)^{2(s-2)} n^3 )$ arithmetic operations.

The goal is to find an\noptimal solution among a finite set of possibilities. The well-known challenge\none faces with combinatorial optimization is the state-space explosion problem:\nthe number of possibilities grows exponentially with the problem size, which\nmakes solving intractable for large problems. In the last years, deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL) has shown its promise for designing good\nheuristics dedicated to solve NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems.\nHowever, current approaches have two shortcomings: (1) they mainly focus on the\nstandard travelling salesman problem and they cannot be easily extended to\nother problems, and (2) they only provide an approximate solution with no\nsystematic ways to improve it or to prove optimality. In another context,\nconstraint programming (CP) is a generic tool to solve combinatorial\noptimization problems. Based on a complete search procedure, it will always\nfind the optimal solution if we allow an execution time large enough. A\ncritical design choice, that makes CP non-trivial to use in practice, is the\nbranching decision, directing how the search space is explored. In this work,\nwe propose a general and hybrid approach, based on DRL and CP, for solving\ncombinatorial optimization problems. The core of our approach is based on a\ndynamic programming formulation, that acts as a bridge between both techniques.\nWe experimentally show that our solver is efficient to solve two challenging\nproblems: the traveling salesman problem with time windows, and the 4-moments\nportfolio optimization problem. Results obtained show that the framework\nintroduced outperforms the stand-alone RL and CP solutions, while being\ncompetitive with industrial solvers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2020 13:54:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-03"}

Given a set\nof observables (e.g., actions and interactions between agents), our model can\nrecover the most-likely latent opinion trajectories that are compatible with\nthe assumptions about the process dynamics. This type of model retains the\nbenefits of agent-based ones (i.e., causal interpretation), while adding the\nability to perform model selection and hypothesis testing on real data.\n  We showcase our proposal by translating a classical agent-based model of\nopinion dynamics into its generative counterpart. We then design an inference\nalgorithm based on online expectation maximization to learn the latent\nparameters of the model. Such algorithm can recover the latent opinion\ntrajectories from traces generated by the classical agent-based model. In\naddition, it can identify the most likely set of macro parameters used to\ngenerate a data trace, thus allowing testing of sociological hypotheses.\nFinally, we apply our model to real-world data from Reddit to explore the\nlong-standing question about the impact of backfire effect. Our results suggest\na low prominence of the effect in Reddit's political conversation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2020 14:48:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-03"}

This implies compliance with key\nperformance indicators (KPIs) required by applications. Key performance\nindicators at the application level are throughput, download time, round trip\ntime, and video delay. They depend on the end-to-end connection between the\nserver and the end-user device. For VHC networks, Telco operators must provide\nthe required application quality. Moreover, they must meet the objectives of\neconomic sustainability. Today, Telco operators rarely achieve the above\nobjectives, mainly due to the push to increase the bit-rate of access networks\nwithout considering the end-to-end KPIs of the applications. The main\ncontribution of this paper concerns the definition of a deployment framework to\naddress performance and cost issues for VHC networks. We show three actions on\nwhich it is necessary to focus. First, limiting bit-rate through video\ncompression. Second, contain the rate of packet loss through artificial\nintelligence algorithms for line stabilization. Third, reduce latency (i.e.,\nround-trip time) with edge-cloud computing. The concerted and gradual\napplication of these measures can allow a Telco to get out of the\nultra-broadband \"trap\" of the access network, as defined in the paper. We\npropose to work on end-to-end optimization of the bandwidth utilization ratio.\nThis leads to a better performance experienced by the end-user.

Motile\nmicrobes, equipped with ATP-fueled engines, are prime examples of such\nphase-separating active matter, which is fundamental in myriad biological\nprocesses. The fact that spontaneous spatial aggregation is not widely\nrecognized as a general feature of microbial communities challenges the\ngeneralisation of phase separation beyond artificial active systems.

Its spectral\nsensitivity suggests that microbial motility and phase separation are regulated\nby the activity of the photosynthetic machinery. Characteristic fingerprints of\nthe stability and dynamics of this active system paint a picture that cannot be\nreconciled with the current physical understanding of phase separation in\nartificial active matter, whereby collective behavior can emerge from inherent\nmotility modulation in response to changing stimuli.

Surprisingly,\nthough, a deep understanding of the mechanisms that lead to this universal\nbehavior seems to be lacking. Moreover, this observation is difficult to\nreconcile with the fact that a single, isolated atom is known to have a giant\noptical response, as characterized by a resonant scattering cross section that\nfar exceeds its physical size. Here, we theoretically and numerically\ninvestigate the evolution of the optical properties of an ensemble of ideal\natoms as a function of density, starting from the dilute gas limit, including\nthe effects of multiple scattering and near-field interactions. Interestingly,\ndespite the giant response of an isolated atom, we find that the maximum index\ndoes not indefinitely grow with increasing density, but rather reaches a\nlimiting value $n\\approx 1.7$. We propose an explanation based upon\nstrong-disorder renormalization group theory, in which the near-field\ninteraction combined with random atomic positions results in an inhomogeneous\nbroadening of atomic resonance frequencies. This mechanism ensures that\nregardless of the physical atomic density, light at any given frequency only\ninteracts with at most a few near-resonant atoms per cubic wavelength, thus\nlimiting the maximum index attainable.

For example, between planet 55 Cnc-f and 55~Cnc-d,\nthe comets do not undergo close cometary encounters akin to Earth and Mars in\nthe Solar System as the planetary masses in the 55 Cnc system are much larger\nthan in the Solar System and therefore the comets are much less orbitally\nstable. Nevertheless, we expect an increased number of comet-planet encounters\nas well as cometary collisions in the 0.8 / 5.7 au gap. Future observations and\nadditional theoretical studies are required to shed light on the possibility of\nhabitable terrestrial planets in the 55 Cnc system, including the possible\nrole(s) of exocomets in the facilitation of planetary habitability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2020 15:29:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-24"}

Such methods have their\nlimitations which may bring potential security risks. Firstly, with the\nincrease of embedding rate, these models will choose words with lower\nconditional probability, which will reduce the quality of the generated\nsteganographic texts; secondly, they can not control the semantic expression of\nthe final generated steganographic text. This paper proposes a new text\ngenerative steganography method which is quietly different from the existing\nmodels. We use a Knowledge Graph (KG) to guide the generation of steganographic\nsentences. On the one hand, we hide the secret information by coding the path\nin the knowledge graph, but not the conditional probability of each generated\nword; on the other hand, we can control the semantic expression of the\ngenerated steganographic text to a certain extent. The experimental results\nshow that the proposed model can guarantee both the quality of the generated\ntext and its semantic expression, which is a supplement and improvement to the\ncurrent text generation steganography.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2020 06:53:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-16"}

It requires a machine learning model to process sentiment and\nto perform opinion mining. In this work, I've exploited a recently released\ndataset for span-selection Question Answering, namely SubjQA. SubjQA is the\nfirst QA dataset that contains questions that ask for subjective opinions\ncorresponding to review paragraphs from six different domains. Hence, to answer\nthese subjective questions, a learner must extract opinions and process\nsentiment for various domains, and additionally, align the knowledge extracted\nfrom a paragraph with the natural language utterances in the corresponding\nquestion, which together enhance the difficulty of a QA task. The primary goal\nof this thesis was to investigate the inner workings (i.e., latent\nrepresentations) of a Transformer-based architecture to contribute to a better\nunderstanding of these not yet well understood \"black-box\" models.\nTransformer's hidden representations, concerning the true answer span, are\nclustered more closely in vector space than those representations corresponding\nto erroneous predictions. This observation holds across the top three\nTransformer layers for both objective and subjective questions and generally\nincreases as a function of layer dimensions. Moreover, the probability to\nachieve a high cosine similarity among hidden representations in latent space\nconcerning the true answer span tokens is significantly higher for correct\ncompared to incorrect answer span predictions. These results have decisive\nimplications for down-stream applications, where it is crucial to know about\nwhy a neural network made mistakes, and in which point, in space and time the\nmistake has happened (e.g., to automatically predict correctness of an answer\nspan prediction without the necessity of labeled data).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2020 13:48:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Oct 2020 07:47:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-15"}

Current sea ice models, however, predict more\nice than is observed in the Arctic, and less in the Antarctic. Improving the\nfit of these physics-based models to observations is challenging because the\nmodels are expensive to run, and therefore expensive to optimize. Here, we\nconstruct a machine learning surrogate that emulates the effect of changing\nmodel physics on forecasts of sea ice area from the Los Alamos Sea Ice Model\n(CICE). We use the surrogate model to investigate the sensitivity of CICE to\nchanges in the parameters governing: ice's ridging and albedo; snow's albedo,\naging, and thermal conductivity; the effect of meltwater on albedo; and the\neffect of ponds on albedo. We find that CICE's sensitivity to these model\nparameters differs between hemispheres. We propose that future sea ice modelers\nseparate the snow conductivity and snow grain size distributions on a seasonal\nand inter-hemispheric basis, and we recommend optimal values of these\nparameters. This will make it possible to make models that fit observations of\nboth Arctic and Antarctic sea ice more closely. These results demonstrate that\nimportant aspects of the behavior of a leading sea ice model can be captured by\na relatively simple support vector regression surrogate model, and that this\nsurrogate dramatically increases the ease of tuning the full simulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jun 2020 19:42:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-24"}

Different from standard\nGANs, the training term is no longer the true data and the generated data, but\nrather their residuals.
