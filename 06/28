However, the largest portion of the ocean - the deep sea - still\nremains mostly unexplored. Only relatively few image sets have been taken from\nthe deep sea due to the physical limitations caused by technical challenges and\nenormous costs. Deep sea images are very different from the images taken in\nshallow waters and this area did not get much attention from the community. The\nshortage of deep sea images and the corresponding ground truth data for\nevaluation and training is becoming a bottleneck for the development of\nunderwater computer vision methods. Thus, this paper presents a physical\nmodel-based image simulation solution, which uses an in-air texture and depth\ninformation as inputs, to generate underwater image sequences taken by robots\nin deep ocean scenarios. Different from shallow water conditions, artificial\nillumination plays a vital role in deep sea image formation as it strongly\naffects the scene appearance. Our radiometric image formation model considers\nboth attenuation and scattering effects with co-moving spotlights in the dark.\nBy detailed analysis and evaluation of the underwater image formation model, we\npropose a 3D lookup table structure in combination with a novel rendering\nstrategy to improve simulation performance.

More recently, many complex systems\nare being represented by time-varying, multilayer, and time-varying multilayer\nnetworks, i.e. multidimensional (or high order) networks. Nevertheless, it is\nwell-known that the aggregation process may create spurious paths on the\naggregated view of such multidimensional (high order) networks. Consequently,\nthese spurious paths may then cause shortest-path based centrality metrics to\nproduce incorrect results, thus undermining the network centrality analysis. In\nthis context, we propose a method able to avoid taking into account spurious\npaths when computing centralities based on shortest paths in multidimensional\n(or high order) networks. Our method is based on MultiAspect Graphs~(MAG) to\nrepresent the multidimensional networks and we show that well-known centrality\nalgorithms can be straightforwardly adapted to the MAG environment. Moreover,\nwe show that, by using this MAG representation, pitfalls usually associated\nwith spurious paths resulting from aggregation in multidimensional networks can\nbe avoided at the time of the aggregation process. As a result, shortest-path\nbased centralities are assured to be computed correctly for multidimensional\nnetworks, without taking into account spurious paths that could otherwise lead\nto incorrect results. We also present a case study that shows the impact of\nspurious paths in the computing of shortest paths and consequently of\nshortest-path based centralities, such as betweenness and closeness, thus\nillustrating the importance of this contribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 27 Jun 2020 16:36:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 19 Aug 2020 12:23:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-20"}

Currently available methods to fabricate the NV center\noften involve complex processes such as N implantation. By contrast, in a\ndiamond-like compound C3BN, creating a boron (B) vacancy immediately leads to\nan NV center analog. We use the strongly constrained and appropriately normed\n(SCAN) semilocal density functional - this functional leads to nearly the same\nzero-phonon line (ZPL) energy as the experiment and as obtained from the more\ntime-consuming hybrid density functional calculations - to explore the\npotential of this NV center analog as a novel spin qubit for applications in\nquantum information processing.

Tree models, which formulate targets as leaves of a\ntree with trainable node-wise scorers, have attracted a lot of interests in\ntackling this challenge due to their logarithmic computational complexity in\nboth training and testing. Tree-based deep models (TDMs) and probabilistic\nlabel trees (PLTs) are two representative kinds of them. Though achieving many\npractical successes, existing tree models suffer from the training-testing\ndiscrepancy, where the retrieval performance deterioration caused by beam\nsearch in testing is not considered in training.

Thus, knowing, in addition to patterns' frequencies, for how\nlong and how regularly they have occurred---i.e., their persistence---can add\nto our understanding of evolving networks. In this work, we propose the problem\nof mining activity that persists through time in continually evolving\nnetworks---i.e., activity that repeatedly and consistently occurs. We extend\nthe notion of temporal motifs to capture activity among specific nodes, in what\nwe call activity snippets, which are small sequences of edge-updates that\nreoccur. We propose axioms and properties that a measure of persistence should\nsatisfy, and develop such a persistence measure.

We apply PENminer\nto numerous real, large-scale evolving networks and edge streams, and find\nactivity that is surprisingly regular over a long period of time, but too\ninfrequent to be discovered by aggregate count alone, and bursts of activity\nexposed by their lack of persistence. Our findings with PENminer include\nneighborhoods in NYC where taxi traffic persisted through Hurricane Sandy, the\nopening of new bike-stations, characteristics of social network users, and\nmore.

In this paper, we study\ncombinatorial information measures that generalize independence, (conditional)\nentropy, (conditional) mutual information, and total correlation defined over\nsets of (not necessarily random) variables. These measures strictly generalize\nthe corresponding entropic measures since they are all parameterized via\nsubmodular functions that themselves strictly generalize entropy. Critically,\nwe show that, unlike entropic mutual information in general, the submodular\nmutual information is actually submodular in one argument, holding the other\nfixed, for a large class of submodular functions whose third-order partial\nderivatives satisfy a non-negativity property.

A key step in each private SGD update is gradient clipping that\nshrinks the gradient of an individual example whenever its L2 norm exceeds some\nthreshold. We first demonstrate how gradient clipping can prevent SGD from\nconverging to stationary point. We then provide a theoretical analysis that\nfully quantifies the clipping bias on convergence with a disparity measure\nbetween the gradient distribution and a geometrically symmetric distribution.\nOur empirical evaluation further suggests that the gradient distributions along\nthe trajectory of private SGD indeed exhibit symmetric structure that favors\nconvergence.

These emergent scenarios require a cooperative team to quickly\nterminate the current task and transit the system to a new task, bringing\ndifficulty in motion planning. Moreover, due to the immediate task transitions,\nuncertainty from both physical systems and prior tasks is accumulated to\ndecrease swarm performance, causing robot failures and influencing the\ncooperation effectiveness between the human and the robot swarm. Therefore,\ngiven the quick-transition requirements and the introduced uncertainty, it is\nchallenging for a human-swarm system to respond to emergent tasks, compared\nwith executing normal tasks where a gradual transition between tasks is\nallowed. Human trust reveals the behavior expectations of others and is used to\nadjust unsatisfactory behaviors for better cooperation. Inspired by human\ntrust, in this paper, a trust-aware reflective control (Trust-R) is developed\nto dynamically calibrate human-swarm cooperation.

The latter is obtained by using a double\nperturbation asymptotic development both in the core flow and in the Hartmann\nlayers arising along the planes. A new model is thus built that describes\ninertial effects in these two regions. Two separate classes of phenomena are\nthus pointed out : the one related to inertial effects in the Hartmann layer\ngives a model for recirculating flows and the other introduces the possibility\nof having a transverse dependence of the velocity profile in the core flow. The\n''recirculating'' velocity profile is then introduced in the transversally\naveraged equation of motion in order to provide an effective 2D equation of\nmotion.

However, high densities of intrinsic defects in these materials\nnot only cause bulk metallic conductivity, preventing the measurement of\nquantum transport in surface states, but may also affect magnetism and\ntopological properties. In this paper, we show by density functional theory\ncalculations that the strain induced by the internal heterostructure promotes\nthe formation of large-size-mismatched antisite defect BiMn in MnBi2Te4; such\nstrain is further enhanced in MnBi4Te7, giving rise to even higher BiMn\ndensity. The abundance of intrinsic BiMn donors results in degenerate n-type\nconductivity under the Te-poor growth condition. Our calculations suggest that\ngrowths in a Te-rich condition can lower the Fermi level, which is supported by\nour transport measurements. We further show that the internal strain can also\nenable efficient doping by large-size-mismatched substitutional NaMn acceptors,\nwhich can compensate BiMn donors and lower the Fermi level.

It brings new\nchallenges of distinguishing between many classes given only a few training\nsamples per class. In this paper, we leverage the class hierarchy as a prior\nknowledge to train a coarse-to-fine classifier that can produce accurate\npredictions for MCFS problem in both settings. The propose model,\n\"memory-augmented hierarchical-classification network (MahiNet)\", performs\ncoarse-to-fine classification where each coarse class can cover multiple fine\nclasses. Since it is challenging to directly distinguish a variety of fine\nclasses given few-shot data per class, MahiNet starts from learning a\nclassifier over coarse-classes with more training data whose labels are much\ncheaper to obtain. The coarse classifier reduces the searching range over the\nfine classes and thus alleviates the challenges from \"many classes\". On\narchitecture, MahiNet firstly deploys a convolutional neural network (CNN) to\nextract features.

It is found metallic TiN and HfN hold anomalous thermal transport\nbehaviors compared to common metals and nonmetallic TMNs. They have extremely\nlarge intrinsic phonon thermal conductivity mainly due to the large\nacoustic-optic phonon frequency gaps. The phonon thermal conductivity is\nreduced by two orders of magnitude as the phonon-isotope and phonon-electron\nscatterings are considered, which also induce the nontrivial\ntemperature-independent behavior of phonon thermal conductivity. Nesting Fermi\nsurfaces exist in both TiN and HfN, which cause the strong electron-phonon\ncoupling strengths and heavily harm the transport of phonons and electrons. The\nphonon component takes an abnormally large ratio in total thermal conductivity,\nas 29% for TiN and 26% for HfN at 300 K.

This work deals with pick-and-constrained placement of\nobjects without access to geometric models. The objective is to pick an object\nand place it safely inside a desired goal region without any collisions, while\nminimizing the time and the sensing operations required to complete the task.\nAn algorithmic framework is proposed for this purpose, which performs\nmanipulation planning simultaneously over a conservative and an optimistic\nestimate of the object's volume. The conservative estimate ensures that the\nmanipulation is safe while the optimistic estimate guides the sensor-based\nmanipulation process when no solution can be found for the conservative\nestimate. To maintain these estimates and dynamically update them during\nmanipulation, objects are represented by a simple volumetric representation,\nwhich stores sets of occupied and unseen voxels. The effectiveness of the\nproposed approach is demonstrated by developing a robotic system that picks a\npreviously unseen object from a table-top and places it in a constrained space.\nThe system comprises of a dual-arm manipulator with heterogeneous end-effectors\nand leverages hand-offs as a re-grasping strategy.

Specifically, we propose to replace the fully connected\nclassification head of DCNNs with a differentiable compositional model that can\nbe trained end-to-end. The structure of the compositional model enables\nCompositionalNets to decompose images into objects and context, as well as to\nfurther decompose object representations in terms of individual parts and the\nobjects' pose.

Many different schemes have been proposed for the restoration of\nintensity SAR images. Among the different possible approaches, methods based on\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) have recently shown to reach\nstate-of-the-art performance for SAR image restoration. CNN training requires\ngood training data: many pairs of speckle-free / speckle-corrupted images. This\nis an issue in SAR applications, given the inherent scarcity of speckle-free\nimages. To handle this problem, this paper analyzes different strategies one\ncan adopt, depending on the speckle removal task one wishes to perform and the\navailability of multitemporal stacks of SAR data. The first strategy applies a\nCNN model, trained to remove additive white Gaussian noise from natural images,\nto a recently proposed SAR speckle removal framework: MuLoG (MUlti-channel\nLOgarithm with Gaussian denoising). No training on SAR images is performed, the\nnetwork is readily applied to speckle reduction tasks. The second strategy\nconsiders a novel approach to construct a reliable dataset of speckle-free SAR\nimages necessary to train a CNN model. Finally, a hybrid approach is also\nanalyzed: the CNN used to remove additive white Gaussian noise is trained on\nspeckle-free SAR images. The proposed methods are compared to other\nstate-of-the-art speckle removal filters, to evaluate the quality of denoising\nand to discuss the pros and cons of the different strategies.

We propose an answer ranking model named MUSE which\ncarefully models multiple semantic relations among the question, answers, and\nrelevant reviews. Specifically, MUSE constructs a multi-semantic relation graph\nwith the question, each answer, and each review snippet as nodes. Then a\ncustomized graph convolutional neural network is designed for explicitly\nmodeling the semantic relevance between the question and answers, the content\nconsistency among answers, and the textual entailment between answers and\nreviews. Extensive experiments on real-world E-commerce datasets across three\nproduct categories show that our proposed model achieves superior performance\non the concerned answer ranking task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Jun 2020 13:26:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-30"}

However, there are several limitations of the existing\nuncertainty estimation methods for anchor-based object detection. 1) They model\nthe uncertainty of the heterogeneous object properties with different\ncharacteristics and scales, such as location (center point) and scale (width,\nheight), which could be difficult to estimate. 2) They model box offsets as\nGaussian distributions, which is not compatible with the ground truth bounding\nboxes that follow the Dirac delta distribution. 3) Since anchor-based methods\nare sensitive to anchor hyper-parameters, their localization uncertainty could\nalso be highly sensitive to the choice of hyper-parameters. To tackle these\nlimitations, we propose a new localization uncertainty estimation method called\nUAD for anchor-free object detection. Our method captures the uncertainty in\nfour directions of box offsets (left, right, top, bottom) that are homogeneous,\nso that it can tell which direction is uncertain, and provide a quantitative\nvalue of uncertainty in [0, 1]. To enable such uncertainty estimation, we\ndesign a new uncertainty loss, negative power log-likelihood loss, to measure\nthe localization uncertainty by weighting the likelihood loss by its IoU, which\nalleviates the model misspecification problem. Furthermore, we propose an\nuncertainty-aware focal loss for reflecting the estimated uncertainty to the\nclassification score.

In practice, CNN training on\nunpaired data is more preferred given the easiness of training data collection.\nIn this paper, we present a new Lightness-Guided Shadow Removal Network\n(LG-ShadowNet) for shadow removal by training on unpaired data. In this method,\nwe first train a CNN module to compensate for the lightness and then train a\nsecond CNN module with the guidance of lightness information from the first CNN\nmodule for final shadow removal.

While exceptionally successful, current methods\nassume the availability of training images in both source and target domains,\nwhich does not always hold in practice. Inspired by humans' reasoning\ncapability of analogy, we propose analogical image translation (AIT). Given\nimages of two styles in the source domain: $\\mathcal{A}$ and\n$\\mathcal{A}^\\prime$, along with images $\\mathcal{B}$ of the first style in the\ntarget domain, learn a model to translate $\\mathcal{B}$ to $\\mathcal{B}^\\prime$\nin the target domain, such that $\\mathcal{A}:\\mathcal{A}^\\prime\n::\\mathcal{B}:\\mathcal{B}^\\prime$. AIT is especially useful for translation\nscenarios in which training data of one style is hard to obtain but training\ndata of the same two styles in another domain is available. For instance, in\nthe case from normal conditions to extreme, rare conditions, obtaining real\ntraining images for the latter case is challenging but obtaining synthetic data\nfor both cases is relatively easy. In this work, we are interested in adding\nadverse weather effects, more specifically fog effects, to images taken in\nclear weather. To circumvent the challenge of collecting real foggy images, AIT\nlearns with synthetic clear-weather images, synthetic foggy images and real\nclear-weather images to add fog effects onto real clear-weather images without\nseeing any real foggy images during training. AIT achieves this zero-shot image\ntranslation capability by coupling a supervised training scheme in the\nsynthetic domain, a cycle consistency strategy in the real domain, an\nadversarial training scheme between the two domains, and a novel network\ndesign. Experiments show the effectiveness of our method for zero-short image\ntranslation and its benefit for downstream tasks such as semantic foggy scene\nunderstanding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Jun 2020 14:33:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-30"}

What types of masks exist, and how elaborate\nmust a mask be to be effective against COVID-19? 3. Does the mask have to be\napplied early in an epidemic? 4. A brief general discussion of masks and some\npossible future research questions regarding masks and SARS-CoV-2. Results are\nas follows: (1) The results indicate that any type of mask, even simple\nhome-made ones, may be effective. Masks use seems to have an effect in lowering\nnew patients even the protective effect of each mask (here dubbed \"one-mask\nprotection\") is low. Strict adherence to mask use does not appear to be\ncritical. However, increasing the one-mask protection to > 50% was found to be\nadvantageous. Masks seemed able to reduce overflow of capacity, e.g. of\nintensive care. As the default parameters of the software included another\nintervention, it seems possible to combine mask and other interventions. (2)\nMasks do seem to reduce the number of new cases even if introduced at a late\nstage in an epidemic. However, early implementation helps reduce the cumulative\nand total number of cases. (3) The simulations suggest that it might be\npossible to eliminate a COVID-19 outbreak by widespread mask use during a\nlimited period. The results from these simulations are encouraging, but do not\nnecessarily represent the real-life situation, so it is suggested that clinical\ntrials of masks are now carried out while continuously monitoring effects and\nside-effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Jun 2020 14:57:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-30"}

When the regression model\nis misspecified, estimation performance for the noisier domains can suffer due\nto substantial shrinkage towards a poorly estimated regression surface. In this\npaper, we introduce a new class of robust, empirically-driven regression\nweights that target estimation of the small domain means under potential\nmisspecification of the global regression model. Our regression weights are a\nconvex combination of the model-based weights associated with the best linear\nunbiased predictor (BLUP) and those associated with the observed best predictor\n(OBP). The compromise parameter in this convex combination is found by\nminimizing a novel, unbiased estimate of the mean-squared prediction error for\nthe small domain means, and we label the associated small domain estimates the\n\"compromise best predictor\", or CBP. Using a data-adaptive mixture for the\nregression weights enables the CBP to possess the robustness of the OBP while\nretaining the main advantages of the EBLUP whenever the regression model is\ncorrect.

Among all the energy storage technologies, battery systems may provide\nflexibility to the power grid in a more distributed and decentralized way. In\ncountries with deregulated electricity markets, grid-connected battery systems\nshould be operated under the specific market design of the country. In this\nwork, using the Spanish electricity market as an example, the barriers to\ngrid-connected battery systems are investigated using utilization analysis. The\nconcept of \"potentially profitable utilization time\" is proposed and introduced\nto identify and evaluate future potential grid applications for battery\nsystems. The numerical and empirical analysis suggests that the high cycle cost\nfor battery systems is still the main barrier for grid-connected battery\nsystems. In Spain, for energy arbitrage within the day-ahead market, it is\nrequired that the battery wear cost decreases to 15 Euro/MWh to make the\npotentially profitable utilization rate higher than 20%. Nevertheless, the\npotentially profitable utilization of batteries is much higher in the\napplications when higher flexibility is demanded. The minimum required battery\nwear cost corresponding to 20% potentially profitable utilization time\nincreases to 35 Euro/MWh for energy arbitrage within the day-ahead market and\nancillary services, and 50 Euro/MWh for upward secondary reserve. The results\nof this study contribute to the awareness of battery storage technology and its\nflexibility in grid applications. The findings also have significant\nimplications for policy makers and market operators interested in promoting\ngrid-connected battery storage under a deregulated power market.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Jun 2020 13:08:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Nov 2020 09:58:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-13"}

As the result the optimum\nclassification accuracy is not obtained. Also training times are large due to\nrunning the CNN training on single CPU/GPU. However it is known that using\nensembles of classifiers increases the performance. Also, the training times\ncan be reduced by running each member of the ensemble on a separate processor.\nEnsemble learning has been used in the past for traditional methods to a\nvarying extent and is a hot topic. With the advent of deep learning, ensemble\nlearning has been applied to the former as well. However, an area which is\nunexplored and has potential is One-Versus-All (OVA) deep ensemble learning. In\nthis paper we explore it and show that by using OVA ensembles of deep networks,\nimprovements in performance of deep networks can be obtained. As shown in this\npaper, the classification capability of deep networks can be further increased\nby using an ensemble of binary classification (OVA) deep networks.

In Spark, a task in a stage does not depend on any other tasks in the\nsame stage, and hence it can be scheduled independently. However, several\nalgorithms require more sophisticated inter-task communications, similar to the\nMPI paradigm. By combining distributed message passing (using asynchronous\nnetwork IO), OpenJDK's new auto-vectorization and Spark's barrier execution\nmode, we can add non-map/reduce based algorithms, such as Cannon's distributed\nmatrix multiplication to Spark. We document an efficient distributed matrix\nmultiplication using Cannon's algorithm, which improves significantly on the\nperformance of the existing MLlib implementation. Used within a barrier task,\nthe algorithm described herein results in an up to 24 percent performance\nincrease on a 10,000x10,000 square matrix with a significantly lower memory\nfootprint.

In many practical situations, the only available information\nis the flight search query performed by the customer with no additional profile\nknowledge. In general, customer flight bookings are driven by prices, duration,\nnumber of connections, and so on. However, not all customers might assign the\nsame importance to each of those criteria. Here comes the need of grouping\ntogether all flight searches performed by the same kind of customer, that is\nhaving the same booking criteria. The effectiveness of some set of\nrecommendations, for a single cluster, can be measured in terms of the number\nof bookings historically performed. This effectiveness measure plays the role\nof a feedback, that is an external knowledge which can be recombined to\niteratively obtain a final segmentation. In this paper, we describe our Online\nTravel Agencies (OTA) flight search use case and highlight its specific\nfeatures. We address the flight search segmentation problem motivated above by\nproposing a novel algorithm called Split-or-Merge (S/M). This algorithm is a\nvariation of the Split-Merge-Evolve (SME) method. The SME method has already\nbeen introduced in the community as an iterative process updating a clustering\ngiven by the K-means algorithm by splitting and merging clusters subject to\nfeedback independent evaluations. No previous application of the SME method to\nthe real-word data is reported in literature to the best of our knowledge.\nHere, we provide experimental evaluations over real-world data to the SME and\nthe S/M methods. The impact on our domain-specific metrics obtained under the\nSME and the S/M methods suggests that feedback clustering techniques can be\nvery promising in the handling of the domain of OTA flight searches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Jun 2020 11:19:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}

This causes two\ndifficulties in designing effective algorithms: first, the majority of users\nonly have a few interactions with the system and there is no enough data for\nlearning; second, there are no negative samples in the implicit feedbacks and\nit is a common practice to perform negative sampling to generate negative\nsamples. However, this leads to a consequence that many potential positive\nsamples are mislabeled as negative ones and data sparsity would exacerbate the\nmislabeling problem. To solve these difficulties, we regard the problem of\nrecommendation on sparse implicit feedbacks as a semi-supervised learning task,\nand explore domain adaption to solve it. We transfer the knowledge learned from\ndense data to sparse data and we focus on the most challenging case -- there is\nno user or item overlap. In this extreme case, aligning embeddings of two\ndatasets directly is rather sub-optimal since the two latent spaces encode very\ndifferent information. As such, we adopt domain-invariant textual features as\nthe anchor points to align the latent spaces. To align the embeddings, we\nextract the textual features for each user and item and feed them into a domain\nclassifier with the embeddings of users and items. The embeddings are trained\nto puzzle the classifier and textual features are fixed as anchor points. By\ndomain adaptation, the distribution pattern in the source domain is transferred\nto the target domain. As the target part can be supervised by domain\nadaptation, we abandon negative sampling in target dataset to avoid label\nnoise. We adopt three pairs of real-world datasets to validate the\neffectiveness of our transfer strategy. Results show that our models outperform\nexisting models significantly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Jun 2020 05:28:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}

However, predicting users' preference\non implicit feedback data is a challenging task since we can only observe\npositive (voted) samples and unvoted samples. It is difficult to distinguish\nbetween the negative samples and unlabeled positive samples from the unvoted\nones. Existing works, such as Bayesian Personalized Ranking (BPR), sample\nunvoted items as negative samples uniformly, therefore suffer from a critical\nnoisy-label issue. To address this gap, we design an adaptive sampler based on\nnoisy-label robust learning for implicit feedback data.\n  To formulate the issue, we first introduce Bayesian Point-wise Optimization\n(BPO) to learn a model, e.g., Matrix Factorization (MF), by maximum likelihood\nestimation. We predict users' preferences with the model and learn it by\nmaximizing likelihood of observed data labels, i.e., a user prefers her\npositive samples and has no interests in her unvoted samples. However, in\nreality, a user may have interests in some of her unvoted samples, which are\nindeed positive samples mislabeled as negative ones. We then consider the risk\nof these noisy labels, and propose a Noisy-label Robust BPO (NBPO). NBPO also\nmaximizes the observation likelihood while connects users' preference and\nobserved labels by the likelihood of label flipping based on the Bayes'\ntheorem. In NBPO, a user prefers her true positive samples and shows no\ninterests in her true negative samples, hence the optimization quality is\ndramatically improved. Extensive experiments on two public real-world datasets\nshow the significant improvement of our proposed optimization methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 28 Jun 2020 05:31:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}
