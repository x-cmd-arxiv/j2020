Its distinctive thermal history allows the\nmediator to be stable and therefore avoid strong limits from the cosmic\nmicrowave background and indirect detection. A natural by-product of this\nmechanism is a possibility of a late time, i.e., after recombination,\ntransition to subdominant dark radiation component through three-body and\none-loop decays to states containing the light mediator.

The analysis of real examples\nillustrate that the robust estimators provide better predictions for\nnon-outlying points than the classical ones, and that when potential outliers\nare removed from the training and test sets both methods behave very similarly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2020 16:19:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 2021 01:02:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 15 Jul 2021 18:05:22 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 25 Aug 2021 13:49:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-26"}

There are two main neural network structures:\nrecurrent neural network (RNN) and convolution neural network (CNN). RNN can\ncapture long term dependencies and store the semantics of the previous\ninformation in a fixed-sized vector. However, RNN is a biased model and its\nability to extract global semantics is restricted by the fixed-sized vector.\nAlternatively, CNN is able to capture n-gram features of texts by utilizing\nconvolutional filters. But the width of convolutional filters restricts its\nperformance. In order to combine the strengths of the two kinds of networks and\nalleviate their shortcomings, this paper proposes Attention-based Multichannel\nConvolutional Neural Network (AMCNN) for text classification. AMCNN utilizes a\nbi-directional long short-term memory to encode the history and future\ninformation of words into high dimensional representations, so that the\ninformation of both the front and back of the sentence can be fully expressed.\nThen the scalar attention and vectorial attention are applied to obtain\nmultichannel representations. The scalar attention can calculate the word-level\nimportance and the vectorial attention can calculate the feature-level\nimportance. In the classification task, AMCNN uses a CNN structure to cpture\nword relations on the representations generated by the scalar and vectorial\nattention mechanism instead of calculating the weighted sums. It can\neffectively extract the n-gram features of the text. The experimental results\non the benchmark datasets demonstrate that AMCNN achieves better performance\nthan state-of-the-art methods. In addition, the visualization results verify\nthe semantic richness of multichannel representations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2020 16:37:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-30"}

If a phase transition takes place during\nmerging, this results in a characteristic increase of the dominant postmerger\ngravitational-wave frequency relative to the tidal deformability characterizing\nthe inspiral phase. By comparing results from different purely hadronic and\nhybrid models we show that a strong phase transition can be identified from a\nsingle, simultaneous measurement of pre- and postmerger gravitational waves.\nFurthermore, we present new results for hybrid star mergers, which contain\nquark matter already during the inspiral stage.

This approach can be further extended to multiple replica exchange\nLangevin diffusion (mReLD), where $K$ additional LDs are added to sample\ndistributions at different temperatures and exchanges take place between\nneighboring-temperature processes. While ReLD and mReLD have been used\nextensively in statistical physics, molecular dynamics, and other applications,\nthere is little existing analysis on its convergence rate and choices of\ntemperatures. This paper closes these gaps assuming the target distribution is\na mixture of log-concave densities. We show ReLD can obtain constant or even\nbetter convergence rates even when the density components of the mixture\nconcentrate around isolated modes. We also show using mReLD with $K$ additional\nLDs can achieve the same result while the exchange frequency only needs to be\n$(1/K)$-th power of the one in ReLD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2020 17:01:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Jul 2020 19:36:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-14"}

Moreover, our method\nrequires only independence of serology test results, and does not rely on\nasymptotic arguments, normality assumptions, or other approximations. We use\nrecent Covid-19 serology studies in the US, and show that the parameter\nconfidence set is generally wide, and cannot support definite conclusions.\nSpecifically, recent serology studies from California suggest a prevalence\nanywhere in the range 0%-2% (at the time of study), and are therefore\ninconclusive.

We also prove analogous results for the Ricci tensor, as well as a\nlocalised version of Sesum's result, namely that the Ricci curvature must blow\nup near every singular point of a Ricci flow, again at least at a Type I rate.\nFinally, we show some applications of the theory to Ricci flows with bounded\nscalar curvature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2020 17:46:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Jul 2020 17:45:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 2022 20:15:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-13"}

In magnetars, disturbances of the field are strongly\ncoupled to the NS crust regardless of the triggering mechanism of short bursts.\nFor low-altitude magnetospheric magnetar models of fast radio bursts (FRBs)\nassociated with magnetar short bursts, such as the low-twist model, crustal\noscillations may be associated with additional radio bursts in the encompassing\nshort burst event (as recently suggested for SGR 1935+2154).

As a result, current\nreplacement policies typically resort to heuristics designed for specific\ncommon access patterns, which fail on more diverse and complex access patterns.\nIn contrast, we propose an imitation learning approach to automatically learn\ncache access patterns by leveraging Belady's, an oracle policy that computes\nthe optimal eviction decision given the future cache accesses.

We derive rigorous bounds on the error of a symmetry-protected\nsimulation algorithm and identify conditions for optimal symmetry protection.\nIn particular, when the symmetry transformations are chosen as powers of a\nunitary, the error of the algorithm is approximately projected to the so-called\nquantum Zeno subspaces. We prove a bound on this approximation error,\nexponentially improving a recent result of Burgarth, Facchi, Gramegna, and\nPascazio.

One possible PBH formation\nmechanism is the gravitational collapse of cosmic strings. Thus far, the\nentirety of the literature on PBH production from cosmic strings has focused on\nthe collapse of (quasi)circular cosmic string loops, which make up only a tiny\nfraction of the cosmic loop population. We demonstrate here a novel PBH\nformation mechanism: the collapse of a small segment of cosmic string in the\nneighbourhood of a cusp. Using the hoop conjecture, we show that collapse is\ninevitable whenever a cusp appears on a macroscopically-large loop, forming a\nPBH whose rest mass is smaller than the mass of the loop by a factor of the\ndimensionless string tension squared, $(G\\mu)^2$. Since cusps are generic\nfeatures of cosmic string loops, and do not rely on finely-tuned loop\nconfigurations like circular collapse, this implies that cosmic strings produce\nPBHs in far greater numbers than has previously been recognised. The resulting\nPBHs are highly spinning and boosted to ultrarelativistic velocities; they\npopulate a unique region of the BH mass-spin parameter space, and are therefore\na \"smoking gun\" observational signature of cosmic strings. We derive new\nconstraints on $G\\mu$ from the evaporation of cusp-collapse PBHs, and update\nexisting constraints on $G\\mu$ from gravitational-wave searches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2020 18:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Aug 2020 15:12:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-13"}

Both phenomena can be effectively described by a\nprojected, two-dimensional deflection potential whose gradient causes an\ninstantaneous light deflection in a single, thin lens plane. We highlight the\ndifferences in the time-delay and lensing equations that occur because plasma\nlensing is caused by a potential directly proportional to the deflecting\nelectron number density and gravitational lensing is caused by a potential\nrelated to the deflecting mass density by a Poisson equation. Since we treat\nplasma and gravitational lensing as thin-screen effective theories, their\ndegeneracies are both caused by the unknown distribution of deflecting objects.\nDeriving the formalism-intrinsic degeneracies for plasma lensing, we find that\nthey are analogous to those occurring in gravitational lensing. To break the\ndegeneracies, galaxies and galaxy-cluster scale strong gravitational lenses\nmust rely on additional assumptions or complementary observations. Physically\nrealistic assumptions to arrive at self-consistent lens and source\nreconstructions can be provided by simulations and analytical effective\ntheories. In plasma lensing, a deeper understanding of the deflecting electron\ndensity distributions is still under development, so that a model-based\ncomprehensive lens reconstruction is not yet possible. However, we show that\ntransient lenses and multi-wavelength observations help to break the arising\ndegeneracies. We conclude that the development of an observation-based\ninference of local lens properties seems currently the best way to further\nprobe the morphologies of plasma electron densities. Due to the simpler\nevidence-based breaking of the lensing degeneracies, we expect to obtain\ntighter constraints on the local plasma electron densities than on the\ngravitationally deflecting masses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2020 18:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

In the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) framework,\nit represents the leading term of an expansion in inverse powers of the hard\nscale. It contains the leading-twist TMD factorization formula relevant for\nsmall gluon's transverse momentum $k_t$, but also incorporates an all-order\nresummation of kinematical twists, resulting in a proper matching to\nhigh-energy factorization at large $k_t$. In this paper, we evaluate the\naccuracy of the ITMD formula quantitatively, for the case of quark dijet\nproduction in high-energy proton-proton($p+p$) and proton-nucleus ($p+A$)\ncollisions at LHC energies. We do so by comparing the quark-antiquark azimuthal\nangle $\\Delta\\phi$ distribution to that obtained with the CGC formula. For a\ndijet with each quark momentum $p_t$ much larger than the target saturation\nscale, $Q_s$, the ITMD formula is a good approximation to the CGC formula in a\nwide range of azimuthal angle. It becomes less accurate as the jet $p_t$'s are\nlowered, as expected, due to the presence of genuine higher-twists\ncontributions in the CGC framework, which represent multi-body scattering\neffects absent in the ITMD formula. We find that, as the hard jet momenta are\nlowered, the accuracy of ITMD start by deteriorating at small angles, in the\nhigh-energy-factorization regime, while in the TMD regime near\n$\\Delta\\phi=\\pi$, very low values of $p_t$ are needed to see differences\nbetween the CGC and the ITMD formula. In addition, the genuine twists\ncorrections to ITMD become visible for higher values of $p_t$ in $p+A$\ncollisions, compared to $p+p$ collisions, signaling that they are enhanced by\nthe target saturation scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2020 18:02:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 3 Jan 2021 16:34:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-05"}

Recently, we presented a selection of $\\sim 10^7$ halo\nstars with accurate distances that have been selected based on their photometry\nand proper motions. Using this sample, we model the tail of the velocity\ndistribution with a power-law distribution, a commonly used approach first\nestablished by \\cite{Leonard1990THESPEED}. For the first time ever we use\ntangential velocities measured accurately for an unprecedented number of halo\nstars to estimate the escape velocity.

As\na result, the true escape velocity most likely is closer to $550~{\\rm km/s}$.\nThe escape velocity directly constrains the total mass of the Milky Way. To\nfind the best fitting halo mass and concentration parameter we adjusted the\ndark (spherical NFW) halo of a realistic Milky Way potential while keeping the\ncircular velocity at the solar radius fixed at $v_c(R_\\odot) = 232.8~{\\rm\nkm/s}$.

An advantage of the accelerated-gradient\napproach is that it can be implemented using accelerated\ndelayed-self-reinforcement (A-DSR), which does not require new information from\nthe network nor modifications in the network connectivity. However, the\naccelerated-gradient approach is not directly applicable to general directed\ngraphs since the update law is not the gradient of the Laplacian-potential\nfunction. The main contribution of this work is to extend the\naccelerated-gradient approach to general directed graph networks, without\nrequiring the graph to be strongly connected. Additionally, while both the\nmomentum term and outdated-feedback term in the accelerated-gradient approach\nare important in general, it is shown that the momentum term alone is\nsufficient to achieve balanced robustness and rapid transitions without\noscillations in the dominant mode, for networks whose graph Laplacians have\nreal spectrum. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the performance\nimprovement with the proposed Robust A-DSR of 40% in structural robustness and\n50% in convergence rate to consensus, when compared to the case without the\nA-DSR. Moreover, experimental results are presented that show a similar 37%\nfaster convergence with the Robust A-DSR when compared to the case without the\nA-DSR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2020 18:11:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Nov 2020 23:03:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-10"}

In\nthis paper, seven years of IceCube data are compared to solar activity and\nsolar magnetic field models. A quantitative comparison of solar magnetic field\nmodels with IceCube data on the event rate level is performed for the first\ntime. Additionally, a first energy-dependent analysis is presented and compared\nto recent predictions. We use seven years of IceCube data for the Moon and the\nSun and compare them to simulations on data rate level. The simulations are\nperformed for the geometrical shadow hypothesis for the Moon and the Sun and\nfor a cosmic-ray propagation model governed by the solar magnetic field for the\ncase of the Sun. We find that a linearly decreasing relationship between Sun\nshadow strength and solar activity is preferred over a constant relationship at\nthe 6.4sigma level. We test two commonly used models of the coronal magnetic\nfield, both combined with a Parker spiral, by modeling cosmic-ray propagation\nin the solar magnetic field. Both models predict a weakening of the shadow in\ntimes of high solar activity as it is also visible in the data. We find\ntensions with the data on the order of $3\\sigma$ for both models, assuming only\nstatistical uncertainties. The magnetic field model CSSS fits the data slightly\nbetter than the PFSS model. This is generally consistent with what is found\npreviously by the Tibet AS-gamma Experiment, a deviation of the data from the\ntwo models is, however, not significant at this point. Regarding the energy\ndependence of the Sun shadow, we find indications that the shadowing effect\nincreases with energy during times of high solar activity, in agreement with\ntheoretical predictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2020 18:17:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-17"}

In contrast, spectra and\nimages of the cellular surface can be selectively obtained by tuning the\npulsing structure of the laser to restrict thermal wave penetration to the\nsurface layer. Resonant PTIR images reveal surface structures and domains that\nrange in size from about 20 nm to 1 um and are associated to the cytoplasmic\nmembrane and its proximity.

Furthermore,\ndynamic control strategies have been recently proposed to optimize wind farm\npower generation and longevity. Therefore, improved understanding of dynamic\nwake behaviors is essential. First, changes in blade pitch are investigated and\nthe wake expansion response is found to display hysteresis as a result of flow\ninertia. The timescales of the wake response to different pitch rates are\nquantified. Next, changes in wind direction with different timescales are\nexplored. Under short timescales, the wake deflection is in the opposite\ndirection of that observed under quasi-steady conditions. Finally, yaw changes\nare implemented at different rates, and the maximum inverse wake deflection and\ntimescale are quantified, showing a clear dependence on yaw rate. To gain\nfurther physical understanding of the mechanism behind the inverse wake\ndeflection, the streamwise vorticity in different parts of the wake is\nquantified. The results of this study provide guidance for the design of\nadvanced wake flow control algorithms. The lag in wake response observed for\nboth blade pitch and yaw changes shows that proposed dynamic control strategies\nmust implement turbine operational changes with a timescale on the order of the\nrotor timescale or slower.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2020 19:11:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Aug 2021 19:15:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-29"}

Our approach uses gradient information (based on\nIntegrated Gradients) to focus on a subset of neurons in the first layer, which\nallows our technique to scale to large networks. The corresponding SMT\nconstraints encode the minimal input mask discovery problem such that after\nmasking the input, the activations of the selected neurons are still above a\nthreshold. After solving for the minimal masks, our approach scores the mask\nregions to generate a relative ordering of the features within the mask. This\nproduces a saliency map which explains \"where a model is looking\" when making a\nprediction. We evaluate our technique on three datasets - MNIST, ImageNet, and\nBeer Reviews, and demonstrate both quantitatively and qualitatively that the\nregions generated by our approach are sparser and achieve higher saliency\nscores compared to the gradient-based methods alone.

Topological features describe the topology or\nstructure of a social network, and its underlying graph. We evaluated the\neffectiveness of these features by measuring the performance of different\nsupervised machine learning methods.

Our\nestimator is a minimizer of a penalized objective function, which aggregates\nthe data from the different experiments. We establish model selection\nconsistency and asymptotic normality of the estimator. In addition we present\nan information criterion, which can also be used for consistent model\nselection.

The\nalgorithm utilizes a set of spike-and-slab priors for the parameters in the\ndeep neural network. The hierarchical Bayesian mixture will be trained using an\nadaptive empirical method. That is, one will alternatively sample from the\nposterior using preconditioned stochastic gradient Langevin Dynamics (PSGLD),\nand optimize the latent variables via stochastic approximation. The sparsity of\nthe network is achieved while optimizing the hyperparameters with adaptive\nsearching and penalizing. A popular SG-MCMC approach is Stochastic gradient\nLangevin dynamics (SGLD). However, considering the complex geometry in the\nmodel parameter space in non-convex learning, updating parameters using a\nuniversal step size in each component as in SGLD may cause slow mixing. To\naddress this issue, we apply a computationally manageable preconditioner in the\nupdating rule, which provides a step-size parameter to adapt to local geometric\nproperties. Moreover, by smoothly optimizing the hyperparameter in the\npreconditioning matrix, our proposed algorithm ensures a decreasing bias, which\nis introduced by ignoring the correction term in preconditioned SGLD. According\nto the existing theoretical framework, we show that the proposed algorithm can\nasymptotically converge to the correct distribution with a controllable bias\nunder mild conditions. Numerical tests are performed on both synthetic\nregression problems and learning the solutions of elliptic PDE, which\ndemonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of present work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2020 20:57:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-17"}

Non-autoregressive (NAR) models have been recently proposed to reduce\nthe latency by generating all output tokens in parallel but could only achieve\ninferior accuracy compared to their autoregressive counterparts, primarily due\nto a difficulty in dealing with the multi-modality in sequence generation. This\npaper proposes a new approach that jointly optimizes both AR and NAR models in\na unified Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework. In the E-step, an AR model\nlearns to approximate the regularized posterior of the NAR model. In the\nM-step, the NAR model is updated on the new posterior and selects the training\nexamples for the next AR model. This iterative process can effectively guide\nthe system to remove the multi-modality in the output sequences. To our\nknowledge, this is the first EM approach to NAR sequence generation.

In\nthis paper we introduce an approach that shows that it is possible to provide\nexploitability guarantees in such settings without ever exploring the entire\ngame. We introduce a notion of a certificate of an extensive-form approximate\nNash equilibrium. For verifying a certificate, we give an algorithm that runs\nin time linear in the size of the certificate rather than the size of the whole\ngame. In zero-sum games, we further show that an optimal certificate -- given\nthe exploration so far -- can be computed with any standard game-solving\nalgorithm (e.g., using a linear program or counterfactual regret minimization).\nHowever, unlike in the cases of normal form or perfect information, we show\nthat certain families of extensive-form games do not have small approximate\ncertificates, even after making extremely nice assumptions on the structure of\nthe game. Despite this difficulty, we find experimentally that very small\ncertificates, even exact ones, often exist in large and even in infinite games.\nOverall, our approach enables one to try one's favorite exploration strategies\nwhile offering exploitability guarantees, thereby decoupling the exploration\nstrategy from the equilibrium-finding process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2020 21:11:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2020 04:32:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-17"}

In this paper we consider the IMP for\npolynomial ideals encoding combinatorial problems and where the input\npolynomial $f$ has degree at most $d=O(1)$ (we call this problem IMP$_d$). A\ndichotomy result between ``hard'' (NP-hard) and ``easy'' (polynomial time) IMPs\nwas recently achieved for Constraint Satisfaction Problems over finite domains\n[Bulatov FOCS'17, Zhuk FOCS'17] (this is equivalent to IMP$_0$) and IMP$_d$ for\nthe Boolean domain [Mastrolilli SODA'19], both based on the classification of\nthe IMP through functions called polymorphisms.

As a matter of fact the complexity of the IMP$_d$ for the\nternary minority polymorphism is open.

VAE is used as a dimension reduction technique to capture the\nlatent space, and KRnet is used to model the distribution of the latent\nvariable. Using a linear model between the data and the latent variable, we\nshow that VAE-KRnet can be more effective and robust than the canonical VAE.\nVAE-KRnet can be used as a density model to approximate either data\ndistribution or an arbitrary probability density function (PDF) known up to a\nconstant. VAE-KRnet is flexible in terms of dimensionality. When the number of\ndimensions is relatively small, KRnet can effectively approximate the\ndistribution in terms of the original random variable. For high-dimensional\ncases, we may use VAE-KRnet to incorporate dimension reduction. One important\napplication of VAE-KRnet is the variational Bayes for the approximation of the\nposterior distribution.

These\nnetworks are widely identified by their unique characteristics such as lack of\ninfrastructure, mobility and multi-hop communication. Unlike traditional\n(wired) networks, MNs in MANETs do not rely on any infrastructure or central\nmanagement. Mobility allows MNs to move at different values of speed. Multi-hop\ncommunication is used to deliver data across the entire network. Due to\nmobility and changing network topology, the performance of these networks is\nsignificantly affected by the choice of mobility models and routing protocols.\nOur research work aims to evaluate the effects of mobility metrics on\ndistinguishing between entity and group mobility models in MANETs.

The first technique (Lift)\nextends the set of variables in the optimization problem to products of those\nvariables, arranged as a moment matrix. This algebraic idea is a celebrated way\nto replace a hard polynomial optimization problem by a semidefinite programming\napproximation. Concretely, both the model and the wavefield are lifted from\nvectors to rank-2 matrices. The second technique (Relax) invites to consider\nthe wave equation, not as a hard constraint, but as a soft constraint to be\nsatisfied only approximately - a technique known as wavefield reconstruction\ninversion (WRI). WRI weakens wave-equation constraints by introducing\nwave-equation misfits as a weighted penalty term in the objective function. The\nrelaxed penalty formulation enables balancing the data and wave-equation\nmisfits by tuning a penalty parameter. Together, Lift and Relax help\nreformulate the inverse problem as a set of constraints on a rank-2 moment\nmatrix in a higher dimensional space. Such a lifting strategy permits a good\ndata and wave-equation fit throughout the inversion process, while leaving the\nnumerical rank of the rank-2 moment matrix to be minimized down to one.\nNumerical examples indicate that compared to FWI and WRI, LRWI can conduct\nsuccessful inversions using an initial model that would be considered too poor,\nand data with a starting frequency that would be considered too high, for\neither method in isolation.

In this field, many popular\napproaches are influenced by the skip-gram model from natural language\nprocessing. Most of them use a contrastive objective to train an encoder which\nforces the embeddings of similar pairs to be close and embeddings of negative\nsamples to be far. A key of success to such contrastive learning methods is how\nto draw positive and negative samples. While negative samples that are\ngenerated by straightforward random sampling are often satisfying, methods for\ndrawing positive examples remains a hot topic.\n  In this paper, we propose SCE for unsupervised network embedding only using\nnegative samples for training. Our method is based on a new contrastive\nobjective inspired by the well-known sparsest cut problem. To solve the\nunderlying optimization problem, we introduce a Laplacian smoothing trick,\nwhich uses graph convolutional operators as low-pass filters for smoothing node\nrepresentations. The resulting model consists of a GCN-type structure as the\nencoder and a simple loss function. Notably, our model does not use positive\nsamples but only negative samples for training, which not only makes the\nimplementation and tuning much easier, but also reduces the training time\nsignificantly.\n  Finally, extensive experimental studies on real world data sets are\nconducted. The results clearly demonstrate the advantages of our new model in\nboth accuracy and scalability compared to strong baselines such as GraphSAGE,\nG2G and DGI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2020 03:18:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2020 16:06:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 17 Jul 2020 15:59:14 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 10 Dec 2020 04:02:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-11"}

Recognizing objects from a point\ncloud is often required for industrial 3D reconstruction, which should include\nnot only geometry information but also semantic information. However,\nrecognition process is often a bottleneck in 3D reconstruction because it\nrequires expertise on domain knowledge and intensive labor. To address this\nproblem, various methods have been developed to recognize objects by retrieving\nthe corresponding model in the database from an input geometry query. In recent\nyears, the technique of converting geometric data into an image and applying\nview-based 3D shape retrieval has demonstrated high accuracy. Depth image which\nencodes depth value as intensity of pixel is frequently used for view-based 3D\nshape retrieval. However, geometric data collected from objects is often\nincomplete due to the occlusions and the limit of line of sight.

In particular, optimal antenna placement in UCAs and\ntransceiver architectures to achieve the maximum channel capacity without the\nknowledge of misalignment components are presented. To this end, we first\nderive a generic channel model of UCA-based LoS MIMO systems in which three\nmisalignment factors including relative array rotation, tilting and\ncenter-shift are reflected concurrently. By factorizing the channel matrix into\nthe singular value decomposition (SVD) form, we demonstrate that the singular\nvalues of UCA-based LoS MIMO systems are \\textit{independent} of tilting and\ncenter-shift. Rather, they can be expressed as a function of the \\textit{radii\nproduct-to-distance ratio} (RPDR) and the angle of relative array rotation.\nNumerical analyses of singular values show that the RPDR is a key design\nparameter of UCA systems. Based on this result, we propose an optimal design\nmethod for UCA systems which performs a one-dimensional search of RPDR to\nmaximize channel capacity. It is observed that the channel matrix of the\noptimally designed UCA system is close to an orthogonal matrix; this fact\nallows channel capacity to be achieved by a simple zero-forcing (ZF) receiver.\nAdditionally, we propose a low-complexity precoding scheme for UCA systems in\nwhich the optimal design criteria cannot be fulfilled because of limits on\narray size. The simulation results demonstrate the validity of the proposed\ndesign method and transceiver architectures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2020 03:48:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

In this paper, we propose the\nhierarchical graph matching network (HGMN), which learns to compute graph\nsimilarity from data. HGMN is motivated by the observation that two similar\ngraphs should also be similar when they are compressed into more compact\ngraphs. HGMN utilizes multiple stages of hierarchical clustering to organize a\ngraph into successively more compact graphs. At each stage, the earth mover\ndistance (EMD) is adopted to obtain a one-to-one mapping between the nodes in\ntwo graphs (on which graph similarity is to be computed), and a correlation\nmatrix is also derived from the embeddings of the nodes in the two graphs. The\ncorrelation matrices from all stages are used as input for a convolutional\nneural network (CNN), which is trained to predict graph similarity by\nminimizing the mean squared error (MSE). Experimental evaluation on 4 datasets\nin different domains and 4 performance metrics shows that HGMN consistently\noutperforms existing baselines in the accuracy of graph similarity\napproximation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2020 06:16:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

A primary security concern of\nLPWAN technology is the attacks that block legitimate communication between\nnodes resulting in scenarios like loss of packets, delayed packet arrival, and\nskewed packet reaching the reporting gateway. LoRa (Long Range) is a promising\nwireless radio access technology that supports long-range communication at low\ndata rates and low power consumption. LoRa is considered as one of the ideal\ncandidates for building LPWANs. We use LoRa as a reference technology to review\nthe IoT security threats on the air and the applicability of different\ncountermeasures that have been adopted so far. LoRa nodes that are close to the\ngateway use a small SF than the nodes which are far away. But it also implies\nlong in-the-air transmission time, which makes the transmitted packets\nvulnerable to different kinds of malicious attacks, especially in the physical\nand the link layer. Therefore, it is not possible to enforce a fixed set of\nrules for all LoRa nodes since they have different levels of vulnerabilities.\nOur survey reveals that there is an urgent need for secure and uninterrupted\ncommunication between an end-device and the gateway, especially when the threat\nmodels are unknown in advance. We explore the traditional countermeasures and\nfind that most of them are ineffective now, such as frequency hopping and\nspread spectrum methods. In order to adapt to new threats, the emerging\ncountermeasures using game-theoretic approaches and reinforcement machine\nlearning methods can effectively identify threats and dynamically choose the\ncorresponding actions to resist threats, thereby making secured and reliable\ncommunications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2020 06:30:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

While if\ngradually doping some hydrogen atoms into WO3 layer by a facile electron-proton\nsynergistic route, the heterojunction can be turned dynamically from the\ntypical p-n junction (n-WO3/p-GaN) to standard Schottky contact (HxWO3/p-GaN)\nstep by step. More importantly, this evolution can be directly visualized by\neyesight due to the pronounced electrochromic characteristic of WO3 layer. By\nconnecting two HxWO3/p-GaN heterojunctions, the controllable bi-functional\nrectification can be achieved. In addition, the HxWO3/p-GaN heterojunction can\nrecovered to the original p-n jucntion just by annealing at ambient,\ndemonstrating the heterojunction is controllable and reusable. The current\nstudy will open up tremendous opportunities for dynamic electronic devices in\nthe future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2020 07:06:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

Typically, robot\nbehavior is governed by algorithms that optimize a reward function that should\nquantitatively capture the joint system's goal. Although reward functions can\nbe updated to better match human needs, this is no guarantee that no\nmisalignment with the complex and variable human needs will occur. Algorithms\nmay learn undesirable behavior when interacting with the human and the\nintrinsically unpredictable human-inhabited world, thereby producing further\nmisalignment with human users or bystanders. As a result, humans might behave\ndifferently than anticipated, causing robots to learn differently and\nundesirable behavior to emerge. With this short paper, we state that to design\nfor Human-Robot Interaction that mitigates such undesirable emergent behavior,\nwe need to complement advancements in human-robot interaction algorithms with\nhuman factors knowledge and expertise. More specifically, we advocate a\nthree-pronged approach that we illustrate using a particularly challenging\nexample of safety-critical human-robot interaction: a driver interacting with a\nsemi-automated vehicle. Undesirable emergent behavior should be mitigated by a\ncombination of 1) including driver behavioral mechanisms in the vehicle's\nalgorithms and reward functions, 2) model-based approaches that account for\ninteraction-induced driver behavioral adaptations and 3) driver-centered\ninteraction design that promotes driver engagement with the semi-automated\nvehicle, and the transparent communication of each agent's actions that allows\nmutual support and adaptation.

Using two different reflectometric methods, we investigate the\nspontaneous growth of H-bonded PPO-PMAA membranes at a flat liquid-liquid\ninterface. We find that the membrane thickness h grows with time t as\nh~t^(1/2), which is reminiscent of a diffusion-limited process.

We are able to rationalize these results with a model which\nconsiders the diffusion of the PPO chains within the growing membrane. The\narchitecture of the latter is described as a gel-like porous network, with a\npore size much smaller than the radius of the diffusing PPO chains, thus\ninducing entropic barriers that hinder the diffusion process.

We find that in most of the cases, non-residual student networks\nperform equally or better than their residual versions trained on raw data\nwithout KD (baseline network). Surprisingly, in some cases, they surpass the\naccuracy of baseline networks even with the inferior teachers. After a certain\ndepth of non-residual student network, the accuracy drop, coming from the\nremoval of residual connections, is substantial, and training with KD boosts\nthe accuracy of the student up to a great extent; however, it does not fully\nrecover the accuracy drop.

Alternatively, starting from the divergent behavior of the\nperturbative QCD encoded in the singularities in the Borel plane, a modified\nexpansion can be defined by means of the conformal mapping of this plane. A\ncomparison of the two approaches concerning their ability to recover\nnonperturbative properties of the true correlator was not explored up to now.\nIn the present paper, we make a first attempt to investigate this problem. We\nuse for illustration the Adler function and observables expressed as integrals\nof this function along contours in the complex energy plane. We show that the\nexpansions based on the conformal mapping of the Borel plane go beyond\nfinite-order perturbation theory, containing an infinite number of terms when\nreexpanded in powers of the coupling. Moreover, the expansion functions exhibit\nnonperturbative features of the true function, while the expansions have a\ntamed behavior at large orders and are expected even to be convergent. Using\nthese properties, we argue that there are no mathematical reasons for\nsupplementing the expansions based on the conformal mapping of the Borel plane\nby additional arbitrary power corrections. Therefore, we make the conjecture\nthat they provide an alternative to the standard OPE in approximating the QCD\ncorrelator.

This\ndecomposition has the principle benefit of reducing computational time for\ndynamic simulation of the system. In this context, DS methods may form an\nessential component of hybrid simulation, wherein they can be used to couple\nphysical and numerical substructures at reduced computational cost. Since most\nengineered systems are inherently nonlinear, particular potential lies in\nincorporating nonlinear methods in existing substructuring schemes which are\nlargely linear methods.\n  The most widely used and studied DS methods are classical linear techniques\nsuch as the Craig-Bampton (CB) method.

Recent advancements in\nsubstructuring have involved the development of enrichments to linear methods,\nwhich allow for some degree of nonlinearity to be captured.

Deterministic switching is achieved without external\nmagnetic fields at room temperature, and the switching occurs with currents one\norder of magnitude smaller than those typical in devices using the\nbest-performing heavy metals. The thickness dependence can be understood if the\ninterfacial spin-orbit contribution is considered in addition to the bulk spin\nHall effect.

In total, 35 sub-datasets are provided with 6D pose ground\ntruth for the ex-vivo part: 18 sub-dataset for colon, 12 sub-datasets for\nstomach and 5 sub-datasets for small intestine, while four of these contain\npolyp-mimicking elevations carried out by an expert gastroenterologist.\nSynthetic capsule endoscopy frames from GI-tract with both depth and pose\nannotations are included to facilitate the study of simulation-to-real transfer\nlearning algorithms. Additionally, we propound Endo-SfMLearner, an unsupervised\nmonocular depth and pose estimation method that combines residual networks with\nspatial attention module in order to dictate the network to focus on\ndistinguishable and highly textured tissue regions. The proposed approach makes\nuse of a brightness-aware photometric loss to improve the robustness under fast\nframe-to-frame illumination changes. To exemplify the use-case of the EndoSLAM\ndataset, the performance of Endo-SfMLearner is extensively compared with the\nstate-of-the-art.

Consequently, the restoration is limited to\nusing the same-scale information while neglecting potential high-resolution\n(HR) cues from other scales. In this paper, we explore the cross-scale patch\nrecurrence property of a natural image, i.e., similar patches tend to recur\nmany times across different scales. This is achieved using a novel cross-scale\ninternal graph neural network (IGNN). Specifically, we dynamically construct a\ncross-scale graph by searching k-nearest neighboring patches in the downsampled\nLR image for each query patch in the LR image. We then obtain the corresponding\nk HR neighboring patches in the LR image and aggregate them adaptively in\naccordance to the edge label of the constructed graph. In this way, the HR\ninformation can be passed from k HR neighboring patches to the LR query patch\nto help it recover more detailed textures.

These limits lie $1.5-2$ orders of magnitude above\nthe thermal relic cross section value, depending on the considered branon mass.\nYet, CTA will allow to exclude a significant portion of the brane tension-mass\nparameter space in the $0.1-60$ TeV branon mass range, and up to tensions of\n$\\sim 10$ TeV. More importantly, CTA will significantly enlarge the region\nalready excluded by AMS and CMS, and will provide valuable complementary\ninformation to future SKA radio observations. We conclude that CTA will possess\npotential to constrain brane-world models and, more in general, TeV DM\ncandidates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2020 12:00:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Oct 2020 17:51:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-27"}

This work introduces deleted-key\ncovenants; using pre-signed transactions with secure key deletion. With this, a\ngeneral class of covenants are possible without introducing new security risks\nto bitcoin. There is a range of security models for the key deletion process,\nbut this is subject to a security-convenience trade-off and requires\ninteractivity in a multi-party context. On the other hand, this work makes a\ncompelling case for what can be gained through a soft-fork upgrade to the\nsignature hash system [Dec17] which enables recovered-key covenants through\nelliptic curve key recovery. This has similar properties to script-based\ncovenant mechanisms proposed previously [Rub20]. Key factors are discussed and\ncompared for the three covenant mechanisms, including; the enforcement process,\nmethods for proving accessibility of funds and whether or not they are bound by\na covenant, methods for dynamic fee allocation, the underlying cryptographic\nassumptions, and their feasibility in single-party, hierarchical and\nadversarial multi-party contexts. Despite the relative downsides of deleted-key\ncovenants, they are a practical tool for custody protocol design. The\ncomparison shows precisely how soft-fork proposals improve the practicality of\nbitcoin covenants, through non-interactive enforcement and tighter\ncryptographic assumptions, to enhance custody protocols and enable some\nadversarial applications such as payment protocols.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2020 12:12:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

Many distributed\nframeworks have been proposed for different machine learning tasks. In this\npaper, we study the distributed kernel regression via the divide and conquer\napproach. This approach has been proved asymptotically minimax optimal if the\nkernel is perfectly selected so that the true regression function lies in the\nassociated reproducing kernel Hilbert space. However, this is usually, if not\nalways, impractical because kernels that can only be selected via prior\nknowledge or a tuning process are hardly perfect. Instead it is more common\nthat the kernel is good enough but imperfect in the sense that the true\nregression can be well approximated by but does not lie exactly in the kernel\nspace. We show distributed kernel regression can still achieves capacity\nindependent optimal rate in this case. To this end, we first establish a\ngeneral framework that allows to analyze distributed regression with response\nweighted base algorithms by bounding the error of such algorithms on a single\ndata set, provided that the error bounds has factored the impact of the\nunexplained variance of the response variable. Then we perform a leave one out\nanalysis of the kernel ridge regression and bias corrected kernel ridge\nregression, which in combination with the aforementioned framework allows us to\nderive sharp error bounds and capacity independent optimal rates for the\nassociated distributed kernel regression algorithms. As a byproduct of the\nthorough analysis, we also prove the kernel ridge regression can achieve rates\nfaster than $N^{-1}$ (where $N$ is the sample size) in the noise free setting\nwhich, to our best knowledge, are first observed and novel in regression\nlearning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2020 13:00:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

Here we\nbridge this gap by considering the probability of diffusive trajectories to\nremain within a tube of small but finite radius around a smooth path. This\nprobability can be measured in experiment, via the rate at which trajectories\nexit the tube for the first time, thereby establishing a link between path\nprobabilities and physical observables.

EoR models rely on cosmic microwave background (CMB)\nobservations, and in particular the large-scale E-mode polarization power\nspectra (EE PS), to help constrain their highly uncertain parameters. However,\nrather than directly forward-modelling the EE PS, most EoR models are\nconstrained using a summary statistic -- the Thompson scattering optical depth,\n$\\tau_e$. Compressing CMB observations to $\\tau_e$ requires adopting a basis\nset for the EoR history. The common choice is the unphysical,\nredshift-symmetric hyperbolic tangent (Tanh) function, which differs in shape\nfrom physical EoR models based on hierarchical structure formation. Combining\npublic EoR and CMB codes, 21cmFAST and CLASS, here we quantify how inference\nusing the $\\tau_e$ summary statistic impacts the resulting constraints on\ngalaxy properties and EoR histories. Using the last Planck 2018 data release,\nwe show that the marginalized constraints on the EoR history are more sensitive\nto the choice of the basis set (Tanh vs physical model) than to the CMB\nlikelihood statistic ($\\tau_e$ vs PS).

Often, the\nenergy of the HEG is parameterized as a function of its spin density $n$,\nleading to the local density approximation (LDA) for inhomogeneous systems.\nHowever, the connection between the electron density and kinetic energy density\nof the HEG can be used to generalize the LDA by evaluating it on a weighted\ngeometric average of the local spin density and the spin density of a HEG that\nhas the local kinetic energy density of the inhomogeneous system, with a mixing\nratio $x$. This leads to a new family of functionals that we term meta-local\ndensity approximations (meta-LDAs), which are still exact for the HEG, which\nare derived only from properties of the HEG, and which form a new rung of\nJacob's ladder of density functionals. The first functional of this ladder, the\nlocal $\\tau$ approximation (LTA) of Ernzerhof and Scuseria that corresponds to\n$x=1$ is unfortunately not stable enough to be used in self-consistent field\ncalculations, because it leads to divergent potentials as we show in this work.\nHowever, a geometric averaging of the LDA and LTA densities with smaller values\nof $x$ not only leads to numerical stability of the resulting functional, but\nalso yields more accurate exchange energies in atomic calculations than the\nLDA, the LTA, or the tLDA functional ($x=1/4$) of Eich and Hellgren. We choose\n$x=0.50$ as it gives the best total energy in self-consistent exchange-only\ncalculations for the argon atom. Atomization energy benchmarks confirm that the\nchoice $x=0.50$ also yields improved energetics in combination with correlation\nfunctionals in molecules, almost eliminating the well-known overbinding of the\nLDA and reducing its error by two thirds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2020 14:21:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Oct 2020 13:43:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 10 Dec 2020 23:27:20 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 2021 15:15:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-10"}

In the frequency domain, one solves a discretized\nHelmholtz equation, while in the time domain, the periodic solutions to a\ndiscretized wave equation are sought, e.g. by simulating for a long time with a\ntime-harmonic forcing term. Disadvantages of the time-domain method are that\nthe solutions are affected by temporal discretization errors and that the\nspatial discretization cannot be freely chosen, since it is inherited from the\ntime-domain scheme. In this work we address these issues. Given an indefinite\nlinear system satisfying certain properties, a matrix recurrence relation is\nconstructed, such that in the limit the exact discrete solution is obtained. By\niterating a large, finite number of times, an approximate solution is obtained,\nsimilarly as in a time-domain method for the Helmholtz equation.

Typically, the junctions for qubits are\nfabricated using shadow evaporation techniques to reduce dielectric loss\ncontributions from the superconducting film interfaces. In recent years,\nhowever, sub-micron scale overlap junctions have started to attract attention.\nCompared to shadow mask techniques, neither an angle dependent deposition nor\nfree-standing bridges or overlaps are needed, which are significant limitations\nfor wafer-scale processing. This comes at the cost of breaking the vacuum\nduring fabrication, but simplifies integration in multi-layered circuits,\nimplementation of vastly different junction sizes, and enables fabrication on a\nlarger scale in an industrially-standardized process. In this work, we\ndemonstrate the feasibility of a subtractive process for fabrication of overlap\njunctions. In an array of test contacts, we find low aging of the average\nnormal state resistance of only 1.6\\% over 6 months. We evaluate the coherence\nproperties of the junctions by employing them in superconducting transmon\nqubits. In time domain experiments, we find that both, the qubit life- and\ncoherence time of our best device, are on average greater than\n$20\\,\\si{\\micro\\second}$.

The approach is motivated by fundamental changes in the operation\nof power grids, in particular by the substitution of conventional power plants\nwith new renewable sources of electrical energy. This substitution will\nsimultaneously increase fluctuations in power generation and reduce the\navailable mechanical inertia. It is crucial to understand how strongly these\ntwo evolutions will impact grid stability. With very few, mostly numerical\nexceptions, earlier works on performance metrics had to rely on unrealistic\nassumptions of grid homogeneity. Here we show that a modified spectral\ndecomposition can tackle that issue in inhomogeneous power grids in cases where\ndisturbances occur on time scales that are long compared to the intrinsic time\nscales of the grid. We find in particular that the magnitude of the transient\nexcursion generated by disturbances with long characteristic times does not\ndepend on inertia. For continental-size, high-voltage power grids, this\ncorresponds to power fluctuations that are correlated on time scales of few\nseconds or more. We conclude that power fluctuations arising from new\nrenewables will not require per se the deployment of additional rotational\ninertia.

However, direct\nnonparametric estimation for high-dimensional joint probability is in general\nimpossible, due to the curse of dimensionality. Recent work has proposed to\nrecover the joint probability mass function (PMF) of an arbitrary number of RVs\nfrom three-dimensional marginals, leveraging the algebraic properties of\nlow-rank tensor decomposition and the (unknown) dependence among the RVs.\nNonetheless, accurately estimating three-dimensional marginals can still be\ncostly in terms of sample complexity, affecting the performance of this line of\nwork in practice in the sample-starved regime. Using three-dimensional\nmarginals also involves challenging tensor decomposition problems whose\ntractability is unclear. This work puts forth a new framework for learning the\njoint PMF using only pairwise marginals, which naturally enjoys a lower sample\ncomplexity relative to the third-order ones. A coupled nonnegative matrix\nfactorization (CNMF) framework is developed, and its joint PMF recovery\nguarantees under various conditions are analyzed. Our method also features a\nGram--Schmidt (GS)-like algorithm that exhibits competitive runtime\nperformance. The algorithm is shown to provably recover the joint PMF up to\nbounded error in finite iterations, under reasonable conditions.

Currently, most infill structure generation\nmethods are based on the conventional 2.5-axis printing configuration, which,\nalthough able to satisfy the self-supporting condition on the infills, suffer\nfrom the well-known stair-case effect on the finished surface and the need of\nextensive support for overhang features.

The algorithm critically relies on the use of\nthree mutually orthogonal geodesic distance fields that are embedded in the\ntetrahedral mesh of the solid model. The intersection between the iso-geodesic\ndistance surfaces of these three geodesic distance fields naturally forms the\ndesired lattice of infill structure, while the density of the infills can be\nconveniently controlled by adjusting the iso-values. The lattice infill pattern\nin each curved slicing layer is trimmed to conform to an Eulerian graph so to\ngenerate a continuous printing path, which can effectively reduce the nozzle\nretractions during the printing process. In addition, to cater to the\ncollision-free requirement and to improve the printing efficiency, we also\npropose a printing sequence optimization algorithm for determining a\ncollision-free order of printing of the connected lattice infills, which seeks\nto reduce the air-move length of the nozzle.

Moreover, as the\nparameter $\\varepsilon$ goes to $0^+$, the images\n$\\mathbf{f}_{\\varepsilon}(\\mathbb{S}^{d-1})$ converge, as sets, to the boundary\n$B$ of the convex hull. We prove this theorem using techniques from convex\ngeometry of (spherical) polytopes and set-valued homology.

The purpose of this paper is to improve the accuracy of forecasting\nimplied volatility using an extension of genetic programming (GP) by means of\ndynamic training-subset selection methods. These methods manipulate the\ntraining data in order to improve the out of sample patterns fitting. When\napplied with the static subset selection method using a single training data\nsample, GP could generate forecasting models which are not adapted to some out\nof sample fitness cases. In order to improve the predictive accuracy of\ngenerated GP patterns, dynamic subset selection methods are introduced to the\nGP algorithm allowing a regular change of the training sample during evolution.\nFour dynamic training-subset selection methods are proposed based on random,\nsequential or adaptive subset selection. The latest approach uses an adaptive\nsubset weight measuring the sample difficulty according to the fitness cases\nerrors. Using real data from SP500 index options, these techniques are compared\nto the static subset selection method. Based on MSE total and percentage of non\nfitted observations, results show that the dynamic approach improves the\nforecasting performance of the generated GP models, specially those obtained\nfrom the adaptive random training subset selection method applied to the whole\nset of training samples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2020 21:28:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}

BERTERS converts text into a\nvector using the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer (BERT).\nAlso, a graph Representation technique called ExEm is used to extract the\nfeatures of candidates from the co-author network. Final representation of a\ncandidate is the concatenation of these vectors and other features. Eventually,\na classifier is built on the concatenation of features.

The normal component of the pulse breaks the inversion symmetry of\nthe system and opens up a dynamical band-gap, due to which a valley-selective\npopulation of the conduction band becomes sensitive to the angle of incident of\nthe pulse. We show that the magnitude of the valley polarization can be\ncontrolled by the angle of incidence, the amplitude, and the angle of in-plane\npolarization of the chiral optical pulse. Subsequently, a sequence of a\ncircularly polarized pulse followed by a linearly polarized femtosecond-long\npulse can be used to control the valley polarization created by the preceding\npulse. Generally, the linearly polarized pulse depolarizes the system. The\nmagnitude of such a depolarization depends on the amplitude, and the in-plane\npolarization angle of the linearly polarized pulse.

However, the\nweak light-matter interaction in traditional active Silicon optoelectronics\nmandates rather sizable device lengths. The ideal active material choice should\navail high index modulation while being easily integrated into Silicon\nphotonics platforms. Indium tin oxide (ITO) offers such functionalities and has\nshown promising modulation capacity recently. Interestingly, the nanometer-thin\nunity-strong index modulation of ITO synergistically combines the high\ngroup-index in hybrid plasmonic with nanoscale optical modes. Following this\ndesign paradigm, here, we demonstrate a spectrally broadband, GHz-fast\nMach-Zehnder interferometric modulator, exhibiting a high efficiency signified\nby a miniscule VpL of 95 Vum, deploying an one-micrometer compact\nelectrostatically tunable plasmonic phase-shifter, based on heterogeneously\nintegrated ITO thin films into silicon photonics. Furthermore we show, that\nthis device paradigm enables spectrally broadband operation across the entire\ntelecommunication near infrared C-band. Such sub-wavelength short efficient and\nfast modulators monolithically integrated into Silicon platform open up new\npossibilities for high-density photonic circuitry, which is critical for high\ninterconnect density of photonic neural networks or applications in GHz-fast\noptical phased-arrays, for example.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2020 14:22:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2020 23:07:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-25"}

This paper deals with the\nfirst step of this approach which consists in developing a three-dimensional\nhydrodynamic simulation coupled with water quality parameters.

Agoda aggregates non-direct suppliers' hotel\nrooms to ensure that Agoda's customers always have the widest selection of\nhotels, room types and packages. As of today, Agoda aggregates millions of\nhotels. The major challenge is that each supplier only allows Agoda to fetch\nfor the hotel price with a limited amount of Queries Per Second (QPS). Due to\nthe sheer volume of Agoda's user search traffic, this limited amount of QPS is\nnever enough to cover all user searches. Inevitably, many user searches have to\nbe ignored. Hence, booking lost. To overcome the challenge, we built\nPriceAggregator. PriceAggregator intelligently determines when, how and what to\nsend to the suppliers to fetch for price. In this paper, we not only prove\nPriceAggregator is optimal theoretically but also demonstrate that\nPriceAggregator performs well in practice. PriceAggregator has been deployed in\nAgoda.
