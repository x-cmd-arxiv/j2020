Gaussian noise. It is now understood\nthat the optimal regret on time horizon $T$ against the optimal control law\nscales as $\\widetilde{\\Theta}(\\sqrt{T})$. In this paper, we show that the same\nregret rate (against a suitable benchmark) is attainable even in the\nconsiderably more general non-stochastic control model, where the system is\ndriven by \\emph{arbitrary adversarial} noise (Agarwal et al. 2019). In other\nwords, \\emph{stochasticity confers little benefit in online LQR}.\n  We attain the optimal $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{T})$ regret when the\ndynamics are unknown to the learner, and $\\mathrm{poly}(\\log T)$ regret when\nknown, provided that the cost functions are strongly convex (as in LQR). Our\nalgorithm is based on a novel variant of online Newton step (Hazan et al.\n2007), which adapts to the geometry induced by possibly adversarial\ndisturbances, and our analysis hinges on generic \"policy regret\" bounds for\ncertain structured losses in the OCO-with-memory framework (Anava et al. 2015).\nMoreover, our results accomodate the full generality of the non-stochastic\ncontrol setting: adversarially chosen (possibly non-quadratic) costs, partial\nstate observation, and fully adversarial process and observation noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jun 2020 16:00:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 2020 03:03:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-06"}

However,\nthese successes are mostly achieved by 'black-box' policies in simulated\ndomains. When deploying RL to the real world, several concerns regarding the\nuse of a 'black-box' policy might be raised. In order to make the learned\npolicies more transparent, we propose in this paper a policy iteration scheme\nthat retains a complex function approximator for its internal value predictions\nbut constrains the policy to have a concise, hierarchical, and human-readable\nstructure, based on a mixture of interpretable experts. Each expert selects a\nprimitive action according to a distance to a prototypical state. A key design\ndecision to keep such experts interpretable is to select the prototypical\nstates from trajectory data. The main technical contribution of the paper is to\naddress the challenges introduced by this non-differentiable prototypical state\nselection procedure.

Differences in retrieved radiances\nlead to significant drops in accuracy, which hampers knowledge and information\nsharing across sensors. This is particularly harmful for machine learning\nalgorithms, since gathering new ground truth data to train models for each\nsensor is costly and requires experienced manpower. In this work, we propose a\ndomain adaptation transformation to reduce the statistical differences between\nimages of two satellite sensors in order to boost the performance of transfer\nlearning models. The proposed methodology is based on the Cycle Consistent\nGenerative Adversarial Domain Adaptation (CyCADA) framework that trains the\ntransformation model in an unpaired manner. In particular, Landsat-8 and\nProba-V satellites, which present different but compatible spatio-spectral\ncharacteristics, are used to illustrate the method. The obtained transformation\nsignificantly reduces differences between the image datasets while preserving\nthe spatial and spectral information of adapted images, which is hence useful\nfor any general purpose cross-sensor application. In addition, the training of\nthe proposed adversarial domain adaptation model can be modified to improve the\nperformance in a specific remote sensing application, such as cloud detection,\nby including a dedicated term in the cost function. Results show that, when the\nproposed transformation is applied, cloud detection models trained in Landsat-8\ndata increase cloud detection accuracy in Proba-V.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jun 2020 16:16:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-11"}

Such tasks require accurate control of\nfast movements and precise timing in the presence of imprecise state estimation\nof the flying ball and the robot. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has shown promise\nin learning of complex control tasks from data. However, applying step-based RL\nto dynamic tasks on real systems is safety-critical as RL requires exploring\nand failing safely for millions of time steps in high-speed regimes. In this\npaper, we demonstrate that safe learning of table tennis using model-free\nReinforcement Learning can be achieved by using robot arms driven by pneumatic\nartificial muscles (PAMs). Softness and back-drivability properties of PAMs\nprevent the system from leaving the safe region of its state space. In this\nmanner, RL empowers the robot to return and smash real balls with 5 m\\s and\n12m\\s on average to a desired landing point. Our setup allows the agent to\nlearn this safety-critical task (i) without safety constraints in the\nalgorithm, (ii) while maximizing the speed of returned balls directly in the\nreward function (iii) using a stochastic policy that acts directly on the\nlow-level controls of the real system and (iv) trains for thousands of trials\n(v) from scratch without any prior knowledge.

Together these states make up\n43% of the US population; some of these states appear to have handled their\ninitial outbreaks well, while others appear to be emerging hotspots. The\nevolution of Covid-19 is fairly similar among the states: variations in contact\nand recovery rates remain below 5%; however, not surprisingly, variations are\nlarger in death rate, reinfection rate, stay-at-home effect, and release rate\nfrom sequestration.

The refractive index of optical materials is widely measured in the\nliterature: it is both temperature and pressure dependent. The argument to\nestablish the dielectric constant's isentropic temperature dependence is a\nthermodynamic one and is thus applicable to all physical models that describe\nelectron clouds and electronic resonances within materials. The isentropic\nslope of the displacement field versus the electric field at all temperatures\nis described by an adiabatic dielectric constant in an energy-per-unit mass\nsystem. This slope is shown through the electronic part of the entropy to be\nunstable at high temperatures due to the change in the curvature of the\ntemperature dependence of the dielectric constant. The electronic entropy\ncontribution for optical, thermo-electro materials has negative heat capacities\nwhich are unacceptable. The dielectric constant's temperature and pressure\ndependence is predicted to be only dependent on the specific volume so\nisentropes are always positive. A new universal form for the dielectric\nconstant follows from this hypothesis: the dielectric constant is proportional\nto the square root of the specific volume.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jun 2020 17:29:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-11"}

The underlying idea is that, by harmonically exciting a\nmulti-stable origami at its resonance frequencies, one can induce rapid folding\nbetween its different stable equilibria without the need for using responsive\nmaterials. To this end, we use a bi-stable water-bomb base as an archetypal\nexample. Via numerical simulation based on a new dynamic model and experimental\ntesting, we show that the inherent asymmetry of waterbomb bi-stability can\nenable dynamic folding with relatively low actuation requirements. For example,\nif the water-bomb initially settles at its \"weak\" stable state, one can use a\nbase excitation to induce the intra-well resonance. As a result, the origami\nwould fold and remain at the other \"strong\" stable state even if the excitation\ndoes not stop. The origami dynamics starting from the strong state, on the\nother hand, is more complicated. The water-bomb origami is prone to show\ninter-well oscillation rather than a uni-directional switch due to a nonlinear\nrelationship between the dynamic folding behavior, asymmetric potential energy\nbarrier, the difference in resonance frequencies, and excitation amplitude.\nTherefore, we develop an active feedback control strategy, which cuts off the\nbase excitation input at the critical moment to achieve robust and\nuni-directional folding from the strong stable state to the weak one. The\nresults of this study can apply to many different kinds of origami and create a\nnew approach for rapid and reversible (self-)folding, thus advancing the\napplication of origami in shape morphing systems, adaptive structures, and\nreconfigurable robotics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jun 2020 17:29:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-11"}

The convergence rate of RR has attracted\nsubstantial attention recently and, for strongly convex and smooth functions,\nit was shown to converge faster than SGD if 1) the stepsize is small, 2) the\ngradients are bounded, and 3) the number of epochs is large.

Current approaches to the inverse\nproblem rely on parametric assumptions, physical approximations, e.g.\nmean-field theory, and ignoring higher-order interactions which may lead to\nbiased or incorrect estimates.

In this scenario, the galaxy is fueled by\ntwo distinct gas flows. One is enriched by outflows from massive galaxies, but\nnot the other. While the former feeds the inner galactic region, the latter\nfuels an outer gas disk, inclined with respect to the main galactic plane, and\nwith a significantly poorer chemical content. The first passage of the last\nmajor merger galaxy triggers tidal compression in the outer disk, which\nincreases the gas density and eventually leads to star formation, at a\nmetallicity 0.75 dex lower than the inner galaxy. This forms the first stars of\nthe low-[$\\alpha$/Fe] sequence. These in situ stars have halo-like kinematics,\nsimilarly to what is observed in the Milky Way, due to the inclination of the\nouter disk which eventually aligns with the inner one via gravitational\ntorques. We show that this tilting disk scenario is likely to be common in\nMilky-Way like galaxies. This process implies that the low-[$\\alpha$/Fe]\nsequence is populated in situ, simultaneously from two formation channels, in\nthe inner and the outer galaxy, with distinct metallicities. This contrasts\nwith purely sequential scenarios for the assembly of the Milky Way disk and\ncould be tested observationally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jun 2020 18:01:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2020 11:26:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 29 Mar 2021 06:13:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-21"}

We introduce the so-called\n$D=11$ pure spinor superparticle through BRST cohomology arguments starting\nfrom the semi-light-cone gauge $D=11$ Brink-Schwarz-like superparticle. After\nperforming a light-cone gauge analysis of the pure spinor BRST cohomology at\nghost number three, we find the linearized equations of motion of $D=11$\nsupergravity in $D=9$ superspace. In addition, we construct a BRST-closed,\nghost number one vertex operator made out of worldline fields and $D=11$\nsupergravity superfields, and we run into an inconsistency when constructing a\nghost number zero vertex operator satisfying a standard descent equation. We\nthen introduce the non-minimal version of the $D=11$ pure spinor superparticle,\nin which a composite $b$-ghost can be constructed satisfying $\\{Q,b\\} = P^{2}$.\nHowever, its complicated expression makes it difficult to check its nilpotency.\nWe show that introducing an $SO(1,10)$ fermionic vector $\\bar{\\Sigma}^{a}$\nsimplifies the form of the $b$-ghost considerably, which allows us to verify\nthat $\\{Q,b\\} = P^{2}$ and $\\{b,b\\}=$ BRST-exact. Using this $b$-ghost we\npropose an alternative ghost number zero vertex operator satisfying a standard\ndescent equation.

In the PET imaging system, glucose is labeled with a positron-emitting\nradionuclide and injected intravenously. Then, the positrons move through the\ntissue and collide with the electrons of the cells in which they interact. As a\nresult of this interaction, two gamma rays are emitted in the opposite\ndirection. Gama rays emitted from cancerous tissue that has retained\nradioactive glucose are detected through ring-shaped detectors. And the\ndetected signals are converted into an electrical response. Subsequently, these\nresponses are sampled with electronic circuits and recorded as histogram matrix\nto generate the image set. The gamma rays may not reach the detectors located\nin the opposite position in equal time. In PETs having TOF characteristics, it\nis aimed to obtain better positioning information by a method based on the\nprinciple of measuring the difference between the reach time of the two photons\nto detectors.

However, they still have a weak point in their\nCommand & Control (C&C) system, which is often based on centralized services or\nrequire a complex infrastructure to keep operating without being taken down by\nauthorities. The recent spread of blockchain technologies may give botnets a\npowerful tool to make them very hard to disrupt. Recent research showed how it\nis possible to embed C&C messages in Bitcoin transactions, making them nearly\nimpossible to block. Nevertheless, transactions have a cost and allow very\nlimited amounts of data to be transmitted. Because of that, only messages from\nthe botmaster to the bots are sent via Bitcoin, while bots are assumed to\ncommunicate through external channels.

When\ndigitizing the biopsy tissue samples using whole slide imaging (WSI), a set of\nserial sections from the same tissue can be acquired as a stack of images,\nsimilar to frames in a video. In radiology, the stack of images (e.g., computed\ntomography) are naturally used to provide 3D context for organs, tissues, and\ntumors. In pathology, it is appealing to do a similar 3D assessment. However,\nthe 3D identification and association of large-scale glomeruli on renal\npathology is challenging due to large tissue deformation, missing tissues, and\nartifacts from WSI. In this paper, we propose a novel Multi-object Association\nfor Pathology in 3D (Map3D) method for automatically identifying and\nassociating large-scale cross-sections of 3D objects from routine serial\nsectioning and WSI. The innovations of the Map3D method are three-fold: (1) the\nlarge-scale glomerular association is formed as a new multi-object tracking\n(MOT) perspective; (2) the quality-aware whole series registration is proposed\nto not only provide affinity estimation but also offer automatic kidney-wise\nquality assurance (QA) for registration; (3) a dual-path association method is\nproposed to tackle the large deformation, missing tissues, and artifacts during\ntracking.

High dimensional features and decisions given by deep neural\nnetworks (NN) require new algorithms and methods to expose its mechanisms.\nCurrent state-of-the-art NN interpretation methods (e.g. Saliency maps,\nDeepLIFT, LIME, etc.) focus more on the direct relationship between NN outputs\nand inputs rather than the NN structure and operations itself. In current deep\nNN operations, there is uncertainty over the exact role played by neurons with\nfixed activation functions. In this paper, we achieve partially explainable\nlearning model by symbolically explaining the role of activation functions (AF)\nunder a scalable topology. This is carried out by modeling the AFs as adaptive\nGaussian Processes (GP), which sit within a novel scalable NN topology, based\non the Kolmogorov-Arnold Superposition Theorem (KST). In this scalable NN\narchitecture, the AFs are generated by GP interpolation between control points\nand can thus be tuned during the back-propagation procedure via gradient\ndescent. The control points act as the core enabler to both local and global\nadjustability of AF, where the GP interpolation constrains the intrinsic\nautocorrelation to avoid over-fitting. We show that there exists a trade-off\nbetween the NN's expressive power and interpretation complexity, under linear\nKST topology scaling. To demonstrate this, we perform a case study on a binary\nclassification dataset of banknote authentication. By quantitatively and\nqualitatively investigating the mapping relationship between inputs and output,\nour explainable model can provide interpretation over each of the\none-dimensional attributes.

While most\ngradient free methods have slow convergence rate, the Langevin Monte Carlo\n(LMC) that provides fast convergence requires the computation of gradients. In\npractice one uses finite-differencing approximations as surrogates, and the\nmethod is expensive in high-dimensions.\n  A natural strategy to reduce computational cost in each iteration is to\nutilize random gradient approximations, such as random coordinate descent (RCD)\nor simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA). We show by a\ncounter-example that blindly applying RCD does not achieve the goal in the most\ngeneral setting. The high variance induced by the randomness means a larger\nnumber of iterations are needed, and this balances out the saving in each\niteration.\n  We then introduce a new variance reduction approach, termed Randomized\nCoordinates Averaging Descent (RCAD), and incorporate it with both overdamped\nand underdamped LMC. The methods are termed RCAD-O-LMC and RCAD-U-LMC\nrespectively. The methods still sit in the random gradient approximation\nframework, and thus the computational cost in each iteration is low.

Movements that convey affect can also give machines\nlife-like attributes and help to create a more engaging human-machine\ninteraction. This paper presents an approach for automatic affective movement\ngeneration that makes use of two movement abstractions: 1) Laban movement\nanalysis (LMA), and 2) hidden Markov modeling. The LMA provides a systematic\ntool for an abstract representation of the kinematic and expressive\ncharacteristics of movements. Given a desired motion path on which a target\nemotion is to be overlaid, the proposed approach searches a labeled dataset in\nthe LMA Effort and Shape space for similar movements to the desired motion path\nthat convey the target emotion. An HMM abstraction of the identified movements\nis obtained and used with the desired motion path to generate a novel movement\nthat is a modulated version of the desired motion path that conveys the target\nemotion. The extent of modulation can be varied, trading-off between kinematic\nand affective constraints in the generated movement. The proposed approach is\ntested using a full-body movement dataset. The efficacy of the proposed\napproach in generating movements with recognizable target emotions is assessed\nusing a validated automatic recognition model and a user study. The target\nemotions were correctly recognized from the generated movements at a rate of\n72% using the recognition model. Furthermore, participants in the user study\nwere able to correctly perceive the target emotions from a sample of generated\nmovements, although some cases of confusion were also observed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jun 2020 21:24:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-12"}

First we introduce a principled way of formulating the unsupervised\ndenoising problem within the VAE framework by explicitly incorporating imaging\nnoise models into the decoder. Our approach is fully unsupervised, only\nrequiring noisy images and a suitable description of the imaging noise\ndistribution. We show that such a noise model can either be measured,\nbootstrapped from noisy data, or co-learned during training.

Unfortunately, the empirical nature\nof the Curie-von Schweidler law plagues the applications of the fractional\ncapacitor. Here, we derive the Curie-von Schweidler law from a series\ncombination of a resistor and a capacitor with a linear time-varying\ncapacitance.

However, this required a modification of the classical\ncharge--voltage relation of a capacitor to account for the time-varying\ncapacitance. The limitation of the classical charge-voltage relation and its\nsubsequent modification are justified using appropriate circuit modeling.\nConsequently, the parameters of the Curie-von Schweidler law and the fractional\ncapacitor gain physical interpretation.

In addition, small samples of finite size are known to exhibit\nsystematic deviations of thermodynamic quantities relative to their bulk\nvalues. Here, we consider the static structure factor of a liquid sample in\nslab geometry with open boundaries at the surfaces, which can be thought of as\nvirtually cutting out the sample from a macroscopically large, homogeneous\nfluid. This situation is a relevant limit for the interpretation of\ngrazing-incidence diffraction experiments at liquid interfaces and films. We\nderive an exact, closed expression for the slab structure factor, with the bulk\nstructure factor as the only input. This shows that such free boundary\nconditions cause significant differences between the two structure factors, in\nparticular at small wavenumbers. An asymptotic analysis of this result yields\nthe scaling exponent and an accurate, useful approximation of these finite-size\ncorrections. Furthermore, the open boundaries permit the interpretation of the\nslab as an open system, supporting particle exchange with a reservoir. We\nrelate the slab structure factor to the particle number fluctuations and\ndiscuss conditions under which the subvolume of the slab represents a grand\ncanonical ensemble with chemical potential $\\mu$ and temperature $T$. Thus, the\nopen slab serves as a test-bed for the small-system thermodynamics in a $\\mu T$\nreservoir.

In\nmachine learning research, however, synthesizing dance movements from music is\na challenging problem. Recently, researchers synthesize human motion sequences\nthrough autoregressive models like recurrent neural network (RNN). Such an\napproach often generates short sequences due to an accumulation of prediction\nerrors that are fed back into the neural network. This problem becomes even\nmore severe in the long motion sequence generation. Besides, the consistency\nbetween dance and music in terms of style, rhythm and beat is yet to be taken\ninto account during modeling. In this paper, we formalize the music-conditioned\ndance generation as a sequence-to-sequence learning problem and devise a novel\nseq2seq architecture to efficiently process long sequences of music features\nand capture the fine-grained correspondence between music and dance.\nFurthermore, we propose a novel curriculum learning strategy to alleviate error\naccumulation of autoregressive models in long motion sequence generation, which\ngently changes the training process from a fully guided teacher-forcing scheme\nusing the previous ground-truth movements, towards a less guided autoregressive\nscheme mostly using the generated movements instead.

The $Q$-function, when viewed as a\nkernel, induces a Hilbert-Schmidt operator and hence possesses square-summable\nspectrum. This motivates us to consider a parametric class of $Q$-functions\nparameterized by its \"rank\" $r$, which contains all Lipschitz $Q$-functions as\n$r \\to \\infty$. As our key contribution, we develop a simple, iterative\nlearning algorithm that finds $\\epsilon$-optimal $Q$-function with sample\ncomplexity of $\\widetilde{O}(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon^{\\max(d_1, d_2)+2}})$ when the\noptimal $Q$-function has low rank $r$ and the discounting factor $\\gamma$ is\nbelow a certain threshold. Thus, this provides an exponential improvement in\nsample complexity. To enable our result, we develop a novel Matrix Estimation\nalgorithm that faithfully estimates an unknown low-rank matrix in the\n$\\ell_\\infty$ sense even in the presence of arbitrary bounded noise, which\nmight be of interest in its own right. Empirical results on several stochastic\ncontrol tasks confirm the efficacy of our \"low-rank\" algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 2020 00:55:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-12"}

In the\nclassical framework, for simplicity, the claim frequency and claim severities\nare assumed to be mutually independent. However, there is a growing interest in\nrelaxing this independence assumption which is more realistic and useful for\nthe practical insurance ratemaking. While the common thread has been capturing\nthe dependence between frequency and aggregate severity within a single period,\nthe work of Oh et al.

Phases of\nnodes within a splay cluster are equally spaced, but nodes in different splay\nclusters have an arbitrary phase difference that can be fixed or evolve\nlinearly in time. Such coexisting splay clusters form a decoupled state in that\nthe dynamical equations become effectively decoupled between oscillators that\ncan be physically coupled.

However, different lines breathe\ndifferently, and some high-ionization lines, such as C IV, can even show\n\"anti-breathing\" where the line broadens when luminosity increases.

Here we investigate a sympathetic event\ninvolving successive eruptions of two filaments on 2015 November 15-16, which\npresented abundant sympathetic characteristics. The two filaments (F1 and F2)\nwere separated by a narrow region of negative polarity, and F1 firstly erupted,\nproducing a two-ribbon flare. When the outward-spreading ribbon produced by F1\napproached stable F2, a weak brightening was observed to the south of F2 and\nthen spread northward, inward approaching F2. Behind this inward-spreading\nbrightening, a dimming region characterized by a plasma density reduction of\n30% was extending. NLFFF extrapolations with a time sequence reveal that fields\nabove pre-eruption F1 and F2 constituted a quadrupolar magnetic system with a\npossible null point. Moreover, the null point kept moving towards F2 and\ndescending within the following hours.We infer that the rising F1 pushed its\noverlying fields towards the fields above stable F2 and caused successive\nexternal reconnection between the overlying fields. From outside to inside\n(lower and lower in height), the fields above pre-eruption F2 were gradually\ninvolved in the reconnection, manifesting as the inward-spreading brightening\nand extending dimming on the south side of F2. Furthermore, the external\nreconnection could reconfigure the overlying fields of F2 by transporting\nmagnetic flux from its west part to the east part, which is further verified by\nthe subsequent partial eruption of F2. We propose an integrated evidence chain\nto demonstrate the critical roles of external magnetic reconnection and the\nresultant reconfiguration of overlying fields on the sympathetic eruptions of\ntwo filaments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 2020 04:58:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

Recent works leverage the power of\ndeep learning for registering a pair of point sets. However, unfortunately,\ndeep learning models often require a large number of ground truth labels for\ntraining. Moreover, for a pair of source and target point sets, existing deep\nlearning mechanisms require explicitly designed encoders to extract both deep\nspatial features from unstructured point clouds and their spatial correlation\nrepresentation, which is further fed to a decoder to regress the desired\ngeometric transformation for point set alignment. To further enhance deep\nlearning models for point set registration, this paper proposes Deep-3DAligner,\na novel unsupervised registration framework based on a newly introduced deep\nSpatial Correlation Representation (SCR) feature. The SCR feature describes the\ngeometric essence of the spatial correlation between source and target point\nsets in an encoding-free manner. More specifically, our method starts with\noptimizing a randomly initialized latent SCR feature, which is then decoded to\na geometric transformation (i.e., rotation and translation) to align source and\ntarget point sets. Our Deep-3DAligner jointly updates the SCR feature and\nweights of the transformation decoder towards the minimization of an\nunsupervised alignment loss. We conducted experiments on the ModelNet40\ndatasets to validate the performance of our unsupervised Deep-3DAligner for\npoint set registration. The results demonstrated that, even without ground\ntruth and any assumption of a direct correspondence between source and target\npoint sets for training, our proposed approach achieved comparative performance\ncompared to most recent supervised state-of-the-art approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 2020 05:21:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-12"}

The angular streaking of the\nelectrons by the rotating laser field acts as an attoclock, encoding the\nionization dynamics onto the electron ejection angle.

In the 2D case, the classical approach is\nto compute the linear correlation coefficient from a scatterplot. This method,\nhowever, implicitly assumes a linear relationship between the variables. Such\nan assumption is not always correct. With the use of the partial correlation\ncoefficients, an extension to the multidimensional case is possible. However,\nthe problem of the assumed mutual linear relationship of the variables remains.\nA relatively recent approach that makes it possible to avoid this problem is\nthe modeling of the joint probability density function (PDF) of the data with\ncopulas. These are functions that contain all the information on the\nrelationship between two random variables. Although in principle this approach\nalso can work with multidimensional data, theoretical as well computational\ndifficulties often limit its use to the 2D case. In this paper, we consider an\napproach based on so-called vine copulas, which overcomes this limitation and\nat the same time is amenable to a theoretical treatment and feasible from the\ncomputational point of view. We applied this method to published data on the\nnear-IR and far-IR luminosities and atomic and molecular masses of the Herschel\nreference sample, a volume-limited sample in the nearby Universe. We determined\nthe relationship of the luminosities and gas masses and show that the far-IR\nluminosity can be considered as the key parameter relating the other three\nquantities. Once removed from the 4D relation, the residual relation among the\nlatter is negligible. This may be interpreted as the correlation between the\ngas masses and near-IR luminosity being driven by the far-IR luminosity, likely\nby the star formation activity of the galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 2020 09:18:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Sep 2020 15:03:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-21"}

In this paper, we\npropose a Dense SegU-net (DSU-net) framework for automatic NPC segmentation in\nMRI. Our contribution is threefold. First, different from the traditional\ndecoder in U-net using upconvolution for upsamling, we argue that the\nrestoration from low resolution features to high resolution output should be\ncapable of preserving information significant for precise boundary\nlocalization. Hence, we use unpooling to unsample and propose SegU-net. Second,\nto combat the potential vanishing-gradient problem, we introduce dense blocks\nwhich can facilitate feature propagation and reuse.

This motivates\nmany researchers to continuously develop new optimization algorithms. In this\npaper, a novel nature-inspired meta-heuristic optimization algorithm called\nvirus spread optimization (VSO) is proposed. VSO loosely mimics the spread of\nviruses among hosts, and can be effectively applied to solving many challenging\nand continuous optimization problems. We devise a new representation scheme and\nviral operations that are radically different from previously proposed\nvirus-based optimization algorithms. First, the viral RNA of each host in VSO\ndenotes a potential solution for which different viral operations will help to\ndiversify the searching strategies in order to largely enhance the solution\nquality. In addition, an imported infection mechanism, inheriting the searched\noptima from another colony, is introduced to possibly avoid the prematuration\nof any potential solution in solving complex problems. VSO has an excellent\ncapability to conduct adaptive neighborhood searches around the discovered\noptima for achieving better solutions. Furthermore, with a flexible infection\nmechanism, VSO can quickly escape from local optima. To clearly demonstrate\nboth its effectiveness and efficiency, VSO is critically evaluated on a series\nof well-known benchmark functions. Moreover, VSO is validated on its\napplicability through two real-world examples including the financial portfolio\noptimization and optimization of hyper-parameters of support vector machines\nfor classification problems. The results show that VSO has attained superior\nperformance in terms of solution fitness, convergence rate, scalability,\nreliability, and flexibility when compared to those results of the conventional\nas well as state-of-the-art meta-heuristic optimization algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 2020 09:35:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-12"}

So that, the L-P\neffect deviation from the usual geometrical constrictions is due to the\ninterplay between local magnetic stray fields and superconducting vortices.\nMoreover, we compare our results with a low-stray field sample (i.e. with the\ndots in magnetic vortex state) showing how the enhancement of the L-P effect\ncan be explained by an increment of the effective size of the nanodots.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 2020 10:26:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-26"}

These\ninclude - reliance on ratings of very few respondents to infer about all\ncustomers' online interactions; failing to capture a customer's interactions\nover time since the rating is a one-time snapshot; and inability to tie back\ncustomers' ratings to specific interactions because ratings provided relate to\nall interactions.

Yet, on\nvalidation against actual survey data, proxy ratings yield reasonable\nperformance results. Additionally, we offer a new way to draw insights from\nvalues of the value function, which allow associating specific interactions to\ntheir proxy ratings. We introduce two new metrics to represent ratings - one,\ncustomer-level and the other, aggregate-level for click actions across\ncustomers. Both are defined around proportion of all pairwise, successive\nactions that show increase in proxy ratings. This intuitive customer-level\nmetric enables gauging the dynamics of ratings over time and is a better\npredictor of purchase than customer ratings from survey. The aggregate-level\nmetric allows pinpointing actions that help or hurt experience. In sum, proxy\nratings computed unobtrusively from clickstream, for every action, for each\ncustomer, and for every session can offer interpretable and more insightful\nalternative to surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 2020 10:41:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-14"}

Medical image analysis (MedIA) systems have recently\nbeen argued to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks due to strong financial\nincentives and the associated technological infrastructure.\n  In this paper, we study previously unexplored factors affecting adversarial\nattack vulnerability of deep learning MedIA systems in three medical domains:\nophthalmology, radiology, and pathology. We focus on adversarial black-box\nsettings, in which the attacker does not have full access to the target model\nand usually uses another model, commonly referred to as surrogate model, to\ncraft adversarial examples. We consider this to be the most realistic scenario\nfor MedIA systems.\n  Firstly, we study the effect of weight initialization (ImageNet vs. random)\non the transferability of adversarial attacks from the surrogate model to the\ntarget model. Secondly, we study the influence of differences in development\ndata between target and surrogate models. We further study the interaction of\nweight initialization and data differences with differences in model\narchitecture. All experiments were done with a perturbation degree tuned to\nensure maximal transferability at minimal visual perceptibility of the attacks.\n  Our experiments show that pre-training may dramatically increase the\ntransferability of adversarial examples, even when the target and surrogate's\narchitectures are different: the larger the performance gain using\npre-training, the larger the transferability. Differences in the development\ndata between target and surrogate models considerably decrease the performance\nof the attack; this decrease is further amplified by difference in the model\narchitecture. We believe these factors should be considered when developing\nsecurity-critical MedIA systems planned to be deployed in clinical practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 2020 12:19:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2020 08:36:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 17 Jun 2021 12:50:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-23"}

An influential method to tackle this problem without storing\nold data are so-called regularisation approaches. They measure the importance\nof each parameter for solving a given task and subsequently protect important\nparameters from large changes. In the literature, three ways to measure\nparameter importance have been put forward and they have inspired a large body\nof follow-up work.

Moreover, bounding methods generally do not\nallow for a continuum of assumptions on the shape of the causal effect that can\nsmoothly trade off stronger background knowledge for more informative bounds.\nIn this work, we provide a method for causal effect bounding in continuous\ndistributions, leveraging recent advances in gradient-based methods for the\noptimization of computationally intractable objective functions.

In this context, signal reconstruction amounts to solving a joint\nconstrained optimisation problem, yielding estimates of both the Fourier series\ncoefficients of the Dirac stream and its so-called annihilating filter,\ninvolved in the regularisation term.

The latter\nassumption is a natural adaptation of classic smoothness assumptions in\nnonparametric regression, which are known as source conditions in the the\ncontext of regularization theory for inverse problems. Roughly speaking, we\nassume the large coefficients of the parameter are in correspondence to the\nprincipal components. In this setting a precise characterisation of the test\nerror is obtained, depending on the inputs covariance and regression parameter\nstructure.

The energy source that triggers these mass eruptions and\ndynamics of the outflow have not been clearly explained. Moreover, the mass\neruption itself can alter the density structure of the envelope and affect the\ndynamics of the subsequent mass eruption if these events are repeated. A large\namount of observational evidence suggests multiple mass eruptions prior to core\ncollapse. We investigate the density structure of the envelope altered by the\nfirst mass eruption and the nature of the subsequent second mass eruption event\nin comparison with the first event. We deposited extra energy at the bottom of\nthe hydrogen envelope of 15$M_\\odot$ stars twice and calculated the time\nevolution by radiation hydrodynamical simulation code.

There are significant differences between\nthe first and second mass eruptions in terms of the luminosity and the color.\nThe second eruption leads to a redder burst event in which the associated\nbrightening phase lasts longer than the first. The amount of ejected matter is\ndifferent even with the same deposited energy in the first and second event,\nbut the difference depends on the density structure of the star.

This forces the decision maker to inspect the decision\nvariables of each solution individually, potentially making navigation of the\napproximation set unintuitive. In this work, we aim to improve approximation\nset navigability by enforcing a form of smoothness or continuity between\nsolutions in terms of their decision variables. Imposing smoothness as a\nrestriction upon common domination-based multi-objective evolutionary\nalgorithms is not straightforward. Therefore, we use the recently introduced\nuncrowded hypervolume (UHV) to reformulate the multi-objective optimization\nproblem as a single-objective problem in which parameterized approximation sets\nare directly optimized. We study here the case of parameterizing approximation\nsets as smooth Bezier curves in decision space. We approach the resulting\nsingle-objective problem with the gene-pool optimal mixing evolutionary\nalgorithm (GOMEA), and we call the resulting algorithm BezEA. We analyze the\nbehavior of BezEA and compare it to optimization of the UHV with GOMEA as well\nas the domination-based multi-objective GOMEA. We show that high-quality\napproximation sets can be obtained with BezEA, sometimes even outperforming the\ndomination- and UHV-based algorithms, while smoothness of the navigation\ntrajectory through decision space is guaranteed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 2020 13:57:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-12"}

Here we apply a full field crystal\nplasticity model utilizing a dislocation density based constitutive theory to\nstudy the deformation and texture evolution in copper (Cu) under plane strain\ncompression. Additionally, we use the phase field method, along with a\nstochastic nucleation model, for static recrystallization simulations.\nSimulation results show that the volume fraction of the cube component during\ndeformation decreases with increasing strain. Although cube grains are not\nstable during plane strain compression, some of the non-cube grains rotate\ntowards cube and develop narrow cube bands near the grain boundary region. With\nincreasing deformation, the cube component accumulates dislocation density\nfaster than other texture components. High stored energy in the cube regions\nleads to preferential nucleation of cube grains during static\nrecrystallization. These cube nuclei originate from the intergranular cube\nbands. Although the cube component has a clear nucleation advantage, none of\nthe texture component appears to have a growth advantage. Instead, simulation\nresults show that heterogeneous distribution of nuclei has a profound influence\non the resulting grain size distribution. During recrystallization, a\nsignificant increase in cube volume fraction is observed mainly due to high\nnucleation frequency of cube grains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 2020 14:37:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-29"}

The mechanism behind this infinite resistance is the linear\ncharge confinement by a magnetic monopole plasma.

It is motivated by the application of fountain codes\nin DNA-based data storage systems where the inner code decoding, which\ngenerally has undetectable errors, is performed before the outer fountain code\ndecoding. We propose a novel and efficient decoding algorithm, namely\nbasis-finding algorithm (BFA), followed by three implementations. The key idea\nof the BFA is to find a basis of the received symbols, and then use the most\nreliable basis elements to recover the source symbols with the inactivation\ndecoding. Gaussian elimination is used to find the basis and to identify the\nmost reliable basis elements. As a result, the BFA has polynomial time\ncomplexity. For random fountain codes, we are able to derive some theoretical\nbounds for the frame error rate (FER) of the BFA. Extensive simulations with\nLuby transform (LT) codes show that, the BFA has significantly lower FER than\nthe belief propagation (BP) algorithm except for an extremely large amount of\nreceived symbols, and the FER of the BFA generally decreases as the average\nweight of basis elements increases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 2020 15:01:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 18 Oct 2020 04:06:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 24 Feb 2021 08:28:17 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 28 Jan 2023 14:18:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-31"}

While transfer learning assumes\nthat the learning process for a target task will benefit from re-using\nrepresentations learned for another task, anti-transfer avoids the learning of\nrepresentations that have been learned for an orthogonal task, i.e., one that\nis not relevant and potentially misleading for the target task, such as speaker\nidentity for speech recognition or speech content for emotion recognition. In\nanti-transfer learning, we penalize similarity between activations of a network\nbeing trained and another one previously trained on an orthogonal task, which\nyields more suitable representations. This leads to better generalization and\nprovides a degree of control over correlations that are spurious or\nundesirable, e.g. to avoid social bias. We have implemented anti-transfer for\nconvolutional neural networks in different configurations with several\nsimilarity metrics and aggregation functions, which we evaluate and analyze\nwith several speech and audio tasks and settings, using six datasets. We show\nthat anti-transfer actually leads to the intended invariance to the orthogonal\ntask and to more appropriate features for the target task at hand.\nAnti-transfer learning consistently improves classification accuracy in all\ntest cases. While anti-transfer creates computation and memory cost at training\ntime, there is relatively little computation cost when using pre-trained models\nfor orthogonal tasks. Anti-transfer is widely applicable and particularly\nuseful where a specific invariance is desirable or where trained models are\navailable and labeled data for orthogonal tasks are difficult to obtain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 2020 15:03:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2021 11:15:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-14"}

In a nutshell, the task of a local fast failover\nalgorithm is to pre-define fast failover rules for each node using locally\navailable information only. These rules determine for each incoming link from\nwhich a packet may arrive and the set of local link failures (i.e., the failed\nlinks incident to a node), on which outgoing link a packet should be forwarded.\nIdeally, such a local fast failover algorithm provides a perfect resilience\ndeterministically: a packet emitted from any source can reach any target, as\nlong as the underlying network remains connected. Feigenbaum et al. (ACM PODC\n2012) and also Chiesa et al. (IEEE/ACM Trans. Netw. 2017) showed that it is not\nalways possible to provide perfect resilience. Interestingly, not much more is\nknown currently about the feasibility of perfect resilience.\n  This paper revisits perfect resilience with local fast failover, both in a\nmodel where the source can and cannot be used for forwarding decisions. We\nfirst derive several fairly general impossibility results: By establishing a\nconnection between graph minors and resilience, we prove that it is impossible\nto achieve perfect resilience on any non-planar graph; furthermore, while\nplanarity is necessary, it is also not sufficient for perfect resilience. On\nthe positive side, we show that graph families closed under link subdivision\nallow for simple and efficient failover algorithms which simply skip failed\nlinks. We demonstrate this technique by deriving perfect resilience for\nouterplanar graphs and related scenarios, as well as for scenarios where the\nsource and target are topologically close after failures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 2020 15:30:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2020 17:55:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-04"}

Several investigations have discussed, in an inexplicit way, the\nconnections between both concepts, hinting at that nonzero topological charges\nfor far-field polarizations on a loop is inextricably linked to its nontrivial\nBerry phase when degeneracies are enclosed. In this work, we reexamine the\nseminal photonic crystal slab that supports the fundamental two-level\nnonhermitian degeneracies. Regardless of the invariance of nontrivial Berry\nphase for different loops enclosing both exceptional points, we demonstrate\nthat the associated polarization fields exhibit topologically inequivalent\npatterns that are characterized by variant topological charges, including even\nthe trivial scenario of zero charge. It is further revealed that for both\nbands, the seemingly complex evolutions of polarizations are bounded by the\nglobal charge conservation, with extra points of circular polarizations playing\nindispensable roles. This indicates that tough not directly associated with any\nlocal charges, the invariant Berry phase is directly linked to the globally\nconserved charge, the physical principles underlying which have all been\nfurther clarified by a modified Berry-Dennis model.

A\ntypical self-training method is to use pseudo-labels generated by clustering\nalgorithms to iteratively optimize the model on the target domain. However, a\ndrawback to this is that noisy pseudo-labels generally cause trouble in\nlearning. To address this problem, a mutual learning method by dual networks\nhas been developed to produce reliable soft labels. However, as the two neural\nnetworks gradually converge, their complementarity is weakened and they likely\nbecome biased towards the same kind of noise. This paper proposes a novel\nlight-weight module, the Attentive WaveBlock (AWB), which can be integrated\ninto the dual networks of mutual learning to enhance the complementarity and\nfurther depress noise in the pseudo-labels. Specifically, we first introduce a\nparameter-free module, the WaveBlock, which creates a difference between\nfeatures learned by two networks by waving blocks of feature maps differently.\nThen, an attention mechanism is leveraged to enlarge the difference created and\ndiscover more complementary features.

But tension with\nthe data is growing in several other areas, including measurements of the\nHubble constant H(z) and the BAO scale, which directly or indirectly impact the\nphysics at the surface of last scattering (LSS). The R_h=ct universe resolves\nat least some of this tension. We show in this paper that---if the BAO scale is\nin fact equal to the acoustic horizon---the redshift of the LSS in this\ncosmology is z_cmb ~ 16, placing it within the era of Pop III star formation,\nprior to the epoch of reionization at 15 > z > 6. Quite remarkably, the\nmeasured values of z_cmb and H_0 = H(0) in this model are sufficient to argue\nthat the CMB temperature today ought to be ~ 3 K, so H_0 and the baryon to\nphoton ratio are not independent free parameters. This scenario might have\nresulted from rethermalization of the CMB photons by dust, presumably supplied\nto the interstellar medium by the ejecta of Pop III stars. Dust\nrethermalization may therefore yet resurface as a relevant ingredient in the\nR_h=ct universe. Upcoming high sensitivity instruments should be able to\nreadily distinguish between the recombination and dust scenarios by either (i)\ndetecting recombination lines at z ~ 1080, or (ii) establishing a robust\nfrequency-dependent variation of the CMB power spectrum at the level of ~ 2-4%\nacross the sampled frequency range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 2020 11:02:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-10"}

To illustrate the general range of phenomena\nexhibited by mixture-particle systems, we simulate the effects of\nsingle-particle, multi-particle, and cluster-particle systems having multiple\ngeometrical configurations of the particle characteristic of pattern substrates\non phase separation. Our simulations show that tailoring the particle\nconfiguration, or substrate pattern configuration, a relative fluid-particle\ncomposition should allow the desirable control of the phase separation\nmorphology as in block copolymer materials, but where the scales accessible to\nthis approach of organizing phase-separated fluids usually are significantly\nlarger. Limited experiments confirm the trends observed in our simulations,\nwhich should provide some guidance in engineering patterned blend and other\nmixtures of technological interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jun 2020 16:40:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-16"}

The proposed optimization can automatically fit these\nparameters from the results of an oedometric and a triaxial drained compression\ntest, by combining the GA with a numerical solver that integrates the SH in the\ntest conditions.

A salient aspect that distinguishes these\nnumerical methods is how they approximate the physical fields of interest.\nPhysics-informed deep learning is a novel approach recently developed for\nmodeling PDE solutions and shows promise to solve computational mechanics\nproblems without using any labeled data. The philosophy behind it is to\napproximate the quantity of interest (e.g., PDE solution variables) by a deep\nneural network (DNN) and embed the physical law to regularize the network. To\nthis end, training the network is equivalent to minimization of a well-designed\nloss function that contains the PDE residuals and initial/boundary conditions\n(I/BCs). In this paper, we present a physics-informed neural network (PINN)\nwith mixed-variable output to model elastodynamics problems without resort to\nlabeled data, in which the I/BCs are hardly imposed. In particular, both the\ndisplacement and stress components are taken as the DNN output, inspired by the\nhybrid finite element analysis, which largely improves the accuracy and\ntrainability of the network. Since the conventional PINN framework augments all\nthe residual loss components in a \"soft\" manner with Lagrange multipliers, the\nweakly imposed I/BCs cannot not be well satisfied especially when complex I/BCs\nare present. To overcome this issue, a composite scheme of DNNs is established\nbased on multiple single DNNs such that the I/BCs can be satisfied forcibly in\na \"hard\" manner. The propose PINN framework is demonstrated on several\nnumerical elasticity examples with different I/BCs, including both static and\ndynamic problems as well as wave propagation in truncated domains.

Traditional\nstatistical/ML methods are inefficient to capture chaos in nonlinear dynamical\nsystems, especially when the time difference $\\Delta t$ between consecutive\nsteps is so large that a trivial, ergodic local minimum would most likely be\nreached instead. Here, we introduce a new long-short-term-memory (LSTM)-based\nrecurrent architecture by tensorizing the cell-state-to-state propagation\ntherein, keeping the long-term memory feature of LSTM while simultaneously\nenhancing the learning of short-term nonlinear complexity. We stress that the\nglobal minima of chaos can be most efficiently reached by tensorization where\nall nonlinear terms, up to some polynomial order, are treated explicitly and\nweighted equally. The efficiency and generality of our architecture are\nsystematically tested and confirmed by theoretical analysis and experimental\nresults. In our design, we have explicitly used two different many-body\nentanglement structures---matrix product states (MPS) and the multiscale\nentanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA)---as physics-inspired tensor\ndecomposition techniques, from which we find that MERA generally performs\nbetter than MPS, hence conjecturing that the learnability of chaos is\ndetermined not only by the number of free parameters but also the tensor\ncomplexity---recognized as how entanglement entropy scales with varying\nmatricization of the tensor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jun 2020 23:03:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-29"}

The documentation details a network's structure and context, serves\nas a reference and makes network management more effective. Complex network\ndiagrams are hard to document and maintain and are not guaranteed to reflect\nreality. They contain many superficial icons (e.g., wall, screen and tower).\nDefining a single coherent network architecture and topology, similar to\nengineering schematics, has received great interest. We propose a fundamental\napproach for methodically specifying a network architecture using a diagramming\nmethod to conceptualize the network s structure. The method is called a\nthinging (abstract) machine, through which the network world is viewed as a\nsingle unifying element called the thing/machine (thimac), providing the\nontology for modeling the network. To test its viability, the\nthinging-machine-based methodology was applied to an existing computer network\nto produce a single integrated, diagrammatic representation that incorporates\ncommunication, software and hardware. The resultant description shows a viable,\ncoherent depiction that can replace the current methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 2020 11:14:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}
