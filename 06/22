It is known that when the digraphs are\nstrongly connected, global synchronization can be achieved by using a class of\ndeterministic set-valued reset controllers. However, for large-scale networks,\nthese algorithms are not scalable because some of their tuning parameters have\nupper bounds of the order of O(1/N), where N is the number of agents. This\npaper resolves this scalability issue by presenting several new results in the\ncontext of global synchronization of PCOs with more general network topologies\nusing deterministic and stochastic hybrid dynamical systems. First, we\nestablish that similar deterministic resetting algorithms can achieve robust,\nglobal, and fixed-time synchronization in any rooted acyclic digraph. Moreover,\nin this case we show that the synchronization dynamics are now scalable as the\ntuning parameters of the algorithm are network independent, i.e., of order\nO(1). However, the algorithms cannot be further extended to all rooted\ndigraphs. We establish this new impossibility result by introducing a\ncounterexample with a particular rooted digraph for which global\nsynchronization cannot be achieved, irrespective of the tuning of the reset\nrule. Nevertheless, we show that if the resetting algorithms are modified by\naccommodating an Erdos-Renyi type random graph model, then the resulting\nstochastic resetting dynamics will guarantee global synchronization almost\nsurely for all rooted digraphs and, moreover, the tunable parameters of the\ndynamics are network independent. Stability and robustness properties of the\nresetting algorithms are studied using the tools from set-valued hybrid\ndynamical systems. Numerical simulations are provided at the end of the paper\nfor demonstration of the main results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Jun 2020 17:39:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-23"}

In each district, the party\nwhose candidate gets the maximum number of votes wins the corresponding seat.\nThe result of the election is decided based on the number of seats won by the\ndifferent parties. The electors (voters) can cast their votes only in the\ndistrict of their residence. Thus, locations of the electors and boundaries of\nthe districts may severely affect the election result even if the proportion of\npopular support (number of electors) of different parties remains unchanged.\nThis has led to significant amount of research on whether the districts may be\nredrawn or electors may be moved to maximize seats for a particular party. In\nthis paper, we frame the spatial distribution of electors in a probabilistic\nsetting, and explore different models to capture the intra-district\npolarization of electors in favour of a party, or the spatial concentration of\nsupporters of different parties. Our models are inspired by elections in India,\nwhere supporters of different parties tend to be concentrated in certain\ndistricts.

Since this approach is\nhighly time-consuming, we explore how supervised regression using Logistic\nRegression or Deep Neural Networks can be used to speed it up.

Through\napplication of rotor yaw to multirotor turbines, a new degree of freedom is\nintroduced to wind farm control such that wakes can be expanded, channelled, or\nredirected to improve inflow conditions for downstream turbines. Five different\nyaw configurations are investigated (including a baseline case) by employing\nlarge-eddy simulations (LES) to generate a detailed representation of the\nvelocity field downwind of a multirotor wind turbine. Two lower-fidelity models\nfrom single-rotor yaw studies (curled-wake model and analytical Gaussian wake\nmodel) are extended to the multirotor case and their results are compared with\nthe LES data. For each model, the wake is analysed primarily by examining wake\ncross sections at different downwind distances. Further quantitative analysis\nis carried out through characterisations of wake centroids and widths over a\nrange of streamwise locations, and through a brief analysis of power\nproduction. Most significantly, it is shown that rotor yaw can have a\nconsiderable impact on both the distribution and magnitude of the wake velocity\ndeficit, leading to power gains for downstream turbines. The lower-fidelity\nmodels show small deviation from the LES results for specific configurations;\nhowever, both are able to reasonably capture the wake trends over a large\nstreamwise range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 21 Jun 2020 18:43:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2021 14:23:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-23"}

This naturally prevents rational design of these systems for practical\ndevices. Here, we provide a systematic study of the nonlinear response of metal\nspheres under continuous wave illumination within a purely thermal model. We\ncharacterize the strong dependence of the temperature rise and overall\nthermo-optic nonlinear response on the particle size and permittivity, on the\noptical and thermal host properties, as well as on the thermo-derivatives of\nthese properties. This dependence on the non-intrinsic parameters explains why\nit is inappropriate to extract an intrinsic nonlinear coefficient from a\nspecific system. Despite the revealed complex multi-parameter dependence, we\nmanaged to uncover a rather simple behaviour of the nonlinear response. In\nparticular, we show that the nonlinearity coefficients exhibit a dependence on\nthe illumination intensity which mimics the dependence of the temperature\nitself on the illumination intensity, namely, it grows for small nanoparticle\nsizes, reaches a maximum and then decreases monotonically for larger\nnanoparticles. The improved modelling allows us to demonstrate an overall\nnonlinear response which is about a 1000 times higher than in other strongly\nnonlinear systems (e.g., $\\epsilon$-near-zero systems); it also provides an\nexcellent match to experimental measurements of the scattering from a single\nmetal nanoparticles, thus, confirming the dominance of the thermal nonlinear\nmechanism.

For example, initial predictions\nbased on density-functional theory calculations of effective electron masses\nsuggested that the (111) surface of PbTe would produce very small MTEs ($\\leq$\n15 meV), whereas our experiments yielded MTEs ten to twenty times larger than\nthese predictions, and also exhibited a lower photoemission threshold than\npredicted.

To\nexplore this viewpoint, a sparse code is used to represent natural images in an\noptimal control task solved with neuro-dynamic programming, and its\ncomputational properties are investigated. The central finding is that when\nfeature inputs to a linear network are correlated, an over-complete sparse code\nincreases the memory capacity of the network in an efficient manner beyond that\npossible for any complete code with the same-sized input, and also increases\nthe speed of learning the network weights. A complete sparse code is found to\nmaximise the memory capacity of a linear network by decorrelating its feature\ninputs to transform the design matrix of the least-squares problem to one of\nfull rank. It also conditions the Hessian matrix of the least-squares problem,\nthereby increasing the rate of convergence to the optimal network weights.\nOther types of decorrelating codes would also achieve this. However, an\nover-complete sparse code is found to be approximately decorrelated, extracting\na larger number of approximately decorrelated features from the same-sized\ninput, allowing it to efficiently increase memory capacity beyond that possible\nfor any complete code: a 2.25 times over-complete sparse code is shown to at\nleast double memory capacity compared with a complete sparse code using the\nsame input.

Most recently proposed deep-learning-based image compression\nmethods leverage the auto-encoder structure, and reach a series of promising\nresults in this field. The images are encoded into low dimensional latent\nfeatures first, and entropy coded subsequently by exploiting the statistical\nredundancy. However, the information lost during encoding is unfortunately\ninevitable, which poses a significant challenge to the decoder to reconstruct\nthe original images. In this work, we propose a novel invertible framework\ncalled Invertible Lossy Compression (ILC) to largely mitigate the information\nloss problem. Specifically, ILC introduces an invertible encoding module to\nreplace the encoder-decoder structure to produce the low dimensional\ninformative latent representation, meanwhile, transform the lost information\ninto an auxiliary latent variable that won't be further coded or stored. The\nlatent representation is quantized and encoded into bit-stream, and the latent\nvariable is forced to follow a specified distribution, i.e. isotropic Gaussian\ndistribution. In this way, recovering the original image is made tractable by\neasily drawing a surrogate latent variable and applying the inverse pass of the\nmodule with the sampled variable and decoded latent features. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that with a new component replacing the auto-encoder in\nimage compression methods, ILC can significantly outperform the baseline method\non extensive benchmark datasets by combining with the existing compression\nalgorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2020 04:04:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2020 08:49:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 8 Jul 2020 01:55:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-09"}

Node importance estimation is a crucial and challenging task that\ncan benefit a lot of applications including recommendation, search, and query\ndisambiguation. A key challenge towards this goal is how to effectively use\ninput from different sources. On the one hand, a KG is a rich source of\ninformation, with multiple types of nodes and edges. On the other hand, there\nare external input signals, such as the number of votes or pageviews, which can\ndirectly tell us about the importance of entities in a KG. While several\nmethods have been developed to tackle this problem, their use of these external\nsignals has been limited as they are not designed to consider multiple signals\nsimultaneously. In this paper, we develop an end-to-end model MultiImport,\nwhich infers latent node importance from multiple, potentially overlapping,\ninput signals. MultiImport is a latent variable model that captures the\nrelation between node importance and input signals, and effectively learns from\nmultiple signals with potential conflicts. Also, MultiImport provides an\neffective estimator based on attentive graph neural networks.

One effective strategy to manage the privacy budget is to compute a\none-time private synopsis of the data, to which users can make an unlimited\nnumber of queries. However, existing systems using synopses are built for\noffline use cases, where a set of queries is known ahead of time and the system\ncarefully optimizes a synopsis for it. The synopses that these systems build\nare costly to compute and may also be costly to store.\n  We introduce Overlook, a system that enables private data exploration at\ninteractive latencies for both data analysts and data curators. The key idea in\nOverlook is a virtual synopsis that can be evaluated incrementally, without\nextra space storage or expensive precomputation. Overlook simply executes\nqueries using an existing engine, such as a SQL DBMS, and adds noise to their\nresults. Because Overlook's synopses do not require costly precomputation or\nstorage, data curators can also use Overlook to explore the impact of privacy\nparameters interactively. Overlook offers a rich visual query interface based\non the open source Hillview system. Overlook achieves accuracy comparable to\nexisting synopsis-based systems, while offering better performance and removing\nthe need for extra storage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2020 05:56:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-23"}

In particular, the approach is able to use sparser connectivity\nto embed several practical problems on quantum devices than other common\npractices. However, designing the driver Hamiltonians that successfully commute\nwith several constraints has largely been based on strong intuition for\nspecific problems and with no simple general algorithm to generate them for\narbitrary constraints.

This is a common scenario in many service\nsystems such as a bank, lunch at a cafeteria, music concert, flight check-in\nand many others. High demand for service at a specific time leads to congestion\nthat comes at a cost, e.g., for waiting, earliness or tardiness. Queueing\nTheory provides tools for the analysis of the waiting times and associated\ncosts. If customers have the option of deciding when to join the queue, they\nwill face a decision dilemma of when to arrive. The level of congestion one\nsuffers from depends on others behavior and not only that of the individual\nunder consideration. This fact leads customers to make strategic decisions\nregarding their time of arrival. In addition, multiple decision makers that\naffect each other's expected congestion, call for non-cooperative game\ntheoretic analysis of this strategic interaction. This common daily scenario\nhas prompted a research stream pioneered by the ?/M/1 model of Glazer and\nHassin (GH1983) that first characterized an arrival process to a queue as a\nNash equilibrium solution of a game. This survey provides an overview of the\nmain results and developments in the literature on queueing systems with\nstrategic timing of arrivals.

Our aggregation technique admits two useful\ninterpretations: it may be seen as a mechanism related to attention layers in\nneural networks, or it may be seen as a scalable surrogate of a classical\noptimal transport-based kernel. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness\nof our approach on biological sequences, achieving state-of-the-art results for\nprotein fold recognition and detection of chromatin profiles tasks, and, as a\nproof of concept, we show promising results for processing natural language\nsequences. We provide an open-source implementation of our embedding that can\nbe used alone or as a module in larger learning models at\nhttps://github.com/claying/OTK.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2020 08:35:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2020 18:10:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 2020 16:02:34 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2021 21:24:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-11"}

Nevertheless, common approaches mostly focus\non eliminating less important filters or constructing efficient operations,\nwhile ignoring the pattern redundancy in feature maps. We reveal that many\nfeature maps within a layer share similar but not identical patterns. However,\nit is difficult to identify if features with similar patterns are redundant or\ncontain essential details. Therefore, instead of directly removing uncertain\nredundant features, we propose a \\textbf{sp}lit based \\textbf{conv}olutional\noperation, namely SPConv, to tolerate features with similar patterns but\nrequire less computation. Specifically, we split input feature maps into the\nrepresentative part and the uncertain redundant part, where intrinsic\ninformation is extracted from the representative part through relatively heavy\ncomputation while tiny hidden details in the uncertain redundant part are\nprocessed with some light-weight operation. To recalibrate and fuse these two\ngroups of processed features, we propose a parameters-free feature fusion\nmodule. Moreover, our SPConv is formulated to replace the vanilla convolution\nin a plug-and-play way. Without any bells and whistles, experimental results on\nbenchmarks demonstrate SPConv-equipped networks consistently outperform\nstate-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and inference time on GPU, with\nFLOPs and parameters dropped sharply.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2020 09:08:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-23"}

Privacy-preserving data synthesis enables the data holder to\noutsource analytical tasks to an untrusted third party. The state-of-the-art\napproach for this problem is to build a generative model under differential\nprivacy, which offers a rigorous privacy guarantee. However, the existing\nmethod cannot adequately handle high dimensional data. In particular, when the\ninput dataset contains a large number of features, the existing techniques\nrequire injecting a prohibitive amount of noise to satisfy differential\nprivacy, which results in the outsourced data analysis meaningless. To address\nthe above issue, this paper proposes privacy-preserving phased generative model\n(P3GM), which is a differentially private generative model for releasing such\nsensitive data. P3GM employs the two-phase learning process to make it robust\nagainst the noise, and to increase learning efficiency (e.g., easy to\nconverge). We give theoretical analyses about the learning complexity and\nprivacy loss in P3GM. We further experimentally evaluate our proposed method\nand demonstrate that P3GM significantly outperforms existing solutions.\nCompared with the state-of-the-art methods, our generated samples look fewer\nnoises and closer to the original data in terms of data diversity.

Non-Volatile Memory (NVM) devices, such as Phase\nChange Memory and Spin-Transfer Torque RAM, are suitable candidates for main\nmemory to reduce energy consumption. But unlike DRAM, NVMs access latencies are\nhigher than DRAM and NVM writes are more energy sensitive than DRAM write\noperations. Thus, Hybrid Main Memory Systems (HMMS) employing DRAM and NVM have\nbeen proposed to reduce the overall energy depletion of main memory while\noptimizing the performance of NVM. This paper proposes eMap, an optimal heap\nmemory object placement planner in HMMS. eMap considers the object-level access\npatterns and energy consumption at the application level and provides an ideal\nplacement strategy for each object to augment performance and energy\nutilization. eMap is equipped with two modules, eMPlan and eMDyn. Specifically,\neMPlan is a static placement planner which provides one time placement policies\nfor memory object to meet the energy budget while eMDyn is a runtime placement\nplanner to consider the change in energy limiting constraint during the runtime\nand shuffles the memory objects by taking into account the access patterns as\nwell as the migration cost in terms of energy and performance.

In such settings, the agent\nneeds to behave safely not only after but also while learning. To achieve this,\nexisting safe reinforcement learning methods make an agent rely on priors that\nlet it avoid dangerous situations during exploration with high probability, but\nboth the probabilistic guarantees and the smoothness assumptions inherent in\nthe priors are not viable in many scenarios of interest such as autonomous\ndriving. This paper presents an alternative approach inspired by human\nteaching, where an agent learns under the supervision of an automatic\ninstructor that saves the agent from violating constraints during learning. In\nthis model, we introduce the monitor that neither needs to know how to do well\nat the task the agent is learning nor needs to know how the environment works.\nInstead, it has a library of reset controllers that it activates when the agent\nstarts behaving dangerously, preventing it from doing damage.

A common limitation of most existing pruning\ntechniques, is that they require pre-training of the network at least once\nbefore pruning, and thus we can benefit from reduction in memory and\ncomputation only at the inference time. However, reducing the training cost of\nneural networks with rapid structural pruning may be beneficial either to\nminimize monetary cost with cloud computing or to enable on-device learning on\na resource-limited device. Recently introduced random-weight pruning approaches\ncan eliminate the needs of pretraining, but they often obtain suboptimal\nperformance over conventional pruning techniques and also does not allow for\nfaster training since they perform unstructured pruning. To overcome their\nlimitations, we propose Set-based Task-Adaptive Meta Pruning (STAMP), which\ntask-adaptively prunes a network pretrained on a large reference dataset by\ngenerating a pruning mask on it as a function of the target dataset. To ensure\nmaximum performance improvements on the target task, we meta-learn the mask\ngenerator over different subsets of the reference dataset, such that it can\ngeneralize well to any unseen datasets within a few gradient steps of training.\nWe validate STAMP against recent advanced pruning methods on benchmark\ndatasets, on which it not only obtains significantly improved compression rates\nover the baselines at similar accuracy, but also orders of magnitude faster\ntraining speed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2020 10:57:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-23"}

Originally conceived in the file system context, range locks are\ngaining increasing interest in the Linux kernel community seeking to alleviate\nbottlenecks in the virtual memory management subsystem. The existing\nimplementation of range locks in the kernel, however, uses an internal spin\nlock to protect the underlying tree structure that keeps track of acquired and\nrequested ranges. This spin lock becomes a point of contention on its own when\nthe range lock is frequently acquired. Furthermore, where and exactly how\nspecific (refined) ranges can be locked remains an open question.\n  In this paper, we make two independent, but related contributions. First, we\npropose an alternative approach for building range locks based on linked lists.\nThe lists are easy to maintain in a lock-less fashion, and in fact, our range\nlocks do not use any internal locks in the common case. Second, we show how the\nrange of the lock can be refined in the mprotect operation through a\nspeculative mechanism. This refinement, in turn, allows concurrent execution of\nmprotect operations on non-overlapping memory regions.

In particular, layout-to-image\ngeneration models have gained significant attention due to their capability to\ngenerate realistic complex images containing distinct objects. These models are\ngenerally conditioned on either semantic layouts or textual descriptions.\nHowever, unlike natural images, providing auxiliary information can be\nextremely hard in domains such as biomedical imaging and remote sensing. In\nthis work, we propose a multi-object generation framework that can synthesize\nimages with multiple objects without explicitly requiring their contextual\ninformation during the generation process. Based on a vector-quantized\nvariational autoencoder (VQ-VAE) backbone, our model learns to preserve spatial\ncoherency within an image as well as semantic coherency between the objects and\nthe background through two powerful autoregressive priors: PixelSNAIL and\nLayoutPixelSNAIL. While the PixelSNAIL learns the distribution of the latent\nencodings of the VQ-VAE, the LayoutPixelSNAIL is used to specifically learn the\nsemantic distribution of the objects. An implicit advantage of our approach is\nthat the generated samples are accompanied by object-level annotations. We\ndemonstrate how coherency and fidelity are preserved with our method through\nexperiments on the Multi-MNIST and CLEVR datasets; thereby outperforming\nstate-of-the-art multi-object generative methods. The efficacy of our approach\nis demonstrated through application on medical imaging datasets, where we show\nthat augmenting the training set with generated samples using our approach\nimproves the performance of existing models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2020 11:33:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Jun 2020 10:20:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 15 Jul 2021 21:42:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-19"}

A turbulent flow over\na backward-facing step at Re = 28275 is considered to illustrate the potential\nof the approach. The data-assimilation procedure, based on a variational\napproach, consists in correcting a given baseline model by tuning\nspace-dependent source terms such that the corresponding solution matches\navailable measurements (obtained here from direct-numerical simulations). The\nbaseline model chosen here consists in Reynolds-Averaged-Navier-Stokes (RANS)\nequations closed with the turbulence Spalart-Allmaras model. We investigate two\npossible tuning functions: a source term in the momentum equations, which is\nable to compensate for the deficiencies in the modeling of the Reynolds\nstresses by the Boussinesq approximation and a source term in the turbulence\nequation, which modifies the balance between the eddy-viscosity production and\ndissipation. The quality of the mean-flow reconstruction strongly depends on\nthe baseline model and on the quantity of measurements. In the case of many\nmeasurements, very accurate reconstructions of the mean-flow are obtained with\nthe model corrected by the source term in the momentum equations, while the\nreconstruction is more approximate when tuning the source term in the\nturbulence model. In the case of few measurements, this \"rigidity\" of the\ncorrected turbulence model is favourably used and allows the best mean-flow\nreconstruction. The flexibility / rigidity of a model is further discussed in\nthe light of a singular-value decomposition of the linear input / output\noperator between source term and measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2020 11:35:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-23"}

The future of systematic reviewing will be an\ninteraction with machine learning algorithms to deal with the enormous increase\nof available text. We therefore developed an open source machine learning-aided\npipeline applying active learning: ASReview. We demonstrate by means of\nsimulation studies that ASReview can yield far more efficient reviewing than\nmanual reviewing, while providing high quality. Furthermore, we describe the\noptions of the free and open source research software and present the results\nfrom user experience tests. We invite the community to contribute to open\nsource projects such as our own that provide measurable and reproducible\nimprovements over current practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2020 11:57:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Oct 2020 07:00:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 2020 08:25:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-07"}

Thus, the fluid type and particle shape should be included in numerical\nmodels and experiments to assess the performance of microfluidics for targeted\ncell (e.g., CTCs) harvesting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2020 13:09:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-23"}

All\nfilms respond to the stimulus of temperature and films casted on\nmicrostructured silicon substrates with a native SiO2 layer show the highest\nthermoresponsiveness presumably because they adopt a more favorable structure.\nMicrostructuring provides a large specific area that extends the contact of\nPNIPAM chains with water molecules according to the Wenzel model, and thus\nincreasing the film thermoresponsiveness, resulting in a reversible transition\nfrom hydrophilicity to hydrophobicity upon heating. The absence of the native\nSiO2 layer from the silicon substrates affects the PS and PNIPAM arrangement in\nthe films, increasing the water contact angle both below and above the lower\ncritical solution temperature of PNIPAM and decreasing their\nthermoresponsiveness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2020 13:32:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-23"}

Here, we show that in the interior we\nhave Sobolev regularity for the stress and hardening while for their time\nderivatives we have the \"half\" derivative with the spatial and time variable.\nThis was well known for the limiting problem but we show that these estimates\nare uniform and independent of the order of approximation. The main novelty\nconsist of estimates near the boundary. We show that for the stress and the\nhardening parameter, we control tangential derivative in the Lebesgue\nspace~$L^2$, and for time derivative of the stress and the hardening we control\nthe \"half\" time derivative and also spatial tangential derivative. Last, for\nthe normal derivative, we show that the stress and the hardening have the $3/5$\nderivative with respect to the normal and for the time derivative of the stress\nand the hardening we show they have the $1/5$ derivative with respect to the\nnormal direction, provided we consider the kinematic hardening or near the\nDirichlet boundary.

Short-term forecasts (10-30 seconds into the future) of\ntraffic conditions are critical for traffic operations applications (e.g.,\nadaptive signal control). But traffic forecasting tools in the literature deal\npredominantly with 3-5 minute aggregated data, where the typical signal cycle\nis on the order of 2 minutes.

The formulation allows us to capture both\nnonlinear dependencies between forecasting inputs and outputs but also allows\nus to capture dependencies among the inputs.

We provide an asymptotic guarantee\nof two types of minimum PRW estimators and formulate a central limit theorem\nfor max-sliced Wasserstein estimator under model misspecification.

Here we propose\nan approach using parallel runs of MCMC, variational, or mode-based inference\nto hit as many modes or separated regions as possible and then combine these\nusing Bayesian stacking, a scalable method for constructing a weighted average\nof distributions. The result from stacking efficiently samples from multimodal\nposterior distribution, minimizes cross validation prediction error, and\nrepresents the posterior uncertainty better than variational inference, but it\nis not necessarily equivalent, even asymptotically, to fully Bayesian\ninference. We present theoretical consistency with an example where the stacked\ninference approximates the true data generating process from the misspecified\nmodel and a non-mixing sampler, from which the predictive performance is better\nthan full Bayesian inference, hence the multimodality can be considered a\nblessing rather than a curse under model misspecification.

To this\nend, we propose Generative Sparse Detection Network (GSDN), a\nfully-convolutional single-shot sparse detection network that efficiently\ngenerates the support for object proposals. The key component of our model is a\ngenerative sparse tensor decoder, which uses a series of transposed\nconvolutions and pruning layers to expand the support of sparse tensors while\ndiscarding unlikely object centers to maintain minimal runtime and memory\nfootprint. GSDN can process unprecedentedly large-scale inputs with a single\nfully-convolutional feed-forward pass, thus does not require the heuristic\npost-processing stage that stitches results from sliding windows as other\nprevious methods have. We validate our approach on three 3D indoor datasets\nincluding the large-scale 3D indoor reconstruction dataset where our method\noutperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a relative improvement of 7.14%\nwhile being 3.78 times faster than the best prior work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2020 15:54:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-23"}

These methods paved the way for dealing with large-scale and\ntime-dynamic graphs. This work aims to provide an overview of early and modern\ngraph neural network based machine learning methods for node-level prediction\ntasks. Under the umbrella of taxonomies already established in the literature,\nwe explain the core concepts and provide detailed explanations for\nconvolutional methods that have had strong impact. In addition, we introduce\ncommon benchmarks and present selected applications from various areas.\nFinally, we discuss open problems for further research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2020 11:57:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-20"}

Now there are grey models established with\ncontinuous fractional-order calculus method, and they have achieved good\nresults. However, the models are very complicated in the calculation and are\nnot conducive to the actual application. In order to further simplify and\nimprove the grey prediction models with continuous fractional-order derivative,\nwe propose a simple and effective grey model based on conformable fractional\nderivatives in this paper, and two practical cases are used to demonstrate the\nvalidity of the proposed model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2020 09:46:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 14 Aug 2020 01:51:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-28"}
