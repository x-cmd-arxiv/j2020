In this paper we report on optical and X-ray variability of the\nsystem. XMMU J010331.7-730144 has been monitored with the Optical Gravitational\nLensing Experiment (OGLE) in the I and V-bands for the past 9 years where it\nhas shown extremely large amplitude outbursts separated by long periods of\nlow-level flux.

The OGLE colour-magnitude diagrams also exhibit a distinct loop\nwhich is explained by changes in mass-loss from the Be star and mass outflow in\nits disc.

The focus is centred on the\nperformance of representative statistical and machine learning algorithms in\npredicting the outcome of laser processing on a range of materials. Results on\nexperimental data showed that predictive models were able to satisfactorily\nlearn the mapping between the laser input variables and the observed material\nstructure. These results are further integrated with simulation data aiming to\nelucidate the multiscale physical processes upon laser-material interaction. As\na consequence, we augmented the adjusted simulated data to the experimental and\nsubstantially improved the predictive performance, due to the availability of\nincreased number of sampling points. In parallel, a metric to identify and\nquantify the regions with high predictive uncertainty, is presented, revealing\nthat high uncertainty occurs around the transition boundaries. Our results can\nset the basis for a systematic methodology towards reducing material design,\ntesting and production cost via the replacement of expensive trial-and-error\nbased manufacturing procedure with a precise pre-fabrication predictive tool.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Jun 2020 17:28:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-11"}

Additionally, the computational complexity of each\niteration of our algorithm is on par with other state of the art algorithms,\nallowing us to quickly find solutions to the rank minimization problem for\nlarge matrices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Jun 2020 19:04:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 28 Mar 2021 22:15:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-30"}

To\nthis end we continue our exploration of statistical data assimilation (SDA) to\nidentify solutions to a small-scale model of neutrino flavor transformation.\nSDA is a machine learning (ML) formula wherein a dynamical model is assumed to\ngenerate any measured quantities. Specifically, we use an optimization\nformulation of SDA wherein a cost function is extremized via the variational\nmethod. Regions of state space in which the extremization identifies the global\nminimum of the cost function will correspond to parameter regimes in which a\nmodel solution can exist. Our example study seeks to infer the flavor\ntransformation histories of two mono-energetic neutrino beams coherently\ninteracting with each other and with a matter background. We require that the\nsolution be consistent with measured neutrino flavor fluxes at the point of\ndetection, and with constraints placed upon the flavor content at various\nlocations along their trajectories, such as the point of emission, and the\nlocations of the Mikheyev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein (MSW) resonances.

Furthermore, given the type of\nstudy or the project the resolution analysis interval can vary from less than\none hour to annual. To create alternatives in database structures,this article\naims to present a method to reconstruct disaggregated historical data from\naggregated data using Wavelet Transform. From the proposed method, it is\npossible to reconstruct data in short intervals from data with longer\nintervals,since they have the same behavior, for example, data from the same or\nsimilar highway. For such, a Detail coefficient is generated through the\nDiscrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) with the disaggregated data. The aggregated\ndata was reconstructed through an Approximation coefficient. After establishing\nthese coefficients, the Inverse Wavelet Transform (IWT) is applied. The results\nindicated an average correlation between the reconstructed the original data of\n0.960; 0.974; 0.968 and 0.960 for data initially aggregated at 10, 20, 40 and\n80 minutes interval, respectively.

Due to the\ngreat importance and popular use of support vector machines (SVM), we consider\ndefending SVM against poisoning attacks in this paper. We study two commonly\nused strategies for defending: designing robust SVM algorithms and data\nsanitization. Though several robust SVM algorithms have been proposed before,\nmost of them either are in lack of adversarial-resilience, or rely on strong\nassumptions about the data distribution or the attacker's behavior. Moreover,\nthe research on their complexities is still quite limited. We are the first, to\nthe best of our knowledge, to prove that even the simplest hard-margin\none-class SVM with outliers problem is NP-complete, and has no fully PTAS\nunless P$=$NP (that means it is hard to achieve an even approximate algorithm).\nFor the data sanitization defense, we link it to the intrinsic dimensionality\nof data; in particular, we provide a sampling theorem in doubling metrics for\nexplaining the effectiveness of DBSCAN (as a density-based outlier removal\nmethod) for defending against poisoning attacks. In our empirical experiments,\nwe compare several defenses including the DBSCAN and robust SVM methods, and\ninvestigate the influences from the intrinsic dimensionality and data density\nto their performances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Jun 2020 01:19:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Sep 2020 02:30:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2020 12:46:48 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 16 Sep 2020 06:01:23 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sat, 20 Feb 2021 12:36:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-23"}

This study derives an ALP\nmodel and integrates the compiled results from molecular dynamics (MD)\nsimulations, scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy, and mercury\ninjection capillary pressure. The ALP model assumes viscous forces, capillary\nforces, and liquid slippage in tortuous, rough pore throats.

One solution to enhance the\nspectral efficiency of OFDM-IM is the employment of multiple distinguishable\nconstellations (modes) by also exploiting its null subcarriers for data\ntransmission.

In this scenario, marginal distribution alignment-based methods will\nbe vulnerable to negative transfer. To address this issue, we propose a novel\nunsupervised domain adaptation method, Deep Conditional Adaptation Network\n(DCAN), based on conditional distribution alignment of feature spaces. To be\nspecific, we reduce the domain discrepancy by minimizing the Conditional\nMaximum Mean Discrepancy between the conditional distributions of deep features\non the source and target domains, and extract the discriminant information from\ntarget domain by maximizing the mutual information between samples and the\nprediction labels.

Currently, the sequential design is widely used\nby designers in industries that deal with different domains and their\ncorresponding design objectives separately leading to a functional but not\nnecessarily an optimal result. Consequently, the need for a systematic and\nmulti-objective design methodology arises. A new conceptual design approach\nbased on a multi-criteria profile for mechatronic systems has been previously\npresented by the authors which uses a series of nonlinear fuzzy-based\naggregation functions to facilitate decision-making for design evaluation in\nthe presence of interacting criteria. Choquet fuzzy integrals are one of the\nmost expressive and reliable preference models used in decision theory for\nmulticriteria decision making. They perform a weighted aggregation by the means\nof fuzzy measures assigning a weight to any coalition of criteria.

We used optical photometric and\npolarimetric data obtained with the 1.5-m Kanata telescope for 2008-2014.

FSRQs are characterized by\nrare and large flares, while the variability of BL Lac objects can be\nreproduced with a stationary OU process with relatively small amplitudes. The\ncharacteristics of the variability are governed not by the differences in the\njet structure between the subtypes, but by the peak frequency of the\nsynchrotron emission. This implies that the nature of the variation in the jets\nis common in FSRQs and BL Lac objects.

We explore this empirically in this paper by studying\ntransferability of adversarial examples between linear 01 loss and convex\n(hinge) loss models, and between dual layer neural networks with sign\nactivation and 01 loss vs sigmoid activation and logistic loss. We first show\nthat white box adversarial examples do not transfer effectively between convex\nand 01 loss and between 01 loss models compared to between convex models. As a\nresult of this non-transferability we see that convex substitute model black\nbox attacks are less effective on 01 loss than convex models. Interestingly we\nalso see that 01 loss substitute model attacks are ineffective on both convex\nand 01 loss models mostly likely due to the non-uniqueness of 01 loss models.\nWe show intuitively by example how the presence of outliers can cause different\ndecision boundaries between 01 and convex loss models which in turn produces\nadversaries that are non-transferable. Indeed we see on MNIST that adversaries\ntransfer between 01 loss and convex models more easily than on CIFAR10 and\nImageNet which are likely to contain outliers. We show intuitively by example\nhow the non-continuity of 01 loss makes adversaries non-transferable in a dual\nlayer neural network.

To\nlearn an effective policy for the agent, it usually requires a huge amount of\ndata by interacting with the environment, which could be computational costly\nand time consuming. To overcome this challenge, the framework called\nReinforcement Learning with Expert Demonstrations (RLED) was proposed to\nexploit the supervision from expert demonstrations. Although the RLED methods\ncan reduce the number of learning iterations, they usually assume the\ndemonstrations are perfect, and thus may be seriously misled by the noisy\ndemonstrations in real applications. In this paper, we propose a novel\nframework to adaptively learn the policy by jointly interacting with the\nenvironment and exploiting the expert demonstrations. Specifically, for each\nstep of the demonstration trajectory, we form an instance, and define a joint\nloss function to simultaneously maximize the expected reward and minimize the\ndifference between agent behaviors and demonstrations. Most importantly, by\ncalculating the expected gain of the value function, we assign each instance\nwith a weight to estimate its potential utility, and thus can emphasize the\nmore helpful demonstrations while filter out noisy ones. Experimental results\nin various environments with multiple popular reinforcement learning algorithms\nshow that the proposed approach can learn robustly with noisy demonstrations,\nand achieve higher performance in fewer iterations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Jun 2020 06:03:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-16"}

This chapter systematically summarize the\ndetrimental factors as task-relevant/irrelevant semantic variations and\nunspecified latent variation. In this chapter, these problems are casted as\neither a deep metric learning problem or an adversarial minimax game in the\nlatent space. For the former choice, a generalized adaptive (N+M)-tuplet\nclusters loss function together with the identity-aware hard-negative mining\nand online positive mining scheme can be used for identity-invariant FER. The\nbetter FER performance can be achieved by combining the deep metric loss and\nsoftmax loss in a unified two fully connected layer branches framework via\njoint optimization. For the latter solution, it is possible to equipping an\nend-to-end conditional adversarial network with the ability to decompose an\ninput sample into three complementary parts.

This is a novel autoencoder whose\nlatent space verifies two properties. Firstly, the dimensions are organised in\ndecreasing importance with respect to the data at hand. Secondly, the\ncomponents of the latent space are statistically independent. We achieve this\nby progressively increasing the latent space during training, and with a\ncovariance loss applied to the latent codes. The resulting autoencoder produces\na latent space which separates the intrinsic attributes of the data into\ndifferent components of the latent space, in a completely unsupervised manner.\nWe also describe an extension of our approach to the case of powerful,\npre-trained GANs.

Thus, a natural question is raised: does\nlearning in a pairwise manner mitigate label noise? To give an affirmative\nanswer, in this paper, we propose a framework called Class2Simi: it transforms\ndata points with noisy class labels to data pairs with noisy similarity labels,\nwhere a similarity label denotes whether a pair shares the class label or not.\nThrough this transformation, the reduction of the noise rate is theoretically\nguaranteed, and hence it is in principle easier to handle noisy similarity\nlabels. Amazingly, DNNs that predict the clean class labels can be trained from\nnoisy data pairs if they are first pretrained from noisy data points.\nClass2Simi is computationally efficient because not only this transformation is\non-the-fly in mini-batches, but also it just changes loss computation on top of\nmodel prediction into a pairwise manner.

Most recent methods mine the object regions by expanding the seed\nregions localized by class activation maps. They generally do not consider the\nsizes of objects and apply a monotonous procedure to mining all the object\nregions. Thus their mined regions are often insufficient in number and scale\nfor large objects, and on the other hand easily contaminated by surrounding\nbackgrounds for small objects. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-miner\nframework to perform a region mining process that adapts to diverse object\nsizes and is thus able to mine more integral and finer object regions.\nSpecifically, our multi-miner leverages a parallel modulator to check whether\nthere are remaining object regions for each single object, and guide a\ncategory-aware generator to mine the regions of each object independently. In\nthis way, the multi-miner adaptively takes more steps for large objects and\nfewer steps for small objects.

In particular, we\npresent a novel training framework to jointly target both PU classification and\nconditional generation when exposing to extra data, especially\nout-of-distribution unlabeled data, by exploring the interplay between them: 1)\nenhancing the performance of PU classifiers with the assistance of a novel\nConditional Generative Adversarial Network~(CGAN) that is robust to noisy\nlabels, 2) leveraging extra data with predicted labels from a PU classifier to\nhelp the generation. Our key contribution is a Classifier-Noise-Invariant\nConditional GAN~(CNI-CGAN) that can learn the clean data distribution from\nnoisy labels predicted by a PU classifier. Theoretically, we proved the optimal\ncondition of CNI-CGAN and experimentally, we conducted extensive evaluations on\ndiverse datasets, verifying the simultaneous improvements on both\nclassification and generation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Jun 2020 08:27:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-16"}

For lightcurves of moderate length ($< 10^3$), a useful first\nanalysis is to test the Gaussianity of the flux and logarithm of the flux, by\nestimating the skewness and applying the Anderson-Darling (AD) method. We\nperform extensive simulations of lightcurves with different lengths,\nvariability, Gaussian measurement errors and power spectrum index $\\beta$ (i.e.\n$P(f) \\propto f^{-\\beta}$), to provide a prescriptionand guidelines for\nreliable use of these two tests.

This paper develops efficient\nalgorithms for (self-)repulsion of plane and space curves that are well-suited\nto problems in computational design. Our starting point is the so-called\ntangent-point energy, which provides an infinite barrier to self-intersection.\nIn contrast to local collision detection strategies used in, e.g., physical\nsimulation, this energy considers interactions between all pairs of points, and\nis hence useful for global shape optimization: local minima tend to be\naesthetically pleasing, physically valid, and nicely distributed in space. A\nreformulation of gradient descent, based on a Sobolev-Slobodeckij inner product\nenables us to make rapid progress toward local minima---independent of curve\nresolution. We also develop a hierarchical multigrid scheme that significantly\nreduces the per-step cost of optimization. The energy is easily integrated with\na variety of constraints and penalties (e.g., inextensibility, or obstacle\navoidance), which we use for applications including curve packing, knot\nuntangling, graph embedding, non-crossing spline interpolation, flow\nvisualization, and robotic path planning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Jun 2020 10:26:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-16"}

Indeed, star-planet tidal interactions\ngenerate exchanges of angular momentum that can results in tidal spin-up. This\neffect could then lead to gyrochronological ages biased towards younger ages.\nAims. This article provides the community with TATOO, a standalone tool based\non tidal-chronology, to estimate the age of a massive close-in planetary system\nby only using its observed properties: mass of the planet and the star, stellar\nrotational and planetary orbital periods. I used the numerical code described\nin Gallet et al. (2018) to create a large multi-parametric grid of synthetic\nstar-planet systems evolution, and 3D interpolation method to provide a fairly\nprecise age estimate, using tidal-chronology technique, of any given planetary\nsystems composed of at least of one massive close-in planet. About half of the\nplanetary systems investigated in this work are subject to tidal spin-up bias.\nI pointed out that this bias linearly scales with the ratio between rotation to\norbital period, making this quantity a useful proxy to rapidly investigate the\nneed to use tidal-chronology. Moreover, while being model dependent, TATOO can\nalso be used even if no rotational departure is present. In that case, it gives\nresults in agreement with the classical gyrochronological analysis. TATOO is a\nuseful tool specifically designed for massive close-in planetary systems that\ncan also be used as a classical gyrochronological tool. For now it is the only\npublicly available software to estimate the age of massive close-in planetary\nsystems subject to tidal spin-up. In that sense, tidal-chronology can be seen\nas a first order correction of the impact of tidal interaction on\ngyrochronology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Jun 2020 12:25:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 12 Jul 2020 16:21:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-09"}

Methods: A diffusion-$T_1$ correlation\nexperiment was carried out on an in vivo human brain using tensor-valued\ndiffusion encoding and multiple repetition times. The acquired data was\ninverted using a Monte-Carlo inversion algorithm that retrieves non-parametric\ndistributions $\\mathcal{P}(\\mathbf{D},R_1)$ of diffusion tensors and\nlongitudinal relaxation rates $R_1 = 1/T_1$.

Further analyses demonstrate that atomic dipoles in the 2D\nmonolayers induced by the electronegativity difference enhance the corrugation\nof charge distribution and increase the sliding barrier accordingly. Our\nstudies reveal that electronegativity plays an important role in friction of\nlow dimensional systems, and will provide a strategy for designing nanoscale\ndevices further.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Jun 2020 14:20:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-16"}

It allows\nphysicians (for example) to identify groups of patients for whom a given drug\nor treatment is likely to be effective and groups of patients for which it is\nnot. Most of the current methods of subgroup analysis begin with a particular\nalgorithm for estimating individualized treatment effects (ITE) and identify\nsubgroups by maximizing the difference across subgroups of the average\ntreatment effect in each subgroup. These approaches have several weaknesses:\nthey rely on a particular algorithm for estimating ITE, they ignore\n(in)homogeneity within identified subgroups, and they do not produce good\nconfidence estimates. This paper develops a new method for subgroup analysis,\nR2P, that addresses all these weaknesses. R2P uses an arbitrary, exogenously\nprescribed algorithm for estimating ITE and quantifies the uncertainty of the\nITE estimation, using a construction that is more robust than other methods.\nExperiments using synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets (based on real data)\ndemonstrate that R2P constructs partitions that are simultaneously more\nhomogeneous within groups and more heterogeneous across groups than the\npartitions produced by other methods. Moreover, because R2P can employ any ITE\nestimator, it also produces much narrower confidence intervals with a\nprescribed coverage guarantee than other methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Jun 2020 14:50:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 18 Oct 2020 03:00:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-20"}

As such, dynamic pricing\nmethods have been used to mediate these demand asymmetries through surge price\nmultipliers, thus incentivising higher driver participation in the market.\nHowever, the anticipated commercialisation of autonomous vehicles could\ntransform the current ride-sourcing platforms to fleet operators. The absence\nof human drivers fosters the need for empty vehicle management to address any\nvehicle supply deficiencies. Proactive redistribution using integer programming\nand demand predictive models have been proposed in research to address this\nproblem. A shortcoming of existing models, however, is that they ignore the\nmarket structure and underlying customer choice behaviour. As such, current\nmodels do not capture the real value of redistribution. To resolve this, we\nformulate the vehicle redistribution problem as a non-linear minimum cost flow\nproblem which accounts for the relationship of supply and demand of rides, by\nassuming a customer discrete choice model and a market structure. We\ndemonstrate that this model can have a convex domain, and we introduce an edge\nsplitting algorithm to solve a transformed convex minimum cost flow problem for\nvehicle redistribution. By testing our model using simulation, we show that our\nredistribution algorithm can decrease wait times by more than 50%, increase\nprofit up to 10% with less than 20% increase in vehicle mileage. Our findings\noutline that the value of redistribution is contingent on localised market\nstructure and customer behaviour.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Jun 2020 14:52:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Dec 2020 18:20:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-29"}

We present a hybrid\ntime-dependent numerical renormalization group approach which combines an\naccurate numerical renormalization group treatment of the non-equilibrium\ndynamics on the finite size Wilson chain with a Bloch-Redfield formalism to\ninclude the effect of these additional reservoirs. Our approach overcomes the\nintrinsic shortcoming of the time-dependent numerical renormalization group\napproach induced by the bath discretization with a Wilson parameter $\\Lambda >\n1$.

Recently one-stage methods have gained much attention over\ntwo-stage approaches due to their simpler design and competitive performance.\nHere we propose a fully convolutional one-stage object detector (FCOS) to solve\nobject detection in a per-pixel prediction fashion, analogue to other dense\nprediction problems such as semantic segmentation. Almost all state-of-the-art\nobject detectors such as RetinaNet, SSD, YOLOv3, and Faster R-CNN rely on\npre-defined anchor boxes. In contrast, our proposed detector FCOS is anchor box\nfree, as well as proposal free. By eliminating the pre-defined set of anchor\nboxes, FCOS completely avoids the complicated computation related to anchor\nboxes such as calculating the intersection over union (IoU) scores during\ntraining. More importantly, we also avoid all hyper-parameters related to\nanchor boxes, which are often sensitive to the final detection performance.\nWith the only post-processing non-maximum suppression (NMS), we demonstrate a\nmuch simpler and flexible detection framework achieving improved detection\naccuracy. We hope that the proposed FCOS framework can serve as a simple and\nstrong alternative for many other instance-level tasks.

When facing multiple views that are highly\nrelated but sightly different from each other, most of existing multi-view\nmethods might fail to fully integrate multi-view information. Besides,\ncorrelations between features from multiple views always vary seriously, which\nmakes multi-view representation challenging. Therefore, how to learn\nappropriate embedding from multi-view information is still an open problem but\nchallenging. To handle this issue, this paper proposes a novel multi-view\nlearning method, named Multi-view Low-rank Preserving Embedding (MvLPE). It\nintegrates different views into one centroid view by minimizing the\ndisagreement term, based on distance or similarity matrix among instances,\nbetween the centroid view and each view meanwhile maintaining low-rank\nreconstruction relations among samples for each view, which could make more\nfull use of compatible and complementary information from multi-view features.\nUnlike existing methods with additive parameters, the proposed method could\nautomatically allocate a suitable weight for each view in multi-view\ninformation fusion. However, MvLPE couldn't be directly solved, which makes the\nproposed MvLPE difficult to obtain an analytic solution. To this end, we\napproximate this solution based on stationary hypothesis and normalization\npost-processing to efficiently obtain the optimal solution. Furthermore, an\niterative alternating strategy is provided to solve this multi-view\nrepresentation problem. The experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate\nthat the proposed method outperforms its counterparts while achieving very\ncompetitive performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Jun 2020 12:47:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-20"}

Deep neural networks (DNNs) provide a promising candidate for such a\nmodel. However, DNNs require orders of magnitude more training data than\nneuroscientists can collect from real neurons because experimental recording\ntime is severely limited. This motivates us to find images that train\nhighly-predictive DNNs with as little training data as possible. We propose\ngaudy images---high-contrast binarized versions of natural images---to\nefficiently train DNNs. In extensive simulation experiments, we find that\ntraining DNNs with gaudy images substantially reduces the number of training\nimages needed to accurately predict the simulated responses of visual cortical\nneurons. We also find that gaudy images, chosen before training, outperform\nimages chosen during training by active learning algorithms. Thus, gaudy images\noveremphasize features of natural images, especially edges, that are the most\nimportant for efficiently training DNNs.

The paradox is that two ships, starting\nfrom the same reference frame and subject to the same acceleration, would snap\na string that connected them, even as their separation distance would not\nchange as measured from the original reference frame. This paper uses a Simple\nRelativity approach to resolve the paradox and explain both why the string\nsnaps, and how to adjust accelerations to avoid snapping the string. In doing\nso, an interesting parallel understanding of the Lorentz contraction is\ngenerated. The solution is applied to rotation to address the Ehrenfest paradox\nand orbital precession as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Jun 2020 16:07:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-09"}
