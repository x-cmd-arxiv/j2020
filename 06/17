Drawing\non the statistical physics notion of ``density of states,'' the DoSE decision\nrule avoids direct comparison of model probabilities, and instead utilizes the\n``probability of the model probability,'' or indeed the frequency of any\nreasonable statistic. The frequency is calculated using nonparametric density\nestimators (e.g., KDE and one-class SVM) which measure the typicality of\nvarious model statistics given the training data and from which we can flag\ntest points with low typicality as anomalous. Unlike many other methods, DoSE\nrequires neither labeled data nor OOD examples. DoSE is modular and can be\ntrivially applied to any existing, trained model.

We introduce a general method for quantifying competition\nbetween linguistic elements in diachronic corpora which does not require\nlanguage-specific resources other than a sufficiently large corpus. This\napproach is readily applicable to a wide range of languages and linguistic\nsubsystems. Here, we apply it to lexical data in five corpora differing in\nlanguage, type, genre, and time span. We find that changes in communicative\nneed are consistently predictive of lexical competition dynamics.\nNear-synonymous words are more likely to directly compete if they belong to a\ntopic of conversation whose importance to language users is constant over time,\npossibly leading to the extinction of one of the competing words. By contrast,\nin topics which are increasing in importance for language users,\nnear-synonymous words tend not to compete directly and can coexist.

Using high\ncapacity AE often leads to a large collection of minimizers, many of which\nrepresent a low dimensional manifold that fits the data well but generalizes\npoorly.\n  Two sources of bad generalization are: extrinsic, where the learned manifold\npossesses extraneous parts that are far from the data; and intrinsic, where the\nencoder and decoder introduce arbitrary distortion in the low dimensional\nparameterization. An approach taken to alleviate these issues is to add a\nregularizer that favors a particular solution; common regularizers promote\nsparsity, small derivatives, or robustness to noise.\n  In this paper, we advocate an isometry (i.e., local distance preserving)\nregularizer. Specifically, our regularizer encourages: (i) the decoder to be an\nisometry; and (ii) the encoder to be the decoder's pseudo-inverse, that is, the\nencoder extends the inverse of the decoder to the ambient space by orthogonal\nprojection.

We describe such decay by proposing a\nprecise large deviation principle under the assumption that the subexponential\ncorrection term to the waiting time distribution is regularly varying. This\nprinciple is in particular used to characterize the fluctuations of the number\nof renewals, which measures the DNA-bound monomers in the Poland-Scheraga\nmodel, the particles in the Fisher-Felderhof model and the Tokar-Dreyss\\'e\nmodel, and the native peptide bonds in the Wako-Sait\\^o-Mu\\~noz-Eaton model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jun 2020 16:39:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Mar 2021 20:52:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-24"}

It is designed to handle every\npossible combination of periodic, symmetric, semi-unbounded and fully unbounded\nboundary conditions for the Poisson equation on rectangular domains with\nuniform resolution. FLUPS leverages a dedicated implementation of 3D Fourier\ntransforms to solve the Poisson equation using Green's functions, in a fast and\nmemory-efficient way. Several Green's functions are available, optionally with\nexplicit regularization, spectral truncation, or using lattice Green's\nfunctions, and provide verified convergence orders from 2 to spectral-like. The\nalgorithm depends on the FFTW library to perform 1D transforms, while Message\nPassing Interface (MPI) communications enable the required remapping of data in\nmemory. For the latter operation, a first available implementation resorts to\nthe standard all-to-all routines. A second implementation, featuring\nnon-blocking and persistent point-to-point communications, is however shown to\nbe more efficient in a majority of cases and especially while taking advantage\nof the shared memory parallelism with OpenMP. The scalability of the algorithm,\naimed at massively parallel architectures, is demonstrated up to 73 720 cores.\nThe results obtained with three different supercomputers show that the weak\nefficiency remains above 40\\% and the strong efficiency above 30% when the\nnumber of cores is multiplied by 16, for typical problems.

Traditional methods usually inject the extracted\nhigh-frequency details from PAN into the up-sampled MSI. Recent deep learning\nendeavors are mostly supervised assuming the HR MSI is available, which is\nunrealistic especially for satellite images. Nonetheless, these methods could\nnot fully exploit the rich spectral characteristics in the MSI. Due to the wide\nexistence of mixed pixels in satellite images where each pixel tends to cover\nmore than one constituent material, pansharpening at the subpixel level becomes\nessential. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised pansharpening (UP) method\nin a deep-learning framework to address the above challenges based on the\nself-attention mechanism (SAM), referred to as UP-SAM. The contribution of this\npaper is three-fold. First, the self-attention mechanism is proposed where the\nspatial varying detail extraction and injection functions are estimated\naccording to the attention representations indicating spectral characteristics\nof the MSI with sub-pixel accuracy. Second, such attention representations are\nderived from mixed pixels with the proposed stacked attention network powered\nwith a stick-breaking structure to meet the physical constraints of mixed pixel\nformulations. Third, the detail extraction and injection functions are spatial\nvarying based on the attention representations, which largely improves the\nreconstruction accuracy.

We understand such a\nresult by mapping the equations for dusty flow, in the limit of vanishing\ninertia, to a Newtonian flow with an effective forcing reduced by the increase\nin fluid density due to the presence of particles. We also discuss the negative\nfeedback produced by turbophoresis which mitigates the effects of particles,\nespecially with larger inertia, on the turbulent flow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jun 2020 17:15:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-13"}

In this work we propose the first image\ndecompression method to facilitate user-exploration of the diverse set of\nnatural images that could have given rise to the compressed input code, thus\ngranting users the ability to determine what could and what could not have been\nthere in the original scene. Specifically, we develop a novel deep-network\nbased decoder architecture for the ubiquitous JPEG standard, which allows\ntraversing the set of decompressed images that are consistent with the\ncompressed JPEG file. To allow for simple user interaction, we develop a\ngraphical user interface comprising several intuitive exploration tools,\nincluding an automatic tool for examining specific solutions of interest.

On long and\nintermediate timescales (relative to the dynamical timescale of the galaxy),\nthe PSD is typically set by the variability of the inflow rate and the\ninterplay between outflows and gas depletion. On short timescales, the PSD\nshows an additional component related to the life-cycle of molecular clouds,\nwhich can be described by a damped random walk with a power-law slope of\n$\\beta\\approx2$ at high frequencies with a break near the average cloud\nlifetime. We discuss star-formation \"burstiness\" in a wide range of galaxy\nregimes, study the evolution of galaxies about the main sequence ridgeline, and\nexplore the applicability of our method for understanding the star-formation\nprocess on cloud-scale from galaxy-integrated measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jun 2020 18:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 2020 14:07:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-08"}

The present paper aims\nat showing that, in addition to these modes established in the radiative\nenvelope, pure inertial modes, trapped in the convective core, can be detected\nin Kepler observations of gamma Doradus stars, thanks to their resonance with\nthe gravito-inertial modes.\n  We start by using a simplified model of perturbations in a full sphere of\nuniform density.

We then\ncompute coupling factors which help select the pure inertial modes which\ninteract best with the surrounding dipolar gravito-inertial modes. Using\ncomplete calculations of gravito-inertial modes in realistic models of gamma\nDoradus stars, we are able to show that the pure inertial/gravito-inertial\nresonances appear as dips in the gravito-inertial mode period spacing series at\nspin parameters close to those predicted by the simple model.

These methods assume that noise across pixels is\nstatistically independent, and the underlying image pixels show spatial\ncorrelations across neighborhoods.

Moving beyond diagnosis prediction, evaluation of disease\nmechanisms is critically important for biomedical research.

Moreover, users often ask questions that\ndiverge from the model's training data, making errors more likely and thus\nabstention more critical. In this work, we propose the setting of selective\nquestion answering under domain shift, in which a QA model is tested on a\nmixture of in-domain and out-of-domain data, and must answer (i.e., not abstain\non) as many questions as possible while maintaining high accuracy. Abstention\npolicies based solely on the model's softmax probabilities fare poorly, since\nmodels are overconfident on out-of-domain inputs. Instead, we train a\ncalibrator to identify inputs on which the QA model errs, and abstain when it\npredicts an error is likely.

In this\nwork, we study whether reflection is indeed absent or undetectable due to its\nintrinsically weak features together with the low statistics inherent to LLAGN.\nHere we focus on NGC 3718 ($L/L_{\\rm Edd}\\sim10^{-5}$) combining observations\nfrom XMM--Newton and the deepest to date NuSTAR (0.5--79 keV) spectrum of a\nLLAGN, to constrain potential reflectors, and analyze how the fitted coronal\nparameters depend on the reflection model. We test models representing both an\naccretion disc (Relxill) and a torus-like (MYTorus and Borus) neutral\nreflector. From a statistical point of view, reflection is not required, but\nits inclusion allows to place strong constraints on the geometry and physical\nfeatures of the surroundings: both neutral reflectors (torus) tested should be\nCompton thin ($N_H<10^{23.2}$cm$^{-2}$) and preferentially cover a large\nfraction of the sky.

These models produce an\nintrinsic power-law spectral index in the range [1.81--1.87], where the torus\nmodels result in steeper slopes. The cut-off energy of the power-law emission\nalso changes with the inclusion of reflection models, resulting in constrained\nvalues for the disc reflectors and unconstrained values for torus reflectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jun 2020 19:13:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-24"}

Previous\nstudies have linked tumor lobar presence and laterality to GBM outcomes,\nsuggesting that disease etiology and progression in GBM may be impacted by\ntumor location. Hence, in this feasibility study, we seek to investigate the\nfollowing question: Can tumor location on treatment-na\\\"ive MRI provide early\ncues regarding likelihood of a patient developing pseudo-progression versus\ntumor recurrence? In this study, 74 pre-treatment Glioblastoma MRI scans with\nPsP (33) and tumor recurrence (41) were analyzed. First, enhancing lesion on\nGd-T1w MRI and peri-lesional hyperintensities on T2w/FLAIR were segmented by\nexperts and then registered to a brain atlas. Using patients from the two\nphenotypes, we construct two atlases by quantifying frequency of occurrence of\nenhancing lesion and peri-lesion hyperintensities, by averaging voxel\nintensities across the population. Analysis of differential involvement was\nthen performed to compute voxel-wise significant differences (p-value<0.05)\nacross the atlases. Statistically significant clusters were finally mapped to a\nstructural atlas to provide anatomic localization of their location. Our\nresults demonstrate that patients with tumor recurrence showed prominence of\ntheir initial tumor in the parietal lobe, while patients with PsP showed a\nmulti-focal distribution of the initial tumor in the frontal and temporal\nlobes, insula, and putamen. These preliminary results suggest that\nlateralization of pre-treatment lesions towards certain anatomical areas of the\nbrain may allow to provide early cues regarding assessing likelihood of\noccurrence of pseudo-progression from tumor recurrence on MRI scans.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jun 2020 19:49:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-18"}

Here we show evidence that turbulence is in\nfact a key influence on both fall speed and spatial distribution of settling\nsnow. We consider three snowfall events under vastly different levels of\natmospheric turbulence. We characterize the size and morphology of the snow\nparticles, and we simultaneously image their velocity, acceleration, and\nrelative concentration over vertical planes about 30 m2 in area. We find that\nturbulence-driven settling enhancement explains otherwise contradictory trends\nbetween the particle size and velocity. The estimates of the Stokes number and\nthe correlation between vertical velocity and local concentration indicate that\nthe enhanced settling is rooted in the preferential sweeping mechanism. When\nthe snow vertical velocity is large compared to the characteristic turbulence\nvelocity, the crossing trajectories effect results in strong accelerations.\nWhen the conditions of preferential sweeping are met, the concentration field\nis highly non-uniform and clustering appears over a wide range of scales. These\nclusters, identified for the first time in a naturally occurring flow, display\nthe signature features seen in canonical settings: power-law size distribution,\nfractal-like shape, vertical elongation, and large fall speed that increases\nwith the cluster size. These findings demonstrate that the fundamental\nphenomenology of particle-laden turbulence can be leveraged towards a better\npredictive understanding of snow precipitation and ground snow accumulation.\nThey also demonstrate how environmental flows can be used to investigate\ndispersed multiphase flows at Reynolds numbers not accessible in laboratory\nexperiments or numerical simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jun 2020 20:29:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-24"}

Since humans tend to hold varying and even conflicting preferences, AI\nalgorithms responsible for making decisions on behalf of such groups encounter\nthe problem of preference aggregation: combining inconsistent and sometimes\ncontradictory individual preferences into a representative aggregate. In this\npaper, we address this problem in a real-world public health context: kidney\nexchange. The algorithms that allocate kidneys from living donors to patients\nneeding transplants in kidney exchange matching markets should prioritize\npatients in a way that aligns with the values of the community they serve, but\nallocation preferences vary widely across individuals. In this paper, we\npropose, implement and evaluate a methodology for prioritizing patients based\non such heterogeneous moral preferences. Instead of selecting a single static\nset of patient weights, we learn a distribution over preference functions based\non human subject responses to allocation dilemmas, then sample from this\ndistribution to dynamically determine patient weights during matching. We find\nthat this methodology increases the average rank of matched patients in the\nsampled preference ordering, indicating better satisfaction of group\npreferences.

Ground based observations have found that simultaneously observed SO2\nand H2O at ~64 km vary with time and are temporally anti-correlated. To\nunderstand these observations, we explore the sulfur-water chemical system\nusing a one-dimensional chemistry-diffusion model. We find that SO2 and H2O\nmixing ratios above the clouds are highly dependent on mixing ratios of the two\nspecies at the middle cloud top (58 km). The behavior of sulfur-water chemical\nsystem can be classified into three regimes but there is no abrupt transition\namong these regimes. In particular, there is no bifurcation behavior as\npreviously claimed. We also find that the SO2 self-shielding effect causes H2O\nabove the clouds to respond to the middle cloud top in a non-monotonic fashion.\nThrough comparison with observations, we find that mixing ratio variations at\nthe middle cloud top can explain the observed variability of SO2 and H2O. The\nsulfur-water chemistry in the middle atmosphere is responsible for the H2O-SO2\nanti-correlation at 64 km. Eddy transport change alone cannot explain the\nvariations of both species. These results imply that variations of species\nabundance in the middle atmosphere are significantly influenced by the lower\natmospheric processes.

A popular definition of FC is by\nstatistical associations between measured brain regions. However, this could be\nproblematic since the associations can only provide spatial connections but not\ncausal interactions among regions of interests. Hence, it is necessary to study\ntheir causal relationship. Directed acyclic graph (DAG) models have been\napplied in recent FC studies but often encountered problems such as limited\nsample sizes and large number of variables (namely high-dimensional problems),\nwhich lead to both computational difficulty and convergence issues. As a\nresult, the use of DAG models is problematic, where the identification of DAG\nmodels in general is nondeterministic polynomial time hard (NP-hard). To this\nend, we propose a $\\psi$-learning incorporated linear non-Gaussian acyclic\nmodel ($\\psi$-LiNGAM). We use the association model ($\\psi$-learning) to\nfacilitate causal inferences and the model works well especially for\nhigh-dimensional cases. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed\nmethod is more robust and accurate than several existing ones in detecting\ngraph structure and direction. We then applied it to the resting state fMRI\n(rsfMRI) data obtained from the publicly available Philadelphia\nNeurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC) to study the cognitive variance, which includes\n855 individuals aged 8-22 years.

In this\nstudy, we evaluate and quantify network resilience based both on the\nfunctionality states of links and on topology. We propose three independent\nmeasures---the failure scaling index (FSI), the weighted degree scaling index\n(WDSI), and the link functionality irregularity index (LFII)---that capture\nmacroscopic, microscopic, and temporal performance characteristics of networks.\nAccordingly, an integrated general resilience (GR) metric is used to assess\nperformance loss and recovery speed in networks with time-variant\nfunctionality.

Our results show that link\nweights and node weighted degrees with perturbed functionality in the traffic\nnetwork during flooding follow a scale-free distribution. Hence, three proposed\nmeasures capture clear resilience curves of the network as well as identify the\nirregularity of links.

Relatively small-scale downdrafts between\nupwelling columns over the substellar region are better resolved and the mixing\nbetween dry and wet air parcels and between anvil clouds and their environment\nare enhanced as the resolution is increased. These reduce atmospheric relative\nhumidity and high-level cloud fraction, causing a lower clear-sky greenhouse\neffect, a weaker cloud longwave radiation effect, and subsequently a cooler\nclimate with increasing model resolution. Overall, the sensitivity of the\nsimulated climate of tidally locked aquaplanets to model resolution is small.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jun 2020 00:55:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-12"}

In these phenomena, the mechanism of structural\ndamage depends on the wave propagation across the fluid-solid interface.\nPrevious studies reported that disagreements between the induced pressure value\non the solid-fluid movable interface and the value predicted by the classical\none-dimensional theory arose from the effects of two-dimensional wave\npropagation. To address this problem, in this study, a two-dimensional\naxisymmetric simulation of wave propagation across the solid-fluid interface\nwith FSI was conducted. The simulation was performed using ANSYS Autodyn with a\nLagrangian solver for solids and Eulerian solver for water. The results showed\nthat radial wave propagation caused by the dynamic effect of the tube and\nwater's inertia affected the peak pressure on the solid-fluid interface. The\npeak pressure was attenuated near the tube wall because of the inertial effect\nof the tube and fluid expansion. By calculating the mean pressure and axial\nstress to compare the simulated peak pressure with that from one-dimensional\nacoustic theory, it was indicated that the transition region for transmitted\npressure was located immediately after the solid-fluid interface. In this\nregion, the transmitted peak pressure may exceed the value predicted by\none-dimensional acoustic theory. The transition region was oriented in the\naxial direction from the interface. In addition, prediction of the transmitted\npeak pressure with one-dimensional acoustic theory was suggested via normal\nwave speed in the unconfined fluid from a safety engineering perspective,\nalthough the circumferential stress generated in the tube enclosing fluid can\nbe sufficiently accurately predicted using the same theory with the Korteweg\nspeed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jun 2020 01:18:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Nov 2020 10:38:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-11"}

In this paper, we seek to resolve this issue by proposing a\nnovel DRL scheme, coined learning what to defer (LwD), where the agent\nadaptively shrinks or stretch the number of stages by learning to distribute\nthe element-wise decisions of the solution at each stage. We apply the proposed\nframework to the maximum independent set (MIS) problem, and demonstrate its\nsignificant improvement over the current state-of-the-art DRL scheme. We also\nshow that LwD can outperform the conventional MIS solvers on large-scale graphs\nhaving millions of vertices, under a limited time budget.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jun 2020 02:19:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Jun 2020 06:17:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-30"}

We study in detail three rare\nspin-up events detected by Fermi/GBM and find that the spin derivatives are\ncorrelated with the Swift/BAT fluxes, following a relation of $\\dot{\\nu}\\propto\nF^{0.75\\pm0.05}$. All the spin-up events of GX 301-2 started about 10 days\nafter the periastron, which is the time needed for tidally stripped gas to\nreach the neutron star. The slow rotation of the optical companion implies that\nthe accreted matter is likely to have angular momentum in the direction of the\norbital motion, as in a Roche-Lobe-like overflow. As a result, the spin-up\nevents of GX 301-2 would favor accretion of a prograde disk to a prograde\nneutron star. We also find that the flare of intrinsic X-ray emission of GX\n301-2 happened 0.4 days before periastron, while the flare of low energy\nemission (2-10 keV) happened about 1.4 days before periastron. The preceding\nlow energy flare can be explained by stronger absorption of the intrinsic X-ray\nemission closer to the periastron. This finding weakened the need of the stream\nmodel. The pulse fraction of GX 301-2 near periastron is reduced heavily, which\nis likely caused by Compton scattering process. Compton reflection from the\noptical companion might be responsible for the observed orbital spin reversal\nof GX 301-2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jun 2020 03:33:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-24"}

When the flows are restricted to two spatial degrees of freedom\nthere is an exact specification that maps the three velocity components in RPC\nto the two velocity components and one temperature field in RBC. Using this, we\ndeduce several relations between both flows: (i) The Rayleigh number $Ra$ in\nconvection and the Reynolds $Re$ and rotation $R_\\Omega$ number in RPC flow are\nrelated by $Ra= Re^2 R_\\Omega (1-R_\\Omega)$.

The central idea underlying our framework is to quantify\nexploration in terms of the Shannon Entropy of the trajectories under the MDP\nand determine the stochastic policy that maximizes it while guaranteeing a low\nvalue of the expected cost along a trajectory. This resulting policy enhances\nthe quality of exploration early on in the learning process, and consequently\nallows faster convergence rates and robust solutions even in the presence of\nnoisy data as demonstrated in our comparisons to popular algorithms such as\nQ-learning, Double Q-learning and entropy regularized Soft Q-learning.

Due to the limited number of orthogonal channels, interference\nbetween channels adversely affects the fair distribution of bandwidth among\nmesh clients, causing node starvation in terms of insufficient bandwidth, which\nimpedes the adoption of WMN as an efficient access technology. Therefore, a\nfair channel assignment is crucial for the mesh clients to utilize the\navailable resources.

In\nsimulations, it performs better than an alternative transformation approach\nwhere one maps distributions to a Hilbert space through the log quantile\ndensity transformation and then applies traditional functional regression. We\nderive asymptotic rates of convergence for the estimator of the regression\noperator and for predicted distributions and also study an extension to\nautoregressive models for distribution-valued time series.

Currently, the vast\nmajority of studies assume that a review's helpfulness is self-contained. In\npractice, however, customers hardly process reviews independently given the\nsequential nature. The perceived helpfulness of a review is likely to be\naffected by its sequential neighbors (i.e., context), which has been largely\nignored. This paper proposes a new methodology to capture the missing\ninteraction between reviews and their neighbors. The first end-to-end neural\narchitecture is developed for neighbor-aware helpfulness prediction (NAP). For\neach review, NAP allows for three types of neighbor selection: its preceding,\nfollowing, and surrounding neighbors. Four weighting schemes are designed to\nlearn context clues from the selected neighbors. A review is then\ncontextualized into the learned clues for neighbor-aware helpfulness\nprediction. NAP is evaluated on six domains of real-world online reviews\nagainst a series of state-of-the-art baselines. Extensive experiments confirm\nthe effectiveness of NAP and the influence of sequential neighbors on a current\nreviews. Further hyperparameter analysis reveals three main findings. (1) On\naverage, eight neighbors treated with uneven importance are engaged for context\nconstruction. (2) The benefit of neighbor-aware prediction mainly results from\ncloser neighbors. (3) Equally considering up to five closest neighbors of a\nreview can usually produce a weaker but tolerable prediction result.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jun 2020 07:02:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-18"}

However, only limited information can be extracted\nfrom currently available spin measurements of MBHs owing to the small sample\nsize and large measurement uncertainties. Upcoming X-ray telescopes with\nimproved spectral resolution and larger effective area are expected to provide\nnew insights into the growth history of MBHs. Here we investigate, at a proof\nof concept level, how stringent constraints can be placed on the accretion\nhistory of MBHs by the spin measurements from future X-ray missions. We assume\na toy model consisting of a two-phase accretion history composed of an initial\ncoherent phase with a constant disk orientation, followed by a chaotic phase\nwith random disk orientations in each accretion episode. By utilizing mock spin\ndata generated from such models and performing Bayesian Markov Chain Monte\nCarlo simulations, we find that most accretion models of MBHs can be\nreconstructed provided that $\\gtrsim100$ MBH spins are measured with an\naccuracy of $\\lesssim0.1$. We also quantify the precision of the reconstructed\nparameters by adopting various combinations of sample sizes and spin\naccuracies, and find that the sample size is more crucial to model\nreconstruction once the spin accuracy reaches $\\sim 0.1$. To some extent, a\nbetter spin accuracy will compensate for a small sample size and vice versa.\nFuture X-ray missions such as the Advanced Telescope for High Energy\nAstrophysics and the enhanced X-ray Timing and Polarimetry mission, may provide\nspin measurements of $\\gtrsim100$ MBHs with an uncertainty of $\\sim0.04-0.1$\nand will thus put strong constraints on the MBH growth history.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jun 2020 07:46:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Jun 2020 01:01:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-19"}

The host ejecta could\nbe a single ICME or a complex ejecta, being fast enough to drive a shock. These\nresults clarify previous misinterpretations of this phenomenon as a normal part\nof a sheath region.

When a user moves erratically\namong multiple MEC nodes, the challenge of how to dynamically migrate its\nservice to maintain service performance (i.e., user-perceived latency) arises.\nHowever, frequent service migration can significantly increase operational\ncost, incurring the conflict between improving performance and reducing cost.\nTo address these mis-aligned objectives, this paper studies the performance\noptimization of mobile edge service placement under the constraint of long-term\ncost budget. It is challenging because the budget involves the future uncertain\ninformation (e.g., user mobility). To overcome this difficulty, we devote to\nleveraging the power of prediction and advocate predictive service placement\nwith predicted near-future information. By using two-timescale Lyapunov\noptimization method, we propose a T-slot predictive service placement (PSP)\nalgorithm to incorporate the prediction of user mobility based on a frame-based\ndesign.

Furthermore, we propose a new weight adjustment scheme\nfor the queue in each frame named PSP-WU to exploit the historical queue\ninformation, which greatly reduces the length of queue while improving the\nquality of user-perceived latency.

In addition, we investigate the relevance of short-range\nnonlocality and halo exclusion through higher-derivative and scale-dependent\nnoise terms, as well as the impact of using co-evolution relations to reduce\nthe number of free fitting parameters. From comparing validity and merit of\nthese assumptions we find that a four-parameter model (linear, quadratic, cubic\nnonlocal bias, and constant shot noise) with fixed quadratic tidal bias\nprovides a robust modeling choice for the auto power spectrum of the less\nmassive halos in our set of samples and their galaxy populations (up to\n$k_{\\mathrm{max}} = 0.35\\,h/\\mathrm{Mpc}$ for a sample volume of\n$6\\,(\\mathrm{Gpc}/h)^3$). For the more biased tracers it is most beneficial to\ninclude scale-dependent noise. This is also the preferred option when\nconsidering combinations of the auto and cross power spectrum, which might be\nrelevant in joint studies of galaxy clustering and weak lensing. We also test\nthe use of perturbation theory to account for matter loops through gRPT, EFT\nand the hybrid approach RESPRESSO.

We keep explicit\ntrack of ice abundances on a set of grain populations. We find that the\nsize-dependent CR desorption efficiency affects ice abundances in a highly\nnon-trivial way that depends on the molecule. Species that originate in the gas\nphase follow a simple pattern where the ice abundance is highest on the\nsmallest grains (the most abundant in the distribution). Some molecules, such\nas HCN, are instead concentrated on large grains throughout the time evolution,\nwhile others (like $\\rm N_2$) are initially concentrated on large grains, but\nat late times on small grains, due to grain-size-dependent competition between\ndesorption and hydrogenation.

In this work, we present a novel way to\npartition the parameter space without weakening the inductive bias.\nSpecifically, we propose Maximum Roaming, a method inspired by dropout that\nrandomly varies the parameter partitioning, while forcing them to visit as many\ntasks as possible at a regulated frequency, so that the network fully adapts to\neach update. We study the properties of our method through experiments on a\nvariety of visual multi-task data sets. Experimental results suggest that the\nregularization brought by roaming has more impact on performance than usual\npartitioning optimization strategies. The overall method is flexible, easily\napplicable, provides superior regularization and consistently achieves improved\nperformances compared to recent multi-task learning formulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jun 2020 10:25:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2020 10:55:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 22 Apr 2021 12:35:19 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 19 May 2021 09:20:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-01"}

It is shown that, contrary to\nthis conjecture, the perpendicular pressure can significantly enhance Tc in\nsystems off half-filling before it decreases Tc, and the strength of the\nenhancement significantly depends on the pairing symmetry. When the indices d,\nd', cz, and sz are defined for the basis functions cos k_x - cos k_y, sin k_x\nsin k_y, cos k_z, and sin k_z, respectively, it is shown that for s-, d-, cz-,\nand cz-d-wave pairing, Tc steeply increases with increasing t_z near a cusp at\na certain value of t_z. On the other hand, for p-, cz-p-, sz-p-, and d'-wave\npairing, Tc is almost unaffected by tz. For sz- and sz-d-wave pairing, Tc\nexhibits a broad and weak peak.

Measured up to $B\n= 33$ T, spectra exhibit a primary energy split between spin-polarized excited\nstates, and a secondary spin-dependent valley-split.

Noticing that velocity signals are usually noisy or not\navailable for feedback control in practical engineering systems, this paper\nsupposes that the velocity signals are not accessible for the players. To deal\nwith the absence of velocity measurements, two estimators are designed, based\non which Nash equilibrium seeking strategies are constructed. The first\nstrategy is established by employing an observer, which has the same order as\nthe players' dynamics, to estimate the unavailable system states (e.g., the\nplayers' velocities). The second strategy is designed based on a high-pass\nfilter and is motivated by the incentive to reduce the order of the closed-loop\nsystem which in turn reduces the computation costs of the seeking algorithm.\nExtensions to Nash equilibrium seeking for networked games are provided. Taking\nthe advantages of leader-following consensus protocols, it turns out that both\nthe observer-based method and the filter-based method can be adapted to deal\nwith games in distributed systems, which shows the extensibility of the\ndeveloped strategies. Through Lyapunov stability analysis, it is analytically\nproven that the players' actions can be regulated to the Nash equilibrium point\nand their velocities can be regulated to zero by utilizing the proposed\nvelocity-free Nash equilibrium seeking strategies.

However, in addition to an instantaneous part, the nonlinear\nfiber response consists of a delayed contribution, referred to as the Raman\nresponse. The imaginary part of its Fourier transform, referred to as the Raman\ngain spectrum, leads to inter-channel stimulated Raman scattering (ISRS). ISRS\nis a nonlinear effect that redistributes optical power from high to lower\nfrequencies during propagation. However, as the nonlinear fiber response is\ncausal, the Raman spectrum obeys the Kramers-Kronig relations resulting in the\nreal part of the complex valued Raman spectrum. While the impact of the\nimaginary part (i.e. ISRS) is well studied, the direct implications of its\nassociated real part on the NLI are unexplored.\n  In this work, a theory is proposed to analytically quantify the impact of the\nreal Raman spectrum on the nonlinear interference power. Starting from a\ngeneralized Manakov equation, an extension of the ISRS Gaussian Noise (GN)\nmodel is derived to include the real Raman spectrum and, thus, to account for\nthe complete nonlinear Raman response. Accurate integral expressions are\nderived and approximations in closed-form are proposed. Different formulations\nfor the case of single -and dual polarized signals are derived and novel\nanalytical approximations of the real Raman spectrum are proposed. Moreover, it\nis analytically shown that the real Raman spectrum scales the strength of the\ninstantaneous nonlinear distortions depending on the frequency separation of\nthe interacting frequencies. A simple functional form is derived to assess the\nscaling of the NLI strength. The proposed theory is validated by numerical\nsimulations over C-and C+L band, using experimentally measured fiber data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jun 2020 13:30:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-07"}

In essence, logic provides an\neasy way to specify properties that must hold in every possible world, and\nprobability allows us to further quantify the weight and ratio of the worlds\nthat must satisfy a property. To that end, numerous developments have been\nundertaken, culminating in proposals such as probabilistic relational models.\nWhile this progress has been notable, a general-purpose first-order knowledge\nrepresentation language to reason about probabilities and dynamics, including\nin continuous settings, is still to emerge. In this paper, we survey recent\nresults pertaining to the integration of logic, probability and actions in the\nsituation calculus, which is arguably one of the oldest and most well-known\nformalisms. We then explore reduction theorems and programming interfaces for\nthe language.

We show that if a graph\nadmits a $d$-contraction sequence, then it also has a linear-arity tree of\n$f(d)$-contractions, for some function $f$. First this permits to show that\nevery bounded twin-width class is small, i.e., has at most $n!c^n$ graphs\nlabeled by $[n]$, for some constant $c$. This unifies and extends the same\nresult for bounded treewidth graphs [Beineke and Pippert, JCT '69], proper\nsubclasses of permutations graphs [Marcus and Tardos, JCTA '04], and proper\nminor-free classes [Norine et al., JCTB '06].

The\nchemical richness in these environments has been so far studied only in the\nL1157 blue shifted outflow. Methods: To understand if the L1157-B1 case is\nunique, we imaged the NGC 1333 IRAS 4A outflows using the NOEMA (NOrthern\nExtended Millimeter Array) interferometer as part of the IRAM SOLIS (Seeds Of\nLife in Space) Large Program and compared the observations with the GRAINOBLE+\ngas phase astrochemical model. Results: Several iCOMs were detected in the IRAS\n4A outflows: methanol (CH$_3$OH), acetaldehyde (CH$_3$CHO), formamide\n(NH$_2$CHO) and dimethyl ether (CH$_3$OCH$_3$), all sampling upper excitation\nenergy up to $\\sim$30 K. We found a significant chemical differentiation\nbetween the IRAS 4A1 outflow, showing a richer molecular content, and the IRAS\n4A2 one. The CH$_3$OH/CH$_3$CHO abundance ratio is lower by a factor $\\sim$4 in\nthe former; furthermore the ratio in both outflows is lower by a factor\n$\\sim$10 with respect to hot corinos values. Conclusions: After L1157-B1, IRAS\n4A outflow is now the second outflow to show an evident chemical complexity.\nGiven that CH$_3$OH is a grain surface species, GRAINOBLE+ reproduced our\nobservations assuming acetaldehyde formation in gas phase by the reaction of\nethyl radical (CH$_3$CH$_2$) with atomic oxygen. Moreover, the chemical\ndifferentiation between the two outflows suggests that the IRAS 4A1 outflow is\nlikely younger than the IRAS 4A2 one. Further investigation is needed to\nconstrain the age of the outflow and observations of even younger shocks are\nnecessary and future spectroscopic studies on CH$_3$CH$_2$ are needed to be\nable to observe this species and provide strong constraints on the CH$_3$CHO\nformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jun 2020 15:11:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-19"}

In\nthe last few years, separable expansions have been used to represent the\noptical potential between a nucleon (proton or neutron) and a target.

Method: For a couple of cases, we use the\ngeneralized Ersnt-Shakin-Thaler scheme to generate separable interactions\nstarting from local optical potentials. We study the variation of the\ninteraction with energy range and rank. Results: We find that, overall the\noff-diagonal behavior of the converged separable interaction deviates from the\nGaussian form assumed by Perey and Buck. However, in the region surrounding the\nmaximum depth the Gaussian form works quite well.

By\nreducing contributions from shared activities, inter-subject variability can be\nenhanced. Results show that that refined connectomes utilizing an autoencoder\nwith sparse dictionary learning can successfully distinguish one individual\nfrom the remaining participants with reasonably high accuracy (up to 99:5% for\nthe rest-rest pair). Furthermore, high-level cognitive behavior (e.g., fluid\nintelligence, executive function, and language comprehension) can also be\nbetter predicted using refined functional connectivity profiles. As expected,\nthe high-order association cortices contributed more to both individual\ndiscrimination and behavior prediction.

Lossless graph\nsummarization is an effective graph-compression technique with many desirable\nproperties.

Such\nflames posses a large-scale pressure field that -- in addition to the pressure\nfields associated with small-scale turbulent vortices -- can interact with\ndensity gradients to produce baroclinic torque. Simultaneous tomographic\nparticle image velocimetry and formaldehyde planar laser induced fluorescence\nmeasurements are used to obtain high-resolution velocity and progress-variable\nfields. This allows statistical evaluation of the various terms in the\nenstrophy transport equation. The impact of small- and large-scale pressure\ngradients is assessed by conditioning the baroclinic torque on the position of\nthe fluid within the instantaneous flame front, within the flame brush, and\naxially within the combustor. At all conditions studied, the baroclinic torque\nwas a significant contributor to enstrophy transport, with a comparable\nmagnitude to vortex stretching and viscous diffusion. Enstrophy attenuation and\nproduction by baroclinic torque tended to occur towards the reactant and\nproduct sides of the instantaneous flame surface, respectively. However, the\nvalue of the baroclinic torque also depended equally strongly on the position\nin the combustor. Hence, both small- and large-scale pressure fields can result\nin significant enstrophy changes through baroclinic torque. This is evidence\nboth that flame-induced vorticity dynamics are significant in swirl combustion,\nand that large-scale geometry-dependent flow fields can impact flame-generated\nturbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jun 2020 15:38:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-02"}

Within a kinetic-rate\nequation approach as previously used for charmonia, the formation and\ndissociation of the $X(3872)$ is controlled by two transport parameters, i.e.,\nits inelastic reaction rate and thermal-equilibrium limit in the evolving hot\nQCD medium. While the equilibrium limit is controlled by the charm production\ncross section in primordial nucleon-nucleon collisions (together with the\nspectra of charm states in the medium), the structure information is encoded in\nthe reaction rate. We study how different scenarios for the rate affect the\ncentrality dependence and transverse-momentum ($p_T$) spectra of the $X(3872)$.\nLarger reaction rates associated with the loosely bound molecule structure\nimply that it is formed later in the fireball evolution than the tetraquark and\nthus its final yields are generally smaller by around a factor of two, which is\nqualitatively different from most coalescence model calculations to date.

To address this problem, we develop methods to\ngenerate view-consistent, high-fidelity, and high-resolution X-ray images from\nradiology reports to facilitate radiology training of medical students. This\ntask is presented with several challenges. First, from a single report, images\nwith different views (e.g., frontal, lateral) need to be generated. How to\nensure consistency of these images (i.e., make sure they are about the same\npatient)? Second, X-ray images are required to have high resolution. Otherwise,\nmany details of diseases would be lost. How to generate high-resolutions\nimages? Third, radiology reports are long and have complicated structure. How\nto effectively understand their semantics to generate high-fidelity images that\naccurately reflect the contents of the reports? To address these three\nchallenges, we propose an XRayGAN composed of three modules: (1) a view\nconsistency network that maximizes the consistency between generated\nfrontal-view and lateral-view images; (2) a multi-scale conditional GAN that\nprogressively generates a cascade of images with increasing resolution; (3) a\nhierarchical attentional encoder that learns the latent semantics of a\nradiology report by capturing its hierarchical linguistic structure and various\nlevels of clinical importance of words and sentences.

To be interpretable and\nuseful to humans, such a method should convey a model's learned classification\nstrategy in a way that is robust to random initializations or spurious\ncorrelations in input data. To this end, we applied the decompositional\npixel-wise attribution method of layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) to\nresolve the decisions of several classes of VGG-16 models trained for face\nrecognition. We then quantified how these relevance measures vary with and\ngeneralize across key model parameters, such as the pretraining dataset\n(ImageNet or VGGFace), the finetuning task (gender or identity classification),\nand random initializations of model weights. Using relevance-based image\nmasking, we find that relevance maps for face classification prove generally\nstable across random initializations, and can generalize across finetuning\ntasks. However, there is markedly less generalization across pretraining\ndatasets, indicating that ImageNet- and VGGFace-trained models sample face\ninformation differently even as they achieve comparably high classification\nperformance. Fine-grained analyses of relevance maps across models revealed\nasymmetries in generalization that point to specific benefits of choice\nparameters, and suggest that it may be possible to find an underlying set of\nimportant face image pixels that drive decisions across convolutional neural\nnetworks and tasks.

One of the key pedagogical\nchallenges in these environments is in designing new practice tasks for a\nstudent that match a desired level of difficulty and exercise specific\nprogramming concepts. In this paper, we formalize the problem of synthesizing\nvisual programming tasks. In particular, given a reference visual task $\\rm\nT^{in}$ and its solution code $\\rm C^{in}$, we propose a novel methodology to\nautomatically generate a set $\\{(\\rm T^{out}, \\rm C^{out})\\}$ of new tasks\nalong with solution codes such that tasks $\\rm T^{in}$ and $\\rm T^{out}$ are\nconceptually similar but visually dissimilar. Our methodology is based on the\nrealization that the mapping from the space of visual tasks to their solution\ncodes is highly discontinuous; hence, directly mutating reference task $\\rm\nT^{in}$ to generate new tasks is futile. Our task synthesis algorithm operates\nby first mutating code $\\rm C^{in}$ to obtain a set of codes $\\{\\rm C^{out}\\}$.\nThen, the algorithm performs symbolic execution over a code $\\rm C^{out}$ to\nobtain a visual task $\\rm T^{out}$; this step uses the Monte Carlo Tree Search\n(MCTS) procedure to guide the search in the symbolic tree. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our algorithm through an extensive empirical evaluation and\nuser study on reference tasks taken from the \\emph{Hour of Code: Classic Maze}\nchallenge by \\emph{Code.org} and the \\emph{Intro to Programming with Karel}\ncourse by \\emph{CodeHS.com}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jun 2020 15:04:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2020 22:37:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 5 Nov 2020 00:00:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-06"}
