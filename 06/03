To advance the application of\ndiamagnetically levitating resonators, it is important to characterize their\ndynamics in the presence of both magnetic and gravitational fields. Here we\nexperimentally actuate and measure rigid body modes of a diamagnetically\nlevitating graphite plate. We numerically calculate the magnetic field and\ndetermine the influence of magnetic force on the resonance frequencies of the\nlevitating plate. By analyzing damping mechanisms, we conclude that eddy\ncurrent damping dominates dissipation in mm-sized plates. We use finite element\nsimulations to model eddy current damping and find close agreement with\nexperimental results. We also study the size-dependent Q-factors (Qs) of\ndiamagnetically levitating plates and show that Qs above 100 million are\ntheoretically attainable by reducing the size of the diamagnetic resonator down\nto microscale, making these systems of interest for next generation low-noise\nresonant sensors and oscillators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2020 16:01:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2020 09:18:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 15 Jun 2022 15:34:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-16"}

Over the past decades,\na great variety of complex systems has been successfully described as networks\nwhose interacting pairs of nodes are connected by links. Yet, in face-to-face\nhuman communication, chemical reactions and ecological systems, interactions\ncan occur in groups of three or more nodes and cannot be simply described just\nin terms of simple dyads.

However, little attention has been paid to what precisely a group is.\nMany recent approaches to \"fairness\" require one to specify a causal model of\nthe data generating process. These exercises make an implicit ontological\nassumption that a racial or sex group is simply a collection of individuals who\nshare a given trait. We show this by exploring the formal assumption of\nmodularity in causal models, which holds that the dependencies captured by one\ncausal pathway are invariant to interventions on any other pathways. Causal\nmodels of sex propose two substantive claims: 1) There exists a feature,\nsex-on-its-own, that is an inherent trait of an individual that causally brings\nabout social phenomena external to it in the world; and 2) the relations\nbetween sex and its effects can be modified in whichever ways and the former\nfeature would still retain the meaning that sex has in our world. We argue that\nthis ontological picture is false. Many of the \"effects\" that sex purportedly\n\"causes\" are in fact constitutive features of sex as a social status. They give\nthe social meaning of sex features, meanings that are precisely what make sex\ndiscrimination a distinctively morally problematic type of action. Correcting\nthis conceptual error has a number of implications for how models can be used\nto detect discrimination. Formal diagrams of constitutive relations present an\nentirely different path toward reasoning about discrimination. Whereas causal\ndiagrams guide the construction of sophisticated modular counterfactuals,\nconstitutive diagrams identify a different kind of counterfactual as central to\nan inquiry on discrimination: one that asks how the social meaning of a group\nwould be changed if its non-modular features were altered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2020 16:51:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2020 22:54:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-08"}

The gaseous mixture-fraction variable as\nfunction of the physical space, Z(x_i), typically employed for the description\nof gaseous diffusion flames leads to non-monotonicity behaviour for spray\nflames due to the extra fuel supplied by vaporisation of droplets distributed\ninto the flow. As a result, the overall properties of spray flames depend not\nonly on Z and the scalar dissipation rate, but also on the spray source term,\nS_v. We propose a new general coordinate variable which takes into account the\nspatial information about the entire mixture fraction due to the gaseous phase\nand droplet vaporisation. This coordinate variable, Z_C(x_i) is based on the\ncumulative value of the gaseous mixture fraction Z(x_i), and is shown to be\nmonotonic. For pure gaseous flow, the new cumulative function, Z_C, yields the\nwell-established flamelet structure in Z-space. In the present manuscript, the\nspray-flamelet structure and the new equations for temperature and mass\nfractions in terms of Z_C are derived and then applied to the canonical\ncounterflow configuration with potential flow.

Regional dropout is one of the\npopular solutions that guides the model to focus on less discriminative parts\nby randomly removing image regions, resulting in improved regularization.\nHowever, such information removal is undesirable. On the other hand, recent\nstrategies suggest to randomly cut and mix patches and their labels among\ntraining images, to enjoy the advantages of regional dropout without having any\npointless pixel in the augmented images. We argue that such random selection\nstrategies of the patches may not necessarily represent sufficient information\nabout the corresponding object and thereby mixing the labels according to that\nuninformative patch enables the model to learn unexpected feature\nrepresentation.

Here we report on our\nhydrodynamic studies of the thermonuclear runaway (TNR) in the accreted\nmaterial that ends in a Classical Nova explosion. We have followed the\nevolution of the TNRs on both carbon-oxygen (CO) and oxygen-neon (ONe) WDs. We\nreport on 3 studies in this paper. First, simulations in which we accrete only\nsolar matter using NOVA (our 1-D, fully implicit, hydro code). Second, we use\nMESA for similar studies in which we accrete only Solar matter and compare the\nresults. Third, we accrete solar matter until the TNR is ongoing and then\nswitch the composition in the accreted layers to a mixed composition: either\n25% WD and 75% solar or 50% WD and 50% Solar matter. We find that the amount of\naccreted material is inversely proportional to the initial 12C abundance (as\nexpected). Thus, accreting solar matter results in a larger amount of accreted\nmaterial to fuel the outburst; much larger than in earlier studies where a\nmixed composition was assumed from the beginning of the simulation. Our most\nimportant result is that all these simulations eject significantly less mass\nthan accreted and, therefore, the WD is growing in mass toward the\nChandrasekhar Limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2020 17:59:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-03"}

We identify a region where the\nDAOs still leave a distinct signature from WDM down to $z=5$, while a large\npart of the DAO parameter space is shown to be degenerate with WDM. Our\nframework can then be used to seamlessly connect a broad class of particle DM\nmodels to their structure formation properties at high redshift without the\nneed of additional $N$-body simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2020 18:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Sep 2020 16:13:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-28"}

It is difficult to track the\nmerging process of SMBHs during mergers of galaxies as SMBHs are naturally\ndifficult to observe. We want to characterise and confirm the presence of two\nindependent active galactic nuclei (AGN) separated by a few kiloparsec in seven\nstrongly interacting galaxies previously selected from the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey (SDSS) as Seyfert-Seyfert pairs based on emission-line ratio\ndiagnostics. Optical slit spectra taken with MODS at the Large Binocular\nTelescope (LBT) are presented to infer the detailed spatial distribution of\noptical emission lines, and their line ratios and AGN signatures with respect\nto the host galaxies, thereby quantifying the impact of beam smearing and large\nfibre apertures on the spectra captured by the SDSS. We find that at most two\nof the seven targets actually retain a Seyfert-Seyfert dual AGN, whereas the\nothers may be more likely powered by post-AGB stars in retired galaxies or\nthrough shocks in the ISM based on spatially resolved optical line diagnostics.\nThe major cause of this discrepancy is a bias caused by the spillover of flux\nfrom the primary source in the secondary SDSS fibre which can be more than an\norder of magnitude at <3\" separations. Previously reported extremely low\nX-ray-to-[\\ion{O}{iii}] luminosity ratios may be explained by this\nmisclassification, as can heavily obscured AGN for the primaries.

SDEs are mathematical models of stochastic\nprocesses that capture how states evolve continuously in time. They are widely\nused in numerous applications such as engineered systems (e.g., modeling how\npedestrians move in an intersection), computational finance (e.g., modeling\nstock option prices), and ecological processes (e.g., population change over\ntime). Previously the safety verification problem has been tackled over finite\nand infinite time horizons using a diverse set of approaches. The approach in\nthis paper attempts to connect the two views by first identifying a finite time\nbound, beyond which the probability of a safety violation can be bounded by a\nnegligibly small number. This is achieved by discovering an exponential barrier\ncertificate that proves exponentially converging bounds on the probability of\nsafety violations over time. Once the finite time interval is found, a\nfinite-time verification approach is used to bound the probability of violation\nover this interval. We demonstrate our approach over a collection of\ninteresting examples from the literature, wherein our approach can be used to\nfind tight bounds on the violation probability of safety properties over the\ninfinite time horizon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2020 18:18:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-04"}

In this paper we present the\nresults from a series of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations of\nhead-on collisions of planets with significant atmospheres and bare projectiles\nwithout atmospheres. Collisions between planets can have sufficient energy to\nremove substantial fractions of the mass from the target planet.

One strategy to densify these gases is to pack the fuel tank with a\nporous adsorbent material. The US Department of Energy (DOE) has set volumetric\ndeliverable capacity targets which, if met, would help enable commercial\nadoption of hydrogen/natural gas as transportation fuels. Here, we present a\ntheoretical upper bound on the deliverable capacity of a gas in a rigid porous\nmaterial via an isothermal pressure swing.

We present a novel approach\nto generating random logic programs and random probabilistic logic programs\nusing constraint programming, introducing a new constraint to control the\nindependence structure of the underlying probability distribution. We also\nprovide a combinatorial argument for the correctness of the model, show how the\nmodel scales with parameter values, and use the model to compare probabilistic\ninference algorithms across a range of synthetic problems. Our model allows\ninference algorithm developers to evaluate and compare the algorithms across a\nwide range of instances, providing a detailed picture of their (comparative)\nstrengths and weaknesses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2020 19:12:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Sep 2020 16:40:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-14"}

Unfortunately,\nthis approach is unable to adequately characterize dependencies among\ndimensions and/or results in discretizations consisting of more cells (or bins)\nthan is desirable.\n  To address this problem, we propose an expressive model class that allows for\nfar more flexible partitions of two-dimensional data. We extend the state of\nthe art for the one-dimensional case to obtain a model selection problem based\non the normalized maximum likelihood, a form of refined MDL.

This effect is attenuated when the MB produced by a\nmagnetic field is present.

However, it remains an open question what\ncomputational architecture best characterizes the expectations deployed in real\ntime by humans that determine the behavioral signatures of reading. Here we\ntest over two dozen models, independently manipulating computational\narchitecture and training dataset size, on how well their next-word\nexpectations predict human reading time behavior on naturalistic text corpora.\nWe find that across model architectures and training dataset sizes the\nrelationship between word log-probability and reading time is (near-)linear. We\nnext evaluate how features of these models determine their psychometric\npredictive power, or ability to predict human reading behavior. In general, the\nbetter a model's next-word expectations, the better its psychometric predictive\npower. However, we find nontrivial differences across model architectures. For\nany given perplexity, deep Transformer models and n-gram models generally show\nsuperior psychometric predictive power over LSTM or structurally supervised\nneural models, especially for eye movement data. Finally, we compare models'\npsychometric predictive power to the depth of their syntactic knowledge, as\nmeasured by a battery of syntactic generalization tests developed using methods\nfrom controlled psycholinguistic experiments. Once perplexity is controlled\nfor, we find no significant relationship between syntactic knowledge and\npredictive power. These results suggest that different approaches may be\nrequired to best model human real-time language comprehension behavior in\nnaturalistic reading versus behavior for controlled linguistic materials\ndesigned for targeted probing of syntactic knowledge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2020 19:47:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-04"}

To obtain statistically\nsignificant constraint on the presence of low-mass companions beyond the\ntypical detection limit of current surveys ($\\Delta \\mathrm{mag} \\lesssim 5$ at\n$\\rho \\lesssim 1$\"), we initiated a survey of O and Wolf-Rayet stars in the\nCarina region using the SPHERE coronagraphic instrument on the VLT.

In this\npaper, we investigate one natural approach to this problem, of modulating\nresponse prosody, i.e., changing the pitch and cadence of the response to\nindicate delight, sadness or other common emotions, as well as using\npre-recorded interjections. Intuitively, this approach should improve the\nnaturalness of the conversation, but attempts to quantify the effects of\nprosodic modulation on user satisfaction and engagement remain challenging.

Our results indicate that the\nprosody modulation significantly increases both immediate and overall user\nsatisfaction.

Using\nthe qRMCM, we demonstrate isolation up to 45 dB within 13 MHz, when both\ndirectional devices are operated as isolators, and low-noise amplification in\nexcess of 10 dB within a dynamical bandwidth of $10$ MHz, when the\nreconfigurable device is operated as an amplifier.

Relative to the state-of-the-art sparse PCA\nmethods of Witten et al., Yuan & Zhang and Tan et al., the fixed threshold\nEESPCA technique offers an order-of-magnitude improvement in computational\nspeed, does not require estimation of tuning parameters via cross-validation,\nand can more accurately identify true zero principal component loadings across\na range of data matrix sizes and covariance structures. Importantly, the EESPCA\nmethod achieves these benefits while maintaining out-of-sample reconstruction\nerror and PC estimation error close to the lowest error generated by all\nevaluated approaches. EESPCA is a practical and effective technique for sparse\nPCA with particular relevance to computationally demanding statistical problems\nsuch as the analysis of high-dimensional data sets or application of\nstatistical techniques like resampling that involve the repeated calculation of\nsparse PCs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2020 20:14:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Dec 2020 15:42:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 23 Sep 2021 21:31:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-12"}

Our approach tailors the simulation initial\nconditions to the observed properties of R4 and implements realistic stellar\nprofiles generated by the 1d stellar evolution code MESA onto the 3d grid,\nresolving the merger inspiral to within $0.02\\, R_{\\odot}$. We then map the\nmerger remnant into MESA to track its evolution on the HR diagram over a period\nof $10^4$ years. This generates models for a B[e] supergiant with stellar\nproperties, age, and nebula structure in qualitative agreement with that of the\nR4 system. Our calculations provide concrete evidence to support the idea that\nR4 was originally a member of a triple system in which the inner binary merged\nafter its most massive member evolved off the main sequence, producing a new\nobject that is of similar mass yet significantly more luminous than the A\nsupergiant companion. The potential applications of the code framework\npresented in this paper are wide ranging and can be used to generate models of\na variety of merger stellar remnants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2020 21:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Aug 2020 17:56:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-30"}

Secondly,\nthe set of vanishing flats forms a combinatorial configuration called partial\nquadruple system, since it convey detailed structural information about $f$.

Although these q-ary trees reduce\nthe branching factor and height, they still have their heights based on the key\nlength, and are forced to fixed heights. Instead of basing nodes on q-ary\nprefix trees, the B Merkle Tree incorporates concise intranode commitments\nwithin a self-balancing tree. The tree is based on the ordering of elements,\nwhich requires extra information to determine element placement, but it enables\nsignificantly smaller proof sizes. This allows for much lower tree heights\n(directed by the order of elements, not the size of the key), and therefore\ncreates smaller and more efficient proofs and operations. Additionally, the B\nMerkle Tree is defined with subset queries that feature similar communication\ncosts to non-membership proofs. Our scheme has the potential to benefit\noutsourced database models, like blockchain, which use authenticated data\nstructures and database indices to ensure immutability and integrity of data.\nWe present potential applications in key-value stores, relational databases,\nand, in part, Merkle forests.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jun 2020 00:40:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 7 Jun 2020 00:08:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 16 Jun 2020 01:59:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-17"}

The most important reason for this is\nthat the model fitting, or \"inversion\", used to infer physical quantities from\nthe observations is extremely slow, because the underlying models are\nnumerically demanding. We aim to improve the speed of the inference by using a\nneural network that relates input polarized spectra to the output physical\nparameters. We first select a subset of the data to be interpreted and infer\nphysical quantities from corresponding spectra using a standard\nminimization-based inversion code. Taking these results as reliable and\nrepresentative of the whole data set, we train a convolutional neural network\nto connect the input polarized spectra to the output physical parameters\n(nodes, in context of spectropolarimetric inversion). We then apply the neural\nnetwork to the various other data, previously unseen to the network. As a\ncheck, we apply the referent inversion code to the unseen data and compare the\nfit quality and the maps of the inferred parameters between the two inversions.\nThe physical parameters inferred by the neural network show excellent agreement\nwith the results from the inversion, and are obtained in a factor of $10^5$\nless time. Additionally, substituting the results of the neural network back in\nthe forward model, shows excellent agreement between inferred and original\nspectra.

For the first time at such high redshift,\nthis deep data set provides a measurement of metallicity outside the cluster\ncenter; at radii $r > 0.3 r_{500}$, we find it to be $0.33 \\pm 0.17$, in good\nagreement with precise measurements at similar radii in the most nearby\nclusters, supporting an early enrichment scenario in which the bulk of the\ncluster gas is enriched to a universal metallicity prior to cluster formation,\nwith little to no evolution thereafter.

First, the proposed method allows for a non-linear combination\nof the base forecasts, thus being more general than the linear approaches.\nSecond, it structurally combines the objectives of improved post-sample\nempirical forecasting accuracy and coherence. Finally, due to its non-linear\nnature, our approach selectively combines the base forecasts in a direct and\nautomated way without requiring that the complete information must be used for\nproducing reconciled forecasts for each series and level. The proposed method\nis evaluated both in terms of accuracy and bias using two different data sets\ncoming from the tourism and retail industries. Our results suggest that the\nproposed method gives superior point forecasts than existing approaches,\nespecially when the series comprising the hierarchy are not characterized by\nthe same patterns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jun 2020 04:49:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-04"}

The usually discovered broken-power-law\napparent LF for relatively high luminosities can naturally result from the\ncoupling of the intrinsic LF with the angular distribution of the jet emission,\nas the viewing angles to the SGRBs are arbitrarily distributed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jun 2020 06:05:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 01:49:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-21"}

We also find clear thermal Hall\nsignals in the spin liquid phase in all Cd-K samples. The magnitude of the\nthermal Hall conductivity k_xy shows a significant dependence on the sample's\nscattering time.

These results indicate the presence of a dominant phonon thermal\nHall k_xy^ph at 15 T.

Remarkably, by\nassembling the k_xx dependene of k_xy^sp data of other kagome antiferromagnets,\nwe find that, whereas k_xy^sp stays a constant in the low-k_xx region, k_xy^sp\nstarts to increase as k_xx does in the high-k_xx region.

This recursive method has\ncomputationally efficient properties, while VTE alleviates some convergence\ndifficulties encountered by the usual QML estimation due to a lack of\nconvexity. Empirical results demonstrate a favorable trade-off between AdaVol's\nstability and the ability to adapt to time-varying estimates for real-life\ndata.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jun 2020 07:28:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Oct 2020 13:11:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 10 Jan 2021 15:22:43 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 17 Jan 2021 09:38:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-19"}

The decidability of some extensions of $\\mathcal{ALC}$\nwith non-dense domains has been shown, but existing results rely on powerful\nmachinery that does not allow to infer any elementary bounds on the complexity\nof the problem.

The main objective is to deliver a fast power response to\nfrequency deviations by utilizing the kinetic energy of the turbine and\ngenerator. This is made possible by allowing the turbine rotational speed to\ndeviate temporarily from its optimal speed. In addition, the efficiency should\nbe maximized while keeping the electric and hydraulic variables within their\nconstraints. The simulation results show that the proposed MPC is also able to\ndamp power oscillations in the grid, reduce water hammering in the penstock and\nimprove the future estimation of turbine head, turbine power and turbine flow.\nThis ensures that the turbine head does not exceed its limits and that the\novershoot in the turbine speed after a disturbance is reduced. Besides, the VSG\nconverter control enables a fast power response by utilizing the rotational\nenergy of the turbine and generator. Thereby, the VSHP can provide a\nsignificant amount of fast frequency reserves (FFR) to the grid.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jun 2020 08:27:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-04"}

Following Duan's topological current\n$\\phi$-mapping theory, the topological current and charge for the photon\nspheres are introduced. The topological current is nonzero only at the zero\npoint of the vector field determining the location of the photon sphere. So\neach photon sphere can be assigned a topological charge. Considering the full\nexterior region, we find the total topological charge always equals -1. This\nresult confirms that there exists at least one standard photon sphere outside\nof the black hole not only in asymptotically flat spacetime, but also in\nasymptotically AdS and dS spacetime. Then we apply the study to the dyonic\nblack holes. We observe that even when more photon spheres are included, the\ntotal topological charge stays unchanged. Moreover, for a naked singularity, it\nhas a vanishing topological charge, indicating that the black hole and naked\nsingularity are in different topological classes.

We here investigate this process\nusing a 3D simulation of oxygen shell burning in a $3M_\\odot$ He star. Our\nmodel indicates that stochastic spin-up by IGWs is less efficient than\npreviously thought. We find that the stochastic angular momentum flux carried\nby waves excited at the shell boundary is significantly smaller for a given\nconvective luminosity and turnover time than would be expected from simple\ndimensional analysis. This can be explained by noting that the waves launched\nby overshooting convective plumes contain modes of opposite angular wave number\nwith similar amplitudes, so that the net angular momentum of excited wave\npackets almost cancels. We find that the wave-mediated angular momentum flux\nfrom the oxygen shell follows a random walk, but again dimensional analysis\noverestimates the random walk amplitudes since the correlation time is only a\nfraction of the convective turnover time. Extrapolating our findings over the\nentire life time of the last burning stages prior to collapse, we predict that\nthe core angular momentum from stochastic spin-up would translate into long\nbirth spin periods of several seconds for low-mass progenitors and no less than\n100ms even for high-mass progenitors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jun 2020 10:19:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2020 11:43:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-31"}

To\nachieve this, a combined control and design problem has to be solved which\nresults in a non-convex Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Program. To solve this design\ntask more efficiently, we present a new systematic optimization approach that\nleads to a convex Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Program. The solution process is\nbased on a combination of Geometric Programming and a Benders decomposition.\nThe benefits of this approach are a fast solution time, a global convergence,\nand the ability to derive local sensitivities in the optimal design point with\nno extra cost, as they are computed in the optimization procedure by solving a\ndual problem. The presented approach is suitable for the evaluation of a\ncomplete driving cycle, as this is commonly done in powertrain system design,\nor for usage in a stochastic approach, where multiple scenarios are sampled\nfrom a given probability density function. The latter is useful, to account for\nthe uncertainty in the driving behavior to generate solutions that are optimal\nin an average sense for a high variety of vehicles and drive conditions. For\nthe powertrain model we use a transmission model with up to two selectable\ntransmission ratios and an electric motor model that is based on a scaled\nefficiency map representation.

The distinguishing prefix size $D$ of a set of strings\nis the number of symbols that actually need to be inspected to establish the\nlexicographical ordering of all strings. Efficient string sorters should be\n$D$-aware, i.e. their complexity should depend on $D$ rather than on the total\nnumber $N$ of all symbols in all strings. While there are many $D$-aware\nsorters in the sequential setting, there appear to be no such results in the\nPRAM model. We propose a framework yielding a $D$-aware modification of any\nexisting PRAM string sorter. The derived algorithms are work-optimal with\nrespect to their original counterpart: If the original algorithm requires\n$O(w(N))$ work, the derived one requires $O(w(D))$ work. The execution time\nincreases only by a small factor that is logarithmic in the length of the\nlongest relevant prefix. Our framework universally works for deterministic and\nrandomized algorithms in all variations of the PRAM model, such that future\nimprovements in ($D$-unaware) parallel string sorting will directly result in\nimprovements in $D$-aware parallel string sorting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jun 2020 12:30:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-04"}

The time-delayed ultrashort probe laser pulses monitor the propagation\nof the coherent acoustic pulses via photo-elastic effect, which induces light\nscattering. A photodetector collects acoustically scattered light and the probe\nlight reflected by the sample structure for the heterodyning. The scattered\nprobe light carriers the information on the acoustical, optical and\nacousto-optical parameters of the material in the current position of the\ncoherent acoustic pulse. Thus, among other applications, the time-domain\nBrillouin scattering is a technique for three-dimensional imaging.

In\nthis paper we take a novel perspective, arguing that the value prediction\nproblems faced by an RL agent should not be addressed in isolation, but rather\nas a single, holistic, prediction problem. An RL algorithm generates a sequence\nof policies that, at least approximately, improve towards the optimal policy.\nWe explicitly characterize the associated sequence of value functions and call\nit the value-improvement path. Our main idea is to approximate the\nvalue-improvement path holistically, rather than to solely track the value\nfunction of the current policy.

The interaction of GCRs\nand the shock/sheath region, as well as the CME magnetic structure, occurs all\nthe way from Sun to Earth, therefore, FDs are expected to reflect the\nevolutionary properties of CMEs and their sheaths. We apply modelling to\ndifferent ICME regions in order to obtain a generic two-step FD profile, which\nqualitatively agrees with our current observation-based understanding of FDs.\nWe next adapt the models for energy dependence to enable comparison with\ndifferent GCR measurement instruments (as they measure in different particle\nenergy ranges).

These\nobservations reach a uniform depth down to a median rms of ~10 uJy,\nrepresenting one of most sensitive searches for radio emission associated with\nnuclear transients. We detect radio emission in 12 out of 16 galaxies at a\nlevel of >5sigma, corresponding to a detection rate of 75%. Such a high\ndetection is remarkably different from previous similar searches in stellar\ntidal disruption events. The radio emission is compact and not resolved for the\nmajority of sources on scales of ~<0.5\" (<0.9 kpc at z<0.1). We find the\npossibility of the star-formation contributing to the radio emission is low,\nbut an AGN origin remains a plausible scenario, especially for sources that\nshow evidence of AGN activity in their optical spectra. If the detections could\nrepresent radio emission associated with nuclear transient phenomenon such as\njet or outflow, we use the blast wave model by analogy with the GRB afterglows\nto describe the evolution of radio light curves. In this context, the\nobservations are consistent with a decelerating jet with an energy of\n~10^{51-52} erg viewed at 30\\degree-60\\degree off-axis at later times,\nsuggesting that powerful jets may be ubiquitous among MIR-burst galaxies.\nFuture continuous monitoring observations will be crucial to decipher the\norigin of radio emission through detections of potential flux and spectral\nevolution.

As wireless networks become more\ncomplex, it is impractical to perform testing on a real deployment. As a\nresult, the network administrators rely on network simulators or network\nemulators to validate their configurations and design. Unfortunately, network\nsimulation falls short per it requires users to model the network behavior\nanalytically. On the other hand, network emulation allows users to employ real\nnetwork applications on virtualized network devices. Despite their complex\ndesign, the existing network emulation solutions miss full-scale automation\nrather they rely on experienced users to write complex configuration scripts\nmaking testing. Therefore, the validation process is prone to human operator\nerrors. Furthermore, they require a significant amount of computational\nresources that might not be feasible for many users. Moreover, most network\nemulators focus on lower layers of the network thus requiring users to employ\ntheir own network applications to control and measure network performance. To\novercome these challenges, we propose a novel wireless network emulation\nplatform, the system, that provides users a unified, high-level configuration\ninterface for different layers of wireless networks to reduce management\ncomplexities of network emulators while having a generic, fully-automated\nplatform.

Existing image enhancement technologies are prone\nto overenhancement, color distortion or time consumption, and their\nadaptability is fairly limited. Therefore, we propose a new single low-light\nimage lightness enhancement method. First, an energy model is presented based\non the analysis of membrane vibrations induced by photon stimulations. Then,\nbased on the unique mathematical properties of the energy model and combined\nwith the gamma correction model, a new global lightness enhancement model is\nproposed. Furthermore, a special relationship between image lightness and gamma\nintensity is found. Finally, a local fusion strategy, including segmentation,\nfiltering and fusion, is proposed to optimize the local details of the global\nlightness enhancement images. Experimental results show that the proposed\nalgorithm is superior to nine state-of-the-art methods in avoiding color\ndistortion, restoring the textures of dark areas, reproducing natural colors\nand reducing time cost.

To address this issue, statistical\ntechniques have been proposed to objectively evaluate QI methods without a gold\nstandard. These techniques assume that the measured and true values are\nlinearly related by a slope, bias, and normally distributed noise term, where\nit is assumed that the noise term between the different methods is independent.\nHowever, the noise could be correlated since it arises in the process of\nmeasuring the same true value. To address this issue, we propose a new\nno-gold-standard evaluation (NGSE) technique that models this noise as a\nmultivariate normally distributed term, characterized by a covariance matrix.\nIn this manuscript, we derive a maximum-likelihood-based technique that,\nwithout any knowledge of the true QI values, estimates the slope, bias, and\ncovariance matrix terms. These are then used to rank the methods on the basis\nof precision of the measured QI values. Overall, the derivation demonstrates\nthe mathematical premise behind the proposed NGSE technique.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jun 2020 14:20:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-04"}

The standard scenario\ncomprises the early assembly of the bulge followed by disk accretion. However,\nrecent observational evidence points to a joint formation and perpetual\nco-evolution of these structural components. Our current knowledge on the\nproperties of bulge and disk is mostly founded on photometric decomposition\nstudies, which sensitively depend on the adopted methodology and enclosed\nassumptions on the structure of LTGs. A critical assumption whose validity was\nnever questioned is that galactic disks conserve their exponential nature up to\nthe galactic center. This implies that bulge and disk co-exist without\nsignificant dynamical interaction and mass exchange over nearly the entire\nHubble time. Our goal is to examine the validity of the standard assumption\nthat galactic disks preserve their exponential intensity profile inside the\nbulge radius all the way to the galactic center. We developed a\nspectrophotometric bulge-disk decomposition technique that provides an\nestimation for the net spectrum of the bulge. A systematic application of our\nspectrophotometric bulge-disk decomposition tool to a representative sample of\n135 local LTGs from the CALIFA Survey yields a significant fraction (up to\n~30%) of unphysical net-bulge spectra when a purely exponential intensity\nprofile is assumed for the disk. The obtained results suggest that, for a\nsignificant fraction of LTGs, the disk component shows a down-bending beneath\nthe bulge. If proven to be true, such result will call for a substantial\nrevision of structural decomposition studies for LTGs and have far-reaching\nimplications in our understanding of the photometric properties of their\nbulges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jun 2020 14:50:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-12"}

In this regime the\nclassical torque model breaks down and we show that a skyrmion driven by spin\ntransfer torque moves in a different direction than predicted by the classical\nmodel. However, the amount of charge current required to move a skyrmion with a\ncertain velocity in the single band regime is similar to a classical model of\ntorque where it is implicitly assumed current transport by many conduction\nbands. The single band regime is more efficient creating spin current from\ncharge current because of the perfect polarization of the single band but is\nless efficient creating torque from spin current. Nevertheless, it is possible\nto take profit of the single band regime to move skyrmions even with no net\ncharge or spin current flowing between the device contacts.

Unfortunately, current PoW defenses have two main drawbacks.\nFirst, they require work to be done even in the absence of an attack. Second,\nduring an attack, they require good identities (IDs) to spend as much as the\nattacker.\n  Recent theoretical work by Gupta, Saia, and Young suggests the possibility of\novercoming these two drawbacks. In particular, they describe a new algorithm,\nGMCom, that always ensures that a minority of IDs are Sybil. They show that\nrate at which all good IDs perform computation is $O(J_G + \\sqrt{T(J_G+1)})$,\nwhere $J_G$ is the join rate of good IDs, and $T$ is the rate at which the\nadversary performs computation.\n  Unfortunately, this cost bound only holds in the case where (1) GMCom always\nknows the join rate of good IDs; and (2) there is a fixed constant amount of\ntime that separates join events by good IDs. Here, we present ToGCom, which\nremoves these two shortcomings. To do so, we design and analyze a mechanism for\nestimating the join rate of good IDs; and also devise a new method for setting\nthe computational cost to join the system. Additionally, we evaluate the\nperformance of ToGCom alongside prior PoW-based defenses. Based on our\nexperiments, we design heuristics that further improve the performance of\nToGCom by up to $3$ orders of magnitude over these previous Sybil defenses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jun 2020 06:52:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-05"}

We examine this\nquestion in the context of a four team league which consists of a round robin\n\"regular season\" followed by a single elimination tournament with seedings\ndetermined by the results from the regular season [4].

The contemporary scholars\nemploy simultaneously the quaternions and octonions to investigate the physical\nproperties of electromagnetic fields, including the octonion field strength,\nfield source, linear momentum, angular momentum, torque, and force and so\nforth. When the octonion force is equal to zero, it is able to achieve eight\nequations independent of each other, including the fluid continuity equation,\ncurrent continuity equation, force equilibrium equation, and second-force\nequilibrium equation and so on.

The wind controls the star's angular momentum loss, which\ndepends on the magnetic field geometry which varies significantly in time and\nlatitude. Here we study basic properties of a self-consistent model that\nincludes simple representations of both the global stellar dynamo in a\nspherical shell and the exterior in which the wind accelerates and becomes\nsupersonic. We numerically solve an axisymmetric mean-field model for the\ninduction, momentum, and continuity equations using an isothermal equation of\nstate. The model allows for the simultaneous generation of a mean magnetic\nfield and the development of a Parker wind. The resulting flow is transonic at\nthe critical point, which we arrange to be between the inner and outer radii of\nthe model. The boundary conditions are assumed to be such that the magnetic\nfield is antisymmetric about the equator, i.e., dipolar. At the solar rotation\nrate, the dynamo is oscillatory and of $\\alpha^2$ type. In most of the domain,\nthe magnetic field corresponds to that of a split monopole. The magnetic energy\nflux is largest between the stellar surface and the critical point. The angular\nmomentum flux is highly variable in time and can reach negative values,\nespecially at midlatitudes. At rapid rotation of up to 50 times the solar\nvalue, most of the magnetic field is lost along the axis within the inner\ntangential cylinder of the model. The model reveals unexpected features that\nare not generally anticipated from models that are designed to reproduce the\nsolar wind: highly variable angular momentum fluxes even from just an\n$\\alpha^2$ dynamo in the star.

These systems describe the cardiac action\npotential, that is the polarization/depolarization cycle occurring at every\nheart beat that models the time evolution of the electrical potential across\nthe cell membrane, as well as a set of ionic variables. Multiple solutions of\nthese systems, corresponding to different model inputs, are required to\nevaluate outputs of clinical interest, such as activation maps and action\npotential duration. More importantly, these models feature coherent structures\nthat propagate over time, such as wavefronts. These systems can hardly be\nreduced to lower dimensional problems by conventional reduced order models\n(ROMs) such as, e.g., the reduced basis (RB) method. This is primarily due to\nthe low regularity of the solution manifold (with respect to the problem\nparameters) as well as to the nonlinear nature of the input-output maps that we\nintend to reconstruct numerically. To overcome this difficulty, in this paper\nwe propose a new, nonlinear approach which exploits deep learning (DL)\nalgorithms to obtain accurate and efficient ROMs, whose dimensionality matches\nthe number of system parameters.

We\nfollow the same standard approach as BERT masking a percentage of the tokens\npositions and then predicting their original values using an additional fully\nconnected classifier stage. This approach has shown good performance gains\n(.3\\% improvement) for the SQUAD additional improvement in convergence times.\nFor the Graphcore IPU the convergence of BERT Base with position masking\nrequires only 50\\% of the tokens from the original BERT paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2020 23:40:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-11"}

Accounting for moist processes in systematic scale analyses\ntherefore seems of considerable importance for the field. Klein & Majda (TCFD,\n20, 525--552, (2006)) proposed a scaling regime for the incorporation of moist\nbulk microphysics closures in multiscale asymptotic analyses of tropical deep\nconvection. This regime is refined here to allow for mixtures of ideal gases\nand to establish consistency with a more general multiple scales modelling\nframework for atmospheric flows. Deep narrow updrafts, so-called \"hot towers\",\nconstitute principal building blocks of larger scale storm systems. They are\nanalysed here in a sample application of the new scaling regime. A single\nquasi-onedimensional columnar cloud is considered on the vertical advective (or\ntower life cycle) time scale. The refined asymptotic scaling regime is\nessential for this example as it reveals a new mechanism for the\nself-sustainance of such updrafts. Even for strongly positive convectively\navailable potential energy (CAPE), a vertical balance of buoyancy forces is\nfound in the presence of precipitation. This balance induces a diagnostic\nequation for the vertical velocity and it is responsible for the generation of\nself-sustained balanced updrafts. The time dependent updraft structure is\nencoded in a Hamilton-Jacobi equation for the precipitation mixing ratio.\nNumerical solutions of this equation suggest that the self-sustained updrafts\nmay strongly enhance hot tower life cycles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jun 2020 14:47:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-16"}

Since previous\nwork has focused on classical and metaheuristic-based approaches, none of these\napproaches have a self-adaptive approach. In this paper, the challenges and\nweaknesses of previous methods are examined in the form of a table.\nFurthermore, we propose an agent-based self-protective method (ASP-UAVN) for\nUAVNs that is based on the Human Immune System (HIS). In ASP-UAS, the safest\nroute from the source UAV to the destination UAV is chosen according to a\nself-protective system. In this method, a multi-agent system using an\nArtificial Immune System (AIS) is employed to detect the attacking UAV and\nchoose the safest route. In the proposed ASP-UAVN, the route request packet\n(RREQ) is initially transmitted from the source UAV to the destination UAV to\ndetect the existing routes. Then, once the route reply packet (RREP) is\nreceived, a self-protective method using agents and the knowledge base is\nemployed to choose the safest route and detect the attacking UAVs. The proposed\nASP-UAVN has been validated and evaluated in two ways: simulation and\ntheoretical analysis. The results of simulation evaluation and theory analysis\nshowed that the ASP-UAS increases the Packet Delivery Rate (PDR) by more than\n17.4, 20.8, and 25.91%, and detection rate by more than 17.2, 23.1, and 29.3%,\nand decreases the Packet Loss Rate (PLR) by more than 14.4, 16.8, and 20.21%,\nthe false-positive and false-negative rate by more than 16.5, 25.3, and 31.21%\nthose of SUAS-HIS, SFA and BRUIDS methods, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jun 2020 10:12:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-17"}

In fact, they\nhave reached human parity when performing image recognition, for example.\nUnfortunately, the accuracy of these ANNs comes at the expense of a large\nnumber of cache and/or memory accesses and compute operations. Spiking Neural\nNetworks (SNNs), a type of neuromorphic, or brain-inspired network, have\nrecently gained significant interest as power-efficient alternatives to ANNs,\nbecause they are sparse, accessing very few weights, and typically only use\naddition operations instead of the more power-intensive multiply-and-accumulate\n(MAC) operations. The vast majority of neuromorphic hardware designs support\nrate-encoded SNNs, where the information is encoded in spike rates.\nRate-encoded SNNs could be seen as inefficient as an encoding scheme because it\ninvolves the transmission of a large number of spikes. A more efficient\nencoding scheme, Time-To-First-Spike (TTFS) encoding, encodes information in\nthe relative time of arrival of spikes. While TTFS-encoded SNNs are more\nefficient than rate-encoded SNNs, they have, up to now, performed poorly in\nterms of accuracy compared to previous methods. Hence, in this work, we aim to\novercome the limitations of TTFS-encoded neuromorphic systems. To accomplish\nthis, we propose: (1) a novel optimization algorithm for TTFS-encoded SNNs\nconverted from ANNs and (2) a novel hardware accelerator for TTFS-encoded SNNs,\nwith a scalable and low-power design. Overall, our work in TTFS encoding and\ntraining improves the accuracy of SNNs to achieve state-of-the-art results on\nMNIST MLPs, while reducing power consumption by 1.46$\\times$ over the\nstate-of-the-art neuromorphic hardware.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jun 2020 15:55:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 8 Nov 2020 09:10:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-11"}
