Existing automated analysis methods focus on a binary classification\nsystem (i.e., open angle or angle-closure) in a 2D AS-OCT slice. However,\nclinical diagnosis requires a more discriminating ACA three-class system (i.e.,\nopen, narrow, or synechiae angles) for the benefit of clinicians who seek\nbetter to understand the progression of the spectrum of angle-closure glaucoma\ntypes. To address this, we propose a novel sequence multi-scale aggregation\ndeep network (SMA-Net) for open-narrow-synechiae ACA classification based on an\nAS-OCT sequence. In our method, a Multi-Scale Discriminative Aggregation (MSDA)\nblock is utilized to learn the multi-scale representations at slice level,\nwhile a ConvLSTM is introduced to study the temporal dynamics of these\nrepresentations at sequence level. Finally, a multi-level loss function is used\nto combine the slice-based and sequence-based losses. The proposed method is\nevaluated across two AS-OCT datasets. The experimental results show that the\nproposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in applicability,\neffectiveness, and accuracy.

Second, ICT in general is\nexpected to be an important enabler for low-carbon economies, providing\nsolutions to reduce Green-House Gas (GHG) emissions. While the advantages of\nsustainable procurement are obvious, certain barriers hinder the adoption in\nday-to-day procurement. This case study on ICT hardware discusses the three\nimportant barriers \"lack of clear definitions per product group\", \"missing\nmarket intelligence about sustainable products\" and \"inflexible procedures and\nattitudes as barriers for innovative approaches\" based on an in-depth analysis\nof sustainable procurement of ICT hardware by the public sector in Switzerland.\nTo this end, tender data published on the national procurement platform\nsimap.ch is screened for sustainability criteria using the Common Procurement\nVocabulary (CPV) nomenclature to identify relevant ICT projects.

These\nnetworks are, most often, hierarchical and regular, and each of their nodes can\nhave an arbitrary number of child nodes. At the outset, however, the notion of\ntree network, introduced in 1936 by Belgian physicist Julien Pacotte, was quite\ndifferent: more general and, at the same time, more constrained, it should also\nserve an ambitious objective: the reconstruction of mathematics from concrete\nempirical structures.

A popular industry practice is to assume\nthat different uncertainty components within an AEP calculation are\nuncorrelated and can therefore be combined as the sum of their squares. We\nassess the practical validity of this assumption for operational-based\nuncertainty, by performing operational AEP estimates for more than 470 wind\nplants in the United States, mostly in simple terrain. We apply a Monte Carlo\napproach to quantify uncertainty in five categories: revenue meter data, wind\nspeed data, regression relationship, long-term correction, and future\ninterannual variability. We identify correlations between categories by\ncomparing the results across all 470 wind plants. We observe a positive\ncorrelation between interannual variability and the linearized long-term\ncorrection; a negative correlation between wind resource interannual\nvariability and linear regression; and a positive correlation between reference\nwind speed uncertainty and linear regression. Then, we contrast total\noperational AEP uncertainty values calculated by omitting and considering the\ncorrelations between the uncertainty components. We quantify that ignoring\nthese correlations leads to an underestimation of total AEP uncertainty of, on\naverage, 0.1%, and as large as 0.5% for specific sites. Although these are not\nlarge increases, these would still impact wind plant financing rates; further,\nwe expect these values to increase for wind plants in complex terrain. Based on\nthese results, we conclude that correlations between the identified uncertainty\ncomponents should be considered when computing the total AEP uncertainty.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2020 16:33:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-11"}

The Nagai tilt model (H. Nagai, J. Appl.

Here, however, we demonstrate how that model\nincorrectly describes how the substrate applies biaxial stress onto the\nepitaxial layer. Most importantly, the stress applied to an epitaxial layer on\na miscut substrate is not along a low index plane. For example, the surface\nplane of a nominally (001) cubic substrate with a miscut of 10{\\deg} towards\nthe [110] is the (118) plane and the stress applied is parallel along the (118)\nplane and not (001). Furthermore, under the framework of reciprocal space, the\n{00l} reflections would be symmetric reflections for on-axis substrates but\nasymmetric reflections for miscut substrates. The tilt that is experimentally\nobserved between the low index substrate planes and the epitaxial layer planes\n((001) for example with a miscut substrate) matches that which is predicted by\ntreating the low index reflections as asymmetric reflections. An epitaxial tilt\nequation is provided which describes the tilt between epitaxial and substrate\nlayers based on the lattice parameter mismatch as well as the Poisson ratio of\nthe layer that is applicable to any crystal system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2020 16:38:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}

In an effort to simulate two-dimensional subsurface\nfluid dynamics in porous media, we found that an accurate deep-learning-based\nproxy model can be taught efficiently by a computationally expensive\nfinite-volume-based simulator. We pose the problem as an image-to-image\nregression, running the simulator with different input parameters to furnish a\nsynthetic training dataset upon which we fit the deep learning models. Since\nthe data is spatiotemporal, we compare the performance of two alternative\ntreatments of time; a convolutional LSTM versus an autoencoder network that\ntreats time as a direct input. Adversarial methods are adopted to address the\nsharp spatial gradient in the fluid dynamic problems. Compared to traditional\nsimulation, the proposed deep learning approach enables much faster forward\ncomputation, which allows us to explore more scenarios with a much larger\nparameter space given the same time. It is shown that the improved forward\ncomputation efficiency is particularly valuable in solving inversion problems,\nwhere the physics model has unknown parameters to be determined by history\nmatching.

Furthermore, long\ntime-series data streams hugely increase the dimension of the target space,\nwhich may render generative modeling infeasible. To overcome these challenges,\nwe integrate GANs with mathematically principled and efficient path feature\nextraction called the signature of a path. The signature of a path is a graded\nsequence of statistics that provides a universal description for a stream of\ndata, and its expected value characterizes the law of the time-series model.

This paper focuses on the\nfeasibility of this project, i.e., whether sufficiently large numbers of QSO\nlenses are expected to be found in various concurrent and future imaging\nsurveys.

However, the lack of quantification of\nuncertainty in the estimated clusters is a disadvantage. Model-based clustering\nbased on mixture models provides an alternative, but such methods face\ncomputational problems and large sensitivity to the choice of kernel. This\narticle proposes a generalized Bayes framework that bridges between these two\nparadigms through the use of Gibbs posteriors. In conducting Bayesian updating,\nthe log likelihood is replaced by a loss function for clustering, leading to a\nrich family of clustering methods. The Gibbs posterior represents a coherent\nupdating of Bayesian beliefs without needing to specify a likelihood for the\ndata, and can be used for characterizing uncertainty in clustering. We consider\nlosses based on Bregman divergence and pairwise similarities, and develop\nefficient deterministic algorithms for point estimation along with sampling\nalgorithms for uncertainty quantification. Several existing clustering\nalgorithms, including k-means, can be interpreted as generalized Bayes\nestimators under our framework, and hence we provide a method of uncertainty\nquantification for these approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2020 18:49:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-11"}

A generalized\napproximate message passing-based method for signal reconstruction from noisy\none-bit compressed measurements is proposed, which is then extended for the\ncase where the receiver has access to a signal that aids signal reconstruction,\ni.e., side-information. Two different scenarios of side-information are\nconsidered-a) side-information consisting of support information only, and b)\nside information consisting of support and amplitude information.

Recent works have identified, through an expensive sequence of\ntraining and pruning cycles, the existence of winning lottery tickets or sparse\ntrainable subnetworks at initialization. This raises a foundational question:\ncan we identify highly sparse trainable subnetworks at initialization, without\never training, or indeed without ever looking at the data? We provide an\naffirmative answer to this question through theory driven algorithm design. We\nfirst mathematically formulate and experimentally verify a conservation law\nthat explains why existing gradient-based pruning algorithms at initialization\nsuffer from layer-collapse, the premature pruning of an entire layer rendering\na network untrainable. This theory also elucidates how layer-collapse can be\nentirely avoided, motivating a novel pruning algorithm Iterative Synaptic Flow\nPruning (SynFlow).

In this\narticle, two sensors of different radar generations are evaluated against each\nother. The evaluation criterion is the performance on moving road user object\ndetection and classification tasks. To this end, two data sets originating from\nan off-the-shelf radar and a high resolution next generation radar are\ncompared. Special attention is given on how the two data sets are assembled in\norder to make them comparable. The utilized object detector consists of a\nclustering algorithm, a feature extraction module, and a recurrent neural\nnetwork ensemble for classification. For the assessment, all components are\nevaluated both individually and, for the first time, as a whole. This allows\nfor indicating where overall performance improvements have their origin in the\npipeline. Furthermore, the generalization capabilities of both data sets are\nevaluated and important comparison metrics for automotive radar object\ndetection are discussed. Results show clear benefits of the next generation\nradar. Interestingly, those benefits do not actually occur due to better\nperformance at the classification stage, but rather because of the vast\nimprovements at the clustering stage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2020 19:51:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-03"}

Fluid antenna multiple access\n(FAMA) exploits moments of deep fade experienced by the interference to achieve\na favourable channel condition for the desired signal, without requiring\nsophisticated signal processing. We analyze the FAMA system by first deriving\nthe outage probability of the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) in a double\nintegral form.

Among these theories were the ones containing a non-minimal\nkinetic coupling correction term in the Lagrangian, which belong to a subclass\nof Horndeski theories. In this work we demonstrate how these theories may be\nrevived and we show how these theories can produce primordial gravitational\nwaves with speed $c_T^2=1$ in natural units, thus complying with the GW170817\nevent. As we show, if the gravitational action of an Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet\ntheory also contains a kinetic coupling of the form $\\sim \\xi(\\phi)\nG^{\\mu\\nu}\\partial_\\mu\\phi\\partial_\\nu\\phi$, the condition of having primordial\nmassless gravitons, or equivalently primordial gravitational waves with speed\n$c_T^2=1$ in natural units, results to certain conditions on the scalar field\ndependent coupling function of the Gauss-Bonnet term, which is also the\nnon-minimal coupling of the kinetic coupling. We extensively study the\nphenomenological implications of such a theory focusing on the inflationary\nera, by only assuming slow-roll dynamics for the scalar field. Accordingly, we\nbriefly study the case that the scalar field evolves in a constant-roll way.

The recent success of supervised\nlearning (mainly convolutional neural networks) in solving image reconstruction\nproblems suggests that it could be a fruitful approach to designing\nregularizers.

The initially circular orbit disc\nundergoes two types of eccentricity growth. First, the eccentricity oscillates\non the orbital period of the binary, $P_{\\rm orb}$, due to the eccentricity of\nthe binary orbit. Secondly, for a sufficiently small disc aspect ratio, the\ndisc undergoes global forced eccentricity oscillations on a time-scale of\naround $20\\,P_{\\rm orb}$. These oscillations damp out through viscous\ndissipation leaving a quasi-steady eccentricity profile for the disc that\noscillates only on the binary orbital period. The time-averaged global\neccentricity is in the range 0.05-0.1, with no precession in the steady state.\nThe periastrons of the gas particles are aligned to one another.

However, randomness in\nthe test statistic as a function of time makes them susceptible to false\npositives and localization ambiguity. We address these issues by deriving and\napplying filters matched to the expected temporal signatures of a change for\nvarious sliding window, two-sample tests under IID assumptions on the data.\nThese filters are derived asymptotically with respect to the window size for\nthe Wasserstein quantile test, the Wasserstein-1 distance test, Maximum Mean\nDiscrepancy squared (MMD^2), and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test. The matched\nfilters are shown to have two important properties. First, they are\ndistribution-free, and thus can be applied without prior knowledge of the\nunderlying data distributions. Second, they are peak-preserving, which allows\nthe filtered signal produced by our methods to maintain expected statistical\nsignificance. Through experiments on synthetic data as well as activity\nrecognition benchmarks, we demonstrate the utility of this approach for\nmitigating false positives and improving the test precision. Our method allows\nfor the localization of change points without the use of ad-hoc post-processing\nto remove redundant detections common to current methods. We further highlight\nthe performance of statistical tests based on the Quantile-Quantile (Q-Q)\nfunction and show how the invariance property of the Q-Q function to\norder-preserving transformations allows these tests to detect change points of\ndifferent scales with a single threshold within the same dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2020 22:45:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2020 02:55:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 2020 21:44:53 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 21:00:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-29"}

Objective: The objective of this paper is to propose guidelines on how\nto best search for evidence when updating SLRs in SE, and to evaluate these\nguidelines using an SLR that was not employed during the formulation of the\nguidelines.

Therefore, any\nterraforming attempt will require an artificial Martian magnetic shield. The\nfundamental challenge of building an artificial magnetosphere is to condense\nplanetary-scale currents and magnetic fields down to the smallest mass\npossible. Superconducting electromagnets offer a way to do this. However, the\nunderlying physics of superconductors and electromagnets limits this\nconcentration. Based upon these fundamental limitations, we show that the\namount of superconducting material is proportional to $B_c^{-2}a^{-3}$, where\n$B_c$ is the critical magnetic field for the superconductor and $a$ is the loop\nradius of a solenoid. Since $B_c$ is set by fundamental physics, the only truly\nadjustable parameter for the design is the loop radius; a larger loop radius\nminimizes the amount of superconducting material required. This non-intuitive\nresult means that the \"intuitive\" strategy of building a compact electromagnet\nand placing it between Mars and the Sun at the first Lagrange point is\nunfeasible. Considering reasonable limits on $B_c$, the smallest possible loop\nradius is $\\sim$10 km, and the magnetic shield would have a mass of $\\sim\n10^{19}$ g.

Since the texture topography cannot be rendered\nexplicitly by electrovibration on touch screens, it is important to understand\nhow we perceive the virtual textures displayed by friction modulation via\nelectrovibration. We investigated the roughness perception of real gratings\nmade of plexiglass and virtual gratings displayed by electrovibration through a\ntouch screen for comparison.

For real gratings, penetration increased tangential forces acting\non the finger, whereas for virtual ones where skin penetration is absent,\ntangential forces decreased with spatial period. Supporting our claim, we also\nfound that increasing normal force increases the perceived roughness of real\ngratings while it causes an opposite effect for the virtual gratings.

The analysis is extended to multiple UAVs and a new packing scheme is\nproposed for multiple UAVs coverage that offers several advantages compared to\nprior approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2020 23:34:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-11"}

In thin flux tube models the Coriolis force causes Joy's law, acting on\neast-west flows as they rise towards the surface. Our goal is to measure the\nevolution of the average tilt angle of hundreds of active regions as they\nemerge, so that we can constrain the origins of Joy's law. We measured the tilt\nangle of the primary bipoles in 153 emerging active regions in the Solar\nDynamics Observatory Helioseismic Emerging Active Region survey. We used\nline-of-sight magnetic field measurements averaged over 6 hours to define the\npolarities and measure the tilt angle up to four days after emergence. We find\nthat at the time of emergence the polarities are on average aligned east-west,\nand that neither the separation nor the tilt depends on latitude. We do find,\nhowever, that ARs at higher latitudes have a faster north-south separation\nspeed than those closer to the equator at the emergence time. After emergence,\nthe tilt angle increases and Joy's law is evident about two days later. The\nscatter in the tilt angle is independent of flux until about one day after\nemergence, when higher-flux regions have a smaller scatter in tilt angle than\nlower-flux regions. Our finding that active regions emerge with an east-west\nalignment is surprising since thin flux tube models predict that tilt angles of\nrising flux tubes are generated below the surface. Previously reported tilt\nangle relaxation of deeply anchored flux tubes can be largely explained by the\nchange in east-west separation. We conclude that Joy's law is caused by an\ninherent north-south separation speed present when the flux first reaches the\nsurface, and that the scatter in the tilt angle is consistent with buffeting of\nthe polarities by supergranulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jun 2020 00:04:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

We quantitatively analysed the\nmultifaceted impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our societies including\npeople's mobility, health, and social behaviour changes. People's mobility has\nchanged significantly due to the implementation of travel restriction and\nquarantine measurements. Indeed, the physical distance has widened at\ninternational (cross-border), national and regional level. At international\nlevel, due to the travel restrictions, the number of international flights has\nplunged overall at around 88 percent during March. In particular, the number of\nflights connecting Europe dropped drastically in mid of March after the United\nStates announced travel restrictions to Europe and the EU and participating\ncountries agreed to close borders, at 84 percent decline compared to March\n10th. Similarly, we examined the impacts of quarantine measures in the major\ncity: Tokyo (Japan), New York City (the United States), and Barcelona (Spain).\nWithin all three cities, we found the significant decline in traffic volume. We\nalso identified the increased concern for mental health through the analysis of\nposts on social networking services such as Twitter and Instagram.

Standard\nrandomized controlled trials are typically not feasible, since the goal is to\nestimate policy performance on the entire system. Instead, the typical current\npractice involves dynamically alternating between the two policies for fixed\nlengths of time, and comparing the average performance of each over the\nintervals in which they were run as an estimate of the treatment effect.\nHowever, this approach suffers from *temporal interference*: one algorithm\nalters the state of the system as seen by the second algorithm, biasing\nestimates of the treatment effect. Further, the simple non-adaptive nature of\nsuch designs implies they are not sample efficient.\n  We develop a benchmark theoretical model in which to study optimal\nexperimental design for this setting. We view testing the two policies as the\nproblem of estimating the steady state difference in reward between two unknown\nMarkov chains (i.e., policies). We assume estimation of the steady state reward\nfor each chain proceeds via nonparametric maximum likelihood, and search for\nconsistent (i.e., asymptotically unbiased) experimental designs that are\nefficient (i.e., asymptotically minimum variance). Characterizing such designs\nis equivalent to a Markov decision problem with a minimum variance objective;\nsuch problems generally do not admit tractable solutions. Remarkably, in our\nsetting, using a novel application of classical martingale analysis of Markov\nchains via Poisson's equation, we characterize efficient designs via a succinct\nconvex optimization problem. We use this characterization to propose a\nconsistent, efficient online experimental design that adaptively samples the\ntwo Markov chains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jun 2020 01:07:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 24 Dec 2022 16:15:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-27"}

The unique hypervector\nrepresentation enables HDC classifiers to exhibit high energy efficiency, low\ninference latency and strong robustness against hardware-induced bit errors.\nConsequently, they have been increasingly recognized as an appealing\nalternative to or even replacement of traditional deep neural networks (DNNs)\nfor local on device classification, especially on low-power Internet of Things\ndevices. Nonetheless, unlike their DNN counterparts, state-of-the-art designs\nfor HDC classifiers are mostly security-oblivious, casting doubt on their\nsafety and immunity to adversarial inputs. In this paper, we study for the\nfirst time adversarial attacks on HDC classifiers and highlight that HDC\nclassifiers can be vulnerable to even minimally-perturbed adversarial samples.\nConcretely, using handwritten digit classification as an example, we construct\na HDC classifier and formulate a grey-box attack problem, where an attacker's\ngoal is to mislead the target HDC classifier to produce erroneous prediction\nlabels while keeping the amount of added perturbation noise as little as\npossible. Then, we propose a modified genetic algorithm to generate adversarial\nsamples within a reasonably small number of queries. Our results show that\nadversarial images generated by our algorithm can successfully mislead the HDC\nclassifier to produce wrong prediction labels with a high probability (i.e.,\n78% when the HDC classifier uses a fixed majority rule for decision). Finally,\nwe also present two defense strategies -- adversarial training and retraining--\nto strengthen the security of HDC classifiers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jun 2020 01:09:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-11"}

For a given initial\nmarking, the set of potentially reachable markings is described by the state\nequation solutions and over-approximates the set of reachable markings.\n  In this paper, we delineate several subclasses of weighted Petri nets in\nwhich the set of reachable markings equals the set of potentially reachable\nones, a property we call the PR-R equality. When fulfilled, this property\nallows to use linear algebra to answer the reachability questions, avoiding a\nbrute-force analysis of the state space. Notably, we provide conditions under\nwhich this equality holds in classes much more expressive than marked graphs,\nadding places with several ingoing and outgoing transitions, which allows to\nmodel real applications with shared buffers. To achieve it, we investigate the\nrelationship between liveness, reversibility, boundedness and potential\nreachability in Petri nets. We also show that this equality does not hold in\nclasses with close modeling capability when the conditions are relaxed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jun 2020 01:26:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-11"}

Existing\nalgorithms of MS-UDA either only exploit the shared features, i.e., the\ndomain-invariant information, or based on some weak assumption in NLP, e.g.,\nsmoothness assumption. To avoid these problems, we propose two transfer\nlearning frameworks based on the multi-source domain adaptation methodology for\nSA by combining the source hypotheses to derive a good target hypothesis. The\nkey feature of the first framework is a novel Weighting Scheme based\nUnsupervised Domain Adaptation framework (WS-UDA), which combine the source\nclassifiers to acquire pseudo labels for target instances directly. While the\nsecond framework is a Two-Stage Training based Unsupervised Domain Adaptation\nframework (2ST-UDA), which further exploits these pseudo labels to train a\ntarget private extractor. Importantly, the weights assigned to each source\nclassifier are based on the relations between target instances and source\ndomains, which measured by a discriminator through the adversarial training.\nFurthermore, through the same discriminator, we also fulfill the separation of\nshared features and private features.

This measure helps comparing histograms of four patches,\ncorresponding to geographical zones, that are influenced by atmospheric\nstructures.

We\nuse local three-dimensional simulations of the vertically-stratified,\nself-gravitating, differentially-rotating, interstellar medium (ISM) subject to\na stellar spiral potential to study the effects of spiral arms on star\nformation and formation of arm spurs/feathers. We adopt the TIGRESS framework\nof Kim & Ostriker (2017) to handle radiative heating and cooling, star\nformation, and ensuing supernova (SN) feedback. We find that more than 90% of\nstar formation takes place in spiral arms, but the global star formation rate\n(SFR) in models with spiral arms is enhanced by less than a factor of 2\ncompared to the no-arm counterpart. This results from a quasi-linear\nrelationship between the SFR surface density Sigma_SFR and the gas surface\ndensity Sigma, and supports the picture that spiral arms do not trigger star\nformation but rather concentrate star-forming regions. Correlated SN feedback\nproduces gaseous spurs/feathers downstream from arms in both magnetized and\nunmagnetized models. These spurs/feathers are short-lived and have magnetic\nfields parallel to their length, in contrast to the longer-lived features with\nperpendicular magnetic fields induced by gravitational instability. SN feedback\ndrives the turbulent component of magnetic fields, with the total magnetic\nfield strength sublinearly proportional to Sigma.

To build a prediction model in real\nsituations, learning from biased observational data is a critical issue due to\nthe lack of randomized controlled trial (RCT) data. To handle such biased\nobservational data, recent efforts in causal inference and counterfactual\nmachine learning have focused on debiased estimation of the potential outcomes\non a binary action space and the difference between them, namely, the\nindividual treatment effect. When it comes to a large action space (e.g.,\nselecting an appropriate combination of medicines for a patient), however, the\nregression accuracy of the potential outcomes is no longer sufficient in\npractical terms to achieve a good decision-making performance. This is because\nthe mean accuracy on the large action space does not guarantee the nonexistence\nof a single potential outcome misestimation that might mislead the whole\ndecision. Our proposed loss minimizes a classification error of whether or not\nthe action is relatively good for the individual target among all feasible\nactions, which further improves the decision-making performance, as we prove.\nWe also propose a network architecture and a regularizer that extracts a\ndebiased representation not only from the individual feature but also from the\nbiased action for better generalization in large action spaces.

For most portfolios of\ninsurance claims, there is typically a large proportion of zero claims that\nleads to imbalances resulting in inferior prediction accuracy of these\ntraditional approaches. This article proposes the use of tree-based models with\na hybrid structure that involves a two-step algorithm as an alternative\napproach to these traditional models. The first step is the construction of a\nclassification tree to build the probability model for frequency. In the second\nstep, we employ elastic net regression models at each terminal node from the\nclassification tree to build the distribution model for severity. This hybrid\nstructure captures the benefits of tuning hyperparameters at each step of the\nalgorithm; this allows for improved prediction accuracy and tuning can be\nperformed to meet specific business objectives. We examine and compare the\npredictive performance of such a hybrid tree-based structure in relation to the\ntraditional Tweedie model using both real and synthetic datasets. Our empirical\nresults show that these hybrid tree-based models produce more accurate\npredictions without the loss of intuitive interpretation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jun 2020 02:21:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-11"}

This region of the parameter space has\nnot been included in previous surveys, but it might present the biggest\nchallenge for theoretical models and it might be a large contributor to\nfeedback due to the outflows' potentially large kinetic power. Using the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey, we find 40 quasar spectra with broad EHVO CIV absorption,\n10 times more than the number of previously known cases. We characterize the\nEHVO absorption and find that in 26 cases, CIV is accompanied by NV and/or OVI\nabsorption. We find that EHVO quasars lack HeII emission and have overall\nlarger bolometric luminosities and black hole masses than those of their parent\nsample and BALQSOs, while we do not find significant differences in their\nEddington ratios. We also report a trend toward larger black hole masses as the\nvelocity of the outflowing gas increases in the BALQSOs in our sample. The\noverall larger Lbol and lack of HeII emission of EHVO quasars suggest that\nradiation is likely driving these outflows. We find a potential evolutionary\neffect as EHVO quasars seem to be more predominant at large redshifts. We\nestimate that the kinetic power of these outflows may be similar to or even\nlarger than that of the outflows from BALQSOs as the velocity factor increases\nthis parameter by 1-2.5 orders of magnitude. Further study of EHVO quasars will\nhelp improve our understanding of quasar physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jun 2020 03:17:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

Both industry and academy have\npaid much attention to this topic and propose different approaches to modeling\nwith long sequential user behavior data. Among them, memory network based model\nMIMN proposed by Alibaba, achieves SOTA with the co-design of both learning\nalgorithm and serving system. MIMN is the first industrial solution that can\nmodel sequential user behavior data with length scaling up to 1000. However,\nMIMN fails to precisely capture user interests given a specific candidate item\nwhen the length of user behavior sequence increases further, say, by 10 times\nor more. This challenge exists widely in previously proposed approaches. In\nthis paper, we tackle this problem by designing a new modeling paradigm, which\nwe name as Search-based Interest Model (SIM). SIM extracts user interests with\ntwo cascaded search units: (i) General Search Unit acts as a general search\nfrom the raw and arbitrary long sequential behavior data, with query\ninformation from candidate item, and gets a Sub user Behavior Sequence which is\nrelevant to candidate item; (ii) Exact Search Unit models the precise\nrelationship between candidate item and SBS. This cascaded search paradigm\nenables SIM with a better ability to model lifelong sequential behavior data in\nboth scalability and accuracy.

Investigation of this problem in the quantum setting was initiated by\nNayebi, Aaronson, Belovs, and Trevisan (2015), who proved a lower bound of\n$ST^2 = \\tilde\\Omega(N)$ for random permutations against classical advice,\nleaving open an intriguing possibility that Grover's search can be sped up to\ntime $\\tilde O(\\sqrt{N/S})$. Recent works by Hhan, Xagawa, and Yamakawa (2019),\nand Chung, Liao, and Qian (2019) extended the argument for random functions and\nquantum advice, but the lower bound remains $ST^2 = \\tilde\\Omega(N)$.\n  In this work, we prove that even with quantum advice, $ST + T^2 =\n\\tilde\\Omega(N)$ is required for an algorithm to invert random functions. This\ndemonstrates that Grover's search is optimal for $S = \\tilde O(\\sqrt{N})$,\nruling out any substantial speed-up for Grover's search even with quantum\nadvice. Further improvements to our bounds would imply new classical circuit\nlower bounds, as shown by Corrigan-Gibbs and Kogan (2019).\n  To prove this result, we develop a general framework for establishing quantum\ntime-space lower bounds. We further demonstrate the power of our framework by\nproving quantum time-space lower bounds for Yao's box problem and salted\ncryptography.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jun 2020 04:23:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 22 Nov 2020 19:44:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-24"}

However, the SAFT fails in\nobtaining the local features of non-transient signals due to its global kernel\nand thereby make SAFT incompetent in situations demanding joint information of\ntime and frequency. To circumvent this limitation, we propose a highly flexible\ntime-frequency transform namely, the special affine wavelet transform (SAWT)\nand investigate the associated constant $Q$-property in the joint\ntime-frequency domain. The basic properties of the proposed transform such as\nRayleigh's theorem, inversion formula and characterization of the range are\ndiscussed using the machinery of special affine Fourier transforms and operator\ntheory. Besides this, the discrete counterpart of SAWT is also discussed and\nthe corresponding reconstruction formula is obtained. Moreover, we also drive a\ndirect relationship between the well known special affine Wigner distribution\nand the proposed transform. This is followed by introducing a new kind of wave\npacket transform associated with the special affine Fourier transform. Towards\nthe end, an analogue of the Poisson summation formula for the proposed special\naffine wavelet transform is derived.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jun 2020 05:08:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-11"}

In this model dynein motors are attached to the cell cortex and\nplus-ended motors resembling kinesin-5 diffuse in the cell interior. The\nintroduction of 'noise' in the form of MT length fluctuations spontaneously\nresults in the emergence of coordinated, achiral vortex-like rotation of\nasters. The coherence and persistence of rotation requires a threshold density\nof both cortical dyneins and coupling kinesins, while the onset of rotation if\ndiffusion-limited with relation to cortical dynein mobility. The coordinated\nrotational motion arises due to the resolution of the 'tug-of-war' of the\nrotational component due to cortical motors by 'noise' in the form of MT\ndynamic instability, and such transient symmetry breaking is amplified by local\ncoupling by kinesin-5 complexes.

The thermal rotating shallow water (TRSW) model equations contain\nthree small nondimensional parameters. These are the Rossby number, the Froude\nnumber and the buoyancy parameter. Asymptotic expansion of the TRSW model\nequations in these three small parameters leads to the deterministic thermal\nversions of the Salmon's L1 (TL1) model and the thermal quasi-geostrophic (TQG)\nmodel, upon expanding in the neighbourhood of thermal quasi-geostrophic balance\namong the flow velocity and the gradients of free surface elevation and\nbuoyancy.

This\napproach yields satisfying results in case that the background measurements are\ntaken in close proximity to the particle measurement and when the background\nsignal drifts linearly. In this work, we propose a joint estimation of particle\ndistribution and background signal based on a dictionary that is capable of\nrepresenting typical background signals and allows for precise estimation of\nthe background even when the latter is drifting non-linearly over time. Using a\nsingular-value decomposition, the dictionary is derived from a large number of\nbackground calibration scans that do not need to be recorded in close proximity\nto the particle measurement.

A major focus in this\npaper is on data collection which can be more cumbersome than most people might\nexpect. Also data quality for machine learning applications is a challenge once\nleaving the laboratory. In this area one has to expect the lack of semantic\ndescription of the data as well as very little ground truth being available for\ntraining and verification of machine learning models. A last challenge is IT\nsecurity and passing data through firewalls.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jun 2020 10:05:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-27"}

We carried out a non-LTE analysis using a Large Velocity\nGradient (LVG) code to model the single-dish observations. From our\nobservations we can show that (i) the (2-1) transition of the main isotopologue\nis optically thick in L1157-B1 even at high velocities, and (ii) the\n[$^{29}$SiO/$^{30}$SiO] ratio is constant across the source, and consistent\nwith the solar value of 1.5. We report the first isotopic fractionation maps of\nSiO in a shocked region and show the absence of a mass dependent fractionation\nin $^{29}$Si and $^{30}$Si across L1157-B1. A high-velocity bullet in\n$^{28}$SiO has been identified, showing the signature of a jet impacting on the\ndense gas. With the dataset presented in this paper, both interferometric and\nsingle-dish, we were able to study in great detail the gas shocked at the B1a\nposition and its surrounding gas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jun 2020 11:02:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-19"}

Casting sequential\nrecommendation task as a reinforcement learning (RL) problem is a promising\ndirection. A major component of RL approaches is to train the agent through\ninteractions with the environment. However, it is often problematic to train a\nrecommender in an on-line fashion due to the requirement to expose users to\nirrelevant recommendations. As a result, learning the policy from logged\nimplicit feedback is of vital importance, which is challenging due to the pure\noff-policy setting and lack of negative rewards (feedback). In this paper, we\npropose self-supervised reinforcement learning for sequential recommendation\ntasks. Our approach augments standard recommendation models with two output\nlayers: one for self-supervised learning and the other for RL. The RL part acts\nas a regularizer to drive the supervised layer focusing on specific\nrewards(e.g., recommending items which may lead to purchases rather than\nclicks) while the self-supervised layer with cross-entropy loss provides strong\ngradient signals for parameter updates. Based on such an approach, we propose\ntwo frameworks namely Self-Supervised Q-learning(SQN) and Self-Supervised\nActor-Critic(SAC). We integrate the proposed frameworks with four\nstate-of-the-art recommendation models. Experimental results on two real-world\ndatasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jun 2020 11:18:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 2020 09:36:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-12"}

Chemical vapour deposition is among the most promising methods to\nfulfill these requirements. However, for 2D materials prepared in this way it\nis generally assumed that they are of inferior quality in comparison to the\nexfoliated 2D materials commonly used in basic research. In this work we\nchallenge this assumption and aim to quantify the differences in quality for\nthe prototypical transition metal dichalcogenide MoS$_2$. To this end single\nlayers of MoS$_2$ prepared by different techniques (exfoliation, grown by\ndifferent chemical vapor deposition methods, transfer techniques, and as\nvertical heterostructure with graphene) are studied by Raman and\nphotoluminescence spectroscopy, complemented by atomic force microscopy. We\ndemonstrate that as-prepared MoS$_2$, directly grown on SiO$_2$, differs from\nexfoliated MoS$_2$ in terms of higher photoluminescence, lower electron\nconcentration, and increased strain. As soon as a water film is intercalated\n(e.g., by transfer) underneath the grown MoS$_2$, in particular the\n(opto-)electronic properties become practically identical to those of\nexfoliated MoS$_2$. A comparison of the two most common precursors shows that\nthe growth with MoO$_3$ causes greater strain and/or defect density deviations\nthan growth with ammonium heptamolybdate. As part of a heterostructure directly\ngrown MoS$_2$ interacts much stronger with the substrate, and in this case an\nintercalated water film does not lead to the complete decoupling, which is\ntypical for exfoliation or transfer. Our work shows that the supposedly poorer\nquality of grown 2D transition metal dichalcogenides is indeed a misconception.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jun 2020 11:58:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-28"}

Extensive studies in quantum vortex\nreconnection show that the minimum separation distance {\\delta} between\ninteracting vortices follows a 1/2 scaling. Due to the complex nature of the\ndynamics (e.g., the formation of bridges and threads as well as successive\nreconnections and avalanche), such scaling has never been reported for\n(classical) viscous vortex reconnection. Using the direct numerical simulation\nof the Navier-Stokes equations, we study viscous reconnection of slender\nvortices, whose core size is much smaller than the radius of the vortex\ncurvature. For separations that are large compared to the vortex core size, we\ndiscover that {\\delta}(t) between the two interacting viscous vortices\nsurprisingly also follows the 1/2 power scaling for both pre- and\npost-reconnection events. The prefactors in this 1/2-power law are found to\ndepend not only on the initial configuration but also on the vortex Reynolds\nnumber (or viscosity). Our finding in the viscous reconnection, complementing\nnumerous works on quantum vortex reconnection, suggests that there is indeed a\nuniversal route for reconnection -- an essential result for understanding the\nvarious facets of the viscous vortex reconnection phenomena and their potential\nmodeling, as well as possibly explaining turbulence cascade physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jun 2020 12:26:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-12"}

The perpendicular structure of wave field along this\nshuttle is given in terms of stream vector plots, showing significant change\nfrom midplane to ending throats, and the vector field rotates and forms a\ncircular layer that separating plasma column radially into core and edge\nregions near the throats. The influences of driving frequency, plasma density\nand field strength on the wave field and power absorption are computed in\ndetail. It is found that the wave magnitude and power absorption decrease for\nincreased driving frequency and reduced field strength, and maximize around a\ncertain level of plasma density. The axial standing-wave feature always exists,\ndue to the interference between forward and reflected waves from ending\nmagnetic mirrors, while the radial wave field structure largely stays the same.\nDistributions of wave energy density and power absorption density all show\nshrinking feature from midplane to ending throats, which is consistent with the\nnature of helicon mode that propagating along field lines. Theoretical analysis\nbased on a simple magnetic shuttle and the governing equation of helicon waves\nshows consistency with computed results and previous studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jun 2020 13:07:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-11"}

This\nproject brings together new opportunities and new challenges, both from a\ntechnical and economic point of view.

First,\nwe perform a techno-economic assessment of different grid configurations for\nthe collection of the power produced by wind farms and its transmission to the\nhub. In this analysis, two frequencies and two voltage levels for the operation\nof the offshore grid are investigated. Our findings show that the\nnominal-frequency high-voltage option is the more suitable, as low-frequency\ndoes not bring any advantage and low-voltage would results in higher costs. The\nsecond analysis is related to the differences in operating the system with low-\nor zero-inertia; different dynamic studies are performed for each configuration\nto identify proper control actions and their stability properties. Comparing\nthe outcomes of the simulations, we observed that voltage and frequency\noscillations are better damped in the zero-inertia system; however, the risk of\npropagating offshore faults in the connected onshore grids is mitigated with\nthe inclusion of the synchronous condensers. Lastly, a comparison of\nElectroMagnetic Transient (EMT) and phasor-mode (also known as RMS) models is\npresented, in order to understand their appropriateness of simulating low- and\nzero- inertia systems. The results show that phasor approximation modelling can\nbe used, as long as eigen-frequencies in power network are well damped.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jun 2020 13:35:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-11"}

Despite their advantages, such as\nstability in training, the performance of AE based models has not reached the\nsuperior standards as that of the other generative models such as Generative\nAdversarial Networks (GANs). Motivated by this, we examine the effect of the\nlatent prior on the generation quality of deterministic AE models in this\npaper. Specifically, we consider the class of RAEs with deterministic\nEncoder-Decoder pairs, Wasserstein Auto-Encoders (WAE), and show that having a\nfixed prior distribution, \\textit{a priori}, oblivious to the dimensionality of\nthe `true' latent space, will lead to the infeasibility of the optimization\nproblem considered.

As a remedy to both the issues\nmentioned above, we introduce an additional state space in the form of flexibly\nlearnable latent priors, in the optimization objective of the WAEs. We\nimplicitly learn the distribution of the latent prior jointly with the AE\ntraining, which not only makes the learning objective feasible but also\nfacilitates operation on different points of the bias-variance curve.

Our model departs from the existing literature by\ndescribing a public-private insurance intended to relieve the financial burden\nthat natural events place on governments, while at the same time assisting\nindividuals and protecting the insurance business. Hence, the business is\naiming at maximizing social welfare rather than profits. Given the limited\namount of data available on natural risks, expected losses per individual have\nbeen estimated through risk-modeling. In order to evaluate the insurer's loss\nprofile, spatial correlation among insured assets has been evaluated by means\nof the Hoeffding bound for r-dependent random variables. Though earthquakes\ngenerate expected losses that are almost six times greater than floods, we\nfound that the amount of public funds needed to manage the two perils is almost\nthe same. We argue that this result is determined by a combination of the risk\naversion of individuals and the shape of the loss distribution. Lastly, since\nearthquakes and floods are uncorrelated, we tested whether jointly managing the\ntwo perils can counteract the negative impact of spatial correlation. Some\nbenefit from risk diversification emerged, though the probability of the\ngovernment having to inject further capital might be considerable. Our findings\nsuggest that, when not supported by the government, private insurance might\neither financially over-expose the insurer or set premiums so high that\nindividuals would fail to purchase policies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jun 2020 14:06:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-11"}

This is because an NVM requires high voltage and current to\naccess its synaptic weight, which further accelerates the circuit aging in a\nneuromorphic hardware. Current methods for qualifying reliability are overly\nconservative, since they estimate circuit aging considering worst-case\noperating conditions and unnecessarily constrain performance. This paper\nproposes RENEU, a reliability-oriented approach to map machine learning\napplications to neuromorphic hardware, with the aim of improving system-wide\nreliability without compromising key performance metrics such as execution time\nof these applications on the hardware. Fundamental to RENEU is a novel\nformulation of the aging of CMOS-based circuits in a neuromorphic hardware\nconsidering different failure mechanisms. Using this formulation, RENEU\ndevelops a system-wide reliability model which can be used inside a\ndesign-space exploration framework involving the mapping of neurons and\nsynapses to the hardware. To this end, RENEU uses an instance of Particle Swarm\nOptimization (PSO) to generate mappings that are Pareto-optimal in terms of\nperformance and reliability. We evaluate RENEU using different machine learning\napplications on a state-of-the-art neuromorphic hardware with NVM synapses. Our\nresults demonstrate an average 38\\% reduction in circuit aging, leading to an\naverage 18% improvement in the lifetime of the hardware compared to current\npractices.

This level of classification accuracy will help to alleviate some\ncommon smart bin problems, such as recycling contamination, where different\ntypes of waste become mixed with recycling waste causing the bin to be\ncontaminated.

At the same time, it decreases with\nincreasing problem dimension, indicating that the advantages of the crossover\nare not visible in the asymptotic view classically applied in runtime analysis.\nWe therefore argue that a mathematical investigation for fixed dimensions might\nhelp us observe effects which are not visible when focusing exclusively on\nasymptotic performance bounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jun 2020 15:22:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-16"}

We formulate, formally analyze, and provide an efficient solution\nto an optimization problem, allowing identification of the optimal set of\nsignal boundaries and byte orderings. We provide two novel, state-of-the-art\nsignal boundary classifiers-both superior to previous approaches in precision\nand recall in three different test scenarios-and the first signedness\nclassification algorithm which exhibits a $>$97\\% F-score. CAN-D is the only\nsolution with the potential to extract any CAN signal. In evaluation on 10\nvehicles, CAN-D's average $\\ell^1$ error is 5x better than all previous methods\nand exhibits lower ave. error, even when considering only signals that meet\nprior methods' assumptions. CAN-D is implemented in lightweight hardware,\nallowing for an OBD-II plugin for real-time in-vehicle CAN decoding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2020 22:32:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Jun 2021 03:50:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-24"}

This work presents an approach\nto learn neural driving policies from real world driving demonstration data. We\nmodel human driving as a sequential decision making problem that is\ncharacterized by non-linearity and stochasticity, and unknown underlying cost\nfunctions. Imitation learning is an approach for generating intelligent\nbehavior when the cost function is unknown or difficult to specify. Building\nupon work in inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), Generative Adversarial\nImitation Learning (GAIL) aims to provide effective imitation even for problems\nwith large or continuous state and action spaces, such as modeling human\ndriving. This article describes the use of GAIL for learning-based driver\nmodeling. Because driver modeling is inherently a multi-agent problem, where\nthe interaction between agents needs to be modeled, this paper describes a\nparameter-sharing extension of GAIL called PS-GAIL to tackle multi-agent driver\nmodeling. In addition, GAIL is domain agnostic, making it difficult to encode\nspecific knowledge relevant to driving in the learning process. This paper\ndescribes Reward Augmented Imitation Learning (RAIL), which modifies the reward\nsignal to provide domain-specific knowledge to the agent. Finally, human\ndemonstrations are dependent upon latent factors that may not be captured by\nGAIL. This paper describes Burn-InfoGAIL, which allows for disentanglement of\nlatent variability in demonstrations. Imitation learning experiments are\nperformed using NGSIM, a real-world highway driving dataset. Experiments show\nthat these modifications to GAIL can successfully model highway driving\nbehavior, accurately replicating human demonstrations and generating realistic,\nemergent behavior in the traffic flow arising from the interaction between\ndriving agents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jun 2020 05:47:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Feb 2023 12:35:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-08"}

This non-parametric approach is compared\nto a semi-parametric data generator based on generalized additive models and\nthat uses prior knowledge of energy consumption. Experiments in a publicly\navailable data set show that, the proposed method presents comparable\nperformance to the semi-parametric one when it comes to generating the average\nvalue of the original data. The main contribution from this new method is the\ncapacity to reproduce rebound and side effects in the generated consumption\nprofiles. Indeed, the application of a special electricity tariff over a time\nwindow may also affect consumption outside this time window. Another\ncontribution is that the clustering approach segments consumers according to\ntheir daily consumption profile and elasticity to tariff changes. These two\nresults combined are very relevant for an ex-ante testing of future DR policies\nby system operators, retailers and energy regulators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jun 2020 08:05:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-15"}

These algorithms treat all items being\nshuffled equally regardless of how similar the items are to each other. While\nthis may be desirable for many applications, this is problematic for shuffle\nplay due to the clustering illusion, which is the tendency for humans to\nerroneously consider 'streaks' or 'clusters' that may arise from samplings of\nrandom distributions to be non-random. This thesis attempts to address this\nissue with a family of biased shuffling algorithms called cluster diffusing\n(CD) shuffles which are based on disordered hyperuniform systems such as the\ndistribution of cone cells in chicken eyes, the energy levels of heavy atomic\nnuclei, the eigenvalue distributions of various types of random matrices, and\nmany others which appear in a variety of biological, chemical, physical, and\nmathematical settings. These systems suppress density fluctuations at large\nlength scales without appearing ordered like lattices, making them ideal for\nshuffle play. The CD shuffles range from a random matrix based shuffle which\ntakes $O(n^3)$ time and $O(n^2)$ space to more efficient approximations which\ntake $O(n)$ time and $O(n)$ space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jun 2020 03:21:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-18"}
