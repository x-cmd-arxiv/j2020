The minimum number of colors needed to\nrainbow-connect a graph $G$ is the rainbow connection number of $G$, denoted by\n$\\text{rc}(G)$.\n  A simple way to rainbow-connect a graph $G$ is to color the edges of a\nspanning tree with distinct colors and then re-use any of these colors to color\nthe remaining edges of $G$. This proves that $\\text{rc}(G) \\le |V(G)|-1$. We\nask whether there is a stronger connection between tree-like structures and\nrainbow coloring than that is implied by the above trivial argument.

Most of existing works tackle the closed-set scenario, assuming that the\nsource and target domains share the exactly same categories. In practice,\nnevertheless, a target domain often contains samples of classes unseen in\nsource domain (i.e., unknown class). The extension of domain adaptation from\nclosed-set to such open-set situation is not trivial since the target samples\nin unknown class are not expected to align with the source. In this paper, we\naddress this problem by augmenting the state-of-the-art domain adaptation\ntechnique, Self-Ensembling, with category-agnostic clusters in target domain.\nSpecifically, we present Self-Ensembling with Category-agnostic Clusters\n(SE-CC) -- a novel architecture that steers domain adaptation with the\nadditional guidance of category-agnostic clusters that are specific to target\ndomain. These clustering information provides domain-specific visual cues,\nfacilitating the generalization of Self-Ensembling for both closed-set and\nopen-set scenarios. Technically, clustering is firstly performed over all the\nunlabeled target samples to obtain the category-agnostic clusters, which reveal\nthe underlying data space structure peculiar to target domain. A clustering\nbranch is capitalized on to ensure that the learnt representation preserves\nsuch underlying structure by matching the estimated assignment distribution\nover clusters to the inherent cluster distribution for each target sample.\nFurthermore, SE-CC enhances the learnt representation with mutual information\nmaximization. Extensive experiments are conducted on Office and VisDA datasets\nfor both open-set and closed-set domain adaptation, and superior results are\nreported when comparing to the state-of-the-art approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 2020 16:19:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-12"}

In the view of extremely expensive expert labeling, recent\nresearch has shown that the models trained on photo-realistic synthetic data\n(e.g., computer games) with computer-generated annotations can be adapted to\nreal images. Despite this progress, without constraining the prediction on real\nimages, the models will easily overfit on synthetic data due to severe domain\nmismatch. In this paper, we novelly exploit the intrinsic properties of\nsemantic segmentation to alleviate such problem for model transfer.\nSpecifically, we present a Regularizer of Prediction Transfer (RPT) that\nimposes the intrinsic properties as constraints to regularize model transfer in\nan unsupervised fashion. These constraints include patch-level, cluster-level\nand context-level semantic prediction consistencies at different levels of\nimage formation.

Changes in the wind properties alter its shielding\nand affect the SED striking the BLR, producing the observed decorrelations. In\nthis work, we investigate the impact of a translucent wind on the emission\nlines. We simulate the obscuration using XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, and HST\nobservations to determine the physical characteristics of the wind. We find\nthat a translucent wind can contribute a part of the He II and Fe K? emission.\nIt has a modest optical depth to electron scattering, which explains the\nfainter far-side emission in the observed velocity delay maps. The wind\nproduces the very broad base seen in the UV emission lines and may also be\npresent in the Fe K? line. Our results highlight the importance of accounting\nfor the effects of such winds in the analysis of the physics of the central\nengine.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 2020 17:15:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-12"}

Tracking the abundance\nof visually identifiable, early-successional species enables successional\nstatus and thereby restoration progress to be evaluated. Here we present a new\npipeline, SLIC-UAV, for processing Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) imagery to map\nearly-successional species in tropical forests. The pipeline is novel because\nit comprises: (a) a time-efficient approach for labelling crowns from UAV\nimagery; (b) machine learning of species based on spectral and textural\nfeatures within individual tree crowns, and (c) automatic segmentation of\northomosaiced UAV imagery into 'superpixels', using Simple Linear Iterative\nClustering (SLIC). Creating superpixels reduces the dataset's dimensionality\nand focuses prediction onto clusters of pixels, greatly improving accuracy. To\ndemonstrate SLIC-UAV, support vector machines and random forests were used to\npredict the species of hand-labelled crowns in a restoration concession in\nIndonesia. Random forests were most accurate at discriminating species for\nwhole crowns, with accuracy ranging from 79.3% when mapping five common\nspecies, to 90.5% when mapping the three most visually-distinctive species. In\ncontrast, support vector machines proved better for labelling automatically\nsegmented superpixels, with accuracy ranging from 74.3% to 91.7% for the same\nspecies. Models were extended to map species across 100 hectares of forest. The\nstudy demonstrates the power of SLIC-UAV for mapping characteristic\nearly-successional tree species as an indicator of successional stage within\ntropical forest restoration areas.

The M-SRPT\nalgorithm is proved to achieve a competitive ratio of $\\Theta(\\log \\alpha\n+\\beta)$ for minimizing response time, where $\\alpha$ denotes the ratio between\nmaximum job workload and minimum job workload, $\\beta$ represents the ratio\nbetween maximum non-preemptive task workload and minimum job workload. In\naddition, the competitive ratio achieved is shown to be optimal (up to a\nconstant factor), when there are constant number of machines. We further\nconsider the problem under Poisson arrival and general workload distribution\n(\\ie, M/GI/$N$ system), and show that M-SRPT achieves asymptotic optimal mean\nresponse time when the traffic intensity $\\rho$ approaches $1$, if job size\ndistribution has finite support. Beyond finite job workload, the asymptotic\noptimality of M-SRPT also holds for infinite job size distributions with\ncertain probabilistic assumptions, for example, M/M/$N$ system with finite task\nworkload. As a special case, we show that M-SRPT is asymptotic optimal in\nM/M/$1$ model, in which the task size distribution is allowed to have infinite\nsupport.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 2020 17:27:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Sep 2020 12:17:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 3 Oct 2020 07:40:29 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2020 11:08:50 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sat, 24 Oct 2020 07:03:28 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Fri, 15 Jan 2021 08:36:09 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Sun, 19 Jun 2022 02:07:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

Understanding how MBH\nbinary spins evolve is crucial for determining their recoil velocities, their\ngravitational wave (GW) waveforms detectable with LISA, as well as their\npost-merger retention rate in galaxies and thus their subsequent merger rate.\nHere we present a novel study that introduces a sub-resolution model for gas-\nand GW-driven MBH binary spin evolution using a population of accreting MBHs\nfrom the Illustris cosmological hydrodynamics simulations. We also model\nsub-resolution binary inspiral via dynamical friction, stellar scattering,\nviscous gas drag, and GW emission.

The MBH misalignment\nfraction depends strongly on the accretion disc parameters, however. Reducing\naccretion rates by a factor of 100, in a thicker disc, yields 79% and 42%\nmisalignment for primaries and secondaries, respectively.

The experiments are\nconducted on two weakly-supervised neural-symbolic tasks: (1) handwritten\nformula recognition on the newly introduced HWF dataset; (2) visual question\nanswering on the CLEVR dataset. The results show that our approach\nsignificantly outperforms the RL methods in terms of performance, converging\nspeed, and data efficiency.

The relation as traced by galaxy rotation\ncurves is one-to-one with remarkably little scatter, implying that the dynamics\nof a system can be predicted simply by measuring its density profile as traced\nby e.g. stellar light or gas emission lines. Extending the relation to\naccelerations below those usually probed by practically observable kinematic\ntracers is challenging, especially once accounting for faintly emitting\nbaryons, such as the putative warm-hot intergalactic medium, becomes important.\nWe show that in the low-acceleration regime, the (inverted) RAR predicts an\nunphysical, declining enclosed baryonic mass profile for systems with\n`observed' acceleration profiles steeper than $g_{\\rm obs}\\propto r^{-1}$\n(corresponding to density profiles steeper than isothermal - $\\rho(r)\\propto\nr^{-2}$). If the RAR is tantamount to a natural law, such acceleration profiles\ncannot exist. We apply this argument to test the compatibility of an\nextrapolation of the rotation curve-derived RAR to low accelerations with data\nfrom galaxy-galaxy weak lensing, dwarf spheroidal galaxy stellar kinematic, and\nouter Milky~Way dynamical measurements, fully independent of the uncertainties\ninherent in direct measurements of the baryonic matter distribution. In all\ncases we find that the data weakly favour a break to a steeper low-acceleration\nslope.

Our first contribution is to\nshow that -for a broad class of geometric perception problems- TLS estimation\ncan be reformulated as an optimization over the ring of polynomials and\nLasserre's hierarchy of convex moment relaxations is empirically tight at the\nminimum relaxation order (i.e., certifiably obtains the global minimum of the\nnonconvex TLS problem). Our second contribution is to exploit the structural\nsparsity of the objective and constraint polynomials and leverage basis\nreduction to significantly reduce the size of the semidefinite program (SDP)\nresulting from the moment relaxation, without compromising its tightness. Our\nthird contribution is to develop scalable dual optimality certifiers from the\nlens of sums-of-squares (SOS) relaxation, that can compute the suboptimality\ngap and possibly certify global optimality of any candidate solution (e.g.,\nreturned by fast heuristics such as RANSAC or graduated non-convexity).

Second, a simple, yet\neffective, training strategy was introduced to balance the non-occluded and\noccluded facial images. Extensive experiments demonstrated that OREO improved\nthe generalization ability of face recognition under occlusions by (10.17%) in\na single-image-based setting and outperformed the baseline by approximately\n(2%) in terms of rank-1 accuracy in an image-set-based scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 2020 20:17:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-15"}

The field dependence of the critical current density\n($J_\\mathrm{c}$) is analyzed through the strong pinning model, with which the\npristine sample is consistent. After the irradiation, the $J_\\mathrm{c}$\naberrates from the strong pinning field dependence of $B^{-5/8}$, and evolves\nto a weaker $B^{-1/3}$ dependence with an anomalous two-step behavior creating\na cusp like feature. The cusp coincides with the field of the local minima in\nthe normalized relaxation rate ($S$), manifested by increased pinning due to\nincreased intervortex interactions followed by fast vortex dynamics caused by\nflux activation at higher fields. Furthermore, single vortex imaging reveals\nthat while long-range triangular correlation of the Abrikosov vortex lattice is\nobserved in pristine samples, irradiated samples exhibit a highly disordered\nglassy vortex state which is more densely packed with increased pinning force.\nThese artificial defects incorporated via proton irradiation have the same\npinning effect as Co doping which not only shifts the pinning force to a higher\ndegree but also broadens its distribution, in contrast to P doping which only\nbroadens the pinning distribution without inducing a shift.

Augmentation operations\ncommonly used in vision and language have no analogs for graphs. Our work\nstudies graph data augmentation for graph neural networks (GNNs) in the context\nof improving semi-supervised node-classification. We discuss practical and\ntheoretical motivations, considerations and strategies for graph data\naugmentation. Our work shows that neural edge predictors can effectively encode\nclass-homophilic structure to promote intra-class edges and demote inter-class\nedges in given graph structure, and our main contribution introduces the GAug\ngraph data augmentation framework, which leverages these insights to improve\nperformance in GNN-based node classification via edge prediction. Extensive\nexperiments on multiple benchmarks show that augmentation via GAug improves\nperformance across GNN architectures and datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 2020 21:17:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2020 17:58:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-03"}

Unfortunately, in\npractice, the true underlying structural causal model is generally unknown. In\nthis work, we first show that it is impossible to guarantee recourse without\naccess to the true structural equations. To address this limitation, we propose\ntwo probabilistic approaches to select optimal actions that achieve recourse\nwith high probability given limited causal knowledge (e.g., only the causal\ngraph). The first captures uncertainty over structural equations under additive\nGaussian noise, and uses Bayesian model averaging to estimate the\ncounterfactual distribution. The second removes any assumptions on the\nstructural equations by instead computing the average effect of recourse\nactions on individuals similar to the person who seeks recourse, leading to a\nnovel subpopulation-based interventional notion of recourse. We then derive a\ngradient-based procedure for selecting optimal recourse actions, and\nempirically show that the proposed approaches lead to more reliable\nrecommendations under imperfect causal knowledge than non-probabilistic\nbaselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 2020 21:19:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Jun 2020 14:00:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 23 Oct 2020 11:31:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-26"}

While the application of an affine transformation results in\nrigid registration, using a general nonlinear function to achieve nonrigid\nregistration is necessary when the point sets require deformations that change\nover space. The use of a local likelihood-based approach using windowed\nGaussian processes provides a flexible way to accurately estimate the nonrigid\ndeformation. This strategy also makes registration of massive data sets\nfeasible by splitting the data into many subsets. The estimation results yield\nspatially-varying local rigid registration parameters.

This new implementation allows for a grid\nsearch over both the period ($P$) and the time derivative of the period\n($\\dot{P}$). To demonstrate the usage of this tool, we use a small, hand-picked\nsubset of a UCB population generated from the population synthesis code\n\\cosmic, as well as a custom catalog for varying periods at fixed intrinsic\nparameters. We simulate light curves as likely to be observed by future time\ndomain surveys by using an existing eclipsing binary light curve model\naccounting for the change in orbital period due to gravitational radiation. We\nfind that a search with $\\dot{P}$ values is necessary for detecting binaries at\norbital periods less than $\\sim$10 min. We also show it is useful in finding\nand characterizing binaries with longer periods, but at a higher computational\ncost. Our code is called gce (GPU-Accelerated Conditional Entropy).

In this work, we explore the use of\nfeudal networks, used in hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL), to devise a\nvehicle agent to predict steering angles from first person, dash-cam images of\nthe Udacity driving dataset. Our method, Feudal Steering, is inspired by recent\nwork in HRL consisting of a manager network and a worker network that operate\non different temporal scales and have different goals. The manager works at a\ntemporal scale that is relatively coarse compared to the worker and has a\nhigher level, task-oriented goal space. Using feudal learning to divide the\ntask into manager and worker sub-networks provides more accurate and robust\nprediction. Temporal abstraction in driving allows more complex primitives than\nthe steering angle at a single time instance. Composite actions comprise a\nsubroutine or skill that can be re-used throughout the driving sequence. The\nassociated subroutine id is the manager network's goal, so that the manager\nseeks to succeed at the high level task (e.g. a sharp right turn, a slight\nright turn, moving straight in traffic, or moving straight unencumbered by\ntraffic). The steering angle at a particular time instance is the worker\nnetwork output which is regulated by the manager's high level task.

Practical\ngraphs come in huge sizes, offer massive parallelism, and are stored in\nsparse-matrix formats such as CSR. To exploit the massive parallelism,\ndevelopers are increasingly interested in using GPUs for graph traversal.\nHowever, due to their sizes, graphs often do not fit into the GPU memory. Prior\nworks have either used input data pre-processing/partitioning or UVM to migrate\nchunks of data from the host memory to the GPU memory.

Furthermore, the torsion induces an\n$AdS-dS$ transition on the exterior region. Inside the brane core, the torsion\nproduces an internal structure even for a single complex scalar field.

The connection leads to (1)\nprobability ratio clipping that regularizes generator training to prevent\nexcessively large updates, and (2) a sample re-weighting mechanism that\nimproves discriminator training by downplaying bad-quality fake samples.\nMoreover, our variational GAN framework can provably overcome the training\nissue in many GANs that an optimal discriminator cannot provide any informative\ngradient to training generator. By plugging the training approach in diverse\nstate-of-the-art GAN architectures, we obtain significantly improved\nperformance over a range of tasks, including text generation, text style\ntransfer, and image generation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2020 01:39:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2020 15:02:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 23 Oct 2020 03:24:01 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2020 16:27:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-02"}

A key mechanism that enables the\nformation of complex architecture in the developing brain is the emergence of\ntraveling spatio-temporal waves of neuronal activity across the growing brain.\nInspired by this strategy, we attempt to efficiently self-organize large neural\nnetworks with an arbitrary number of layers into a wide variety of\narchitectures. To achieve this, we propose a modular tool-kit in the form of a\ndynamical system that can be seamlessly stacked to assemble multi-layer neural\nnetworks. The dynamical system encapsulates the dynamics of spiking units,\ntheir inter/intra layer interactions as well as the plasticity rules that\ncontrol the flow of information between layers. The key features of our\ntool-kit are (1) autonomous spatio-temporal waves across multiple layers\ntriggered by activity in the preceding layer and (2) Spike-timing dependent\nplasticity (STDP) learning rules that update the inter-layer connectivity based\non wave activity in the connecting layers. Our framework leads to the\nself-organization of a wide variety of architectures, ranging from multi-layer\nperceptrons to autoencoders. We also demonstrate that emergent waves can\nself-organize spiking network architecture to perform unsupervised learning,\nand networks can be coupled with a linear classifier to perform classification\non classic image datasets like MNIST. Broadly, our work shows that a dynamical\nsystems framework for learning can be used to self-organize large computational\ndevices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2020 01:44:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-15"}

Percutaneous coronary intervention(PCI) in stable coronary artery\ndisease(CAD) is commonly triggered by abnormal myocardial perfusion\nimaging(MPI).

This study aims to develop a 3D multi-modality\nfusion approach to assist decision-making for PCI. Methods. Coronary arteries\nfrom fluoroscopic angiography(FA) were reconstructed into 3D artery anatomy.\nLeft ventricular(LV) epicardial surface was extracted from SPECT. The 3D artery\nanatomy was non-rigidly fused with the LV epicardial surface. The accuracy of\nthe 3D fusion was evaluated via both computer simulation and real patient data.\nFor technical validation, simulated FA and MPI were integrated and then\ncompared with the ground truth from a digital phantom. For clinical validation,\nFA and SPECT images were integrated and then compared with the ground truth\nfrom CT angiograms. Results. In the technical evaluation, the distance-based\nmismatch error between simulated fluoroscopy and phantom arteries is\n1.86(SD:1.43)mm for left coronary arteries(LCA) and 2.21(SD:2.50)mm for right\ncoronary arteries(RCA). In the clinical validation, the distance-based mismatch\nerrors between the fluoroscopy and CT arteries were 3.84(SD:3.15)mm for LCA and\n5.55(SD:3.64)mm for RCA.

The problem definition in this paper is\ninspired by three major requirements of the next generations of wireless\nnetworks. Firstly, the proposed scheme is particularly beneficial in\nlow-capacity regimes which is important in practical scenarios of utmost\ninterest such as the Internet-of-Things (IoT) and massive machine-type\ncommunication (mMTC). Secondly, we employ code-domain NOMA to efficiently share\nthe scarce common resources among the users. Finally, the proposed recursive\napproach enables code-domain NOMA with low-complexity detection algorithms that\nare scalable with the number of users to satisfy the requirements of massive\nconnectivity. To this end, we propose a novel encoding and decoding scheme for\ncode-domain NOMA based on factorizing the pattern matrix, for assigning the\navailable resource elements to the users, as the Kronecker product of several\nsmaller factor matrices. As a result, both the pattern matrix design at the\ntransmitter side and the mixed symbols' detection at the receiver side can be\nperformed over matrices with dimensions that are much smaller than the overall\npattern matrix. Consequently, this leads to significant reduction in both the\ncomplexity and the latency of the detection. We present the detection algorithm\nfor the general case of factor matrices. The proposed algorithm involves\nseveral recursions each involving certain sets of equations corresponding to a\ncertain factor matrix. We then characterize the system performance in terms of\naverage sum rate, latency, and detection complexity. Our latency and complexity\nanalysis confirm the superiority of our proposed scheme in enabling large\npattern matrices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2020 02:50:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Mar 2021 03:20:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-12"}

Most of existing SR models only focus\non exploiting the consecutive items in a session interacted by a certain user,\nto capture the transition pattern among the items. Although some of them have\nbeen proven effective, the following two insights are often neglected. First, a\nuser's micro-behaviors, such as the manner in which the user locates an item,\nthe activities that the user commits on an item (e.g., reading comments, adding\nto cart), offer fine-grained and deep understanding of the user's preference.\nSecond, the item attributes, also known as item knowledge, provide side\ninformation to model the transition pattern among interacted items and\nalleviate the data sparsity problem. These insights motivate us to propose a\nnovel SR model MKM-SR in this paper, which incorporates user Micro-behaviors\nand item Knowledge into Multi-task learning for Session-based Recommendation.\nSpecifically, a given session is modeled on micro-behavior level in MKM-SR,\ni.e., with a sequence of item-operation pairs rather than a sequence of items,\nto capture the transition pattern in the session sufficiently. Furthermore, we\npropose a multi-task learning paradigm to involve learning knowledge embeddings\nwhich plays a role as an auxiliary task to promote the major task of SR.

Firstly, we extend the actor-critic architecture to actor-critic-N\narchitecture by introducing more critics beyond rewards. Secondly, we combine\nthe reward-based critic with a potential-field-based critic to formulate the\nproposed potential field guided actor-critic reinforcement learning approach\n(actor-critic-2). This can be seen as a combination of the model-based\ngradients and the model-free gradients in policy improvement. State with large\npotential field often contains a strong prior information, such as pointing to\nthe target at a long distance or avoiding collision by the side of an obstacle.\nIn this situation, we should trust potential-field-based critic more as policy\nevaluation to accelerate policy improvement, where action policy tends to be\nguided. For example, in practical application, learning to avoid obstacles\nshould be guided rather than learned by trial and error. State with small\npotential filed is often lack of information, for example, at the local minimum\npoint or around the moving target. At this time, we should trust reward-based\ncritic as policy evaluation more to evaluate the long-term return. In this\ncase, action policy tends to explore. In addition, potential field evaluation\ncan be combined with planning to estimate a better state value function. In\nthis way, reward design can focus more on the final stage of reward, rather\nthan reward shaping or phased reward. Furthermore, potential field evaluation\ncan make up for the lack of communication in multi-agent cooperation problem,\ni.e., multi-agent each has a reward-based critic and a relative unified\npotential-field-based critic with prior information.

In the real\nscenario, individuals have a different level of awareness for self-protection\nwhen facing the outbreak of an epidemic. To investigate the effects of the\nheterogeneous self-awareness distribution on the epidemic dynamics, we propose\na resource-epidemic coevolution model in this paper. We first study the effects\nof the heterogeneous distributions of node degree and self-awareness on the\nepidemic dynamics on artificial networks. Through extensive simulations, we\nfind that the heterogeneity of self-awareness distribution suppresses the\noutbreak of an epidemic, and the heterogeneity of degree distribution enhances\nthe epidemic spreading. Next, we study how the correlation between node degree\nand self-awareness affects the epidemic dynamics. The results reveal that when\nthe correlation is positive, the heterogeneity of self-awareness restrains the\nepidemic spreading. While, when there is a significant negative correlation,\nstrong heterogeneous or strong homogeneous distribution of the self-awareness\nis not conducive for disease suppression. We find an optimal heterogeneity of\nself-awareness, at which the disease can be suppressed to the most extent.\nFurther research shows that the epidemic threshold increases monotonously when\nthe correlation changes from most negative to most positive, and a critical\nvalue of the correlation coefficient is found. When the coefficient is below\nthe critical value, an optimal heterogeneity of self-awareness exists;\notherwise, the epidemic threshold decreases monotonously with the decline of\nthe self-awareness heterogeneity. At last, we verify the results on four\ntypical real-world networks and find that the results on the real-world\nnetworks are consistent with those on the artificial network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2020 04:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-15"}

To meet such demands, we designed and implemented\na special tool named AstroCatR that can efficiently and flexibly reconstruct\ntime series data from large-scale astronomical catalogues. AstroCatR can load\noriginal catalogue data from Flexible Image Transport System (FITS) files or\ndatabases, match each item to determine which object it belongs to, and finally\nproduce time series datasets.

We evaluated AstroCatR with actual observation\ndata from The three Antarctic Survey Telescopes (AST3).

From the perspective of the\nwell established plasticity-stability dilemma, neural networks tend to be\noverly plastic, lacking the stability necessary to prevent the forgetting of\nprevious knowledge, which means that as learning progresses, networks tend to\nforget previously seen tasks. This phenomenon coined in the continual learning\nliterature, has attracted much attention lately, and several families of\napproaches have been proposed with different degrees of success. However, there\nhas been limited prior work extensively analyzing the impact that different\ntraining regimes -- learning rate, batch size, regularization method-- can have\non forgetting. In this work, we depart from the typical approach of altering\nthe learning algorithm to improve stability. Instead, we hypothesize that the\ngeometrical properties of the local minima found for each task play an\nimportant role in the overall degree of forgetting. In particular, we study the\neffect of dropout, learning rate decay, and batch size, on forming training\nregimes that widen the tasks' local minima and consequently, on helping it not\nto forget catastrophically.

Methods: We model the escaping planetary atmosphere, the stellar\nwind, and their interaction employing a multi-fluid, three-dimensional\nhydrodynamic code. We assume a planetary atmosphere composed of hydrogen and\nhelium. We run models varying the stellar high-energy emission and stellar\nmass-loss rate, further computing for each case the Ly$\\alpha$ synthetic\nplanetary atmospheric absorption and comparing it with the observations.\nResults: We find that a non-detection of Ly$\\alpha$ in absorption employing the\nstellar high-energy emission estimated from far-ultraviolet and X-ray data\nrequires a stellar wind with a stellar mass-loss rate about six times lower\nthan solar. This result is a consequence of the fact that, for $\\pi$ Men c,\ndetectable Ly$\\alpha$ absorption can be caused exclusively by energetic neutral\natoms, which become more abundant with increasing the velocity and/or the\ndensity of the stellar wind. By considering, instead, that the star has a\nsolar-like wind, the non-detection requires a stellar ionising radiation about\nfour times higher than estimated. This is because, despite the fact that a\nstronger stellar high-energy emission ionises hydrogen more rapidly, it also\nincreases the upper atmosphere heating and expansion, pushing the interaction\nregion with the stellar wind farther away from the planet, where the planet\natmospheric density that remains neutral becomes smaller and the production of\nenergetic neutral atoms less efficient. Conclusions: Comparing the results of\nour grid of models with what is expected and estimated for the stellar wind and\nhigh-energy emission, respectively, we support the idea that the atmosphere of\n$\\pi$ Men c is likely not hydrogen-dominated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2020 06:01:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-22"}

Then, background\nframes can be detected by estimating the probability of each frame being\nout-of-distribution, known as uncertainty, but it is infeasible to directly\nlearn uncertainty without frame-level labels. To realize the uncertainty\nlearning in the weakly-supervised setting, we leverage the multiple instance\nlearning formulation.

Currently, the prevailing techniques such as wavefront\nshaping, optical phase conjugation, scattering matrix measurement, and speckle\nautocorrelation imaging can only picture the target structure in the absence of\nprior information.

The second, more general explanation\nrelates to an induced shuffling within a sequence, or equivalently a limited\nconcentration of identical symbols, that is an inherent property for short CC\nblocks, yet not necessarily present for long blocks. This temporal property\nresults in weaker nonlinear interactions, and thus higher SNR, for short CC\nsequences. For a typical multi-span fiber setup, the SNR difference is\nnumerically demonstrated to be up to 0.7dB. Finally, we evaluate a heuristic\nfigure of merit that captures the number of runs of identical symbols in a\nconcatenation of several CC sequences. For moderate block lengths up to\napproximately 100 symbols, this metric suggests that limiting the number of\nidentical-symbol runs can be beneficial.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2020 09:50:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-15"}

Huffman-coded sphere shaping\n(HCSS) is discussed in detail, which internally uses Huffman coding to\ndetermine the composition to be used and relies on conventional CCDM algorithms\nfor mapping and demapping. Numerical simulations show that HCSS closes the\nperformance gap between distribution matching schemes and sphere shaping\ntechniques such as enumerative sphere shaping (ESS). HCSS is based on an\narchitecture that is different from the trellis-based setup of ESS. It allows\nto tailor the used HCSS compositions to the transmission channel and to take\ninto account complexity constraints. We further discuss in detail multiset\nranking (MR) and subset ranking (SR) as alternatives to arithmetic-coding (AC)\nCCDM. The advantage of MR over AC is that it requires less sequential\noperations for mapping. SR operates on binary alphabets only, which can\nintroduce some additional rate loss when a nonbinary-to-binary transformation\nis required. However, the binomial coefficients required for SR can be\nprecomputed and stored in a lookup table (LUT).

Indeed, solving optimal transport (OT) with an\nentropic regularization requires computing a $n\\times n$ kernel matrix (the\nneg-exponential of a $n\\times n$ pairwise ground cost matrix) that is\nrepeatedly applied to a vector. We propose to use instead ground costs of the\nform $c(x,y)=-\\log\\dotp{\\varphi(x)}{\\varphi(y)}$ where $\\varphi$ is a map from\nthe ground space onto the positive orthant $\\RR^r_+$, with $r\\ll n$.

The recently\nproposed activity-centric search over knowledge graph supports direct search of\nprogramming actions, but it has limitations in action coverage, natural\nlanguage based task search, and coarse-grained code example recommendation.

Traditionally, mutual exclusion algorithms\nhave been designed under the assumption that a process does not fail while\nacquiring/releasing a lock or while executing its critical section. However,\nfailures do occur in real life, potentially leaving the lock in an inconsistent\nstate. This gives rise to the problem of \\emph{recoverable mutual exclusion\n(RME)} that involves designing a mutual exclusion algorithm that can tolerate\nfailures, while maintaining safety and liveness properties.\n  One of the important measures of performance of any ME algorithm, including\nan RME algorithm, is the number of \\emph{remote memory references (RMRs)} made\nby a process (for acquiring and releasing a lock as well as recovering the lock\nstructure after a failure).

Our geometry allows to eliminate\nany direct injection of quasiparticles through the substrate thereby making\ncold electron field emission through the vacuum the only possible charge\ntransport mechanism. With the aid of a fully numerical 3D model in combination\nwith the observed phenomenology and thermal considerations we can rule out,\nwith any realistic likelihood, the occurrence of cold electron field emission.\nExcluding these two trivial phenomena is pivotal in light of understanding the\nmicroscopic nature of gating effect in superconducting nanostructures, which\nrepresents an unsolved puzzle in contemporary superconductivity. Yet, from the\ntechnological point of view, our suspended fabrication technique provides the\nenabling technology to implement a variety of applications and fundamental\nstudies combining, for instance, superconductivity with nano-mechanics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2020 11:32:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 23 Jan 2021 12:49:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-26"}

However, these\nworks do not take label dependencies into consideration and lack a theoretical\nanalysis of loss functions. Accordingly, we propose a novel online metric\nlearning paradigm for multi-label classification to fill the current research\ngap. Generally, we first propose a new metric for multi-label classification\nwhich is based on $k$-Nearest Neighbour ($k$NN) and combined with large margin\nprinciple. Then, we adapt it to the online settting to derive our model which\ndeals with massive volume ofstreaming data at a higher speed online.\nSpecifically, in order to learn the new $k$NN-based metric, we first project\ninstances in the training dataset into the label space, which make it possible\nfor the comparisons of instances and labels in the same dimension. After that,\nwe project both of them into a new lower dimension space simultaneously, which\nenables us to extract the structure of dependencies between instances and\nlabels. Finally, we leverage the large margin and $k$NN principle to learn the\nmetric with an efficient optimization algorithm. Moreover, we provide\ntheoretical analysis on the upper bound of the cumulative loss for our method.\nComprehensive experiments on a number of benchmark multi-label datasets\nvalidate our theoretical approach and illustrate that our proposed online\nmetric learning (OML) algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2020 11:33:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-15"}

This paper proposes a new Reinforced Data\nSampling (RDS) method to learn how to sample data adequately on the search for\nuseful models and insights. We formulate the optimisation problem of model\ndiversification $\\delta{-div}$ in data sampling to maximise learning potentials\nand optimum allocation by injecting model diversity.

We introduce different ensemble reward\nmechanisms, including soft voting and stochastic choice to approximate optimal\nsampling policy. The evaluation conducted on four datasets evidently highlights\nthe benefits of using RDS method over traditional sampling approaches.

Motivated by such observations, we propose a\nvariance-controlling technique termed Node Normalization (NodeNorm), which\nscales each node's features using its own standard deviation. Experimental\nresults validate the effectiveness of NodeNorm on addressing performance\ndegradation of GCNs. Specifically, it enables deep GCNs to outperform shallow\nones in cases where deep models are needed, and to achieve comparable results\nwith shallow ones on 6 benchmark datasets. NodeNorm is a generic plug-in and\ncan well generalize to other GNN architectures.

Unlike\nprevious works that exploit architecture-specific cues such as activation and\nattention for distillation, here we wish to explore a more general and\nmodel-agnostic approach for extracting \"richer dark knowledge\" from the\npre-trained teacher model. We show that the seemingly different\nself-supervision task can serve as a simple yet powerful solution. For example,\nwhen performing contrastive learning between transformed entities, the noisy\npredictions of the teacher network reflect its intrinsic composition of\nsemantic and pose information. By exploiting the similarity between those\nself-supervision signals as an auxiliary task, one can effectively transfer the\nhidden information from the teacher to the student.

Deep learning has become in recent\nyears a popular way to extract knowledge from the huge amount of data that\nthese devices are able to collect. Nevertheless, centralized state-of-the-art\nlearning methods have a number of drawbacks when facing real distributed\nproblems, in which the available information is usually private, partial,\nbiased and evolving over time. Federated learning is a popular framework that\nallows multiple distributed devices to train models remotely, collaboratively,\nand preserving data privacy. However, the current proposals in federated\nlearning focus on deep architectures that in many cases are not feasible to\nimplement in non-dedicated devices such as smartphones. Also, little research\nhas been done regarding the scenario where data distribution changes over time\nin unforeseen ways, causing what is known as concept drift. Therefore, in this\nwork we want to present Light Federated and Continual Consensus (LFedCon2), a\nnew federated and continual architecture that uses light, traditional learners.\nOur method allows powerless devices (such as smartphones or robots) to learn in\nreal time, locally, continuously, autonomously and from users, but also\nimproving models globally, in the cloud, combining what is learned locally, in\nthe devices. In order to test our proposal, we have applied it in a\nheterogeneous community of smartphone users to solve the problem of walking\nrecognition. The results show the advantages that LFedCon2 provides with\nrespect to other state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2020 12:37:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2021 18:03:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-13"}

Spatially modulated lattice deformation can create a bandgap\ngradient, favouring photo-generated charge separation and collection in\noptoelectronic devices. These advantages are hindered by the maximum elastic\nstrain that a material can withstand before breaking. Nanomaterials derived by\nexfoliating transition metal dichalcogenides TMDs are an ideal playground for\nelastic deformation, as they can sustain large elastic strains, up to a few\npercent.

In ZrS2, the irreversible\ntransformation between two different layered structures is accompanied by a\nsudden 14 % bandgap reduction.

There is growing\nconsensus that collimated jets create cavities with dense walls in the\nslowly-expanding (10--20 ~km~s$^{-1}$) envelope ejected in previous\nevolutionary phases, leading to the observed morphologies. However, the\nlaunching of the jet and the way it interacts with the circumstellar material\nto create such asymmetric morphologies have remained poorly known. Here we\npresent for the first time CO emission from the asymptotic giant branch star\nW43A that traces the whole stream of a jet, from the vicinity of its driving\nstellar system out to the regions where it shapes the circumstellar envelope.\nWe found that the jet has a launch velocity of 175~km~s$^{-1}$ and decelerates\nto a velocity of 130~km~s$^{-1}$ as it interacts with circumstellar material.\nThe continuum emission reveals a bipolar shell with a compact bright dot in the\ncentre that pinpoints the location of the driving source of the jet. The\nkinematical ages of the jet and the bipolar shell are equal,\n$\\tau$$\\sim$60~years, indicating that they were created simultaneously,\nprobably by a common underlying mechanism, and in an extremely short time.\nThese results provide key initial conditions for the theoretical models that\naim to explain the formation of bipolar morphologies in the circumstellar\nenvelopes of low and intermediate mass stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2020 13:15:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-15"}

The methods which are used so far\nfor matter reconstructions are the Richardson-Lucy algorithm, an iterative\nGauss-Newton method and a statistical approach assuming a one-to-one\ncorrespondence between matter and flux.

Precise prediction of\ntemperatures allows to operate the system at the physical limit of the device\navoiding undesirable over-temperatures and thus improve reliability of the\nmodule. Commonly used thermal models can be based on detailed expert knowledge\nof the device's physical structure or on precise and complete temperature\ndistribution measurements. The latter approach is more often used in the\nindustry. Recently, we have proposed a linear time invariant state-space\nthermal model based on a compartment representation and its identification\nprocedure that is based on the Expectation-Maximization algorithm from\nincomplete temperature data. However, the model still requires to measure\ntemperatures of all active elements. In this contribution, we aim to relax the\nneed for all measurements. Therefore, we replace the previous dark gray-box\napproach with a structured compartment model. The structure of the model is\ndesigned by a mesh-based discretization of the physical layout of the module.\nAll compartments are assumed to share parameters that are identified from the\ndata of the measured elements. Temperatures of the unmeasured elements are\npredicted using the shared parameters. Identification of the parameters is\npossible only with suitable regularization due to limited amount of the data.\nIn particular, the model tightening is accomplished by sharing parameters among\ncompartments and by constraining the process covariance matrix of the model in\nthis contribution. Applicability of the proposed identification procedure is\ndiscussed in terms of growing state-space and therefore speeding up of the\nidentification algorithm is suggested. Performance of the proposed approach is\ntested and demonstrated on simulated data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2020 13:23:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-15"}

To identify dominant features, we propose a sequential application\nof multiresolution decomposition and variogram function estimation.\nMultiresolution decomposition separates data into additive components, and in\nthis way enables the recognition of their dominant features. A dedicated\nmultiresolution decomposition method is developed for arbitrary gridded spatial\ndata, where the underlying model includes a precision and spatial-weight matrix\nto capture spatial correlation. The data are separated into their components by\nsmoothing on different scales, such that larger scales have longer spatial\ncorrelation ranges. Moreover, our model can handle missing values, which is\noften useful in applications. Variogram function estimation can be used to\ndescribe properties in spatial data. Such functions are therefore estimated for\neach component to determine its effective range, which assesses the\nwidth-extent of the dominant feature. Finally, Bayesian analysis enables the\ninference of identified dominant features and to judge whether these are\ncredibly different. The efficient implementation of the method relies mainly on\na sparse-matrix data structure and algorithms.

Our hypothesis is that the use\nof tasksimilarity helps meta-learning when the available tasks are limited and\nmay contain outlier/ dissimilar tasks. While existing meta-learning approaches\nimplicitly assume the tasks as being similar, it is generally unclear how this\ntask-similarity could be quantified and used in the learning. As a result, most\npopular metalearning approaches do not actively use the\nsimilarity/dissimilarity between the tasks, but rely on availability of huge\nnumber of tasks for their working. Our contribution is a novel framework for\nmeta-learning that explicitly uses task-similarity in the form of kernels and\nan associated meta-learning algorithm. We model the task-specific parameters to\nbelong to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space where the kernel function captures\nthe similarity across tasks. The proposed algorithm iteratively learns a\nmeta-parameter which is used to assign a task-specific descriptor for every\ntask.

They are generated\nby outflows of plasma ejected at near the speed of light by newly formed\nneutron stars or black holes of stellar mass at cosmological distances. Prompt\nflashes of MeV gamma rays are followed by longer-lasting afterglow emission\nfrom radio waves to GeV gamma rays, due to synchrotron radiation by energetic\nelectrons in accompanying shock waves. Although emission of gamma rays at even\nhigher, TeV energies by other radiation mechanisms had been theoretically\npredicted, it had never been detected previously. Here we report the clear\ndetection of GRB 190114C in the TeV band, achieved after many years of\ndedicated searches for TeV emission from GRBs. Gamma rays in the energy range\n0.2--1 TeV are observed from about 1 minute after the burst (at more than 50\nstandard deviations in the first 20 minutes). This unambiguously reveals a new\nemission component in the afterglow of a GRB, whose power is comparable to that\nof the synchrotron component. The observed similarity in the radiated power and\ntemporal behaviour of the TeV and X-ray bands points to processes such as\ninverse Compton radiation as the mechanism of the TeV emission, while processes\nsuch as synchrotron emission by ultrahigh-energy protons are disfavoured due to\ntheir low radiative efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2020 15:05:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-15"}

They are\ncharacterised by an initial phase of bright and highly variable radiation in\nthe keV-MeV band that is likely produced within the jet and lasts from\nmilliseconds to minutes, known as the prompt emission. Subsequently, the\ninteraction of the jet with the external medium generates external shock waves,\nresponsible for the afterglow emission, which lasts from days to months, and\noccurs over a broad energy range, from the radio to the GeV bands. The\nafterglow emission is generally well explained as synchrotron radiation by\nelectrons accelerated at the external shock. Recently, an intense, long-lasting\nemission between 0.2 and 1 TeV was observed from the GRB 190114C. Here we\npresent the results of our multi-frequency observational campaign of\nGRB~190114C, and study the evolution in time of the GRB emission across 17\norders of magnitude in energy, from $5\\times10^{-6}$ up to $10^{12}$\\,eV. We\nfind that the broadband spectral energy distribution is double-peaked, with the\nTeV emission constituting a distinct spectral component that has power\ncomparable to the synchrotron component. This component is associated with the\nafterglow, and is satisfactorily explained by inverse Compton upscattering of\nsynchrotron photons by high-energy electrons. We find that the conditions\nrequired to account for the observed TeV component are not atypical, supporting\nthe possibility that inverse Compton emission is commonly produced in GRBs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2020 15:05:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-15"}

In\nthe framework of quantum stochastic thermodynamics, this is constructed as the\naverage over the fluctuating quantum heat (FQH), defined as the increase in\nexpected value of the Hamiltonian along two-point eigenstate trajectories.\nHowever, such a definition has two drawbacks: (i) if the initial state does not\ncommute with the Hamiltonian and has degeneracies, the higher moments of the\nFQH will not be uniquely defined, and therefore it is arguable whether such a\nquantity is physically meaningful; (ii) the definition is operationally\ndemanding as it requires full knowledge of the initial state.

Nevertheless, needing prior\ninformation on the number and directions of sources or demanding heavy\ncomputational load makes most of these techniques less useful in practice. In\nthis paper, a low complexity subspace-based framework for DOA estimation of\nbroadband signals, named as wideband modal orthogonality (WIMO), is proposed\nand accordingly two DOA estimators are developed. First, a closed-form\napproximation of spatial-temporal covariance matrix (STCM) in the uniform\nspectrum case is presented. The eigenvectors of STCM associated with non-zero\neigenvalues are modal components of the wideband source in a given bandwidth\nand direction. WIMO idea is to extract these eigenvectors at desired DOAs from\nthe approximated STCM and test their orthogonality to estimated noise subspace.\nIn the non-uniform spectrum case, WIMO idea can be applied by approximating\nSTCM through numerical integration. Fortunately, STCM approximation and modal\nextraction can be performed offline. WIMO provides DOA estimation without the\nconventional prerequisites, such as spectral decomposition, focusing procedure\nand, a priori information on the number of sources and their DOAs. Several\nnumerical examples are conducted to compare the WIMO performance with the\nstate-of-the-art methods. Simulations demonstrate that the two proposed DOA\nestimators achieve superior performance in terms of probability of resolution\nand estimation error along with orders of magnitude runtime speedup.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2020 15:17:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-15"}

We employ numerical path continuation and direct time\nsimulations to first investigate the existence regions of different types of\nlocalized states for a one-dimensional system. The results are summarized in\nmorphological phase diagrams in the parameter plane spanned by activity and\nmean concentration. Then we focus on the interaction of traveling localized\nstates studying their collision behavior. As a result we distinguish 'elastic'\nand 'inelastic' collisions. In the former, localized states recover their\nproperties after a collision while in the latter they may annihilate or form\nresting or traveling bound states.

A\ncouple dozen new candidate BDs located inside the tidal radius of Coma Ber are\nreported, but none of these are significantly fainter and cooler than\npreviously known members. A search for Li in three new and five previously\nknown BD candidate cluster members was performed via spectroscopic observations\nusing the OSIRIS instrument at the 10.4-m GTC. No LiI resonance doublet at\n6707.8 A was detected in any of eight Coma Ber targets in the magnitude range\nJ=15--19 and G=20--23 observed with the GTC. Spectral types and radial\nvelocities were derived from the GTC spectra. These values confirm the cluster\nmembership of four L2--L2.5 dwarfs, two of which are new in the literature. The\nlarge Li depletion factors found among the four bona fide BD members in Coma\nBer implies that the LDB must be located at spectral type later than L2.5 in\nthis cluster. Using the latest evolutionary models for BDs, a lower limit of\n550 Myr on the cluster age is set. This constraint has been combined with other\ndating methods to obtain an updated age estimate of 780$\\pm$230 Myr for the\nComa Ber open cluster. Identification of significantly cooler sub-stellar\ncluster members in Coma Ber awaits the advent of the Euclid wide survey, which\nshould reach a depth of about J=23; this superb sensitivity will make it\npossible to determine the precise location of the sub-stellar LDB in this\ncluster and to carry out a complete census of its sub-stellar population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2020 15:56:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-05"}

For example, video applications like transcoding and compression have\ntill now ignored the fact how speech is delivered and heard.

We\nprovide an empirical examination of how these interest rate rules have behaved\nsince their inception in response to differing degrees of liquidity. We then\ninvestigate the market efficiency and inter-connectedness between multiple\nprotocols, examining first whether Uncovered Interest Parity holds within a\nparticular protocol and second whether the interest rates for a particular\ntoken market show dependence across protocols, developing a Vector Error\nCorrection Model for the dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 2020 17:52:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2020 10:29:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 15 Oct 2020 15:49:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-16"}

Cyber insurance products have been used as risk\nmanagement tools, yet their pricing does not reflect actual risk, including\nthat of multiple, catastrophic and contagious losses. For the modelling of\naggregate losses from cyber events, in this paper we introduce a bivariate\ncompound dynamic contagion process, where the bivariate dynamic contagion\nprocess is a point process that includes both externally excited joint jumps,\nwhich are distributed according to a shot noise Cox process and two separate\nself-excited jumps, which are distributed according to the branching structure\nof a Hawkes process with an exponential fertility rate, respectively. We\nanalyse the theoretical distributional properties for these processes\nsystematically, based on the piecewise deterministic Markov process developed\nby Davis (1984) and the univariate dynamic contagion process theory developed\nby Dassios and Zhao (2011). The analytic expression of the Laplace transform of\nthe compound process and its moments are presented, which have the potential to\nbe applicable to a variety of problems in credit, insurance, market and other\noperational risks. As an application of this process, we provide insurance\npremium calculations based on its moments. Numerical examples show that this\ncompound process can be used for the modelling of aggregate losses from cyber\nevents. We also provide the simulation algorithm for statistical analysis,\nfurther business applications and research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2020 04:40:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-10"}

According to gauge theories, interaction mediating spin-0 bosons must\nbe massless. The theory of HySy predicted massive intermediate bosons.\nHypersymmetry field rotation, described in this paper, justifies the mass of\nthe HySy mediating boson. The mass of intermediate bosons must arise from\ndynamical spontaneous breaking of the group of HySy. HySy rotation is performed\nin the velocity-dependent D field. The derived rotation of the field is defined\nby the spontaneous symmetry breaking and precession of the velocity v around\nits third projection in the D field (that produced the mass of the field s\nbosons). The latter represents the real and effective velocities of a\nboson-emitting particle in the direction towards a target particle. The mass of\nthe discussed (fictitious) Goldstone bosons can be removed by the unitarity\ngauge condition through Higgs (BEH) mechanism. According to the simultaneous\npresence of a Standard Model (SM) interaction s symmetry group and the (beyond\nSM) HySy group, their bosons should be transformed together. Spontaneous\nbreakdown of HySy may allow performing a transformation that does not influence\nthe SM physical state of the investigated system. The paper describes a field\ntransformation that eliminates the mass of the intermediate bosons, rotates the\nSM- and HySy bosons masses together while leaving the SM bosons intact. The\nresult is an angle that characterises the HySy by a precession mechanism of the\nvelocity that generates the field. In contrast to the known SM intermediate\nbosons, the HySy intermediate bosons have no fixed mass. The mass of the HySy\nintermediate bosons (that appear as quanta of a velocity-dependent gauge field\nD) depends on the relative velocity of the particles whose interaction they\nmediate. So, the derived precession angle is a function of that velocity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 2020 17:55:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-13"}
