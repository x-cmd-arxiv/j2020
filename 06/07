Federated learning has emerged recently as a technique for\ntraining ML models at the network edge by leveraging processing capabilities\nacross the nodes that collect the data. There are several challenges with\nemploying conventional federated learning in contemporary networks, due to the\nsignificant heterogeneity in compute and communication capabilities that exist\nacross devices. To address this, we advocate a new learning paradigm called fog\nlearning which will intelligently distribute ML model training across the\ncontinuum of nodes from edge devices to cloud servers. Fog learning enhances\nfederated learning along three major dimensions: network, heterogeneity, and\nproximity. It considers a multi-layer hybrid learning framework consisting of\nheterogeneous devices with various proximities. It accounts for the topology\nstructures of the local networks among the heterogeneous nodes at each network\nlayer, orchestrating them for collaborative/cooperative learning through\ndevice-to-device (D2D) communications. This migrates from star network\ntopologies used for parameter transfers in federated learning to more\ndistributed topologies at scale. We discuss several open research directions to\nrealizing fog learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Jun 2020 05:11:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Sep 2020 21:16:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 23 Oct 2020 14:42:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-26"}

In this\npaper, we elaborate on a tractable analysis framework to evaluate the\nreliability and security of wireless-powered decode-and-forward (DF)\nmulti-relay networks. The nonlinear energy harvesters, in-phase and\nquadrature-phase imbalance (IQI) and channel estimation errors (CEEs) are taken\ninto account in the considered system. To further improve the secure\nperformance, two relay selection strategies are presented: 1) suboptimal relay\nselection (SRS); 2) optimal relay selection (ORS). Specifically, exact\nanalytical expressions for the outage probability (OP) and the intercept\nprobability (IP) are derived in closed-form. For the IP, we consider that the\neavesdropper can wiretap the signal from the source or the relay. In order to\nobtain more useful insights, we carry out the asymptotic analysis and diversity\norders for the OP in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime under\nnon-ideal and ideal conditions. Numerical results show that: 1) Although the\nmismatches of amplitude/phase of transmitter (TX)/receiver (RX) limit the OP\nperformance, it can enhance IP performance; 2) Large number of relays yields\nbetter OP performance; 3) There are error floors for the OP because of the\nCEEs; 4) There is a trade-off for the OP and IO to obtain the balance between\nreliability and security.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Jun 2020 16:00:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-09"}

Many existing approaches\nperform well for license plates collected under constrained conditions, eg,\nshooting in frontal and horizontal view-angles and under good lighting\nconditions. However, their performance drops significantly in an unconstrained\nenvironment that features rotation, distortion, occlusion, blurring, shading or\nextreme dark or bright conditions. In this work, we propose a robust framework\nfor license plate recognition in the wild. It is composed of a tailored\nCycleGAN model for license plate image generation and an elaborate designed\nimage-to-sequence network for plate recognition. On one hand, the CycleGAN\nbased plate generation engine alleviates the exhausting human annotation work.\nMassive amount of training data can be obtained with a more balanced character\ndistribution and various shooting conditions, which helps to boost the\nrecognition accuracy to a large extent. On the other hand, the 2D attentional\nbased license plate recognizer with an Xception-based CNN encoder is capable of\nrecognizing license plates with different patterns under various scenarios\naccurately and robustly. Without using any heuristics rule or post-processing,\nour method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on four public datasets,\nwhich demonstrates the generality and robustness of our framework.

The\nadaptation and learning of other agents induces non-stationarity in the\nenvironment dynamics. This poses a great challenge for value function-based\nalgorithms whose convergence usually relies on the assumption of a stationary\nenvironment. Policy search algorithms also struggle in multi-agent settings as\nthe partial observability resulting from an opponent's actions not being known\nintroduces high variance to policy training. Modelling an agent's opponent(s)\nis often pursued as a means of resolving the issues arising from the\ncoexistence of learning opponents. An opponent model provides an agent with\nsome ability to reason about other agents to aid its own decision making. Most\nprior works learn an opponent model by assuming the opponent is employing a\nstationary policy or switching between a set of stationary policies. Such an\napproach can reduce the variance of training signals for policy search\nalgorithms. However, in the multi-agent setting, agents have an incentive to\ncontinually adapt and learn. This means that the assumptions concerning\nopponent stationarity are unrealistic. In this work, we develop a novel\napproach to modelling an opponent's learning dynamics which we term Learning to\nModel Opponent Learning (LeMOL). We show our structured opponent model is more\naccurate and stable than naive behaviour cloning baselines. We further show\nthat opponent modelling can improve the performance of algorithmic agents in\nmulti-agent settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Jun 2020 17:19:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-09"}

This\npaper argues that acquisition of speech can be modeled as a dependency between\nrandom space and generated speech data in the Generative Adversarial Network\narchitecture and proposes a methodology to uncover the network's internal\nrepresentations that correspond to phonetic and phonological properties. The\nGenerative Adversarial architecture is uniquely appropriate for modeling\nphonetic and phonological learning because the network is trained on\nunannotated raw acoustic data and learning is unsupervised without any\nlanguage-specific assumptions or pre-assumed levels of abstraction. A\nGenerative Adversarial Network was trained on an allophonic distribution in\nEnglish. The network successfully learns the allophonic alternation: the\nnetwork's generated speech signal contains the conditional distribution of\naspiration duration. The paper proposes a technique for establishing the\nnetwork's internal representations that identifies latent variables that\ncorrespond to, for example, presence of [s] and its spectral properties. By\nmanipulating these variables, we actively control the presence of [s] and its\nfrication amplitude in the generated outputs. This suggests that the network\nlearns to use latent variables as an approximation of phonetic and phonological\nrepresentations. Crucially, we observe that the dependencies learned in\ntraining extend beyond the training interval, which allows for additional\nexploration of learning representations. The paper also discusses how the\nnetwork's architecture and innovative outputs resemble and differ from\nlinguistic behavior in language acquisition, speech disorders, and speech\nerrors, and how well-understood dependencies in speech data can help us\ninterpret how neural networks learn their representations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 6 Jun 2020 20:31:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-29"}

The conditional randomization test (CRT) was recently proposed as a\nway to use distributional information about X|Z to exactly (non-asymptotically)\ncontrol Type-I error using any test statistic in any dimensionality without\nassuming anything about Y|(X,Z). This flexibility in principle allows one to\nderive powerful test statistics from complex prediction algorithms while\nmaintaining statistical validity. Yet the direct use of such advanced test\nstatistics in the CRT is prohibitively computationally expensive, especially\nwith multiple testing, due to the CRT's requirement to recompute the test\nstatistic many times on resampled data. We propose the distilled CRT, a novel\napproach to using state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms in the CRT while\ndrastically reducing the number of times those algorithms need to be run,\nthereby taking advantage of their power and the CRT's statistical guarantees\nwithout suffering the usual computational expense. In addition to distillation,\nwe propose a number of other tricks like screening and recycling computations\nto further speed up the CRT without sacrificing its high power and exact\nvalidity. Indeed, we show in simulations that all our proposals combined lead\nto a test that has similar power to the most powerful existing CRT\nimplementations but requires orders of magnitude less computation, making it a\npractical tool even for large data sets.

Here\nbasic aim is to study the properties of Gravitational Waves (GWs) in this new\nmodel. In $f(R)$ gravity metric formalism, the model shows the existence of\nscalar degree of freedom as like other $f(R)$ gravity models. Due to this\nreason, there is a scalar mode of polarization of GWs present in the theory.\nThis polarization mode exists in a mixed state, of which one is transverse\nmassless breathing mode with non-vanishing trace and the other is massive\nlongitudinal mode.

This paper proposes a novel convex combined heat and power dispatch\nmodel based on model simplification and constraint relaxation, which improves\nsolution quality and avoids assumptions on operating regimes of district\nheating systems. To alleviate mathematical complexity introduced by the\ncommonly used node method, a simplified thermal dynamic model is proposed to\ncapture temperature changes in networked pipelines. Conic and polyhedral\nrelaxations are then applied to convexify the original problems with bilinear\nand quadratic equality constraints. Furthermore, an adaptive solution algorithm\nis proposed to successively reduce relaxation gaps based on dynamic bivariate\npartitioning, improving solution optimality with desirable computational\nefficiency.

The most\npopular among them, the inverse probability weighting (IPW), assigns weights\nthat are proportional to the inverse of the conditional probability of a\nspecific treatment assignment, given observed covariates. A key requirement for\nIPW estimation is the positivity assumption, i.e., the PS must be bounded away\nfrom 0 and 1. In practice, violations of the positivity assumption often\nmanifest by the presence of limited overlap in the PS distributions between\ntreatment groups. When these practical violations occur, a small number of\nhighly influential IPW weights may lead to unstable IPW estimators, with biased\nestimates and large variances. To mitigate these issues, a number of\nalternative methods have been proposed, including IPW trimming, overlap weights\n(OW), matching weights (MW), and entropy weights (EW). Because OW, MW, and EW\ntarget the population for whom there is equipoise (and with adequate overlap)\nand their estimands depend on the true PS, a common criticism is that these\nestimators may be more sensitive to misspecifications of the PS model. In this\npaper, we conduct extensive simulation studies to compare the performances of\nIPW and IPW trimming against those of OW, MW, and EW under limited overlap and\nmisspecified propensity score models.

In this study, we establish the theoretical\nfoundation to select the penalty parameter without cross-validation based on\nbounding with a high probability the infinite norm of the gradient of the loss\nfunction at zero under the zero-feature assumption. Our approach is a\ngeneralization of the universal threshold of Donoho and Johnstone (1994) to\nnonlinear ANN learning. We perform a set of comprehensive Monte Carlo\nsimulations on a simple model, and the numerical results show the effectiveness\nof the proposed approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Jun 2020 04:46:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-09"}

Moreover, the performance of the student model could\nbe limited by the teacher model if the teacher model is not optimal. In the\nlight of collaborative learning, we study the feasibility of involving joint\nintellectual efforts from diverse perspectives of student models. In this work,\nwe introduce dual policy distillation(DPD), a student-student framework in\nwhich two learners operate on the same environment to explore different\nperspectives of the environment and extract knowledge from each other to\nenhance their learning. The key challenge in developing this dual learning\nframework is to identify the beneficial knowledge from the peer learner for\ncontemporary learning-based reinforcement learning algorithms, since it is\nunclear whether the knowledge distilled from an imperfect and noisy peer\nlearner would be helpful. To address the challenge, we theoretically justify\nthat distilling knowledge from a peer learner will lead to policy improvement\nand propose a disadvantageous distillation strategy based on the theoretical\nresults. The conducted experiments on several continuous control tasks show\nthat the proposed framework achieves superior performance with a learning-based\nagent and function approximation without the use of expensive teacher models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Jun 2020 06:49:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-09"}

By utilizing offline\nfeature learning, the siamese paradigm has recently been the leading framework\nfor high performance tracking. However, current existing siamese trackers\neither heavily rely on complicated anchor-based detection networks or lack the\nability to resist to distractors. In this paper, we propose the Siamese\nkeypoint prediction network (SiamKPN) to address these challenges. Upon a\nSiamese backbone for feature embedding, SiamKPN benefits from a cascade heatmap\nstrategy for coarse-to-fine prediction modeling. In particular, the strategy is\nimplemented by sequentially shrinking the coverage of the label heatmap along\nthe cascade to apply loose-to-strict intermediate supervisions. During\ninference, we find the predicted heatmaps of successive stages to be gradually\nconcentrated to the target and reduced to the distractors.

This setup captures settings where different\ngroups of users have their own objectives (learning tasks) but by aggregating\ntheir data with others in the same cluster (same learning task), they can\nleverage the strength in numbers in order to perform more efficient federated\nlearning. For this new framework of clustered federated learning, we propose\nthe Iterative Federated Clustering Algorithm (IFCA), which alternately\nestimates the cluster identities of the users and optimizes model parameters\nfor the user clusters via gradient descent. We analyze the convergence rate of\nthis algorithm first in a linear model with squared loss and then for generic\nstrongly convex and smooth loss functions. We show that in both settings, with\ngood initialization, IFCA is guaranteed to converge, and discuss the optimality\nof the statistical error rate. In particular, for the linear model with two\nclusters, we can guarantee that our algorithm converges as long as the\ninitialization is slightly better than random.

In brief, active inference replaces value functions with functionals of\n(Bayesian) beliefs, in the form of an expected (variational) free energy. In\nthis paper, we consider a sophisticated kind of active inference, using a\nrecursive form of expected free energy. Sophistication describes the degree to\nwhich an agent has beliefs about beliefs. We consider agents with beliefs about\nthe counterfactual consequences of action for states of affairs and beliefs\nabout those latent states.

The recursive form of the free energy\nfunctional effectively implements a deep tree search over actions and outcomes\nin the future.

When discussing how this core forms some divergences appear. First\nscenarios of planet formation predict the accretion of km-sized bodies, called\nplanetesimals, while more recent works suggest growth by accretion of pebbles,\nwhich are cm-sized objects. These two accretion models are often discussed\nseparately and we aim here at comparing the outcomes of the two models with\nidentical initial conditions. We use two distinct codes: one computing\nplanetesimal accretion, the other pebble accretion. Using a population\nsynthesis approach, we compare planet simulations and study the impact of the\ntwo solid accretion models, focussing on the formation of single planets. We\nfind that the planetesimal model predicts the formation of more giant planets,\nwhile the pebble accretion model forms more super-Earth mass planets. This is\ndue to the pebble isolation mass concept, which prevents planets formed by\npebble accretion to accrete gas efficiently before reaching Miso. This\ntranslates into a population of planets that are not heavy enough to accrete a\nconsequent envelope but that are in a mass range where type I migration is very\nefficient. We also find higher gas mass fractions for a given core mass for the\npebble model compared to the planetesimal one caused by luminosity differences.\nThis also implies planets with lower densities which could be confirmed\nobservationally. Focusing on giant planets, we conclude that the sensitivity of\ntheir formation differs: for the pebble accretion model, the time at which the\nembryos are formed, as well as the period over which solids are accreted\nstrongly impact the results, while for the planetesimal model it depends on the\nplanetesimal size and on the splitting in the amount of solids available to\nform planetesimals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Jun 2020 11:25:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-05"}

One straightforward solution is to combine the\nunsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) technique and pruning. For example, the\nmodel is first pruned on the cloud and then transferred from cloud to end by\nUDA. However, such a naive combination faces high performance degradation.\nHence this work proposes an Adversarial Double Masks based Pruning (ADMP) for\nsuch cross-domain compression. In ADMP, we construct a Knowledge Distillation\nframework not only to produce pseudo labels but also to provide a measurement\nof domain divergence as the output difference between the full-size teacher and\nthe pruned student. Unlike existing mask-based pruning works, two adversarial\nmasks, i.e. soft and hard masks, are adopted in ADMP. So ADMP can prune the\nmodel effectively while still allowing the model to extract strong\ndomain-invariant features and robust classification boundaries. During\ntraining, the Alternating Direction Multiplier Method is used to overcome the\nbinary constraint of {0,1}-masks. On Office31 and ImageCLEF-DA datasets, the\nproposed ADMP can prune 60% channels with only 0.2% and 0.3% average accuracy\nloss respectively.

The qubit\ncan either be a defect which interacts with the mechanical oscillator via the\nlinear Jaynes-Cummings interaction or a superconducting charge qubit coupled\nwith the mechanical mode via nonlinear interaction. We find that coherent\nperfect transmission (CPT), coherent perfect synthesis (CPS) and\noptomechanically induced absorption (OMIA) can be generated by suitably\nadjusting the system parameters. We find that the qubit and its interaction\nwith the mechanical oscillator emerges as a new handle to control these quantum\noptical properties. The presence of the qubit results in four points where CPT\nand CPS can be realized compared to the pure optomechanical case (i.e. in the\nabsence of qubit) where only three points are attained. This shows that the\npresence of the qubit gives us more flexibility in choosing the appropriate\nparameter regime where CPT and CPS can be attained and controlled. We also find\nthat OMIA shows three distinct peaks both in the linear and nonlinear cases. In\nthe absence of the qubit, OMIA is converted to optomechanically induced\ntransmission (OMIT).

For example, deep\nGalerkin method (DGM) uses the PDE residual in the least-squares sense as the\nloss function and a deep neural network (DNN) to approximate the PDE solution.\nIn this work, we propose a deep mixed residual method (MIM) to solve PDEs with\nhigh-order derivatives. In MIM, we first rewrite a high-order PDE into a\nfirst-order system, very much in the same spirit as local discontinuous\nGalerkin method and mixed finite element method in classical numerical methods\nfor PDEs. We then use the residual of first-order system in the least-squares\nsense as the loss function, which is in close connection with least-squares\nfinite element method. For aforementioned classical numerical methods, the\nchoice of trail and test functions is important for stability and accuracy\nissues in many cases. MIM shares this property when DNNs are employed to\napproximate unknowns functions in the first-order system. In one case, we use\nnearly the same DNN to approximate all unknown functions and in the other case,\nwe use totally different DNNs for different unknown functions. In most cases,\nMIM provides better approximations (not only for high-derivatives of the PDE\nsolution but also for the PDE solution itself) than DGM with nearly the same\nDNN and the same execution time, sometimes by more than one order of magnitude.\nWhen different DNNs are used, in many cases, MIM provides even better\napproximations than MIM with only one DNN, sometimes by more than one order of\nmagnitude. Therefore, we expect MIM to open up a possibly systematic way to\nunderstand and improve deep learning for solving PDEs from the perspective of\nclassical numerical analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Jun 2020 13:19:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-09"}

Recent online knowledge\ndistillation alleviates this limitation by collaborative learning, mutual\nlearning and online ensembling, following a one-stage end-to-end training\nfashion. However, collaborative learning and mutual learning fail to construct\nan online high-capacity teacher, whilst online ensembling ignores the\ncollaboration among branches and its logit summation impedes the further\noptimisation of the ensemble teacher.

The results show\nan enhancement of the image contrast as confirmed by three widely used metrics:\n(i) contrast improvement index, (ii) entropy, and (iii) measure of enhancement.\nThis improvement gives rise to a detectability of more lung lesions as\nidentified by two radiologists, which evaluate the images separately, and\nconfirmed by CT-scans. Based on our findings this method is proved as a\nflexible and effective way for medical image enhancement and can be used as a\npost-processing step for medical image understanding and analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Jun 2020 13:27:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-09"}

However,\nincreasing awareness of privacy concerns poses new challenges to deep learning,\nespecially for human subject related recognition such as person\nre-identification (Re-ID). In this work, we solve the Re-ID problem by\ndecentralised learning from non-shared private training data distributed at\nmultiple user sites of independent multi-domain label spaces. We propose a\nnovel paradigm called Federated Person Re-Identification (FedReID) to construct\na generalisable global model (a central server) by simultaneously learning with\nmultiple privacy-preserved local models (local clients). Specifically, each\nlocal client receives global model updates from the server and trains a local\nmodel using its local data independent from all the other clients. Then, the\ncentral server aggregates transferrable local model updates to construct a\ngeneralisable global feature embedding model without accessing local data so to\npreserve local privacy. This client-server collaborative learning process is\niteratively performed under privacy control, enabling FedReID to realise\ndecentralised learning without sharing distributed data nor collecting any\ncentralised data. Extensive experiments on ten Re-ID benchmarks show that\nFedReID achieves compelling generalisation performance beyond any locally\ntrained models without using shared training data, whilst inherently protects\nthe privacy of each local client. This is uniquely advantageous over\ncontemporary Re-ID methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Jun 2020 13:32:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Sep 2020 19:26:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 2 Jan 2021 10:44:12 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 8 Mar 2021 18:12:35 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 2021 07:39:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-08"}

While the large volume of implicit feedback\nalleviates the data sparsity issue, the downside is that they are not as clean\nin reflecting the actual satisfaction of users. For example, in E-commerce, a\nlarge portion of clicks do not translate to purchases, and many purchases end\nup with negative reviews. As such, it is of critical importance to account for\nthe inevitable noises in implicit feedback for recommender training. However,\nlittle work on recommendation has taken the noisy nature of implicit feedback\ninto consideration.\n  In this work, we explore the central theme of denoising implicit feedback for\nrecommender training. We find serious negative impacts of noisy implicit\nfeedback,i.e., fitting the noisy data prevents the recommender from learning\nthe actual user preference. Our target is to identify and prune noisy\ninteractions, so as to improve the quality of recommender training. By\nobserving the process of normal recommender training, we find that noisy\nfeedback typically has large loss values in the early stages. Inspired by this\nobservation, we propose a new training strategy namedAdaptive Denoising\nTraining(ADT), which adaptively prunes noisy interactions during training.\nSpecifically, we devise two paradigms for adaptive loss formulation: Truncated\nLoss that discards the large-loss samples with a dynamic threshold in each\niteration; and reweighted Loss that adaptively lowers the weight of large-loss\nsamples. We instantiate the two paradigms on the widely used binary\ncross-entropy loss and test the proposed ADT strategies on three representative\nrecommenders.

This is an\nimprovement when $s < \\log_2 (d-1)$, which corresponds to RBMs with sparse\nlatent variables. Furthermore, we give a version of this learning algorithm\nthat recovers a model with small prediction error and whose sample complexity\nis independent of the minimum potential in the Markov Random Field of the\nobserved variables. This is of interest because the sample complexity of\ncurrent algorithms scales with the inverse of the minimum potential, which\ncannot be controlled in terms of natural properties of the RBM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Jun 2020 14:42:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 17 Oct 2020 18:54:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-20"}

In this article, aiming to understand the\nfundamental roots of this difficulty, we strip the problem to the bare bones\nand focus on Boolean conjunctive queries mediated by a simple covering axiom\nstating that one class is covered by the union of two other classes. We show\nthat, on the one hand, these rudimentary ontology-mediated queries, called\ndisjunctive sirups (or d-sirups), capture many features and difficulties of the\ngeneral case. For example, answering d-sirups is Pi^p_2-complete for combined\ncomplexity and can be in AC0 or LogSpace-, NL-, P-, or coNP-complete for data\ncomplexity (with the problem of recognising FO-rewritability of d-sirups being\n2ExpTime-hard); some d-sirups only have exponential-size resolution proofs,\nsome only double-exponential-size positive existential FO-rewritings and\nsingle-exponential-size nonrecursive datalog rewritings.

In this paper, we\npresent a neural architecture for building deep active inference agents\noperating in complex, continuous state-spaces using multiple forms of\nMonte-Carlo (MC) sampling. For this, we introduce a number of techniques, novel\nto active inference. These include: i) selecting free-energy-optimal policies\nvia MC tree search, ii) approximating this optimal policy distribution via a\nfeed-forward `habitual' network, iii) predicting future parameter belief\nupdates using MC dropouts and, finally, iv) optimizing state transition\nprecision (a high-end form of attention).

A\nsecond methods involves a chi-squared minimization together with a prescription\nfor determining the regions of statistical confidence in addition to the\nbest-fitting value. A third method uses a Bayesian inference technique that\nemploys a Monte-Carlo Markov-chain (MCMC) calculation from which an analysis of\nthe posterior distributions provide estimates of the mean and regions of high\nprobability density. Using these three methods, observations of\nextreme-ultraviolet spectral lines originating from regions of the quiet Sun\nhave been analyzed. The quantitative chi-squared minimization and MCMC sampling\nprovide results that are generally in good agreement, especially for sets of\nlines of ions that have L-function plots that suggest that a robust analysis\nmight be possible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Jun 2020 15:47:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-17"}

In this paper, we propose the\nSpatial-Temporal Dynamic Graph Attention Network (STDGAT), a novel ride-hailing\ndemand prediction method. Based on the attention mechanism of GAT, STDGAT\nextracts different pair-wise correlations to achieve the adaptive importance\nallocation for different neighbor regions. Moreover, in STDGAT, we design a\nnovel time-specific commuting-based graph attention mode to construct a dynamic\ngraph structure for capturing the dynamic time-specific spatial relationships\nthroughout the timeline. Extensive experiments are conducted on a real-world\nride-hailing demand dataset, and the experimental results demonstrate the\nsignificant improvement of our method on three evaluation metrics RMSE, MAPE\nand MAE over state-of-the-art baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Jun 2020 13:00:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2020 08:30:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 28 May 2021 19:53:56 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 17 Apr 2022 01:41:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-19"}

Traditionally, those systems were small and\nself-contained, and the main challenge for model-based evaluation has been the\nefficiency of the solution process. Recently, the problem of specifying and\nmaintaining complex models has increasingly gained attention, as modern systems\nare characterized by many components and complex interactions. Components share\nsimilarities, but also exhibit variations in their behavior due to different\nconfigurations or roles in the system. From the modeling perspective,\nvariations lead to replicating and altering a small set of base models multiple\ntimes. Variability is taken into account only informally, by defining a sample\nmodel and explaining its possible variations. In this paper we address the\nproblem of including variability in performability models, focusing on\nStochastic Activity Networks (SANs). We introduce the formal definition of\nStochastic Activity Networks Templates (SAN-T), a formalism based on SANs with\nthe addition of variability aspects. Differently from other approaches,\nparameters can also affect the structure of the model, like the number of cases\nof activities. We apply the SAN-T formalism to the modeling of the backbone\nnetwork of an environmental monitoring infrastructure. In particular, we show\nhow existing SAN models from the literature can be generalized using the newly\nintroduced formalism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 7 Jun 2020 03:07:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2021 16:31:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-25"}
