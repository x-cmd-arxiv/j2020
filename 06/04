In particular, we are interested in\ntesting a refined version -- the Emergent String Conjecture, in settings with\n4d $N=1$ supersymmetry. We find that a weakly coupled, tensionless fundamental\nheterotic string does emerge at the infinite distance limit characterized by\nshrinking the $K3$-fibre in a TCS $G_2$ manifold. Such a fundamental\ntensionless string leads to the parametrically leading infinite tower of\nasymptotically massless states, which is in line with the Emergent String\nConjecture. The tensionless string, however, receives quantum corrections. We\ncheck that these quantum corrections do modify the volume of the shrinking\nK3-fibre via string duality and hence make the string regain a non-vanishing\ntension at the quantum level, leading to a decompactification. Geometrically,\nthe quantum corrections modify the metric of the classical moduli space and are\nexpected to obstruct the infinite distance limit. We also comment on another\npossible type of infinite distance limit in TCS $G_2$ compactifications, which\nmight lead to a weakly coupled fundamental type II string theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jun 2020 16:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 2020 00:31:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-28"}

In this paper, we propose a deep neural\nnetwork, called RODE-Net, to tackle such challenge by fitting a symbolic\nexpression of the differential equation and the distribution of parameters\nsimultaneously. To train the RODE-Net, we first estimate the parameters of the\nunknown RODE using the symbolic networks \\cite{long2019pde} by solving a set of\ndeterministic inverse problems based on the measured data, and use a generative\nadversarial network (GAN) to estimate the true distribution of the RODE's\nparameters.

Numerical results show that the proposed RODE-Net can well\nestimate the distribution of model parameters using simulated data and can make\nreliable predictions.

We consider the\ndynamic variant of this problem, in which we are to maintain two dynamic\nstrings $S$ and $T$, each of length at most $n$, that undergo substitutions of\nletters, in order to be able to return a longest common substring after each\nsubstitution. Recently, Amir et al. [ESA 2019] presented a solution for this\nproblem that needs only $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(n^{2/3})$ time per update. This\nbrought the challenge of determining whether there exists a faster solution\nwith polylogarithmic update time, or (as is the case for other dynamic\nproblems), we should expect a polynomial (conditional) lower bound. We answer\nthis question by designing a significantly faster algorithm that processes each\nsubstitution in amortized $\\log^{\\mathcal{O}(1)} n$ time with high probability.\nOur solution relies on exploiting the local consistency of the parsing of a\ncollection of dynamic strings due to Gawrychowski et al. [SODA 2018], and on\nmaintaining two dynamic trees with labeled bicolored leaves, so that after each\nupdate we can report a pair of nodes, one from each tree, of maximum combined\nweight, which have at least one common leaf-descendant of each color. We\ncomplement this with a lower bound of $\\Omega(\\log n/ \\log\\log n)$ for the\nupdate time of any polynomial-size data structure that maintains the LCS of two\ndynamic strings, and the same lower bound for the update time of any data\nstructure of size $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(n)$ that maintains the LCS of a static\nand a dynamic string. Both lower bounds hold even allowing amortization and\nrandomization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jun 2020 17:33:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-04"}

SGN is a\nsecond-order optimization method, with efficient iterations, that we\ndemonstrate to often require substantially fewer iterations than standard SGD\nto converge. As the name suggests, SGN uses a Gauss-Newton approximation for\nthe Hessian matrix, and, in order to compute an approximate search direction,\nrelies on the conjugate gradient method combined with forward and reverse\nautomatic differentiation. Despite the success of SGD and its first-order\nvariants, and despite Hessian-free methods based on the Gauss-Newton Hessian\napproximation having been already theoretically proposed as practical methods\nfor training DNNs, we believe that SGN has a lot of undiscovered and yet not\nfully displayed potential in big mini-batch scenarios. For this setting, we\ndemonstrate that SGN does not only substantially improve over SGD in terms of\nthe number of iterations, but also in terms of runtime. This is made possible\nby an efficient, easy-to-use and flexible implementation of SGN we propose in\nthe Theano deep learning platform, which, unlike Tensorflow and Pytorch,\nsupports forward automatic differentiation. This enables researchers to further\nstudy and improve this promising optimization technique and hopefully\nreconsider stochastic second-order methods as competitive optimization\ntechniques for training DNNs; we also hope that the promise of SGN may lead to\nforward automatic differentiation being added to Tensorflow or Pytorch. Our\nresults also show that in big mini-batch scenarios SGN is more robust than SGD\nwith respect to its hyperparameters (we never had to tune its step-size for our\nbenchmarks!), which eases the expensive process of hyperparameter tuning that\nis instead crucial for the performance of first-order methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jun 2020 17:35:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2020 08:30:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 6 Jun 2020 07:01:50 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2020 08:58:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-11"}

Therefore, we\ncan only select a limited number of measurement angles and assign each of them\nlimited amount of dose. Traditional methods such as compressed sensing usually\nrandomly select the angles and equally distribute the allowed dose on them.

Among them, we select\nthe physically relevant ones, by implementing in the operator construction the\npresence of the specific short-scale structure suggested by formal physical\narguments that are ubiquitous in the physical literature on zero-range methods.\nThis is done by applying at different stages the self-adjoint extension schemes\na la Kre{\\u\\i}n-Vi\\v{s}ik-Birman and a la von Neumann. We produce a class of\ncanonical models for which we also analyse the structure of the negative bound\nstates. Bosonicity and zero range combined together make such canonical models\ndisplay the typical Thomas and Efimov spectra, i.e., sequence of energy\neigenvalues accumulating to both minus infinity and zero. We also discuss a\ntype of regularisation that prevents such spectral instability while retaining\nan effective short-scale pattern. Beside the operator qualification, we also\npresent the associated energy quadratic forms. We structured our analysis so as\nto clarify certain steps of the operator-theoretic construction that are\nnotoriously subtle for the correct identification of a domain of\nself-adjointness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jun 2020 17:54:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Jul 2020 08:45:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 30 Dec 2020 08:36:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-26"}

Collective chaos was suggested to underlie the complex ongoing\ndynamics observed in cerebral cortical circuits and determine the impact and\nprocessing of incoming information streams. In dissipative systems, chaotic\ndynamics takes place on a subset of phase space of reduced dimensionality and\nis organized by a complex tangle of stable, neutral and unstable manifolds. Key\ntopological invariants of this phase space structure such as attractor\ndimension, and Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy so far remained elusive.\n  Here we calculate the complete Lyapunov spectrum of recurrent neural\nnetworks. We show that chaos in these networks is extensive with a\nsize-invariant Lyapunov spectrum and characterized by attractor dimensions much\nsmaller than the number of phase space dimensions. We find that near the onset\nof chaos, for very intense chaos, and discrete-time dynamics, random matrix\ntheory provides analytical approximations to the full Lyapunov spectrum. We\nshow that a generalized time-reversal symmetry of the network dynamics induces\na point-symmetry of the Lyapunov spectrum reminiscent of the symplectic\nstructure of chaotic Hamiltonian systems. Fluctuating input reduces both the\nentropy rate and the attractor dimension. For trained recurrent networks, we\nfind that Lyapunov spectrum analysis provides a quantification of error\npropagation and stability achieved. Our methods apply to systems of arbitrary\nconnectivity, and we describe a comprehensive set of controls for the accuracy\nand convergence of Lyapunov exponents.\n  Our results open a novel avenue for characterizing the complex dynamics of\nrecurrent neural networks and the geometry of the corresponding chaotic\nattractors. They also highlight the potential of Lyapunov spectrum analysis as\na diagnostic for machine learning applications of recurrent networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jun 2020 17:55:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-04"}

The user navigates the lecture video\ncontent by viewing a single frame visual and textual summary of each segment.\nThe paper presents a novel methodology to generate the visual summary of a\nlecture video segment by computing similarities between images extracted from\nthe segment and employing a graph-based algorithm to identify the subset of\nmost representative images. The results from this research are integrated into\na real-world lecture video management portal called Videopoints. To collect\nground truth for evaluation, a survey was conducted where multiple users\nmanually provided visual summaries for 40 lecture video segments. The users\nalso stated whether any images were not selected for the summary because they\nwere similar to other selected images. The graph based algorithm for\nidentifying summary images achieves 78% precision and 72% F1-measure with\nfrequently selected images as the ground truth, and 94% precision and 72%\nF1-measure with the union of all user selected images as the ground truth.

Here\nwe argue and demonstrate that ILC methods can also be applied to data from\nabsolutely-calibrated CMB experiments to extract average-sky signals in\naddition to the conventional CMB anisotropies. The performance of the simple\nILC method is, however, limited, but can be significantly improved by adding\nconstraints informed by physics and existing empirical information. In recent\nwork, a moment description has been introduced as a technique of carrying out\nhigh precision modeling of foregrounds in the presence of inevitable averaging\neffects. We combine these two approaches to construct a heavily constrained\nform of the ILC, dubbed \\milc, which can be used to recover tiny monopolar\nspectral distortion signals in the presence of realistic foregrounds and\ninstrumental noise. This is a first demonstration for measurements of the\nmonopolar and anisotropic spectral distortion signals using ILC and extended\nmoment methods.

Using the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemiological\nmodel we establish that under some mild assumptions the growth rate of COVID-19\ndeaths is a time-delayed approximation of the growth rate of COVID-19\ninfections. We then hypothesize that the growth rate of COVID-19 infections is\na function of population mobility, which leads to a statistical model that\npredicts the growth rate of COVID-19 deaths as a delayed function of population\nmobility. The parameters of the statistical model directly reveal the growth\nrate of infections, the mobility-dependent transmission rate, the\nmobility-independent recovery rate, and the critical mobility, below which\nCOVID-19 growth rate becomes negative. We fitted the proposed statistical model\non publicly available data from 14 countries where daily death counts exceeded\n100 for more than 3 days as of May 6th, 2020. The publicly available Google\nMobility Index (GMI) was used as a measure of population mobility at the\ncountry level. Our results show that the growth rate of COVID-19 deaths can be\naccurately estimated 20 days ahead as a quadratic function of the transit\ncategory of GMI (adjusted R-squared = 0.784). The estimated 95% confidence\ninterval for the critical mobility is in the range between 36.1% and 47.6% of\nthe pre-COVID-19 mobility. This result indicates that a significant reduction\nin population mobility is needed to reverse the growth of COVID-19 epidemic.\nMoreover, the quantitative relationship established herein suggests that a\nreadily available, population-level metric such as GMI can be a useful\nindicator of the course of COVID-19 epidemic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jun 2020 18:10:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-05"}

When GMDs occur, they can cause geomagnetically-induced\ncurrents (GICs), which saturate transformers, induce hot-spot heating, and\nincrease reactive power losses in the transmission grid. Furthermore,\nuncertainty in the magnitude and orientation of the geo-electric field, and\ninsufficient historical data make the problem of mitigating the effects of\nuncertain GMDs challenging. In this paper, we propose a novel distributionally\nrobust optimization (DRO) approach that models uncertain GMDs and mitigates the\neffects of GICs on electric grids. This is achieved via a set of mitigation\nactions (e.g., line switching, locating blocking devices, generator re-dispatch\nand load shedding), prior to the GMD event, such that the worst-case\nexpectation of the system cost is minimized. To this end, we develop a\ncolumn-and-constraint generation algorithm that solves a sequence of\nmixed-integer second-order conic programs to handle the underlying convex\nsupport set of the uncertain GMDs.

Our simulations feature Rayleigh-Taylor fingers that grow\nfrom the cocoon into the jet, mix cocoon with jet material and destabilize the\njet. The mixing gives rise to a previously unidentified region sheathing the\njet from the cocoon, which we denote the jet-cocoon interface (JCI). long GRBs\nundergo strong mixing, resulting in most of the jet energy to drift into the\nJCI, while in short GRBs weaker mixing is possible, leading to a comparable\namount of energy in the two components. Remarkably, the jet structure (jet-core\nplus JCI) can be characterized by simple universal angular power-law\ndistributions, with power-law indices that depend solely on the mixing level.\nThis result supports the commonly used power-law angular distribution, and\ndisfavors Gaussian jets. At larger angles, where the cocoon dominates, the\nstructure is more complex.

We propose the\nAdaptive Checkpoint Adjoint (ACA) method: in automatic differentiation, ACA\napplies a trajectory checkpoint strategy which records the forward-mode\ntrajectory as the reverse-mode trajectory to guarantee accuracy; ACA deletes\nredundant components for shallow computation graphs; and ACA supports adaptive\nsolvers. On image classification tasks, compared with the adjoint and naive\nmethod, ACA achieves half the error rate in half the training time; NODE\ntrained with ACA outperforms ResNet in both accuracy and test-retest\nreliability. On time-series modeling, ACA outperforms competing methods.\nFinally, in an example of the three-body problem, we show NODE with ACA can\nincorporate physical knowledge to achieve better accuracy. We provide the\nPyTorch implementation of ACA:\n\\url{https://github.com/juntang-zhuang/torch-ACA}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jun 2020 19:48:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-07"}

However, such a reduced-order model may be a bad approximation to the\nfull-order system, if the initial condition is not zero. In the literature\nthere are several attempts for modified reduction methods at the price of\nhaving no error bound or only a posteriori error bounds which are often too\nexpensive to evaluate. In this work we propose a new balancing procedure that\nis based on a shift transformation on the state. We first derive a joint\nprojection reduced-order model in which the part of the system depending only\non the input and the one depending only on the initial value are reduced at\nonce and we prove an a priori error bound. With this result at hand, we derive\na separate projection procedure in which the two parts are reduced separately.\nThis gives the freedom to choose different reduction orders for the different\nsubsystems. Moreover, we discuss how the reduced-order models can be\nconstructed in practice. Since the error bounds are parameter-dependent we show\nhow they can be optimized efficiently. We conclude this paper by comparing our\nresults with the ones from the literature by a series of numerical experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jun 2020 19:51:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2022 11:27:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-16"}

However, due to resource constraints\nand privacy challenges, edge IoT devices may not be able to transmit their\ncollected data to a central controller for training machine learning models. To\novercome this challenge, federated learning (FL) has been proposed as a means\nfor enabling edge devices to train a shared machine learning model without data\nexchanges thus reducing communication overhead and preserving data privacy.\nHowever, Google's seminal FL algorithm requires all devices to be directly\nconnected with a central controller, which significantly limits its application\nscenarios. In this context, this paper introduces a novel FL framework, called\ncollaborative FL (CFL), which enables edge devices to implement FL with less\nreliance on a central controller. The fundamentals of this framework are\ndeveloped and then, a number of communication techniques are proposed so as to\nimprove the performance of CFL. To this end, an overview of centralized\nlearning, Google's seminal FL, and CFL is first presented. For each type of\nlearning, the basic architecture as well as its advantages, drawbacks, and\nusage conditions are introduced. Then, three CFL performance metrics are\npresented and a suite of communication techniques ranging from network\nformation, device scheduling, mobility management, and coding is introduced to\noptimize the performance of CFL. For each technique, future research\nopportunities are also discussed. In a nutshell, this article will showcase how\nthe proposed CFL framework can be effectively implemented at the edge of\nlarge-scale wireless systems such as the Internet of Things.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jun 2020 20:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 29 Aug 2020 21:36:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-01"}

We aimed to develop a passive RF shimming technique\nusing an inductively coupled RF resonator array to improve brain MRI at 7T,\nfocusing of cerebellum. Method: an inductively coupled RF resonator array was\ndesigned for placing inside the commercial head coil to enhance the transmit\nfield homogeneity and to improve the receive signal sensitivity. Each element\nof the array is a coupled-split-ring resonator (CSRR), which they are decoupled\nfor each other using critical overlap technique.

Transfer Learning (TL) models have\nbeen proposed to resolve the issue of small dataset size by letting the model\ntrain on a bigger, task-related reference dataset and then fine-tune on a\nsmaller, task-specific dataset. In this work, we apply a transfer learning\napproach to improve predictive power in noisy data systems with large variable\nconfidence datasets.

Using computer\nsimulations, we illustrate how the addition of a small fraction of purely\nrepulsive self-propelled colloids, a technique referred to as active doping,\ncan prevent the formation of this metastable gel state and drive the system\ntoward its thermodynamically favored crystalline target structure.

Contrary\nto the unregularized case, for which the explicit form is given by the\nWasserstein-Bures distance, the closed form we obtain is differentiable\neverywhere, even for Gaussians with degenerate covariance matrices.

This extension leads to a\nclosed form expression for unbalanced Gaussians as well, and highlights the\nmass transportation / destruction trade-off seen in unbalanced optimal\ntransport. Moreover, in both settings, we show that the optimal transportation\nplans are (scaled) Gaussians and provide analytical formulas of their\nparameters.

In addition, operation with low energy\nthresholds, which is essential for a number of new phenomenon searches, is\nusually limited by the crystal light yield; in these cases higher light yields\ncan translate into lower thresholds that improve the experimental sensitivity.\nHere we describe the development of an encapsulation technique that simplifies\nthe overall design by attaching the photo sensors directly to the crystal so\nthat light losses are minimized.

Addressing these constraints, we\nperformed 450 N-body simulations of terrestrial planet formation based on\nnarrow protoplanetary disks with mass confined to 0.7-1.0 au. We identified 164\nanalogue systems, but only 24 systems contained Mercury analogues, and eight\nsystems were 4-P ones. We found that narrow disks containing a small number of\nembryos with individual masses comparable to that of Mars and the giant planets\non their current orbits yielded the best prospects for satisfying those\nconstraints. However, serious shortcomings remain. The formation of Mercury\nanalogues and 4-P systems was too inefficient (5% and 2%, respectively), and\nmost Venus-to-Earth analogue mass ratios were incorrect. Mercury and Venus\nanalogues also formed too close to each other (~0.15-0.21 au) compared to\nreality (0.34 au). Similarly, the mutual distances between the Venus and Earth\nanalogues were greater than those observed (0.34 vs. 0.28 au). Furthermore, the\nVenus-Earth pair was not reproduced in orbital-mass space statistically.\nOverall, our results suggest serious problems with using narrow disks to\nexplain the inner solar system. In particular, the formation of Mercury remains\nan outstanding problem for terrestrial planet formation models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2020 04:08:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-17"}

Self-ion implantation is commonly used to mimic\nneutron irradiation damage, however an interesting question concerns the effect\nof ion energy on the resulting damage structures. The reduction in the\nthickness of the implanted layer as the implantation energy is reduced results\nin the significant quandary: Does one attempt to match the primary knock-on\natom energy produced during neutron irradiation or implant at a much higher\nenergy, such that a thicker damage layer is produced? Here we address this\nquestion by measuring the full strain tensor for two ion implantation energies,\n2 MeV and 20 MeV in self-ion implanted tungsten, a critical material for the\nfirst wall and divertor of fusion reactors. A comparison of 2 MeV and 20 MeV\nimplanted samples is shown to result in similar lattice swelling.\nMulti-reflection Bragg coherent diffractive imaging (MBCDI) shows that\nimplantation induced strain is in fact heterogeneous at the nanoscale,\nsuggesting that there is a non-uniform distribution of defects, an observation\nthat is not fully captured by micro-beam Laue diffraction.

Class 0 protostars represent the earliest evolutionary stage of\nsolar-type stars, during which the majority of the system mass resides in an\ninfalling envelope of gas and dust and is not yet in the central, nascent star.\nAlthough X-rays are a key signature of magnetic activity in more evolved\nprotostars and young stars, whether such magnetic activity is present at the\nClass 0 stage is still debated. Aims. We aim to detect a bona fide Class 0\nprotostar in X-rays. Methods. We observed HOPS 383 in 2017 December in X-rays\nwith the Chandra X-ray Observatory ($\\sim$84 ks) and in near-infrared imaging\nwith the Southern Astrophysical Research telescope. Results. HOPS 383 was\ndetected in X-rays during a powerful flare. This hard (E > 2 keV) X-ray\ncounterpart was spatially coincident with the northwest 4 cm component of HOPS\n383, which would be the base of the radio thermal jet launched by HOPS 383. The\nflare duration was $\\sim$3.3 h; at the peak, the X-ray luminosity reached\n$\\sim$4 x 1E31 erg s --1 in the 2-8 keV energy band, a level at least an order\nof magnitude larger than that of the undetected quiescent emission from HOPS\n383. The X-ray flare spectrum is highly absorbed (NH $\\sim$ 7 x 1E23 cm --2),\nand it displays a 6.4 keV emission line with an equivalent width of $\\sim$1.1\nkeV, arising from neutral or low-ionization iron. Conclusions. The detection of\na powerful X-ray flare from HOPS 383 constitutes direct proof that magnetic\nactivity can be present at the earliest formative stages of solar-type stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2020 07:45:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-24"}

In contrast to\nVSNs, social sensing is more pervasive, but one of its key limitations lies in\nits inconsistent reliability stemming from the data contributed by unreliable\nhuman sensors. In this paper, we present DASC, a road Damage-Aware\nSocial-media-driven Car sensing framework that exploits the collective power of\nsocial sensing and VSNs for reliable disaster response applications. However,\nintegrating VSNs with social sensing introduces a new set of challenges: i) How\nto leverage noisy and unreliable social signals to route the vehicles to\naccurate regions of interest? ii) How to tackle the inconsistent availability\n(e.g., churns) caused by car drivers being rational actors? iii) How to\nefficiently guide the cars to the event locations with little prior knowledge\nof the road damage caused by the disaster, while also handling the dynamics of\nthe physical world and social media? The DASC framework addresses the above\nchallenges by establishing a novel hybrid social-car sensing system that\nemploys techniques from game theory, feedback control, and Markov Decision\nProcess (MDP). In particular, DASC distills signals emitted from social media\nand discovers the road damages to effectively drive cars to target areas for\nverifying emergency events. We implement and evaluate DASC in a reputed vehicle\nsimulator that can emulate real-world disaster response scenarios. The results\nof a real-world application demonstrate the superiority of DASC over current\nVSNs-based solutions in detection accuracy and efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2020 07:55:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-05"}

While in most\ncases the segmentation uncertainty is around the border of structures of\ninterest, there can also be considerable inter-rater differences. The class of\nconditional variational autoencoders (cVAE) offers a principled approach to\ninferring distributions over plausible segmentations that are conditioned on\ninput images. Segmentation uncertainty estimated from samples of such\ndistributions can be more informative than using pixel level probability\nscores. In this work, we propose a novel conditional generative model that is\nbased on conditional Normalizing Flow (cFlow). The basic idea is to increase\nthe expressivity of the cVAE by introducing a cFlow transformation step after\nthe encoder. This yields improved approximations of the latent posterior\ndistribution, allowing the model to capture richer segmentation variations.\nWith this we show that the quality and diversity of samples obtained from our\nconditional generative model is enhanced.

Furthermore, the residual influence of the dipolar\ninteraction on the dispersion relation and on the evaluation of the Heisenberg\nexchange parameter is demonstrated. In addition, an experimental analysis of\nthe DMI on the spin-wave lifetime is presented. All these parameters play a\ncrucial role in designing skyrmionic or spin-orbitronic devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2020 08:13:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-05"}

High-quality rPPG pulse signals are\nurgently demanded in many fields, such as health monitoring and emotion\nrecognition. However, most of the existing rPPG methods can only be used to get\naverage heart rate (HR) values due to the limitation of inaccurate pulse\nsignals. In this paper, a new framework based on generative adversarial\nnetwork, called PulseGAN, is introduced to generate realistic rPPG pulse\nsignals through denoising the chrominance signals. Considering that the cardiac\nsignal is quasi-periodic and has apparent time-frequency characteristics, the\nerror losses defined in time and spectrum domains are both employed with the\nadversarial loss to enforce the model generating accurate pulse waveforms as\nits reference. The proposed framework is tested on the public UBFC-RPPG\ndatabase in both within-database and cross-database configurations. The results\nshow that the PulseGAN framework can effectively improve the waveform quality,\nthereby enhancing the accuracy of HR, the heart rate variability (HRV) and the\ninterbeat interval (IBI).

This article explains this behavior by studying the random\npartition posterior in a non-standard setting with a fixed sample size and\nincreasing data dimensionality. We provide conditions under which the finite\nsample posterior tends to either assign every observation to a different\ncluster or all observations to the same cluster as the dimension grows.\nInterestingly, the conditions do not depend on the choice of clustering prior,\nas long as all possible partitions of observations into clusters have positive\nprior probabilities, and hold irrespective of the true data-generating model.\nWe then propose a class of latent mixtures for Bayesian clustering (Lamb) on a\nset of low-dimensional latent variables inducing a partition on the observed\ndata.

To address the\nchallenge, we propose a data pre-processing method that rectifies training\nimages by removing their relative rotations for effective learning. The\nsignificantly improved performance validates our motivation. Towards end-to-end\nlearning without requiring pre-processing, we propose an Auto-Rectify Network\nwith novel loss functions, which can automatically learn to rectify images\nduring training. Consequently, our results outperform the previous unsupervised\nSOTA method by a large margin on the challenging NYUv2 dataset. We also\ndemonstrate the generalization of our trained model in ScanNet and Make3D, and\nthe universality of our proposed learning method on 7-Scenes and KITTI\ndatasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2020 08:59:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Dec 2021 06:17:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-15"}

Since the observed SED curvature is\nrelated to an intrinsic curvature in emitting electron energy distribution\n(EED), we study this question by employing a log-parabolic EED with a curvature\nparameter and peak energy to model the quasi-simultaneous broadband SEDs of\nselected blazars in Fermi-LAT Bright AGN Sample (LBAS) using synchrotron and\ninverse Compton (IC) processes. We find that log-parabolic IC model can\nsuccessfully explain the emission in all blazars in our sample. On average,\nFSRQs have higher magnetic field, Doppler factor, and curvature than BL Lac\nobjects. The BL Lac objects show an anticorrelation between the curvature\nparameter of the EED and its peak energy, which is a signature of stochastic\nacceleration. FSRQs do not manifest such correlation and rather show a mild\npositive relationship between these parameters. This suggests that the\nevolution of spectral curvature in the BL Lac objects is dominated by a strong\nstochastic acceleration component, whereas the curvature in FSRQs evolves in a\ncooling dominated regime due to an additional external Compton (EC) component.\nThe strong cooling in FSRQs not only restricts the electron peak energy but\nalso adds extra curvature to the high energy tail of emitting EED. Since the\ncurvature decreases from FSRQs toward high peak BL Lac objects (HBLs), opposite\nto peak energy, the curvature parameter can be considered a third parameter of\nthe blazar sequence in addition to peak frequency and luminosity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2020 09:24:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2020 16:28:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-29"}

The subsequent accretion of\nsatellites brings in ex-situ material, growing these nuggets in size and mass\nto appear as the massive early-type galaxies (ETGs) we see locally.

First, it is shown that a particular structure of\nthe errors in a finite precision implementation of an algorithm allows for a\nmuch better measure of sensitivity and that computation with high accuracy is\npossible despite a large classical condition number. Such structured errors\nincurred by finite precision computation are in some algorithms e.g. entry-wise\nor column-wise small, which is much better than the usually considered errors\nthat are in general small only when measured in the Frobenius matrix norm.\nSpecially tailored perturbation theory for such structured perturbations of\nHermitian matrices guarantees much better bounds for the relative errors in the\ncomputed eigenvalues. % Secondly, we review an unconventional approach to\naccurate computation of the singular values and eigenvalues of some notoriously\nill-conditioned structured matrices, such as e.g. Cauchy, Vandermonde and\nHankel matrices. The distinctive feature of accurate algorithms is using the\nintrinsic parameters that define such matrices to obtain a non-orthogonal\nfactorization, such as the \\textsf{LDU} factorization, and then computing the\nsingular values of the product of thus computed factors.

Classical damage models allow predictions of\ndamage during deformation based on considerations of the material as an\nisotropic continuum. Here, we investigate their validity in a dual phase\nmicrostructure that is locally dominated by its microstructural morphological\ncomplexity based on a statistical ensemble of thousands of individual voids\nformed under different stress states. For this purpose, we combined a\ncalibrated material model incorporating damage formation to assess the local\nstress state in samples with different notch geometries and high-resolution\nelectron microscopy of large areas using a deep learning-based automated\nmicrograph analysis to detect and classify microstructural voids according to\ntheir source of origin.

We found that the applied plastic strain is the major influence on\nthe overall number, and therefore the nucleation of new voids, while\ntriaxiality correlates with the median void size, supporting its proposed\ninfluence on void growth. In contrast, coalescence of voids leading to failure\nappears related to local instabilities in the form of shear band formation and\nis therefore only indirectly determined by the global stress state in that it\ndetermines the global distribution, density and size of voids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2020 11:05:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-05"}

Previous\nresearches have extensively studied the problem of height estimation from\naerial images based on stereo or multi-view image matching. These methods\nrequire two or more images from different perspectives to reconstruct 3D\ncoordinates with camera information provided. In this paper, we deal with the\nambiguous and unsolved problem of height estimation from a single aerial image.\nDriven by the great success of deep learning, especially deep convolution\nneural networks (CNNs), some researches have proposed to estimate height\ninformation from a single aerial image by training a deep CNN model with\nlarge-scale annotated datasets. These methods treat height estimation as a\nregression problem and directly use an encoder-decoder network to regress the\nheight values. In this paper, we proposed to divide height values into\nspacing-increasing intervals and transform the regression problem into an\nordinal regression problem, using an ordinal loss for network training. To\nenable multi-scale feature extraction, we further incorporate an Atrous Spatial\nPyramid Pooling (ASPP) module to extract features from multiple dilated\nconvolution layers. After that, a post-processing technique is designed to\ntransform the predicted height map of each patch into a seamless height map.\nFinally, we conduct extensive experiments on ISPRS Vaihingen and Potsdam\ndatasets.

We aim to determine if disks in the\nembedded stage of star formation contain enough dust to explain the solid\ncontent of the most massive exoplanets. We use Atacama Large\nMillimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 6 observations of embedded disks in\nthe Perseus star-forming region together with Very Large Array (VLA) Ka-band (9\nmm) data to provide a robust estimate of dust disk masses from the flux\ndensities. Using the DIANA opacity model including large grains, with a dust\nopacity value of $\\kappa_{\\rm 9\\ mm}$ = 0.28 cm$^{2}$ g$^{-1}$, the median dust\nmasses of the embedded disks in Perseus are 158 M$_\\oplus$ for Class 0 and 52\nM$_\\oplus$ for Class I from the VLA fluxes.

The dust masses of young Class 0\nand I disks are larger by at least a factor of 10 and 3, respectively, compared\nwith dust masses inferred for Class II disks in Lupus and other regions. The\ndust masses of Class 0 and I disks in Perseus derived from the VLA data are\nhigh enough to produce the observed exoplanet systems with efficiencies\nacceptable by planet formation models: the solid content in observed giant\nexoplanets can be explained if planet formation starts in Class 0 phase with an\nefficiency of $\\sim$ 15%.

We propose\nbranching the action producing layer in the actor to learn the tuning parameter\ncontrolling the activation layer (e.g. Tanh and Sigmoid). The learned\nparameters are then used to create tailored activation functions for each\nactuator. We ran experiments on three OpenAI Gym environments, i.e.\nPendulum-v0, LunarLanderContinuous-v2 and BipedalWalker-v2. Results have shown\nan average of 23.15% and 33.80% increase in total episode reward of the\nLunarLanderContinuous-v2 and BipedalWalker-v2 environments, respectively. There\nwas no significant improvement in Pendulum-v0 environment but the proposed\nmethod produces a more stable actuation signal compared to the state-of-the-art\nmethod. The proposed method allows the reinforcement learning actor to produce\nmore robust actions that accommodate the discrepancy in the actuators' response\nfunctions. This is particularly useful for real life scenarios where actuators\nexhibit different response functions depending on the load and the interaction\nwith the environment. This also simplifies the transfer learning problem by\nfine tuning the parameterised activation layers instead of retraining the\nentire policy every time an actuator is replaced. Finally, the proposed method\nwould allow better accommodation to biological actuators (e.g. muscles) in\nbiomechanical systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2020 12:27:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-05"}

Two players take\nturns in constructing a maximal enclaveless set $S$, where one player,\nMaximizer, tries to maximize $|S|$ and one player, Minimizer, tries to\nminimize~$|S|$.

Recently, cepstral analysis has been used with\ntraditional absorption spectrometers to create a modified form of the\ntime-domain molecular free-induction decay (m-FID) signal which can be analyzed\nindependently from Io. However, independent analysis of the molecular signature\nis not possible when the baseline intensity and molecular response do not\nseparate well in the time domain, which is typical when using\ninjection-current-tuned lasers (e.g., quantum cascade lasers) and other light\nsources with pronounced intensity tuning. In contrast, the method presented\nhere is applicable to all light sources since it determines gas properties by\nleast-squares fitting a simulated m-FID signal to the measured m-FID signal in\nthe time domain. This method is insensitive to errors in the estimated Io which\nvary slowly with optical frequency and, therefore, decay rapidly in the time\ndomain. The benefits provided by this method are demonstrated via\nscanned-wavelength direct-absorption measurements acquired with a\ndistributed-feedback (DFB) quantum-cascade laser (QCL). The wavelength of a DFB\nQCL was scanned across CO's P(0,20) and P(1,14) absorption transitions at 1 kHz\nto measure the gas temperature and concentration of CO. Measurements were\nacquired in a gas cell and in an ethylene-air flame at 1 atm. The measured\nspectra were processed using the new m-FID-based method and two traditional\nmethods which rely on inferring the baseline error within the spectral-fitting\nroutine. The m-FID-based method demonstrated superior accuracy in all cases and\na measurement precision that was 1.5 to 10 times smaller than that provided\nusing traditional methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2020 14:29:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-24"}

The\ncorrelation functions and power spectrum are used as a central tool for the\nstudies on the BAO analysis. In this work, we analyzed the spatial distribution\nof galaxies with a method from the topological data analysis (TDA), in order to\ndetect and examine the BAO signal in the galaxy distribution. The TDA provides\na method to treat various types of \"holes\" in point set data, by constructing\nthe persistent homology (PH) group from the geometric structure of data points\nand handling the topological information of the dataset. We can obtain the\ninformation on the size, position, and statistical significance of the holes in\nthe data. A particularly strong point of the persistent homology is that it can\nclassify the holes by their spatial dimension, i.e., a 0-dim separation, 1-dim\nloop, 2-dim shell, etc. We first analyzed the simulation datasets with and\nwithout the baryon physics to examine the performance of the PH method. We\nfound that the PH is indeed able to detect the BAO signal: simulation data with\nbaryon physics present a prominent signal from the BAO, while data without\nbaryon physics does not show this signal. Then, we applied the PH to a quasar\nsample at $z <1.0$ from extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey in\nSloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 14. We discovered a characteristic hole\n(a hollow shell) at a scaler $\\sim150\\ [{\\rm Mpc}]$. This exactly corresponds\nto the BAO signature imprinted in the galaxy/quasar distribution.

We tested the protocol in a\ndirect comparison with reference RT-PCR testing on 448 samples split into\ngroups of 3 sizes for RT-dPCR analysis: 56 groups of 8 samples, 28 groups of 16\nsamples and 14 groups of 32 samples.\n  Results: Individual RT-PCR testing identified 25 positive samples. Using\ngroups of 8, testing by RT-dPCR identified 23 groups as positive, corresponding\nto 26 true positive samples including 2 samples not initially detected by\nindividual RT-PCR but confirmed positive by further RT-PCR and RT-dPCR\ninvestigation. For groups of 16, 15 groups tested positive, corresponding to 25\ntrue positive samples identified. 100% concordance is found for groups of 32\nbut with limited data points.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jun 2020 17:58:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-05"}

Adaptations to drainage\nregimes are one of the most promising options for methane mitigation in rice\nproduction. Whereas several studies have focused on mid-season drainage (MD) to\nmitigate GHG emissions, early-season drainage (ED) varying in timing and\nduration has not been extensively studied. However, such ED periods could\npotentially be very effective since initial available Carbon levels (and\nthereby the potential for methanogenesis) can be very high in paddy systems\nwith rice straw incorporation. This study tested the effectiveness of seven\ndrainage regimes varying in their timing and duration (combinations of ED and\nMD) to mitigate methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in a 101-day\ngrowth chamber experiment. Emissions were considerably reduced by early-season\ndrainage compared to both conventional continuous flooding (CF) and the MD\ndrainage regime. The results suggest that ED + MD drainage may have the\npotential to reduce methane emissions and yield-scaled global warming potential\nby 85 to 90% compared to CF and by 75 to 77% compared to MD only. A combination\nof (short or long) ED drainage and one MD drainage episode was found to be the\nmost effective in mitigating methane emissions without negatively affecting\nyield. In particular, compared with CF, the long early-season drainage\ntreatments LE + SM and LE + LM significantly decreased yield scaled global\nwarming potential by 85% and 87% respectively. This was associated with carbon\nbeing stabilised early in the season, thereby reducing available carbon for\nmethanogenesis. Overall nitrous oxide emissions were small and not\nsignificantly affected by ED.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2020 14:59:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-05"}

We construct and analyze maps of the mean proper motion and its\ndispersion over the region ~30x12 degrees, which show a number of interesting\nfeatures. The intrinsic 3d density distribution (orientation, thickness) is\nstrongly constrained by kinematics; we find that the remnant is a prolate\nstructure with the major axis pointing at 45deg from the orbital velocity and\nextending up to ~5 kpc, where it transitions into the stream.

Further, we show that existing\nlower bounds for the sparse linear bandit problem strongly suggest that our\nregret bounds are unimprovable. To complement our theoretical contributions, we\nalso conduct experiments to demonstrate that our algorithm can greatly\noutperform the performance of the standard linear bandit approach when\n$\\Theta^*$ is low-rank.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2020 15:30:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 17:52:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-20"}

The effect of\ntemperature, pressure and irradiation on the structure of chalcogens is\nreviewed in detail. As only selenium can form a stable glass at ambient\nconditions, the interest on sulfur and tellurium has been placed in the melt\nand the amorphous phase, respectively, whereas reference is also made to the\nsporadic structural studies of glassy sulfur at low temperatures. It is shown\nhow Raman scattering can be exploited to explore unique phenomena emerging in\nthe liquid state of sulfur, offering valuable information on the details of\nlambda transition including various thermodynamic related properties.

A fully ionized deposition flux was used to\nrepresent the high ionization fraction in the HiPIMS process. To mimic\ndifferent substrate bias, we assumed the deposition flux with a flat energy\ndistribution in the low, moderate and high energy ranges. We also compared the\nresults of fully ionized flux with results assuming a completely neutral flux,\nin analogy with thermal evaporation. It is confirmed that in the low energy\nregime, HiPIMS presents a slightly smoother surface and more interface mixing\ncompared to that of thermal evaporation. In the moderate energy HiPIMS,\nhowever, an atomically smooth surface was obtained with a slight increase in\nthe interface mixing compared to low energy HiPIMS. In the high energy regime,\nHiPIMS presents severe interface mixing with a smooth surface but limited\ngrowth due to resputtering from the surface. The results also indicate that\nfewer crystal defects appear in the film for moderate energy HiPIMS. We\nattribute this behavior to the repetition frequency of collision events. In\nparticular high energy HiPIMS suffers from high repetition of collision events\nwhich does not allow reconstruction of the film. While in the low energy HiPIMS\nthere are not enough events to overcome island growth. At moderate energy,\ncollision events repeat in a manner that provides enough time for\nreconstruction which results in a smooth surface, fewer defects and limited\nintermixing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2020 14:54:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-11"}

In a national election, politicians would like to have persuasive\nspeakers campaign on their behalf. When a company faces adverse publicity, they\nwould like to engage persuasive advocates for their position in the presence of\nadversaries who are critical of them. Debates represent a common platform for\nthese forms of adversarial persuasion. This paper solves two problems: the\nDebate Outcome Prediction (DOP) problem predicts who wins a debate while the\nIntensity of Persuasion Prediction (IPP) problem predicts the change in the\nnumber of votes before and after a speaker speaks. Though DOP has been\npreviously studied, we are the first to study IPP. Past studies on DOP fail to\nleverage two important aspects of multimodal data: 1) multiple modalities are\noften semantically aligned, and 2) different modalities may provide diverse\ninformation for prediction. Our M2P2 (Multimodal Persuasion Prediction)\nframework is the first to use multimodal (acoustic, visual, language) data to\nsolve the IPP problem. To leverage the alignment of different modalities while\nmaintaining the diversity of the cues they provide, M2P2 devises a novel\nadaptive fusion learning framework which fuses embeddings obtained from two\nmodules -- an alignment module that extracts shared information between\nmodalities and a heterogeneity module that learns the weights of different\nmodalities with guidance from three separately trained unimodal reference\nmodels. We test M2P2 on the popular IQ2US dataset designed for DOP. We also\nintroduce a new dataset called QPS (from Qipashuo, a popular Chinese debate TV\nshow ) for IPP. M2P2 significantly outperforms 4 recent baselines on both\ndatasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jun 2020 18:47:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 11 Dec 2021 20:50:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-14"}

With new limits\non the Jovian source function (i.e. the particle intensity just outside the\nJovian magnetosphere), and a new set of in-situ observations at 1 AU for both\ncases of good and poor magnetic connection between the source and observer, we\nrevisit some of these earlier simulations. We aim to find the optimal numerical\nset-up that can be used to simulate the propagation of 6 MeV Jovian electrons\nin the inner heliosphere. Using such a set-up, we further aim to study the\nresidence (propagation) times of these particles for different levels of\nmagnetic connection between Jupiter and an observer at Earth (1 AU). Using an\nadvanced Jovian electron propagation model based on the stochastic differential\nequation (SDE) approach, we calculate the Jovian electron intensity for\ndifferent model parameters. A comparison with observations leads to an optimal\nnumerical set-up, which is then used to calculate the so-called residence\n(propagation) times of these particles. Comparing to in-situ observations, we\nare able to derive transport parameters that are appropriate to study the\npropagation of 6 MeV Jovian electrons in the inner heliosphere. Moreover, using\nthese values, we show that the method of calculating the residence time applied\nin former literature is not suited to being interpreted as the propagation time\nof physical particles. This is due to an incorrect weighting of the probability\ndistribution. We propose and apply a new method, where the results from each\npseudo-particle are weighted by its resulting phase-space density (i.e. the\nnumber of physical particles that it represents).
