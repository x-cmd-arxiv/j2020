In our setting, a large population of consumers is drawn from some\ndistribution over risk tolerances, and each consumer must be assigned to a\nportfolio of lower risk than her tolerance. The consumers may also belong to\nunderlying groups (for instance, of demographic properties or wealth), and the\ngoal is to design a small number of portfolios that are fair across groups in a\nparticular and natural technical sense.\n  Our main results are algorithms for optimal and near-optimal portfolio design\nfor both social welfare and fairness objectives, both with and without\nassumptions on the underlying group structure. We describe an efficient\nalgorithm based on an internal two-player zero-sum game that learns\nnear-optimal fair portfolios ex ante and show experimentally that it can be\nused to obtain a small set of fair portfolios ex post as well. For the special\nbut natural case in which group structure coincides with risk tolerances (which\nmodels the reality that wealthy consumers generally tolerate greater risk), we\ngive an efficient and optimal fair algorithm. We also provide generalization\nguarantees for the underlying risk distribution that has no dependence on the\nnumber of portfolios and illustrate the theory with simulation results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2020 16:00:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-15"}

Recently, we identified a remarkable class of such systems and\ntermed them dual-unitary quantum circuits. These are brick-wall type local\nquantum circuits whose dynamics are unitary in both time and space. For these\nsystems the spatio-temporal correlation functions are non-trivial only at the\nedge of the causal light cone and can be computed in terms of one-dimensional\ntransfer matrices. Dual-unitarity, however, requires fine-tuning and the degree\nof generality of the observed dynamical features remained unclear. Here we\naddress this question by introducing arbitrary perturbations of the local\ngates. Considering fixed perturbations, we prove that for a particular class of\nunperturbed elementary dual-unitary gates the correlation functions are still\nexpressed in terms of one-dimensional transfer matrices. These matrices,\nhowever, are now contracted over generic paths connecting the origin to a fixed\nendpoint inside the causal light cone. The correlation function is given as a\nsum over all such paths. Our statement is rigorous in the \"dilute limit\", where\nonly a small fraction of the gates is perturbed, and in the presence of random\nlongitudinal fields, but we provide theoretical arguments and stringent\nnumerical checks supporting its validity even in the clean case and when all\ngates are perturbed. As a byproduct, in the case of random longitudinal fields\n-- which turns out to be equivalent to certain classical Markov chains -- we\nfind four types of non-dual-unitary(and non-integrable) interacting many-body\nsystems where the correlation functions are exactly given by the path-sum\nformula.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2020 16:36:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Oct 2020 15:07:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-11"}

Asymptotic giant branch stars are cool luminous evolved stars that\nare well observable across the Galaxy and populating Gaia data. They have\ncomplex stellar surface dynamics Aims.

We observed this star with the MIRC-X beam\ncombiner installed at the CHARA interferometer to detect the presence of\nstellar surface inhomogeneities. Methods. We performed the reconstruction of\naperture synthesis images from the interferometric observations at different\nwavelengths. Then, we used 3D radiative hydrodynamics simulations of stellar\nconvection with CO5BOLD and the post-processing radiative transfer code Optim3D\nto compute intensity maps in the spectral channels of MIRC-X observations.\nThen, we determined the stellar radius and compared the 3D synthetic maps to\nthe reconstructed ones focusing on matching the intensity contrast, the\nmorphology of stellar surface structures, and the photocentre position at two\ndifferent spectral channels, 1.52 and 1.70 micron, simultaneously. Results. We\nmeasured the apparent diameter of CL Lac at two wavelengths and recovered the\nradius using a Gaia parallax. In addition to this, the reconstructed images are\ncharacterised by the presence of a brighter area that largely affects the\nposition of the photocentre. The comparison with 3D simulation shows good\nagreement with the observations both in terms of contrast and surface structure\nmorphology, meaning that our model is adequate for explaining the observed\ninhomogenities.

Recent work\nuses a standard tracking-by-detection pipeline, where feature extraction is\nfirst performed independently for each object in order to compute an affinity\nmatrix.

A key process of this standard pipeline is to learn discriminative\nfeatures for different objects in order to reduce confusion during data\nassociation. In this work, we propose two techniques to improve the\ndiscriminative feature learning for MOT: (1) instead of obtaining features for\neach object independently, we propose a novel feature interaction mechanism by\nintroducing the Graph Neural Network. As a result, the feature of one object is\ninformed of the features of other objects so that the object feature can lean\ntowards the object with similar feature (i.e., object probably with a same ID)\nand deviate from objects with dissimilar features (i.e., object probably with\ndifferent IDs), leading to a more discriminative feature for each object; (2)\ninstead of obtaining the feature from either 2D or 3D space in prior work, we\npropose a novel joint feature extractor to learn appearance and motion features\nfrom 2D and 3D space simultaneously. As features from different modalities\noften have complementary information, the joint feature can be more\ndiscriminate than feature from each individual modality. To ensure that the\njoint feature extractor does not heavily rely on one modality, we also propose\nan ensemble training paradigm.

Most\nGCN methods are either restricted to graphs with a homogeneous type of edges\n(e.g., citation links only), or focusing on representation learning for nodes\nonly instead of jointly propagating and updating the embeddings of both nodes\nand edges for target-driven objectives. This paper addresses these limitations\nby proposing a novel framework, namely the Knowledge Embedding based Graph\nConvolutional Network (KE-GCN), which combines the power of GCNs in graph-based\nbelief propagation and the strengths of advanced knowledge embedding (a.k.a.\nknowledge graph embedding) methods, and goes beyond. Our theoretical analysis\nshows that KE-GCN offers an elegant unification of several well-known GCN\nmethods as specific cases, with a new perspective of graph convolution.\nExperimental results on benchmark datasets show the advantageous performance of\nKE-GCN over strong baseline methods in the tasks of knowledge graph alignment\nand entity classification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2020 17:12:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Apr 2021 15:54:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-26"}

Each of these scenarios presents specific requirements\nand demands different network configurations. To deal with this heterogeneity,\nvirtualization technology is key technology. Indeed, the network function\nvirtualization (NFV) paradigm provides flexibility for the network manager,\nallocating resources according to the demand, and reduces acquisition and\noperational costs. In addition, it is possible to specify an ordered set of\nnetwork virtual functions (VNFs) for a given service, which is called as\nservice function chain (SFC).

To this extent,\nlinear stability analyses of two-dimensional models are proposed: the standard\nBhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) collision model, the original pre-collision\nregularization and the recursive regularized model, where off-equilibrium\ndistributions are partially computed thanks to a recursive formula. A\nsystematic identification of the physical content carried by each LB mode is\ndone by analyzing the eigenvectors of the linear systems. Stability results are\nthen numerically confirmed by performing simulations of shear and acoustic\nwaves. This work allows drawing fair conclusions on the stability properties of\neach model. In particular, recursive regularization turns out to be the most\nstable model for the D2Q9 lattice, especially in the zero-viscosity limit. Two\nmajor properties shared by every regularized model are highlighted: (1) a mode\nfiltering property, and (2) an incorrect, and broadly anisotropic, dissipation\nrate of the modes carrying physical waves in under-resolved conditions. The\nfirst property is the main source of increased stability, especially for the\nrecursive regularization. It is a direct consequence of the reconstruction of\noff-equilibrium populations before each collision process, decreasing the rank\nof the system of discrete equations. The second property seems to be related to\nnumerical errors directly induced by the equilibration of high-order moments.\nIn such a case, this property is likely to occur with any collision model that\nfollows such a stabilization methodology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2020 17:43:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-18"}

In particular, the convergence power spectrum of subhalos within\nlensing galaxies has been suggested as a promising observable to study DM.\nHowever, the distances involved in strong-lensing systems are vast, and we\nexpect the relevant volume to contain line-of-sight (LOS) halos that are not\nassociated with the main lens. We develop a formalism to calculate the effect\nof LOS halos as an effective convergence power spectrum. The multi-lens plane\nequation couples the angular deflections of consecutive lens planes, but by\nassuming that the perturbations due to the LOS halos are small, we show that\nthey can be projected onto the main-lens plane as effective subhalos. We test\nour formalism by simulating lensing systems using the full multi-plane lens\nequation and find excellent agreement. We show how the relative contribution of\nLOS halos and subhalos depends on the source and lens redshift, as well as the\nassumed halo and subhalo mass functions. For a fiducial system with fraction of\nDM halo mass in substructure $f_{\\rm sub}=0.4\\%$ for subhalo masses\n$[10^5-10^8]\\rm{M}_{\\odot}$, the interloper contribution to the power spectrum\nis at least several times greater than that of subhalos for source redshifts\n$z_s\\gtrsim0.5$. Furthermore, it is likely that for the SLACS and BELLS lenses\nthe interloper contribution dominates: $f_{\\rm sub}\\gtrsim2\\%$ ($4\\%$) is\nneeded for subhalos to dominate in SLACS (BELLS), which is higher than current\nupper bounds on $f_{\\rm sub}$ for our mass range. Since the halo mass function\nis better understood from first principles, the dominance of interlopers in\ngalaxy-galaxy lenses with high-quality imaging can be seen as a significant\nadvantage when translating this observable into a constraint on DM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2020 18:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2020 14:30:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 23 Sep 2020 21:39:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-25"}

By analyzing a large dataset, we find that N-substitution\n((N)$_\\textrm{O}$) prefers to reside at highly coordinated oxygen site to\nmaximize its coordination, whereas N-interstitial ((NO)$_\\textrm{O}$) and\nsplit-interstitial ((N$_2)_\\textrm{O}$) favor the dangling oxygen site.\nInterestingly, we notice that each types of defect (viz. substitution,\ninterstitials) reduce the fundamental gap and excitation energy substantially.\nHowever, (NO)$_\\textrm{O}$ and (N$_2)_\\textrm{O}$ doped clusters are the\npotential candidates for overall water splitting, whereas N$_\\textrm{O}$ is\ncongenial only for oxygen evolution reaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2020 18:11:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-26"}

We present a step-by-step observational strategy for using oxygen as\na robust biosignature, to prioritize exoplanet targets and design future\nobservations. It is premised on avoiding planets lacking subaerial weathering\nof continents, which would imply geochemical cycles drastically different from\nEarth$'$s, precluding use of oxygen as a biosignature. The strategy starts with\nthe most readily obtained data: semi-major axis and stellar luminosity to\nensure residence in the habitable zone; stellar XUV flux, to ensure an\nexoplanet can retain a secondary (outgassed) atmosphere. Next, high-precision\nmass and radius information should be combined with high-precision stellar\nabundance data, to constrain the exoplanet$'$s water content; those\nincompatible with less than 0.1 wt % H$_{2}$O can be deprioritized. Then,\nreflectance photometry or low-resolution transmission spectroscopy should\nconfirm an optically thin atmosphere. Subsequent long-duration, high-resolution\ntransmission spectroscopy should search for oxygen and ensure that water vapor\nand CO$_{2}$ are present only at low (10$^{2}$-10$^{4}$ ppm levels).

An implausible change to software is something\nthat has never been changed in prior releases. When planning how to reduce\ndefects, it is better to use plausible changes, i.e., changes with some\nprecedence in the prior releases.\n  To demonstrate these points, this paper compares several defect reduction\nplanning tools. LIME is a local sensitivity analysis tool that can report the\nfewest changes needed to alter the classification of some code module (e.g.,\nfrom \"defective\" to \"non-defective\"). TimeLIME is a new tool, introduced in\nthis paper, that improves LIME by restricting its plans to just those\nattributes which change the most within a project.\n  In this study, we compared the performance of LIME and TimeLIME and several\nother defect reduction planning algorithms.

The observed frequency detuning and the calculated damping\nrates of the daughter modes favor the equilibrium-state interpretation.

Various detection techniques for Deepfake attacks have\nbeen explored. These methods, however, are passive measures against Deepfakes\nas they are mitigation strategies after the high-quality fake content is\ngenerated. More importantly, we would like to think ahead of the attackers with\nrobust defenses. This work aims to take an offensive measure to impede the\ngeneration of high-quality fake images or videos. Specifically, we propose to\nuse novel transformation-aware adversarially perturbed faces as a defense\nagainst GAN-based Deepfake attacks. Different from the naive adversarial faces,\nour proposed approach leverages differentiable random image transformations\nduring the generation. We also propose to use an ensemble-based approach to\nenhance the defense robustness against GAN-based Deepfake variants under the\nblack-box setting. We show that training a Deepfake model with adversarial\nfaces can lead to a significant degradation in the quality of synthesized\nfaces. This degradation is twofold. On the one hand, the quality of the\nsynthesized faces is reduced with more visual artifacts such that the\nsynthesized faces are more obviously fake or less convincing to human\nobservers. On the other hand, the synthesized faces can easily be detected\nbased on various metrics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2020 18:51:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-16"}

We demonstrate the validity of the approach on\nseveral synthetic datasets, as well as on calcium recordings from the ellipsoid\nbody of Drosophila melanogaster and extracellular recordings from the mouse\nanterodorsal thalamic nucleus. These circuits are both known to encode head\ndirection, and mGPLVM correctly recovers the ring topology expected from neural\npopulations representing a single angular variable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2020 19:08:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 2020 15:06:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-22"}

However, there is\ngrowing theoretical and observational evidence that such mixing is present and\ncan affect various aspects of a star's life. In this work, we present a first\nattempt at quantifying mixing by horizontal shear instabilities in stars using\nDirect Numerical Simulations. The shear is driven by a body force, and rapidly\nbecomes unstable. At saturation, we find that several distinct dynamical\nregimes exist, depending on the relative importance of stratification and\nthermal diffusion (viscosity can in principle also matter, but is usually\nnegligible in most stellar applications). In each of the regimes identified, we\nput forward a certain number of theoretically motivated scaling laws for the\nturbulent vertical eddy scale, the typical turbulent diffusion coefficient, and\nthe typical amplitude of temperature fluctuations (among other quantities).\nBased on our findings, we predict that the majority of stars should fall into\none of two categories: high P\\'eclet number stratified turbulence, and low\nP\\'eclet number stratified turbulence. The latter is presented in detail in a\nrelated paper by Cope et al. (2020), while the former is discussed here.\nApplying our results to the best-known stellar shear layer, namely the solar\ntachocline, we find that it should lie in the high P\\'eclet number stratified\nturbulence regime, and predict a substantial amount of vertical mixing for\ntemperature, momentum and composition. Taken as is, the new turbulence model\npredictions are incompatible with the Spiegel & Zahn (1992) model of the solar\ntachocline. However, we also show that rotation and magnetic fields are likely\nto affect the turbulence, and need to be taken into account in future studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2020 19:30:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-07"}

Instead of\nadding the residuals for all parameter values to the subspace we create a\nlow-rank approximation of the matrix consisting of these residuals and add only\nthe column space to the subspace.

A desirable property of a tree packing, that\nis both sufficient and necessary for leveraging the high connectivity of a\ngraph in distributed communication, is that its diameter is low. Yet, despite\nextensive research in this area, it is still unclear how to compute a tree\npacking, whose diameter is sublinear in $|V(G)|$, in a low-diameter graph $G$,\nor alternatively how to show that such a packing does not exist.\n  In this paper we provide first non-trivial upper and lower bounds on the\ndiameter of tree packing.

In this paper, by jointly considering\nthe features of live videos and edge servers, we propose PLVER, a proactive\nlive video push scheme to resolve the cache miss problem in live video\ndelivery. Specifically, PLVER first conducts a one-tomultiple stable allocation\nbetween edge clusters and user groups, to balance the load of live traffic over\nthe edge servers. Then it adopts proactive video replication algorithms to\nspeed up the video replication among the edge servers. We conduct extensive\ntrace-driven evaluations, covering 0.3 million Twitch viewers and more than 300\nTwitch channels. The results demonstrate that with PLVER, edge servers can\ncarry 28% and 82% more traffic than the auction-based replication method and\nthe caching on requested time method, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2020 23:04:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-16"}

We identify a\npersisting dilemma on the value of labels in the context of imbalanced\nlearning: on the one hand, supervision from labels typically leads to better\nresults than its unsupervised counterparts; on the other hand, heavily\nimbalanced data naturally incurs \"label bias\" in the classifier, where the\ndecision boundary can be drastically altered by the majority classes. In this\nwork, we systematically investigate these two facets of labels. We demonstrate,\ntheoretically and empirically, that class-imbalanced learning can significantly\nbenefit in both semi-supervised and self-supervised manners. Specifically, we\nconfirm that (1) positively, imbalanced labels are valuable: given more\nunlabeled data, the original labels can be leveraged with the extra data to\nreduce label bias in a semi-supervised manner, which greatly improves the final\nclassifier; (2) negatively however, we argue that imbalanced labels are not\nuseful always: classifiers that are first pre-trained in a self-supervised\nmanner consistently outperform their corresponding baselines. Extensive\nexperiments on large-scale imbalanced datasets verify our theoretically\ngrounded strategies, showing superior performance over previous\nstate-of-the-arts.

In this work,\nwe show that when the sequence of loss functions is predictable, a simple\nmodification of FTPL which incorporates optimism can achieve better regret\nguarantees, while retaining the optimal worst-case regret guarantee for\nunpredictable sequences. A key challenge in obtaining these tighter regret\nbounds is the stochasticity and optimism in the algorithm, which requires\ndifferent analysis techniques than those commonly used in the analysis of FTPL.\nThe key ingredient we utilize in our analysis is the dual view of perturbation\nas regularization.

From the analysis\nof the dilatometry curves and extensive microstructure characterization, it was\nfound that till the 2nd cycle of re-austenitization, both PAG size and\nmartensite start (Ms) temperature get reduced, while the amount of bainite\ntransformed decreased and the retained austenite content increased.\nConcomitantly, the highest microhardness along with peak nanohardness of the\nconstituent phases was achieved at the 2nd cycle. Conversely, from the 3rd\ncycle, the microhardness, as well as the nanohardness of the constituent\nphases, are found to decrease due to an increase in the PAG size. This behavior\nis in contrast to the general tendency where a saturation limit is reached\nafter the peak refinement is achieved. It is found that retained austenite can\nact as a pinning particle to obstruct the PAG boundary movement and its\nfraction is found to decrease from the 3rd cycle.

Within the context of\nPMN, we review stimulating research problems and potential solutions, organized\nunder nine topics: performance bounds, waveform optimization, antenna array\ndesign, clutter suppression, sensing parameter estimation, resolution of\nsensing ambiguity, pattern analysis, networked sensing under cellular topology,\nand sensing-assisted communications. We conclude the paper by listing key open\nresearch problems for the aforementioned topics and sharing some lessons that\nwe have learned.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Jun 2020 04:36:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Sep 2020 23:28:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 16 Jan 2021 08:52:53 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 21 Oct 2021 02:44:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-22"}

We compile multi-wavelength\ndata out to 500 $\\mu$m and use it for Spectral Energy Distribution (SED)\nfitting with CIGALE to investigate the physical properties of AKARI galaxies\nwithout optical counterparts. We also compare their physical quantities with\nAKARI mid-IR selected galaxies with HSC counterparts. The estimated redshifts\nof AKARI objects without HSC counterparts range up to $z\\sim 4$, significantly\nhigher than that of AKARI objects with HSC counterparts. We find that: (i) 3.6\n$-$ 4.5 $\\mu$m color, (ii) AGN luminosity, (iii) stellar mass, (iv) star\nformation rate, and (v) $V$-band dust attenuation in the interstellar medium of\nAKARI objects without HSC counterparts are systematically larger than those of\nAKARI objects with counterparts. These results suggest that our sample includes\nluminous, heavily dust-obscured SFGs/AGNs at $z\\sim 1-4$ that are missed by\nprevious optical surveys, providing very interesting targets for the coming\nJames Webb Space Telescope era.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Jun 2020 06:46:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-19"}

In space, these methods highly diverge and apply\ndifferent fourth-order accurate differentiation techniques. The first method\nuses compact finite differences (CFD) on nodal meshes that requires solving\ntridiagonal linear systems along each grid line, while the second one employs\nstaggered-grid mimetic finite differences (MFD).

We note that our algorithm for MIS is deterministic while\nfor MM we use randomization which we prove is unavoidable: any deterministic\nalgorithm for MM requires $\\Omega(n^2)$ time even for $\\beta(G) = 2$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Jun 2020 12:12:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-16"}

SC issues are\ndifficult for developers to diagnose in practice, since understanding them\ntypically requires domain knowledge. Although adapting the existing test\ngeneration technique for dependency conflict issues, Riddle, to detect SC\nissues is feasible, its effectiveness is greatly compromised.

Typically this debris is assumed to be in\nthe form of a (circular) disc, and to originate from asteroids that passed\nclose enough to the white dwarf to be pulled apart by tides. However,\ntheoretical considerations suggest that the circularisation of the debris,\nwhich initially occupies highly eccentric orbits, is very slow. We therefore\nhypothesise that the observations may be readily explained by the debris\nremaining on highly eccentric orbits, and we explore the properties of such\ndebris. For the generic case of an asteroid originating at several au from the\nwhite dwarf, we find that all of the tidal debris is always bound to the white\ndwarf and that the orbital energy distribution of the debris is narrow enough\nthat it executes similar elliptical orbits with only a narrow spread. Assuming\nthat the tidal field of the white dwarf is sufficient to minimise the effects\nof self-gravity and collisions within the debris, we estimate the time over\nwhich the debris spreads into a single elliptical ring, and we generate toy\nspectra and lightcurves from the initial disruption to late times when the\ndebris distribution is essentially time steady.

The most common approach to this issue is debiasing, for\nexample via the introduction of quotas that ensure proportional representation\nof groups with respect to a certain, often binary attribute.

Estimating stellar mass, especially\nin the red giant regime, is difficult. In particular, stellar masses of a\nsample of evolved planet-hosting stars based on spectroscopy and grid-based\nmodelling have been put to question over the past decade with claims they were\noverestimated. Although efforts have been made in the past to reconcile this\ndispute using asteroseismology, results were inconclusive. In an attempt to\nresolve this controversy, we study four more evolved planet-hosting stars in\nthis paper using asteroseismology, and we revisit previous results to make an\ninformed study of the whole ensemble in a self-consistent way. For the four new\nstars, we measure their masses by locating their characteristic oscillation\nfrequency, $\\mathrm{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{max}}$, from their radial velocity time\nseries observed by SONG. For two stars, we are also able to measure the large\nfrequency separation, $\\mathrm{\\Delta\\nu}$, helped by extended SONG single-site\nand dual-site observations and new TESS observations. We establish the\nrobustness of the $\\mathrm{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{max}}$-only-based results by\ndetermining the stellar mass from $\\mathrm{\\Delta\\nu}$, and from both\n$\\mathrm{\\Delta\\nu}$ and $\\mathrm{\\nu}_{\\mathrm{max}}$. We then compare the\nseismic masses of the full ensemble of 16 stars with the spectroscopic masses\nfrom three different literature sources. We find an offset between the seismic\nand spectroscopic mass scales that is mass-dependent, suggesting that the\npreviously claimed overestimation of spectroscopic masses only affects stars\nmore massive than about 1.6 M$_\\mathrm{\\odot}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 13 Jun 2020 14:35:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Jun 2020 15:06:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2020 12:22:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-30"}

In both cities, we take the spatial orientation of historic churches as\ngood indicators of the original layout of the respective urban lattices.\nAlthough we find a clear orientation pattern for La Laguna, which singles out\nan absolute-value astronomical declination slightly below 20 degrees, pointing\nto a preferred date close to the July 25th feast-day of San Cristobal de Licia,\nin the case of Santa Cruz this trend is not followed. On the contrary, the\npattern we find for Santa Cruz, within the uncertainties due to the low\nstatistics, and apart from one equinoctial and one solstitial oriented\nchurches, is consistent with an orographic orientation within the canonic\nlimits of sunrise. This result highlights the uniqueness of the city of La\nLaguna, and supports the idea suggesting its deliberate planning in the early\n16th century.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2020 18:19:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-17"}

To address these\nchallenges, we propose a parallel reverse attention network (PraNet) for\naccurate polyp segmentation in colonoscopy images.
