Accelerating nonlinear mapping will\ndirectly speed up online systems. Previously the authors of this paper proposed\na Dendrite Net (DD) with enormously lower time complexity than the existing\nnonlinear mapping algorithms; however, there still are redundant calculations\nin DD. This paper presents a DD with an acceleration module (AC) to accelerate\nnonlinear mapping further. We conduct three experiments to verify whether DD\nwith AC has lower time complexity while retaining DD's nonlinear mapping\nproperties and system identification properties: The first experiment is the\nprecision and identification of unary nonlinear mapping, reflecting the\ncalculation performance using DD with AC for basic functions in online systems.\nThe second experiment is the mapping precision and identification of the\nmulti-input nonlinear system, reflecting the performance for designing online\nsystems via DD with AC. Finally, this paper compares the time complexity of DD\nand DD with AC and analyzes the theoretical reasons through repeated\nexperiments. Results: DD with AC retains DD's excellent mapping and\nidentification properties and has lower time complexity. Significance: DD with\nAC can be used for most engineering systems, such as sensor systems, and will\nspeed up computation in these online systems.

Matching\nneighborhood-level predicted storm surge heights with mortgage files suggests\nthat coastal flood risk may be large: originations and securitizations in storm\nsurge areas have been rising sharply since 2012, while they remain stable when\nusing flood insurance maps. Every year, more than 50 billion dollars of\noriginations occur in storm surge areas outside of insurance floodplains. The\nshare of agency mortgages increases in storm surge areas, yet remains stable in\nthe flood insurance 100-year floodplain.

This work\nstudies the turbulent energy transfer in the NIW--quasigeostrophic mean\nmesoscale eddy coupled system based on a previously derived two-dimensional\nmodel which has a Hamiltonian structure and inherits conserved quantities in\nthe Boussinesq equations (Xie \\& Vanneste, \\textit{J.

When $0<R<R_c$, energy transfers bidirectionally, wave\naction transfers downscale, and vorticity form strong cyclones. While when\n$R>R_c$, energy transfers downscale, wave action transfers bidirectionally, and\nvortex filaments are dominant. We find the catalytic wave induction (CWI)\nmechanism where the NIW induces a downscale energy flux of the mean flow.

By trading off hand contacts for\nenvironmental contacts, a shared grasp requires fewer contacts with the hand,\nand enables manipulation even when a full grasp is not possible. Previous\nresearch has used shared grasps for non-prehensile manipulation such as\npivoting and tumbling. This paper treats the problem more generally, with\nmethods to select the best shared grasp and robot actions for a desired object\nmotion. The central issue is to evaluate the feasible contact modes: for each\ncontact, whether that contact will remain active, and whether slip will occur.\nRobustness is important. When a contact mode fails, e.g., when a contact is\nlost, or when unintentional slip occurs, the operation will fail, and in some\ncases damage may occur. In this work, we enumerate all feasible contact modes,\ncalculate corresponding controls, and select the most robust candidate. We can\nalso optimize the contact geometry for robustness. This paper employs\nquasi-static analysis of planar rigid bodies with Coulomb friction to derive\nthe algorithms and controls. Finally, we demonstrate the robustness of shared\ngrasping and the use of our methods in representative experiments and examples.\nThe video can be found at https://youtu.be/tyNhJvRYZNk\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2020 16:30:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-05"}

Yet, a common problem in emotion recognition systems lies in the\nscarcity of reliable labels. By modeling pairwise differences between samples\nof interest, a Siamese network can help to mitigate this challenge since it\nrequires fewer samples than traditional deep learning methods. In this paper,\nwe propose a distance loss, which can be applied on the Siamese network\nfine-tuning, by optimizing the model based on the relevant distance between\nsame and difference class pairs. Our system use samples from the source data to\npre-train the weights of proposed Siamese neural network, which are fine-tuned\nbased on the target data.

We combined\nhigh-precision time-series photometry from the NASA Transiting Exoplanet Survey\nSatellite with high-resolution ground-based spectroscopy of 70 stars with\nspectral types O and B to probe the relationship between the photometric\nsignatures of IGWs and parameters such as spectroscopic mass, luminosity, and\nmacroturbulence.

This elusive, mesoscopic level of\norganisation is often sought for via factor models that ultimately decompose\nthe market according to geographic regions and economic industries. However, at\na more general level the presence of mesoscopic structure might be revealed in\nan entirely data-driven approach, looking for a modular and possibly\nhierarchical organisation of the empirical correlation matrix between financial\ntime series. The crucial ingredient in such an approach is the definition of an\nappropriate null model for the correlation matrix. Recent research showed that\ncommunity detection techniques developed for networks become intrinsically\nbiased when applied to correlation matrices. For this reason, a method based on\nRandom Matrix Theory has been developed, which identifies the optimal\nhierarchical decomposition of the system into internally correlated and\nmutually anti-correlated communities. Building upon this technique, here we\nresolve the mesoscopic structure of the CDS market and identify groups of\nissuers that cannot be traced back to standard industry/region taxonomies,\nthereby being inaccessible to standard factor models. We use this decomposition\nto introduce a novel default risk model that is shown to outperform more\ntraditional alternatives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2020 17:02:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Apr 2021 12:18:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-30"}

The idea of self-organized criticality\n(SOC), introduced back in 1987 by Bak, Tang and Wiesenfeld suggests that, under\ncertain circumstances, natural systems can seemingly self-tune to a critical\nstate with its concomitant power-laws and scaling. Theoretical progress allowed\nfor a rationalization of how SOC works by relating its critical properties to\nthose of a standard non-equilibrium second-order phase transition that\nseparates an active state in which dynamical activity reverberates\nindefinitely, from an absorbing or quiescent state where activity eventually\nceases. Here, we briefly review these ideas as well as a recent closely-related\nconcept: self-organized bistability (SOB). In SOB, the very same type of\nfeedback operates in a system characterized by a discontinuos phase transition,\nwhich has no critical point but instead presents bistability between active and\nquiescent states. SOB also leads to scale-invariant avalanches of activity but,\nin this case, with a different type of scaling and coexisting with anomalously\nlarge outbursts. Moreover, SOB explains experiments with real sandpiles more\nclosely than SOC. We review similarities and differences between SOC and SOB by\npresenting and analyzing them under a common theoretical framework, covering\nrecent results as well as possible future developments. We also discuss other\nrelated concepts for \"imperfect\" self-organization such as \"self-organized\nquasi-criticality\" and \"self-organized collective oscillations\", of relevance\nin e.g. neuroscience, with the aim of providing an overview of feedback\nmechanisms for self-organization to the edge of a phase transition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2020 17:13:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-28"}

The\nlatter encode the refined BPS spectrum of the SCFTs, which determines geometric\ninvariants of the associated elliptic non-compact Calabi-Yau threefolds. In\nthis paper we establish for all 6d $(1,0)$ SCFTs in the atomic classification\nblowup equations that fix these elliptic genera to large extent. The latter\nfall into two types: the unity- and the vanishing blowup equations. For almost\nall rank one theories, we find unity blowup equations which determine the\nelliptic genera completely. We develop several techniques to compute elliptic\ngenera and BPS invariants from the blowup equations, including a recursion\nformula with respect to the number of strings, a Weyl orbit expansion, a\nrefined BPS expansion and an $\\epsilon_1,\\epsilon_2$ expansion. For higher-rank\ntheories, we propose a gluing rule to obtain all their blowup equations based\non those of rank one theories. For example, we explicitly give the elliptic\nblowup equations for the three higher-rank non-Higgsable clusters, ADE chain of\n$-2$ curves and conformal matter theories. We also give the toric construction\nfor many elliptic non-compact Calabi-Yau threefolds which engineer 6d $(1,0)$\nSCFTs with various matter representations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2020 17:33:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 May 2021 21:21:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 9 Jun 2021 21:07:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-01"}

The first one is a hybrid quantum\nalgorithm that, given an efficiently preparable state, computes expectation\nvalues in a finite energy interval around its mean energy. This algorithm is\nbased on a filtering operator, similar to quantum phase estimation, which\nprojects out energies outside the desired energy interval. However, instead of\nperforming this operation on a physical state, it recovers the physical values\nby performing interferometric measurements without the need to prepare the\nfiltered state. We show that the computational time scales polynomially with\nthe number of qubits, the inverse of the prescribed variance, and the inverse\nerror. In practice, the algorithm does not require the evolution for long\ntimes, but instead a significant number of measurements in order to obtain\nsensible results. Our second algorithm is a quantum-assisted Monte Carlo\nsampling method to compute other quantities which approach the expectation\nvalues for the microcanonical and canonical ensembles. Using classical Monte\nCarlo techniques and the quantum computer as a resource, this method\ncircumvents the sign problem that is plaguing classical Quantum Monte Carlo\nsimulations, as long as one can prepare states with suitable energies.

Light-front (LF) quantum mechanics is employed to factorize\nnuclear and nucleonic structure in the DIS process. A 4-dimensional\nrepresentation of LF spin structure is used to construct the polarized deuteron\nLF wave function and efficiently evaluate the spin sums.

Symmetric private\ninformation retrieval (SPIR) is a variant where a user is able to privately\nretrieve one out of $K$ messages from $N$ non-colluding replicated databases\nwithout learning anything about the remaining $K-1$ messages. However, the goal\nof perfect privacy can be too taxing for certain applications. In this paper,\nwe investigate if the information-theoretic capacity of SPIR (equivalently, the\ninverse of the minimum download cost) can be increased by relaxing both user\nand DB privacy definitions. Such relaxation is relevant in applications where\nprivacy can be traded for communication efficiency. We introduce and\ninvestigate the Asymmetric Leaky PIR (AL-PIR) model with different privacy\nleakage budgets in each direction. For user privacy leakage, we bound the\nprobability ratios between all possible realizations of DB queries by a\nfunction of a non-negative constant $\\epsilon$. For DB privacy, we bound the\nmutual information between the undesired messages, the queries, and the\nanswers, by a function of a non-negative constant $\\delta$. We propose a\ngeneral AL-PIR scheme that achieves an upper bound on the optimal download cost\nfor arbitrary $\\epsilon$ and $\\delta$. We show that the optimal download cost\nof AL-PIR is upper-bounded as $D^{*}(\\epsilon,\\delta)\\leq\n1+\\frac{1}{N-1}-\\frac{\\delta e^{\\epsilon}}{N^{K-1}-1}$. Second, we obtain an\ninformation-theoretic lower bound on the download cost as\n$D^{*}(\\epsilon,\\delta)\\geq\n1+\\frac{1}{Ne^{\\epsilon}-1}-\\frac{\\delta}{(Ne^{\\epsilon})^{K-1}-1}$. The gap\nanalysis between the two bounds shows that our AL-PIR scheme is optimal when\n$\\epsilon =0$, i.e., under perfect user privacy and it is optimal within a\nmaximum multiplicative gap of $\\frac{N-e^{-\\epsilon}}{N-1}$ for any\n$(\\epsilon,\\delta)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2020 17:58:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-05"}

Motivated by previous isotropic turbulent simulations, we carry out\nchemodynamical simulations of stratified media in a Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW)\ngravitational potential with a total mass of $10^{12}$ solar masses and\nturbulence that decreases radially. The simulations assume a metallicity of 0.3\nsolar, a redshift zero metagalatic UV background, and they track ionizations,\nrecombinations, and species-by-species radiative cooling using the MAIHEM\npackage. We compare a suite of ionic column densities with the COS-Halos sample\nof low-redshift star-forming galaxies. Turbulence with an average\none-dimensional velocity dispersion approximately 40 km/s, corresponding to an\nenergy injection rate of approximately $10^{49}$ erg/yr, produces a CGM that\nmatches many of the observed ionic column densities and ratios. In this\nsimulation, the NVI to OVI ratio is suppressed from its equilibrium value due\nto a combination of radiative cooling and cooling from turbulent mixing. This\nlevel of turbulence is consistent with expectations from observations of better\nconstrained, higher-mass systems, and could be sustained by energy input from\nsupernovae, gas inflows, and dynamical friction from dark matter subhalos.

Current schemes\ntypically require measurement devices for tomography that are a priori\ncalibrated to a high precision. Ironically, the accuracy of the measurement\ncalibration is fundamentally limited by the accuracy of state preparation,\nestablishing a vicious cycle. Here, we prove that this cycle can be broken and\nthe fundamental dependence on the measurement devices significantly relaxed. We\nshow that exploiting the natural low-rank structure of quantum states of\ninterest suffices to arrive at a highly scalable blind tomography scheme with a\nclassically efficient post-processing algorithm. We further improve the\nefficiency of our scheme by making use of the sparse structure of the\ncalibrations.

Building on\ntechniques from model-based compressed sensing, we prove that the proposed\nalgorithm recovers a low-rank quantum state and the calibration provided that\nthe measurement model exhibits a restricted isometry property. For generic\nmeasurements, we show that our algorithm requires a close-to-optimal number\nmeasurement settings for solving the blind tomography task. Complementing these\nconceptual and mathematical insights, we numerically demonstrate that blind\nquantum tomography is possible by exploiting low-rank assumptions in a\npractical setting inspired by an implementation of trapped ions using\nconstrained alternating optimization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2020 18:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-08"}

FastMap-D learns a potential function to define\nthe potential field using a machine learning module. In experiments on various\nkinds of directed graphs, we demonstrate the advantage of FastMap-D over other\napproaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2020 19:50:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-08"}

In contrast to the other dwarf planets, its\nsize, shape, albedo, and density are not well constrained. Here we report\nresults of a multi-chord stellar occultation, observed on 2017 January 21.\nSecondary events observed around the main body are consistent with the presence\nof a ring of opacity 0.5, width 70 km, and radius 2,287$_{-45}^{+75}$ km. The\nCentaur Chariklo was the first body other than a giant planet to show a ring\nsystem and the Centaur Chiron was later found to possess something similar to\nChariklo's rings. Haumea is the first body outside the Centaur population with\na ring. The ring is coplanar with both Haumea's equator and the orbit of its\nsatellite Hi'iaka. Its radius places close to the 3:1 mean motion resonance\nwith Haumea's spin period. The occultation by the main body provides an\ninstantaneous elliptical limb with axes 1,704 $\\pm$ 4 km x 1,138 $\\pm$ 26 km.\nCombined with rotational light-curves, it constrains Haumea's 3D orientation\nand its triaxial shape, which is inconsistent with a homogeneous body in\nhydrostatic equilibrium. Haumea's largest axis is at least 2,322 $\\pm$ 60 km,\nlarger than thought before. This implies an upper limit of 1,885 $\\pm$ 80 kg\nm$^{-3}$ for Haumea's density, smaller and less puzzling than previous\nestimations, and a geometric albedo of 0.51 $\\pm$ 0.02, also smaller than\nprevious estimations.

In this paper, we introduce\nthe problem of controlling unknown (discrete-time) MJLS as a new benchmark for\npolicy-based reinforcement learning of Markov decision processes (MDPs) with\nmixed continuous/discrete state variables. Compared with the traditional linear\nquadratic regulator (LQR), our proposed problem leads to a special hybrid MDP\n(with mixed continuous and discrete variables) and poses significant new\nchallenges due to the appearance of an underlying Markov jump parameter\ngoverning the mode of the system dynamics. Specifically, the state of a MJLS\ndoes not form a Markov chain and hence one cannot study the MJLS control\nproblem as a MDP with solely continuous state variable. However, one can\naugment the state and the jump parameter to obtain a MDP with a mixed\ncontinuous/discrete state space. We discuss how control theory sheds light on\nthe policy parameterization of such hybrid MDPs. Then we modify the widely used\nnatural policy gradient method to directly learn the optimal state feedback\ncontrol policy for MJLS without identifying either the system dynamics or the\ntransition probability of the switching parameter. We implement the\n(data-driven) natural policy gradient method on different MJLS examples.

Characteristic\nparameters governing the transformation kinetics are determined; the latter is\nstudied with particular emphasis on the Avrami exponent temporal behavior. It\nis shown that the surface-nucleated transformation qualitatively differs from\nthe bulk-nucleated one at large values of the characteristic parameters due to\nthe one-dimensional radial growth of the new phase occurring after the complete\ntransformation of the surface itself at the early stage of the process. This\neffect also manifests itself in the considered ensemble of size-distributed\nparticles and in the grain-boundary nucleated transformations. The logarithmic\nnormal distribution inherent for the particles obtained by grinding is employed\nfor numerical calculations and shown to stretch temporally the volume-fraction\nand Avrami-exponent dependences for the ensemble of identical particles. A new\nmodel for grain-boundary nucleated transformations alternative to the Cahn\nmodel of random planes is offered; it is based on the ensemble of\nsize-distributed spherical particles with the possibility for a growing nucleus\nto cross grain boundaries. The kinetics of this process is shown to be governed\nby the same characteristic parameter, as for a single particle, and\nqualitatively differs from the Cahn-model one. In particular, the logarithmic\nvolume-fraction plot at large values of the governing parameter ends by a\ncharacteristic bend observed on experimental curves for the crystallization of\nbulk metallic glasses. This peculiarity together with the form of the plot as a\nwhole directly indicates to the grain (polycluster) structure of metallic\nglasses and nucleation at intercluster boundaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2020 20:40:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-08"}

In particular, galaxy clustering and\ngravitational lensing convergence are probes sensitive to modifications of\ngeneral relativity. While the standard analysis for these surveys typically\nincludes power spectra or 2-point correlation functions, it is known that the\nbispectrum contains more information, and could offer improved constraints on\nparameters when combined with the power spectra. However, the use of bispectra\nhas been limited so far to one single probe, e.g. the lensing convergence\nbispectrum or the galaxy bispectrum. In this paper, we extend the formalism to\nexplore the power of cross-bispectra between different probes, and exploit\ntheir ability to break parameter degeneracies and improve constraints. We study\nthis on a test case of lensing convergence and galaxy density auto- and\ncross-bispectra, for a particular sub-class of Horndeski theories parametrized\nby $c_M$ and $c_B$. Using the 2000 deg$^2$ notional survey of the Nancy Grace\nRoman Space Telescope with overlapping photometry from the Rubin Observatory\nLegacy Survey of Space and Time, we find that a joint power spectra and\nbispectra analysis with three redshift bins at $l_{\\rm max} = 1000$ yields\n$\\sigma_{c_M} = 1.0$ and $\\sigma_{c_B} = 0.3$, both a factor of $\\sim$1.2\nbetter than the power spectra results; this would be further improved to\n$\\sigma_{c_M} = 0.7$ and $\\sigma_{c_B} = 0.2$ if $l_{\\rm max} = 3000$ is taken.\nFurthermore, we find that using all possible cross-bispectra between the two\nprobes in different tomographic bins improves upon auto-bispectra results by a\nfactor of 1.3 in $\\sigma_{c_M}$, 1.1 in $\\sigma_{c_B}$ and 1.3 in\n$\\sigma_{\\Omega_m}$.

In\nparticular, coupling the axions only to gluons is sufficient to generate a\nbaryon asymmetry in the presence of electroweak sphalerons or the Weinberg\noperator. Deriving the transport equation for an arbitrary set of couplings of\nthe axion-like particle, we provide a general framework in which these results\ncan be obtained immediately. If all the operators involved are efficient, it\nsuffices to solve an algebraic equation to obtain the final asymmetries.\nOtherwise one needs to solve a simple set of differential equations.

To this end we introduce an effective Hamiltonian formalism that\ndescribes electronic transitions and small (quantum) nuclear fluctuations along\na classical trajectory of the nuclei. Using this Hamiltonian we derive\nequations of motion for the electronic occupation numbers and for the nuclear\ncoordinates and momenta. We show that in the limit when the number of nuclear\ndegrees of freedom coupled to a given electronic transition is sufficiently\nhigh (i.e., the strong decoherence limit), the equations of motion for the\nelectronic occupation numbers become Markovian. Furthermore the transition\nrates in these (rate) equations are asymmetric with respect to the\nlower-to-higher energy transitions and vice versa. In thermal equilibrium such\nasymmetry corresponds to the detailed balance condition. We also study the\nequations for the electronic occupations in non-Markovian regime and develop a\nsurface hopping algorithm based on our formalism. To treat the decoherence\neffects we introduce additional \"virtual\" nuclear wavepackets whose\ninterference with the \"real\" (physical) wavepackets leads to the reduction in\ncoupling between the electronic states (i.e., decoherence) as well as to the\nphase shifts that improve the accuracy of the numerical approach. Remarkably,\nthe same phase shifts lead to the detailed balance condition in the strong\ndecoherence limit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2020 22:00:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-07"}

To ensure\nour graduates are agile and ready for the workforce, we are taking proactive\nmeasures to further improve their learning experiences. An important challenge\nstill impeding our students knowledge acquisition is the perception that\nprogram courses have disjointed learning outcomes. The course map of programs\nis carefully designed in such a way that technical skills acquired in\nparticular courses gradually build on each other. Despite the traditional\nexistence of prerequisites and co-requisites, the inaccurate view that courses\nfunction independently persists among students and, occasionally, among faculty\nmembers. One feasible approach to tackle this pedagogical challenge is to\ncombine various courses into an integrated learning block (ILB) having a\nunified mission and objective. At Sheridan's School of MEET, we are applying an\nILB with three engineering courses offered within the same semester for all our\nB.Eng. degree programs. The ILB deliverables are based on the design of a\nchosen engineering system or subunit in a project-based learning (PBL)\nenvironment. The rationale of this paper is to share our framework for\nimplementing an ILB in engineering programs and to examine the opportunities\nand challenges related to this type of curriculum design. In particular, we\nwill discuss the methodology by which courses are selected to form an ILB while\ntaking into account their appropriateness for an industry-driven PBL. This will\nbe followed up with some of the strategies that are proposed to evaluate the\nperformance of students in an ILB through formative and summative assessments\nbased on CDIO competencies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2020 22:00:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-08"}

In this article we discuss another astrophysically observable macroscopic\nproperty of neutron stars that can be used to study their interiors: their\ntidal deformation. Neutron stars, much like any other extended object with\nstructure, are tidally deformed when under the influence of an external tidal\nfield. In the context of coalescences of neutron stars observed through their\ngravitational wave emission, this deformation, quantified through a parameter\ntermed the \\emph{tidal deformability}, can be measured. We discuss the role of\nthe tidal deformability in observations of coalescing neutron stars with\ngravitational waves and how it can be used to probe the internal structure of\nNature's most compact matter objects. Perhaps inevitably, a large portion of\nthe discussion will be dictated by GW170817, the most informative confirmed\ndetection of a binary neutron star coalescence with gravitational waves as of\nthe time of writing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2020 23:23:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Nov 2020 00:13:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-13"}

In this paper, we present the first type-specific\napproach to generating adversarial examples for object detection, which entails\ndetecting bounding boxes around multiple objects present in the image and\nclassifying them at the same time, making it a harder task than against image\nclassification. We specifically aim to attack the widely used Faster R-CNN by\nchanging the predicted label for a particular object in an image: where prior\nwork has targeted one specific object (a stop sign), we generalise to arbitrary\nobjects, with the key challenge being the need to change the labels of all\nbounding boxes for all instances of that object type. To do so, we propose a\nnovel method, named Pick-Object-Attack. Pick-Object-Attack successfully adds\nperturbations only to bounding boxes for the targeted object, preserving the\nlabels of other detected objects in the image. In terms of perceptibility, the\nperturbations induced by the method are very small. Furthermore, for the first\ntime, we examine the effect of adversarial attacks on object detection in terms\nof a downstream task, image captioning; we show that where a method that can\nmodify all object types leads to very obvious changes in captions, the changes\nfrom our constrained attack are much less apparent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jun 2020 00:37:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Jul 2020 07:27:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 22 Aug 2021 02:46:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-24"}

Most of existing researches about diffusion of adoptions of new\nproducts on networks are about one diffusion. That is, only one piece of\ninformation about the product is spread on the network. However, in fact, one\nproduct may have multiple features and the information about different features\nmay spread independently in social network. When a user would like to purchase\nthe product, he would consider all of the features of the product\ncomprehensively not just consider one. Based on this, we propose a novel\nproblem, multi-feature budgeted profit maximization (MBPM) problem, which first\nconsiders budgeted profit maximization under multiple features propagation of\none product.\n  Given a social network with each node having an activation cost and a profit,\nMBPM problem seeks for a seed set with expected cost no more than the budget to\nmake the total expected profit as large as possible. We consider MBPM problem\nunder the adaptive setting, where seeds are chosen iteratively and next seed is\nselected according to current diffusion results. We study adaptive MBPM problem\nunder two models, oracle model and noise model. The oracle model assumes\nconditional expected marginal profit of any node could be obtained in O(1) time\nand a (1-1/e) expected approximation policy is proposed. Under the noise model,\nwe estimate conditional expected marginal profit of a node by modifying the\nEPIC algorithm and propose an efficient policy, which could return a\n(1-exp({\\epsilon}-1)) expected approximation ratio.

Furthermore, for the present model, it is demonstrated that the\neventual fate of the Universe is mostly insensitive to the initial conditions,\nin contrast to the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model.

However, most existing work focuses on the static transfer\nlearning setting, and very little is devoted to modeling the time evolving\ntarget domain, such as the online reviews for movies. To bridge this gap, in\nthis paper, we study a novel continuous transfer learning setting with a time\nevolving target domain. One major challenge associated with continuous transfer\nlearning is the potential occurrence of negative transfer as the target domain\nevolves over time. To address this challenge, we propose a novel label-informed\nC-divergence between the source and target domains in order to measure the\nshift of data distributions as well as to identify potential negative transfer.\nWe then derive the error bound for the target domain using the empirical\nestimate of our proposed C-divergence. Furthermore, we propose a generic\nadversarial Variational Auto-encoder framework named TransLATE by minimizing\nthe classification error and C-divergence of the target domain between\nconsecutive time stamps in a latent feature space. In addition, we define a\ntransfer signature for characterizing the negative transfer based on\nC-divergence, which indicates that larger C-divergence implies a higher\nprobability of negative transfer in real scenarios.

A broad family of model-based algorithms\nhave been derived to carry out inference at controllable complexity using\nrecursive computations over the factor graph representing the underlying\ndistribution. An alternative model-agnostic approach utilizes machine learning\n(ML) methods. Here we propose a framework that combines model-based algorithms\nand data-driven ML tools for stationary time sequences. In the proposed\napproach, neural networks are developed to separately learn specific components\nof a factor graph describing the distribution of the time sequence, rather than\nthe complete inference task. By exploiting stationary properties of this\ndistribution, the resulting approach can be applied to sequences of varying\ntemporal duration. Learned factor graph can be realized using compact neural\nnetworks that are trainable using small training sets, or alternatively, be\nused to improve upon existing deep inference systems. We present an inference\nalgorithm based on learned stationary factor graphs, which learns to implement\nthe sum-product scheme from labeled data, and can be applied to sequences of\ndifferent lengths.

For\ndeep learning, improvements in performance have to heavily rely on increasing\nmodel size or capacity to scale to larger and larger datasets, which inevitably\nleads to the increase of operations. A high number of operations in deep\nleaning increases computational cost and is not suitable for real-time HAR\nusing mobile and wearable sensors. Though shallow learning techniques often are\nlightweight, they could not achieve good performance. Therefore, deep learning\nmethods that can balance the trade-off between accuracy and computation cost is\nhighly needed, which to our knowledge has seldom been researched.

A\nmajor challenge that arises in this method is the need of each user to\nefficiently transmit its learned model over the throughput limited uplink\nchannel. In this work, we tackle this challenge using tools from quantization\ntheory. In particular, we identify the unique characteristics associated with\nconveying trained models over rate-constrained channels, and propose a suitable\nquantization scheme for such settings, referred to as universal vector\nquantization for FL (UVeQFed).

In this work, we propose to\naugment sparse Transformer blocks with a dense attention-based $\\textit{global\nmemory}$ of length $M$ ($\\ll L$) which provides an aggregate global view of the\nentire input sequence to each position. Our augmentation has a manageable\n$O(M\\cdot(L+M))$ memory overhead, and can be seamlessly integrated with prior\nsparse solutions. Moreover, global memory can also be used for sequence\ncompression, by representing a long input sequence with the memory\nrepresentations only. We empirically show that our method leads to substantial\nimprovement on a range of tasks, including (a) synthetic tasks that require\nglobal reasoning, (b) masked language modeling, and (c) reading comprehension.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jun 2020 07:50:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-08"}

By investigating\nthe consequences of the Ultrapower Axiom under the hypothesis that there is a\nsupercompact cardinal, we provide evidence that the inner model problem can be\nsolved. Moreover, we establish that under the Ultrapower Axiom, strong\ncompactness and supercompactness are essentially equivalent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jun 2020 08:24:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-08"}

In this work we use a Bayesian approach to obtain the current best\nassessment of the distribution of 13CO from the Galactic Ring Survey. We\nperformed two different distance estimates that either included or excluded a\nmodel for Galactic features. We also include a prior for the solution of the\nkinematic distance ambiguity that was determined from a compilation of\nliterature distances and an assumed size-linewidth relationship. We find that\nthe fraction of 13CO emission associated with spiral arm features varies from\n76% to 84% between the two distance runs. The vertical distribution of the gas\nis concentrated around the Galactic midplane showing FWHM values of ~75 pc. We\ndo not find any significant difference between gas emission properties\nassociated with spiral arm and interarm features. In particular the\ndistribution of velocity dispersion values of gas emission in spurs and spiral\narms is very similar. We detect a trend of higher velocity dispersion values\nwith increasing heliocentric distance, which we attribute to beam averaging\neffects caused by differences in spatial resolution. We argue that the true\ndistribution of the gas emission is likely more similar to a combination of our\ntwo distance results, and highlight the importance of using complementary\ndistance estimations to safeguard against the pitfalls of any single approach.\nWe conclude that the methodology presented in this work is a promising way to\ndetermine distances to gas emission features in Galactic plane surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jun 2020 08:25:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-19"}

It refers to the\nability of a biometric sample to be used for recognition purposes and produce\nconsistent, accurate, and reliable results. Such a subjective term is\nobjectively estimated by the so-called biometric quality metrics.

Recent\nchemical models predict that the latter may lead to a depletion of $^{13}$C in\nnitrile-bearing species, with $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios two times higher than\nthe elemental abundance ratio of 68 in the local ISM. Since the carbon isotopic\nratio is commonly used to evaluate the $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N ratios with the\ndouble-isotope method, it is important to study C-fractionation in detail to\navoid incorrect assumptions. In this work we implemented a gas-grain chemical\nmodel with new isotopic exchange reactions and investigated their introduction\nin the context of dense and cold molecular gas. In particular, we investigated\nthe $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios of HNC, HCN, and CN using a grid of models, with\ntemperatures and densities ranging from 10 to 50 K and 2$\\times$10$^{3}$ to\n2$\\times$10$^{7}$ cm$^{-3}$, respectively. We suggest a possible $^{13}$C\nexchange through the $^{13}$C + C$_{3}$ $\\rightarrow$ $^{12}$C +$^{13}$CC$_{2}$\nreaction, which does not result in dilution, but rather in $^{13}$C\nenhancement, for molecules formed starting from atomic carbon. This effect is\nefficient in a range of time between the formation of CO and its freeze-out on\ngrains. Furthermore, we show that the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios of nitriles are\npredicted to be a factor 0.8-1.9 different from the local value of 68 for\nmassive star-forming regions. This result also affects the $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N\nratio: a value of 330 obtained with the double-isotope method is predicted to\nbe 260-1150, depending on the physical conditions. Finally, we studied the\n$^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios by varying the cosmic-ray ionization rate: the ratios\nincrease with it because of secondary photons and cosmic-ray reactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jun 2020 10:50:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Oct 2020 08:33:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-05"}

Recent formal approaches,\nproposed by Halpern and Pearl, have made this concept mature enough to be\namenable to automated reasoning.

Previous approaches presented either inefficient\nor restricted, and domain-specific, solutions to the problem of automating\ncausality reasoning. In this paper, we present a novel approach to formulate\ndifferent notions of causal reasoning, over binary acyclic models, as\noptimization problems, based on quantifiable notions within counterfactual\ncomputations.

In particular, numerical\nsolutions of the space-DG0 discretised one-dimensional shallow water equations\nover varying topography are not truly `well-balanced'. A numerical scheme is\nwell-balanced if trivial steady states are satisfied in the numerical solution;\nin the case of the shallow water equations, initialised rest flow should remain\nat rest for all times. Whilst the free-surface height and momentum remain\nconstant and zero, respectively, suggesting that the scheme is indeed\nwell-balanced, the fluid depth and topography evolve in time.

In this\npaper, we study the problem of computing distance-generalized core\ndecomposition on a network. A distance-generalized core, also termed $(k,\nh)$-core, is a maximal subgraph in which every vertex has at least $k$ other\nvertices at distance no larger than $h$. The state-of-the-art algorithm for\nsolving this problem is based on a peeling technique which iteratively removes\nthe vertex (denoted by $v$) from the graph that has the smallest $h$-degree.\nThe $h$-degree of a vertex $v$ denotes the number of other vertices that are\nreachable from $v$ within $h$ hops. Such a peeling algorithm, however, needs to\nfrequently recompute the $h$-degrees of $v$'s neighbors after deleting $v$,\nwhich is typically very costly for a large $h$. To overcome this limitation, we\npropose an efficient peeling algorithm based on a novel $h$-degree updating\ntechnique. Instead of recomputing the $h$-degrees, our algorithm can\ndynamically maintain the $h$-degrees for all vertices via exploring a very\nsmall subgraph, after peeling a vertex. We show that such an $h$-degree\nupdating procedure can be efficiently implemented by an elegant bitmap\ntechnique. In addition, we also propose a sampling-based algorithm and a\nparallelization technique to further improve the efficiency. Finally, we\nconduct extensive experiments on 12 real-world graphs to evaluate our\nalgorithms.

The energy of the solutions in the first branch\nbehaves as $E\\sim Q^{5/6}$ for small $Q$, where $Q$ stands for the $U(1)$\nNoether charge. For the large $Q$, it gradually deviates from the scaling\n$E\\sim Q^{5/6}$ and, for the $Q$-shells it is $E\\sim Q^{7/6}$, which forms the\nsecond branch. A coupling with gravity allows for harboring of the\nSchwarzschild black holes for the $Q$-shell solutions, forming the charged\nboson shells. The space-time then consist of a charged black hole in the\ninterior of the shell, surrounded by a $Q$-shell, and the outside becomes a\nReissner-Nordstr\\\"om space-time. These solutions inherit the scaling behavior\nof the flat space-time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jun 2020 13:24:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-12"}

We discuss one such\nexample, the multiferroic Cu$_3$Nb$_2$O$_8$, which is reported to undergo two\nmagnetic phase transitions, first to a spin density wave phase at $T_N \\approx\n26.5K$, and then to a helicoidal structure coupled to an electric polarization\nbelow $T_2 \\approx 24K$ [R. D. Johnson, et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., 107, 137205\n(2011)] which breaks the crystallographic inversion symmetry. We apply\nspherical polarimetry to confirm the low-temperature magnetic structure, yet\nonly observe a single magnetic phase transition to helicoidal order. We argue\nthat the reported spin density wave originates from a decoupling of the\ncomponents of the magnetic order parameter, as allowed by symmetry and driven\nby thermal fluctuations. This provides a mechanism for the magnetic, but not\nnuclear, structure to break inversion symmetry thereby creating an intermediate\nphase where the structure imitates a spin density wave. As the temperature is\nreduced, this intermediate structure destabilizes the crystal such that a\nstructural chirality is induced, as reflected by the emergence of the electric\npolarization, and the imitation spin density wave relaxes into a generic\nhelicoid. This provides a situation where the magnetic structure breaks\ninversion symmetry while the crystal structure remains centrosymmetric.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jun 2020 13:25:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-30"}

In earlier works, a similar\nphenomenon was shown to exist in simpler models such as linear regression,\nwhere the peak instead occurs when $N$ is equal to the input dimension $D$.\nSince both peaks coincide with the interpolation threshold, they are often\nconflated in the litterature. In this paper, we show that despite their\napparent similarity, these two scenarios are inherently different. In fact,\nboth peaks can co-exist when neural networks are applied to noisy regression\ntasks. The relative size of the peaks is then governed by the degree of\nnonlinearity of the activation function. Building on recent developments in the\nanalysis of random feature models, we provide a theoretical ground for this\nsample-wise triple descent. As shown previously, the nonlinear peak at\n$N\\!=\\!P$ is a true divergence caused by the extreme sensitivity of the output\nfunction to both the noise corrupting the labels and the initialization of the\nrandom features (or the weights in neural networks). This peak survives in the\nabsence of noise, but can be suppressed by regularization. In contrast, the\nlinear peak at $N\\!=\\!D$ is solely due to overfitting the noise in the labels,\nand forms earlier during training. We show that this peak is implicitly\nregularized by the nonlinearity, which is why it only becomes salient at high\nnoise and is weakly affected by explicit regularization.

In islanded\noperation mode, the primary and secondary frequency control, i.e., hydro\ngovernors and automatic generation control (AGC), are responsible for the\nfrequency stability. However, due to limited water storage capacity of\nrun-of-the-river hydropower and river dynamics constraints, without\ncoordination between the cascaded plants, the traditional AGC with fixed\nparticipation factors cannot fully exploit the adjustability of cascaded\nhydropower. When imbalances between the volatile energy and load occur, load\nshedding can be inevitable. To address this issue, this paper proposes a\ncoordinated tertiary control approach by jointly considering power system\ndynamics and the river dynamics that couples the cascaded hydropower plants.\nThe timescales of the power system and river dynamics are very different. To\nunify the multi-timescale dynamics to establish a model predictive controller\nthat coordinates the cascaded plants, the relation between AGC parameters and\nturbine discharge over a time interval is approximated by a data-based\nsecond-order polynomial surrogate model. The cascaded plants are coordinated by\noptimising AGC participation factors in a receding-horizon manner, and load\nshedding is minimised.

The first one relies on the presence of a solitonic limit of the\nblack holes; when the solitons have no spatial isometries, the black holes,\nbeing a non-linear bound state between the solitons and a horizon, inherit this\nproperty. The second one is related to black hole scalarization, and the\nexistence of zero modes of the scalar field without isometries around a\nspherical horizon. When the zero modes have no spatial isometries, the\nbackreaction of their non-linear continuation makes the scalarized black holes\ninherit the absence of spatial continuous symmetries.

These three methods are called conditional Wasserstein GAN (cWGAN),\nselective VAE (sVAE), and selective WGAN (sWGAN). To evaluate the effectiveness\nof these methods, we perform a systematic experimental study on two public EEG\ndatasets for emotion recognition, namely, SEED and DEAP.

A representative\nmetasurface is considered consisting of columns of time-modulated subwavelength\nunit cells, referred to as stixels. SD-TWM is achieved by enforcing a time\ndelay between temporal waveforms applied to adjacent columns. In contrast to\nthe continuous traveling-wave modulation commonly assumed in studies of\nspace-time metasurfaces, here the modulation is spatially discretized. In order\nto account for the discretized spatial modulation, a modified Floquet analysis\nis introduced based on a new boundary condition that has been derived for\nSD-TWM structures. The modified Floquet analysis separates the scattered field\ninto its macroscopic and microscopic variations. The reported theoretical and\nexperimental results reveal that the electromagnetic behavior of an SD-TWM\nmetasurface can be categorized into three regimes. For electrically-large\nspatial modulation periods, the microscopic field variation across each stixel\ncan be neglected. In this regime, the space-time metasurface allows\nsimultaneous frequency translation and angular deflection. When the spatial\nmodulation period on the metasurface is electrically small, the microscopic\nvariation results in new metasurface capabilities such as subharmonic mixing.\nWhen the spatial modulation period of the metasurface is wavelength-scale, the\nmetasurface allows both subharmonic mixing and angular deflection to be\nachieved simultaneously. To verify our analysis, a dual-polarized,\nspatio-temporally modulated metasurface, is developed and measured at X-band\nfrequencies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jun 2020 05:40:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 15 Nov 2020 07:16:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-04"}

We accomplish this by simulating the new boarding processes using\npedestrian dynamics and compare them against alternatives.

It also increases exposure by around 50% compared to a\ntypical boarding process prior to the outbreak of COVID-19. While keeping\nmiddle seats empty yields a substantial reduction in exposure, our results show\nthat the different boarding processes have similar relative strengths in this\ncase as with middle seats occupied.

The former define a commutative, associative, and\nidempotent join operation, and their states a monotone join semi-lattice.\nState-based CRDTs may be further distinguished into classical- and\n$\\delta$-state CRDTs. The former communicate their full state after each\nupdate, whereas the latter communicate only the changed state. Op-based CRDTs\ncommunicate operations (not state), thus making their updates non-idempotent.\nWhereas op-based CRDTs require little information to be exchanged, they demand\nrelatively strong network guarantees (exactly-once message delivery), and\nstate-based CRDTs suffer the opposite problem. Both satisfy strong eventual\nconsistency (SEC).\n  We posit that $\\delta$-state CRDTs both (1) require less communication\noverhead from payload size, and (2) tolerate relatively weak network\nenvironments, making them an ideal candidate for real-world use of CRDTs. Our\ncentral intuition is a pair of reductions between state-, $\\delta$-state, and\nop-based CRDTs. We formalize this intuition in the Isabelle interactive theorem\nprover and show that state-based CRDTs achieve SEC. We present a relaxed\nnetwork model in Isabelle and show that state-based CRDTs still maintain SEC.\nFinally, we extend our work to show that $\\delta$-state CRDTs maintain SEC when\nonly communicating $\\delta$-state fragments, even under relatively weak network\nconditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 5 Jun 2020 04:32:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-18"}
