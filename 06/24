In VVC, the\nquad-tree plus multi-type tree (QTMT) structure of coding unit (CU) partition\naccounts for over 97% of the encoding time, due to the brute-force search for\nrecursive rate-distortion (RD) optimization. Instead of the brute-force QTMT\nsearch, this paper proposes a deep learning approach to predict the QTMT-based\nCU partition, for drastically accelerating the encoding process of intra-mode\nVVC. First, we establish a large-scale database containing sufficient CU\npartition patterns with diverse video content, which can facilitate the\ndata-driven VVC complexity reduction. Next, we propose a multi-stage exit CNN\n(MSE-CNN) model with an early-exit mechanism to determine the CU partition, in\naccord with the flexible QTMT structure at multiple stages. Then, we design an\nadaptive loss function for training the MSE-CNN model, synthesizing both the\nuncertain number of split modes and the target on minimized RD cost. Finally, a\nmulti-threshold decision scheme is developed, achieving desirable trade-off\nbetween complexity and RD performance.

However, the continuous need to update the features of games\nin less duration might compel the developers to use anti-patterns, code smells\nand quick-fix solutions that may affect the functional and non-functional\nrequirements of the game. These bad practices may lead to technical debt, poor\nprogram comprehension, and can cause several issues during software\nmaintenance. Here, in this paper, we introduce \"Software Nuggets\" as a concept\nthat affects software quality in a negative way and as a superset of\nanti-patterns, code smells, bugs, software bad practices. We call these\nSoftware Nuggets as \"G-Nuggets\" in the context of games. While there exists\nempirical research on games, we are not aware of any work on understanding and\ncataloguing these G-Nuggets. Thus, we propose a catalogue of G-Nuggets by\nmining and analyzing 892 commits, 189 issues, and 104 pull requests from 100\nopen-source GitHub game repositories. We use regular expressions and thematic\nanalysis on this dataset for cataloguing game-specific Software Nuggets.

That is why, it is crucial to understand\nmetastases evolution in order to successfully combat the disease. We consider a\nmetastasized cancer cell population after medical treatment (e.g.\nchemotherapy). Arriving in a different environment the cancer cells may change\ntheir lifespan and reproduction, thus they may proliferate into different\ntypes. If the treatment is effective, in the context of branching processes it\nmeans, the reproduction of cancer cells is such that the mean offspring of each\ncell is less than one. However, it is possible mutations to occur during cell\ndivision cycle. These mutations can produce a new cancer cell type, which is\nresistant to the treatment. Cancer cells from this new type may lead to the\nrise of a non-extinction branching process. The above scenario leads us to the\nchoice of a reducible multi-type age-dependent branching process as a relevant\nframework for studying the asymptotic behavior of such complex structures. Our\nprevious theoretical results are related to the asymptotic behavior of the\nwaiting time until the first occurrence of a mutant starting a non-extinction\nprocess and the modified hazard function as a measure of immediate recurrence\nof cancer disease. In the present paper these asymptotic results are used for\ndeveloping numerical schemes and algorithms implemented in Python via the NumPy\npackage for approximate calculation of the corresponding quantities. In\nconclusion, our conjecture is that this methodology can be advantageous in\nrevealing the role of the lifespan distribution of the cancer cells in the\ncontext of cancer disease evolution and other complex cell population systems,\nin general.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2020 16:24:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-24"}

In fact, often\nmultiple different classifiers give almost equal solutions. This phenomenon is\nknown as predictive multiplicity (Breiman, 2001; Marx et al., 2019).

In this work, we\npresent a strategy for learning a calibrated predictive distribution over\nsemantic maps, where the probability associated with each prediction reflects\nits ground truth correctness likelihood.

The derivation is based on\nadiabatic turning on of the perturbation as used, for instance, in some formal\ndevelopments of scattering theory. Energy conservation is expressed in terms of\nan intuitively and physically appealing Lorentzian line shape rather than the\nartificial, oscillatory sin(x)=x type line shape that appears in conventional\nderivations. The conditions for the derivation's validity are compactly and\nconveniently expressed in the frequency/energy domain rather than in the usual\ntime domain. The derivation also highlights how, along with energy\nconservation, the transition rate faithfully and instantaneously follows the\nvariations in the square of the perturbing potential as one may expect in the\nadiabatic limit. In the first instance, the adiabatic turning on is achieved,\nas usual, by a single exponential time variation. But we demonstrate that the\ninstantaneous following of the square of the perturbing potential by the\ntransition rate is more general and that one can derive the Golden Rule for a\ngeneral slowly varying time dependent perturbation. This allows one to derive\ngeneralisations of the simple decay law, originally derived in the classic\npaper by Weisskopf and Wigner; a tutorial exposition of the essence of this\nclassic work is provided. The Oppenheimer method for applying the Golden rule\nto problems, such as the electric field ionisation of atoms, in which the\nperturbing potential can also create the final states, is reviewed. No use of\nan energy gap condition is needed to derive our results on adiabatic behaviour\nin contrast to the origianl derivations of the adiabatic theorem in quantum\nmechanics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2020 17:30:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-24"}

The first method mirrors the usual derivation of the hydrodynamic\nequations of motion by relating conserved---or to account for chemical\nreactions, non-conserved---currents to local-equilibrium parameters. The second\nmethod involves a higher-brow approach in which we attack the same problem from\nthe perspective of non-equilibrium effective field theory (EFT).\nNon-equilibrium effective actions are defined using the in-in formalism on the\nSchwinger-Keldysh contour and are therefore capable of describing thermal\nfluctuations and dissipation as well as quantum effects. The non-equilibrium\nEFT approach is especially powerful as all terms in the action are fully\nspecified by the symmetries of the system; in particular the second law of\nthermodynamics does not need to be included by hand, but is instead derived\nfrom the action itself. We find that the equations of motion generated by both\nmethods agree, but the EFT approach yields certain advantages. To demonstrate\nsome of these advantages we construct a quadratic action that is valid to very\nsmall distance scales---much smaller than the scales at which ordinary\nhydrodynamic theories break down. Such an action captures the full\nthermodynamic and quantum behavior of reactions and diffusion at quadratic\norder. Finally, taking the low-frequency and low-wavenumber limit, we reproduce\nthe linearized version of the well-known reaction-diffusion equations as a\nfinal coherence check.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2020 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-25"}

The Be phenomenon is\nstrongly correlated with rapid rotation, the origin of which remains unclear.\nIt may be rooted in single- or binary-star evolution. In the framework of the\nbinary channel, the initially more massive star transfers mass and angular\nmomentum to the original secondary, which becomes a Be star. The system then\nevolves into a Be binary with a post-main-sequence companion, which may later\nbe disrupted in a supernova event. Hence, if the binary channel dominates the\nformation of Be stars, one may expect a strong lack of close Be binaries with\nmain sequence (MS) companions. Through an extensive, star-by-star review of the\nliterature of a magnitude-limited sample of Galactic early-type Be stars, we\ninvestigate whether Be binaries with MS companions are known to exist. Our\nsample is constructed from the BeSS database and cross-matched with all\navailable literature on the individual stars. Out of an initial list of 505 Be\nstars, we compile a final sample of 287 Galactic Be stars earlier than B1.5\nwith V<=12 mag.

We find no confirmed reports of Be binaries with MS companions. For\nthe remaining 263 targets, no significant reports of multiplicity exist in the\nliterature, implying that they are either Be binaries with faint companions, or\ntruly single. The clear lack of reported MS companions to Be stars, which\nstands in contrast to the high number of detected B+B MS binaries, strongly\nsupports the hypothesis that early-type Be stars are binary interaction\nproducts that spun up after mass and angular momentum transfer from a companion\nstar. Taken at face value, our results may suggest that a large majority of the\nearly-type Be stars have formed through binary mass-transfer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2020 18:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-09"}

To attract students' interest, the recommendation system\nis applied by MOOCs providers to recommend courses to students. However, as a\ncourse usually consists of a number of video lectures, with each one covering\nsome specific knowledge concepts, directly recommending courses overlook\nstudents'interest to some specific knowledge concepts.

To address this\nissue, we leverage both content information and context information to learn\nthe representation of entities via graph convolution network. In addition to\nstudents and knowledge concepts, we consider other types of entities (e.g.,\ncourses, videos, teachers) and construct a heterogeneous information network to\ncapture the corresponding fruitful semantic relationships among different types\nof entities and incorporate them into the representation learning process.\nSpecifically, we use meta-path on the HIN to guide the propagation of students'\npreferences. With the help of these meta-paths, the students' preference\ndistribution with respect to a candidate knowledge concept can be captured.\nFurthermore, we propose an attention mechanism to adaptively fuse the context\ninformation from different meta-paths, in order to capture the different\ninterests of different students.

Methods: In this paper, we present our argument regarding the\nefficiency and applicability of existing deep learning models for COVID-19\ndiagnosis. We provide results from two popular models - COVID-Net and CoroNet\nevaluated on three publicly available datasets and an additional institutional\ndataset collected from EMORY Hospital between January and May 2020, containing\npatients tested for COVID-19 infection using RT-PCR. Results: There is a large\nfalse positive rate (FPR) for COVID-Net on both ChexPert (55.3%) and MIMIC-CXR\n(23.4%) dataset. On the EMORY Dataset, COVID-Net has 61.4% sensitivity, 0.54\nF1-score and 0.49 precision value.

This is likely from several causes\nincluding overfitting models due to lack of appropriate control patients and\nground truth labels. The fourth institutional dataset was labeled using RT-PCR,\nwhich could be positive without radiographic findings and vice versa.\nTherefore, a fusion model of both clinical and radiographic data may have\nbetter performance and generalization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2020 18:35:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-25"}

Fourteen significant mediations (metabolite = mediator; miRNA\n= independent variable; VR score = dependent variable) were discovered at\npreseason (N=6) and across season (N=8) with Sobel p-values less than or equal\nto 0.05 and with total effects at or exceeding 50%. The majority of mediation\nfindings involved long to medium chain fatty acids (2-HG, 8-HOA, UND, sebacate,\nsuberate, and heptanoate). In parallel, TCA metabolites were found to be\nsignificantly decreased at postseason relative to preseason. HAEs were\nassociated with metabolomic measures and miRNA levels across-season. Together,\nthese observations suggest a state of chronic HAE-induced neuroinflammation (as\nevidence by elevated miRNAs) and mitochondrial dysfunction (as observed by\nabnormal FAs and TCA metabolites) that together produce subtle changes in\nneurological function (as observed by impaired motor control behavior). These\nfindings point to a shift in mitochondrial metabolism, away from mitochondria\nfunction, consistent with other illnesses classified as mitochondrial\ndisorders, suggesting a plausible mechanism underlying HAEs in contact sports\nand potential avenue for treatment intervention.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2020 18:43:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-25"}

Numerical analyses of a prototype\nhybrid SRAM array of 64 KB show a factor of 7 and 34 reduction in read delay\nand read energy consumption, respectively; and 4 and 6 in write delay and write\nenergy con-sumption, respectively, when the access FETs are replaced by LETs.\nThe potential impacts on the peripheral and assist cir-cuits due to this hybrid\nstructure and application of the LETs there are also briefly discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2020 19:32:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 12 Jul 2020 18:40:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 2020 19:39:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-08"}

While NAS offers great promise, the prohibitive computational\ndemand of most of the existing NAS methods makes it difficult to directly\nsearch the architectures on large-scale tasks. The typical way of conducting\nlarge scale NAS is to search for an architectural building block on a small\ndataset (either using a proxy set from the large dataset or a completely\ndifferent small scale dataset) and then transfer the block to a larger dataset.\nDespite a number of recent results that show the promise of transfer from proxy\ndatasets, a comprehensive evaluation of different NAS methods studying the\nimpact of different source datasets has not yet been addressed.

Given a known set of motifs, can a new\nmotif be learned without affecting the performance of the known set and then\nused in new sequences without first explicitly learning every possible\ntransition? Two requirements enable this: (i) parameter updates while learning\na new motif do not interfere with the parameters used for the previously\nacquired ones; and (ii) a new motif can be robustly generated when starting\nfrom the network state reached at the end of any of the other motifs, even if\nthat state was not present during training. We meet the first requirement by\ninvestigating artificial neural networks (ANNs) with specific architectures,\nand attempt to meet the second by training them to generate motifs from random\ninitial states. We find that learning of single motifs succeeds but that\nsequence generation is not robust: transition failures are observed. We then\ncompare these results with a model whose architecture and\nanalytically-tractable dynamics are inspired by the motor thalamocortical\ncircuit, and that includes a specific module used to implement motif\ntransitions.

Indeed, in\nsimulations, we achieve single-motif accuracy on par with the previously\nstudied ANNs and have improved sequencing robustness with no transition\nfailures. Finally, we show that insights obtained by studying the transition\nsubnetwork of this model can also improve the robustness of transitioning in\nthe traditional ANNs previously studied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2020 21:08:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-25"}

On the other hand, Lie algebraic\nrepresentations of the transformations therein were introduced to overcome the\ndifficulties behind group structure by mapping the transformation groups to\nlinear spaces. In this paper we focus on application of Lie groups and Lie\nalgebras to find the rigid transformation that best register two surfaces\nrepresented by point clouds. The so called pairwise rigid registration can be\nformulated by comparing intrinsic second-order orientation tensors that encode\nlocal geometry. These tensors can be (locally) represented by symmetric\nnon-negative definite matrices. In this paper we interpret the obtained tensor\nfield as a multivariate normal model. So, we start with the fact that the space\nof Gaussians can be equipped with a Lie group structure, that is isomorphic to\na subgroup of the upper triangular matrices. Consequently, the associated Lie\nalgebra structure enables us to handle Gaussians, and consequently, to compare\norientation tensors, with Euclidean operations. We apply this methodology to\nvariants of the Iterative Closest Point (ICP), a known technique for pairwise\nregistration. We compare the obtained results with the original implementations\nthat apply the comparative tensor shape factor (CTSF), which is a similarity\nnotion based on the eigenvalues of the orientation tensors. We notice that the\nsimilarity measure in tensor spaces directly derived from Lie's approach is not\ninvariant under rotations, which is a problem in terms of rigid registration.\nDespite of this, the performed computational experiments show promising results\nwhen embedding orientation tensor fields in Lie algebras.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2020 21:26:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-25"}

In this paper, we show how to find small networks that exhibit the same\nperformance as their overparameterized counterparts after only a few training\nepochs. We find that hidden layer activations in overparameterized networks\nexist primarily in subspaces smaller than the actual model width. Building on\nthis observation, we use PCA to find a basis of high variance for layer inputs\nand represent layer weights using these directions. We eliminate all weights\nnot relevant to the found PCA basis and term these network architectures\nPrincipal Component Networks. On CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, we show that PCNs train\nfaster and use less energy than overparameterized models, without accuracy\nloss. We find that our transformation leads to networks with up to 23.8x fewer\nparameters, with equal or higher end-model accuracy---in some cases we observe\nimprovements up to 3%.

Robotic\nsampling systems can ease these burdens, but little work has examined the\nefficiency of such sampling means and no prior work has investigated the\nquality of the resulting samples. This paper presents an experimental study\nthat evaluates and optimizes sediment sampling patterns applied to a robot\nsediment sampling system that allows collection of minimally-disturbed sediment\ncores from natural and man-made water bodies for various sediment types. To\nmeet this need, we developed and tested a robotic sampling platform in the\nlaboratory to test functionality under a range of sediment types and operating\nconditions. Specifically, we focused on three patterns by which a cylindrical\ncoring device was driven into the sediment (linear, helical, and zig-zag) for\nthree sediment types (coarse sand, medium sand, and silt). The results show\nthat the optimal sampling pattern varies depending on the type of sediment and\ncan be optimized based on the sampling objective. We examined two sampling\nobjectives: maximizing the mass of minimally disturbed sediment and minimizing\nthe power per mass of sample.

Limiting transit capacity to 50% would\ndecrease transit ridership further from 73% to 64% while increasing car trips\nto as much as 143% of pre-pandemic levels. While the increase appears small,\nthe impact on consumer surplus is disproportionately large due to already\nincreased traffic congestion. Many of the trips also get shifted to other modes\nlike micromobility.

Since the original uncertainty of the\ntarget observable causes fluctuating phase shifts in the probe qubit, any\nadditional information obtained about the target observable can be used to\ncompensate a part of the decoherence by applying a conditional phase shift to\nthe reference qubit. The magnitude of this negative feedback corresponds to an\nestimate of the target observable, and the uncompensated decoherence defines\nthe uncertainty of that estimate. The results of the analysis show that the\nuncertainties of the estimates are given by the uncertainties introduced by\nOzawa in Phys. Rev. A 67, 042105 (2003) and the optimal estimates are given by\nthe weak values associated with the different measurement outcomes. Feedback\ncompensation of decoherence therefore demonstrates the empirical validity of\ndefinitions of errors and estimates that combine the initial information of the\ninput state with the additional information provided by each measurement\noutcome.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jun 2020 00:33:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Jun 2020 00:58:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 2020 01:44:30 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 15 Nov 2020 23:19:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-10"}

Learning\ncontrollable embedding (LCE) is a promising approach that addresses this\nchallenge by embedding the observations into a lower-dimensional latent space,\nestimating the latent dynamics, and utilizing it to perform control in the\nlatent space. Two important questions in this area are how to learn a\nrepresentation that is amenable to the control problem at hand, and how to\nachieve an end-to-end framework for representation learning and control. In\nthis paper, we take a few steps towards addressing these questions. We first\nformulate a LCE model to learn representations that are suitable to be used by\na policy iteration style algorithm in the latent space. We call this model\ncontrol-aware representation learning (CARL). We derive a loss function for\nCARL that has close connection to the prediction, consistency, and curvature\n(PCC) principle for representation learning. We derive three implementations of\nCARL. In the offline implementation, we replace the locally-linear control\nalgorithm (e.g.,~iLQR) used by the existing LCE methods with a RL algorithm,\nnamely model-based soft actor-critic, and show that it results in significant\nimprovement. In online CARL, we interleave representation learning and control,\nand demonstrate further gain in performance. Finally, we propose value-guided\nCARL, a variation in which we optimize a weighted version of the CARL loss\nfunction, where the weights depend on the TD-error of the current policy.

A key unknown in simulating secondary\nbreakup in turbulent multiphase jets is the inflow size distribution generated\nwithin the primary breakup zone near the nozzle exit. A mono-disperse injection\ninflow condition is commonly used for simplicity, but this choice is often\nunrealistic. In order to provide more realistic inlet conditions for LES, we\ndevelop a one dimensional (1D) parcel model to predict the evolution of the\ndispersed phase along the jet centerline due to the combined effects of\nadvection, radial turbulent transport and droplet breakup due to turbulence in\nthe regions closer to the jet nozzle that cannot be resolved using coarse LES.\nThe model is validated with experimental data measured far from the nozzle. The\n1D model is also used to generate an initial size distribution for use in a\ncoarse-resolution LES of a turbulent jet. Number density fields for each bin of\nthe discretized droplet size distribution are modeled using an Eulerian LES\napproach and scalar transport equations are solved for each bin. LES results\nare compared to published experimental data, with good agreement and we examine\nthe statistics of the velocity field and the concentration of the polydisperse\noil droplet plumes for two droplet Weber numbers. We find that the centerline\ndecay rate of the concentration for different droplet sizes is modified in the\nbreakup dominated zone. Unlike Reynolds averaged approaches, LES also allows us\nto quantify size distribution variability due to turbulence. We quantify the\nradial and axial distributions and the variability of key quantities such as\nthe Sauter mean diameter, total surface area and droplet breakup time-scale and\nexplore their sensitivity to the Weber number.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jun 2020 01:45:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 00:21:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-12"}

The concept is defined by\nthe difference between the sum of internal angles of two triangles; one of the\ntriangles lies on curved spacetime distorted by a gravitating body and the\nother on its background. The triangle required to define the total deflection\nangle can be realized by setting three laser-beam baselines as in planned space\nmissions such as LATOR, ASTROD-GW, and LISA. Accordingly, the new total\ndeflection angle is, in principle, measurable by gauging the internal angles of\nthe triangles. The new definition of the total deflection angle can provide a\ngeometrically and intuitively clear interpretation. Two formulas are proposed\nto calculate the total deflection angle on the basis of the Gauss--Bonnet\ntheorem.

The PSI can\nwork as a sensitive multi-axes gyroscope that can automatically filter out the\nsignal from accelerations. The phase shift arising from rotations is\nproportional to the momentum transferred to each atom from the Raman pulses.\nTherefore, by increasing the momentum transfer, it should be possibly to\nenhance the sensitivity of the PSI. Here, we investigate the degree of\nenhancement in sensitivity that could be achieved by augmenting the PSI with\nlarge momentum transfer (LMT) employing a sequence of many Raman pulses with\nalternating directions. Contrary to typical approaches used for describing a\nPSI, we employ a model under which the motion of the center of mass of each\natom is described quantum mechanically. We show how increasing Doppler shifts\nlead to imperfections, thereby limiting the visibility of the signal fringes,\nand identify ways to suppress this effect by increasing the effective,\ntwo-photon Rabi frequencies of the Raman pulses. Taking into account the effect\nof spontaneous emission, we show that, for a given value of the one-photon Rabi\nfrequency, there is an optimum value for the number of pulses employed, beyond\nwhich the net enhancement in sensitivity begins to decrease. For a one-photon\nRabi frequency of 200 MHz, for example, the peak value of the factor of\nenhancement in sensitivity is ~39, for a momentum transfer that is ~69 times as\nlarge as that for a conventional PSI.

Jiang and Li [SICOMP'95] showed\nthat if Max-Clique is hard to approximate within a factor of $s$ then Multi-LCS\nis also hard to approximate within a factor of $\\Theta(s)$. By the NP-hardness\nof the problem of approximating Max-Clique by Zuckerman [ToC'07], for any\nconstant $\\delta>0$, the length of a LCS of arbitrary number of input sequences\nof length $n$ each, cannot be approximated within an $n^{1-\\delta}$-factor in\npolynomial time unless {\\tt{P}}$=${\\NP}.

Conventional\nstudies for such polarization independence are generally restricted to special\nstates of either linear or circular polarizations, widely neglecting\nelliptically-polarized states that are generically present in realistic\napplications. Here we present a comprehensive recipe to achieve invariant\nscattering properties (including extinction, scattering and absorption) for\narbitrary polarizations, requiring only rotation symmetry and absence of\noptical activities. It is discovered that sole rotation symmetries can\neffectively decouple the two scattering channels that originate from the\nincident circularly polarized waves of opposite handedness, leading to\ninvariance of all scattering properties for any polarizations on the same\nlatitude circle of the Poincar\\'{e} sphere.

In sharp\ncontrast to previous investigations that rely heavily on complicated algebraic\nformulas, our arguments are fully intuitive and geometric, bringing to surface\nthe essential physical principles rather than obscuring them.

We start by a thorough characterization of the class of\ncontinuous submodular functions, and show that continuous submodularity is\nequivalent to a weak version of the diminishing returns (DR) property. Thus we\nalso derive a subclass of continuous submodular functions, termed continuous\nDR-submodular functions, which enjoys the full DR property.

Clique counting is itself considered a challenging problem. Counting\nnear-cliques is significantly harder more so since the search space for\nnear-cliques is orders of magnitude larger than that of cliques.\n  We give a formulation of a near-clique as a clique that is missing a constant\nnumber of edges. We exploit the fact that a near-clique contains a smaller\nclique, and use techniques for clique sampling to count near-cliques. This\nmethod allows us to count near-cliques with 1 or 2 missing edges, in graphs\nwith tens of millions of edges. To the best of our knowledge, there was no\nknown efficient method for this problem, and we obtain a 10x - 100x speedup\nover existing algorithms for counting near-cliques.\n  Our main technique is a space-efficient adaptation of the Tur\\'an Shadow\nsampling approach, recently introduced by Jain and Seshadhri (WWW 2017).

The simulations are performed in the temporal\nconfiguration with very large domain sizes, to allow the mixing layers to reach\nprolonged states of fully-turbulent self-similar growth. Imposing a mean\ndensity variation breaks the mean symmetry relative to the classical\nsingle-fluid temporal mixing layer problem. Unlike prior variable-density\nmixing layer simulations in which the streams are composed of the same fluids\nwith dissimilar thermodynamic properties, the density variations are presently\ndue to compositional differences between the fluid streams, leading to\ndifferent mixing dynamics. Variable-density (non-Boussinesq) effects introduce\nstrong asymmetries in the flow statistics that can be explained by the\nstrongest turbulence increasingly migrating to the lighter fluid side as free\nstream density difference increases. Interface thickness growth rates also\nreduce, with some thickness definitions particularly sensitive to the\ncorresponding changes in alignment between density and streamwise velocity\nprofiles. Additional asymmetries in the sense of statistical distributions of\ndensities at a given position within the mixing layer reveal that fine scales\nof turbulence are preferentially sustained in lighter fluid, which also is\nwhere fastest mixing occurs.

Some of the variables that we\nstudy are: 1) the effect of using LinkedIn as a medium for delivering the\nphishing message instead of using email, 2) the effectiveness of natural\nlanguage generation techniques in generating phishing emails, and 3) how some\nsimple customizations, e.g., adding sender's contact info to the email, affect\nparticipants perception. The results obtained from the within-subject study\nshow that participants are not prepared even for a well-known attack - company\nrepresentative fraud. Findings include: approximately 65% mean detection rate\nand insights into how the success rate changes with the facade and\ncorrespondent (sender/receiver) information. A significant finding is that a\nsmaller set of well-chosen strategies is better than a large `mess' of\nstrategies. We also find significant differences in how males and females\napproach the same company representative fraud. Insights from our work could\nhelp defenders in developing better strategies to evaluate their defenses and\nin devising better training strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jun 2020 05:57:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-25"}

Methods: Participants were imaged with 4.5X4.5-mm volumetric disc\nscans using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT). The normalized\nNFL reflectance map was processed by an azimuthal filter to reduce directional\nreflectance bias due to variation of beam incidence angle. The peripapillary\narea of the map was divided into 160 superpixels. Average reflectance was the\nmean of superpixel reflectance. Low-reflectance superpixels were identified as\nthose with NFL reflectance below the 5 percentile normative cutoff. Focal\nreflectance loss was measure by summing loss in low-reflectance superpixels.\nResults: Thirty-five normal, 30 pre-perimetric and 35 perimetric glaucoma\nparticipants were enrolled. Azimuthal filtering improved the repeatability of\nthe normalized NFL reflectance, as measured by the pooled superpixel standard\ndeviation (SD), from 0.73 to 0.57 dB (p<0.001, paired t-test) and reduced the\npopulation SD from 2.14 to 1.78 dB (p<0.001, t-test).

Conclusions: Azimuthal filtering\nreduces the variability of NFL reflectance measurements. Focal NFL reflectance\nloss has excellent glaucoma diagnostic accuracy compared to the standard NFL\nthickness parameters.

More specifically, we ask whether\nand under which conditions school segregation could be reduced if more parents\nhold tolerant ethnic preferences. We move beyond earlier models of school\nsegregation in three ways. First, we model individual school choices using a\nrandom utility discrete choice approach. Second, we vary the pattern of ethnic\nsegregation in the residential context of school choices systematically,\ncomparing residential maps in which segregation is unrelated to parents' level\nof tolerance to residential maps reflecting their ethnic preferences. Thirdly,\nwe introduce heterogeneity in tolerance levels among parents belonging to the\nsame group.

The cluster possesses a number of remarkable features including a bright\nradio relic with a steep spectrum, more than three distinct galaxy groups\nforming a filament, and two disturbed X-ray peaks at odds with the distant\nposition and tilted orientation of the radio relic. These several lines of\nevidence indicate a complex merger. In this paper, we present a\nmulti-wavelength study of A521 based on Subaru optical, Hubble Space Telescope\ninfrared, Chandra X-ray, GMRT radio, and MMT optical spectroscopic\nobservations. Our weak-lensing (WL) analysis with improved systematics control\nreveals that A521 is mainly composed of three substructures aligned in the\nnorthwest to southeast orientation. These WL mass substructures are remarkably\nwell-aligned with the cluster optical luminosity distribution constructed from\nour new enhanced cluster member catalog. These individual substructure masses\nare determined by simultaneously fitting three NFW profiles. We find that the\ntotal mass of A521 modeled by the superposition of the three halos is\n$13.0_{-1.3}^{+1.0} \\times 10^{14}M_{\\odot}$, a factor of two higher than the\nprevious WL measurement. With these WL mass constraints combined with X-ray and\nradio features, we consider two merging scenarios, carry out the corresponding\nnumerical simulations, and discuss strengths and weaknesses of each case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jun 2020 07:42:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2020 14:28:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-18"}

Their language learning seems to occur simultaneously with learning\nother cognitive functions as well as with playful interactions with the\nenvironment and caregivers. From a neuroscientific perspective, natural\nlanguage is embodied, grounded in most, if not all, sensory and sensorimotor\nmodalities, and acquired by means of crossmodal integration. However,\ncharacterising the underlying mechanisms in the brain is difficult and\nexplaining the grounding of language in crossmodal perception and action\nremains challenging. In this paper, we present a neurocognitive model for\nlanguage grounding which reflects bio-inspired mechanisms such as an implicit\nadaptation of timescales as well as end-to-end multimodal abstraction. It\naddresses developmental robotic interaction and extends its learning\ncapabilities using larger-scale knowledge-based data. In our scenario, we\nutilise the humanoid robot NICO in obtaining the EMIL data collection, in which\nthe cognitive robot interacts with objects in a children's playground\nenvironment while receiving linguistic labels from a caregiver. The model\nanalysis shows that crossmodally integrated representations are sufficient for\nacquiring language merely from sensory input through interaction with objects\nin an environment. The representations self-organise hierarchically and embed\ntemporal and spatial information through composition and decomposition. This\nmodel can also provide the basis for further crossmodal integration of\nperceptually grounded cognitive representations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jun 2020 08:12:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Oct 2020 08:27:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-19"}

To\novercome this shortcoming, this paper proposes a Recurrent Learned Video\nCompression (RLVC) approach with the Recurrent Auto-Encoder (RAE) and Recurrent\nProbability Model (RPM). Specifically, the RAE employs recurrent cells in both\nthe encoder and decoder. As such, the temporal information in a large range of\nframes can be used for generating latent representations and reconstructing\ncompressed outputs. Furthermore, the proposed RPM network recurrently estimates\nthe Probability Mass Function (PMF) of the latent representation, conditioned\non the distribution of previous latent representations. Due to the correlation\namong consecutive frames, the conditional cross entropy can be lower than the\nindependent cross entropy, thus reducing the bit-rate.

By encoding content via maximum distance\nseparable (MDS) codes, coded fragments can be collectively cached at small-cell\nbase stations (SBSs) to enhance caching efficiency. However, content popularity\nis usually time-varying and unknown in practice. As a result, cache contents\nare anticipated to be intelligently updated by taking into account limited\ncaching storage and interactive impacts among SBSs. In response to these\nchallenges, we propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL)\nframework to intelligently update cache contents in dynamic environments. With\nthe goal of minimizing long-term expected fronthaul traffic loads, we first\nmodel dynamic coded caching as a cooperative multi-agent Markov decision\nprocess. Owing to MDS coding, the resulting decision-making falls into a class\nof constrained reinforcement learning problems with continuous decision\nvariables. To deal with this difficulty, we custom-build a novel DRL algorithm\nby embedding homotopy optimization into a deep deterministic policy gradient\nformalism. Next, to empower the caching framework with an effective trade-off\nbetween complexity and performance, we propose centralized, partially and fully\ndecentralized caching controls by applying the derived DRL approach.

We also note that the X-ray flux and spectral\nslope for ESO 121-G6 have significantly changed over the last decade,\nindicating significant changes in the obscuration and potentially accretion\nrate. On the other hand, NGC 3486 and NGC 5195 appear to be unobscured and just\nmildly obscured, respectively, with $L_{\\rm 2-10\\ keV,\\ int} <$ 10$^{39}$ erg\ns$^{-1}$; i.e., genuine LLAGN. Both of the heavily obscured AGN have $L_{\\rm\nbol} >$ 10$^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and $\\lambda_{\\rm Edd} \\gtrsim$ 10$^{-3}$, and\nare detected in high angular resolution mid-IR imaging, indicating the presence\nof obscuring dust on nuclear scale.

Like finding paths between pairs of\nlocations, circuit routing generates traces of wires to connect contacts or\nleads of circuit components. It is challenging because finding paths between\ndense and massive electronic components involves a very large search space.\nExisting solutions are either manually designed with domain knowledge or\ntailored to specific design rules, hence, difficult to adapt to new problems or\ndesign needs. Therefore, a general routing approach is highly desired. In this\npaper, we model the circuit routing as a sequential decision-making problem,\nand solve it by Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) with deep neural network (DNN)\nguided rollout. It could be easily extended to routing cases with more routing\nconstraints and optimization goals.

The difference between these\napproaches is the amount of memory required to compute or estimate the\nprobability of success as well as the kind of reinforcement learning\nrepresentation where they could be used. In this regard, we use the\nmemory-based approach as a baseline since it is obtained directly from the\nagent's observations. When comparing the learning-based and the\nintrospection-based approaches to this baseline, both are found to be suitable\nalternatives to compute the probability of success, obtaining high levels of\nsimilarity when compared using both the Pearson's correlation and the mean\nsquared error.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jun 2020 10:51:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2020 05:47:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 2 Sep 2021 07:17:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-03"}

Under variation of the\nlong-range hoppings governed by a decay exponent $\\mu$, we find an energy gap\nin the molecular band structure closes at a critical value $\\mu_c$ of the decay\nexponent and reopens for $\\mu$ deviating from $\\mu_c$. The relevant bulk bands\nin a pumping cycle acquire different Chern numbers in the strong ($\\mu<\\mu_c$)\nand weak ($\\mu>\\mu_c$) long-range hopping regimes, with a sudden jump at\ncriticality. This topological phase transition is also shown to separate two\ndistinct behaviors of the midgap end states in the pumping process. The end\nstates carry quantized current pumped by the rotating electric field and the\ncurrent forms a plateau by sweeping the Fermi energy over the gap. In the\nstrong hopping phase, the quantized current plateau is positive, which is\nreversed to a negative one with smaller amplitude in the weak hopping phase.\nHowever, the reversal is a smooth crossover, not a sharp transition, due to the\nfinite sizes of the molecules. We show that these transport characteristics of\nthe topological phase transition could also be observed at finite temperatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jun 2020 11:49:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-14"}

From a computational point of view, the three\nmeasures have in common that their crucial component is the diagonal of the\ngraph Laplacian's pseudoinverse, $L^\\dagger$. Computing diag$(L^\\dagger)$\nexactly by pseudoinversion, however, is as expensive as dense matrix\nmultiplication -- and the standard tools in practice even require cubic time.\nMoreover, the pseudoinverse requires quadratic space -- hardly feasible for\nlarge graphs. Resorting to approximation by, e.g., using the\nJohnson-Lindenstrauss transform, requires the solution of $O(\\log |V| /\n\\epsilon^2)$ Laplacian linear systems to guarantee a relative error, which is\nstill very expensive for large inputs.\n  In this paper, we present a novel approximation algorithm that requires the\nsolution of only one Laplacian linear system.

Studying the time-varying\nrelationships between items is crucial for educational assessment or designing\nmarketing strategies from survey questions. Although dynamic network models\nhave been widely developed, we cannot apply them directly to item response data\nbecause there are multiple systems of nodes with various types of local\ninteractions among items, resulting in multiplex network structures. We propose\na new model to study these temporal interactions among items by embedding the\nfunctional parameters within the exponential random graph model framework.\nInference on such models is difficult because the likelihood functions contain\nintractable normalizing constants. Furthermore, the number of functional\nparameters grows exponentially as the number of items increases. Variable\nselection for such models is not trivial because standard shrinkage approaches\ndo not consider temporal trends in functional parameters. To overcome these\nchallenges, we develop a novel Bayes approach by combining an auxiliary\nvariable MCMC algorithm and a recently-developed functional shrinkage method.\nWe apply our algorithm to survey and review data sets, illustrating that the\nproposed approach can avoid the evaluation of intractable normalizing constants\nas well as the detection of significant temporal interactions among items.\nThrough a simulation study under different scenarios, we examine the\nperformance of our algorithm.

In recent work, however, Kleinberg and Raghavan showed that, in the\npresence of implicit bias in estimating candidates' quality, the Rooney rule\ncan increase the utility of the selection process.\n  We argue that even in the absence of implicit bias, the estimates of\ncandidates' quality from different groups may differ in another fundamental\nway, namely, in their variance. We term this phenomenon implicit variance and\nwe ask: can fairness mechanisms be beneficial to the utility of a selection\nprocess in the presence of implicit variance (even in the absence of implicit\nbias)? To answer this question, we propose a simple model in which candidates\nhave a true latent quality that is drawn from a group-independent normal\ndistribution. To make the selection, a decision maker receives an unbiased\nestimate of the quality of each candidate, with normal noise, but whose\nvariance depends on the candidate's group.

Since neural networks are non-convex, more and more\nworks study the dynamic behavior of SGD and the impact to its generalization,\nespecially the escaping efficiency from local minima. However, these works take\nthe over-simplified assumption that the covariance of the noise in SGD is (or\ncan be upper bounded by) constant, although it is actually state-dependent. In\nthis work, we conduct a formal study on the dynamic behavior of SGD with\nstate-dependent noise. Specifically, we show that the covariance of the noise\nof SGD in the local region of the local minima is a quadratic function of the\nstate. Thus, we propose a novel power-law dynamic with state-dependent\ndiffusion to approximate the dynamic of SGD. We prove that, power-law dynamic\ncan escape from sharp minima exponentially faster than flat minima, while the\nprevious dynamics can only escape sharp minima polynomially faster than flat\nminima. Our experiments well verified our theoretical results. Inspired by our\ntheory, we propose to add additional state-dependent noise into (large-batch)\nSGD to further improve its generalization ability. Experiments verify that our\nmethod is effective.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jun 2020 13:34:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 2020 04:13:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 12 Oct 2020 11:40:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-13"}

Obfuscated gradients have previously been\nfound to exist in many defense methods and cause a false signal of robustness.\nIn this paper, we identify a more subtle situation called Imbalanced Gradients\nthat can also cause overestimated adversarial robustness. The phenomenon of\nimbalanced gradients occurs when the gradient of one term of the margin loss\ndominates and pushes the attack towards to a suboptimal direction. To exploit\nimbalanced gradients, we formulate a Margin Decomposition (MD) attack that\ndecomposes a margin loss into individual terms and then explores the\nattackability of these terms separately via a two-stage process. We also\npropose a multi-targeted and ensemble version of our MD attack. By\ninvestigating 24 defense models proposed since 2018, we find that 11 models are\nsusceptible to a certain degree of imbalanced gradients and our MD attack can\ndecrease their robustness evaluated by the best standalone baseline attack by\nmore than 1%.

This has been well\nstudied in encounters between a star--planet pair and a single star. Here we\nexplore the application of the exchange mechanism to a planet--satellite pair\nand another planet in the gravitational potential of a central star. As a case\nstudy, we focus on encounters between a satellite-bearing object and Neptune.\nWe investigate whether Neptune can capture satellites from that object and if\nthe captured satellites have orbits analogous to the Neptunian moons Triton and\nNereid. Using $N$-body simulations, we study the capture probability at\ndifferent encounter distances. Post-capture, we use a simple analytical\nargument to estimate how the captured orbits evolve under collisional and tidal\neffects. We find that the average capture probability reaches $\\sim$$10\\%$ if\nNeptune penetrates the donor planet's satellite system. Most moons grabbed by\nNeptune acquire highly eccentric orbits. Post-capture, around half of those\ncaptured, especially those on tight orbits, can be circularised, either by\ntides only or by collisions+tides, turning into Triton-like objects. Captures\nfurther out, on the other hand, stay on wide and eccentric orbits like that of\nNereid. Both moon types can be captured in the same encounter and they have\nwide distributions in orbital inclination. Therefore, Triton naturally has a\n$\\sim$50\\% chance of being retrograde. A similar process potentially applies to\nan exoplanetary system, and our model predicts that exomoons can jump from one\nplanet to another during planetary scattering. Specifically, there should be\ntwo distinct populations of captured moons: one on close-in circular orbits and\nthe other on far-out eccentric orbits. The two populations may have highly\ninclined prograde or retrograde orbits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jun 2020 14:04:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

In this study, we present microscopic calculations based on\nexcitonic Heisenberg equations of motion and identify the coupling of optically\npumped excitons to exciton-exciton scattering continua as the leading mechanism\nresponsible for an optical power dependent linewidth broadening (EID) and\nsideband formation.

The ability of these models to explain their decisions is\nimportant for fostering clinical trust and facilitating clinical translation.\nFurthermore, for many problems in medicine there is a wealth of existing\nclinical knowledge to draw upon, which may be useful in generating\nexplanations, but it is not obvious how this knowledge can be encoded into DL\nmodels - most models are learnt either from scratch or using transfer learning\nfrom a different domain. In this paper we address both of these issues. We\npropose a novel DL framework for image-based classification based on a\nvariational autoencoder (VAE). The framework allows prediction of the output of\ninterest from the latent space of the autoencoder, as well as visualisation (in\nthe image domain) of the effects of crossing the decision boundary, thus\nenhancing the interpretability of the classifier. Our key contribution is that\nthe VAE disentangles the latent space based on `explanations' drawn from\nexisting clinical knowledge. The framework can predict outputs as well as\nexplanations for these outputs, and also raises the possibility of discovering\nnew biomarkers that are separate (or disentangled) from the existing knowledge.\nWe demonstrate our framework on the problem of predicting response of patients\nwith cardiomyopathy to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) from cine\ncardiac magnetic resonance images.

Mixed-type spatial pattern\nrecognition entails two central tasks: (1) spatial filtering, to distinguish\nsystematic patterns from random noises; and (2) spatial clustering, to group\nfiltered patterns into distinct defect types. Observing that spatial filtering\nis instrumental to high-quality mixed-type pattern recognition, we propose to\nuse a graph-theoretic method, called adjacency-clustering, which leverages\nspatial dependence among adjacent defective chips to effectively filter the raw\nwafer maps.

It follows that shear and bending linearly\ndecouple so that the solution of the overall flow problem can be obtained by\nlinear superposition of the contributions arising from these modes of\ndeformation. Additionally, we probe the effect of the membrane on the\nhydrodynamic drag acting on a nearby particle, finding that, in a certain range\nof parameters, translational motion near an elastic membrane with only\nenergetic resistance toward shear can, surprisingly, be sped up compared to\nbulk fluid.

Heterogeneous systems with multi-core CPUs and GPUs have become more\nand more promising recently due to the prevalence of GPUs in general-purpose\ndata-parallel applications. Due to the large computational cost of MF, we aim\nto improve the efficiency of SGD-based MF computation by utilizing the massive\nparallel processing power of heterogeneous multiprocessors. The main challenge\nin parallel SGD algorithms on heterogeneous CPU-GPU systems lies in the\ngranularity of the matrix division and the strategy to assign tasks. We design\na novel strategy to divide the matrix into a set of blocks by considering two\naspects. First, we observe that the matrix should be divided nonuniformly, and\nrelatively large blocks should be assigned to GPUs to saturate the computing\npower of GPUs. In addition to exploiting the characteristics of hardware, the\nworkloads assigned to two types of hardware should be balanced. Aiming at the\nfinal division strategy, we design a cost model tailored for our problem to\naccurately estimate the performance of hardware on different data sizes. A\ndynamic scheduling policy is also used to further balance workloads in\npractice.

The main result of the paper is the following: if G is a discrete\nelectorally flexible group then every Hausdorff locally compact\nshift-continuous topology on G with adjoined zero is either compact, or\ndiscrete. Also, we construct a non-discrete non-compact Hausdorff locally\ncompact shift-continuous topology on any discrete virtually cyclic group (and\nhence on a electorally stable group) G with adjoined zero.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2020 18:49:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-30"}

These maps are especially critical in times\nof crisis when decision makers need to rapidly design and enact\nagriculture-related policies and mitigation strategies, including providing\nhumanitarian assistance, dispersing targeted aid, or boosting productivity for\nfarmers. A major challenge for developing crop maps is that many regions do not\nhave readily accessible ground truth data on croplands necessary for training\nand validating predictive models, and field campaigns are not feasible for\ncollecting labels for rapid response.

One of the main difficulties in using edge features is that they are\noften handcrafted, hard to get, specific to a particular domain, and may\ncontain redundant information. In this work, we present a framework for\ncreating new edge features, applicable to any domain, via a combination of\nself-supervised and unsupervised learning. In addition to this, we use\nForman-Ricci curvature as an additional edge feature to encapsulate the local\ngeometry of the graph.
