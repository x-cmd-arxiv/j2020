We propose\nthis effect also accounts for the puzzling \"mass gap\" events (MG) newly\nreported by LIGO/Virgo, as distant, lensed NSBH events with $1<z<4$. The fitted\nmass of the neutron star member becomes $(1+z)\\times 1.4M_\\odot$, and is\ntherefore misclassified as a low mass black hole. In this way, we derive a\nredshift of $z\\simeq 3.5$ and $z\\simeq 1.0$ for two newly reported \"mass\nasymmetric\" events GW190412 \\& GW190814, by interpreting them as lensed NSBH\nevents, comprising a stellar mass black hole and neutron star. Over the past\nyear an additional 31 BBH events and 5 MG events have been reported with high\nprobability ($>95\\%$), from which we infer a factor $\\simeq 5$ higher intrinsic\nrate of NSBH events than BBH events, reflecting a higher proportion of neutron\nstars formed by early star formation. We predict a distinctive locus for lensed\nNSBH events in the observed binary mass plane, spanning $1<z<4$ with a narrow\nmass ratio, $q \\simeq 0.2$, that can be readily tested when the waveform data\nare unlocked. All such events may show disrupted NS emission and are worthy of\nprompt follow-up as the high lensing magnification means EM detections are not\nprohibitive despite the high redshifts that we predict. Such lensed NSBH events\nprovide an exciting prospect of directly charting the history of coalescing\nbinaries via the cosmological redshift of their waveforms, determined relative\nto the characteristic mass of the neutron star member.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jun 2020 17:25:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-25"}

Despite deep learning\napproaches have achieved promising performance for pairwise dense 3D shapes\nmatching, it is a great challenge to generalize those approaches for the\ntracking of 3D time-varying geometries. In this paper, we aim at handling the\nproblem of 3D tracking, which provides the tracking of the consecutive frames\nof 3D shapes. We propose a novel unsupervised 3D shape registration framework\nnamed DeepTracking-Net, which uses the deep neural networks (DNNs) as auxiliary\nfunctions to produce spatially and temporally continuous displacement fields\nfor 3D tracking of objects in a temporal order. Our key novelty is that we\npresent a novel temporal-aware correspondence descriptor (TCD) that captures\nspatio-temporal essence from consecutive 3D point cloud frames. Specifically,\nour DeepTracking-Net starts with optimizing a randomly initialized latent TCD.\nThe TCD is then decoded to regress a continuous flow (i.e. a displacement\nvector field) which assigns a motion vector to every point of time-varying 3D\nshapes.

We propose a new perspective of learnable activation function\nthrough formulating them with element-wise attention mechanism. In each network\nlayer, we devise an attention module which learns an element-wise, sign-based\nattention map for the pre-activation feature map. The attention map scales an\nelement based on its sign. Adding the attention module with a rectified linear\nunit (ReLU) results in an amplification of positive elements and a suppression\nof negative ones, both with learned, data-adaptive parameters. We coin the\nresulting activation function Attention-based Rectified Linear Unit (AReLU).\nThe attention module essentially learns an element-wise residue of the\nactivated part of the input, as ReLU can be viewed as an identity\ntransformation. This makes the network training more resistant to gradient\nvanishing. The learned attentive activation leads to well-focused activation of\nrelevant regions of a feature map. Through extensive evaluations, we show that\nAReLU significantly boosts the performance of most mainstream network\narchitectures with only two extra learnable parameters per layer introduced.\nNotably, AReLU facilitates fast network training under small learning rates,\nwhich makes it especially suited in the case of transfer learning and meta\nlearning.

Well-mixed water, ammonia and hydrogen\nsulfide to determine O, N and S elemental abundances, respectively, are too\ndeep to measure by any observation technique. However, a precise measurement of\nthe noble gases, He, Ne, Ar, Kr and Xe, together with their isotopic ratios,\nwould circumvent the need for determining the above elements. Only entry probes\nare capable of measuring the noble gases, but those measurements can be done at\nrelatively shallow pressure levels of 5-10 bars. Complementary observations\nfrom orbiter, especially the interior (gravity and magnetic field) and depth\nprofiles of water and ammonia, would greatly enhance the data set for\nconstraining the formation models. No new technology is required to carry out\nan orbiter-probe mission to either Uranus or Neptune in the next decade.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jun 2020 16:51:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-25"}

However, tumor\ngrowth is such a complicated process that it is difficult to stratify high-risk\nnodules from low-risk ones based on morphologic characteristics. On the other\nhand, recent deep learning studies using convolutional neural networks (CNNs)\nto predict the malignancy score of nodules, only provides clinicians with\nblack-box predictions. To this end, we propose a unified framework, named\nNodule Follow-Up Prediction Network (NoFoNet), which predicts the growth of\npulmonary nodules with high-quality visual appearances and accurate\nquantitative results, given any time interval from baseline observations. It is\nachieved by predicting future displacement field of each voxel with a WarpNet.\nA TextureNet is further developed to refine textural details of WarpNet\noutputs. We also introduce techniques including Temporal Encoding Module and\nWarp Segmentation Loss to encourage time-aware and shape-aware representation\nlearning. We build an in-house follow-up dataset from two medical centers to\nvalidate the effectiveness of the proposed method. NoFoNet significantly\noutperforms direct prediction by a U-Net in terms of visual quality; more\nimportantly, it demonstrates accurate differentiating performance between high-\nand low-risk nodules. Our promising results suggest the potentials in computer\naided intervention for lung nodule management.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jun 2020 17:18:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Oct 2020 04:27:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-12"}

An analysis of the FUGIN 12CO(1-0) and\n13CO(1-0) line data confirms the existence of the filament traced in a velocity\nrange of [-5, +1] km/s.

A massive young stellar object\n(YSO) is embedded in IC 446, while IC 447 contains several massive B-type\nstars. The Herschel temperature map reveals the extended warm dust emission (at\nT_d ~ 15-21 K) toward both the ends of the filament. The Spitzer ratio map of\n4.5 micron/3.6 micron emission suggests the presence of photo-dissociation\nregions and signature of outflow activity toward IC 446 and IC 447. Based on\nthe photometric analysis of point-like sources, clusters of YSOs are traced\nmainly toward the filament ends.

We find that the CGM in these simulations is generally multiphase and\ndynamic, with a wide spectrum of largely nonlinear density perturbations\nsourced by the accretion of gas from the Inter-Galactic Medium (IGM) and\noutflows from both the central and satellite galaxies. We investigate the\norigin of the multiphase structure of the CGM with a particle tracking analysis\nand find that most of the low entropy gas has cooled from the hot halo as a\nresult of thermal instability triggered by these perturbations.

CASTLE will be able to reach surface brightness\norders of magnitude fainter than the sky background level and observe the\nextremely extended and faint features around galaxies such as tidal features,\nstellar halos, intra-cluster light, etc. CASTLE will also be used to search and\ndetect astrophysical transients such as gamma ray bursts (GRB), gravitational\nwave optical counterparts, neutrino counterparts, etc. This will increase the\nnumber of precisely localized GRBs from 20% to 60% (in the case of Fermi/GMB\nGRBs).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jun 2020 18:00:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-26"}

However, the effect of multiplicity is not sufficiently\nunderstood, resulting in a plethora of uncertainties about the end stages of\nmassive-star evolution. In order to investigate these uncertainties, it is\nuseful to study massive stars just before their demise. Classical Wolf-Rayet\nstars represent the final end stages of stars at the upper-mass end. The\nmultiplicity fraction of these stars was reported to be ${\\sim}0.4$ in the\nGalaxy but no correction for observational biases has been attempted.\n  The aim of this study is to conduct a homogeneous radial-velocity survey of a\nmagnitude-limited ($V$ $\\leq 12$) sample of Galactic Wolf-Rayet stars to derive\ntheir bias-corrected multiplicity properties. The present paper focuses on 12\nnorthern Galactic carbon-rich (WC) Wolf-Rayet stars observable with the 1.2m\nMercator telescope on the island of La Palma.\n  We homogeneously measured relative radial velocities (RVs) for carbon-rich\nWolf-Rayet stars using cross-correlation. Variations in the derived RVs were\nused to flag binary candidates. We investigated probable orbital configurations\nand provide a first correction of observational biases through Monte-Carlo\nsimulations.\n  Of the 12 northern Galactic WC stars in our sample, seven show peak-to-peak\nRV variations larger than 10 km s$^{-1}$, which we adopt as our detection\nthreshold. This results in an observed spectroscopic multiplicity fraction of\n0.58 with a binomial error of 0.14. In our campaign, we find a clear lack of\nshort-period (P~$<~\\sim$100\\,d), indicating that a large number of Galactic WC\nbinaries likely reside in long-period systems. Finally, our simulations show\nthat at the 10% significance level, the intrinsic multiplicity fraction of the\nGalactic WC population is at least 0.72.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jun 2020 18:00:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-02"}

Since their\nenergy density needs to rapidly redshift away, we explore decays to massless\nfields around the era of matter-radiation equality. We highlight a concrete\nimplementation of ultralight pseudo-scalars, axions, that decay to an abelian\ndark sector. This scenario circumvents major problems of other popular\nrealizations of early universe scalar models in that it uses a regular scalar\npotential that is quadratic around the minimum, instead of the extreme\nfine-tuning of many existing models. The idea is that the scalar is initially\nfrozen in its potential until $H\\sim m$, then efficient energy transfer from\nthe scalar to the massless field can occur shortly after the beginning of\noscillations due to resonance. We introduce an effective fluid model which\ncaptures the transition from the frozen scalar phase to the radiation dark\nsector phase. We perform a fit to a combined Planck 2018, BAO, SH$_0$ES and\nPantheon supernovae dataset and find that the model gives\n$H_0=69.9_{-0.86}^{+0.84}$ km/s/Mpc with $\\Delta\\chi^2 \\approx -9$ compared to\n$\\Lambda$CDM; while inclusions of other data sets may worsen the fit.\nImportantly, we find that large values of the coupling between fields is\nrequired for sufficiently rapid decay: For axion-gauge field models $\\phi\nF\\tilde{F}/\\Lambda$ it requires $\\Lambda\\lesssim f/80$, where $2\\pi f$ is the\nfield range.

The apparent inconsistency of the\nprompt emission spectra with the synchrotron radiation scenario has resulted in\nconsidering more complex models. The inclusion of the soft X-ray data (down to\n0.5 keV) in GRB spectra have led to the discovery of low-energy breaks in their\nspectra.

We demonstrate that when the halo mass crosses\n~10^12 M_sun, the cooling time of shocked gas in the inner CGM (~0.1 R_vir,\nwhere R_vir is the virial radius) exceeds the local free-fall time.

This transition occurs when the outer CGM (~0.5 R_vir) is already\nsubsonic and has a temperature ~T_vir, indicating that the longer cooling times\nat large radii allow the outer CGM to virialize at lower halo masses than the\ninner CGM. This outside-in CGM virialization scenario is in contrast with\ninside-out scenarios commonly envisioned based on more idealized simulations.\nWe demonstrate that inner CGM virialization coincides with abrupt changes in\nthe central galaxy and its stellar feedback: the galaxy settles into a stable\nrotating disc, star formation transitions from `bursty' to `steady,' and\nstellar-driven galaxy-scale outflows are suppressed.

Using power-law scaling relations\nbetween different physical parameters, we build an analytical model to connect\nthe observed X-ray emission to the magnetic flux. The basis for our model are\nthe scaling laws of Rosner, Tucker \\& Vaiana (RTV) that connect the temperature\nand pressure of a coronal loop to its length and energy input. To estimate the\nenergy flux into the upper atmosphere, we use scalings derived for different\nheating mechanisms, e.g. for field-line braiding or Alfven-wave heating. We\nsupplement this by observed relations between active region size and magnetic\nflux and derive scalings of how X-ray emissivity depends on temperature. Based\non our analytical model, we find a power-law dependence of the X-ray emission\non the magnetic flux, $L_{\\rm X}\\propto \\Phi^m$, with a power-law index $m$\nbeing in the range from about 1 to 2. This finding is consistent with a wide\nrange of observations, from individual features on the Sun, e.g. bright points\nor active regions, to stars of different types and varying levels of activity.\nThe power-law index $m$ depends on the choice of the heating mechanism, and our\nresults slightly favour the braiding and nanoflare scenarios over Alfv\\'en wave\nheating. In addition, the choice of instrument will have an impact on the\npower-law index $m$, which is because of the sensitivity of the observed\nwavelength region to the temperature of the coronal plasma. Overall, our simple\nanalytical model based on the RTV scaling laws gives a good representation of\nthe observed X-ray emission. This underlines that we might be able to\nunderstand stellar coronal activity though a collection of basic building\nblocks, i.e. loops, that we can study in spatially resolved detail on the Sun.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jun 2020 18:24:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

This phenomenon is of particular interest for\nunderstanding the evolution and population of small bodies, and for making\npredictions for future encounters. Previous numerical explorations typically\nused methods that do not adequately represent the nature of rubble piles. The\nencounter outcomes and influence factors are still poorly constrained. Based on\nrecent advances in modeling rubble piles, we aim to provide a better\nunderstanding of the tidal encounter processes through soft-sphere discrete\nelement modeling (SSDEM) and to establish a database of encounter outcomes and\nthe dependencies on encounter conditions and rubble-pile properties. We\nperformed thousands of numerical simulations using the SSDEM implemented in the\nN-body code pkdgrav to study the dynamical evolution of rubble piles during\nclose encounters with the Earth. The effects of encounter conditions, material\nstrength, arrangement, and resolution of constituent particles are explored.\nThree typical tidal encounter outcomes are classified, i.e., deformation, mass\nshedding, and disruption, ranging from mild modifications to severe damages of\nthe progenitor. The encounter speed and distance required for causing\ndisruption events are much smaller than those predicted by previous studies,\nindicating a smaller creation rate of tidally disrupted small body populations.\nExtremely elongated fragments with axis ratios ~1:6 can be formed by moderate\nencounters. Our analyses of the spin-shape evolution of the largest remnants\nreveal reshaping mechanisms of rubble piles in response to tidal forces,\nconsistent with stable rubble-pile configurations derived by continuum theory.\nA case study for SL9 suggests a low bulk density (0.2-0.3 g/cc) for its\nprogenitor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jun 2020 20:29:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

Given an infinite-horizon cost\nfunction, the so-called critic of RL approximates it with a neural net and\nsends this information to the controller (called \"actor\"). However, the issue\nof closed-loop stability under an RL-method is still not fully addressed. Since\nthe critic delivers merely an approximation to the value function of the\ncorresponding infinite-horizon problem, no guarantee can be given in general as\nto whether the actor's actions stabilize the system. Different approaches to\nthis issue exist. The current work offers a particular one, which, starting\nwith a (not necessarily smooth) control Lyapunov function (CLF), derives an\nonline RL-scheme in such a way that practical semi-global stability property of\nthe closed-loop can be established. The approach logically continues the work\nof the authors on parameterized controllers and Lyapunov-like constraints for\nRL, whereas the CLF now appears merely in one of the constraints of the control\nscheme.

Despite its\nintrinsic value for quantum computing, the widespread use of magic state\ndistillation, which is closely related to this model, emphasizes the importance\nof comprehending the hierarchy. There is currently a limited understanding of\nthe structure of this hierarchy, apart from the case of diagonal unitaries (Cui\net al., 2017; Rengaswamy et al. 2019). We explore the structure of the second\nand third levels of the hierarchy, the first level being the ubiquitous Pauli\ngroup, via the Weyl (i.e., Pauli) expansion of unitaries at these levels. In\nparticular, we characterize the support of the standard Clifford operations on\nthe Pauli group. Since conjugation of a Pauli by a third level unitary produces\ntraceless Hermitian Cliffords, we characterize their Pauli support as well.\nSemi-Clifford unitaries are known to have ancilla savings in the teleportation\nmodel, and we explore their Pauli support via symplectic transvections.\nFinally, we show that, up to multiplication by a Clifford, every third level\nunitary commutes with at least one Pauli matrix. This can be used inductively\nto show that, up to a multiplication by a Clifford, every third level unitary\nis supported on a maximal commutative subgroup of the Pauli group.\nAdditionally, it can be easily seen that the latter implies the generalized\nsemi-Clifford conjecture, proven by Beigi and Shor (2010).

Many measures of partisan bias\nare satisfactory for states that are balanced with roughly equal proportions of\nvoters for the two major parties. It has been less clear which metrics measure\nfairness robustly when the proportion of the vote is unbalanced by as little as\n60% to 40%. We have addressed this by analyzing past election results for four\nstates with Democratic preferences (CA, IL, MA, and MD), three states with\nRepublican preferences (SC, TN, and TX) and comparing those to results for four\nnearly balanced states (CO, NC, OH, and PA). We used many past statewide\nelections in each state to build statistically precise seats for votes and rank\nfor votes graphs to which many measures of partisan bias were applied. In\naddition to providing values of responsiveness, we find that five of the\nmeasures of bias provide mutually consistent values in all states, thereby\nproviding a core of usable measures for unbalanced states. Although all five\nmeasures focus on different aspects of partisan bias, normalization of the\nvalues across the eleven states provides a suitable way to compare them, and we\npropose that their average provides a superior measure which we call composite\nbias. Regarding other measures, we find that the most seemingly plausible\nsymmetry measure fails for unbalanced states. We also consider deviations from\nthe proportionality ideal, but using it is difficult because the political\ngeography of a state can entangle responsiveness with total partisan bias. We\ndo not attempt to separate intentional partisan bias from the implicit bias\nthat results from the interaction of the map drawing rules of a state and its\npolitical geography, on the grounds that redistricting should attempt to\nminimize total partisan bias whatever its provenance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jun 2020 21:43:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 20 Sep 2020 23:10:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 27 Sep 2020 22:57:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-29"}

This\nis often formulated as a minimum norm interpolation problem, regularized\nlearning problem or, in general, a semi-discrete inverse problem, in certain\nfunctional spaces. The choice of an appropriate space is crucial for solutions\nof these problems. Motivated by sparse representations of the reconstructed\nfunctions such as compressed sensing and sparse learning, much of the recent\nresearch interest has been directed to considering these problems in certain\nBanach spaces in order to obtain their sparse solutions, which is a feasible\napproach to overcome challenges coming from the big data nature of most\npractical applications. It is the goal of this paper to provide a systematic\nstudy of the representer theorems for these problems in Banach spaces. There\nare a few existing results for these problems in a Banach space, with all of\nthem regarding implicit representer theorems. We aim at obtaining explicit\nrepresenter theorems based on which convenient solution methods will then be\ndeveloped. For the minimum norm interpolation, the explicit representer\ntheorems enable us to express the infimum in terms of the norm of the linear\ncombination of the interpolation functionals. For the purpose of developing\nefficient computational algorithms, we establish the fixed-point equation\nformulation of solutions of these problems. We reveal that unlike in a Hilbert\nspace, in general, solutions of these problems in a Banach space may not be\nable to be reduced to truly finite dimensional problems (with certain infinite\ndimensional components hidden). We demonstrate how this obstacle can be\nremoved, reducing the original problem to a truly finite dimensional one, in\nthe special case when the Banach space is $\\ell_1(\\mathbb{N})$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jun 2020 23:37:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-26"}

However,\ngeneralizability of human pose estimation models developed using supervision on\nlarge-scale in-studio datasets remains questionable, as these models often\nperform unsatisfactorily on unseen in-the-wild environments. Though\nweakly-supervised models have been proposed to address this shortcoming,\nperformance of such models relies on availability of paired supervision on some\nrelated tasks, such as 2D pose or multi-view image pairs. In contrast, we\npropose a novel kinematic-structure-preserved unsupervised 3D pose estimation\nframework, which is not restrained by any paired or unpaired weak supervisions.\nOur pose estimation framework relies on a minimal set of prior knowledge that\ndefines the underlying kinematic 3D structure, such as skeletal joint\nconnectivity information with bone-length ratios in a fixed canonical scale.\nThe proposed model employs three consecutive differentiable transformations\nnamed as forward-kinematics, camera-projection and spatial-map transformation.\nThis design not only acts as a suitable bottleneck stimulating effective pose\ndisentanglement but also yields interpretable latent pose representations\navoiding training of an explicit latent embedding to pose mapper. Furthermore,\ndevoid of unstable adversarial setup, we re-utilize the decoder to formalize an\nenergy-based loss, which enables us to learn from in-the-wild videos, beyond\nlaboratory settings.

While many studies have attempted to measure road\naccessibility (either in the scope of evacuation or beyond), few have\nconsidered both dynamic evacuation demand and characteristics of a hurricane.\nThis study proposes a methodological framework to achieve this goal. In an\ninterval of every six hours, the method first estimates the evacuation demand\nin terms of number of vehicles per household in each county subdivision by\nconsidering the hurricane's wind radius and track. The closest facility\nanalysis is then employed to model evacuees' route choices towards the\npredefined evacuation destinations. The potential crowdedness index (PCI), a\nmetric capturing the level of crowdedness of each road segment, is then\ncomputed by coupling the estimated evacuation demand and route choices.\nFinally, the road accessibility of each sub-county is measured by calculating\nthe reciprocal of the sum of PCI values of corresponding roads connecting\nevacuees from the sub-county to the designated destinations. The method is\napplied to the entire state of Florida during Hurricane Irma in September 2017.\nResults show that I-75 and I-95 northbound have a high level of congestion, and\nsub-counties along the northbound I-95 suffer from the worst road\naccessibility. In addition, this research performs a sensitivity analysis for\nexamining the impacts of different choices of behavioral response curves on\naccessibility results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jun 2020 02:17:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-26"}

We explore\ncosmological solutions for a flat, homogeneous and isotropic universe; and we\nassume the late future time behavior when the dark energy dominates the cosmic\nevolution. When modeled as a perfect fluid with a dynamical equation of state,\n$p=w(a)\\rho$, the dark energy has an energy density, temperature and entropy\nwell defined and an interesting result is that there is no entropy production\neven though been dynamical. For dissipative dark energy, in the Eckart theory\ntwo cases are studied: $\\xi=const.$ and $\\xi =(\\beta/\\sqrt{3}) \\rho^{1/2}$; it\nis found that the entropy grows exponentially for the first case and as a\npower-law for the second. In the Israel-Stewart theory we consider a $\\xi\n=\\xi_0 \\rho^{1/2}$ and a relaxation time $\\tau = \\xi/\\rho$; an analytical Big\nRip solution is obtained with a power-law entropy. In all cases a power-law\nrelation between temperature and energy density is obtained. In order to\nmaintain the second law of thermodynamics theoretical constraints for the\nequation of state are found in the different dark energy models studied. A\nbarotropic dark fluid with $w<-1$ is thermodynamically difficult to support,\nbut the overall effect of bulk viscosity in certain cases allows a phantom\nregime without thermodynamic anomalies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jun 2020 03:22:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Mar 2022 21:26:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-03"}

However, for continuous gauge groups, Hamiltonian-based\nformulations involve infinite-dimensional gauge degrees of freedom that can\nsolely be handled by truncation. Current truncation schemes require\ndramatically increasing computational resources at small values of the bare\ncouplings, where magnetic field effects become important. Such limitation\nprecludes one from `taking the continuous limit' while working with finite\nresources. To overcome this limitation, we provide a resource-efficient\nprotocol to simulate LGTs with continuous gauge groups in the Hamiltonian\nformulation.

Recent\nwork demonstrated a novel mechanism whereby recurrent spiking networks could\nefficiently encode dynamic stimuli, achieving a superclassical scaling in which\ncoding errors decrease as $1/N$.

We propose a subspace framework that\nperforms two-sided or one-sided projections on the state-space representation\nof $H(\\cdot)$, commonly employed in model reduction and giving rise to a\nreduced transfer function. At every iteration, the projection subspaces are\nexpanded to attain Hermite interpolation conditions at the eigenvalues of the\nreduced transfer function closest to the target, which in turn leads to a new\nreduced transfer function. We prove in theory that, when a sequence of\neigenvalues of the reduced transfer functions converges to an eigenvalue of the\nfull problem, it converges at least at a quadratic rate. In the second part, we\nextend the proposed framework to locate the eigenvalues of a general square\nlarge-scale nonlinear meromorphic matrix-valued function $T(\\cdot)$, where we\nexploit a representation $\\mathcal{R}(s) = C(s) A(s)^{-1} B(s) - D(s)$ defined\nin terms of the block components of $T(\\cdot)$.

Due to\nthe fact that each sensor node has a limited FoV, the commonly adopted fusion\nmethods become unreliable. In fact, the monitored area of multiple sensor nodes\nconsists of several parts that are either exclusive of a single node, i.e.\nexclusive FoVs (eFoVs) or common to multiple (at least two) nodes, i.e. common\nFoVs (cFoVs).

In linear stage, EPs induce evident mode structure and\nfrequency shifts; meanwhile, RSAE saturates by radial decoupling with resonant\nEPs due to weak magnetic shear, and gives rise to global EP convective\ntransport and non-adiabatic frequency chirping. The spatiotemporal scales of\nphase space wave-EP interactions are characterized by the perpendicular\nwavelength and wave-particle trapping time. The simulations provide insights\ninto general as well as specific features of RSAE spectra and EP transport from\nexperimental observations, and illustrate the fundamental physics of wave-EP\nresonant interaction with the interplay of magnetic geometry, plasma\nnon-uniformity and non-perturbative EPs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jun 2020 08:17:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-28"}

For this framework, he establishes the conditions under which\npositive sorting between agents' attributes is the unique market outcome.\nBecker's celebrated sorting result has been applied to address many economic\nquestions. However, recent empirical studies in the fields of health,\nhousehold, and labor economics suggest that agents have multiple\noutcome-relevant attributes. In this paper, I study a matching model with\nmultidimensional types. I offer multidimensional generalizations of concordance\nand supermodularity to construct three multidimensional sorting patterns and\ntwo classes of multidimensional complementarities. For each of these sorting\npatterns, I identify the sufficient conditions which guarantee its optimality.\nIn practice, we observe sorting patterns between observed attributes that are\naggregated over unobserved characteristics. To reconcile theory with practice,\nI establish the link between production complementarities and the aggregated\nsorting patterns. Finally, I examine the relationship between agents' health\nstatus and their spouses' education levels among U.S. households within the\nframework for multidimensional matching markets. Preliminary analysis reveals a\nweak positive association between agents' health status and their spouses'\neducation levels. This weak positive association is estimated to be a product\nof three factors: (a) an attraction between better-educated individuals, (b) an\nattraction between healthier individuals, and (c) a weak positive association\nbetween agents' health status and their education levels. The attraction\nchannel suggests that the insurance risk associated with a two-person family\nplan is higher than the aggregate risk associated with two individual policies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jun 2020 08:19:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-26"}

This is because they can\noften solve many SE challenges without enormous manual feature engineering\neffort and complex domain knowledge. Although many DL studies have reported\nsubstantial advantages over other state-of-the-art models on effectiveness,\nthey often ignore two factors: (1) replicability - whether the reported\nexperimental result can be approximately reproduced in high probability with\nthe same DL model and the same data; and (2) reproducibility - whether one\nreported experimental findings can be reproduced by new experiments with the\nsame experimental protocol and DL model, but different sampled real-world data.\nUnlike traditional machine learning (ML) models, DL studies commonly overlook\nthese two factors and declare them as minor threats or leave them for future\nwork. This is mainly due to high model complexity with many manually set\nparameters and the time-consuming optimization process. In this study, we\nconducted a literature review on 93 DL studies recently published in twenty SE\njournals or conferences. Our statistics show the urgency of investigating these\ntwo factors in SE.

It is therefore urgent\nfor the SE community to provide a long-lasting link to a replication package,\nenhance DL-based solution stability and convergence, and avoid performance\nsensitivity on different sampled data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jun 2020 08:20:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-23"}

We extend\nearlier studies that found the facular-to-sunspot-area ratio diminishes with\ntotal sunspot coverage. Chromospheric indices and the total magnetic flux\nenclosed in network and faculae, referred to here as 'facular indices', are\nmodulated by the amount of facular and network present. We probed the\nrelationship between various facular and sunspot indices through an empirical\nmodel that takes into account how active regions evolve. This model was\nincorporated into a total solar irradiance (TSI) model. The model presented\nhere replicates most of the observed variability in the facular indices, and is\nbetter at doing so than earlier models. Contrary to recent studies, we found\nthe relationship between the facular and sunspot indices to be stable over the\npast four decades. The model indicates that, like the facular-to-sunspot-area\nratio, the ratio of the variation in chromospheric emission and total network\nand facular magnetic flux to sunspot area decreases with the latter. The TSI\nmodel indicates the ratio of the TSI excess from faculae and network to the\ndeficit from sunspots also declines with sunspot area, with the consequence\nbeing that TSI rises with sunspot area more slowly than if the two quantities\nwere linearly proportional to one another. The extrapolation of the TSI model\nto higher activity levels indicates that in the activity range where Sun-like\nstars are observed to switch from growing brighter with increasing activity to\nbecoming dimmer instead, the activity-dependence of TSI exhibits a similar\ntransition as sunspot darkening starts to rise more rapidly with activity than\nfacular brightening. This bolsters the interpretation of this behavior of\nSun-like stars as the transition from a faculae-dominated to a spot-dominated\nregime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jun 2020 09:38:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 2020 12:09:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-06"}

However, lightweight arms undergo\nundesirable elastic deformation. In this paper, the planar motion of a\nlightweight flexible arm is investigated. In order to obtain a precise\nmathematical model, the axial displacement and nonlinear curvature of flexible\narm arising from large bending deformation is taken into consideration. An\nin-extensional condition, the axial displacement is related to transverse\ndisplacement of the flexible beam, is applied. This leads to a robotic model\nwith three rigid modes and one elastic mode. The elastic mode depends on time\nand position. An Assume Mode Method is used to remove the spatial dependence.\nThe governing equations is derived using Lagrange Method. The effects of\nnonlinear terms due to the large deformation, gravity, and tip-mass are\nconsidered. Control inputs include forces and moment exerted at the joint\nbetween slider and arm (see Fig. 1). The conventional computed torque control\nlaws cannot stabilize the system, since there are not as many control inputs as\nstates of the system. A Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) technique is then\nused to obtain a suitable trajectory with the aim of minimizing excitations of\nthe elastic mode. Two methods are considered for generating a trajectory\nfunction, either to use a three-layer Artificial Neural Network (ANN) or to use\nspline interpolation. A sliding mode control strategy is proposed in which the\nsliding surfaces include elastic mode in order to guarantee robustness. The\nsimulations show that the three-layer ANN technique provides arbitrary small\nsettling time, and also the optimization algorithm converges faster and\ngenerates smooth trajectories unlike spline function technique.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jun 2020 09:54:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-26"}

Phase uncertainty limits the precision of an\ninterferometric measurement. This measurement is also subject to quantum\nback-action, caused by the radiation pressure force fluctuations produced by\nthe amplitude uncertainty (QRPN). In order to lower this quantum noise, GW\ndetectors plan to use squeezed light injection. In this thesis, I focus on\nusing radiation-pressure-mediated optomechanical (OM) interaction to generate\nsqueezed light. Creating squeezed states by using OM interaction enables\nwavelength-independent squeezed light sources that may also be more compact and\nrobust than traditionally used non-linear crystals. We analyze the system with\nrealistic imperfections (losses & classical noise), and use the concepts to\ndesign an experiment to obtain the most possible squeezing in a broad\naudio-frequency band at room temperature. This involves an optimization for the\noptical properties of the cavity and the mechanical properties of the\noscillator. We then show its experimental implementation, and subsequent\nobservation of QRPN as well as OM squeezing. These are the first ever direct\nobservations of a room temperature oscillator's motion being overwhelmed by\nvacuum fluctuations. This is shown in the low frequency band, which is relevant\nto GW detectors, but poses its own technical challenges, and hence has not been\ndone before. Being in the back-action dominated regime along with optimized\noptical properties has also enabled us to observe OM squeezing. That is the\nfirst direct observation of quantum noise suppression in a room temperature OM\nsystem. It is also the first direct evidence of quantum correlations in the\naudio frequency band, in a broad band at non-resonant frequencies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jun 2020 11:56:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

Its mathematical core is the\ncausal action principle. In this thesis, we develop a formalism which connects\nthe causal action principle to a suitable notion of fields on space-time. We\nderive field equations from the causal action principle and find that the\ndynamics induced by the field equations conserve a symplectic form which gives\nrise to an Hamiltonian time evolution if the causal fermion system admits a\nnotion of time.

DVR only\nrequires computing stochastic gradients of the local functions, and is\ncomputationally as fast as a standard stochastic variance-reduced algorithms\nrun on a $1/n$ fraction of the dataset, where $n$ is the number of nodes. To\nderive DVR, we use Bregman coordinate descent on a well-chosen dual problem,\nand obtain a dual-free algorithm using a specific Bregman divergence. We give\nan accelerated version of DVR based on the Catalyst framework, and illustrate\nits effectiveness with simulations on real data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jun 2020 13:22:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-26"}

Various types of autoencoders have been proposed by introducing\nregularization terms. Most of these regularizations improve representation\nlearning by constraining the weights in the encoder part, which maps input into\nhidden nodes and affects the generation of features. In this study, we show\nthat a constraint to the decoder can also significantly improve its performance\nbecause the decoder determines how the latent variables contribute to the\nreconstruction of input. Inspired by the structural modal analysis method in\nmechanical engineering, a new modal autoencoder (MAE) is proposed by\nothogonalising the columns of the readout weight matrix. The new regularization\nhelps to disentangle explanatory factors of variation and forces the MAE to\nextract fundamental modes in data. The learned representations are functionally\nindependent in the reconstruction of input and perform better in consecutive\nclassification tasks. The results were validated on the MNIST variations and\nUSPS classification benchmark suite. Comparative experiments clearly show that\nthe new algorithm has a surprising advantage. The new MAE introduces a very\nsimple training principle for autoencoders and could be promising for the\npre-training of deep neural networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jun 2020 13:25:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-26"}

We introduce a probabilistic approach that partitions the spatial\ndomain into subregions and models the event arrivals in each region with\ninteracting point-processes. Our algorithm can jointly learn the spatial\npartitioning and the interaction between these regions through a gradient-based\noptimization procedure. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of our\nalgorithm on both simulated data and two real-life datasets. We compare our\napproach with baseline and state-of-the-art deep learning-based approaches,\nwhere we achieve significant performance improvements. Moreover, we also show\nthe effect of using different parameters on the overall performance through\nempirical results and explain the procedure for choosing the parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jun 2020 14:04:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Mar 2021 19:36:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-17"}

Recently, two attention methods\nare proposed via combining with Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) and Long Short-Term\nMemory (LSTM) network, which can capture the dependencies of sensing signals in\nboth spatial and temporal domains simultaneously. However, recurrent networks\noften have a weak feature representing power compared with convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs). On the other hand, two attention, i.e., hard attention and\nsoft attention, are applied in temporal domains via combining with CNN, which\npay more attention to the target activity from a long sequence. However, they\ncan only tell where to focus and miss channel information, which plays an\nimportant role in deciding what to focus. As a result, they fail to address the\nspatial-temporal dependencies of multimodal sensing signals, compared with\nattention-based GRU or LSTM. In the paper, we propose a novel dual attention\nmethod called DanHAR, which introduces the framework of blending channel\nattention and temporal attention on a CNN, demonstrating superiority in\nimproving the comprehensibility for multimodal HAR. Extensive experiments on\nfour public HAR datasets and weakly labeled dataset show that DanHAR achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance with negligible overhead of parameters.\nFurthermore, visualizing analysis is provided to show that our attention can\namplifies more important sensor modalities and timesteps during classification,\nwhich agrees well with human common intuition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jun 2020 14:17:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 07:54:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 20 Jul 2021 01:33:26 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 21 Jul 2021 08:21:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-22"}

Unfortunately, DL ontologies are difficult to learn from data and\ntime-consuming to encode manually. As a result, ontologies for broad domains\nare almost inevitably incomplete. In recent years, several data-driven\napproaches have been proposed for automatically extending such ontologies. One\nfamily of methods rely on characterizations of concepts that are derived from\ntext descriptions. While such characterizations do not capture ontological\nknowledge directly, they encode information about the similarity between\ndifferent concepts, which can be exploited for filling in the gaps in existing\nontologies.

The unmanned aerial vehicles\n(UAVs) can provide the low-cost and quick deployment, which can support\nhigh-quality line-of-sight communications and have become promising mobile BSs.\nIn this paper, we propose a quality-of-experience (QoE)-driven UAV-enabled\npseudo-analog wireless video broadcast scheme, which provides mobile video\nbroadcast services for ground users (GUs). Due to limited energy available in\nUAV, the aim of the proposed scheme is to maximize the minimum peak\nsignal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of GUs' video reconstruction quality by jointly\noptimizing the transmission power allocation strategy and the UAV trajectory.\nFirstly, the reconstructed video quality at GUs is defined under the\nconstraints of the UAV's total energy and motion mechanism, and the proposed\nscheme is formulated as a complex non-convex optimization problem. Then, the\noptimization problem is simplified to obtain a tractable suboptimal solution\nwith the help of the block coordinate descent model and the successive convex\napproximation model. Finally, the experimental results are presented to show\nthe effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

As a result, a cluster is softly characterized\nby a set of consistent pointers. This highly flexible approach can solve\nclustering problems in various setups, ranging from questionnaires over\ncommunity detection in graphs to clustering points in metric spaces. The output\nof our proposed framework is hierarchical and induces the notion of a soft\ndendrogram, which can help explore the cluster structure of a dataset. The\ncomputational complexity of aggregating the cuts is linear in the number of\ndata points. Thus the bottleneck of the tangle approach is to generate the\ncuts, for which simple and fast algorithms form a sufficient basis.

Current machine learning approaches fall well short of\nthese human standards, although different modeling traditions often have\ncomplementary strengths. Symbolic models can capture the compositional and\ncausal knowledge that enables flexible generalization, but they struggle to\nlearn from raw inputs, relying on strong abstractions and simplifying\nassumptions. Neural network models can learn directly from raw data, but they\nstruggle to capture compositional and causal structure and typically must\nretrain to tackle new tasks. We bring together these two traditions to learn\ngenerative models of concepts that capture rich compositional and causal\nstructure, while learning from raw data. We develop a generative neuro-symbolic\n(GNS) model of handwritten character concepts that uses the control flow of a\nprobabilistic program, coupled with symbolic stroke primitives and a symbolic\nimage renderer, to represent the causal and compositional processes by which\ncharacters are formed. The distributions of parts (strokes), and correlations\nbetween parts, are modeled with neural network subroutines, allowing the model\nto learn directly from raw data and express nonparametric statistical\nrelationships. We apply our model to the Omniglot challenge of human-level\nconcept learning, using a background set of alphabets to learn an expressive\nprior distribution over character drawings. In a subsequent evaluation, our GNS\nmodel uses probabilistic inference to learn rich conceptual representations\nfrom a single training image that generalize to 4 unique tasks, succeeding\nwhere previous work has fallen short.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jun 2020 14:41:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 23 Jan 2021 16:40:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-26"}

Random actuation\nerrors in the joint space usually prevent the two arms from reaching their\ndesired task space poses, which in turn results in a random error in relative\npose between the two hands. This random error varies from trial to trial, and\nthus depending on the tolerance between the peg and the hole, the outcome of\nthe assembly task may be random (sometimes the task execution succeeds and\nsometimes it fails). In general, since the relative pose has $6$\ndegrees-of-freedom, there are infinite numbers of joint space solutions for the\ntwo arms that correspond to the same task space relative pose. However, in the\npresence of actuation errors, the joint space solutions are not all identical\nsince they map the joint space error sets differently to the task space. Thus,\nthe goal of this paper is to develop a methodical approach to compute a joint\nspace solution such that the maximum task space error is below a (specified)\nthreshold with high probability. Such a solution is called a robust inverse\nkinematics solution for the bi-manual robot. Our proposed method also allows\nthe robot to self-evaluate whether it can perform a given bi-manual task\nreliably.

The effectiveness of\nspectral clustering stems from constructing a non-linear embedding based on\ncreating a similarity graph and computing the spectral decomposition of the\nLaplacian matrix. However, spectral clustering methods fail to scale to large\ndata sets because of high computational cost and memory usage. A popular\napproach for addressing these problems utilizes the Nystrom method, an\nefficient sampling-based algorithm for computing low-rank approximations to\nlarge positive semi-definite matrices. This paper demonstrates how the\npreviously popular approach of Nystrom-based spectral clustering has severe\nlimitations.

Also, current understanding is limited regarding how utilizing the\nNystrom approximation will affect the quality of spectral embedding\napproximations.

Since logic is a powerful tool to\nmodel problems, it has been used to obtain very general meta-theorems. In this\nwork, we consider all problems definable in first-order logic and analyze which\nproperties of complex networks allow them to be solved efficiently.\n  The mathematical tool to describe complex networks are random graph models.\nWe define a property of random graph models called\n$\\alpha$-power-law-boundedness. Roughly speaking, a random graph is\n$\\alpha$-power-law-bounded if it does not admit strong clustering and its\ndegree sequence is bounded by a power-law distribution with exponent at least\n$\\alpha$ (i.e. the fraction of vertices with degree $k$ is roughly\n$O(k^{-\\alpha})$).\n  We solve the first-order model-checking problem (parameterized by the length\nof the formula) in almost linear FPT time on random graph models satisfying\nthis property with $\\alpha \\ge 3$.

These systems rely on using beamforming codebooks for both\ninitial access and data transmission. Current beam codebooks, however,\ngenerally consist of a large number of narrow beams that scan all possible\ndirections, even if these directions are never used. This leads to very large\ntraining overhead. Further, these codebooks do not normally account for the\nhardware impairments or the possible non-uniform array geometries, and their\ncalibration is an expensive process. To overcome these limitations, this paper\ndevelops an efficient online machine learning framework that learns how to\nadapt the codebook beam patterns to the specific deployment, surrounding\nenvironment, user distribution, and hardware characteristics. This is done by\ndesigning a novel complex-valued neural network architecture in which the\nneuron weights directly model the beamforming weights of the analog phase\nshifters, accounting for the key hardware constraints such as the\nconstant-modulus and quantized-angles. This model learns the codebook beams\nthrough online and self-supervised training avoiding the need for explicit\nchannel state information. This respects the practical situations where the\nchannel is either unavailable, imperfect, or hard to obtain, especially in the\npresence of hardware impairments. Simulation results highlight the capability\nof the proposed solution in learning environment and hardware aware beam\ncodebooks, which can significantly reduce the training overhead, enhance the\nachievable data rates, and improve the robustness against possible hardware\nimpairments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jun 2020 15:50:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-26"}

In practice, programmers often utilize code comments to comprehend and\nreuse code, as comments carry important domain knowledge. But current code\ndetection techniques ignore code comments, mainly due to the ambiguity of the\nEnglish language. Recent advances in information retrieval techniques may have\nthe potential to utilize code comments for clone detection. We investigated\nthis by empirically comparing the accuracy of detecting clones with solely\ncomments versus solely source code (without comments) on the JHotDraw package,\nwhich contains 315 classes and 27K lines of code.

The measured\nvelocity of electron mass is always less than $c$ in any direction but charge\ncan be displaced at the speed of light. This speed is realizable only when the\nelectron is in a state that is a superposition of positive and negative energy\nstates, also known as a zitterbewegung state. It is shown that in\nzitterbewegung it is the charge and not the mass that undergoes rapid spatial\noscillation, and that there are measurable consequences of this charge\nzitterbewegung. Zitterbewegung of charge also occurs in an entangled\nelectron-positron pair created by a strong electric field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jun 2020 15:20:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-30"}

In this\nstudy, we analyzed 587 million tweets worldwide to see how global collaborative\nefforts in reducing human mobility are reflected from the user-generated\ninformation at the global, country, and the U.S. state scale. Considering the\nmultifaceted nature of mobility, we propose two types of distance: the\nsingle-day distance and the cross-day distance. To quantify the responsiveness\nin certain geographical regions, we further propose a mobility-based responsive\nindex (MRI) that captures the overall degree of mobility changes within a time\nwindow. The results suggest that mobility patterns obtained from Twitter data\nare amendable to quantitatively reflect the mobility dynamics. Globally, the\nproposed two distances had greatly deviated from their baselines after March\n11, 2020, when WHO declared COVID-19 as a pandemic. The considerably less\nperiodicity after the declaration suggests that the protection measures have\nobviously affected people's travel routines. The country scale comparisons\nreveal the discrepancies in responsiveness, evidenced by the contrasting\nmobility patterns in different epidemic phases. We find that the triggers of\nmobility changes correspond well with the national announcements of mitigation\nmeasures. In the U.S., the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on mobility is\ndistinct. However, the impacts varied substantially among states. The strong\nmobility recovering momentum is further fueled by the Black Lives Matter\nprotests, potentially fostering the second wave of infections in the U.S.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jun 2020 23:21:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-03"}

For\nthis reason, automated image segmentation is highly desired as clinical\ndecision support for quantitative assessment and disease monitoring.

The workshop aimed at gathering people across the board to\naddress seemingly contrasting challenges in the problems they are working on.\nAs part of the call for the workshop, particular attention has been given to\nthe interdependence of architecture, data, and optimization that gives rise to\nan enormous landscape of design and performance intricacies that are not\nwell-understood. This year, our goal was to emphasize the following directions\nin our community: (i) identify obstacles in the way to better models and\nalgorithms; (ii) identify the general trends from which we would like to build\nscientific and potentially theoretical understanding; and (iii) the rigorous\ndesign of scientific experiments and experimental protocols whose purpose is to\nresolve and pinpoint the origin of mysteries while ensuring reproducibility and\nrobustness of conclusions. In the event, these topics emerged and were broadly\ndiscussed, matching our expectations and paving the way for new studies in\nthese directions. While we acknowledge that the text is naturally biased as it\ncomes through our lens, here we present an attempt to do a fair job of\nhighlighting the outcome of the workshop.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jun 2020 12:19:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2020 13:22:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-30"}

However, the latest\nneuroscience has suggested brain network connectivity. Thus, the exhibited\ninteraction between EEG channels might not be appropriately measured via\nEuclidean distance. To fill the gap, an attention-based graph residual network,\na novel structure of Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCN), was presented to\ndetect human motor intents from raw EEG signals, where the topological\nstructure of EEG electrodes was built as a graph. Meanwhile, deep residual\nlearning with a full-attention architecture was introduced to address the\ndegradation problem concerning deeper networks in raw EEG motor imagery (MI)\ndata. Individual variability, the critical and longstanding challenge\nunderlying EEG signals, has been successfully handled with the state-of-the-art\nperformance, 98.08% accuracy at the subject level, 94.28% for 20 subjects.\nNumerical results were promising that the implementation of the\ngraph-structured topology was superior to decode raw EEG data. The innovative\ndeep learning approach was expected to entail a universal method towards both\nneuroscience research and real-world EEG-based practical applications, e.g.,\nseizure prediction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 25 Jun 2020 09:29:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-28"}
