We formulate a mathematical programming problem to compute the\noptimal GMM mechanism, quantify the upper limit of enforceable security\npolicies, and characterize conditions on user's identifiability and\nmanageability for cyber attribution and user management. We develop a\nseparation principle that decouples the design of the modulator from the GMM\nmechanism and an equivalence principle that turns the joint design of the\ngenerator and the manipulator into the single design of the manipulator. A case\nstudy of dynamic honeypot configurations is presented to mitigate insider\nthreats.

Among well-known avenues to address finite sum\nproblems is the class of incremental gradient (IG) methods where a single\ncomponent function is selected at each iteration in a cyclic or randomized\nmanner. When the problem is constrained, the existing IG schemes (including\nprojected IG, proximal IAG, and SAGA) require a projection step onto the\nfeasible set at each iteration. Consequently, the performance of these schemes\nis afflicted with costly projections when the problem includes: (1) nonlinear\nconstraints, or (2) a large number of linear constraints. Our focus in this\npaper lies in addressing both of these challenges. We develop an algorithm\ncalled averaged iteratively regularized incremental gradient (aIR-IG) that does\nnot involve any hard-to-project computation. Under mild assumptions, we derive\nnon-asymptotic rates of convergence for both suboptimality and infeasibility\nmetrics.

This work proposes a molecular dynamics (MD) analysis method that can\nexamine the role of dislocations, cooling rates, void, and their interactions\ngoverning the material properties and failure mechanism in Inconel-718 using\nEmbedded Atom Method (EAM) potential. Three different structures: nanowire\n(NW), nanopillar, and nanoplate are used throughout this work. Initially,\nstrain rates are varied from 10^8s^-1 to 10^10s^-1 keeping the NW diameter and\ntemperature constant at 3.17 nm and 300K respectively. Compressive loading is\napplied to a 7.04 nm nanopillar by applying a constant strain rate of 109 s^-1\nwhile temperature is varied from 100K to 700K. Different cooling rates ranging\nfrom 0.5x10^10 K/s to 1 x 10^14 K/s are applied to nanoplates (with and without\na central void). The size of the central void is kept fixed at 2.12 nm.\nIncreasing strain rates in tension not only results in strain hardening but\nalso increase in dislocation density. Our computational method is successful to\ncapture extensive sliding on {111} shear plane, which leads to significant\nnecking of the alloy before fracture due to dislocation.

Classification models for high-dimensional\ndata, like images, are often inherently complex. To reduce this complexity,\nindividual predictions may be explained locally, either in terms of a simpler\nlocal surrogate model or by communicating how the predictions contrast with\nthose of another class. However, existing approaches still fall short in the\nfollowing ways: a) they measure locality using a (Euclidean) metric that is not\nmeaningful for non-linear high-dimensional data; or b) they do not attempt to\nexplain the decision boundary, which is the most relevant characteristic of\nclassifiers that are optimized for classification accuracy; or c) they do not\ngive the user any freedom in specifying attributes that are meaningful to them.\nWe address these issues in a new procedure for local decision boundary\napproximation (DBA). To construct a meaningful metric, we train a variational\nautoencoder to learn a Euclidean latent space of encoded data representations.\nWe impose interpretability by exploiting attribute annotations to map the\nlatent space to attributes that are meaningful to the user.

To do so, we introduce models\nconsisting of a first-stage \\textit{fixed} image transform followed by a\nsecond-stage \\textit{learnable} convolutional neural network, and we varied the\nfirst stage component. The primary model has a foveated-textural input stage,\nwhich we compare to a model with foveated-blurred input and a model with\nspatially-uniform blurred input (both matched for perceptual compression), and\na final reference model with minimal input-based compression. We find that: 1)\nthe foveated-texture model shows similar scene classification accuracy as the\nreference model despite its compressed input, with greater i.i.d.\ngeneralization than the other models; 2) the foveated-texture model has greater\nsensitivity to high-spatial frequency information and greater robustness to\nocclusion, w.r.t the comparison models; 3) both the foveated systems, show a\nstronger center image-bias relative to the spatially-uniform systems even with\na weight sharing constraint. Critically, these results are preserved over\ndifferent classical CNN architectures throughout their learning dynamics.\nAltogether, this suggests that foveation with peripheral texture-based\ncomputations yields an efficient, distinct, and robust representational format\nof scene information, and provides symbiotic computational insight into the\nrepresentational consequences that texture-based peripheral encoding may have\nfor processing in the human visual system, while also potentially inspiring the\nnext generation of computer vision models via spatially-adaptive computation.\nCode + Data available here: https://github.com/ArturoDeza/EmergentProperties\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Jun 2020 19:34:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2021 20:23:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 22 Jun 2021 21:21:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-24"}

Here we introduce the first known approach to support\nestimation in the presence of sampling artifacts and errors where each sample\nis assumed to arise from a Poisson repeat channel which simultaneously captures\nrepetitions and deletions of samples. The proposed estimator is based on\nregularized weighted Chebyshev approximations, with weights governed by\nevaluations of so-called Touchard (Bell) polynomials. The supports in the\npresence of sampling artifacts are calculated using discretized semi-infite\nprogramming methods. The estimation approach is tested on synthetic and textual\ndata, as well as on GISAID data collected to address a new problem in\ncomputational biology: mutational support estimation in genes of the SARS-Cov-2\nvirus. In the later setting, the Poisson channel captures the fact that many\nindividuals are tested multiple times for the presence of viral RNA, thereby\nleading to repeated samples, while other individual's results are not recorded\ndue to test errors.

We explore a new direction in\nthe field of adversarial attacks by suggesting attacks that aim to degrade the\ncomputational efficiency of DNNs rather than their classification accuracy.\nSpecifically, we propose and demonstrate sparsity attacks, which adversarial\nmodify a DNN's inputs so as to reduce sparsity (or the presence of zero values)\nin its internal activation values. In resource-constrained systems, a wide\nrange of hardware and software techniques have been proposed that exploit\nsparsity to improve DNN efficiency. The proposed attack increases the execution\ntime and energy consumption of sparsity-optimized DNN implementations, raising\nconcern over their deployment in latency and energy-critical applications.\n  We propose a systematic methodology to generate adversarial inputs for\nsparsity attacks by formulating an objective function that quantifies the\nnetwork's activation sparsity, and minimizing this function using iterative\ngradient-descent techniques. We launch both white-box and black-box versions of\nadversarial sparsity attacks on image recognition DNNs and demonstrate that\nthey decrease activation sparsity by up to 1.82x. We also evaluate the impact\nof the attack on a sparsity-optimized DNN accelerator and demonstrate\ndegradations up to 1.59x in latency, and also study the performance of the\nattack on a sparsity-optimized general-purpose processor.

Keeping in mind the observational bounds on the parameters - the\namplitude of scalar perturbations $A_s$, spectral index $n_s$ and\ntensor-to-scalar ratio $r$, we demonstrate that the model a quartic potential\nand the proposed coupling function is in agreement with observation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Jun 2020 21:27:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 15 Aug 2020 19:27:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-02"}

Typical\nkernel-based interpolation methods predict pixels with a single convolution\nprocess that convolves source frames with spatially adaptive local kernels,\nwhich circumvents the time-consuming, explicit motion estimation in the form of\noptical flow. However, when scene motion is larger than the pre-defined kernel\nsize, these methods are prone to yield less plausible results. In addition,\nthey cannot directly generate a frame at an arbitrary temporal position because\nthe learned kernels are tied to the midpoint in time between the input frames.\nIn this paper, we try to solve these problems and propose a novel non-flow\nkernel-based approach that we refer to as enhanced deformable separable\nconvolution (EDSC) to estimate not only adaptive kernels, but also offsets,\nmasks and biases to make the network obtain information from non-local\nneighborhood. During the learning process, different intermediate time step can\nbe involved as a control variable by means of an extension of coord-conv trick,\nallowing the estimated components to vary with different input temporal\ninformation. This makes our method capable to produce multiple in-between\nframes. Furthermore, we investigate the relationships between our method and\nother typical kernel- and flow-based methods.

In\nthis work, in order to address this issue, we first propose a framework for\ndeep-unfolding, where a general form of iterative algorithm induced\ndeep-unfolding neural network (IAIDNN) is developed in matrix form to better\nsolve the problems in communication systems. Then, we implement the proposed\ndeepunfolding framework to solve the sum-rate maximization problem for\nprecoding design in MU-MIMO systems. An efficient IAIDNN based on the structure\nof the classic weighted minimum mean-square error (WMMSE) iterative algorithm\nis developed. Specifically, the iterative WMMSE algorithm is unfolded into a\nlayer-wise structure, where a number of trainable parameters are introduced to\nreplace the highcomplexity operations in the forward propagation. To train the\nnetwork, a generalized chain rule of the IAIDNN is proposed to depict the\nrecurrence relation of gradients between two adjacent layers in the back\npropagation. Moreover, we discuss the computational complexity and\ngeneralization ability of the proposed scheme. Simulation results show that the\nproposed IAIDNN efficiently achieves the performance of the iterative WMMSE\nalgorithm with reduced computational complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jun 2020 02:57:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-16"}

In this paper, we\npropose a transactive control based optimization framework for coordinating the\npower grid network and the train network. This is accomplished by coordinating\ndispatchable distributed energy resources and demand profiles of trains using a\ntwo-step optimization. A railway based dynamic market mechanism (rDMM) is\nproposed for the dispatch of distributed energy resources (DER) in the power\nnetwork along the electric railway using an iterative negotiation process, and\ngenerates profiles of electricity prices, and constitutes the first step. The\ntrain dispatch attempts minimize the operational costs of trains that ply along\nthe railway, while subject to constraints on their acceleration profiles, route\nschedules, and the train dynamics, and generates demand profiles of trains and\nconstitutes the second step. The rDMM seeks to optimize the operational costs\nof the underlying DERs while ensuring power balance. Together, they form an\noverall framework that yields the desired transactions between the railway and\npower grid infrastructures. This overall optimization approach is validated\nusing simulation studies of the Southbound Amtrak service along the Northeast\nCorridor (NEC) in the United States, which shows a 25% reduction in energy\ncosts when compared to standard trip optimization based on minimum work, and a\n75% reduction in energy costs when compared to the train cost calculated using\na field dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jun 2020 04:04:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-16"}

According to the\nanalytic solution, the induced flow is analogous to a doublet flow in the sense\nthat the flow is directed towards the source within a conical region with its\nvertex at the source, and outside the conical region the flow moves away from\nthe source. The half cone angle for a negative source increases from $\\sim$60\ndegrees with increasing source strength and Schmidt number reaching values\ngreater than 80 degrees. When the cone angle is large, the outflow is\nrestricted to a thin annular boundary layer region.

As the\nsolute gradient at the surface gives rise to the force that drives the flow,\nwhen the solute diffusion coefficient is reduced the flow becomes stronger and\npersists longer because the solute gradient is maintained for a longer time and\ndistance.

Edge\ncomputing is envisioned to be an effective solution to process huge amount of\nIoT application data.

In addition, we study the VNF deployment problem under\nour synergic framework, and we formulate it as a mixed-integer nonlinear\nprogramming (MINLP) problem jointly considering the load balancing of\nnetworking and computing for chaining VNFs.

In this paper, we provide a fine-grained analysis of stability\nand generalization for SGD by substantially relaxing these assumptions.\nFirstly, we establish stability and generalization for SGD by removing the\nexisting bounded gradient assumptions. The key idea is the introduction of a\nnew stability measure called on-average model stability, for which we develop\nnovel bounds controlled by the risks of SGD iterates. This yields\ngeneralization bounds depending on the behavior of the best model, and leads to\nthe first-ever-known fast bounds in the low-noise setting using stability\napproach. Secondly, the smoothness assumption is relaxed by considering loss\nfunctions with Holder continuous (sub)gradients for which we show that optimal\nbounds are still achieved by balancing computation and stability.

We derive a corresponding intrinsic reward and develop a new\noff-policy meta-RL framework, which efficiently learns separate context-aware\nexploration and exploitation policies by sharing the knowledge of task\ninference. Experimental evaluation shows that our meta-RL method significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-art baselines on various sparse-reward MuJoCo\nlocomotion tasks and more complex sparse-reward Meta-World tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jun 2020 06:56:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 7 Feb 2021 00:04:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 19 Jul 2021 01:31:34 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 4 Oct 2021 02:42:18 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 12 Nov 2021 03:15:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-15"}

This has been extended to some cases of dependent variables (namely\nnegatively associated random variables) but in the general setting of dependent\nvariables, the problem remains open. This paper considers the case where each\nvariable $X_n$ is given as a linear combination $a_{n,1}Z_1+ \\ldots\n+a_{n,n}Z_n$ where $(Z_n)$ is a sequence of independent symmetrical random\nvariables of unit variance and $(a_{n,k})$ are constants.

These\ngames are played among randomly drawn agents from the population. The agents in\nour model can be individuals, sports teams, or Wall Street fund managers.\nFormally, we postulate that the likelihoods of game outcomes are governed by\nthe Bradley-Terry-Luce (or multinomial logit) model, where the probability of\nan agent beating another is the ratio between its skill level and the pairwise\nsum of skill levels, and the skill parameters are drawn from an unknown skill\ndensity of interest. The problem is, in essence, to learn a distribution from\nnoisy, quantized observations. We propose a simple and tractable algorithm that\nlearns the skill density with near-optimal minimax mean squared error scaling\nas $n^{-1+\\varepsilon}$, for any $\\varepsilon>0$, when the density is smooth.\nOur approach brings together prior work on learning skill parameters from\npairwise comparisons with kernel density estimation from non-parametric\nstatistics. Furthermore, we prove minimax lower bounds which establish minimax\noptimality of the skill parameter estimation technique used in our algorithm.\nThese bounds utilize a continuum version of Fano's method along with a covering\nargument. We apply our algorithm to various soccer leagues and world cups,\ncricket world cups, and mutual funds. We find that the entropy of a learnt\ndistribution provides a quantitative measure of skill, which provides rigorous\nexplanations for popular beliefs about perceived qualities of sporting events,\ne.g., soccer league rankings. Finally, we apply our method to assess the skill\ndistributions of mutual funds. Our results shed light on the abundance of low\nquality funds prior to the Great Recession of 2008, and the domination of the\nindustry by more skilled funds after the financial crisis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jun 2020 07:35:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-16"}

These distributions are determined\nprimarily by the multitude of states of a gene promoter, each driving\ntranscription at a different rate. In an era where single-cell mRNA copy number\ndata are more and more available, there is an increasing need for fast\ncomputations of mRNA distributions. In this paper, we present a method for\ncomputing separate distributions for each species of mRNA molecules, i. e.\nmRNAs that have been either partially or fully processed post-transcription.\nThe method involves the integration over all possible realizations of promoter\nstates, which we cast into a set of linear ordinary differential equations of\ndimension $M\\times n_j$, where $M$ is the number of available promoter states\nand $n_j$ is the mRNA copy number of species $j$ up to which one wishes to\ncompute the probability distribution.

In our approach, the equation for the\nprobability to observe $n$ mRNAs of any species depends only on the the\nprobability of observing $n-1$ mRNAs of that species, thus yielding a correct\nprobability distribution up to an arbitrary $n$.

They let\nweights converge more quickly with often better generalization performances. It\nhas been argued that the normalization-induced scale invariance among the\nweights provides an advantageous ground for gradient descent (GD) optimizers:\nthe effective step sizes are automatically reduced over time, stabilizing the\noverall training procedure. It is often overlooked, however, that the\nadditional introduction of momentum in GD optimizers results in a far more\nrapid reduction in effective step sizes for scale-invariant weights, a\nphenomenon that has not yet been studied and may have caused unwanted side\neffects in the current practice. This is a crucial issue because arguably the\nvast majority of modern deep neural networks consist of (1) momentum-based GD\n(e.g. SGD or Adam) and (2) scale-invariant parameters. In this paper, we verify\nthat the widely-adopted combination of the two ingredients lead to the\npremature decay of effective step sizes and sub-optimal model performances. We\npropose a simple and effective remedy, SGDP and AdamP: get rid of the radial\ncomponent, or the norm-increasing direction, at each optimizer step. Because of\nthe scale invariance, this modification only alters the effective step sizes\nwithout changing the effective update directions, thus enjoying the original\nconvergence properties of GD optimizers.

Our approach, which uses\nrobust optimization, reformulates these uncertain constraints into\ndeterministic constraints guaranteed to be satisfied with a specified\nprobability, i.e., deterministic approximations to a chance constraint. This\napproach extends robust optimization methods from parametric uncertainty to\nuncertain functions modeled by warped Gaussian processes. We analyze convexity\nconditions and propose a custom global optimization strategy for non-convex\ncases. A case study derived from production planning and an industrially\nrelevant example from oil well drilling show that the approach effectively\nmitigates uncertainty in the learned curves. For the drill scheduling example,\nwe develop a custom strategy for globally optimizing integer decisions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jun 2020 08:50:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-16"}

We focus\nboth on the axisymmetric configurations produced by the initial winding-up of\nthe magnetic field lines and on the possible instabilities of those\nconfigurations. We aim in particular at assessing the role of the\nstratification at stabilising the system. We perform 2D and 3D global\nBoussinesq numerical simulations started from an initial radial or cylindrical\ndifferential rotation and a large-scale poloidal magnetic field. Under the\nconditions of a large rotation frequency compared to the Alfv\\'en frequency, a\nmagnetic configuration strongly dominated by its toroidal component is built.\nThe parameters of the simulations are chosen to respect the ordering of time\nscales of a typical stellar radiative zone. In this framework, the axisymmetric\nevolution is studied by varying the relative effects of the thermal diffusion,\nthe Br\\\"unt-V\\\"ais\\\"al\\\"a frequency, the rotation and the initial poloidal\nfield strength. We find that the axisymmetric state only depends on\n$t_{es}/t_{Ap}$, the ratio between the Eddington-Sweet circulation time scale\nand the Alfv\\'en time scale. A scale analysis of the Boussinesq equations\nallows us to recover this result. In the cylindrical case, a magneto-rotational\ninstability develops when the thermal diffusivity is sufficiently high to\nenable the favored wavenumbers to be insensitive to the effects of the stable\nstratification. In the radial case, the magneto-rotational instability is\ndriven by the latitudinal shear created by the back-reaction of the Lorentz\nforce on the flow. Increasing the level of stratification then leaves the\ngrowth rate of the instability mainly unaffected while its horizontal length\nscale grows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jun 2020 09:03:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-02"}

To manage those massive proactive\nend-users efficiently, virtual power plant (VPP) as an innovative concept\nemerges. It can provide some necessary information to help consumers improve\ntheir profits and trade with the electricity market on behalf of them. One\nimportant information that is desired by the consumers is the prediction of\nrenewable outputs inside this VPP. Presently, most VPPs run in a centralized\nmanner, which means the VPP predicts the outputs of all the renewable sources\nit manages and provides the predictions to every consumer who buys this\ninformation. We prove that by providing predictions, the social total surplus\ncan be improved. However, when more consumers and renewables participate in the\nmarket, this centralized scheme needs extensive data communication and may\njeopardize the privacy of individual stakeholders. In this paper, we propose a\ndecentralized prediction provision algorithm in which consumers from each\nsubregion only buy local predictions and exchange information with the VPP.\nConvergence is proved under a mild condition, and the demand gap between\ncentralized and decentralized schemes is proved to have zero expectation and\nbounded variance.

However, the necessity of enormous fronthaul\nbandwidth between a remote radio head and a baseband unit (BBU) calls for novel\nsolutions. One of the solutions introduces the edge-cloud layer in addition to\nthe centralized cloud (CC) to keep resources closer to the radio units (RUs).\nThen, split the BBU functions between the center cloud (CC) and edge clouds\n(ECs) to reduce the fronthaul bandwidth requirement and to relax the stringent\nend-to-end delay requirements. This paper expands this architecture by\ncombining it with renewable energy sources in CC and ECs. We explain this novel\nsystem and formulate a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem, which\naims to reduce the operational expenditure of this system. Due to the NP-Hard\nproperty of this problem, we solve the smaller instances by using a MILP Solver\nand provide the results in this paper.

A similar\nproblem is to determine whether a given small set of neurons may be enough for\nthe behavior to be displayed, even if all other neurons in the circuit are\ndeactivated. Such a subset of neurons forms what is called a degenerate circuit\nfor the behavior being studied.\n  Recent advances in experimental techniques have provided researchers with\ntools to activate and deactivate subsets of neurons with a very high\nresolution, even in living animals. The data collected from such experiments\nmay be of the following form: when a given subset of neurons is deactivated, is\nthe behavior under study observed? This setting leads to the algorithmic\nquestion of determining the minimal vital or degenerate sets of neurons when\none is given as input a description of the neural circuit. The algorithmic\nproblem entails both figuring out which subsets of neurons should be perturbed\n(activated/deactivated), and then using the data from those perturbations to\ndetermine the minimal vital or degenerate sets.

It is shown that\nthe average of the solutions reconstructed at a face by Van Leer's kappa-scheme\nrecovers a cubic solution exactly with kappa = 1/3, the same is true for the\naverage of the nonlinear fluxes evaluated by the reconstructed solutions, and a\ndissipation term is already sufficiently small with a third-order truncation\nerror.

In this work we aim at characterizing the occurrence of water maser\nemission in an unbiased sample of AGN, investigating the relation with the\nX-ray properties and the possible favorable geometry needed to detect water\nmaser. We have searched for 22 GHz maser emission in a hard X-ray selected\nsample of AGN, taken from the INTEGRAL/IBIS survey above 20 keV.

Besides, we formulate a new strategy for enhancing the\nlocal intra-class compactness of the data manifold, which can achieve the joint\nlearning of locality-aware graph structure and desirable projection matrix. To\nalleviate the disturbance of outliers and prevent overfitting, we measure the\nregression term and locality-aware term together with the regularization term\nby the L2,1 norm. Further, forcing the row sparsity on the projection matrix\nthrough the L2,1 norm achieves the cooperation of feature selection and feature\nextraction.

Existing momentum trading models suffer from\ntime-lagging caused by the delayed frequency response of digital filters.\nTime-lagging results in a momentum signal of the wrong sign, when the market\nchanges trend direction. A key feature of this state space formulation, is no\nsuch lagging occurs, allowing for accurate shifts in signal sign at market\nchange points. The number of latent states in the model is estimated using\nthree techniques, cross validation, penalized likelihood criteria and\nsimulation-based model selection for the marginal likelihood. All three\ntechniques suggest either 2 or 3 hidden states. Model parameters are then found\nusing Baum-Welch and Markov Chain Monte Carlo, whilst assuming a single\n(discretized) univariate Gaussian distribution for the emission matrix.

In these autonomous settings,\nnon-parametric estimators of performance are an attractive solution. They do\nnot require theoretical models about how the classifiers made errors in any\ngiven sample. They just estimate how many errors there are in a sample of an\nindustrial or robotic datastream.

Our\napproach uses algebraic geometry to reformulate the self-assessment problem for\nensembles of binary classifiers as an exact polynomial system.

Under this trend, more turbines\nwill be installed in wind farms. However, the inspection of the turbines in an\noffshore wind farm is a challenging task because of the harsh environment\n(e.g., rough sea, strong wind, and so on) that leads to high risk for workers\nwho need to work at considerable height. Also, inspecting increasing number of\nturbines requires long man hours. In this regard, unmanned aerial vehicles\n(UAVs) can play an important role for automated inspection of the turbines for\nthe operator, thus reducing the inspection time, man hours, and correspondingly\nthe risk for the workers. In this case, the optimal number of UAVs enough to\ninspect all turbines in the wind farm is a crucial parameter. In addition,\nfinding the optimal path for the UAVs' routes for inspection is also important\nand is equally challenging. In this paper, we formulate a placement\noptimization problem to minimize the number of UAVs in the wind farm and a\nrouting optimization problem to minimize the inspection time. Wind has an\nimpact on the flying range and the flying speed of UAVs, which is taken into\naccount for both problems. The formulated problems are NP-hard. We therefore\ndesign heuristic algorithms to find solutions to both problems, and then\nanalyze the complexity of the proposed algorithms. The data of the Walney wind\nfarm are then utilized to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms.\nSimulation results clearly show that the proposed methods can obtain the\noptimal routing path for UAVs during the inspection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jun 2020 12:30:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Jun 2020 08:48:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-18"}

Both attacks are very powerful analysis concepts and\ncan be applied to symmetric cryptographic algorithms used in stream ciphers.\nThe notion of algebraic immunity has received wide attention since it is a\npowerful tool to measure the resistance of a Boolean function to standard\nalgebraic attacks. Nevertheless, an algebraic tool to handle the resistance to\nfast algebraic attacks is not clearly identified in the literature. In the\ncurrent paper, we propose a new parameter to measure the resistance of a\nBoolean function to fast algebraic attack.

Our primary contribution lies within combining robot learning of\nprimitives, commonly estimated by fully-convolutional neural networks, with\none-shot imitation learning. Therefore, we define the place reward as a\ncontrastive loss between real-world measurements and a task-specific noise\ndistribution.

Dark\nenergy is associated with de Sitter space and that has a fundamentally\ninvariant event horizon. I conceive of DE as a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC)\nof cosmologically massive photons and I estimate fundamentally the binding\nenergy per particle originating from an effectively attractive QM potential in\nthat BEC. Since massive photons may stand at rest in a de Sitter universe with\nflat spatial geometry, I solve the time-independent Schroedinger equation for a\nnon-relativistic attractive spherical-well potential self-confining at the de\nSitter horizon. The minimal critical potential depth that binds a particle\nstate at the top of that well, combined with the prototypical condition of dark\nenergy-pressure relation in the standard flat $\\Lambda$-CDM model, provides an\nestimate of the photon mass, $m_g$. That is supported by an independent\ncalculation of the vacuum energy of the BEC in a de Sitter static metric with\ncoordinate-time slicing. These estimates provide compatible accounts of dark\nenergy condensation, bridging a chasm between nuclear and cosmological scales.\nMost notably, I consider a system of cosmological units, or `$g$-units,' that\ncomplements the fundamental system of Planck units in various ways. The\ngeometric mean of Planck and $g$-mass turns out to be remarkably close to\ncurrent estimates of neutrino masses, suggesting that even masses of the\nlightest known fermions may be deeply related to both GR and QM fundamental\nconstants $\\Lambda$, $G$, $c$ and $h$.

Moreover, the assumptions encoded in the chosen\nmodel rarely represent some a priori known, ground truth, making standard\ninferences prone to bias, but also failing to give a pure reflection of the\ninformation that is contained in the data. Inspired by developments on\nassumption-free inference for so-called projection parameters, we here propose\nnovel nonparametric definitions of main effect estimands and effect\nmodification estimands.

We argue and demonstrate that this class can include both dynamic and\nstatic voltage instabilities. To determine the minimum distance to the point of\nvoltage collapse, a new formulation is proposed on the algebraic manifold.

In this work, we\nattempt to demystify the impact of movement in these directions towards\nattaining constrained minimizers. The best local direction of descent is the\ndirectional derivative of the projection of the gradient, which we refer to as\nthe $\\textit{shadow}$ of the gradient. We show that the continuous-time\ndynamics of moving in the shadow are equivalent to those of PGD however\nnon-trivial to discretize. By projecting gradients in PGD, one not only ensures\nfeasibility but is also able to \"wrap\" around the convex region.

Existing DNN based approaches rely\non the availability of a training set made up of a high number of RS images\nwith their captions. However, captions of training images may contain redundant\ninformation (they can be repetitive or semantically similar to each other),\nresulting in information deficiency while learning a mapping from the image\ndomain to the language domain. To overcome this limitation, in this paper, we\npresent a novel Summarization Driven Remote Sensing Image Captioning (SD-RSIC)\napproach. The proposed approach consists of three main steps. The first step\nobtains the standard image captions by jointly exploiting convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs) with long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. The second step,\nunlike the existing RS image captioning methods, summarizes the ground-truth\ncaptions of each training image into a single caption by exploiting sequence to\nsequence neural networks and eliminates the redundancy present in the training\nset. The third step automatically defines the adaptive weights associated to\neach RS image to combine the standard captions with the summarized captions\nbased on the semantic content of the image. This is achieved by a novel\nadaptive weighting strategy defined in the context of LSTM networks.\nExperimental results obtained on the RSCID, UCM-Captions and Sydney-Captions\ndatasets show the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to the\nstate-of-the-art RS image captioning approaches.

However,\ncomputing the transmit beamformer that maximizes the weighted sum rate subject\nto a power constraint is an NP-hard problem. As a result, iterative algorithms\nthat converge to a local optimum are used in practice. Among them, the weighted\nminimum mean square error (WMMSE) algorithm has gained popularity, but its\ncomputational complexity and consequent latency has motivated the need for\nlower-complexity approximations at the expense of performance. Motivated by the\nrecent success of deep unfolding in the trade-off between complexity and\nperformance, we propose the novel application of deep unfolding to the WMMSE\nalgorithm for a MISO downlink channel. The main idea consists of mapping a\nfixed number of iterations of the WMMSE algorithm into trainable neural network\nlayers, whose architecture reflects the structure of the original algorithm.\nWith respect to traditional end-to-end learning, deep unfolding naturally\nincorporates expert knowledge, with the benefits of immediate and well-grounded\narchitecture selection, fewer trainable parameters, and better explainability.\nHowever, the formulation of the WMMSE algorithm, as described in Shi et al., is\nnot amenable to be unfolded due to a matrix inversion, an eigendecomposition,\nand a bisection search performed at each iteration. Therefore, we present an\nalternative formulation that circumvents these operations by resorting to\nprojected gradient descent. By means of simulations, we show that, in most of\nthe settings, the unfolded WMMSE outperforms or performs equally to the WMMSE\nfor a fixed number of iterations, with the advantage of a lower computational\nload.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jun 2020 14:51:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-16"}

It is possible that\nthis extra flexibility is important for efficient problem solving and learning.\n  This paper introduces the Interaction Network. Interaction Networks aim to\ncapture some of this extra flexibility.\n  An Interaction Network consists of a collection of conventional neural\nnetworks, a set of memory locations, and a DQN or other reinforcement learner.\nThe DQN decides when each of the neural networks is executed, and on what\nmemory locations. In this way, the individual neural networks can be trained on\ndifferent data, for different tasks. At the same time, the results of the\nindividual networks influence the decision process of the reinforcement\nlearner. This results in a feedback loop that allows the DQN to perform actions\nthat improve its own decision-making.\n  Any existing type of neural network can be reproduced in an Interaction\nNetwork in its entirety, with only a constant computational overhead.\n  Interaction Networks can then introduce additional features to improve\nperformance further. These make the algorithm more flexible and general, but at\nthe expense of being harder to train.\n  In this paper, thought experiments are used to explore how the additional\nabilities of Interaction Networks could be used to improve various existing\ntypes of neural networks.\n  Several experiments have been run to prove that the concept is sound. These\nshow that the basic idea works, but they also reveal a number of challenges\nthat do not appear in conventional neural networks, which make Interaction\nNetworks very hard to train.\n  Further research needs to be done to alleviate these issues. A number of\npromising avenues of research to achieve this are outlined in this paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jun 2020 15:03:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-16"}

The EA consisted of six simple heuristics which manipulated\nstrings. The present work extends this by exploring the use of hyper-heuristics\nin group-theoretic cryptology for the first time. Hyper-heuristics are a way to\ngenerate new algorithms from existing algorithm components (in this case the\nsimple heuristics), with the EAs being one example of the type of algorithm\nwhich can be generated by our hyper-heuristic framework. We take as a starting\npoint the above EA and allow hyper-heuristics to build on it by making small\ntweaks to it. This adaptation is through a process of taking the EA and\ninjecting chains of heuristics built from the simple heuristics. We demonstrate\nwe can create novel heuristic chains, which when placed in the EA create\nalgorithms which out-perform the existing EA. The new algorithms solve a\nmarkedly greater number of random AAG instances than the EA for harder\ninstances.

In this framework, the mass and\nmomentum equations are addressed using the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM),\nwhile finite difference (FD) schemes solve an energy equation. Both systems are\ncoupled with each other thanks to an ideal gas equation of state. This work\naims at answering some questions regarding the numerical stability of such\nmodels, which strongly depends on the choice of numerical parameters. To this\nextent, several one- and two-dimensional HLBM classes based on different energy\nvariables, formulation (primitive or conservative), collision terms and\nnumerical schemes are scrutinized. Once appropriate corrective terms\nintroduced, it is shown that all continuous HLBM classes recover the\nNavier-Stokes Fourier behavior in the linear approximation.

Multiple instability mechanisms arising at relatively high Mach\nnumber are pointed out and two exhaustive stabilization strategies are\nintroduced: (1) decreasing the time step by changing the reference temperature\n$T_{ref}$ and (2) introducing a controllable numerical dissipation $\\sigma$ via\nthe collision operator. A complete parametric study reveals that only HLBM\nclasses based on the primitive and conservative entropy equations are found\nusable for compressible applications.

However,\napplications with large working set size often exhibit streaming and/or\nthrashing access patterns at LLC. As a result, a large fraction of the LLC\ncapacity is occupied by dead blocks that will not be referenced again, leading\nto inefficient utilization of the LLC capacity. To improve cache efficiency,\nthe state-of-the-art cache management techniques employ prediction mechanisms\nthat learn from the past access patterns with an aim to accurately identify as\nmany dead blocks as possible. Once identified, dead blocks are evicted from LLC\nto make space for potentially high reuse cache blocks.\n  In this thesis, we identify variability in the reuse behavior of cache blocks\nas the key limiting factor in maximizing cache efficiency for state-of-the-art\npredictive techniques. Variability in reuse prediction is inevitable due to\nnumerous factors that are outside the control of LLC. The sources of\nvariability include control-flow variation, speculative execution and\ncontention from cores sharing the cache, among others. Variability in reuse\nprediction challenges existing techniques in reliably identifying the end of a\nblock's useful lifetime, thus causing lower prediction accuracy, coverage, or\nboth. To address this challenge, this thesis aims to design robust cache\nmanagement mechanisms and policies for LLC in the face of variability in reuse\nprediction to minimize cache misses, while keeping the cost and complexity of\nthe hardware implementation low. To that end, we propose two cache management\ntechniques, one domain-agnostic and one domain-specialized, to improve cache\nefficiency by addressing variability in reuse prediction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jun 2020 15:43:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-16"}

Before we build and operate real systems, we must\nunderstand the science of radio propagation, and develop channel models that\nboth reflect the important propagation processes and allow a fair comparison of\ndifferent systems. In the past five decades, wireless systems have gone through\nfive generations, from supporting voice applications to enhanced mobile\nbroadband. To meet the ever increasing data rate demands of wireless systems,\nfrequency bands covering a wide range from 800 MHz to 100 GHz have been\nallocated for use. The standardization of these systems started in the\nearly/mid 1980's in Europe by the European Telecommunications Standards\nInstitute with the advent of Global System for Mobile Communications. This\nmotivated the development of the first standardized propagation model by the\nEuropean Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) 207 working group. These\nstandardization activities were continued and expanded for the third, fourth,\nand fifth generations of COST, as well as by the Third Generation Partnership\nProject, and the International Telecommunication Union. This paper presents a\nhistorical overview of the standardized propagation models covering first to\nfifth-generation systems. In particular, we discuss the evolution and\nstandardization of pathloss models, as well as large and small-scale fading\nparameters for single antenna and multiple antenna systems. Furthermore, we\npresent insights into the progress of deterministic modelling across the five\ngenerations of systems, as well as discuss more advanced modelling components\nneeded for the detailed simulations of millimeter-wave channels. A\ncomprehensive bibliography at the end of the paper will aid the interested\nreader to dig deeper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jun 2020 15:49:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-16"}

A radio halo is detected in 19 clusters, and\nfive clusters contain a relic source. Most of the brightest cluster galaxies\n(BCG) in relaxed clusters show radio emission with powers typical of FRII radio\ngalaxies, and some are surrounded by a radio mini-halo. The high frequency of\nradio emission from the BCG in relaxed clusters suggests that BCG feedback\nmechanisms are in place already at z about 0.6. The properties of radio halos\nand the small number of detected relics suggest redshift evolution in the\nproperties of diffuse sources. The radio power (and size) of radio halos could\nbe related to the number of past merger events in the history of the system.

However, the AIA approach is fairer to the farmers\nand more balanced in terms of average transportation distances that need to be\ncovered by each livestock farmer, while it is 1.07 times more eefficient than\nthe NBS. Our work constitutes the first application of a decentralized AIA to\nthis interesting real-world problem, in a domain where swarm intelligence\nmethods are still under-exploited.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Jun 2020 18:33:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-17"}

However, such methods\nalways resulted in significant accuracy degradation, when used below 8-bits\n(except on small datasets). Here we aim to break the 8-bit barrier. To this\nend, we minimize the quantization errors of each layer separately by optimizing\nits parameters over the calibration set.

In spite of its apparent simplicity, as the population\ngrowth-rate is increased the map exhibits a broad range of dynamics, which\ninclude bifurcation cascades going from periodic to chaotic solutions. Studying\ncoupled maps allows to identify other qualitative changes in the collective\ndynamics, such as pattern formations or hysteresis. Particularly, hysteresis is\nthe appearance of different attracting sets, a set when the control parameter\nis increased and another set when it is decreased -- a multi-stable region.

The present work focuses on the contributions from effective\nstress build-up due to reservoir depletion and decreases in brine salinity from\nlow-salinity water injection. Particle detachment is studied analytically by\nusing the critical retention concentration function modified with stress and\nsalinity dependents. Increase in formation effective stress leads to\ndeformations within the reservoir configurations due to micro-cracks and\nreduced pore dimensions. Decreased size of the travelling channels promotes\nparticle detachment, while the critical retention concentration decreases. A\nsensitivity study reveals that, under influence of effective stress, particle\nsize and fluid velocity are dominant parameters controlling the fines migration\nby influencing the particle detaching forces. With decreasing brine salinity\n(e.g. via low-salinity water injection), clay particles that are attached on\nthe pore surface increasingly swell, leading to reduction in effective pore\nspace and flow channel. Decreased pore space directly obstructs travelling of\nsuspended particles and fluids which results in permeability decline. Initial\nclay particle size is found to be a critical factor controlling particle\ndetachment behavior. Small initial particle sizes are not likely to detach from\nthe pore surface as a result of weak detaching forces, hence the analysis finds\nthe critical retention concentration unchanged resulting in negligible\npermeability decline as a function of brine salinity. Considering both effects,\neffective stress and brine salinity, stress-dependent effects dominate\nsalinity-dependent effects at low effective stress while the two contribute\nequally at high effective stress.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jun 2020 08:53:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-25"}

In this\nwork we use tools from nonlinear dynamics to analyze charge migration that\ntakes place along the backbone of conjugated hydrocarbons, which we simulate\nusing time-dependent density functional theory. In this electron-density\nframework we show that charge migration modes emerge as attosecond solitons and\ndemonstrate the same type of solitary-wave dynamics in both simplified model\nsystems and full three-dimensional molecular simulations. We show that these\nattosecond-soliton modes result from a balance between dispersion and nonlinear\neffects tied to time-dependent multi-electron interactions.%Our soliton-mode\nmechanism, and the nonlinear tools we use to analyze it, pave the way for\nunderstanding migration dynamics in a broad range of organic molecules.%For\ninstance, we demonstrate the opportunities for chemically steering charge\nmigration via molecular functionalization, which can alter both the initially\nlocalized electron perturbation and its subsequent time evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jun 2020 06:37:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Dec 2021 10:27:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 18 Jan 2022 08:39:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-07"}
