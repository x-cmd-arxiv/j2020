In this paper, we\ninvestigate the improvement when implementing maximum ratio combining (MRC) in\ncooperative VCs transmission schemes using non-orthogonal multiple access\nscheme (NOMA) at road intersections. We consider that a source transmits a\nmessage to two destinations with a aid of a relay. The transmission undergoes\ninterference generated from a set of vehicles on the roads.

The reasons for this remain unclear. When using standard\nsupervised methods (e.g., for bandits), on-policy data collection provides\n\"hard negatives\" that correct the model in precisely those states and actions\nthat the policy is likely to visit. We call this phenomenon \"corrective\nfeedback.\" We show that bootstrapping-based Q-learning algorithms do not\nnecessarily benefit from this corrective feedback, and training on the\nexperience collected by the algorithm is not sufficient to correct errors in\nthe Q-function. In fact, Q-learning and related methods can exhibit\npathological interactions between the distribution of experience collected by\nthe agent and the policy induced by training on that experience, leading to\npotential instability, sub-optimal convergence, and poor results when learning\nfrom noisy, sparse or delayed rewards. We demonstrate the existence of this\nproblem, both theoretically and empirically. We then show that a specific\ncorrection to the data distribution can mitigate this issue. Based on these\nobservations, we propose a new algorithm, DisCor, which computes an\napproximation to this optimal distribution and uses it to re-weight the\ntransitions used for training, resulting in substantial improvements in a range\nof challenging RL settings, such as multi-task learning and learning from noisy\nreward signals.

For most common utility functions, the expected\nutility is rarely available in closed form and requires a computationally\nexpensive approximation which then needs to be maximised over the space of all\npossible designs. This hinders practical use of the Bayesian approach to find\nexperimental designs. However, recently, a new utility called Fisher\ninformation gain has been proposed. The resulting expected Fisher information\ngain reduces to the prior expectation of the trace of the Fisher information\nmatrix.

In this context, as well as in many other social dilemmas, uncertainty\nmay produce non-trivial effects. Whereas uncertainty about collective targets\nand their impact were shown to negatively affect group coordination and\nsuccess, no information is available about timing uncertainty, i.e. how\nuncertainty about when the target needs to be reached affects the outcome as\nwell as the decision-making. Here we show experimentally, through a collective\ndilemma wherein groups of participants need to avoid a tipping point under the\nrisk of collective loss, that timing uncertainty prompts not only early\ngenerosity but also polarized contributions, in which participants' total\ncontributions are distributed more unfairly than when there is no uncertainty.\nAnalyzing participant behavior reveals, under uncertainty, an increase in\nreciprocal strategies wherein contributions are conditional on the previous\ndonations of the other participants, a group analogue of the well-known\nTit-for-Tat strategy. Although large timing uncertainty appears to reduce\ncollective success, groups that successfully collect the required amount show\nstrong reciprocal coordination. This conclusion is supported by a game\ntheoretic model examining the dominance of behaviors in case of timing\nuncertainty.

The calculation of the contribution of such a diagram to the\nscattering amplitude requires the calculation of a fourfold integral over the\nfour-momenta components circulating in a loop. The essence of the Laplace\nmethod for the calculation of multiple integrals lies in the fact that if the\nmodule of an integrand has a point of sufficiently sharp maximum inside the\nintegration domain, then the integral can be replaced by a Gaussian integral by\nrepresenting the integrand in the form of an exponent from the logarithm and\nexpanding this logarithm into Taylor series in the vicinity of a maximum point\nup to the second degree terms. We show that there are two-dimensional and\nnon-intersecting surfaces inside the four-dimensional region of integration, on\nwhich the maximum of the module of integrand is reached. This leads to a\nproblem that the integrand is non-analytically dependent on the parameters\nresponsible for bypassing the poles. Also the derivatives of logarithm of the\nscattering amplitude are non-analytically dependent on these parameters.\nHowever, in the paper we show that these non-analyticities compensate each\nother. As a result of such a procedure, three of the four integrations can be\ndone analytically, and the calculation of the contribution of the diagram to\nthe scattering amplitude is reduced to a numerical calculation of the single\nintegral in finite bounds from an expression that does not contain\nnon-analyticities.

Our analysis demonstrates that superfluid dark matter fits the\ndata well with parameters in reasonable ranges. The most notable difference\nbetween superfluid dark matter and MOND is that superfluid dark matter requires\nabout $ 20\\% $ less total baryonic mass (with a suitable interpolation\nfunction).

With RSVQA, we\npropose a system to extract information from remote sensing data that is\naccessible to every user: we use questions formulated in natural language and\nuse them to interact with the images. With the system, images can be queried to\nobtain high level information specific to the image content or relational\ndependencies between objects visible in the images. Using an automatic method\nintroduced in this article, we built two datasets (using low and high\nresolution data) of image/question/answer triplets. The information required to\nbuild the questions and answers is queried from OpenStreetMap (OSM). The\ndatasets can be used to train (when using supervised methods) and evaluate\nmodels to solve the RSVQA task. We report the results obtained by applying a\nmodel based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for the visual part and on\na Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for the natural language part to this task.\nThe model is trained on the two datasets, yielding promising results in both\ncases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Mar 2020 17:09:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 May 2020 14:05:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-15"}

One\nproposed solution is to introduce a new component in the early universe, which\ninitially acts as \"early dark energy\" (EDE), thus decreasing the physical size\nof the sound horizon imprinted in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and\nincreasing the inferred $H_0$. Previous EDE analyses have shown this model can\nrelax the $H_0$ tension, but the CMB-preferred value of the density fluctuation\namplitude, $\\sigma_8$, increases in EDE as compared to $\\Lambda$CDM, increasing\ntension with large-scale structure (LSS) data. We show that the EDE model fit\nto CMB and SH0ES data yields scale-dependent changes in the matter power\nspectrum compared to $\\Lambda$CDM, including $10\\%$ more power at $k =\n1~h$/Mpc. Motivated by this observation, we reanalyze the EDE scenario,\nconsidering LSS data in detail. We also update previous analyses by including\n$Planck$ 2018 CMB likelihoods, and perform the first search for EDE in $Planck$\ndata alone, which yields no evidence for EDE. We consider several data set\ncombinations involving the primary CMB, CMB lensing, SNIa, BAO, RSD, weak\nlensing, galaxy clustering, and local distance-ladder data (SH0ES). While the\nEDE component is weakly detected (3$\\sigma$) when including the SH0ES data and\nexcluding most LSS data, this drops below 2$\\sigma$ when further LSS data are\nincluded. Further, this result is in tension with strong constraints imposed on\nEDE by CMB and LSS data without SH0ES, which show no evidence for this model.\nWe also show that physical priors on the fundamental scalar field parameters\nfurther weaken evidence for EDE. We conclude that the EDE scenario is, at best,\nno more likely to be concordant with all current cosmological data sets than\n$\\Lambda$CDM, and appears unlikely to resolve the $H_0$ tension.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Mar 2020 17:59:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Apr 2020 23:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 2020 19:00:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-12"}

These results are\nused to provide the combined contribution of these systematic effects on the\nerror budget.

Taking boosted dark matter\nas a concrete example of energetic light dark matter, we scrutinize two\nrepresentative search channels, electron scattering and proton scattering\nincluding deep inelastic scattering processes, in the context of elastic and\ninelastic boosted dark matter, in a completely detector-independent manner. In\nthis work, a dark gauge boson is adopted as the particle to mediate the\ninteractions between the Standard Model particles and boosted dark matter. We\nfind that the signal sensitivity of the two channels highly depends on the\n(mass-)parameter region to probe, so search strategies and channels should be\ndesigned sensibly especially at the earlier stage of experiments. In\nparticular, the contribution from the boosted-dark-matter-initiated deep\ninelastic scattering can be subleading (important) compared to the\nquasi-elastic proton scattering, if the mass of the mediator is below (above)\n$\\mathcal{O}$(GeV).

Our data shows that many JS libraries are only partially\nutilized during a page load, and therefore, contain superfluous code that is\nnever executed. Many top-ranked websites contain up to hundreds of kilobytes of\ncompressed superfluous code and a JS resource on a median page contains 31%\nsuperfluous code. Superfluous JS code inflates the page weight, and thereby,\nthe time to download, parse, and compile a JS resource. It is therefore\nimportant to monitor the usage and optimize the payload of JS resources to\nimprove Web performance. However, given that the webpage design and\nfunctionality could depend on a user's preferences or device, among many other\nfactors, actively loading webpages in controlled environments cannot cover all\npossible conditions in which webpage content and functionality changes. In this\npaper, we show that passive measurement techniques, such as real user\nmonitoring systems (RUM), that monitor the performance of real user page loads\nunder different conditions can be leveraged to identify superfluous code.

The DL-MTV\nsystem, which is based on the generation and tracking of two parallel thin\nHe$^*_2$ molecular tracer lines with an adjustable separation distance, allows\nus to measure not only the velocity profile but also both the transverse and\nlongitudinal spatial velocity structure functions. We have also installed a\ndeferential pressure sensor to the flow pipe for pressure drop measurement. The\ntesting results of the flow facility and the measurement devices are presented.\nWe discuss how this facility will allow us to solve some outstanding problems\nin the helium heat-and-mass transfer topic area.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Mar 2020 19:30:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-20"}

As with many PAKE\nprotocols, two participants use knowledge of a pre-shared password to\nauthenticate each other and establish a session key. SRP aims to resist\ndictionary attacks, not store plaintext-equivalent passwords on the server,\navoid patent infringement, and avoid export controls by not using encryption.\nFormal analysis of SRP is challenging in part because existing tools provide no\nsimple way to reason about its use of the mathematical expression $v + g^b \\mod\nq$.\n  Modeling $v + g^b$ as encryption, we complete an exhaustive study of all\npossible execution sequences of SRP. Ignoring possible algebraic attacks, this\nanalysis detects no major structural weakness, and in particular no leakage of\nany secrets. We do uncover one notable weakness of SRP, which follows from its\ndesign constraints. It is possible for a malicious server to fake an\nauthentication session with a client, without the client's participation. This\naction might facilitate an escalation of privilege attack, if the client has\nhigher privileges than does the server.

In this paper,\nwe validate CGH on ResNet, Inception, and VGG models on ImageNet. Since the\ntechniques presented in the original paper do not scale beyond toy models and\ndatasets, we propose new methods. By posing the problem of suppressing weak\ngradient directions as a problem of robust mean estimation, we develop a\ncoordinate-based median of means approach. We present two versions of this\nalgorithm, M3, which partitions a mini-batch into 3 groups and computes the\nmedian, and a more efficient version RM3, which reuses gradients from previous\ntwo time steps to compute the median. Since they suppress weak gradient\ndirections without requiring per-example gradients, they can be used to train\nmodels at scale. Experimentally, we find that they indeed greatly reduce\noverfitting (and memorization) and thus provide the first convincing evidence\nthat CGH holds at scale. We also propose a new test of CGH that does not depend\non adding noise to training labels or on suppressing weak gradient directions.\nUsing the intuition behind CGH, we posit that the examples learned early in the\ntraining process (i.e., \"easy\" examples) are precisely those that have more in\ncommon with other training examples. Therefore, as per CGH, the easy examples\nshould generalize better amongst themselves than the hard examples amongst\nthemselves. We validate this hypothesis with detailed experiments, and believe\nthat it provides further orthogonal evidence for CGH.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Mar 2020 19:32:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Jul 2020 17:33:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-22"}

The crucial role played by the quantum fluctuations suggests that\nthe geometry associated with the fixed point exhibits non-manifold like\nproperties. In this work, we continue the characterization of this geometry\nemploying the composite operator formalism based on the effective average\naction.

An IRS\nis deployed to enhance the performance of the secondary network while helping\nto mitigate the interference caused to the primary users (PUs). The DL transmit\nbeamforming vectors and the UL receive beamforming vectors at the FD BS, the\ntransmit power of the UL users, and the phase shift matrix at the IRS are\njointly optimized for maximization of the total sum rate of the secondary\nsystem. The design task is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem\ntaking into account the imperfect knowledge of the PUs' channel state\ninformation (CSI) and their maximum interference tolerance.

Classic stability methods are not well-suited for these dynamic\nsystems as they involve centralized gathering of information and computation of\nthe system's eigenvalues, processes which are oftentimes not privacy-preserving\nand computationally burdensome. System operators (SOs) would nowadays have to\nbe able to quickly and efficiently assess small-signal stability as the power\ngrid operating conditions change more dynamically while also respect the\nprivacy of the distributed energy resources (DERs). Motivated by all these, in\nthis paper we introduce a framework that comprises a computationally efficient,\nprivacy-preserving, distributed and compositional stability assessment method.\nOur proposed method first calls for representative agents at various buses to\nexchange information with their neighbors and design their local controls in\norder to meet some local stability conditions. Following that, the agents are\nrequired to notify the SO whether their local conditions are satisfied or not.\nIn case the agents cannot verify their local conditions they can augment their\nlocal controls using a global control input. The SO can then warrant stability\nof the interconnected power grid by assembling the local stability guarantees,\nestablished by the agents, in a compositional manner. We analytically derive\nthe local stability conditions and prove that when they are collectively\nsatisfied stability of the interconnected system ensues. We illustrate the\neffectiveness of our proposed DSA method via a numerical example centered\naround a three-bus power grid.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Mar 2020 23:57:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-18"}

This\noften leads to poor productivity and portability and is inconvenient for a\nnon-programmer domain-specialist such as a Physicist. More desirable is a\nhigh-level language where the domain-specialist simply specifies the workload\nin terms of high-level operations (e.g., matrix-multiply(A, B)), and the\ncompiler identifies the best implementation fully utilizing the heterogeneous\nplatform. For creating a compiler that supports productivity, portability, and\nperformance simultaneously, it is crucial to predict the performance of various\navailable implementations (variants) of the dominant operations (kernels)\ncontained in the workload on various hardware to decide (a) which variant\nshould be chosen for each kernel in the workload, and (b) on which hardware\nresource the variant should run. To enable the performance prediction, we\npropose lightweight augmented neural networks for arbitrary combinations of\nkernel-variant-hardware. A key innovation is utilizing the mathematical\ncomplexity of the kernels as a feature to achieve higher accuracy. These models\nare compact to reduce training time and fast inference during compile-time and\nrun-time. Using models with less than 75 parameters, and only 250 training data\ninstances, we are able to obtain a low MAPE of 3%, significantly outperforming\ntraditional feed-forward neural networks on 48 kernel-variant-hardware\ncombinations.

There is a tradeoff between the smoothing\nquality and the processing speed: the high smoothing quality usually requires a\nhigh computational cost which leads to the low processing speed. In this paper,\nwe propose a new global optimization based method, named iterative least\nsquares (ILS), for efficient edge-preserving image smoothing. Our approach can\nproduce high-quality results but at a much lower computational cost.\nComprehensive experiments demonstrate that the propose method can produce\nresults with little visible artifacts. Moreover, the computation of ILS can be\nhighly parallel, which can be easily accelerated through either multi-thread\ncomputing or the GPU hardware. With the acceleration of a GTX 1080 GPU, it is\nable to process images of 1080p resolution ($1920\\times1080$) at the rate of\n20fps for color images and 47fps for gray images. In addition, the ILS is\nflexible and can be modified to handle more applications that require different\nsmoothing properties.

The walking behavior of a human\nwearing a powered prosthesis is obtained through motion capture, which yields\nthe limb and joint trajectories. Then a nominal trajectory is obtained by\nsolving a gait optimization problem designed to reconstruct the walking\nbehavior observed by motion capture. Moreover, the interaction force profiles\nbetween the human and the prosthesis are recovered by simulating the model\nfollowing the recorded gaits, which are then used to construct a force tube\nthat covers all the interaction force profiles. Finally, a robust Control\nLyapunov Function (CLF) Quadratic Programming (QP) controller is designed to\nguarantee the convergence to the nominal trajectory under all possible\ninteraction forces within the tube.

However, reducing the noise\nthrough the controlled translocating of the DNA nucleobases is a central issue\nfor the developing nanogap nanopore based DNA sequencing to achieve single\nnucleobase resolution. Furthermore, the high reactivity of the graphene pores\ngaps exhibits clogging of the pore gap, leading to the blockage of the pores\ngaps, yielding sticking, and irreversible pore closure. To address the\nprospective of functionalization of carbon nanostructure and for accomplishing\nthis objective, herein, we have studied the performance of functionalized\nclosed end cap carbon nanotube CNT nanogap embedded electrodes which can\nimprove the coupling through nonbonding electrons and may provide the\npossibility of N and O and H pi interaction with nucleotides, as single\nstranded DNA is transmigrated across.

Weak hydrogen bonds formed\nbetween the probe molecule and target DNA nucleobase enhance the electronic\ncoupling and temporarily stabilize the translocating nucleobase against the\norientational fluctuations, which may reduce noise in the current signal during\nexperimental measurements. The findings of our density functional theory and\nnon equilibrium Greens function based study indicates that this modeled setup\ncould allow DNA nucleotide sequencing with a better and reliable yield, giving\ncurrent traces that differ by at least 1 order of current magnitude for all\nfour target nucleotides.

The aim of pre-separation stage is to separate the\nmixture preliminarily. Although this stage can separate the mixture, it still\ncontains the residual interference. In order to enhance the pre-separated\nspeech and improve the separation performance further, the end-to-end\npost-filter (E2EPF) with deep attention fusion features is proposed. The E2EPF\ncan make full use of the prior knowledge of the pre-separated speech, which\ncontributes to speech separation. It is a fully convolutional speech separation\nnetwork and uses the waveform as the input features. Firstly, the 1-D\nconvolutional layer is utilized to extract the deep representation features for\nthe mixture and pre-separated signals in the time domain. Secondly, to pay more\nattention to the outputs of the pre-separation stage, an attention module is\napplied to acquire deep attention fusion features, which are extracted by\ncomputing the similarity between the mixture and the pre-separated speech.\nThese deep attention fusion features are conducive to reduce the interference\nand enhance the pre-separated speech. Finally, these features are sent to the\npost-filter to estimate each target signals. Experimental results on the\nWSJ0-2mix dataset show that the proposed method outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art speech separation method.

The Spray G injector and\noperating conditions, developed by the Engine Combustion Network (ECN),\nrepresent the early phase of spray-guided gasoline injection. To focus the\ncomputational resources on resolving the primary breakup, simplifications have\nbeen made on the injector geometry. The effect of the internal flow on the\nprimary breakup is modeled by specifying a nonzero injection angle at the\ninlet. The nonzero injection angle results in an increase of the jet\npenetration speed and also a deflection of the liquid jet. A parametric study\non the injection angle is performed, and the numerical results are compared to\nthe experimental data to identify the injection angle that best represents the\nSpray G conditions. The nonzero injection angle introduces an azimuthally\nnon-uniform velocity in the liquid jet, which in turn influences the\ninstability development on the jet surfaces and also the deformation and\nbreakup of the jet head. The asymmetric primary breakup dynamics eventually\nlead to an azimuthal variation of droplet size distributions.

Recently, many researchers\nhave used the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) to model spatial-temporal\nfeatures of skeleton sequences by an end-to-end optimization. However,\nconventional GCNs are feedforward networks which are impossible for low-level\nlayers to access semantic information in the high-level layers. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel network, named Feedback Graph Convolutional Network (FGCN).\nThis is the first work that introduces the feedback mechanism into GCNs and\naction recognition. Compared with conventional GCNs, FGCN has the following\nadvantages: (1) a multi-stage temporal sampling strategy is designed to extract\nspatial-temporal features for action recognition in a coarse-to-fine\nprogressive process; (2) A dense connections based Feedback Graph Convolutional\nBlock (FGCB) is proposed to introduce feedback connections into the GCNs. It\ntransmits the high-level semantic features to the low-level layers and flows\ntemporal information stage by stage to progressively model global\nspatial-temporal features for action recognition; (3) The FGCN model provides\nearly predictions. In the early stages, the model receives partial information\nabout actions. Naturally, its predictions are relatively coarse. The coarse\npredictions are treated as the prior to guide the feature learning of later\nstages for a accurate prediction. Extensive experiments on the datasets,\nNTU-RGB+D, NTU-RGB+D120 and Northwestern-UCLA, demonstrate that the proposed\nFGCN is effective for action recognition. It achieves the state-of-the-art\nperformance on the three datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Mar 2020 07:20:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-18"}

However, by making use of\nusers' quality of experience (QoE) awareness factors, including the relative\nmoving speed and depth difference between the viewpoint and other content,\nbandwidth consumption can be reduced. In this paper, we propose OFB-VR (Optical\nFlow Based VR), an interactive method of VR streaming that can make use of VR\nusers' QoE awareness to ease the bandwidth pressure.

At variance with other\nmechanisms such as charge noise, phonons are intrinsic to the device and can\nhardly be mitigated. They set, therefore fundamental limits to the relaxation\ntime of the qubits. Here we introduce a general framework for the calculation\nof the spin (and charge) transition rates induced by bulk (3D) and strongly\nconfined 1D or 2D phonons. We discuss the particular case of hole spin-orbit\nqubits described by the 6 bands kp model. We next apply this theory to a hole\nqubit in a silicon-on-insulator device. We show that spin relaxation in this\ndevice is dominated by a band mixing term that couples the holes to transverse\nacoustic phonons through the valence band deformation potential d, and optimize\nthe bias point and magnetic field orientation to maximize the number of Rabi\noscillations Q that can be achieved within on relaxation time T1. Despite the\nstrong spin-orbit coupling in the valence band, the phonon-limited Q can reach\na few tens of thousands. We next explore the effects of phonon confinement in\n1D and 2D structures, and the impact of the encapsulation materials on the\nrelaxation rates. We show that the spin lifetimes can depend on the structure\nof the device over micrometer-long length scales and that they improve when the\nmaterials around the qubit get harder. Phonon engineering in semiconductor\nqubits may therefore become relevant once the extrinsic sources of relaxation\nhave been reduced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Mar 2020 09:17:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Aug 2020 08:10:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-19"}

To take advantage of event cameras, some methods have\nbeen proposed to reconstruct intensity images from event streams.

The\nlow-quality outputs stem broader applications of event cameras, where high\nspatial resolution (HR) is needed as well as high temporal resolution, dynamic\nrange, and no motion blur.

We numerically solve the\nkinetic equation for electron evolution in the blob, taking into account\nparticle injection, escape, acceleration and radiative cooling. In order to\ncalculate the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the blob emission we assume\na synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) scenario, including also synchrotron self\nabsorption and gamma-gamma absorption processes. Our code computes the\nevolution of the electron spectrum and of the associated broad-band SED. As a\nfirst application, we attempt to connect the continuous, steady-state emission\nfrom the blazar Mrk 421 with a flare observed in February 2010, using a minimal\nnumber of free parameters in a two-zone scenario in which a turbulent region is\npresent around the emitting zone. Mrk 421 is a high-synchrotron-peaked (HSP) BL\nLac, and one of the brightest extragalactic gamma-ray sources in the Very High\nEnergy (VHE) gamma-ray band. It is also the closest TeV emitting blazar to the\nEarth (redshift z=0.031).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Mar 2020 12:29:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-18"}

These changes can be due to the unpredictable evolution of\nturbulent layers on meteorological timescales as short as minutes.

It can introduce systematic errors on the inferred\nplanetary parameters when a small number of transits are observed. The\nobjective of this paper is to characterize the statistical properties of this\nnoise and quantify its impact on the inferred transit parameters. We used the\nextensive solar observations obtained with SoHO/VIRGO to characterize flicker\nnoise. We simulated realistic transits across the solar disk using SDO/HMI data\nand used these to obtain transit light curves, which we used to estimate the\nerrors made on the transit parameters. We make these light curves publicly\navailable. To extend the study to a wider parameter range, we derived the\nproperties of flicker noise using Kepler observations and studied their\ndependence on stellar parameters. Finally, we predicted the limiting stellar\napparent magnitude for which the properties of the flicker noise can be\nextracted using high-precision CHEOPS and PLATO observations. Stellar\ngranulation is a stochastic colored noise, and is stationary with respect to\nthe stellar magnetic cycle. Both the flicker correlation timescales and\namplitudes increase with the stellar mass and radius. If these correlations are\nnot taken into account when fitting for the parameters of transiting\nexoplanets, this can bias the inferred parameters. In particular, we find\nerrors of up to 10$\\%$ on $R_p/R_s$ for an Earth-sized planet orbiting a\nSun-like star. For F and G stars, flicker will significantly affect the\ninferred parameters of transits observed with CHEOPS and PLATO.

For example, a well-trained model on webface data cannot deal\nwith the ID vs. Spot task in surveillance scenario. In this paper, we aim to\nlearn a generalized model that can directly handle new unseen domains without\nany model updating. To this end, we propose a novel face recognition method via\nmeta-learning named Meta Face Recognition (MFR). MFR synthesizes the\nsource/target domain shift with a meta-optimization objective, which requires\nthe model to learn effective representations not only on synthesized source\ndomains but also on synthesized target domains. Specifically, we build\ndomain-shift batches through a domain-level sampling strategy and get\nback-propagated gradients/meta-gradients on synthesized source/target domains\nby optimizing multi-domain distributions. The gradients and meta-gradients are\nfurther combined to update the model to improve generalization. Besides, we\npropose two benchmarks for generalized face recognition evaluation.

Therefore, temporal priors, such as the average\naction duration of training data, which have been exploited by previous action\ndetection methods, are not suitable for this task because of the high\nintra-class variation in human actions.

It is also useful to simulate\nthe longitudinal behavior of the vehicle with high fidelity. In this paper, a\nstraightforward and generic method for obtaining the friction, braking and\npropulsion forces as a function of speed, throttle input and brake input is\nproposed. Experimental data is recorded during tests over the full speed range\nto estimate the forces, to which the corresponding curves are adjusted. A\nsimple and direct balance of forces in the direction tangent to the ground is\nused to obtain an estimation of the real forces involved.

They are launched with a significant amount of magnetic\nenergy, which can be dissipated to accelerate nonthermal particles and give\nrise to electromagnetic radiation at larger scales. Kink instabilities can be\nan efficient mechanism to trigger dissipation of jet magnetic energy. While\nprevious works have studied the conditions required for the growth of kink\ninstabilities in relativistic jets, the radiation signatures of these\ninstabilities have not been investigated in detail. In this paper, we aim to\nself-consistently study radiation and polarization signatures from kink\ninstabilities in relativistic jets. We combine large-scale relativistic\nmagnetohydrodynamic (RMHD) simulations with polarized radiation transfer of a\nmagnetized jet, which emerges from the central engine and propagates through\nthe surrounding medium. We observe that a localized region at the central spine\nof the jet exhibits the strongest kink instabilities, which we identify as the\njet emission region. Very interestingly, we find quasi-periodic oscillation\n(QPO) signatures in the light curve from the emission region. Additionally, the\npolarization degree appears to be anti-correlated to flares in the light\ncurves. Our analyses show that these QPO signatures are intrinsically driven by\nkink instabilities, where the period of the QPOs is associated to the kink\ngrowth time scale. The latter corresponds to weeks to months QPOs in blazars.\nThe polarization signatures offer unique diagnostics for QPOs driven by kink\ninstabilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Mar 2020 15:28:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-01"}

We show that depending on the shape of the electric\ndipole function $d_e(q)$ along the vibrational mode coordinate $q$, molecules\ncan be classified into three general families. For molecules that are polar and\nhave a positive slope of the dipole function at equilibrium, we show that an\ninitial diabatic light-matter product state without vibrational or cavity\nexcitations can evolve into a polariton wavepacket with a large number of\nintracavity photons, for interaction strengths at the onset of ultrastrong\ncoupling.

However,\ndifferent continua may change the deconvolution results of these parameters.\nThis paper investigates the diagnostic spectral features of olivine with\ndiverse chemical compositions. Four different continuum removal methods with\nMGM for getting the deconvolution results are presented and the regression\nequations for predicting the Mg-number (Fo#) are introduced. The results show\nthat different continua superimposed on the mineral absorption features will\nmake the absorption center shift, as well as the obvious alterations in shape,\nwidth, and strength of the absorption band.

As an application example, the improved\napproach is applied to pulse laser irradiated olivine grains to simulate and\nstudy the space weathering effects on olivine diagnostic spectral features.

We consider\nvehicle-sharing in a company having one or more depots and a fixed number of\nusers, i.e. employees. The users have appointments with a fixed location and\nfixed start and end times. A vehicle must be used for a full trip of a user\nfrom depot to depot. We aim at assigning vehicles to user trips so as to\nmaximize savings compared to other modes of transport. We first consider that\nonly one type of vehicle is used, and second that multiple vehicle types can be\nused. For the first case, we show that the vehicle-sharing problem can be\nformulated as a minimum-cost flow problem. Secondly, if multiple types of\nvehicles are available the problem can be formulated as a multi-commodity flow\nproblem. These formulations make the problem applicable in daily operations due\nto efficient solution methods. We provide a comprehensive computational study\nfor both cases on instances based on demographic, spatial, and economic data of\nVienna. We show that our formulations for this problem solve these instances in\na few seconds, which makes them usable in an online booking system. In the\nanalysis we discuss different potential settings. We study the optimal\ncomposition of a shared fleet, restricted sets of modes of transport, and\nvariations of the objective function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Mar 2020 11:12:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Sep 2022 12:20:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-29"}

This problem is computationally challenging due to the complex\nsystem dynamics, various spatial and temporal couplings as well as multiple\ncontrol variables to be coordinated. To address the challenges, we propose a\ntwo-level distributed method (TLDM) with a upper level and lower level control\nintegrated. The upper level computes zone mass flow rates for maintaining zone\nthermal comfort with minimal energy cost, and then the lower level\nstrategically regulates zone mass flow rates and the ventilation rate to\nachieve IAQ while preserving the near energy saving performance of upper level.\nAs both the upper and lower level computation are deployed in a distributed\nmanner, the proposed method is scalable and computationally efficient. The\nnear-optimal performance of the method in energy cost saving is demonstrated\nthrough comparison with the centralized method. In addition, the comparisons\nwith the existing distributed method show that our method can provide IAQ with\nonly little increase of energy cost while the latter fails. Moreover, we\ndemonstrate our method outperforms the demand controlled ventilation strategies\n(DCVs) for IAQ management with about 8-10% energy cost reduction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Mar 2020 07:29:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2021 12:00:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-05"}

While a plethora of methods have been proposed for static point\ncloud denoising, few efforts are made for the denoising of dynamic point\nclouds, which is quite challenging due to the irregular sampling patterns both\nspatially and temporally. In this paper, we represent dynamic point clouds\nnaturally on spatial-temporal graphs, and exploit the temporal consistency with\nrespect to the underlying surface (manifold). In particular, we define a\nmanifold-to-manifold distance and its discrete counterpart on graphs to measure\nthe variation-based intrinsic distance between surface patches in the temporal\ndomain, provided that graph operators are discrete counterparts of functionals\non Riemannian manifolds. Then, we construct the spatial-temporal graph\nconnectivity between corresponding surface patches based on the temporal\ndistance and between points in adjacent patches in the spatial domain.\nLeveraging the initial graph representation, we formulate dynamic point cloud\ndenoising as the joint optimization of the desired point cloud and underlying\ngraph representation, regularized by both spatial smoothness and temporal\nconsistency.

Current efforts on modeling blood flow have\nprimarily focused on the flow properties of blood with red blood cells (RBCs)\nhaving a viscosity ratio $C$ of unity between the cytosol and suspending\nmedium, while under physiological conditions the cytosol viscosity is about\nfive times larger than the plasma viscosity (i.e., $C\\approx 5$).

We employ mesoscopic hydrodynamic simulations to perform a systematic\ninvestigation of flow properties of RBC suspensions with different cytosol\nviscosities for various flow conditions in cylindrical microchannels. Our main\naim is to link macroscopic flow properties such as flow resistance to single\ncell deformation and dynamics as a function of $C$. Starting from a dispersed\ncell configuration, we find that the flow convergence and the development of a\nRBC-free layer (RBC-FL) depend only weakly on $C$, and require a convergence\nlength in the range of $25D-50D$, where $D$ is the channel diameter. The flow\nresistance for $C=5$ is nearly the same as that for $C=1$, which is facilitated\nby a slightly larger RBC-FL thickness for $C=5$. This effect is due to the\nsuppression of membrane motion and dynamic shape deformations by a more viscous\ncytosol for $C=5$, resulting in a more compact cellular core of the flow in\ncomparison to $C=1$. The weak effect of cytosol viscosity on the flow\nresistance and RBC-FL explains why cells can have a high concentration of\nhemoglobin for efficient oxygen delivery, without a pronounced increase in the\nflow resistance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Mar 2020 16:18:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-23"}

Continuously understanding the state of\nour health and modeling how it evolves is essential if we wish to improve it.\nGiven the opportunity that people live with more data about their life today\nthan any other time in history, the challenge rests in interweaving this data\nwith the growing body of knowledge to compute and model the health state of an\nindividual continually. This dissertation presents an approach to build a\npersonal model and dynamically estimate the health state of an individual by\nfusing multi-modal data and domain knowledge. The system is stitched together\nfrom four essential abstraction elements: 1. the events in our life, 2. the\nlayers of our biological systems (from molecular to an organism), 3. the\nfunctional utilities that arise from biological underpinnings, and 4. how we\ninteract with these utilities in the reality of daily life. Connecting these\nfour elements via graph network blocks forms the backbone by which we\ninstantiate a digital twin of an individual. Edges and nodes in this graph\nstructure are then regularly updated with learning techniques as data is\ncontinuously digested. Experiments demonstrate the use of dense and\nheterogeneous real-world data from a variety of personal and environmental\nsensors to monitor individual cardiovascular health state. State estimation and\nindividual modeling is the fundamental basis to depart from disease-oriented\napproaches to a total health continuum paradigm. Precision in predicting health\nrequires understanding state trajectory.

Algal blooms are a coastal pollutant that is a cause of\nconcern. Many satellite data, such as MODIS, have been used to generate\nwater-quality products to detect the blooms such as chlorophyll a (Chl-a), a\nphotosynthesis index called fluorescence line height (FLH), and sea surface\ntemperature (SST). It is important to characterize the spatial and temporal\nvariations of these water quality products by using the mathematical models of\nthese products. However, for monitoring, pollution control boards will need\nnowcasts and forecasts of any pollution. Therefore, we aim to predict the\nfuture values of the MODIS Chl-a, FLH, and SST of the water. This will not be\nlimited to one type of water but, rather, will cover different types of water\nvarying in depth and turbidity. This is very significant because the temporal\ntrend of Chl-a, FLH, and SST is dependent on the geospatial and water\nproperties. For this purpose, we will decompose the time series of each pixel\ninto several components: trend, intra-annual variations, seasonal cycle, and\nstochastic stationary. We explore three such time series machine learning\nmodels that can characterize the non-stationary time series data and predict\nfuture values, including the Seasonal ARIMA (Auto Regressive Integrated Moving\nAverage) (SARIMA), regression, and neural network. The results indicate that\nall these methods are effective at modelling Chl-a, FLH, and SST time series\nand predicting the values reasonably well.

Such a reality triggered a lot of interest in modeling\nDRAM behavior for either predicting the errors in advance or for adjusting DRAM\ncircuit parameters to achieve a better trade-off between energy efficiency and\nreliability. Existing modeling efforts may have studied the impact of few\noperating parameters and temperature on DRAM reliability using custom FPGAs\nsetups, however they neglected the combined effect of workload-specific\nfeatures that can be systematically investigated only on a real system. In this\npaper, we present the results of our study on workload-dependent DRAM error\nbehavior within a real server considering various operating parameters, such as\nthe refresh rate, voltage and temperature. We show that the rate of single- and\nmulti-bit errors may vary across workloads by 8x, indicating that program\ninherent features can affect DRAM reliability significantly. Based on this\nobservation, we extract 249 features, such as the memory access rate, the rate\nof cache misses, the memory reuse time and data entropy, from various\ncompute-intensive, caching and analytics benchmarks. We apply several\nsupervised learning methods to construct the DRAM error behavior model for 72\nserver-grade DRAM chips using the memory operating parameters and extracted\nprogram inherent features. Our results show that, with an appropriate choice of\nprogram features and supervised learning method, the rate of single- and\nmulti-bit errors can be predicted for a specific DRAM module with an average\nerror of less than 10.5 %, as opposed to the 2.9x estimation error obtained for\na conventional workload-unaware error model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Mar 2020 05:09:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-30"}
