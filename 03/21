It is well-known that the linearized operator around the kink\nhas a simple kernel and no internal modes. However, it possesses an odd\nresonance at the bottom of the continuum spectrum, deeply related to the\nexistence of the (in)famous wobbling kink, an explicit periodic-in-time\nsolution of SG around the kink that contradicts the asymptotic stability of the\nkink in the energy space.\n  In this paper, we further investigate the influence of resonances in the\nasymptotic stability question.

By gathering\nB\\\"acklund transformations (BT) and Virial estimates around odd perturbations\nof the vacuum solution, we first identify the manifold of initial data around\nzero under which BTs are related to the wobbling kink solution.

Avoiding the use of inaccurate quality labels, we proposed\na novel concept to measure face quality based on an arbitrary face recognition\nmodel. By determining the embedding variations generated from random\nsubnetworks of a face model, the robustness of a sample representation and\nthus, its quality is estimated. The experiments are conducted in a\ncross-database evaluation setting on three publicly available databases.

Sequential BED, as opposed to static\nBED, considers the scenario where we can sequentially update our beliefs about\nthe model parameters through data gathered in the experiment. A class of models\nof particular interest for the natural and medical sciences are implicit\nmodels, where the data generating distribution is intractable, but sampling\nfrom it is possible. Even though there has been a lot of work on static BED for\nimplicit models in the past few years, the notoriously difficult problem of\nsequential BED for implicit models has barely been touched upon.

We propose an\napproach to the execution of a task plan that permits some adaptability to\nunexpected observations of the state while maintaining the validity of the plan\nthrough online reasoning.\n  Our approach computes an adaptable, partially-ordered plan from a given\ntotally-ordered plan. The partially-ordered plan is adaptable in that it can\nexploit beneficial differences between the world and what was expected. The\napproach is general in that it can be used with any task planner that produces\neither a totally or a partially-ordered plan.

The output of such systems is a set\nof augmented images and scoliosis related angles. These angles, however,\nconfuse the physicians due to their large number. Moreover, the lack of X-rays\nscans makes it impossible for the physician to compare RGB and X-rays images,\nand decide whether to reduce X-rays exposure or not. In this work, we exploit\nboth RGB images of scoliosis captured during clinical diagnosis, and X-rays\nhard copies provided by patients in order to register both images and give a\nrich comparison of diagnoses. The work consists in, first, establishing the\nmonomodal (RGB topography of the back) and multimodal (RGB and Xrays) image\ndatabase, then registering images based on patient landmarks, and finally\nblending registered images for a visual analysis and follow up by the\nphysician.

It is then natural to ask, can we harness the power of quantum noise\nthat is beneficial to quantum computing? An important current direction for\nquantum computing is its application to machine learning, such as\nclassification problems. One outstanding problem in machine learning for\nclassification is its sensitivity to adversarial examples. These are small,\nundetectable perturbations from the original data where the perturbed data is\ncompletely misclassified in otherwise extremely accurate classifiers. They can\nalso be considered as `worst-case' perturbations by unknown noise sources. We\nshow that by taking advantage of depolarisation noise in quantum circuits for\nclassification, a robustness bound against adversaries can be derived where the\nrobustness improves with increasing noise. This robustness property is\nintimately connected with an important security concept called differential\nprivacy which can be extended to quantum differential privacy. For the\nprotection of quantum data, this is the first quantum protocol that can be used\nagainst the most general adversaries. Furthermore, we show how the robustness\nin the classical case can be sensitive to the details of the classification\nmodel, but in the quantum case the details of classification model are absent,\nthus also providing a potential quantum advantage for classical data that is\nindependent of quantum speedups. This opens the opportunity to explore other\nways in which quantum noise can be used in our favour, as well as identifying\nother ways quantum algorithms can be helpful that is independent of quantum\nspeedups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Mar 2020 17:56:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-02"}

In this\nbrief note, we endeavour to assess the efficiency of quarantine measures by\nmeans of mathematical modelling. Instead of the classical SIR model, we\nintroduce a new model of infection progression under the assumption that all\ninfected individual are isolated after the incubation period in such a way that\nthey cannot infect other people. Disease progression in this model is\ndetermined by the basic reproduction number $\\mathcal{R}_0$ (the number of\nnewly infected individuals during the incubation period), which is different\ncompared to that for the standard SIR model. If $\\mathcal{R}_0 >1$, then the\nnumber of latently infected individuals exponentially grows. However, if\n$\\mathcal{R}_0 <1$ (e.g.~due to quarantine measures and contact restrictions\nimposed by public authorities), then the number of infected decays\nexponentially. We then consider the available data on the disease development\nin different countries to show that there are three possible patterns: growth\ndynamics, growth-decays dynamics, and patchy dynamics (growth-decay-growth).\nAnalysis of the data in China and Korea shows that the peak of infection\n(maximum of daily cases) is reached about 10 days after the restricting\nmeasures are introduced. During this period of time, the growth rate of the\ntotal number of infected was gradually decreasing. However, the growth rate\nremains exponential in Italy. Arguably, it suggests that the introduced\nquarantine is not sufficient and stricter measures are needed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Mar 2020 18:22:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-24"}

From hydrodynamic\nequations, in the assumption of a solution in the shape of a streamer, it is\npossible to derive several relations between streamer parameters, which form a\nsystem of algebraic equations (SAE). Because of the made approximations, the\nerror in the solution of this system is expected to be probably up to a few\ntens of percent. Solving the SAE allows us to express all streamer parameters\nin terms of the streamer length $L$, the constant uniform external electric\nfield $E_e$, and the streamer radius. The solutions with different radii are\nvalid solutions of the hydrodynamic equations, and are analogous to the\npropagation modes of flat-front perturbations with different transverse\nwavelengths. We interpret the streamer as a nonlinear instability, whose\nbehavior is determined by choosing the radius at which the velocity is\nmaximized, because, as we show, the velocity plays the same role as the\nexponential growth rate in the case of linear instabilities.\n  Thus, streamer behavior is unambiguously determined by $E_e$ and $L$, in a\nrelatively computationally economical way. In contrast, numerical methods of\nsolving the microscopic equations, such as hydrodynamic simulations, are more\ncomputationally demanding, and the preferred solution in them arises\nautomatically because of numerical fluctuations. The calculations for air at\nsea level conditions produce reasonable values for commonly observed streamer\nparameters. The calculated positive streamer velocities and negative threshold\nfields are compatible with experimental measurements. The physical reason for\nthe positive threshold fields is also discussed. A much simplified analytical\nmodel (Appendix B) reproduces many of the presented results, at least\nqualitatively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Mar 2020 18:33:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Aug 2020 20:53:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-01"}

Most studies of substructure evolution make predictions based on\nempirical models of tidal mass loss that are calibrated using numerical\nsimulations. This approach can be accurate in the cases considered, but lacks\ngenerality and does not provide a physical understanding of the processes\ninvolved. Recently, we demonstrated that truncating NFW distribution functions\nsharply in energy results in density profiles that resemble those of tidally\nstripped systems, offering a path to constructing physically motivated models\nof tidal mass loss. In this work, we review calculations of mass loss based on\nenergy truncation alone, and then consider what secondary effects may modulate\nmass loss beyond this. We find that a combination of dependence on additional\norbital parameters and variations in individual particle energies over an orbit\nresults in a less abrupt truncation in energy space as a subhalo loses mass.\nCombining the energy truncation approach with a simple prediction for the\nmass-loss rate, we construct a full model of mass loss that can accurately\npredict the evolution of a subhalo in terms of a single parameter $\\eta_{\\rm\neff}$. This parameter can be fully determined from the initial orbital and halo\nproperties, and does not require calibration with numerical simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Mar 2020 18:36:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-24"}

The ground-state phase diagram consists of two ferromagnetic and\nparamagnetic phases. It is known the magnetization in this spin system is\nnon-ergodic. We set up two different experiments as we call them single and\ndouble quenches and test the dynamics of the magnetization along the $Z$-axis\nand the spin-spin correlation function along the $X$-axis which are the order\nparameters of the zero-temperature phases . Our exact results reveal that for\nsingle quenches at zero-temperature, the ergodicity depends on the initial\nstate and the order parameter. Interestingly on the other setup, a double\nquench on a cyclic path, ergodicity is completely broken for starting from the\nphase corresponding to the order parameter. Otherwise, it depends on the first\nquenched point, and the quench time $T$ when the model spent before a second\nquench in the way back which gives an ability to controlling the ergodicity in\nthe system. Therefore, and contrary to expectations, in the mentioned model the\nergodicity can be observed with probing quench dynamics at zero-temperature.\nOur results provide further insight into the zero-temperature dynamical\nbehavior of quantum systems and their connections to the ergodicity phenomenon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Mar 2020 18:59:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 2020 06:47:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-15"}

One proposed set of methods is training surrogate\nexplainer models which approximate the more complex model. Explainer methods\nare generally classified as either local or global, depending on what portion\nof the data space they are purported to explain. The improved coverage of\nglobal explainers usually comes at the expense of explainer fidelity. One way\nof trading off the advantages of both approaches is to aggregate several local\nexplainers into a single explainer model with improved coverage. However, the\nproblem of aggregating these local explainers is computationally challenging,\nand existing methods only use heuristics to form these aggregations.\n  In this paper we propose a local explainer aggregation method which selects\nlocal explainers using non-convex optimization. In contrast to other heuristic\nmethods, we use an integer optimization framework to combine local explainers\ninto a near-global aggregate explainer. Our framework allows a decision-maker\nto directly tradeoff coverage and fidelity of the resulting aggregation through\nthe parameters of the optimization problem. We also propose a novel local\nexplainer algorithm based on information filtering.

Wave damping by sea ice is investigated by looking at the spatial\nattenuation coefficients.

Despite its success in many\ndomains, reinforcement learning is challenging to apply to problems with hard\nconstraints, especially if both the state variables and actions are\nconstrained. Previous works seeking to ensure constraint satisfaction, or\nsafety, have focused on adding a projection step to a learned policy. Yet, this\napproach requires solving an optimization problem at every policy execution\nstep, which can lead to significant computational costs.\n  To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a new approach, termed Vertex\nNetworks (VNs), with guarantees on safety during exploration and on learned\ncontrol policies by incorporating the safety constraints into the policy\nnetwork architecture. Leveraging the geometric property that all points within\na convex set can be represented as the convex combination of its vertices, the\nproposed algorithm first learns the convex combination weights and then uses\nthese weights along with the pre-calculated vertices to output an action. The\noutput action is guaranteed to be safe by construction. Numerical examples\nillustrate that the proposed VN algorithm outperforms vanilla reinforcement\nlearning in a variety of benchmark control tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Mar 2020 20:32:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-24"}

Using these\nhandles we study different approaches to distinguishing strange-quark from\ndown-quark jets, including single variable cut-based methods, a boosted\ndecision tree (BDT) with a small number of simple variables, and a deep\nlearning convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture with jet images. We\nshow that modest gains are possible from the CNN compared with the BDT or a\nsingle variable. Starting from jet samples with only strange-quark and\ndown-quark jets, the CNN algorithm can improve the strange to down ratio by a\nfactor of roughly 2 for strange tagging efficiencies below 0.2, and by a factor\nof 2.5 for strange tagging efficiencies near 0.02.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Mar 2020 22:16:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-24"}

Since the inception of da Costa's paraconsistent calculi $C_n$,\nalgebraic equivalents for such systems have been sought. It is known, however,\nthat these systems are not self-extensional (i.e., they do not satisfy the\nreplacement property). More than this, they are not algebraizable in the sense\nof Blok-Pigozzi. The same negative results hold for several systems of the\nhierarchy of paraconsistent logics known as Logics of Formal Inconsistency\n(LFIs). Because of this, several systems belonging to this class of logics are\nonly characterizable by semantics of a non-deterministic nature. This paper\noffers a solution for two open problems in the domain of paraconsistency, in\nparticular connected to algebraization of LFIs, by extending with rules several\nLFIs weaker than $C_1$ , thus obtaining the replacement property (that is, such\nLFIs turn out to be self-extensional). Moreover, these logics become\nalgebraizable in the standard Lindenbaum-Tarski's sense by a suitable variety\nof Boolean algebras extended with additional operations. The weakest LFI\nsatisfying replacement presented here is called RmbC, which is obtained from\nthe basic LFI called mbC. Some axiomatic extensions of RmbC are also studied.\nIn addition, a neighborhood semantics is defined for such systems. It is shown\nthat RmbC can be defined within the minimal bimodal non-normal logic E+E\ndefined by the fusion of the non-normal modal logic E with itself.

Replay is among the\nsimplest attacks to mount - yet difficult to detect reliably. The\ngeneralization failure of spoofing countermeasures (CMs) has driven the\ncommunity to study various alternative deep learning CMs. The majority of them\nare supervised approaches that learn a human-spoof discriminator. In this\npaper, we advocate a different, deep generative approach that leverages from\npowerful unsupervised manifold learning in classification. The potential\nbenefits include the possibility to sample new data, and to obtain insights to\nthe latent features of genuine and spoofed speech. To this end, we propose to\nuse variational autoencoders (VAEs) as an alternative backend for replay attack\ndetection, via three alternative models that differ in their\nclass-conditioning. The first one, similar to the use of Gaussian mixture\nmodels (GMMs) in spoof detection, is to train independently two VAEs - one for\neach class. The second one is to train a single conditional model (C-VAE) by\ninjecting a one-hot class label vector to the encoder and decoder networks. Our\nfinal proposal integrates an auxiliary classifier to guide the learning of the\nlatent space. Our experimental results using constant-Q cepstral coefficient\n(CQCC) features on the ASVspoof 2017 and 2019 physical access subtask datasets\nindicate that the C-VAE offers substantial improvement in comparison to\ntraining two separate VAEs for each class.

Via discrete dislocation dynamics and molecular dynamics simulations,\nwe investigate the strain rate and dislocation density dependence of the\nstrength of bulk copper single crystals using 192 simulations spanning over 10\norders of magnitude in strain rate and 9 orders of magnitude in dislocation\ndensity. Based on these large set of simulations and theoretical analysis, a\nnew analytical relationship between material strength, dislocation density,\nstrain rate and dislocation mobility is proposed, which is in excellent\nagreement with the current simulations as well as with experimental data. The\nresults show that the material strength is a non-monotonic function of\ndislocation density and displays two universal regimes (first decreasing, then\nincreasing) as the dislocation density increases. The first regime is a result\nof strain rate hardening, while the second regime is dominated by the classical\nTaylor forest hardening. Accordingly, the strength displays universally, as a\nfunction of strain rate, a rate-independent regime at low strain rates\n(governed by forest hardening) followed by a rate hardening regime at high\nstrain rates (governed by strain rate hardening). All the results can be\ncaptured by a single scaling function. Finally, the fluctuations of dislocation\nflow are analyzed in terms of the strain rate dependent distribution of\ndislocation segment velocities. It is found that the fluctuations are governed\nby another universal scaling function and diverge in the rate independent\nlimit, indicating a critical behavior.

Here, we experimentally demonstrate\na new technique of Raman enhancement driven by nonradiative energy transfer\n(NRET) achieving a $10$-fold enhancement in the Raman intensity in a vertical\nvdWH comprising of a monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide (1L-TMD) placed\non a multilayer SnSe\\tsub2. Consequently, several weak Raman peaks become\nvisible which are otherwise imperceptible. We also show a strong modulation of\nthe enhancement factor by tuning the spectral overlap between the 1L-TMD and\nSnSe\\tsub2 through temperature variation and the results are in remarkable\nagreement with a Raman polarizability model capturing the effect of NRET. The\nobserved NRET driven Raman enhancement is a novel mechanism which has not been\nexperimentally demonstrated thus far and is distinct from conventional surface\n(SERS), tip (TERS) or Interference enhanced Raman scattering (IERS) mechanisms\nthat are driven solely by charge transfer or electric field enhancement.

However, GCN-based models (GCNs) is an inherently coupled training\nframework repetitively conducting the complex neighboring aggregation, which\nleads to the limitation of flexibility in processing large-scale graph. With\nthe depth of layers increases, the computational and memory cost of GCNs grow\nexplosively due to the recursive neighborhood expansion. To tackle these\nissues, we present Node2Grids, a flexible uncoupled training framework that\nleverages the independent mapped data for obtaining the embedding. Instead of\ndirectly processing the coupled nodes as GCNs, Node2Grids supports a more\nefficacious method in practice, mapping the coupled graph data into the\nindependent grid-like data which can be fed into the efficient Convolutional\nNeural Network (CNN). This simple but valid strategy significantly saves memory\nand computational resource while achieving comparable results with the leading\nGCN-based models. Specifically, by ranking each node's influence through\ndegree, Node2Grids selects the most influential first-order as well as\nsecond-order neighbors with central node fusion information to construct the\ngrid-like data. For further improving the efficiency of downstream tasks, a\nsimple CNN-based neural network is employed to capture the significant\ninformation from the mapped grid-like data. Moreover, the grid-level attention\nmechanism is implemented, which enables implicitly specifying the different\nweights for neighboring nodes with different influences.

The approach is based on\ndesigning transformations of variables that simultaneously diagonalize (by\ncongruence) the equations' key operators and subsequently constructing\nparameter-robust block-diagonal preconditioners for the transformed system. Our\nmethodology is supported by theoretical considerations as well as by numerical\nresults.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Mar 2020 12:14:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 17 Oct 2020 10:17:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-20"}

Propagation angles are distinctly different from whistlers\nusually observed in the solar wind, and amplitudes are significantly larger.\nWaves occur most often in association with stream interaction regions (SIRs),\nand are often close-packed. 68 percent of the 54 SIRs had narrowband whistler\ngroups; 33 percent of the nine interplanetary coronal mass ejections had\ncoherent groups. Although wave occurrence as a function of the electron\ntemperature anisotropy and parallel beta is constrained by the thresholds for\nthe whistler temperature anisotropy and firehose instabilities, neither is\nconsistent with observed wave properties. We show for the first time that\ncomparisons of wave data to thresholds for the electron beam driven instability\n(beam speed greater than twice the electron Alfven speed) and to the whistler\nheat flux fan instability indicate that either might destabilize the narrowband\nwaves. In contrast, the less coherent waves, on average, are associated with\nzero or near zero heat flux and much higher electron Alfven speeds, without\nhigher energy beams. This suggests that the less coherent waves may be more\neffective in regulating the electron heat flux, or that the scattering and\nenergization of solar wind electrons by the narrowband waves results in\nbroadening of the waves. The highly oblique propagation and large amplitudes of\nboth the narrowband and less coherent whistlers enable resonant interactions\nwith electrons over a broad energy range, and, unlike parallel whistlers does\nnot require that the electrons and waves counter-propagate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Mar 2020 13:33:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Mar 2020 02:23:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-22"}

These results\nsignificantly improve existing theoretical analyses by providing the exact\ndistribution of a reduced minimizer and its Euclidean norm and by the general\nassumptions required on the problem. We validate our theoretical findings by\nextensive numerical testing of REGO with three types of global optimization\nsolvers, illustrating the improved scalability of REGO compared to the\nfull-dimensional application of the respective solvers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Mar 2020 14:45:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-24"}

As a result, camouflaging has typically been applied\nselectively, which can ultimately undermine its resilience. Here, we propose a\nlow-cost and generic scheme---full-chip camouflaging can be finally realized\nwithout reservations. Our scheme is based on obfuscating the interconnects,\ni.e., the back-end-of-line (BEOL), through design-time handling for real and\ndummy wires and vias. To that end, we implement custom, BEOL-centric\nobfuscation cells, and develop a CAD flow using industrial tools. Our scheme\ncan be applied to any design and technology node without FEOL-level\nmodifications. Considering its BEOL-centric nature, we advocate applying our\nscheme in conjunction with split manufacturing, to furthermore protect against\nuntrusted fabs. We evaluate our scheme for various designs at the physical,\nDRC-clean layout level. Our scheme incurs a significantly lower cost than most\nof the prior art. Notably, for fully camouflaged layouts, we observe average\npower, performance, and area overheads of 24.96%, 19.06%, and 32.55%,\nrespectively. We conduct a thorough security study addressing the threats\n(attacks) related to untrustworthy FEOL fabs (proximity attacks) and malicious\nend-users (SAT-based attacks). An empirical key finding is that only\nlarge-scale camouflaging schemes like ours are practically secure against\npowerful SAT-based attacks. Another key finding is that our scheme hinders both\nplacement- and routing-centric proximity attacks; correct connections are\nreduced by 7.47X, and complexity is increased by 24.15X, respectively, for such\nattacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Mar 2020 10:40:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-25"}

The feasibility of generating such nonclassical states\nhas been established in several branches of physics such as cavity\nelectrodynamics, trapped ions, quantum dots, atoms inside cavities and so on.\nIn this sense, we will discuss the issue of the generation of nonclassical\nstates in the context of a superconducting qubit in a microcavity. It has been\nrecently proposed a way to engineer quantum states using a SQUID charge qubit\ninside a cavity with a controllable interaction between the cavity field and\nthe charge qubit. The key ingredients to engineer these quantum states are a\ntunable gate voltage and a classical magnetic field applied to SQUID. Some\nmodels including these ingredients and using some appropriate approximations\nwhich allow for the linearization of the interaction and nonclassical states of\nthe field were generated. Since decoherence is known to affect quantum effects\nuninterruptedly and decoherence process are works even when the quantum state\nis being formed, therefore, it is interesting to envisage processes through\nwhich quantum superpositions are generated as fast as possible. The decoherence\neffect has been studied and quantified in the context of cavity QED where it is\nshown that the more quantum is the superposition, more rapidly the\nenvironmental effects occur during the process of creating the quantum state.\nIn the latter reference, we have succeeded in linearizing the Hamiltonian\nthrough the application of an appropriate unitary transformation and for\ncertain values of the parameters involved, we have showed that it is possible\nto obtain specific Hamiltonians.

It promises to push the frontier of scientific\ndiscovery beyond current limits. However, skeptics have worried that deep\nneural networks are black boxes, and have called into question whether these\nadvances can really be deemed scientific progress if humans cannot understand\nthem. Relatedly, these systems also possess bewildering new vulnerabilities:\nmost notably a susceptibility to \"adversarial examples\". In this paper, I argue\nthat adversarial examples will become a flashpoint of debate in philosophy and\ndiverse sciences. Specifically, new findings concerning adversarial examples\nhave challenged the consensus view that the networks' verdicts on these cases\nare caused by overfitting idiosyncratic noise in the training set, and may\ninstead be the result of detecting predictively useful \"intrinsic features of\nthe data geometry\" that humans cannot perceive (Ilyas et al., 2019). These\nresults should cause us to re-examine responses to one of the deepest puzzles\nat the intersection of philosophy and science: Nelson Goodman's \"new riddle\" of\ninduction. Specifically, they raise the possibility that progress in a number\nof sciences will depend upon the detection and manipulation of useful features\nthat humans find inscrutable. Before we can evaluate this possibility, however,\nwe must decide which (if any) of these inscrutable features are real but\navailable only to \"alien\" perception and cognition, and which are distinctive\nartifacts of deep learning-for artifacts like lens flares or Gibbs phenomena\ncan be similarly useful for prediction, but are usually seen as obstacles to\nscientific theorizing. Thus, machine learning researchers urgently need to\ndevelop a theory of artifacts for deep neural networks, and I conclude by\nsketching some initial directions for this area of research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Mar 2020 16:24:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-27"}

However, the tree-like shapes of neurons cannot be\ndescribed easily as points in a vector space (the subtraction of two neuronal\nshapes is not a meaningful operation), and methods from computational topology\nare better suited to their analysis. Here we introduce methods from Discrete\nMorse (DM) Theory to extract the tree-skeletons of individual neurons from\nvolumetric brain image data, and to summarize collections of neurons labelled\nby tracer injections. Since individual neurons are topologically trees, it is\nsensible to summarize the collection of neurons using a consensus tree-shape\nthat provides a richer information summary than the traditional regional\n'connectivity matrix' approach. The conceptually elegant DM approach lacks\nhand-tuned parameters and captures global properties of the data as opposed to\nprevious approaches which are inherently local. For individual skeletonization\nof sparsely labelled neurons we obtain substantial performance gains over\nstate-of-the-art non-topological methods (over 10% improvements in precision\nand faster proofreading).
