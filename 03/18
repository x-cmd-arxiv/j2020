Proper operative sea-land segmentation for remote sensing\nimages remains a challenging issue due to complex and diverse transition\nbetween sea and lands. Although several Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)\nhave been developed for sea-land segmentation, the performance of these CNNs is\nfar from the expected target. This paper presents a novel deep neural network\nstructure for pixel-wise sea-land segmentation, a Residual Dense U-Net\n(RDU-Net), in complex and high-density remote sensing images. RDU-Net is a\ncombination of both down-sampling and up-sampling paths to achieve satisfactory\nresults. In each down- and up-sampling path, in addition to the convolution\nlayers, several densely connected residual network blocks are proposed to\nsystematically aggregate multi-scale contextual information. Each dense network\nblock contains multilevel convolution layers, short-range connections and an\nidentity mapping connection which facilitates features re-use in the network\nand makes full use of the hierarchical features from the original images. These\nproposed blocks have a certain number of connections that are designed with\nshorter distance backpropagation between the layers and can significantly\nimprove segmentation results whilst minimizing computational costs. We have\nperformed extensive experiments on two real datasets Google Earth and ISPRS and\ncompare the proposed RDUNet against several variations of Dense Networks. The\nexperimental results show that RDUNet outperforms the other state-of-the-art\napproaches on the sea-land segmentation tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Mar 2020 16:00:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-18"}

The\nfocus is on the short term behavior and the time range considered covers about\neight dominant second-mode oscillations of the drop after it is formed. Due to\nthe small fluid inertia the growth of the drop is quasi-static and is well\ncaptured by the static pendant drop theory. Nevertheless, the pinching dynamics\nand the resulting post-formation state of the drop trigger a nonlinear\noscillation when the drop falls. The initial shape of the drop when it is just\nformed is decomposed into spherical harmonic modes. The pinching dynamics such\nas interface overturning introduces small-scale variation on the drop contour,\nwhich in turn contributes to the finite amplitudes of the higher-order modes.\nFurthermore, the initial kinetic energy when the droplet is just formed is as\nimportant as the initial surface energy contained in the drop shape, and is\nfound to amplify the initial oscillation amplitude and to induce a phase shift\nin the oscillation of all the modes. By incorporating both the initial surface\nand kinetic energy, the linear model for a free drop oscillation yields very\ngood predictions for the second and third modes. The mode amplitude spectra\nshow both the primary frequencies that are consistent with the Lamb's theory\nand the secondary frequencies arising from different modes due to nonlinear\ninter-mode coupling. The complex transient flow inside and outside the drop is\ninduced by the interaction between the falling motion and the nonlinear\noscillation. The streamlines indicate that the internal flow is substantially\ndifferent from the Hill vortex for a falling drop without oscillation. The\ntemporal evolutions of both the internal flow and the wake morphology follow\nthe dominant second oscillation mode.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Mar 2020 16:01:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-18"}

In the classic formulation of Art Gallery, G and C consist of all\nthe points within P. Other well-known variants restrict G and C to consist\neither of all the points on the boundary of P or of all the vertices of P.\nRecently, three new important discoveries were made: the above mentioned\nvariants of Art Gallery are all W[1]-hard with respect to k [Bonnet and\nMiltzow, ESA'16], the classic variant has an O(log k)-approximation algorithm\n[Bonnet and Miltzow, SoCG'17], and it may require irrational guards [Abrahamsen\net al., SoCG'17]. Building upon the third result, the classic variant and the\ncase where G consists only of all the points on the boundary of P were both\nshown to be \\exists R-complete~[Abrahamsen et al., STOC'18]. Even when both G\nand C consist only of all the points on the boundary of P, the problem is not\nknown to be in NP.\n  Given the first discovery, the following question was posed by Giannopoulos\n[Lorentz Center Workshop, 2016]: Is Art Gallery FPT with respect to r, the\nnumber of reflex vertices? We focus on the variant where G and C are all the\nvertices of P, called Vertex-Vertex Art Gallery. We show that Vertex-Vertex Art\nGallery is solvable in time r^{O(r^2)}n^{O(1)}.

For the DL ELHI\nextended with the bottom concept, we provide a characterization of the classes\nof OMQs that are fixed-parameter tractable. For its fragment EL extended with\ndomain and range restrictions and the bottom concept (which restricts the use\nof inverse roles), we provide a characterization of the classes of OMQs that\nare tractable in combined complexity. Both results are in terms of equivalence\nto OMQs of bounded tree width and rest on a reasonable assumption from\nparameterized complexity theory. They are similar in spirit to Grohe's seminal\ncharacterization of the tractable classes of conjunctive queries over\nrelational databases. We further study the complexity of the meta problem of\ndeciding whether a given OMQ is equivalent to an OMQ of bounded tree width,\nproviding several completeness results that range from NP to 2ExpTime,\ndepending on the DL used. We also consider the DL-Lite family of DLs, including\nmembers that admit functional roles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Mar 2020 16:32:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2020 15:25:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-30"}

Their brightness is determined by\nthe product of the solar illumination on the downward facing side of the panel\nmultiplied by the area of that side projected toward the observer on Earth.\nThis geometry leads to a unique brightness function that is not shared by other\nsatellites. For example, the observed brightness is very sensitive to the solar\nelevation angle. There are circumstances where sunlight only illuminates the\nupward facing side of the satellite rendering it invisible to Earth-based\nobservers. A brightness model depending on the solar aspect and the observer\naspect of the flat panel, in addition to the satellite distance, is described.\nAbsolute brightness is the only free parameter of the model, and it is taken to\nbe that at a distance of 1,000 km when the solar and observer factors are\nunity. This model has been successfully fitted to a set of observed magnitudes.\nThe absolute visual magnitude of a Starlink satellite as determined from this\nfitting is 4.1 +/- 0.1.

This paper focuses on the\nSpectral Energy Distribution (SED) obtained in 2017 February-March, when GRS\n1716-249 was in a bright hard spectral state. The soft gamma-ray data collected\nwith the INTEGRAL/SPI telescope show the presence of a spectral component which\nis in excess of the thermal Comptonisation emission. This component is usually\ninterpreted as inverse Compton emission from a tiny fraction of non-thermal\nelectrons in the X-ray corona. We find that hybrid thermal/non-thermal\nComptonisation models provide a good fit to the X/gamma-ray spectrum of GRS\n1716-249. The best-fit parameters are typical of the bright hard state spectra\nobserved in other black hole X-ray binaries. Moreover, the magnetised hybrid\nComptonisation model BELM provides an upper limit on the intensity of the\ncoronal magnetic field of about 1E+06 G. Alternatively, this soft gamma-ray\nemission could originate from synchrotron emission in the radio jet. In order\nto test this hypothesis, we fit the SED with the irradiated disc plus\nComptonisation model combined with the jet internal shock emission model ISHEM.\nWe found that a jet with an electron distribution of p~2.1 can reproduce the\nsoft gamma-ray emission of GRS 1716-249. However, if we introduce the expected\ncooling break around 10 keV, the jet model can no longer explain the observed\nsoft gamma-ray emission, unless the index of the electron energy distribution\nis significantly harder (p<2).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Mar 2020 17:16:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-18"}

Aerodynamic behavior of a DU 91-W2-250 wind profile undergoing\nlight dynamic stall is thus analyzed in a wind tunnel. Effects of a gust with\nstreamwise and spanwise periodic variation are investigated by comparing total\nand local lift generation with flow formation above the airfoil.

The aerodynamic response of the airfoil shows a delay of about\n$1/8$ period between evolution of local angle of attack and lift giving a\ncounterclockwise dynamic polar.

This is\ndifferent than batch normalization (BN), which is widely-adopted in Computer\nVision. The preferred use of LN in NLP is principally due to the empirical\nobservation that a (naive/vanilla) use of BN leads to significant performance\ndegradation for NLP tasks; however, a thorough understanding of the underlying\nreasons for this is not always evident. In this paper, we perform a systematic\nstudy of NLP transformer models to understand why BN has a poor performance, as\ncompared to LN. We find that the statistics of NLP data across the batch\ndimension exhibit large fluctuations throughout training. This results in\ninstability, if BN is naively implemented. To address this, we propose Power\nNormalization (PN), a novel normalization scheme that resolves this issue by\n(i) relaxing zero-mean normalization in BN, (ii) incorporating a running\nquadratic mean instead of per batch statistics to stabilize fluctuations, and\n(iii) using an approximate backpropagation for incorporating the running\nstatistics in the forward pass. We show theoretically, under mild assumptions,\nthat PN leads to a smaller Lipschitz constant for the loss, compared with BN.\nFurthermore, we prove that the approximate backpropagation scheme leads to\nbounded gradients. We extensively test PN for transformers on a range of NLP\ntasks, and we show that it significantly outperforms both LN and BN.

Interested in exploring this\ninterplay between color and structure, we study the scientific problem of\nidentifying and preserving the most informative image structures while\nconstraining the color space to just a few bits, such that the resulting image\ncan be recognized with possibly high accuracy. To this end, we propose a color\nquantization network, ColorCNN, which learns to structure the images from the\nclassification loss in an end-to-end manner. Given a color space size, ColorCNN\nquantizes colors in the original image by generating a color index map and an\nRGB color palette.

However, they can recreate training\nimages faithfully despite image degradation in the form of blur, noise, and\ncompression, generating similarly degraded images. To solve this problem, the\nrecently proposed noise robust GAN (NR-GAN) provides a partial solution by\ndemonstrating the ability to learn a clean image generator directly from noisy\nimages using a two-generator model comprising image and noise generators.\nHowever, its application is limited to noise, which is relatively easy to\ndecompose owing to its additive and reversible characteristics, and its\napplication to irreversible image degradation, in the form of blur,\ncompression, and combination of all, remains a challenge. To address these\nproblems, we propose blur, noise, and compression robust GAN (BNCR-GAN) that\ncan learn a clean image generator directly from degraded images without\nknowledge of degradation parameters (e.g., blur kernel types, noise amounts, or\nquality factor values). Inspired by NR-GAN, BNCR-GAN uses a multiple-generator\nmodel composed of image, blur-kernel, noise, and quality-factor generators.\nHowever, in contrast to NR-GAN, to address irreversible characteristics, we\nintroduce masking architectures adjusting degradation strength values in a\ndata-driven manner using bypasses before and after degradation. Furthermore, to\nsuppress uncertainty caused by the combination of blur, noise, and compression,\nwe introduce adaptive consistency losses imposing consistency between\nirreversible degradation processes according to the degradation strengths.

This reduces computation complexity\nand allows performing attention within a larger or even global region. In\ncompanion, we also propose a position-sensitive self-attention design.\nCombining both yields our position-sensitive axial-attention layer, a novel\nbuilding block that one could stack to form axial-attention models for image\nclassification and dense prediction.

In addition to the requirement of a fine-tuned impact,\ntrue polar wander, or partial freezing of the subsurface ocean, a further issue\nwith these hypotheses is that the `tiger stripes' may be short-lived.

The predominant method for\nmonitoring convergence is to run multiple chains and monitor individual chains'\ncharacteristics and compare these to the population as a whole: if within-chain\nand between-chain summaries are comparable, then this is taken to indicate that\nthe chains have converged to a common stationary distribution. Here, we\nintroduce a new method for diagnosing convergence based on how well a machine\nlearning classifier model can successfully discriminate the individual chains.\nWe call this convergence measure $R^*$. In contrast to the predominant\n$\\widehat{R}$, $R^*$ is a single statistic across all parameters that indicates\nlack of mixing, although individual variables' importance for this metric can\nalso be determined. Additionally, $R^*$ is not based on any single\ncharacteristic of the sampling distribution; instead it uses all the\ninformation in the chain, including that given by the joint sampling\ndistribution, which is currently largely overlooked by existing approaches. We\nrecommend calculating $R^*$ using two different machine learning classifiers -\ngradient-boosted regression trees and random forests - which each work well in\nmodels of different dimensions.

The proposed reason for\nthis conundrum is that NLR models can give predictions much worse than LR when\ngiven input data which lie outside the domain used in model training.\nContinuous unbounded variables are widely used in environmental sciences,\nwhence not uncommon for new input data to lie far outside the training domain.\nFor six environmental datasets, inputs in the test data were classified as\n\"outliers\" and \"non-outliers\" based on the Mahalanobis distance from the\ntraining input data. The prediction scores (mean absolute error, Spearman\ncorrelation) showed NLR to outperform LR for the non-outliers, but often\nunderperform LR for the outliers. An approach based on Occam's Razor (OR) was\nproposed, where linear extrapolation was used instead of nonlinear\nextrapolation for the outliers. The linear extrapolation to the outlier domain\nwas based on the NLR model within the non-outlier domain. This\nNLR$_{\\mathrm{OR}}$ approach reduced occurrences of very poor extrapolation by\nNLR, and it tended to outperform NLR and LR for the outliers. In conclusion,\ninput test data should be screened for outliers. For outliers, the unreliable\nNLR predictions can be replaced by NLR$_{\\mathrm{OR}}$ or LR predictions, or by\nissuing a \"no reliable prediction\" warning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Mar 2020 20:28:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-19"}

However, since the faces in these datasets usually contain\nlimited degree and types of variation, the resulting trained models generalize\npoorly to more realistic unconstrained face datasets. While collecting labeled\nfaces with larger variations could be helpful, it is practically infeasible due\nto privacy and labor cost. In comparison, it is easier to acquire a large\nnumber of unlabeled faces from different domains, which could be used to\nregularize the learning of face representations.

Together\nwith locally scale invariant potential terms in a classical action, this gauge\ncondition generates a Higgs potential whose vacuum expectation value (VEV)\nproduces the Einstein-Hilbert action with an $R^2$ term in the lowest level of\napproximation. One interesting aspect in this model is that a massless\nNambu-Goldstone boson associated with a scale invariance is absorbed into the\nmetric tensor field and consequently an $R^2$ term is induced in the action.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Mar 2020 21:17:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-19"}

However, applying data-driven\ninference to nonlinear loop invariants is challenging due to the large numbers\nof and magnitudes of high-order terms, the potential for overfitting on a small\nnumber of samples, and the large space of possible inequality bounds.\n  In this paper, we introduce a new neural architecture for general SMT\nlearning, the Gated Continuous Logic Network (G-CLN), and apply it to nonlinear\nloop invariant learning. G-CLNs extend the Continuous Logic Network (CLN)\narchitecture with gating units and dropout, which allow the model to robustly\nlearn general invariants over large numbers of terms. To address overfitting\nthat arises from finite program sampling, we introduce fractional sampling---a\nsound relaxation of loop semantics to continuous functions that facilitates\nunbounded sampling on real domain. We additionally design a new CLN activation\nfunction, the Piecewise Biased Quadratic Unit (PBQU), for naturally learning\ntight inequality bounds.\n  We incorporate these methods into a nonlinear loop invariant inference system\nthat can learn general nonlinear loop invariants.

The principal observes the evolution of a Markov\nchain that has two states, one \"good\" and one \"bad\" absorbing state, and has to\ndecide how to sequentially disclose information to the detector. The detector's\nonly information consists of the messages she receives from the principal. The\ndetector's objective is to detect as accurately as possible the time of the\njump from the good to the bad state. The principal's objective is to delay the\ndetector as much as possible from detective the jump to the bad state. For this\nsetting, we determine the optimal strategies of the principal and the detector.\nThe detector's optimal strategy is described by time-varying thresholds on her\nposterior belief of the good state.

Some of the\nwell known drawbacks implied by this method involves lack of thermodynamic\nconsistency and impossibility to control the surface tension independently. In\norder to correct these deficiencies, different approaches were developed in the\nliterature, such as multirange interactions potential, which involves larger\nstencils than nearest-neighbor approach, and modified forcing schemes. In this\nwork, a strategy is developed to control the liquid-gas density ratio and the\nsurface tension by means of an appropriate interaction force field using only\nnearest-neighbor interactions. The proposed procedure is devised starting from\nthe desired pressure tensor, which allow for the control of the equilibrium\nmultiphase properties such as liquid-gas coexistence curve and surface tension.\nThen, it is shown how to derive an external force field able to replicate the\neffects of this pressure tensor in the macroscopic conservation equations. The\nfinal step of our procedure is implementing this external force in the LBE by\nusing the classical Guo forcing scheme. Numerical tests regarding static and\ndynamic flow conditions were performed. Results obtained from simulations\nshowed good agreement with expected analytical values.

In this work, we take the first\nstride in studying adversarial transferability in wearable sensor systems from\nthe following perspectives: 1) transferability between machine learning\nsystems, 2) transferability across subjects, 3) transferability across sensor\nbody locations, and 4) transferability across datasets. We found strong\nuntargeted transferability in most cases. Targeted attacks were less successful\nwith success scores from $0\\%$ to $80\\%$. The transferability of adversarial\nexamples depends on many factors such as the inclusion of data from all\nsubjects, sensor body position, number of samples in the dataset, type of\nlearning algorithm, and the distribution of source and target system dataset.\nThe transferability of adversarial examples decreases sharply when the data\ndistribution of the source and target system becomes more distinct. We also\nprovide guidelines for the community for designing robust sensor systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Mar 2020 23:19:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Jul 2021 16:10:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-16"}

Tether operation depends on plasma density and magnetic field\n$\\mathbf{B}$, though tethers can deal with ill-defined density profiles, with\nthe anodic segment self-adjusting to accommodate densities. Planetary magnetic\nfields are due to currents in some small volume inside the planet,\nmagnetic-moment vector, and typically a dipole law approximation --- which\ndescribes the field outside. When compared with Saturn and Jupiter, the\nNeptunian magnetic structure is significantly more complex: the dipole is\nlocated below the equatorial plane, is highly offset from the planet center,\nand at large tilt with its rotation axis. Lorentz-drag work decreases quickly\nwith distance, thus requiring spacecraft periapsis at capture close to the\nplanet and allowing the large offset to make capture efficiency\n(spacecraft-to-tether mass ratio) well above a no-offset case. The S/C might\noptimally reach periapsis when crossing the meridian plane of the dipole, with\nthe S/C facing it; this convenient synchronism is eased by Neptune rotating\nlittle during capture.

There are\nalso Cartesian product relations for which every triple formed by the Cartesian\nproduct of applicable subjects and objects is a true fact. Link prediction on\nthe aforementioned relations is easy and can be achieved with even better\naccuracy using straightforward rules instead of sophisticated embedding models.\nA more fundamental defect of these models is that the link prediction scenario,\ngiven such data, is non-existent in the real-world.

For human pose estimation, joint obstructions and overlapping upon\nhuman bodies result in departed pose estimation. To address these problems, by\nintegrating priors of the structure of human bodies, we present a novel\nstructure-aware network to discreetly consider such priors during the training\nof the network. Typically, learning such constraints is a challenging task.\nInstead, we propose generative adversarial networks as our learning model in\nwhich we design two residual multiple instance learning (MIL) models with the\nidentical architecture, one is used as the generator and the other one is used\nas the discriminator. The discriminator task is to distinguish the actual poses\nfrom the fake ones. If the pose generator generates the results that the\ndiscriminator is not able to distinguish from the real ones, the model has\nsuccessfully learnt the priors. In the proposed model, the discriminator\ndifferentiates the ground-truth heatmaps from the generated ones, and later the\nadversarial loss back-propagates to the generator. Such procedure assists the\ngenerator to learn reasonable body configurations and is proved to be\nadvantageous to improve the pose estimation accuracy. Meanwhile, we propose a\nnovel function for MIL. It is an adjustable structure for both instance\nselection and modeling to appropriately pass the information between instances\nin a single bag. In the proposed residual MIL neural network, the pooling\naction adequately updates the instance contribution to its bag. The proposed\nadversarial residual multi-instance neural network that is based on pooling has\nbeen validated on two datasets for the human pose estimation task and\nsuccessfully outperforms the other state-of-arts models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Mar 2020 01:22:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-19"}

A minimal gate geometry without explicit tunnel barrier\ngates is introduced, and used to define a chain of accumulation mode quantum\ndots, each controlled by a single gate voltage. One-dimensional potentials are\nderived from a three-dimensional electrostatic model, and used to construct an\neffective Hamiltonian for efficient simulation. Control pulse sequences are\ndesigned by maintaining a fixed adiabaticity, so that different shuttling\nconditions can be systematically compared. We first use these tools to optimize\nthe device geometry for maximum transport velocity, considering only orbital\nstates and neglecting valley and spin degrees of freedom. Taking realistic\ngeometrical constraints into account, charge shuttling speeds up to $\\sim$300\nm/s preserve adiabaticity. Coherent spin transport is simulated by including\nspin-orbit and valley terms in an effective Hamiltonian, shuttling one member\nof a singlet pair and tracking the entanglement fidelity. With realistic device\nand material parameters, shuttle speeds in the range 10-100 m/s with high spin\nentanglement fidelities are obtained when the tunneling energy exceeds the\nZeeman energy. High fidelity also requires the inter-dot valley phase\ndifference to be below a threshold determined by the ratio of tunneling and\nZeeman energies, so that spin-valley-orbit mixing is weak. In this regime, we\nfind that the primary source of infidelity is a coherent spin rotation that is\ncorrectable, in principle. The results pertain to proposals for large-scale\nspin qubit processors in isotopically purified silicon that rely on coherent\nshuttling of spins to rapidly distribute quantum information between\ncomputational nodes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Mar 2020 02:36:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Apr 2020 16:48:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 29 Dec 2020 17:21:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-01"}

The\naim of video tracking is to extract the trajectories of a target or object of\ninterest, i.e. accurately locate a moving target in a video sequence and\ndiscriminate target from non-targets in the feature space of the sequence. So,\nfeature descriptors can have significant effects on such discrimination. In\nthis paper, we use the basic idea of many trackers which consists of three main\ncomponents of the reference model, i.e., object modeling, object detection and\nlocalization, and model updating. However, there are major improvements in our\nsystem. Our forth component, occlusion handling, utilizes the r-spatiogram to\ndetect the best target candidate. While spatiogram contains some moments upon\nthe coordinates of the pixels, r-spatiogram computes region-based compactness\non the distribution of the given feature in the image that captures richer\nfeatures to represent the objects. The proposed research develops an efficient\nand robust way to keep tracking the object throughout video sequences in the\npresence of significant appearance variations and severe occlusions.

In\nthe quantized theory, these charges act trivially on particle states belonging\nto the in/out vacuum Fock space.

In this scheme, the electron beam produced in a\nphotocathode radio-frequency (rf) gun first expands under its own Coulomb force\nwith which a positive energy chirp is imprinted in the beam longitudinal phase\nspace. The beam is then sent through a double bend achromat with positive\nlongitudinal dispersion where electrons at the bunch tail with lower energies\nfollow shorter paths and thus catch up with the bunch head, leading to\nlongitudinal bunch compression. We show that with optimized parameter sets, the\nwhole beam path from the electron source to the compression point can be made\nisochronous such that the time of flight for the electron beam is immune to the\nfluctuations of rf amplitude.

In contrast, we design a\nnew approach to detect presentation attacks from multiple frames based on two\ninsights: 1) detailed discriminative clues (e.g., spatial gradient magnitude)\nbetween living and spoofing face may be discarded through stacked vanilla\nconvolutions, and 2) the dynamics of 3D moving faces provide important clues in\ndetecting the spoofing faces.

ATs then transfer the concept of the body parts to the MTs via\noptimizing the MT parameters to identify part-relevant channels from the\nbackbone model.

With the aid of the\nlearned high-quality parameters, MTs can independently extract semantically\naligned part-level features from relevant channels in the testing stage. MPN\nhas three key advantages: 1) it does not need to conduct body part detection in\nthe inference stage; 2) its model is very compact and efficient for both\ntraining and testing; 3) in the training stage, it requires only coarse priors\nof body part locations, which are easy to obtain. Systematic experiments on\nfour large-scale ReID databases demonstrate that MPN consistently outperforms\nstate-of-the-art approaches by significant margins.

In this letter, we presented a prominence observed by New Vacuum\nSolar Telescope (NVST) in H-alpha wavelength. Knots that rose within the\nprominence appear to have been preferentially located at higher altitude,\nwhereas those that fell were found throughout the entire prominence structure.\nThe descending speed of the knots near the solar surface was higher than that\nfar away from the solar surface. We noted that the knots near the solar surface\nmay run along a set of coronal loops observed from the Atmospheric Imaging\nAssembly. Elsewhere, the majority of knots are interpreted to have descended\nacross more horizontal magnetic field with a nearly constant speed. This lack\nof acceleration indicates that the liberated gravitational potential energy may\nnot manifest as an increase in kinetic energy. Assuming instead that the\ndescending knots were capable of exciting Alfven waves that could then\ndissipate within the local corona, the gravitational potential energy of the\nknots may have been converted into thermal energy.

The performance of\nLSTM model will decrease sharply if the noise unseen data is distributed\neverywhere in the test suite. As code has free naming conventions, it is common\nfor a model trained on one project to encounter many unknown words on another\nproject.

The expected increase in the number of simultaneous collisions at\nthe HL-LHC and the resulting high detector occupancy will make track\nreconstruction algorithms extremely demanding in terms of time and computing\nresources. The increase in number of hits will increase the complexity of track\nreconstruction algorithms. In addition, the ambiguity in assigning hits to\nparticle tracks will be increased due to the finite resolution of the detector\nand the physical closeness of the hits. Thus, the reconstruction of charged\nparticle tracks will be a major challenge to the correct interpretation of the\nHL-LHC data. Most methods currently in use are based on Kalman filters which\nare shown to be robust and to provide good physics performance. However, they\nare expected to scale worse than quadratically. Designing an algorithm capable\nof reducing the combinatorial background at the hit level, would provide a much\ncleaner initial seed to the Kalman filter, strongly reducing the total\nprocessing time.

The bulk-edge correspondence,\nwidely-adopted in experiments to determine the band topology from edge\nproperties, however, becomes inadequate in discerning various topological\ncrystalline phases [7-17], leading to great challenges in the experimental\nclassification of the large family of topological crystalline materials [4-6].\nTheories predict that disclinations, ubiquitous crystallographic defects,\nprovide an effective probe of crystalline topology beyond edges [18-21], which,\nhowever, has not yet been confirmed in experiments. Here, we report the\nexperimental discovery of the bulk-disclination correspondence which is\nmanifested as the fractional spectral charge and robust bound states at the\ndisclinations. The fractional disclination charge originates from the\nsymmetry-protected bulk charge patterns---a fundamental property of many\ntopological crystalline insulators (TCIs). Meanwhile, the robust bound states\nat disclinations emerge as a secondary, but directly observable property of\nTCIs. Using reconfigurable photonic crystals as photonic TCIs with higher-order\ntopology, we observe those hallmark features via pump-probe and near-field\ndetection measurements. Both the fractional charge and the localized states are\ndemonstrated to emerge at the disclination in the TCI phase but vanish in the\ntrivial phase. The experimental discovery of bulk-disclination correspondence\nunveils a novel fundamental phenomenon and a new paradigm for exploring\ntopological materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Mar 2020 10:41:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Mar 2020 22:30:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 14 Sep 2020 03:23:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-26"}

In this paper, we go beyond the\napproach of classical \\acf{RL} and provide our agent with intrinsic motivation\nusing empowerment. In contrast to self-empowerment, a robot employing our\napproach strives for the empowerment of people in its environment, so they are\nnot disturbed by the robot's presence and motion. In our experiments, we show\nthat our approach has a positive influence on humans, as it minimizes its\ndistance to humans and thus decreases human travel time while moving\nefficiently towards its own goal. An interactive user-study shows that our\nmethod is considered more social than other state-of-the-art approaches by the\nparticipants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Mar 2020 11:16:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 21 Mar 2020 13:13:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 5 Aug 2020 11:49:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-06"}

In this paper, we propose a novel\nframework by learning high-order relation and topology information for\ndiscriminative features and robust alignment. At first, we use a CNN backbone\nand a key-points estimation model to extract semantic local features. Even so,\noccluded images still suffer from occlusion and outliers. Then, we view the\nlocal features of an image as nodes of a graph and propose an adaptive\ndirection graph convolutional (ADGC)layer to pass relation information between\nnodes. The proposed ADGC layer can automatically suppress the message-passing\nof meaningless features by dynamically learning di-rection and degree of\nlinkage. When aligning two groups of local features from two images, we view it\nas a graph matching problem and propose a cross-graph embedded-alignment (CGEA)\nlayer to jointly learn and embed topology information to local features, and\nstraightly predict similarity score. The proposed CGEA layer not only take full\nuse of alignment learned by graph matching but also re-place sensitive\none-to-one matching with a robust soft one.

It is well known that in the finite dimensional\ncase the H-infinity norm of a transfer function can be computed using the\nconnections between the corresponding singular value curves and the imaginary\naxis eigenvalues of a Hamiltonian matrix, leading to the established level set\nmethods. We show a similar connection between the transfer function of a\ntime-delay system and the imaginary axis eigenvalues of an infinite dimensional\nlinear operator $\\mathcal{L}_{\\xi}^N$.

In this study we discuss recent observational results in the\ncontext of hydrodynamical simulations in order to infer the properties of a\nputative embedded planet in the cavity of a transition disk. We imaged the\ntransition disk SR 21 in H-band in scattered light with SPHERE/IRDIS and in\nthermal dust emission with ALMA band 3 (3mm) observations at a spatial\nresolution of 0.1\". We combine these datasets with existing band 9 (430um) and\nband 7 (870um) ALMA continuum data. The Band 3 continuum data reveals a large\ncavity and a bright ring peaking at 53 au strongly suggestive of dust\ntrapping.The ring shows a pronounced azimuthal asymmetry, with a bright region\nin the north-west that we interpret as a dust over-density. A\nsimilarly-asymmetric ring is revealed at the same location in polarized\nscattered light, in addition to a set of bright spirals inside the mm cavity\nand a fainter spiral bridging the gap to the outer ring. These features are\nconsistent with a number of previous hydrodynamical models of planet-disk\ninteractions, and suggest the presence of a ~1 MJup planet at 44 au and\nPA=11{\\deg}. This makes SR21 the first disk showing spiral arms inside the mm\ncavity, as well as one for which the location of a putative planet can be\nprecisely inferred.

When using discrete objects as input to neural networks, we\noften ignore the underlying structures (e.g., natural groupings and\nsimilarities) and embed the objects independently into individual vectors. As a\nresult, existing methods do not scale to large vocabulary sizes. In this paper,\nwe design a simple and efficient embedding algorithm that learns a small set of\nanchor embeddings and a sparse transformation matrix. We call our method Anchor\n& Transform (ANT) as the embeddings of discrete objects are a sparse linear\ncombination of the anchors, weighted according to the transformation matrix.\nANT is scalable, flexible, and end-to-end trainable.

The photoluminescence intensity\nand optical orientation of electrons contributing to the H-band are studied by\nmeans of continuous wave and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy and\ntime-resolved Kerr rotation. It is shown that the H-band is due to\nrecombination of the heavy holes localized at the heterointerface with\nphotoexcited electrons attracted to the heterointerface from the GaAs layer.\nTwo lines with significantly different decay times constitute the H-band: a\nshort-lived high-energy one and a long-lived low-energy one. The high-energy\nline originates from recombination of electrons freely moving along the\nstructure plane, while the low-energy one is due to recombination of\ndonor-bound electrons near the interface. Application of the lateral electric\nfield of ~ 100-200 V/cm results in a quenching of both lines. This quenching is\ndue to a decrease of electron concentration near the heterointerface as a\nresult of a photocurrent-induced heating of electrons in the GaAs layer. On the\ncontrary, electrons near the heterointerface are effectively cooled, so the\ndonors near the interface are not completely empty up to ~ 100 V/cm, which is\nin stark contrast with the case of bulk materials. The optical spin\npolarization of the donor-bound electrons near the heterointerface weakly\ndepends on the electric field.

It relies on solving fluid\nequations on an Eulerian fluid grid and interpolating the resulting velocity\nback onto immersed structures. To resolve slender fibers, the grid spacing must\nbe on the order of the fiber radius, and thus the number of required grid\npoints along the filament must be of the same order as the aspect ratio.\nSimulations of slender bodies using the IB method can therefore be intractable.\nA technique is presented to address this problem in the context of Stokes flow.\nThe velocity of the structure is split into a component coming from the\nunderlying fluid grid, which is coarser than normally required, and a component\nproportional to the force (a drag term). The drag coefficient is set so that a\nsingle sphere is represented exactly on a grid of arbitrary meshwidth. Implicit\ntreatment of the drag term removes some of the stability restrictions normally\nassociated with the IB method. This comes at a loss of accuracy, although tests\nare conducted that show 1-2 digits of relative accuracy can be obtained on\ncoarser grids.

We demonstrate the use of\nthese partially diagrammatic methods by deriving a permutation condition for\ncomputing the output of any N-channel switch of CDPCs, we then use that\ncondition to prove that amongst all possible terms, the interference terms\nassociated to cyclic permutations of the N channels are the\ninformation-transmitting terms with maximum normalisation\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Mar 2020 13:56:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2020 22:34:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 6 Sep 2021 01:03:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-07"}

The first one is the appearance of\ntwo-terminal conductance plateaus at rational fractions of $e^2/h$. We explain\nhow this phenomenon, previously believed to be possible only in systems with\nstrong repulsive interactions, can be stabilized in a system with attraction in\nthe presence of the modulation. Using our theoretical framework we find the\nplateau amplitude and shape, and characterize the correlated phase which\ndevelops in the system due to the partial gap, namely a Luttinger liquid of\nelectronic trions. The second observation is a sharp conductance dip below a\nconductance of $1\\times e^2/h$, which changes its value over a wide range when\ntuning the system. We theorize that it is due to resonant backscattering caused\nby a periodic spin-orbit field. The behavior of this dip can be reliably\naccounted for by considering the finite length of the electronic waveguides, as\nwell as the interactions therein.

Streming potential is the contribution due\nto the water flux in the subsurface and is of particular interest in\nhydrogeophysics and reservoir characterization. Being able to estimate water\nfluxes in porous and fractured media using streaming potential data relies on\nour understanding of the electrokinetic coupling at the mineral-solution\ninterface and our capacity to understand, model, and upscale this phenomenon.\nTwo main approaches have been proposed to predict streaming potential\ngeneration in geological media. One of these approaches is based on determining\nthe excess charge which is effectively dragged in the medium by water flow. In\nthis chapter, we describe how to model the streaming potential by considering\nthis effective excess charge density, how it can be defined, calculated and\nupscaled. We provide a short overview of the theoretical basis of this approach\nand we describe different applications to both water saturated and partially\nsaturated soils and fractured media.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Mar 2020 14:35:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-19"}

Although Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)\nhave been successfully applied to graph classification tasks, most of them\noverlook the scarcity of labeled graph data in many applications. For example,\nin bioinformatics, obtaining protein graph labels usually needs laborious\nexperiments. Recently, few-shot learning has been explored to alleviate this\nproblem with only given a few labeled graph samples of test classes. The shared\nsub-structures between training classes and test classes are essential in\nfew-shot graph classification. Exiting methods assume that the test classes\nbelong to the same set of super-classes clustered from training classes.\nHowever, according to our observations, the label spaces of training classes\nand test classes usually do not overlap in real-world scenario. As a result,\nthe existing methods don't well capture the local structures of unseen test\nclasses. To overcome the limitation, in this paper, we propose a direct method\nto capture the sub-structures with well initialized meta-learner within a few\nadaptation steps. More specifically, (1) we propose a novel framework\nconsisting of a graph meta-learner, which uses GNNs based modules for fast\nadaptation on graph data, and a step controller for the robustness and\ngeneralization of meta-learner; (2) we provide quantitative analysis for the\nframework and give a graph-dependent upper bound of the generalization error\nbased on our framework; (3) the extensive experiments on real-world datasets\ndemonstrate that our framework gets state-of-the-art results on several\nfew-shot graph classification tasks compared to baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Mar 2020 14:38:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2020 06:22:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-24"}

Conventionally\nthese models have quadratic sufficient statistics and consequently capture\ncorrelations arising from pairwise interactions. In this work we study\nextensions of these to models with higher-order sufficient statistics, modeling\nbehavior on a social network with peer-group effects. In particular, we model\nbinary outcomes on a network as a higher-order spin glass, where the behavior\nof an individual depends on a linear function of their own vector of covariates\nand some polynomial function of the behavior of others, capturing peer-group\neffects. Using a {\\em single}, high-dimensional sample from such model our goal\nis to recover the coefficients of the linear function as well as the strength\nof the peer-group effects.

Currently, there is a great deal of interest in the\ntwo-dimensional (2D) pn junction. Although many experiments have demonstrated\nthe working principle, there is a lack of fundamental understanding of its\nbasic properties and expected performances, in particular when the device is\ndriven out of equilibrium. To fill the current gap in understanding, we\ninvestigate the electrostatics and electronic transport of 2D lateral pn\njunctions. To do so we implement a physics-based simulator that\nselfconsistently solves the 2D Poisson's equation coupled to the\ndrift-diffusion and continuity equations. Notably, the simulator takes into\naccount the strong influence of the out of plane electric field through the\nsurrounding dielectric, capturing the weak screening of charge carriers.\nSupported by simulations, we propose a Shockley-like equation for the ideal\ncurrent voltage characteristics, in full analogy to the bulk junction after\ndefining an effective depletion layer (EDL). We also discuss the impact of\nrecombination generation processes inside the EDL, which actually produce a\nsignificant deviation with respect to the ideal behavior, consistently with\nexperimental data. Moreover, we analyze the capacitances and conductance of the\n2D lateral pn junction. Based on its equivalent circuit we investigate its\ncut-off frequency targeting RF applications. To gain deeper insight into the\nrole played by material dimensionality, we benchmark the performances of\nsingle-layer MoS2 (2D) lateral pn junctions against those of the Si (3D)\njunction. Finally, a practical discussion on the short length 2D junction case\ntogether with the expected impact of interface states has been provided.

By operationalizing notions of\ncontrol theory for brain networks, it offers a fundamental explanation for how\nbrain dynamics may be regulated by structural connectivity. While powerful, the\napproach does not currently consider other non-structural explanations of brain\ndynamics. Here we extend the analysis of network controllability by formalizing\nthe evolution of neural signals as a function of effective inter-regional\ncoupling and pairwise signal covariance. We find that functional\ncontrollability characterizes a region's impact on the capacity for the whole\nsystem to shift between states, and significantly predicts individual\ndifference in performance on cognitively demanding tasks including those task\nworking memory, language, and emotional intelligence. When comparing\nmeasurements from functional and structural controllability, we observed\nconsistent relations between average and modal controllability, supporting\nprior work. In the same comparison, we also observed distinct relations between\ncontrollability and synchronizability, reflecting the additional information\nobtained from functional signals. Our work suggests that network control theory\ncan serve as a systematic analysis tool to understand the energetics of brain\nstate transitions, associated cognitive processes, and subsequent behaviors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Mar 2020 15:36:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-20"}

In many beyond Standard\nModel scenarios, however, the amount and free-streaming nature of this\ncomponent is modified. For example, this occurs in models with new neutrino\nself-interactions or an additional dark sector with interacting light\nparticles. We consider several extensions of the standard cosmology that\ninclude a non-free-streaming radiation component as motivated by such particle\nphysics models and use the final Planck data release to constrain them. This\nrelease contains significant improvements in the polarization likelihood which\nplays an important role in distinguishing free-streaming from interacting\nradiation species. Fixing the total amount of energy in radiation to match the\nexpectation from standard neutrino decoupling we find that the fraction of\nfree-streaming radiation must be $f_\\mathrm{fs} > 0.8$ at 95% CL (combining\ntemperature, polarization and baryon acoustic oscillation data). Allowing for\narbitrary contributions of free-streaming and interacting radiation, the\neffective number of new non-free-streaming degrees of freedom is constrained to\nbe $N_\\mathrm{fld} < 0.6$ at 95% CL.

This leads to a\nsecond-order differential equation in terms of the Hamiltonian shift alone,\nwhose ray-normal counterpart coincides with the normal shift of the\ncorresponding Lagrangian solution, while the ray-tangent component does not\naffect the Jacobian and the geometric spreading. Comparing the proposed\nLagrangian approach to the dynamic ray tracing with the \"classical\" Hamiltonian\napproach, we demonstrate that they are fully compatible for general anisotropy.\nWe then derive the two-way relationships between the Hamiltonian's and\nLagrangian's Hessians, which are the core computational elements of dynamic ray\ntheory. Finally, we demonstrate the relationships between these two types of\nthe Hessians numerically, for a general triclinic medium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Mar 2020 21:52:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-24"}

Here, we report the use of a network of CdSe\nbranched colloidal nanocrystals, made of a CdSe core and eight CdSe pods\n(so-called octapods), able to host on their pods Pt particles, and thus\ncatalyzing water splitting reactions. Thanks to the octapod shape, the\nresulting Pt-hosting network is mechanically trapped onto carbon nanotube\nbuckypaper, providing mechanically flexible and binder-free electrodes. We\nfound that such hierarchical configuration maximizes the mass activity and the\nutilization efficiency of Pt for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). At a\npotential of -0.15 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, the Pt/octapod\nnetwork-based electrodes display a Pt mass activity on the HER of 166 A mg-1\nand 42 A mg-1 in acidic and alkaline media, respectively.

In this work, we focus on the LTE-Unlicensed\n(LTE-U) specification developed by the LTE-U Forum, which uses the duty-cycle\napproach for fair coexistence. The specification suggests reducing the duty\ncycle at the LTE-U base-station (BS) when the number of co-channel Wi-Fi basic\nservice sets (BSSs) increases from one to two or more. However, without\ndecoding the Wi-Fi packets, detecting the number of Wi-Fi BSSs operating on the\nchannel in real-time is a challenging problem. In this work, we demonstrate a\nnovel ML-based approach which solves this problem by using energy values\nobserved during the LTE-U OFF duration. It is relatively straightforward to\nobserve only the energy values during the LTE-U BS OFF time compared to\ndecoding the entire Wi-Fi packet, which would require a full Wi-Fi receiver at\nthe LTE-U base-station. We implement and validate the proposed ML-based\napproach by real-time experiments and demonstrate that there exist distinct\npatterns between the energy distributions between one and many Wi-Fi AP\ntransmissions.
