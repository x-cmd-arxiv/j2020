To address this\nissue, existing methods use a fully factorized structure (or a mixture of such\nstructures) over all the outputs and latent functions for posterior\napproximation, which, however, can miss the strong posterior dependencies among\nthe latent variables and hurt the inference quality. In addition, the updates\nof the variational parameters are inefficient and can be prohibitively\nexpensive for a large number of outputs.

Also, most stars, during this phase, engulf part of their\nplanetary system, including their gas giant planets and possibly brown dwarfs.\nGas giant planet masses range between 0.1 to 2\\% of the host star mass. The\nengulfing of their gas giants planets can modify their luminosity at the TRGB,\ni.e. the point at which the He-core degeneracy is removed. We show that the\nincrease in mass of the star by the engulfing of the gas giant planets only\nmodifies the luminosity of a star at the TRGB by less than 0.1\\%, while\nmetallicity can modify the luminosity of a star at the TRGB by up to 0.5\\%.\nHowever, the increase in turbulence of the convective envelope of the star, has\na more dramatic effect, on the star's luminosity, which we estimate could be as\nlarge as 5\\%. The effect is always in the direction to increase the turbulence\nand thus the mixing length which turns into a systematic decrease of the\nluminosity of the star at the TRGB. We find that the star-to-star variation of\nthe mass-loss rate will dominate the variations in the luminosity of the TRGB\nwith a contribution at the 5\\% level.

In\nthe typical setting of signaling games, reactions conducted by the defender are\nsupposed to be public information and the measurability enables the attacker to\naccurately trace transitions of the defender's belief on existence of a\nmalicious attacker.

It\nappears that such models are incomplete in that they neglect kinetic effects\nassociated with long mean free paths of stellar wind particles, and the\ncomplexity of Weibel instability fronts. Wind ions are scattered in the Weibel\ninstability and mix with the interstellar gas. However, they do not lose their\nmomentum and most ultimately diffuse further into the ambient gas like cosmic\nrays, and share their energy and momentum. Lacking other coolants, the heated\ngas transfers energy to interstellar dust grains, which radiate it. This\nprocess, in addition to grain photo-heating, provides the energy for the\nemission. A weak R-type ionization front, formed well outside the infrared\nemission region, generally moderates the interstellar gas flow into the\nemission region. The theory suggests that the infrared emission process is\nlimited to cases of moderate stellar peculiar velocities, evidently in accord\nwith the observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Mar 2020 19:03:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-08"}

Multiple\nvariable selection procedures tailored for causal effect estimation have been\ndevised in recent years, but additional developments are still required to\nadequately address the needs of data analysts. In this paper, we propose a\nGeneralized Bayesian Causal Effect Estimation (GBCEE) algorithm to perform\nvariable selection and produce double robust estimates of causal effects for\nbinary or continuous exposures and outcomes. GBCEE employs a prior distribution\nthat targets the selection of true confounders and predictors of the outcome\nfor the unbiased estimation of causal effects with reduced standard errors.\nDouble robust estimators provide some robustness against model\nmisspecification, whereas the Bayesian machinery allows GBCEE to directly\nproduce inferences for its estimate. GBCEE was compared to multiple\nalternatives in various simulation scenarios and was observed to perform\nsimilarly or to outperform double robust alternatives. Its ability to directly\nproduce inferences is also an important advantage from a computational\nperspective. The method is finally illustrated for the estimation of the effect\nof meeting physical activity recommendations on the risk of hip or upper-leg\nfractures among elderly women in the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures. The 95%\nconfidence interval produced by GBCEE is 61% shorter than that of a double\nrobust estimator adjusting for all potential confounders in this illustration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Mar 2020 19:13:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-27"}

For a given\ncircular orbit, the chord length determines the transit duration. Changes in\nthe orbital inclination, the direction of the ascending node, or both, can\nalter this chord length and thus result in transit duration variations (TDVs).\nVariation of the full orbital inclination vector can even lead to de-transiting\nor newly transiting planets for a system. We use Laplace-Lagrange secular\ntheory to estimate the fastest nodal eigenfrequencies for over 100 short-period\nplanetary systems. The highest eigenfrequency is an indicator of which systems\nshould show the strongest TDVs. We further explore five cases (TRAPPIST-1,\nKepler-11, K2-138, Kepler-445, and Kepler-334) using direct N-body simulations\nto characterize possible TDVs and to explore whether de-transiting planets\ncould be possible for these systems. A range of initial conditions are\nexplored, with each realization being consistent with the observed transits. We\nfind that tens of percent of multiplanet systems have fast enough\neigenfrequencies to expect large TDVs on decade timescales. Among the directly\nintegrated cases, we find that de-transiting planets could occur on decade\ntimescales and TDVs of 10 minutes per decade should be common.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Mar 2020 19:15:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

In many cases, interviews are conducted in multiple\nprocesses such as telephone interviews and several face-to-face interviews. At\neach stage, candidates are evaluated in various aspects. Among them, grade\nevaluation, such as a rating on a 1-4 scale, might be used as a reasonable\nmethod to evaluate candidates. However, because each evaluation is based on a\nsubjective judgment of interviewers, the aggregated evaluations can be biased\nbecause the difference in toughness of interviewers is not examined.\nAdditionally, it is noteworthy that the toughness of interviewers might vary\ndepending on the interview round. As described herein, we propose an analytical\nframework of simultaneous estimation for both the true potential of candidates\nand toughness of interviewers' judgment considering job interview rounds, with\nalgorithms to extract unseen knowledge of the true potential of candidates and\ntoughness of interviewers as latent variables through analyzing grade data of\njob interviews.

When organisms lose resilience, this\nability of synchronizing can become weaker till they eventually become\ndesynchronized in a state of malfunctioning or sickness. It would be useful to\nmeasure this loss of resilience before the full desynchronization takes place.\nSeveral dynamical indicators of resilience (DIORs) have been proposed to\naccount for the loss of resilience of a dynamical system. The performance of\nthese indicators depends on the underlying mechanism of the critical\ntransition, usually a saddle-node bifurcation. Before such bifurcation the\nrecovery rate from perturbations of the system becomes slower, a mechanism\nknown as critical slowing down. Here we show that, for a wide class of\nbiological systems, desynchronization happens through another bifurcation,\nnamely the saddle-node of cycles, for which critical slowing down cannot be\ndirectly detected. Such a bifurcation represents a system transitioning from\nsynchronized (phase locked) to a desynchronized state, or vice versa. We show\nthat after an appropriate transformation we can also detect this bifurcation\nusing dynamical indicators of resilience.

Survival analysis is a promising method for analyzing the\nexpected duration of events and usually assumes the same survival function for\nall subjects and the event will occur in the long run. However, such\nassumptions are inappropriate when the users behave differently or some events\nnever occur for some users, i.e., the conversion period on web services of the\nlight users with no intention of behaving actively on the service. Especially,\nif the proportion of inactive users is high, this assumption can lead to\nundesirable results. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a mixture\nmodel that separately addresses active and inactive individuals with a latent\nvariable. First, we define this specific problem setting and show the\nlimitations of conventional survival analysis in addressing this problem. We\ndemonstrate how naturally our Bernoulli-Weibull model can accommodate the\nchallenge. The proposed model was extended further to a Bayesian hierarchical\nmodel to incorporate each subject's parameter, offering substantial\nimprovements over conventional, non-hierarchical models in terms of WAIC and\nWBIC. Second, an experiment and extensive analysis were conducted using\nreal-world data from the Japanese job search website, CareerTrek, offered by\nBizReach, Inc. In the analysis, some research questions are raised, such as the\ndifference in activation rate and conversion rate between user categories, and\nhow instantaneously the rate of event occurrence changes as time passes.\nQuantitative answers and interpretations are assigned to them. Furthermore, the\nmodel is inferred in a Bayesian manner, which enables us to represent the\nuncertainty with a credible interval of the parameters and predictive\nquantities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Mar 2020 20:07:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-27"}

Low-mass stars\nthat are currently observed as metal-poor stars are expected to have formed in\nchemically homogeneous clusters in the early phases of galaxy formation. They\nshould have already disintegrated and should exhibit large scatter in abundance\nratios of some sets of elements (e.g., Sr/Ba) in the Milky Way field stars.\nHowever, chemical abundance ratios are expected to cluster in very metal-poor\nstars in dwarf galaxies because the number of clusters formed in individual\ngalaxies in the very early phase is expected to be quite limited. We examine\nthe possible clustering of abundance ratios of Sr and Ba in the Sextans dwarf\ngalaxy to test for the clustering star formation scenario. We investigate a\ntotal of 11 elements (C, Mg, Ca, Sc, Ti, Cr, Mn, Ni, Zn, Sr, Ba) in five stars\nin the Sextans dwarf galaxy. Previous studies suggest that these have similar\nabundance ratios.

The distribution of\n$\\alpha$/Fe abundance ratios of the Sextans dwarf galaxy stars is slightly\nlower than the average of the values of stars in the Galactic halo. The Sr/Ba\nabundance ratios for the five metal-poor stars are in good agreement, and this\nclumping is distinctive compared to the [Sr/Ba] spread seen in the metal-poor\nhalo stars.

There are two possible states of nature (or hypotheses).\nObservations are collected by two observers. The observations are statistically\nrelated to the true state of nature. Given the observations, the objective of\nboth observers is to find out what is the true state of nature. We present four\ndifferent approaches to address the problem. In the first (centralized)\napproach, the observations collected by both observers are sent to a central\ncoordinator where hypothesis testing is performed. In the second approach, each\nobserver performs hypothesis testing based on locally collected observations.\nThen they exchange binary information to arrive at a consensus. In the third\napproach, each observer constructs an aggregated probability space based on the\nobservations collected by it and the decision it receives from the alternate\nobserver and performs hypothesis testing in the new probability space.

Previously, such pairs were constructed by ad hoc methods, which\nworked because a commuting operator of low order could be found by a direct\ncalculation. We describe a general approach to these problems that proves that\nevery point $W$ of Wilson's infinite dimensional adelic Grassmannian $\\mathrm\nGr^ad$ gives rise to an integral operator $T_W$, acting on $L^2(\\Gamma)$ for a\ncontour $\\Gamma\\subset\\mathbb C$, which reflects a differential operator\n$R(z,\\partial_z)$ in the sense that $R(-z,-\\partial_z)\\circ T_W=T_W\\circ\nR(w,\\partial_w)$ on a dense subset of $L^2(\\Gamma)$. By using analytic methods\nand methods from integrable systems, we show that the reflected differential\noperator can be constructed from the Fourier algebra of the associated\nbispectral function $\\psi_W(x,z)$. The size of this algebra with respect to a\nbifiltration is in turn determined using algebro-geometric methods. Intrinsic\nproperties of four involutions of the adelic Grassmannian naturally lead us to\nconsider the reflecting property in place of plain commutativity.

In these cases, we obtain simultaneously an\ninterpretation and generalization bound (for the original DNN), connecting two\nfronts which have historically been investigated separately. Unlike compression\ntechniques, our representation is. We motivate the utility of this perspective\nby studying DNNs in simple, controlled settings, where we obtain superior\ngeneralization bounds despite using only combinatorial information (e.g. no\nmargin information). We demonstrate how to \"open the black box\" on the MNIST\ndataset. We show that the learned, internal, logical computations correspond to\nsemantically meaningful (unlabeled) categories that allow DNN descriptions in\nplain English. We improve the generalization of an already trained network by\ninterpreting, diagnosing, and replacing components the logical circuit that is\nthe DNN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Mar 2020 20:39:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Jun 2020 15:29:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-29"}

Our theory provides a direct link to the build-up\nof the Floquet-Chern insulator state in light-driven graphene and its detection\nin time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). This allows us\nto study the stability of the Floquet features due to dephasing and\nthermalization effects. We also discuss the ultrafast Hall response in the\nlaser-heated state. Furthermore, the induced pseudospin texture and the\nassociated Berry curvature gives rise to momentum-dependent orbital\nmagnetization, which is reflected in circular dichroism in ARPES (CD-ARPES).\nCombining our nonequilibrium calculations with an accurate one-step theory of\nphotoemission allows us to establish a direct link between the build-up of the\ntopological state and the dichroic pump-probe photoemission signal.

These new insights can\nhave important implications where we address the basic issue of particle\ntrapping as an example.

The first part is concerned with\nsolving the dynamics of the standard nonlinear optomechanical Hamiltonian with\nan additional time-dependent mechanical displacement and single-mode squeezing\nterm. The solution is based on identifying a Lie algebra that generates the\ntime-evolution of the system, which reduces the problem to considering a finite\nset of coupled ordinary differential equations of real functions. The second\npart applies the solutions of the extended optomechanical Hamiltonian to the\nstudy of non-Gaussianity. We compute the non-Gaussian character of an\noptomechanical state as a function of the parameters in the Hamiltonian, and\ninvestigate the interplay between the non-Gaussianity, the strength of the\nnonlinear coupling and the strength of the single-mode mechanical squeezing\nterm. We find that the strength and form of the nonlinear coupling strongly\nimpacts the non-Gaussianity, and that its relationship with the squeezing term\nis highly complex. The third part concerns the use of nonlinear optomechanical\nsystems as quantum sensors. We derive a general expression of the quantum\nFisher information given the extended optomechanical Hamiltonian and\ndemonstrate its applicability through three concrete examples: estimating the\nstrength of a nonlinear light--matter coupling, the strength of a\ntime-modulated mechanical displacement, and the strength of a single-mode\nmechanical squeezing parameter, all of which are modulated at resonance.

The\nHFB formalism generalizes the standard Bogoliubov quasi-particle\ntransformation, by allowing for Cooper pairing to exist between all possible\nsingle-particle states, and accounts for the effects of the inhomogeneous\ntrapping potential as well as the mean-field Hartree potential.

In a harmonic trap,\nnumerical minimization of the HFB ground state energy yields a spatially\noscillating order parameter reminiscent of the FFLO state.

To\nenhance robustness of RRNN, alternative training approaches have been proposed.\nSpecifically, FORCE learning approach proposed a recursive least squares\nalternative to train RRNN and was shown to be applicable even for the\nchallenging task of target-learning, where the network is tasked with\ngenerating dynamic patterns with no guiding input. While FORCE training\nindicates that solving target-learning is possible, it appears to be effective\nonly in a specific regime of network dynamics (edge-of-chaos).

Two main challenges spring from\nthis new task: (i) how to generate fine-grained details and realistic textures\nwithout segmentation map input; and (ii) how to create a background and weave\nit seamlessly into standalone objects. To tackle this, we propose Background\nHallucination Generative Adversarial Network (BachGAN), which first selects a\nset of segmentation maps from a large candidate pool via a background retrieval\nmodule, then encodes these candidate layouts via a background fusion module to\nhallucinate a suitable background for the given objects.

Conventional WPCNs rely\nonly on dedicated downlink wireless power transfer (WPT), which is practically\ninefficient due to the significant energy loss in wireless signal propagation.\nMeanwhile, ambient energy harvesting is highly appealing as devices can\nscavenge energy from various existing energy sources (e.g., solar energy and\ncellular signals). Unfortunately, the randomness of the availability of these\nenergy sources cannot guarantee stable communication services. Motivated by the\nabove, we consider a generalized WPCN where the devices can not only harvest\nenergy from a dedicated multiple-antenna power station (PS), but can also\nexploit stored energy stemming from ambient energy harvesting. Since the\ndedicated WPT consumes system resources, if the stored energy is sufficient,\nWPT may not be needed to maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR). To analytically\ncharacterize this phenomenon, we derive the condition for WPT activation and\nreveal how it is affected by the different system parameters. Subsequently, we\nfurther derive the optimal resource allocation policy for the cases that WPT is\nactivated and deactivated, respectively. In particular, it is found that when\nWPT is activated, the optimal energy beamforming at the PS does not depend on\nthe devices' stored energy, which is shown to lead to a new unfairness issue.\nSimulation results verify our theoretical findings and demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed optimal resource allocation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Mar 2020 03:05:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-27"}

A substantial increase in\nspectrum efficiency for mmWave transmission can be achieved by using advanced\nhybrid precoding, for which accurate channel state information is the key.\nRather than estimating the entire channel matrix, directly estimating subspace\ninformation, which contains fewer parameters, does have enough information to\ndesign transceivers. However, the large channel use overhead and associated\ncomputational complexity in the existing channel subspace estimation techniques\nare major obstacles to deploy the subspace approach for channel estimation. In\nthis paper, we propose a sequential two-stage subspace estimation method that\ncan resolve the overhead issues and provide accurate subspace information.\nUtilizing a sequential method enables us to avoid manipulating the entire\nhigh-dimensional training signal, which greatly reduces the complexity.\nSpecifically, in the first stage, the proposed method samples the columns of\nchannel matrix to estimate its column subspace. Then, based on the obtained\ncolumn subspace, it optimizes the training signals to estimate the row\nsubspace. For a channel with $N_r$ receive antennas and $N_t$ transmit\nantennas, our analysis shows that the proposed technique only requires $O(N_t)$\nchannel uses, while providing a guarantee of subspace estimation accuracy. By\ntheoretical analysis, it is shown that the similarity between the estimated\nsubspace and the true subspace is linearly related to the signal-to-noise ratio\n(SNR), i.e., $O(\\text{SNR})$, at high SNR, while quadratically related to the\nSNR, i.e., $O(\\text{SNR}^2)$, at low SNR.

Despite its potential, EHR is currently underutilized for discovery\nresearch due to it's major limitation in the lack of precise phenotype\ninformation. To overcome such difficulties, recent efforts have been devoted to\ndeveloping supervised algorithms to accurately predict phenotypes based on\nrelatively small training datasets with gold standard labels extracted via\nchart review. However, supervised methods typically require a sizable training\nset to yield generalizable algorithms especially when the number of candidate\nfeatures, $p$, is large. In this paper, we propose a semi-supervised (SS) EHR\nphenotyping method that borrows information from both a small labeled data\nwhere both the label $Y$ and the feature set $X$ are observed and a much larger\nunlabeled data with observations on $X$ only as well as a surrogate variable\n$S$ that is predictive of $Y$ and available for all patients, under a high\ndimensional setting. Under a working prior assumption that $S$ is related to\n$X$ only through $Y$ and allowing it to hold approximately, we propose a prior\nadaptive semi-supervised (PASS) estimator that adaptively incorporates the\nprior knowledge by shrinking the estimator towards a direction derived under\nthe prior.

We argue that similar property holds for the magnetically\ninduced electric polarization P, which should depend only on the relative\norientation of spins in the bonds but not on the direction of each individual\nspin. Thus, for insulating multiferroic compounds, P can be decomposed in terms\nof pairwise isotropic, antisymmetric, and anisotropic contributions, which can\nbe rigorously derived in the framework of the superexchange (SE) theory, in an\nanalogy with the spin Hamiltonian.

Our noisy comparator model is motivated by the\nproblem of hypothesis selection, where given a set of $N$ known candidate\nprobability distributions and samples from an unknown target distribution, one\nseeks to output some candidate distribution $O(\\varepsilon)$-close to the\nunknown target. Much work on the classical front has been devoted to speeding\nup the run time of classical hypothesis selection from $O(N^2)$ to $O(N)$, in\npart by using statistical primitives such as the Scheff\\'{e} test. Assuming a\nquantum oracle generalization of the classical data access and applying our\nnoisy quantum minimum-finding algorithm, we take this run time into the\nsublinear regime. The final expected run time is $\\tilde O(\n\\sqrt{N(1+\\Delta)})$, with the same $O(\\log N)$ sample complexity from the\nunknown distribution as the classical algorithm. We expect robust quantum\nminimum-finding to be a useful building block for algorithms in situations\nwhere the comparator (which may be another quantum or classical algorithm) is\nresolution-limited or subject to some uncertainty.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Mar 2020 07:42:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-31"}

We also consider the Markov property\nof a minimizer of the stochastic optimal transportation problem with a\nnonconvex cost in a one-dimensional case. In the proof, the superposition\nprinciple and the minimizer of an optimal transportation problem with a concave\ncost function play crucial roles. Lastly, we prove the semiconcavity and the\nLipschitz continuity of Schrodinger's problem that is a typical example of the\nstochastic optimal transportation problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Mar 2020 09:31:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Jun 2020 21:50:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 26 Jun 2020 00:53:44 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 25 Aug 2020 07:09:10 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sat, 5 Sep 2020 09:35:18 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2020 07:19:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-18"}

In order to get the directional signature, the DDM detectors\nshould be sensitive to low nuclear energy recoils in the keV range and have an\nangular resolution better than $20^{\\circ}$. We have performed experiments with\nlow energy ($<30\\,\\mathrm{keV}$) ion beam facilities to measure the angular\ndistribution of nuclear recoil tracks in a MIMAC detector prototype. In this\npaper, we study angular spreads with respect to the electron drift direction\n($0^{\\circ}$ incident angle) of Fluorine nuclear tracks in this low energy\nrange, and show nuclear recoil angle reconstruction produced by a monoenergetic\nneutron field experiment. We find that a high-gain systematic effect leads to a\nhigh angular resolution along the electron drift direction. The measured\nangular distribution is impacted by diffusion, and space charge or ion feedback\neffects, which can be corrected for by an asymmetry factor observed in the\nflash-ADC profile. The estimated angular resolution of the $0^{\\circ}$ incident\nion is better than $15^{\\circ}$ at $10$ keV kinetic energy and agrees with the\nsimulations within $20$%.

According to this criterion, in the MBL phase many resonances are formed\nat large distance from an infinite temperature initial state, but they are not\nenough for the quantum dynamics to decorrelate from it in a finite time. This\nimplies that, differently from Anderson localized states, in the insulating\nphase many-body eigenstates are multifractal in the Hilbert space, as they\noccupy a large but subexponential part of the total volume, in agreement with\nrecent numerical results, perturbative calculations, and intuitive arguments.\nPossible limitations and implications of our interpretation are discussed in\nthe conclusions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Mar 2020 11:46:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 31 Jul 2020 20:56:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-05"}

The first proposal is based on neural interface\nsystems (NIS) with enhanced feedback, where the external machines are\ninterfaced with the brain and the spinal cord such that the brain signals are\ndirectly routed to the limbs for movement. The second proposal relates to the\ndesign of self-organizing artificial neurons (ANs) that can be used to replace\nthe injured or dead biological neurons.

The conventional\ninclined solar still (ISS) suffers from low efficiency and low productivity. To\nimprove the performance of solar still, a flat solar still (FSS) is proposed,\nwhich has a working principle similar to the solar cell. The condensate water\nin FSS is collected by the capillary grid attached under the ultra-hydrophilic\nglass cover, instead of by gravity. Therefore, FSS avoids the inclined\nstructure and is much more compact than ISS. The daily productivity of FSS\nreaches up to 4.3 kg/m2. Theoretical analysis shows that the enhanced mass\ntransfer in FSS by the compact structure is an important factor for high\nperformance. More interestingly, FSS can also be easily extended to more stage\nfor latent heat recovery. The results show that the daily productivity of a\ndouble-stage FSS reaches up to 7 kg/m2, which is much higher than the\nconventional solar still.

However, for most metals, this behavior\nis only restricted to very low temperatures, usually below 20 K. Here, we\nexperimentally demonstrate that for the single-crystal van der Waals layered\nmaterial MoOCl2, the Baber law holds in a wide temperature range up to ~120 K,\nindicating that the electron-electron scattering plays a dominant role in this\nmaterial. Combining with the specific heat measurement, we find that the\nmodified Kadowaki-Woods ratio of the material agrees well with many other\nstrongly correlated metals. Furthermore, in the magneto-transport measurement,\na colossal magneto-resistance is observed, which reaches ~350% at 9 T and\ndisplays no sign of saturation. With the help of first-principles calculations,\nwe attribute this behavior to the presence of open orbits on the Fermi surface.\nWe also suggest that the dominance of electron-electron scattering is related\nto an incipient charge density wave state of the material. Our results\nestablish MoOCl2 as a strongly correlated metal and shed light on the\nunderlying physical mechanism, which may open a new path for exploring the\neffects of electron-electron interaction in van der Waals layered structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Mar 2020 13:55:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-27"}

We offer a simple\nexplanation for this discrepancy based on a selection effect due to beamed\nemission, in which highly-beamed FRBs are less easily observed to repeat, but\nare abundant enough to detect often as once-off events. The explanation\npredicts that there is a continuous distribution of burst duration---not a\nstatic bimodal one---with a correlation between repetition rate and width.\nPulse width and opening angle may be related by relativistic effects in shocks,\nwhere short-duration bursts have small solid angles due to a large common\nLorentz factor.

Backward compatibility is critical to quickly deploy new embedding\nmodels that leverage ever-growing large-scale training datasets and\nimprovements in deep learning architectures and training methods.

Short texts do\nnot provide enough context information, causing the failure of the traditional\nstatistical models. Furthermore, many applications often face with massive and\ndynamic short texts, causing various computational challenges to the current\nbatch learning algorithms. This paper presents a novel framework, namely Bag of\nBiterms Modeling (BBM), for modeling massive, dynamic, and short text\ncollections. BBM comprises of two main ingredients: (1) the concept of Bag of\nBiterms (BoB) for representing documents, and (2) a simple way to help\nstatistical models to include BoB. Our framework can be easily deployed for a\nlarge class of probabilistic models, and we demonstrate its usefulness with two\nwell-known models: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Hierarchical Dirichlet\nProcess (HDP). By exploiting both terms (words) and biterms (pairs of words),\nthe major advantages of BBM are: (1) it enhances the length of the documents\nand makes the context more coherent by emphasizing the word connotation and\nco-occurrence via Bag of Biterms, (2) it inherits inference and learning\nalgorithms from the primitive to make it straightforward to design online and\nstreaming algorithms for short texts. Extensive experiments suggest that BBM\noutperforms several state-of-the-art models. We also point out that the BoB\nrepresentation performs better than the traditional representations (e.g, Bag\nof Words, tf-idf) even for normal texts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Mar 2020 14:47:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-27"}

Materials and Method: Chest CT images of 176 patients (age\n45.3$\\pm$16.5 years, 96 male and 80 female) with confirmed COVID-19 are used,\nfrom which 63 quantitative features, e.g., the infection volume/ratio of the\nwhole lung and the volume of ground-glass opacity (GGO) regions, are\ncalculated.

This suggests a fine-tuning in\norder to eliminate this dependence from experimental observation. We also study\nthe signalling properties of these extended models. We show that although they\ngenerally violate the formal no-signalling constraints, this violation cannot\nbe equated to an actual signal. We therefore suggest that the so-called\nno-signalling constraints be more appropriately named the marginal-independence\nconstraints. We discuss the mechanism by which marginal-independence is\nviolated in superdeterministic models. Lastly, we consider a hypothetical\nscenario where two experimenters use the apparent-signalling of a\nsuperdeterministic model to communicate with each other. This scenario suggests\nanother conspiratorial feature peculiar to superdeterminism. These suggestions\nare quantitatively developed in the second paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Mar 2020 15:49:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Jul 2020 00:49:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 15 Oct 2020 22:36:07 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2020 16:53:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-08"}

This idea paper takes a constructive\nlook at this question, by exploring how alternate monetary principles might\nresult in a form of money more compatible with democratic principles -- dare we\ncall it \"democratic money\"? In this alternative macroeconomic philosophy, both\nthe supply of and the demand for money must be rooted in people, so as to give\nall people both equal opportunities for economic participation. Money must be\ndesigned around equality, not only across all people alive at a given moment,\nbut also across past and future generations of people, guaranteeing that our\ndescendants cannot be enslaved by their ancestors' economic luck or misfortune.\nDemocratic money must reliably give all people a means to enable everyday\ncommerce, investment, and value creation in good times and bad, and must impose\nhard limits on financial inequality.

The goal of this paper is to disentangle and further\ndevelop some of the many concepts and goals that liquid democracy ideas often\nembody, to explore their justification with respect to existing democratic\ntraditions such as transferable voting and political parties, and to explore\npotential risks in liquid democracy systems and ways to address them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Mar 2020 09:43:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-30"}

However,\nnaloxone has short brain retention ability, which limits its therapeutic\nefficacy. Developing better opioid antagonists is critical in combating the\nopioid epidemic.Instead of exhaustively searching in a huge chemical space for\nbetter opioid antagonists, we adopt reinforcement learning which allows\nefficient gradient-based search towards molecules with desired physicochemical\nand/or biological properties. Specifically, we implement a deep reinforcement\nlearning framework to discover potential lead compounds as better opioid\nantagonists with enhanced brain retention ability. A customized multi-objective\nreward function is designed to bias the generation towards molecules with both\nsufficient opioid antagonistic effect and enhanced brain retention ability.\nThorough evaluation demonstrates that with this framework, we are able to\nidentify valid, novel and feasible molecules with multiple desired properties,\nwhich has high potential in drug discovery.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Mar 2020 15:28:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-13"}

Two lasers,\nwith their frequencies differing by that of a Langmuir wave, counter-propagate\ninside a background plasma, exciting a rather strong Langmuir wave. The THz\nlight amplification occurs through the non-resonant Raman scattering between\nthe THz light and one of the lasers in the presence of the mentioned Langmuir\nwave. It is normally the case that the non-resonant scattering does not\nexchange the energy between E \\&M fields but the author demonstrates that it is\npossible under the pre-exciting Langmuir wave. In the presence of a\npre-existing Langmuir wave, the ponderomotive density perturbation between the\nTHz light and the visible-light laser is induced with the phase suitable for\ntransferring the energy from the visible light laser to the THz light.

Apart from\ninitiating nicotine addiction in nonsmokers, a persistent concern about these\nproducts is that their emissions often include high levels of carbonyl species,\ntoxicants thought to cause most non-cancer pulmonary disease in smokers.\nCarbonyls are known thermal degradation products of the primary ECIG liquid\nconstituents: propylene glycol (PG) and vegetable glycerin (VG). To date, there\nis no method available to predict the operating conditions for which an ECIG of\na given design will emit large quantities of carbonyls. This study examined\nwhether the phenomenon of film boiling can account for observations of high\ncarbonyl emissions under certain operating conditions, and if so, whether film\nboiling theory can be invoked to predict conditions where such emissions are\nlikely. We measured the critical heat flux for several common heating materials\nand liquids, and carbonyl emissions for several ECIG types while varying power.\nWe found that emissions rise drastically whenever power exceeds the value\ncorresponding to the critical heat flux. While limiting the heat flux to below\nthis threshold can greatly reduce carbonyl exposure, ECIG manufacturer\noperating instructions often exceed it. Product regulations that limit heat\nflux may reduce the public health burden of electronic cigarette use.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Mar 2020 12:36:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-01"}
