A major characteristic of IAMs is that their\ngeophysical sector determines the mean surface temperature increase over the\npreindustrial level, which in turn determines the damage function. Most of the\nexisting IAMs are perfect-foresight forward-looking models, assuming that we\nknow all of the future information. However, there are significant\nuncertainties in the climate and economic system, including parameter\nuncertainty, model uncertainty, climate tipping risks, economic risks, and\nambiguity. For example, climate damages are uncertain: some researchers assume\nthat climate damages are proportional to instantaneous output, while others\nassume that climate damages have a more persistent impact on economic growth.\nClimate tipping risks represent (nearly) irreversible climate events that may\nlead to significant changes in the climate system, such as the Greenland ice\nsheet collapse, while the conditions, probability of tipping, duration, and\nassociated damage are also uncertain. Technological progress in carbon capture\nand storage, adaptation, renewable energy, and energy efficiency are uncertain\ntoo. In the face of these uncertainties, policymakers have to provide a\ndecision that considers important factors such as risk aversion, inequality\naversion, and sustainability of the economy and ecosystem. Solving this problem\nmay require richer and more realistic models than standard IAMs, and advanced\ncomputational methods. The recent literature has shown that these uncertainties\ncan be incorporated into IAMs and may change optimal climate policies\nsignificantly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 2020 16:00:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Oct 2020 22:01:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-20"}

Besides the communication service, channel state\ninformation (CSI) of the WiFi signals is widely employed for numerous Internet\nof Things (IoT) applications. Recently, most of these applications are based on\nanalysis of the microwave reflections caused by physical movement of the\nobjective. In this paper, a novel contactless wireless sensing technique named\nWiEps is developed to measure the dielectric properties of the material,\nexploiting the transmission characteristics of the WiFi signals. In WiEps, the\nmaterial under test is placed between the transmitter antenna and receiver\nantenna. A theoretical model is proposed to quantitatively describe the\nrelationship between CSI data and dielectric properties of the material. During\nthe experiment, the phase and amplitude of the transmitted WiFi signals are\nextracted from the measured CSI data. The parameters of the theoretical model\nare calculated using measured data from the known materials. Then, WiEps is\nutilized to estimate the dielectric properties of unknown materials. The\nproposed technique is first applied to the ethanol/water mixtures. Then,\nadditional liquids are measured for further verification. The estimated\npermittivities and conductivities show good agreement with the actual values,\nwith the average error of 4.0% and 8.9%, respectively, indicating the efficacy\nof WiEps. By measuring the dielectric property, this technique is promising to\nbe applied to new IoT applications using ubiquitous WiFi signals, such as food\nengineering, material manufacturing process monitoring, and security check.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 2020 16:24:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Jun 2020 16:25:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-08"}

However, these methods usually\nrequire large amounts of training data, which is often a big problem for\nreal-world applications. One natural question to ask is whether learning good\nrepresentations for states and using larger networks helps in learning better\npolicies. In this paper, we try to study if increasing input dimensionality\nhelps improve performance and sample efficiency of model-free deep RL\nalgorithms. To do so, we propose an online feature extractor network (OFENet)\nthat uses neural nets to produce good representations to be used as inputs to\ndeep RL algorithms. Even though the high dimensionality of input is usually\nsupposed to make learning of RL agents more difficult, we show that the RL\nagents in fact learn more efficiently with the high-dimensional representation\nthan with the lower-dimensional state observations. We believe that stronger\nfeature propagation together with larger networks (and thus larger search\nspace) allows RL agents to learn more complex functions of states and thus\nimproves the sample efficiency. Through numerical experiments, we show that the\nproposed method outperforms several other state-of-the-art algorithms in terms\nof both sample efficiency and performance.

On the other hand, at\n0.1 AU, the envelope quickly becomes fully-radiative, nearly isothermal, and\nthus cannot cool down, stalling gas accretion.

MATLOC\ncalculates transport and dispersion of mass over regions in the range of\n100-1000s of square kilometers and is a significant improvement over existing\ncommunity codes. This paper describes results from both the transport and\ndispersion application as well as some difficult Quantum Chemistry open shell\ncoupled cluster benchmark calculations using Aces4.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 2020 18:13:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-04"}

The incompressible part enjoys\nan inviscid damping property, analogous to the Couette case.

The result then follows by\nusing weighted energy estimates. In the general case, unfortunately, this\nconservation law no longer holds. Therefore we define a suitable weighted\nenergy functional for the whole system, which can be used to estimate the\nirrotational component of the velocity but does not provide sharp bounds on the\nsolenoidal component.

The eruption takes place for the same\nvalue of the ratio of the current-carrying helicity to the total helicity in\nall simulations.

The origin of such peculiar configurations is\npuzzling, and all scenarios suggested for the origins of contact-binaries fail\nto reproduce such properties and their likely high frequency.

Indeed, it represents a special case of a multi-objective\nproblem, in which all objectives are prioritized equally. To the best of our\nknowledge, multi-objective optimization applied to multi-agent systems remains\nlargely unexplored. Therefore, we propose a distributed algorithm that allows\nthe exploration of Pareto optimal solutions for the non-homogeneously weighted\nsum of objective functions. In the problems we consider, each agent has one\nobjective function to minimize based on a gradient method. Agents update their\ndecision variables by exchanging information with other agents in the network.\nInformation exchanges are weighted by each agent's individual weights that\nencode the extent to which they prioritize other agents' objectives.

However, causal\nestimation from observational data often relies on the (untestable) assumption\nof `no unobserved confounding'. Violations of this assumption can induce bias\nin effect estimates. In principle, such bias could invalidate or reverse the\nconclusions of a study. However, in some cases, we might hope that the\ninfluence of unobserved confounders is weak relative to a `large' estimated\neffect, so the qualitative conclusions are robust to bias from unobserved\nconfounding. The purpose of this paper is to develop \\emph{Austen plots}, a\nsensitivity analysis tool to aid such judgments by making it easier to reason\nabout potential bias induced by unobserved confounding. We formalize\nconfounding strength in terms of how strongly the confounder influences\ntreatment assignment and outcome. For a target level of bias, an Austen plot\nshows the minimum values of treatment and outcome influence required to induce\nthat level of bias. Domain experts can then make subjective judgments about\nwhether such strong confounders are plausible. To aid this judgment, the Austen\nplot additionally displays the estimated influence strength of (groups of) the\nobserved covariates. Austen plots generalize the classic sensitivity analysis\napproach of Imbens [Imb03]. Critically, Austen plots allow any approach for\nmodeling the observed data and producing the initial estimate. We illustrate\nthe tool by assessing biases for several real causal inference problems, using\na variety of machine learning approaches for the initial data analysis.

In this paper, we propose a new method\nand system for Molecular Communication in the Body, denoted MoSiMe and MoCoBo,\nrespectively. The method takes advantage of how the absorption, distribution,\nmetabolization, and elimination (ADME) bodily processes affects drugs, referred\nto as Pharmacokinetics (PK) in pharmacology, to enable MC between any points of\nthe human body regardless of their distance even if they are in different parts\nof the body and separated by tissues and fluids.

However, this requirement is very hard to satisfy in practice.\nData-driven approaches such as Gaussian processes (GPs) have proved quite\neffective by employing regression based methods to capture the unmodeled\ndynamical effects. However, GPs scale cubically with data, and is often a\nchallenge to perform real-time regression. In this paper, we propose a\nsemi-parametric framework exploiting sparsity for learning-based control. We\ncombine the parametric model of the system with multiple sparse GP models to\ncapture any unmodeled dynamics. Multi-Sparse Gaussian Process (MSGP) divides\nthe original dataset into multiple sparse models with unique hyperparameters\nfor each model. Thereby, preserving the richness and uniqueness of each sparse\nmodel. For a query point, a weighted sparse posterior prediction is performed\nbased on $N$ neighboring sparse models. Hence, the prediction complexity is\nsignificantly reduced from $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(Npu^2)$, where\n$p$ and $u$ are data points and pseudo-inputs respectively for each sparse\nmodel. We validate MSGP's learning performance for a quadrotor using a\ngeometric controller in simulation. Comparison with GP, sparse GP, and local GP\nshows that MSGP has higher prediction accuracy than sparse and local GP, while\nsignificantly lower time complexity than all three. We also validate MSGP on a\nhardware quadrotor for unmodeled mass, inertia, and disturbances.

Starting from\nhighly non-Gaussian correlations, consistent with the sine-Gordon model, we\nobserve a Gaussian state to emerge over time as revealed by the decay of the\nfourth and sixth order connected correlations in the quantum field. A\ndescription of this dynamics requires a novel mechanism for the emergence of\nGaussian correlations, which is relevant for a wide class of quantum many-body\nsystems.

Here, we report the simultaneous\nspatial and temporal photoconductivity imaging in two types of WS2 monolayers\nby laser-illuminated microwave impedance microscopy. The diffusion length and\ncarrier lifetime were directly extracted from the spatial profile and temporal\nrelaxation of microwave signals respectively. Time-resolved experiments\nindicate that the critical process for photo-excited carriers is the escape of\nholes from trap states, which prolongs the apparent lifetime of mobile\nelectrons in the conduction band. As a result, counterintuitively, the\nphotoconductivity is stronger in CVD samples than exfoliated monolayers with a\nlower defect density. Our work reveals the intrinsic time and length scales of\nelectrical response to photo-excitation in van der Waals materials, which is\nessential for their applications in novel optoelectronic devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 2020 22:33:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}

Here we present a first\ntest of a new model developed to determine if the times of increases in the\nresistive heating rate in active region (AR) photospheres are correlated with\nthe subsequent occurrence of M and X flares in the corona. A data driven, 3 D,\nnon-force-free magnetohydrodynamic model restricted to the near-photospheric\nregion is used to compute time series of the complete current density and the\nresistive heating rate per unit volume $(Q(t))$ in each pixel in neutral line\nregions (NLRs) of 14 ARs. The model is driven by time series of the magnetic\nfield ${\\bf B}$ measured by the Helioseismic & Magnetic Imager on the Solar\nDynamics Observatory (SDO) satellite. Spurious Doppler periods due to SDO\norbital motion are filtered out of the time series for ${\\bf B}$ in every AR\npixel. For each AR, the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the values of\nthe NLR area integral $Q_i(t)$ of $Q(t)$ is found to be a scale invariant power\nlaw distribution essentially identical to the observed CDF for the total energy\nreleased in coronal flares. This suggests that coronal flares and the\nphotospheric $Q_i$ are correlated, and powered by the same process. The model\npredicts spikes in $Q_i$ with values orders of magnitude above background\nvalues. These spikes are driven by spikes in the non-force free component of\nthe current density. The times of these spikes are plausibly correlated with\ntimes of subsequent M or X flares a few hours to a few days later. The spikes\noccur on granulation scales, and may be signatures of heating in horizontal\ncurrent sheets.

This\narchitecture can be readily translated towards setup with multiple cavities in\none- or two-dimensional phononic crystals, and the underlying non-resonant\nlocalization mechanism will pave the way to further enhance optoacoustic\ncoupling in phoxonic crystal cavities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 2020 23:34:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 May 2020 14:06:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-05"}

However, formation and survival of molecules in\ninner protostellar disk winds, in the presence of a harsh FUV radiation field\nand the absence of dust, remain unexplored. We aim at determining if simple\nmolecules can be synthesized and spared in fast and collimated dust-free disk\nwinds or if a fraction of dust is necessary to explain the observed molecular\nabundances. This work is based on the Paris-Durham shock code designed to model\nirradiated environments. Fundamental properties of the dust-free chemistry are\ninvestigated from single point models. A laminar 1D disk wind model is then\nbuilt using a parametric flow geometry. This model includes time-dependent\nchemistry and the attenuation of the radiation field by gas-phase\nphotoprocesses. We show that a small fraction of H2 (< 1e-2), primarily formed\nthrough the H- route, can efficiently initiate molecule synthesis such as CO\nand SiO above TK ~ 800 K. The attenuation of the radiation field by atomic\nspecies (eg. C, Si, S) proceeds through continuum self-shielding. This process\nensures efficient formation of CO, OH, SiO, H2O through neutral-neutral\nreactions, and the survival of these molecules. Class 0 dust-free winds with\nhigh mass-loss rates ($\\dot{M}_w >$ 2e-6 Msun/yr) are predicted to be rich in\nmolecules if warm (TK > 800 K). The molecular content of disk winds is very\nsensitive to the presence of dust and a mass-fraction of surviving dust as\nsmall as 1e-5 significantly increases the H2O and SiO abundances. Chemistry of\nhigh-velocity jets is a powerful tool to probe their content in dust and\nuncover their launching point. Models of internal shocks are required to fully\nexploit the current (sub-)millimeter observations and prepare future JWST\nobservations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Mar 2020 01:07:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

When a prediction model is developed in a given source\ncohort, there is often a great interest to apply the model to other cohorts.\nHowever, due to potential discrepancy in baseline disease incidences between\ndifferent cohorts and shifts in patient composition, the risk predicted by the\noriginal model often under- or over-estimates the risk in the new cohort. The\nremedy of such a poorly calibrated prediction is needed for proper medical\ndecision-making. In this article, we assume the relative risks of predictors\nare the same between the two cohorts, and propose a novel weighted estimating\nequation approach to re-calibrating the projected risk for the targeted\npopulation through updating the baseline risk. The recalibration leverages the\nknowledge about the overall survival probabilities for the disease of interest\nand competing events, and the summary information of risk factors from the\ntargeted population. The proposed re-calibrated risk estimators gain efficiency\nif the risk factor distributions are the same for both the source and target\ncohorts, and are robust with little bias if they differ. We establish the\nconsistency and asymptotic normality of the proposed estimators. Extensive\nsimulation studies demonstrate that the proposed estimators perform very well\nin terms of robustness and efficiency in finite samples.

We first define hypergraph motifs\n(h-motifs), which describe the connectivity patterns of three connected\nhyperedges.

With the rise of smart wearable devices equipped\nwith inertial measurement units (IMUs), researchers begin to utilize IMU data\nfor HAR. By employing machine learning algorithms, early IMU-based research for\nHAR can achieve accurate classification results on traditional classical HAR\ndatasets, containing only simple and repetitive daily activities. However,\nthese datasets rarely display a rich diversity of information in real-scene. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel method based on deep learning for complex HAR in\nthe real-scene.

Moreover, a deep convolutional neural\nnetwork with an unsupervised penalty is proposed to automatically extract the\nfeatures of AMASS and improve the robustness. In the on-line testing stage, by\nleveraging advantages of the transfer learning, we obtain the final result by\nfine-tuning the partial neural network (optimizing the parameters in the\nfully-connected layers) using the real IMU data.

A popular and effective approach\nfor implicit recommendation is to treat unobserved data as negative but\ndownweight their confidence. Naturally, how to assign confidence weights and\nhow to handle the large number of the unobserved data are two key problems for\nimplicit recommendation models. However, existing methods either pursuit fast\nlearning by manually assigning simple confidence weights, which lacks\nflexibility and may create empirical bias in evaluating user's preference; or\nadaptively infer personalized confidence weights but suffer from low\nefficiency. To achieve both adaptive weights assignment and efficient model\nlearning, we propose a fast adaptively weighted matrix factorization (FAWMF)\nbased on variational auto-encoder. The personalized data confidence weights are\nadaptively assigned with a parameterized neural network (function) and the\nnetwork can be inferred from the data. Further, to support fast and stable\nlearning of FAWMF, a new specific batch-based learning algorithm fBGD has been\ndeveloped, which trains on all feedback data but its complexity is linear to\nthe number of observed data.

In this way, no exclusive spectrum resources\nneed to be pre-allocated to the sporadic warning messages.

In this work, we investigate the problem of hashing with graph\nneural networks (GNNs) for high quality retrieval, and propose a simple yet\neffective discrete representation learning framework to jointly learn\ncontinuous and discrete codes. Specifically, a deep hashing with GNNs (HashGNN)\nis presented, which consists of two components, a GNN encoder for learning node\nrepresentations, and a hash layer for encoding representations to hash codes.\nThe whole architecture is trained end-to-end by jointly optimizing two losses,\ni.e., reconstruction loss from reconstructing observed links, and ranking loss\nfrom preserving the relative ordering of hash codes. A novel discrete\noptimization strategy based on straight through estimator (STE) with guidance\nis proposed. The principal idea is to avoid gradient magnification in\nback-propagation of STE with continuous embedding guidance, in which we begin\nfrom learning an easier network that mimic the continuous embedding and let it\nevolve during the training until it finally goes back to STE.

Due to the lack of pixel correspondence between frames in the\noccluded area, incorrect photometric loss calculation can mislead the optical\nflow training process.

The frames in the first layer are compressed by an image compression\nmethod with the highest quality. Using these frames as references, we propose\nthe Bi-Directional Deep Compression (BDDC) network to compress the second layer\nwith relatively high quality. Then, the third layer frames are compressed with\nthe lowest quality, by the proposed Single Motion Deep Compression (SMDC)\nnetwork, which adopts a single motion map to estimate the motions of multiple\nframes, thus saving bits for motion information. In our deep decoder, we\ndevelop the Weighted Recurrent Quality Enhancement (WRQE) network, which takes\nboth compressed frames and the bit stream as inputs. In the recurrent cell of\nWRQE, the memory and update signal are weighted by quality features to\nreasonably leverage multi-frame information for enhancement. In our HLVC\napproach, the hierarchical quality benefits the coding efficiency, since the\nhigh quality information facilitates the compression and enhancement of low\nquality frames at encoder and decoder sides, respectively.

However, the introduction of a machine learning (ML)\nmodel introduces a new source of uncertainty, the ML model itself.\nQuantification of this uncertainty is essential since the predictive capability\nof a data-driven model diminishes when predicting physics not seen during\ntraining. In this work, we explore the suitability of Mondrian forests (MF's)\nfor data-driven turbulence modelling. MF's are claimed to possess many of the\nadvantages of the commonly used random forest (RF) machine learning algorithm,\nwhilst offering principled uncertainty estimates. An example test case is\nconstructed, with a turbulence anisotropy constant derived from high fidelity\nturbulence resolving simulations. Shapley values, borrowed from game theory,\nare used to interpret the MF predictions. Predictive uncertainty is found to be\nlarge in regions where the training data is not representative. Additionally,\nthe MF predictive uncertainty is found to exhibit stronger correlation with\npredictive errors compared to an a priori statistical distance measure, which\nindicates it is a better measure of prediction confidence. The MF predictive\nuncertainty is also found to be better calibrated and less computationally\ncostly than the uncertainty estimated from applying jackknifing to random\nforest predictions. Finally, Mondrian forests are used to predict the Reynolds\ndiscrepancies in a convergent-divergent channel, which are subsequently\npropagated through a modified CFD solver. The resulting flowfield predictions\nare in close agreement with the high fidelity data. A procedure for sampling\nthe Mondrian forests' uncertainties is introduced. Propagating these samples\nenables quantification of the uncertainty in output quantities of interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Mar 2020 09:36:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 18:04:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-12"}

The\nlarge majority of these satellites will be too faint to be seen with the naked\neye: at astronomical twilight, 110 brighter than mag 5. Most of them (~95%)\nwill be close to the horizon. The number of naked-eye satellites plummets as\nthe Sun reaches 30-40 deg below the horizon, depending on the latitude and\nseason.\n  The light trails caused by satellites would ruin a small fraction (below the\n1% level) of exposures using narrow to normal field imaging or spectroscopic\ntechniques in the visible and near IR during the first and last hours of the\nnight. Similarly, the thermal emission of the satellite would affect only a\nnegligible fraction of thermal IR observations.

However, most commonly\nconsidered adversarial examples are based on $\\ell_p$-bounded perturbations in\nthe input space of the neural network, which are unlikely to arise naturally.\nRecently, especially in computer vision, researchers discovered \"natural\" or\n\"semantic\" perturbations, such as rotations, changes of brightness, or more\nhigh-level changes, but these perturbations have not yet been systematically\nutilized to measure the performance of classifiers. In this paper, we propose\nseveral metrics to measure robustness of classifiers to natural adversarial\nexamples, and methods to evaluate them.

Firstly, we focus on the\ncase of the unit disk and prove a general boundary rigidity theorem for\nconformal pseudometrics with variable curvature. In its simplest cases this\nresult already includes new types of boundary versions of the lemmas of\nSchwarz-Pick, Ahlfors-Schwarz and Nehari-Schwarz. The proof is based on a new\nHarnack-type inequality as well as a boundary Hopf lemma for conformal\npseudometrics which extend earlier interior rigidity results of Golusin, Heins,\nBeardon, Minda and others. Secondly, we prove similar rigidity theorems for\nsequences of conformal pseudometrics, which even in the interior case appear to\nbe new. For instance, a first sequential version of the strong form of Ahlfors'\nlemma is obtained. As an auxiliary tool we establish a Hurwitz-type result\nabout preservation of zeros of sequences of conformal pseudometrics.

To\nfacilitate the modeling of these triples, we further propose a novel\nencoder-decoder based generative adversarial learning framework, Posterior\nGenerative Adversarial Network (Posterior-GAN), which consists of a forward and\na backward generative discriminator to cooperatively encourage the generated\nresponse to be informative and coherent by two complementary assessment\nperspectives.

Its host star, Proxima\nCentauri, is however a strongly flaring star, which is expected to provide a\nvery hostile environment for potentially habitable planets. We perform a\nhabitability study of Proxima Centauri b assuming an Earth-like atmosphere\nunder high stellar particle bombardment, with a focus on spectral transmission\nfeatures. We employ our extensive model suite calculating energy spectra of\nstellar particles, their journey through the planetary magnetosphere,\nionosphere, and atmosphere, ultimately providing planetary climate and spectral\ncharacteristics, as outlined in Herbst et al. (2019). Our results suggest that\ntogether with the incident stellar energy flux, high particle influxes can lead\nto efficient heating of the planet well into temperate climates, by limiting\nCH$_4$ amounts, which would otherwise run into anti-greenhouse for such planets\naround M-stars. We identify some key spectral features relevant for future\nspectral observations: First, NO$_2$ becomes the major absorber in the visible,\nwhich greatly impacts the Rayleigh slope. Second, H$_2$O features can be masked\nby CH$_4$ (near infra-red) and CO$_2$ (mid to far infra-red), making them\nnon-detectable in transmission. Third, O$_3$ is destroyed and instead HNO$_3$\nfeatures become clearly visible in the mid to far infra-red. Lastly, assuming a\nfew percent of CO$_2$ in the atmosphere, CO$_2$ absorption at 5.3 $\\mu$m\nbecomes significant (for flare and non-flare cases), strongly overlapping with\na flare related NO feature in Earth's atmosphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Mar 2020 12:27:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-21"}

We show that these SEDs cannot be\nexplained with a single electron population model when the Doppler boosting\neffect is either considered or not. By adding a more energetic electron (the\nleptonic model) or proton (the hadronic model) population, the SEDs of all\nknots are well represented. In the leptonic model, the electron population that\ncontributes the X-ray emission is more energetic than the one responsible for\nthe radio-optical emission by almost two orders of magnitude; the derived\nequipartition magnetic field strengths (B_eq) are ~0.1 mG. In the hadronic\nmodel, the protons with energy of ~20 PeV are required to interpret the\nobserved X-rays; the B_eq values are several mG, larger than that in the\nleptonic model. Based on the fact that no resolved substructures are observed\nin these knots and the fast cooling-time of the high-energy electrons is\ndifficult to explain the observed X-ray morphologies, we argue that two\ndistinct electron populations accelerated in these knots are unreasonable and\ntheir X-ray emission would be attributed to the proton synchrotron radiation\naccelerated in these knots.

Due to channel fading, power control is crucial in\nAirComp. Prior works assume that the signals to be aggregated from each device,\ni.e., local gradients have identical statistics. In FL, however, gradient\nstatistics vary over both training iterations and feature dimensions, and are\nunknown in advance. This paper studies the power control problem for\nover-the-air FL by taking gradient statistics into account. The goal is to\nminimize the aggregation error by optimizing the transmit power at each device\nsubject to peak power constraints. We obtain the optimal policy in closed form\nwhen gradient statistics are given. Notably, we show that the optimal transmit\npower is continuous and monotonically decreases with the squared multivariate\ncoefficient of variation (SMCV) of gradient vectors.

We provide global hot star wind models of central stars of\nplanetary nebulae. The models predict wind structure including the mass-loss\nrates, terminal velocities, and emergent fluxes from basic stellar parameters.\nWe applied our wind code for parameters corresponding to evolutionary stages\nbetween the asymptotic giant branch and white dwarf phases. We study the\ninfluence of metallicity and wind inhomogeneities (clumping) on the wind\nproperties. Line-driven winds appear very early after the star leaves the\nasymptotic giant branch (at the latest for $T_\\rm{eff}\\approx10\\,$kK) and fade\naway at the white dwarf cooling track (below $T_\\rm{eff}=105\\,$kK). Their\nmass-loss rate mostly scales with the stellar luminosity and, consequently, the\nmass-loss rate only varies slightly during the transition from the red to the\nblue part of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. There are the following two\nexceptions to the monotonic behavior: a bistability jump at around $20\\,$kK,\nwhere the mass-loss rate decreases by a factor of a few (during evolution) due\nto a change in iron ionization, and an additional maximum at about\n$T_\\rm{eff}=40-50\\,$kK. On the other hand, the terminal velocity increases from\nabout a few hundreds of $\\rm{km}\\,\\rm{s}^{-1}$ to a few thousands of\n$\\rm{km}\\,\\rm{s}^{-1}$ during the transition as a result of stellar radius\ndecrease. The wind terminal velocity also significantly increases at the\nbistability jump. Derived wind parameters reasonably agree with observations.\nThe effect of clumping is stronger at the hot side of the bistability jump than\nat the cool side. Derived fits to wind parameters can be used in evolutionary\nmodels and in studies of planetary nebula formation. A predicted bistability\njump in mass-loss rates can cause the appearance of an additional shell of\nplanetary nebula.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Mar 2020 14:22:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-08"}

Topographical differences in the oil surface cause water\nmicrodroplets to rigorously self-propel long distances, continuously\nredistributing the oil film and potentially refreshing the surface for\nre-nucleation. Using high-speed microscopy, we reveal that during water\ncondensation on LISs, the smallest visible droplets (diameter ~ 1um,\nqualitatively representing nucleation) predominantly emerge in oil-poor regions\ndue to a smaller thermal activation barrier. Considering the significant heat\ntransfer performance of microdroplets (< 10um) and transient characteristic of\nmicrodroplet movement, we compare the apparent nucleation rate density and\nwater collection rate for LISs with oils of different viscosity and a solid\nhydrophobic surface at a wide range of subcooling temperatures. Generally, the\nlowest lubricant viscosity leads to the highest nucleation rate density. We\ncharacterize the length and frequency of microdroplet movement and attribute\nthe nucleation enhancement primarily to higher droplet mobility and surface\nrefreshing frequency. Interestingly and unexpectedly, hydrophobic surfaces\noutperform high-viscosity LISs at high subcooling temperatures, but are\ngenerally inferior to any of the tested LISs at low temperature differences. To\nexplain the observed non-linearity between LISs and the solid hydrophobic\nsurface, we introduce two dominant regimes that influence the condensation\nefficiency: mobility-limited and coalescence-limited.

This allows one to address questions\nconcerning the correlations between the collisional events. The joint\ndistribution is found to satisfy a Fluctuation theorem of the\nJarzynski-W\\'ojcik type. Rather surprisingly, this fluctuation theorem links\nthe statistics of multiple collisions with that of independent single\ncollisions, even though the heat exchanges are statistically correlated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Mar 2020 15:59:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

One of the essential\nchallenges is early detection, which is very important for treatment success.\nUnfortunately, the exact identification of the diabetic retinopathy stage is\nnotoriously tricky and requires expert human interpretation of fundus images.\nSimplification of the detection step is crucial and can help millions of\npeople. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been successfully applied in\nmany adjacent subjects, and for diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy itself.\nHowever, the high cost of big labeled datasets, as well as inconsistency\nbetween different doctors, impede the performance of these methods. In this\npaper, we propose an automatic deep-learning-based method for stage detection\nof diabetic retinopathy by single photography of the human fundus.\nAdditionally, we propose the multistage approach to transfer learning, which\nmakes use of similar datasets with different labeling. The presented method can\nbe used as a screening method for early detection of diabetic retinopathy with\nsensitivity and specificity of 0.99 and is ranked 54 of 2943 competing methods\n(quadratic weighted kappa score of 0.925466) on APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection\nDataset (13000 images).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 2020 21:17:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-06"}

These\narchitectures are ideal for dense layers with fewer than roughly a thousand\nneurons. However, for large sparse layers, crossbar architectures are highly\ninefficient. A new hardware architecture, dubbed the MN3 (Memristive Nanowire\nNeural Network), was recently described as an efficient architecture for\nsimulating very wide, sparse neural network layers, on the order of millions of\nneurons per layer. The MN3 utilizes a high-density memristive nanowire mesh to\nefficiently connect large numbers of silicon neurons with modifiable weights.\nHere, in order to explore the MN3's ability to function as a deep neural\nnetwork, we describe one algorithm for training deep MN3 models and benchmark\nsimulations of the architecture on two deep learning tasks. We utilize a simple\npiecewise linear memristor model, since we seek to demonstrate that training\nis, in principle, possible for randomized nanowire architectures. In future\nwork, we intend on utilizing more realistic memristor models, and we will adapt\nthe presented algorithm appropriately. We show that the MN3 is capable of\nperforming composition, gradient propagation, and weight updates, which\ntogether allow it to function as a deep neural network.

Two ways to approach generalized quantum\nstatistics: (1) in quantum mechanics, generalize the permutation symmetry of\nthe wave function and (2) in statistical mechanics, generalize the maximum\noccupation number of quantum statistics. The connection between these two\napproaches, however, is obscure. In this paper, we suggest a unified framework\nto describe various kinds of generalized quantum statistics. We first provide a\ngeneral formula of canonical partition functions of ideal $N$-particle gases\nobeying various kinds of generalized quantum statistics. Then we reveal the\nconnection between the permutation phase of the wave function and the maximum\noccupation number, through constructing a method to obtain the permutation\nphase and the maximum occupation number from the canonical partition function.\nIn our scheme, the permutation phase of wave functions is generalized to a\nmatrix phase, rather than a number. It is commonly accepted that different\nkinds of statistics are distinguished by the maximum number. We show that the\nmaximum occupation number is not sufficient to distinguish different kinds of\ngeneralized quantum statistics. As examples, we discuss a series of generalized\nquantum statistics in the unified framework, giving the corresponding canonical\npartition functions, maximum occupation numbers, and the permutation phase of\nwave functions.

With the recent advance in\nneural networks, we model forecasts aggregation as a machine translation task,\nthat translates from a sequence of individual forecasts into aggregated\nforecasts, based on proposed Anchor Attention between questions and\nforecasters.

The equation of motion of the lattice is transformed according to a\nunitary approach aimed to identify equivalent non-local continuum models of\nintegral-differential and gradient type, the latter obtained through standard\nor enhanced continualization. The bilateral Z-transform of the difference\nequation of motion is matched to the governing integral-differential equation\nof the equivalent continuum in the transformed Fourier space, which has the\nsame frequency band structure as the Lagrangian one. Firstly, it is shown that\nthe approximation of the kernels via Taylor polynomials leads to the\ndifferential field equations of higher order continua endowed with non-local\nconstitutive terms. The field equations derived from such approach corresponds\nto the ones obtained through the so called standard continualization. However,\nthe differential problem turns out to be ill-posed because the non-positive\ndefiniteness of the potential energy density of the higher order continuum.\nEnergetically consistent equivalent continua have been identified through a\nproper mapping correlating the transformed macro-displacements in the Fourier\nspace with a new auxiliary regularizing continuum macro-displacement field in\nthe same space. Specifically, the mapping here introduced has zeros at the edge\nof the first Brillouin zone. The integral-differential governing equation and\nthe corresponding differential one has been reformulated through an enhanced\ncontinualization that is characterized by energetically consistent differential\nequations. The constitutive and inertial kernels of the integral-differential\nequation exhibit polar singularities at the edge of the first Brillouin zone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Mar 2020 12:55:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-08"}
