However, these works impose the\nsame sparsity regularization on all filters indiscriminately, which can hardly\nresult in an optimal structure-sparse network. In this paper, we propose a\nSaliency-Adaptive Sparsity Learning (SASL) approach for further optimization. A\nnovel and effective estimation of each filter, i.e., saliency, is designed,\nwhich is measured from two aspects: the importance for the prediction\nperformance and the consumed computational resources. During sparsity learning,\nthe regularization strength is adjusted according to the saliency, so our\noptimized format can better preserve the prediction performance while zeroing\nout more computation-heavy filters. The calculation for saliency introduces\nminimum overhead to the training process, which means our SASL is very\nefficient. During the pruning phase, in order to optimize the proposed\ndata-dependent criterion, a hard sample mining strategy is utilized, which\nshows higher effectiveness and efficiency.

The large disparity in\nphysical conditions (i.e. density, gas temperature) in the ISM triggers an\nevolution of dust properties. The analysis of how dust evolves with the\nphysical conditions is a stepping-stone towards a more thorough understanding\nof interstellar dust. The aim of this paper is to highlight dust evolution in\nthe Horsehead Nebula PDR region. We use Spitzer/IRAC (3.6, 4.5, 5.8 and 8\n{\\mu}m), Spitzer/MIPS (24 {\\mu}m) together with Herschel/PACS (70 and 160\n{\\mu}m) and Herschel/SPIRE (250, 350 and 500 {\\mu}m) to map the spatial\ndistribution of dust in the Horsehead over the entire emission spectral range.\nWe model dust emission and scattering using the THEMIS interstellar dust model\ntogether with the 3D radiative transfer code SOC. We find that the nano-grains\ndust-to-gas ratio in the irradiated outer part of the Horsehead is 6 to 10\ntimes lower than in the diffuse ISM. Their minimum size is 2 to 2.25 times\nlarger than in the diffuse ISM and the power-law exponent of their size\ndistribution, 1.1 to 1.4 times lower than in the diffuse ISM. Regarding the\ndenser part of the Horsehead, it is necessary to use evolved grains (i.e.\naggregates, with or without an ice mantle). It is not possible to explain the\nobservations using grains from the diffuse medium. We therefore propose the\nfollowing scenario to explain our results. In the outer part of the Horsehead,\nall the nano-grains have not yet had time to re-form completely through\nphoto-fragmentation of aggregates and the smallest of the nano-grains that are\nsensitive to the radiation field are photo-destroyed. In the inner part of the\nHorsehead, grains most likely consist of multi-compositional, mantled\naggregates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Mar 2020 17:06:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-29"}

In this work, we explore an optimal method for capturing the\nscene HDR and disparity map using dual camera setups. Hasinoff et al. (2010)\nhave developed a noise optimal framework for HDR capture from a single camera.\nWe generalize this to the dual camera set-up for estimating both HDR and\ndisparity map. It may seem that dual camera systems can capture HDR in a\nshorter time. However, disparity estimation is a necessary step, which requires\noverlap among the images captured by the two cameras. This may lead to an\nincrease in the capture time. To address this conflicting requirement, we\npropose a novel framework to find the optimal exposure and ISO sequence by\nminimizing the capture time under the constraints of an upper bound on the\ndisparity error and a lower bound on the per-exposure SNR. We show that the\nresulting optimization problem is non-convex in general and propose an\nappropriate initialization technique. To obtain the HDR and disparity map from\nthe optimal capture sequence, we propose a pipeline which alternates between\nestimating the camera ICRFs and the scene disparity map. We demonstrate that\nour optimal capture sequence leads to better results than other possible\ncapture sequences. Our results are also close to those obtained by capturing\nthe full stereo stack spanning the entire dynamic range. Finally, we present\nfor the first time a stereo HDR dataset consisting of dense ISO and exposure\nstack captured from a smartphone dual camera. The dataset consists of 6 scenes,\nwith an average of 142 exposure-ISO image sequence per scene.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Mar 2020 17:14:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-13"}

A parallel solver for\nsteady Stokes flow equations based on the boundary-element method is used for\nsimulating these flows. A simple transformation is introduced to extend the\npredictive capability of the solver to cases with small unsteadiness. Flows\ninduced by four simple robot shapes are investigated: sphere, upright cylinder,\nhorizontally-laid cylinder, and five-pointed star-shaped prism. Shapes with\ncross-sections that are axisymmetric about the rotation axis (sphere and\nupright cylinder) generate time-invariant flow fields, which could be useful\nfor applications such as micromanipulation. Non-axisymmetric shapes\n(horizontally-laid cylinder and the star-shaped prism) induce significant\nunsteadiness inside the flow field, which could be desirable for applications\nsuch as micromixing. Furthermore, a slender horizontally-laid cylinder\ngenerates substantially three-dimensional flows, an added benefit for\nmicromixing applications. The presence of nearby walls such as a bottom\nsubstrate or sidewalls has a retarding effect on the induced flows, which is\nquantified.

In this paper, we wish to address this\nneed by designing a semi-automatic software program for applying reliable\nsegmentation of 8 different macular layers as well as outlining retinal\npathologies such as diabetic macular edema. The software accommodates a novel\ngraph-based semi-automatic method, called ''Livelayer'' which is designed for\nstraightforward segmentation of retinal layers and fluids. This method is\nchiefly based on Dijkstra's Shortest Path (SPF) algorithm and the Live-wire\nfunction together with some preprocessing operations on the to-be-segmented\nimages. The software is indeed suitable for obtaining detailed segmentation of\nlayers, exact localization of clear or unclear fluid objects and the ground\ntruth, demanding far less endeavor in comparison to a common manual\nsegmentation method. It is also valuable as a tool for calculating the\nirregularity index in deformed OCT images. The amount of time (seconds) that\nLivelayer required for segmentation of ILM, IPL-INL, OPL-ONL was much less than\nthat for the manual segmentation, 5s for the ILM (minimum) and 15.57s for the\nOPL-ONL (maximum). The unsigned errors (pixels) between the semi-automatically\nlabeled and gold standard data was on average 2.7, 1.9, 2.1 for ILM, IPL-INL,\nOPL-ONL, respectively. The Bland-Altman plots indicated perfect concordance\nbetween the Livelayer and the manual algorithm and that they could be used\ninterchangeably. The repeatability error was around one pixel for the OPL-ONL\nand < 1 for the other two. The dice scores for comparing the two algorithms and\nfor obtaining the repeatability on segmentation of fluid objects were at\nacceptable levels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Mar 2020 17:28:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 5 Apr 2020 06:11:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2021 16:37:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-16"}

However, most current\nretrieval algorithm rely on 1D forward models that are unable to model this\neffect. We thus investigate how the 3D structure of the atmosphere biases the\nabundances retrieved using commonly used algorithms. We study the case of\nWasp-121b as a prototypical ultra hot Jupiter. We use the simulations of this\nplanet performed with the SPARC/MIT global climate model (GCM) and generate\ntransmission spectra that fully account for the 3D structure of the atmosphere\nwith Pytmopsh3R.

We find that such ultra hot jupiter's transmission spectra exhibit muted\nH$_2$O features that originate in the night-side where the temperature, hence\nthe scale-height, is smaller than on the day-side. However, the spectral\nfeatures of molecules present on the day-side are boosted by both its high\ntemperature and low mean molecular weight. As a result, the retrieved\nparameters are strongly biased compared to the ground truth. In particular the\n[CO]/[H$_2$O] is overestimated by one to three orders of magnitude. This must\nbe kept in mind when using such retrieval analysis to infer the C/O ratio of a\nplanet's atmosphere. We also discuss whether indicators can allow us to infer\nthe 3D structure of an observed atmosphere. Finally we show that HST/WFC3\ntransmission data of Wasp-121b are compatible with the day-night thermal and\ncompositional dichotomy predicted by models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Mar 2020 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-29"}

Rev. X \\textbf{8}, 031015, (2018)), we\nstudy its non-Abelian generalizations, namely QCD$_3$-Chern-Simons quantum\nphase transitions of fractional Chern insulators. These phase transitions are\ndescribed by Dirac fermions interacting with non-Abelian Chern-Simons gauge\nfields ($U(N)$, $SU(N)$, $USp(N)$, etc.). Utilizing the level-rank duality of\nChern-Simons gauge theory and non-Abelian parton constructions, we discuss two\ntypes of QCD$_3$ quantum phase transitions. The first type happens between two\nAbelian states in different Jain sequences, as opposed to the QED3 transitions\nbetween Abelian states in the same Jain sequence. A good example is the\ntransition between $\\sigma^{xy}=1/3$ state and $\\sigma^{xy}=-1$ state, which\nhas $N_f=2$ Dirac fermions interacting with a $U(2)$ Chern-Simons gauge field.\nThe second type is naturally involving non-Abelian states. For the sake of\nexperimental feasibility, we focus on transitions of Pfaffian-like states,\nincluding the Moore-Read Pfaffian, anti-Pfaffian, particle-hole Pfaffian, etc.\nThese quantum phase transitions could be realized in experimental systems such\nas fractional Chern insulators in graphene heterostructures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Mar 2020 18:03:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-09"}

Thanks to deep all-sky\nsurveys, such as those by the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and\nthe Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) missions, this task is now becoming feasible\nin the nearby Universe. Here, we present a new survey, the Local AGN Survey\n(LASr), with the goal of identifying AGN unbiased against obscuration and\ndetermining the intrinsic Compton-thick (CT) fraction. First, we construct the\nmost complete all-sky sample of galaxies within 100 Mpc from astronomical\ndatabases (90% completeness for log M_star/M_sun ~9.4), four times deeper than\nthe current local galaxy reference, the Two Micron All-Sky Survey Redshift\nSurvey (2MRS), which turns out to miss 20% of known luminous AGN. These 49k\ngalaxies serve as parent sample for LASr, called LASr-GPS. It contains 4.3k\nalready known AGN, >=82% of these are estimated to have L(12um) < 10^42.3\nerg/s, i.e., are low-luminosity AGN. As a first method for identifying\nSeyfert-like AGN, we use WISE-based infrared colours, finding 221 galaxies at\nL(12um) >= 10^42.3 erg/s to host an AGN at 90% reliability, This includes 61\nnew AGN candidates and implies and optical type 2 fraction of 50 to 71%.

To obtain clean\nhigh-resolution (HR) images, one can either use microscopy techniques, such as\nstructured-illumination microscopy (SIM), or apply denoising and\nsuper-resolution (SR) algorithms. However, the former option requires multiple\nshots that can damage the samples, and although efficient deep learning based\nalgorithms exist for the latter option, no benchmark exists to evaluate these\nalgorithms on the joint denoising and SR (JDSR) tasks. To study JDSR on\nmicroscopy data, we propose such a novel JDSR dataset, Widefield2SIM (W2S),\nacquired using a conventional fluorescence widefield and SIM imaging. W2S\nincludes 144,000 real fluorescence microscopy images, resulting in a total of\n360 sets of images. A set is comprised of noisy low-resolution (LR) widefield\nimages with different noise levels, a noise-free LR image, and a corresponding\nhigh-quality HR SIM image. W2S allows us to benchmark the combinations of 6\ndenoising methods and 6 SR methods. We show that state-of-the-art SR networks\nperform very poorly on noisy inputs. Our evaluation also reveals that applying\nthe best denoiser in terms of reconstruction error followed by the best SR\nmethod does not necessarily yield the best final result. Both quantitative and\nqualitative results show that SR networks are sensitive to noise and the\nsequential application of denoising and SR algorithms is sub-optimal.

In contrast to previously studied cases\nwith pure onsite nonlinearities, the transmission coefficient for stationary\ntransmission is shown to be a multivalued function of the transmitted\nintensity, in regimes of low saturability and small or moderate transmitted\nintensity. The corresponding backward transfer map is analyzed analytically and\nnumerically, and shown to have either one or three distinct solutions for\nsaturable coupling, and zero or two solutions for the purely cubic nonlinear\ncoupling.

The model also\nnecessarily predicts some dark radiation, which can be sizable for certain\nchoices of discrete parameters in the model. We analyze this model in detail\nusing publicly available codes - ModeChord and CosmoMC with the latest\nPlanck+BICEP2/Keck array data to constrain the model parameters and $N_{\\rm\npivot}$ (the number of $e$-foldings between horizon exit of the CMB pivot mode\nand the end of inflation). We also carry out the same analysis using the\npublicly available code Cobaya. We find the results of both the analysis to be\nin agreement. Our analysis provides the basic methods necessary to extract\nprecise inflationary prediction in string models incorporating correlations\nbetween model parameters and postinflationary evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Mar 2020 18:32:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Dec 2020 07:30:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-01"}

WFIRST will fly a focal plane\ncontaining 18 Teledyne H4RG-10 near infrared detector arrays, which present\ndifferent instrument calibration challenges from previous weak lensing\nobservations. Previous work has shown that correlation functions of flat field\nimages are effective tools for disentangling linear and non-linear inter-pixel\ncapacitance (IPC) and the brighter-fatter effect (BFE). Here we present a\nFourier-domain treatment of the flat field correlations, which allows us to\nexpand the previous formalism to all orders in IPC, BFE, and classical\nnon-linearity. We show that biases in simulated flat field analyses in Paper I\nare greatly reduced through the use of this formalism. We then apply this\nupdated formalism to flat field data from three WFIRST flight candidate\ndetectors, and explore the robustness to variations in the analysis. We find\nthat the BFE is present in all three detectors, and that its contribution to\nthe flat field correlations dominates over the non-linear IPC. The magnitude of\nthe BFE is such that the effective area of a pixel is increased by\n$(3.54\\pm0.03)\\times 10^{-7}$ for every electron deposited in a neighboring\npixel. We compare IPC maps from flat field autocorrelation measurements to\nthose obtained from the single pixel reset method and find a median difference\nof 0.113%.

When planning a study that will be analyzed with\nmarginal structural modeling, determining the required sample size for a given\nlevel of statistical power is challenging because of the effect of weighting on\nthe variance of the estimated causal means. This paper considers the utility of\nthe design effect to quantify the effect of weighting on the precision of\ncausal estimates. The design effect is defined as the ratio of the variance of\nthe causal mean estimator divided by the variance of a naive estimator if,\ncounter to fact, no confounding had been present and weights were not needed. A\nsimple, closed-form approximation of the design effect is derived that is\noutcome invariant and can be estimated during the study design phase. Once the\ndesign effect is approximated for each treatment group, sample size\ncalculations are conducted as for a randomized trial, but with variances\ninflated by the design effects to account for weighting.

A common feature of these models is\nthe presence of inaccessible information, as captured by the concept of\npreparation contextuality: There are ensembles of quantum states described by\nthe same density operator, and hence operationally indistinguishable, and yet\nin any probabilistic (ontological) model, they should be described by distinct\nprobability distributions. In this work, we quantify the inaccessible\ninformation of a model in terms of the maximum distinguishability of\nprobability distributions associated to any pair of ensembles with identical\ndensity operators, as quantified by the total variation distance of the\ndistributions. We obtain a family of lower bounds on this maximum\ndistinguishability in terms of experimentally measurable quantities. In the\ncase of an ideal qubit this leads to a lower bound of, approximately, 0.07.\nThese bounds can also be interpreted as a new class of robust preparation\nnon-contextuality inequalities. Our non-contextuality inequalities are phrased\nin terms of generalizations of max-relative entropy and trace distance for\ngeneral operational theories, which could be of independent interest.\n  Under sufficiently strong noise any quantum system becomes preparation\nnon-contextual, i.e., can be described by models with zero inaccessible\ninformation. Using our non-contextuality inequalities, we show that this can\nhappen only if the noise channel has the average gate fidelity less than or\nequal to 1/D(1+1/2+...+1/D), where D is the dimension of the Hilbert space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Mar 2020 19:23:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-16"}

Training itself is governed by many hyperparameters.There has been\nsurprisingly little research on design choices for hyper-parameter values and\nloss-functions, presumably because of the prohibitive computational cost to\nexplore the parameter space. In this paper, we investigate 12 hyper-parameters\nin an AlphaZero-like self-play algorithm and evaluate how these parameters\ncontribute to training. We use small games, to achieve meaningful exploration\nwith moderate computational effort. The experimental results show that training\nis highly sensitive to hyper-parameter choices. Through multi-objective\nanalysis we identify 4 important hyper-parameters to further assess. To start,\nwe find surprising results where too much training can sometimes lead to lower\nperformance. Our main result is that the number of self-play iterations\nsubsumes MCTS-search simulations, game-episodes, and training epochs. The\nintuition is that these three increase together as self-play iterations\nincrease, and that increasing them individually is sub-optimal. A consequence\nof our experiments is a direct recommendation for setting hyper-parameter\nvalues in self-play: the overarching outer-loop of self-play iterations should\nbe maximized, in favor of the three inner-loop hyper-parameters, which should\nbe set at lower values. A secondary result of our experiments concerns the\nchoice of optimization goals, for which we also provide recommendations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Mar 2020 19:28:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-16"}

All self-efficacy gender differences close by the fourth year\nexcept physics self-efficacy. The disconnect between self-efficacy and course\ngrades across subjects provides useful clues for targeted interventions to\npromote equitable learning environments. The most extreme disconnect occurs in\nphysics and may help explain the severe underrepresentation of women in\n\"physics-heavy\" engineering disciplines, highlighting the importance of such\ninterventions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Mar 2020 20:25:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-18"}

Consequently, the\neffectiveness of voltage and frequency regulation in microgrids using\nconventional droop-based methodologies is challenged by uncertainty in the\nsizeand schedule of loads. This article proposes an isochronous architecture of\nparallel inverters with only voltage-active power droop (VP-D) control for\nimproving active power sharing as well as plug-and-play of multi-inverter based\ndistributed energyresources (DERs). In spite of not employing explicit control\nfor frequency regulation, this architecture allows even sharing of reactive\npower while maintaining reduced circulating currents between inverters. The\nperformance is achieved even when there are mismatches between commanded\nreference and power demanded from the actual load in the network. The\nisochronous architecture is implemented by employing a global positioning\nsystem (GPS) to disseminate timing signals that enable the microgrid to\nmaintain nominal system frequency in the entire network. This enables direct\ncontrol of active power through voltage source inverter (VSI) output voltage\nregulation, even in the presence of system disturbances. A small signal\neigenvalue analysis of a multi-inverter system near the steady-state operating\npoint is presented to evaluate the stability of the multi-inverter system with\nthe proposed VP-D control. Simulation studies and hardware experiments on an\n1.2 kVA prototype are conducted. The effectiveness of the proposed architecture\ntowards active and reactive power sharing between inverters with load scenarios\nare demonstrated. Results of the hardware experiments corroborate the viability\nof the proposed VP-D control architecture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Mar 2020 20:33:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-16"}

In this model, the effect of temperature, deposition flux,\nand strengths of atom-atom interactions are encoded in two parameters: the\ndiffusion to deposition ratio $R=D/F$ and $\\varepsilon$, which is related to\nthe probability of an adatom \"breaking\" a lateral bond. We demonstrate that the\nHDs present a strong dependence on both $R$ and $\\varepsilon$, and even after\nthe deposition of $10^5$ monolayers (MLs) they are still far from the\nasymptotics in some cases. For instance, the temporal evolution of the HDs'\nskewness (kurtosis) displays a pronounced minimum (maximum), for small $R$ and\n$\\varepsilon$, and only at long times it passes to increase (decrease) toward\nits asymptotic value. However, it is hard to determine whether they converge to\na single value or different nonuniversal ones. For large $R$ and/or\n$\\varepsilon$, on the other hand, these quantities clearly converge to the\nvalues expected for the Villain-Lai-Das Sarma (VLDS) universality class. A\nsimilar behavior is observed in the spatial covariances, but with weaker\nfinite-time effects, so that rescaled curves of them collapse quite well with\nthe one for the VLDS class at long times.

Current image processing methods are hindered by the\ntime needed to generate expert-labelled datasets and the potential for bias\nduring the analysis. Therefore, automated, robust, unbiased and timely geometry\nextraction from IVOCT, using image processing, would be beneficial to\nclinicians. With clinical application in mind, we aim to develop a model with a\nsmall memory footprint that is fast at inference time without sacrificing\nsegmentation quality. Using a large IVOCT dataset of 12,011 expert-labelled\nimages from 22 patients, we construct a new deep learning method based on\ncapsules which automatically produces lumen segmentations. Our dataset contains\nimages with both blood and light artefacts (22.8%), as well as metallic (23.1%)\nand bioresorbable stents (2.5%). We split the dataset into a training (70%),\nvalidation (20%) and test (10%) set and rigorously investigate design\nvariations with respect to upsampling regimes and input selection.

These areas are: advanced, high gradient acceleration techniques, and\nx-ray free electron lasers (XFELs). Further, there is intense interest in the\nmarriage of these two fields, with the goal of producing a very compact XFEL.\nIn this context, recent advances in high gradient radio-frequency cryogenic\ncopper structure research have opened the door to the use of surface electric\nfields between 250 and 500 MV/m. Such an approach is foreseen to enable a new\ngeneration of photoinjectors with six-dimensional beam brightness beyond the\ncurrent state-of-the-art by well over an order of magnitude. This advance is an\nessential ingredient enabling an ultra-compact XFEL (UC-XFEL). In addition, one\nmay accelerate these bright beams to GeV scale in less than 10 meters. Such an\ninjector, when combined with inverse free electron laser-based bunching\ntechniques can produce multi-kA beams with unprecedented beam quality,\nquantified by ~50 nm-rad normalized emittances. These beams, when injected into\ninnovative, short-period (1-10 mm) undulators uniquely enable UC-XFELs having\nfootprints consistent with university-scale laboratories. We describe the\narchitecture and predicted performance of this novel light source, which\npromises photon production per pulse of a few percent of existing XFEL sources.\nWe review implementation issues including collective beam effects, compact\nx-ray optics systems, and other relevant technical challenges. To illustrate\nthe potential of such a light source to fundamentally change the current\nparadigm of XFELs with their limited access, we examine possible applications\nin biology, chemistry, materials, atomic physics, industry, and medicine which\nmay profit from this new model of performing XFEL science.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Mar 2020 02:07:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2020 16:17:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 14 Aug 2020 18:03:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-28"}

We conduct a systematic comparison between the two\ndifferent approaches for the B-PINN posterior estimation (i.e., HMC or VI),\nalong with dropout used for quantifying uncertainty in deep neural networks.\nOur experiments show that HMC is more suitable than VI for the B-PINNs\nposterior estimation, while dropout employed in PINNs can hardly provide\naccurate predictions with reasonable uncertainty. Finally, we replace the BNN\nin the prior with a truncated Karhunen-Lo\\`eve (KL) expansion combined with HMC\nor a deep normalizing flow (DNF) model as posterior estimators. The KL is as\naccurate as BNN and much faster but this framework cannot be easily extended to\nhigh-dimensional problems unlike the BNN based framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Mar 2020 04:00:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-02"}

Using prior knowledge to enrich a topic model is one of potential\nsolutions to cope with these challenges. Prior knowledge that is derived from\nhuman knowledge (e.g. Wordnet) or a pre-trained model (e.g. Word2vec) is very\nvaluable and useful to help topic models work better. However, in a streaming\nenvironment where data arrives continually and infinitely, existing studies are\nlimited to exploiting these resources effectively. Especially, a knowledge\ngraph, that contains meaningful word relations, is ignored. In this paper, to\naim at exploiting a knowledge graph effectively, we propose a novel graph\nconvolutional topic model (GCTM) which integrates graph convolutional networks\n(GCN) into a topic model and a learning method which learns the networks and\nthe topic model simultaneously for data streams.

To this end, we\nfirst analyze historical data of seven major public blockchains, namely\nBitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, and\nZilliqa. We consider two metrics for concurrency, namely the single-transaction\nconflict rate per block, and the group conflict rate per block. We find that\nthere is more concurrency in UTXO-based blockchains than in account-based ones,\nalthough the amount of concurrency in the former is lower than expected.\nAnother interesting finding is that some blockchains with larger blocks have\nmore concurrency than blockchains with smaller blocks.

GearNN employs an optimization algorithm to identify\na small set of \"distortion-sensitive\" DNN parameters, given a memory budget.\nBased on the distortion level of the input, GearNN then adapts only the\ndistortion-sensitive parameters, while reusing the rest of constant parameters\nacross all input qualities. In our evaluation of DNN inference with dynamic\ninput distortions, GearNN improves the accuracy (mIoU) by an average of 18.12%\nover a DNN trained with the undistorted dataset and 4.84% over stability\ntraining from Google, with only 1.8% extra memory overhead.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Mar 2020 06:25:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-16"}

The electron density derived from the [SII] doublet is\nsignificantly lower than than that found with a method developed in the last\ndecade using auroral and transauroral lines, as well as a recently introduced\nmethod based on the ionization parameter. The reason is that, for gas\nphotoionized by an AGN, much of the [SII] emission arises in an extended\npartially ionized zone where the implicit assumption that the electron density\ntraces the hydrogen density is invalid. We propose ways to deal with this\nsituation and we derive the associated outflow rates for ionized gas, which are\nin the range 0.001--0.5 M$_{\\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ for our AGN sample.

First, we show the eligibility of a DMDP to model the control\nprocess of a BCN and the existence of an optimal solution. Next, two approaches\nare developed to handle the optimal control problem in a DMDP. One approach\nadopts the well-known value iteration algorithm, and the other resorts to the\nMadani's algorithm specifically designed for DMDPs. The latter approach can\nfind an exact optimal solution and outperform existing methods in terms of time\nefficiency, while the former value iteration based approach usually obtains a\nnear-optimal solution much faster than all others.

We tested\nthe persistence of these changes in the flaring rates with new X-ray data of\nSgr A* obtained in 2016-2018 (total exposure of 1.4Ms).

We computed the intrinsic distribution of flare\nfluxes and durations corrected for the sensitivity bias using a new method that\nallowed us to take the error on the flare fluxes and durations into account.\nFrom this intrinsic distribution, we determined the average flare detection\nefficiency for each Chandra, XMM-Newton, and Swift observation.

We\npropose PayPlace, a scalable off-chain protocol for payments between consumers\nand sellers. Using PayPlace, consumers establish a virtual unidirectional\npayment channel with an intermediary operator to pay for their transactions.\nUnlike state channels, however, the PayPlace operator can reference the\ncustodial funds accrued off-chain in these channels to in-turn make\ntamper-proof off-chain payments to merchants, without locking up corresponding\ncapital in channels with merchants.

So far, two\nchemically distinct types of Solar-like protostars have been identified: hot\ncorinos, which are enriched in interstellar Complex Organic Molecules (iCOMs),\nsuch as methanol (CH$_3$OH) or dimethyl ether (CH$_3$OCH$_3$), and Warm Carbon\nChain Chemistry (WCCC) objects, which are enriched in carbon chain molecules,\nsuch as butadiynyl (C$_4$H) or ethynyl radical (CCH). However, none of these\nhave been studied so far in environments similar to that in which our Sun was\nborn, that is, one that is close to massive stars. Aims: In this work, we\nsearch for hot corinos and WCCC objects in the closest analogue to the Sun's\nbirth environment, the Orion Molecular Cloud 2/3 (OMC-2/3) filament located in\nthe Orion A molecular cloud. Methods: We obtained single-dish observations of\nCCH and CH$_3$OH line emission towards nine Solar-like protostars in this\nregion. As in other, similar studies of late, we used the [CCH]/[CH$_3$OH]\nabundance ratio in order to determine the chemical nature of our protostar\nsample.

Semi-transitive graphs generalize several\nimportant classes of graphs and they are precisely the class of\nword-representable graphs studied extensively in the literature.\n  Determining if a triangle-free graph is semi-transitive is an NP-hard\nproblem.

Unfortunately, it still\nconsumes a huge amount of computing resources, the majority of which is spent\nin self-play. Hyperparameter tuning exacerbates the training cost since each\nhyperparameter configuration requires its own time to train one run, during\nwhich it will generate its own self-play records. As a result, multiple runs\nare usually needed for different hyperparameter configurations. This paper\nproposes using population based training (PBT) to help tune hyperparameters\ndynamically and improve strength during training time. Another significant\nadvantage is that this method requires a single run only, while incurring a\nsmall additional time cost, since the time for generating self-play records\nremains unchanged though the time for optimization is increased following the\nAlphaZero training algorithm. In our experiments for 9x9 Go, the PBT method is\nable to achieve a higher win rate for 9x9 Go than the baselines, each with its\nown hyperparameter configuration and trained individually. For 19x19 Go, with\nPBT, we are able to obtain improvements in playing strength. Specifically, the\nPBT agent can obtain up to 74% win rate against ELF OpenGo, an open-source\nstate-of-the-art AlphaZero program using a neural network of a comparable\ncapacity. This is compared to a saturated non-PBT agent, which achieves a win\nrate of 47% against ELF OpenGo under the same circumstances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Mar 2020 11:56:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-16"}

This rapid\nprogress has been possible due to the advent of powerful ground-based, and\nspace telescopes for combined study of several millimeter to far-IR, line or\ncontinuum tracers of the molecular gas and dust components. The main\nconclusions of this review are:\n  1. Star forming galaxies contained much more molecular gas at earlier cosmic\nepochs than at the present time.\n  2. The galaxy integrated depletion time scale for converting the gas into\nstars depends primarily on z or Hubble time, and at a given z, on the vertical\nlocation of a galaxy along the star-formation rate versus stellar mass\n\"main-sequence\" (MS) correlation.\n  3. Global rates of galaxy gas accretion primarily control the evolution of\nthe cold molecular gas content and star formation rates of the dominant MS\ngalaxy population, which in turn vary with the cosmological expansion. A second\nkey driver may be global disk fragmentation in high-z, gas rich galaxies, which\nties local free-fall time scales to galactic orbital times, and leads to rapid\nradial matter transport and bulge growth. Third, the low star formation\nefficiency inside molecular clouds is plausibly set by super-sonic streaming\nmotions, and internal turbulence, which in turn may be driven by conversion of\ngravitational energy at high-z, and/or by local feedback from massive stars at\nlow-z.\n  4.

Despite the growing literature on\nuplift models to identify the strongest treatment-responders, no research has\ninvestigated optimal targeting when the costs of the treatment are unknown at\nthe time of the targeting decision. Stochastic costs are ubiquitous in direct\nmarketing and customer retention campaigns because marketing incentives are\nconditioned on a positive customer response. This study makes two contributions\nto the literature, which are evaluated on an e-commerce coupon targeting\ncampaign. First, we formally analyze the targeting decision problem under\nresponse-dependent costs. Profit-optimal targeting requires an estimate of the\ntreatment effect on the customer and an estimate of the customer response\nprobability under treatment. The empirical results demonstrate that the\nconsideration of treatment cost substantially increases campaign profit when\nused for customer targeting in combination with an estimate of the average or\ncustomer-level treatment effect. Second, we propose a framework to jointly\nestimate the treatment effect and the response probability by combining methods\nfor causal inference with a hurdle mixture model.

Computer aided diagnosis helps physicians and\ndermatologists to obtain a second opinion for proper analysis and treatment of\nskin cancer. Precise segmentation of the cancerous mole along with surrounding\narea is essential for proper analysis and diagnosis. This paper is focused\ntowards the development of improved ALDS framework based on probabilistic\napproach that initially utilizes active contours and watershed merged mask for\nsegmenting out the mole and later SVM and Neural Classifier are applied for the\nclassification of the segmented mole. After lesion segmentation, the selected\nfeatures are classified to ascertain that whether the case under consideration\nis melanoma or non-melanoma. The approach is tested for varying datasets and\ncomparative analysis is performed that reflects the effectiveness of the\nproposed system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Mar 2020 13:31:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-16"}

Despite the continuous progress in the area of activity recognition in\nsmart homes, many systems make a strong underlying assumption that the number\nof occupants in the home at any given moment of time is always known.\nEstimating the number of persons in a Smart Home at each time step remains a\nchallenge nowadays. Indeed, unlike most (crowd) counting solution which are\nbased on computer vision techniques, the sensors considered in a Smart Home are\noften very simple and do not offer individually a good overview of the\nsituation. The data gathered needs therefore to be fused in order to infer\nuseful information. This paper aims at addressing this challenge and presents a\nprobabilistic approach able to estimate the number of persons in the\nenvironment at each time step. This approach works in two steps: first, an\nestimate of the number of persons present in the environment is done using a\nConstraint Satisfaction Problem solver, based on the topology of the sensor\nnetwork and the sensor activation pattern at this time point. Then, a Hidden\nMarkov Model refines this estimate by considering the uncertainty related to\nthe sensors. Using both simulated and real data, our method has been tested and\nvalidated on two smart homes of different sizes and configuration and\ndemonstrates the ability to accurately estimate the number of inhabitants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Mar 2020 15:41:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-16"}

The so-called X17 particle constitutes a virtual state in the\nprocess, preceding the emission of the electron-positron pair. Based on the\nsymmetry of the nuclear transitions ($1^+$ to $0^+$ and $0^-$ to $0^+$), the\nX17 could either be a vector, or a pseudoscalar particle. Here, we calculate\nthe effective potentials generated by the X17, for hyperfine interactions in\nsimple atomic systems, for both the pseudoscalar as well as the vector X17\nhypotheses. The effective Hamiltonians are obtained in a general form which is\napplicable to both electronic as well as muonic bound systems. The effect of\nvirtual annihilation and its contribution to the hyperfine splitting also is\nconsidered. Because of the short range of the X17-generated potentials, the\nmost promising pathway for the observation of the X17-mediated effects in bound\nsystems concerns hyperfine interactions, which, for $S$ states, are given by\nmodifications of short-range (Dirac-delta) potentials in coordinate space. For\nthe pseudoscalar hypothesis, the exchange of one virtual X17 quantum between\nthe bound lepton and the nucleus exclusively leads to hyperfine effects, but\ndoes not affect the Lamb shift. Effects due to the X17 are shown to be\ndrastically enhanced for muonic bound systems. Prospects for the detection of\nhyperfine effects mediated by X17 exchange are analyzed for muonic deuterium,\nmuonic hydrogen, muonium, true muonium ($\\mu^+\\mu^-$ bound system), and\npositronium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Mar 2020 21:30:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2020 21:12:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

The RFS control formulation assumes that the\ntopology underlying the swarm control is complete and uses the complete graph\nin a centralized manner. To generalize the control topology in a localized or\ndecentralized manner, sparse LQR is used to sparsify the RFS control gain\nmatrix obtained using iterative LQR. This allows agents to use information of\nagents near each other (localized topology) or only the agent's own information\n(decentralized topology) to make a control decision.

The resulting representations are\nthen invariant to stochastic augmentation strategies, and can be used for\ndownstream tasks such as clustering or classification. Yet data augmentations\npreserve many properties of an image and so there is potential for a suboptimal\nchoice of representation that relies on matching easy-to-find features in the\ndata. We demonstrate that greedy or local methods of maximising mutual\ninformation (such as stochastic gradient optimisation) discover local optima of\nthe mutual information criterion; the resulting representations are also\nless-ideally suited to complex downstream tasks. Earlier work has not\nspecifically identified or addressed this issue. We introduce deep hierarchical\nobject grouping (DHOG) that computes a number of distinct discrete\nrepresentations of images in a hierarchical order, eventually generating\nrepresentations that better optimise the mutual information objective. We also\nfind that these representations align better with the downstream task of\ngrouping into underlying object classes. We tested DHOG on unsupervised\nclustering, which is a natural downstream test as the target representation is\na discrete labelling of the data.

Unlike RNN and LSTM, which\ncontain inductive bias by loading the input tokens sequentially, non-recurrent\nmodels are less sensitive to position. The main reason is that position\ninformation among input units is not inherently encoded, i.e., the models are\npermutation equivalent; this problem justifies why all of the existing models\nare accompanied by a sinusoidal encoding/embedding layer at the input. However,\nthis solution has clear limitations: the sinusoidal encoding is not flexible\nenough as it is manually designed and does not contain any learnable\nparameters, whereas the position embedding restricts the maximum length of\ninput sequences. It is thus desirable to design a new position layer that\ncontains learnable parameters to adjust to different datasets and different\narchitectures. At the same time, we would also like the encodings to\nextrapolate in accordance with the variable length of inputs. In our proposed\nsolution, we borrow from the recent Neural ODE approach, which may be viewed as\na versatile continuous version of a ResNet. This model is capable of modeling\nmany kinds of dynamical systems.

To\nthis end, we take a careful look at the dynamics of WiFi signals under human\nrespiration and body motions in the wild. We first characterize the WiFi signal\ncomponents - multipath and signal subspace - that are modulated by human\nrespiration and body motions. We extrapolate on a set of transformations,\nincluding first-order differentiation, max-min normalization and component\nprojections, that faithfully explains and quantifies the dynamics of\nrespiration and body motions on WiFi signals. Grounded in this\ncharacterization, we propose two methods: 1) a respiration tracking technique\nthat models the peak dynamics observed in the time-varying signal subspaces and\n2) a body-motion tracking technique built with a multi-dimensional clustering\nof evolving signal subspaces.

Since the ABC algorithm has been developed to achieve optimal\nsolutions by searching in the continuous search space, modification is required\nto apply this method to binary optimization problems. In this paper, we improve\nthe ABC algorithm to solve binary optimization problems and call it the\nimproved binary Artificial Bee Colony (ibinABC). The proposed method consists\nof an update mechanism based on fitness values and processing different number\nof decision variables. Thus, we aim to prevent the ABC algorithm from getting\nstuck in a local minimum by increasing its exploration ability. We compare the\nibinABC algorithm with three variants of the ABC and other meta-heuristic\nalgorithms in the literature. For comparison, we use the wellknown OR-Library\ndataset containing 15 problem instances prepared for the uncapacitated facility\nlocation problem. Computational results show that the proposed method is\nsuperior to other methods in terms of convergence speed and robustness.

Advanced deep learning techniques\nachieve great progress in rapidly predicting fluid flows without prior\nknowledge of the underlying physical relationships. Advanced deep learning\ntechniques achieve great progress in rapidly predicting fluid flows without\nprior knowledge of the underlying physical relationships. However, most of\nexisting researches focused mainly on either sequence learning or spatial\nlearning, rarely on both spatial and temporal dynamics of fluid flows\n(Reichstein et al., 2019). In this work, an Artificial Intelligence (AI) fluid\nmodel based on a general deep convolutional generative adversarial network\n(DCGAN) has been developed for predicting spatio-temporal flow distributions.\nIn deep convolutional networks, the high-dimensional flows can be converted\ninto the low-dimensional \"latent\" representations. The complex features of flow\ndynamics can be captured by the adversarial networks. The above DCGAN fluid\nmodel enables us to provide reasonable predictive accuracy of flow fields while\nmaintaining a high computational efficiency. The performance of the DCGAN is\nillustrated for two test cases of Hokkaido tsunami with different incoming\nwaves along the coastal line. It is demonstrated that the results from the\nDCGAN are comparable with those from the original high fidelity model\n(Fluidity). The spatio-temporal flow features have been represented as the flow\nevolves, especially, the wave phases and flow peaks can be captured accurately.\nIn addition, the results illustrate that the online CPU cost is reduced by five\norders of magnitude compared to the original high fidelity model simulations.\nThe promising results show that the DCGAN can provide rapid and reliable\nspatio-temporal prediction for nonlinear fluid flows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Mar 2020 00:53:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

Manual annotation is always difficult for a large\nbio-medical dataset. So, we consider two cases where one dataset is fully\nlabeled and the other dataset is assumed to be fully unlabelled. We first\nperform Semantic Segmentation on the fully labeled isotropic biomedical source\ndata (FIBSEM) and try to incorporate the the trained model for segmenting the\ntarget unlabelled dataset(SNEMI3D)which shares some similarities with the\nsource dataset in the context of different types of cellular bodies and other\ncellular components. Although, the cellular components vary in size and shape.\nSo in this paper, we have proposed a novel approach in the context of\nunsupervised domain adaptation while classifying each pixel of the target\nvolumetric data into cell boundary and cell body. Also, we have proposed a\nnovel approach to giving non-uniform weights to different pixels in the\ntraining images while performing the pixel-level semantic segmentation in the\npresence of the corresponding pixel-wise label map along with the training\noriginal images in the source domain. We have used the Entropy Map or a\nDistance Transform matrix retrieved from the given ground truth label map which\nhas helped to overcome the class imbalance problem in the medical image data\nwhere the cell boundaries are extremely thin and hence, extremely prone to be\nmisclassified as non-boundary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Mar 2020 06:01:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-07"}

The new model approximates the cavity-formation energy as that of a\nshell capacitor: the inner, solute-shaped conductor is held at the static\npotential, and the outer conductor (at the first solvation shell) is held at\nzero potential. Compared to cavity energies computed using free-energy\npertubation with explicit-solvent molecular dynamics, the new model exhibits\nsurprising accuracy (Mobley test set, RMSE 0.45 kcal/mol). Combined with a\nmodified continuum model for solute-solvent van der Waals interactions, the\ntotal nonpolar model has RMSE of 0.55 kcal/mol on this test set, which is\nremarkable because the two terms largely cancel. The overall nonpolar model has\na small number of physically meaningful parameters and compares favorably to\nother published models of nonpolar solvation. Finally, when the proposed\nnonpolar model is combined with our solvation-layer interface condition (SLIC)\ncontinuum electrostatic model, which includes asymmetric solvation-shell\nresponse, we predict solvation free energies with an RMS error of 1.35 kcal/mol\nrelative to experiment, comparable to the RMS error of explicit-solvent FEP\n(1.26 kcal/mol). Moreover, all parameters in our model have a clear physical\nmeaning, and employing reasonable temperature dependencies yields remarkable\ncorrelation with solvation entropies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Mar 2020 12:29:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-28"}
