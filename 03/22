The mathematical challenge\nin these type of model systems is to match the solutions of the time-dependent\ndiffusion equation in each layer, such that the boundary conditions at the\ninterfaces between them are satisfied. As the number of layers increases, the\nsolutions may become increasingly complicated. Here, we describe an alternative\ncomputational approach to multi-layer diffusion problems, which is based on the\ndescription of the overdamped Brownian motion of particles via the underdamped\nLangevin equation. In this approach, the probability distribution function is\ncomputed from the statistics of an ensemble of independent single particle\ntrajectories. To allow for simulations of Langevin dynamics in layered systems,\nthe numerical integrator must be supplemented with algorithms for the\ntransitions across the discontinuous interfaces. Algorithms for three common\ntypes of discontinuities are presented: (i) A discontinuity in the friction\ncoefficient, (ii) a semi-permeable membrane, and (iii) a step-function chemical\npotential. The general case of an interface where all three discontinuities are\npresent (Kedem-Katchalsky boundary) is also discussed. We demonstrate the\nvalidity and accuracy of the derived algorithms by considering a simple\ntwo-layer model system and comparing the Langevin dynamics statistics with\nanalytical solutions and alternative computational results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Mar 2020 16:04:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Aug 2020 08:56:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-28"}

Further, using the RCP8.5 warming\nscenario, the results are analysed. In the future scenario, there is an\nincrease in the number of days where the summer (JJA) model temperatures exceed\n25{\\deg}C. There is a future warming of 1.2{\\deg}C (BRB) and 1.1{\\deg}C (HPC)\nin the mean JJA maximum daily temperatures compared with the control values and\nan average annual maximum daily temperature warming of 1.2{\\deg}C (BRB) and\n0.5{\\deg}C (HPC). For the control period, the model under-predicts both the\nmaximum and particularly the minimum temperatures. Results indicate there will\nbe a >25% increase in the number of summer days when the maximum temperature\nexceeds 25{\\deg}C, a 60% increase when the temperature exceeds the minimum of\n13{\\deg}C, (Tables 3, 4) and an increase in heat wave events per annum of\ngreater than 10 days, [Gadian et al. 2018]. The increases in summer\ntemperatures are larger than those predicted in the 2013 IPCC assessment\n[Collins et al 2013], but consistent with the maximum temperatures and\nincreased number of hot days listed in UKCP18 [Met Office 2019(b)]. The higher\nresolution model results suggest that the IPCC report underestimates the\nincreases in maximum temperatures at these locations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Mar 2020 17:10:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-24"}

The spectra of SN 2013L are dominated by H emission features\ncharacterized by three components attributed to different regions. A unique\nfeature of this Type IIn SN is that the blue shifted line profile is dominated\nby the macroscopic velocity of the expanding shock wave of the SN. We are\ntherefore able to trace the evolution of the shock velocity in the dense and\npartially opaque circumstellar medium (CSM), from $\\sim 4800~km~s^{-1}$ at +48\nd, decreasing as $t^{-0.23}$ to $\\sim 2700~km~s^{-1}$ after a year. We perform\nspectral modeling of both the broad- and intermediate-velocity components of\nthe H$\\alpha$ line profile. The high-velocity component is consistent with\nemission from a radially thin, spherical shell located behind the expanding\nshock with emission wings broadened by electron scattering. We propose that the\nintermediate component originates from pre-ionized gas from the unshocked dense\nCSM with the same velocity as the narrow component, $\\sim 100~km~s^{-1}$, but\nalso broadened by electron scattering. The spectral energy distributions (SEDs)\nof SN 2013L after +132 d are well reproduced by a two-component black-body (BB)\nmodel.

In this paper, the general analytic conditions are provided. The paper\nshows that both these two new conditions (the extended observability rank\ncondition and the extended controllability rank condition) reduce to the well\nknown rank conditions for observability and controllability in the two simpler\ncases of time-varying linear systems and time-invariant nonlinear systems. The\nproposed new conditions work automatically and can deal with any system,\nindependently of its complexity (state dimension, type of nonlinearity, etc).\nSimple examples illustrate both these conditions. In addition, the two new\nconditions are used to study the observability and the controllability\nproperties of a lunar module. For this system, the dynamics exhibit an explicit\ntime-dependence due to the variation of the weight and the variation of the\nmoment of inertia.

Furthermore, in accordance\nwith a V2X network being inherently dynamic in key parameters such as vehicle\ndensity and velocity, the networking behavior of a DSRC system is usually\nhighly complicated to analyze. In addition, the United States Federal\nCommunications Commission (US FCC) recently announced the \"5.9 GHz band\nreform,\" which reduced the dedicated bandwidth for DSRC to 10 MHz from 75 MHz.\nMotivated from these, the necessity of \"lightening\" the networking load of a\nDSRC network has become essential to keep safety-related operations without\nperformance deterioration. To this end, this paper proposes a protocol that\nprioritizes transmission of a basic safety message (BSM) at a vehicle according\nto the level of danger that the vehicle experiences. The proposed protocol uses\nthe distance between a danger source and a vehicle as the metric to determine\nthe priority for transmission.

In ferromagnetic Fe and Ni the longitudinal\nspin dynamics is governed by interactions between low-energy intraband\nelectron-hole pairs while in quasi two dimensional antiferromagnet FeSe it is\ndominated by the interband transitions with energies of the order of exchange\nsplitting. In the later material, the collective longitudinal magnetization\nfluctuations feature well defined energies and long life times for small\nmomenta and appear below the particle-hole continuum. The modes become strongly\nLandau-damped for growing wave-vectors. We relate our theoretical findings to\nexisting experimental spin-polarized electron energy loss spectroscopy results.\nIn bulk bcc Fe, the longitudinal magnetic modes appear above the typical\nenergies of transverse spin-waves, have energies comparable with the Stoner\nspin-flip excitation continuum, and are order of magnitude less energetic than\nthe charge dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Mar 2020 19:43:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 2020 18:57:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2020 08:24:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

In many hot, dilute astrophysical\nsystems, such as the intracluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters, the rarity\nof particle--particle collisions allows departures from local thermodynamic\nequilibrium. These departures exert anisotropic viscous stresses on the plasma\nmotions that inhibit their ability to stretch magnetic-field lines. We present\na numerical study of the fluctuation dynamo in a weakly collisional plasma\nusing magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations endowed with a field-parallel viscous\n(Braginskii) stress. When the stress is limited to values consistent with a\npressure anisotropy regulated by firehose and mirror instabilities, the\nBraginskii-MHD dynamo largely resembles its MHD counterpart. If instead the\nparallel viscous stress is left unabated -- a situation relevant to recent\nkinetic simulations of the fluctuation dynamo and to the early stages of the\ndynamo in a magnetized ICM -- the dynamo changes its character, amplifying the\nmagnetic field while exhibiting many characteristics of the saturated state of\nthe large-Prandtl-number (${\\rm Pm}\\gtrsim{1}$) MHD dynamo. We construct an\nanalytic model for the Braginskii-MHD dynamo in this regime, which successfully\nmatches magnetic-energy spectra. A prediction of this model, confirmed by our\nsimulations, is that a Braginskii-MHD plasma without pressure-anisotropy\nlimiters will not support a dynamo if the ratio of perpendicular and parallel\nviscosities is too small. This ratio reflects the relative allowed rates of\nfield-line stretching and mixing, the latter of which promotes resistive\ndissipation of the magnetic field. In all cases that do exhibit a dynamo, the\ngenerated magnetic field is organized into folds that persist into the\nsaturated state and bias the chaotic flow to acquire a scale-dependent spectral\nanisotropy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Mar 2020 22:17:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Jul 2020 16:41:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-23"}

For on-street parking, we developed (1) a deep-learning\nmodel of block-by-block parking availability based on data from parking meters\nand audits and (2) a computational simulation of drivers searching for an\non-street spot. For off-street parking, we developed a computational simulation\nof the time it would take drivers drive from their original destination to the\nnearest city-owned off-street lot and then to queue for a spot based on traffic\nand lot occupancy data. Finally, in both cases we also computed the time it\nwould take the driver to walk from their parking spot to their original\ndestination. We compared these time estimates for destinations in each block of\nVancouver's downtown core and each hour of the day. We found many areas where\noff street would actually save drivers time over searching the streets for a\nspot, and many more where the time cost for parking off street was small.

The innovation in DMSTF is that we\nparameterize weights in terms of a deep Markovian prior extendable with a\ndiscrete latent, which is able to characterize nonlinear multimodal temporal\ndynamics, and perform multidimensional time series forecasting. DMSTF learns a\nlow dimensional spatial latent to generatively parameterize spatial factors or\ntheir functional forms in order to accommodate high spatial dimensionality.

With the aim of providing a comprehensive overview for researchers who\nare interested in developing a deep-learning-based analysis system for power\nlines inspection data, this paper conducts a thorough review of the current\nliterature and identifies the challenges for future research. Following the\ntypical procedure of inspection data analysis, we categorize current works in\nthis area into component detection and fault diagnosis. For each aspect, the\ntechniques and methodologies adopted in the literature are summarized. Some\nvaluable information is also included such as data description and method\nperformance. Further, an in-depth discussion of existing deep-learning-related\nanalysis methods in power lines inspection is proposed. Finally, we conclude\nthe paper with several research trends for the future of this area, such as\ndata quality problems, small object detection, embedded application, and\nevaluation baseline.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Mar 2020 04:09:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-18"}

The\nLifshitz transition is initiated by the appearance of new electron pockets on\nthe Fermi surface, which evolve with pressure and connect to the adjacent\nelectron pockets forming an umbrella shaped Fermi surface at the top and bottom\nof the Brillouin zone. An unusual giant phonon softening (Ag mode) concomitant\nwith a V-shaped Tc behavior appears at 10-12 GPa as a result of the interaction\nof optical phonons with the conduction electrons, resulting in Fano line shaped\nasymmetry in Ag mode.

We extend our architecture to support dynamic re-lighting and\ncomposition with other 3d objects in the scene. We designed a network that\nefficiently generates multiple scene feature maps such as normals, depth,\nalbedo and mask, which are composed with other scene objects to form the final\nimage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Mar 2020 06:28:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-24"}

To explicitly address these issues, in\nthis paper, a Broadening-and-Shrinking One-Shot NAS (BS-NAS) framework is\nproposed, in which `broadening' refers to broadening the search space with a\nspring block enabling search for numbers of channels during training of the\nsupernet; while `shrinking' refers to a novel shrinking strategy gradually\nturning off those underperforming operations. The above innovations broaden the\nsearch space for wider representation and then shrink it by gradually removing\nunderperforming operations, followed by an evolutionary algorithm to\nefficiently search for the optimal architecture. Extensive experiments on\nImageNet illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed BS-NAS as well as the\nstate-of-the-art performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Mar 2020 06:32:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-24"}

Recent studies have used liquid drops to probe the\nsurface mechanics of elastomeric networks. Experiments suggest an intricate\nsurface elasticity, also known as the Shuttleworth effect, where surface\ntension is not constant but depends on substrate deformation. However,\ninterpretations have remained controversial due to singular elastic\ndeformations, induced exactly at the point where the droplet pulls the network.\nHere we reveal the nature of the elastocapillary singularity on a hyperelastic\nsubstrate with various constitutive relations for the interfacial energy.\nFirst, we finely resolve the vicinity of the singularity using goal-adaptive\nfinite element simulations. This confirms the universal validity, also at large\nelastic deformations, of the previously disputed Neumann's law for the contact\nangles. Subsequently, we derive exact solutions of nonlinear elasticity that\ndescribe the singularity analytically. These solutions are in perfect agreement\nwith numerics, and show that the stretch at the contact line, as previously\nmeasured experimentally, consistently points to a strong Shuttleworth effect.\nFinally, using Noether's theorem we provide a quantitative link between wetting\nhysteresis and Eshelby-like forces, and thereby offer a complete framework for\nsoft wetting in the presence of the Shuttleworth effect.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Mar 2020 06:34:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-30"}

To verify the accuracy of the proposed algorithm,\nwe used experimental data of hybrid pattern battery cells mixed with dynamic\nand static patterns. In addition, we added a current measurement error that\noccurs when measuring at EV, and realized data that is closer to actual\nenvironment. This data was applied to two conventional estimation algorithms\n(Coulomb counting, Single EKF), two joint estimation algorithms (RLS & EKF,\nDFF-RLS & EKF) and ADFF-RLS & EKF. As a result, the proposed algorithm showed\nhigher SOC and SOH estimation accuracy in various driving patterns and actual\nEV driving environment than previous studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Mar 2020 08:40:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-24"}

However, a direct spectroscopy at modern x-ray sources such\nas synchrotrons or x-ray free electron lasers is challenging, because of the\nbroad spectral bandwidth of the delivered x-ray pulses, and because of a\nlimited spectral resolution offered by x-ray optics and detectors. To overcome\nthese challenges, here, we propose a spectroscopy technique based on a\nspectrally narrow reference absorber that is rapidly oscillating along the\npropagation direction of the x-ray light. The motion induces sidebands to the\nresponse of the absorber, which we scan across the spectrum of the unknown\ntarget to gain spectral information. The oscillation further introduces a\ndependence of the detected light on the motional phase at the time of x-ray\nexcitation as an additional controllable degree of freedom. We show how a\nFourier analysis with respect to this phase enables one to selectively extract\nparts of the recorded intensity after the actual experiment, throughout the\ndata analysis. This allows one to improve the spectral recovery by removing\nunwanted signal contributions. Our method is capable of gaining spectral\ninformation from the entire measured intensity, and not only from the intensity\nat late times after the excitation, such that a significantly higher part of\nthe signal photons can be used. Furthermore, it not only enables one to measure\nthe amplitude of the spectral response, but also its phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Mar 2020 09:49:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

Italy has now become the most hit country\noutside of Asia: on March 16, 2020, the Italian Civil Protection documented a\ntotal of 27980 confirmed cases and 2158 deaths of people tested positive for\nSARS-CoV-2.

This paper proposes a\nnew epidemic model that discriminates between infected individuals depending on\nwhether they have been diagnosed and on the severity of their symptoms. The\ndistinction between diagnosed and non-diagnosed is important because\nnon-diagnosed individuals are more likely to spread the infection than\ndiagnosed ones, since the latter are typically isolated, and can explain\nmisperceptions of the case fatality rate and of the seriousness of the epidemic\nphenomenon. Being able to predict the amount of patients that will develop\nlife-threatening symptoms is important since the disease frequently requires\nhospitalisation (and even Intensive Care Unit admission) and challenges the\nhealthcare system capacity. We show how the basic reproduction number can be\nredefined in the new framework, thus capturing the potential for epidemic\ncontainment.

Most existing methods solve this problem by simultaneously\nprojecting visual features and semantic supervision into a low-dimensional\ncommon space for efficient retrieval. However, such low-dimensional projection\ndestroys the completeness of semantic knowledge in original semantic space, so\nthat it is unable to transfer useful knowledge well when learning semantic from\ndifferent modalities. Moreover, the domain information and semantic information\nare entangled in visual features, which is not conducive for cross-modal\nmatching since it will hinder the reduction of domain gap between sketch and\nimage. In this paper, we propose a Progressive Domain-independent Feature\nDecomposition (PDFD) network for ZS-SBIR. Specifically, with the supervision of\noriginal semantic knowledge, PDFD decomposes visual features into domain\nfeatures and semantic ones, and then the semantic features are projected into\ncommon space as retrieval features for ZS-SBIR. The progressive projection\nstrategy maintains strong semantic supervision. Besides, to guarantee the\nretrieval features to capture clean and complete semantic information, the\ncross-reconstruction loss is introduced to encourage that any combinations of\nretrieval features and domain features can reconstruct the visual features.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our PDFD over\nstate-of-the-art competitors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Mar 2020 12:07:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 May 2022 12:07:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-09"}

To overcome\nthese disadvantages, we consider accelerating the learning process of DNNs on\nthe Mobile-Edge-Cloud Computing (MECC) paradigm. In this paper, we propose\nHierTrain, a hierarchical edge AI learning framework, which efficiently deploys\nthe DNN training task over the hierarchical MECC architecture. We develop a\nnovel \\textit{hybrid parallelism} method, which is the key to HierTrain, to\nadaptively assign the DNN model layers and the data samples across the three\nlevels of edge device, edge server and cloud center. We then formulate the\nproblem of scheduling the DNN training tasks at both layer-granularity and\nsample-granularity.

We show that\nthe local information cost ($\\textsf{LIC}$) presents a natural lower bound on\nthe communication complexity of distributed algorithms. For the synchronous\nCONGEST-KT1 model, where each node has initial knowledge of its neighbors' IDs,\nwe prove that $\\Omega(\\textsf{LIC}_\\gamma(P)/ \\log\\tau \\log n)$ bits are\nrequired for solving a graph problem $P$ with a $\\tau$-round algorithm that\nerrs with probability at most $\\gamma$. Our result is the first lower bound\nthat yields a general trade-off between communication and time for graph\nproblems in the CONGEST-KT1 model.\n  We demonstrate how to apply the local information cost by deriving a lower\nbound on the communication complexity of computing a $(2t-1)$-spanner that\nconsists of at most $O(n^{1+1/t + \\epsilon})$ edges, where $\\epsilon =\n\\Theta(1/t^2)$. Our main result is that any $O(\\textsf{poly}(n))$-time\nalgorithm must send at least $\\tilde\\Omega((1/t^2) n^{1+1/2t})$ bits in the\nCONGEST model under the KT1 assumption. Previously, only a trivial lower bound\nof $\\tilde \\Omega(n)$ bits was known for this problem.\n  A consequence of our lower bound is that achieving both time- and\ncommunication-optimality is impossible when designing a distributed spanner\nalgorithm. In light of the work of King, Kutten, and Thorup (PODC 2015), this\nshows that computing a minimum spanning tree can be done significantly faster\nthan finding a spanner when considering algorithms with $\\tilde O(n)$\ncommunication complexity.

Supernovae (SNe) are supposed to play a key role in forming\nlarge-scale galactic winds by removing important amounts of gas from galaxies.\nSNe are efficient accelerators of non-thermal particles, so-called cosmic rays\n(CRs), which can substantially modify the dynamics of the gas and conditions to\nform large-scale galactic winds. We investigate how CR injection by SNe impacts\nthe star formation and the formation of large-scale winds in dwarf galaxies,\nand whether it can produce galaxy star-formation rates (SFR) and wind\nproperties closer to observations. We ran CR magneto-hydrodynamical simulations\nof dwarf galaxies at high resolution (9 pc) with the adaptive mesh refinement\ncode ramses. Disc galaxies are embedded in isolated halos of mass of $10^{10}$\nand $10^{11} \\, \\rm M_{\\odot}$, and CRs are injected by SNe. We included CR\nisotropic and anisotropic diffusion with various diffusion coefficients, CR\nradiative losses, and CR streaming. The injection of CR energy into the\ninterstellar medium smooths out the highest gas densities, which reduces the\nSFR by a factor of 2-3. Mass outflow rates are significantly greater with CR\ndiffusion, by 2 orders of magnitudes for the higher diffusion coefficients.\nWithout diffusion and streaming, CRs are inefficient at generating winds. CR\nstreaming alone allows for the formation of winds but which are too weak to\nmatch observations. The formation of galactic winds strongly depends on the\ndiffusion coefficient: for low coefficients, CR energy stays confined in high\ndensity regions where CR energy losses are highest, and higher coefficients,\nwhich allow for a more efficient leaking of CRs out of dense gas, produce\nstronger winds. CR diffusion leads to colder and denser winds than without CRs,\nand brings outflow rates and mass loading factors much closer to observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Mar 2020 14:04:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Apr 2020 12:25:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

Most methods essentially\ncompute warps from the product image to the model image and combine using image\ngeneration methods. However, obtaining a realistic image is challenging because\nthe kinematics of garments is complex and because outline, texture, and shading\ncues in the image reveal errors to human viewers. The garment must have\nappropriate drapes; texture must be warped to be consistent with the shape of a\ndraped garment; small details (buttons, collars, lapels, pockets, etc.) must be\nplaced appropriately on the garment, and so on. Evaluation is particularly\ndifficult and is usually qualitative.\n  This paper uses quantitative evaluation on a challenging, novel dataset to\ndemonstrate that (a) for any warping method, one can choose target models\nautomatically to improve results, and (b) learning multiple coordinated\nspecialized warpers offers further improvements on results. Target models are\nchosen by a learned embedding procedure that predicts a representation of the\nproducts the model is wearing. This prediction is used to match products to\nmodels. Specialized warpers are trained by a method that encourages a second\nwarper to perform well in locations where the first works poorly. The warps are\nthen combined using a U-Net.

The idea of establishing payment\nchannel networks is one of the many proposed solutions to address this\nscalability issue where nodes, by utilizing smart contracting, establish\npayment channels between each other and perform off-chain transactions.\nHowever, due to the way these channels are created, both sides have a certain\none-way capacity for making transactions. Consequently, if one sides exceeds\nthis one-way capacity, the channel becomes useless in that particular\ndirection, which causes failures of payments and eventually creates an\nimbalance in the overall network. To keep the payment channel network\nsustainable, in this paper, we aim to increase the overall success rate of\npayments by effectively exploiting the fact that end-users are usually\nconnected to the network at multiple points (i.e., gateways) any of which can\nbe used to initiate the payment. We propose an efficient method for selection\nof the gateway for a user by considering the gateway's inbound and outbound\npayment traffic ratio. We then augment this proposed method with split payment\ncapability to further increase success rate especially for large transactions.\nThe evaluation of the proposed method shows that compared to greedy and\nmaxflow-based approaches, we can achieve much higher success rates, which are\nfurther improved with split payments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Mar 2020 18:17:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-15"}

Symbolic tools like OYENTE and\nMAIAN are typically used for vulnerability prediction in smart contracts. As\nthese tools are computationally expensive, they are typically used to detect\nvulnerabilities until some predefined invocation depth. These tools require\nmore search time as the invocation depth increases. Since the number of smart\ncontracts is increasing exponentially, it is difficult to analyze the contracts\nusing these traditional tools. Recently a machine learning technique called\nLong Short Term Memory (LSTM) has been used for binary classification, i.e., to\npredict whether a smart contract is vulnerable or not. This technique requires\nnearly constant search time as the invocation depth increases. In the present\narticle, we have shown a multi-class classification, where we classify a smart\ncontract in Suicidal, Prodigal, Greedy, or Normal categories. We used Average\nStochastic Gradient Descent Weight-Dropped LSTM (AWD-LSTM), which is a variant\nof LSTM, to perform classification. We reduced the class imbalance (a large\nnumber of normal contracts as compared to other categories) by considering only\nthe distinct opcode combination for normal contracts. We have achieved a\nweighted average Fbeta score of 90.0%. Hence, such techniques can be used to\nanalyze a large number of smart contracts and help to improve the security of\nthese contracts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Mar 2020 20:48:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-02"}

This paper performs a systematic review of how computer vision,\nmachine learning models perform an abnormal patient's gait assessment. Computer\nvision is beneficial in gait analysis, it helps capture the patient posture.\nSeveral literature suggests the use of different machine learning algorithms\nsuch as SVM, ANN, K-Star, Random Forest, KNN, among others to perform the\nclassification on the features extracted to study patient gait abnormalities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Mar 2020 02:00:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-07"}

We also investigate the effect of latency constraints, and\nuncover interesting characteristics of the predictor over different Signal to\nNoise Ratio (SNR) ranges.

A broad range of theoretical tools exist\nto extract material parameters and interpret them thanks to data analysis\nand/or physical modelling. RHEOS (RHEology, Open-Source) is a software package\ndesigned to make the analysis of rheological data simpler, faster and more\nreproducible. RHEOS is currently limited to the broad family of linear\nviscoelastic models. A particular strength of the library is its ability to\nhandle rheological models containing fractional derivatives which have\ndemonstrable utility for the modelling of biological materials but have\nhitherto remained in relative obscurity-possibly due to their mathematical and\ncomputational complexity. RHEOS is written in Julia, which greatly assists\nachievement of our aims as it provides excellent computational efficiency and\napproachable syntax. RHEOS is fully documented and has extensive testing\ncoverage. It should be noted that RHEOS is not an optimisation package. It\nbuilds on another optimisation package, NLopt, by adding a large number of\nabstractions and functionality specific to the exploration of viscoelastic\ndata.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Mar 2020 21:33:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-17"}
