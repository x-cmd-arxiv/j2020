Most of the existing image retrieval methods only focus\non single-domain retrieval, which assumes that the distributions of retrieval\ndatabases and queries are similar. However, in practical application, the\ndiscrepancies between retrieval databases often taken in ideal\nillumination/pose/background/camera conditions and queries usually obtained in\nuncontrolled conditions are very large. In this paper, considering the\npractical application, we focus on challenging cross-domain retrieval. To\naddress the problem, we propose an effective method named Probability Weighted\nCompact Feature Learning (PWCF), which provides inter-domain correlation\nguidance to promote cross-domain retrieval accuracy and learns a series of\ncompact binary codes to improve the retrieval speed. First, we derive our loss\nfunction through the Maximum A Posteriori Estimation (MAP): Bayesian\nPerspective (BP) induced focal-triplet loss, BP induced quantization loss and\nBP induced classification loss. Second, we propose a common manifold structure\nbetween domains to explore the potential correlation across domains.\nConsidering the original feature representation is biased due to the\ninter-domain discrepancy, the manifold structure is difficult to be\nconstructed. Therefore, we propose a new feature named Histogram Feature of\nNeighbors (HFON) from the sample statistics perspective. Extensive experiments\non various benchmark databases validate that our method outperforms many\nstate-of-the-art image retrieval methods for domain adaptive image retrieval.\nThe source code is available at https://github.com/fuxianghuang1/PWCF\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Mar 2020 16:11:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-09"}

We manually analyze each bug and extract\ntheir culprit patterns. Our analysis result shows that Rust can keep its\npromise that all memory-safety bugs require unsafe code, and many memory-safety\nbugs in our dataset are mild soundness issues that only leave a possibility to\nwrite memory-safety bugs without unsafe code. Furthermore, we summarize three\ntypical categories of memory-safety bugs, including automatic memory reclaim,\nunsound function, and unsound generic or trait. While automatic memory claim\nbugs are related to the side effect of Rust newly-adopted ownership-based\nresource management scheme, unsound function reveals the essential challenge of\nRust development for avoiding unsound code, and unsound generic or trait\nintensifies the risk of introducing unsoundness. Based on these findings, we\npropose two promising directions towards improving the security of Rust\ndevelopment, including several best practices of using specific APIs and\nmethods to detect particular bugs involving unsafe code.

Many physically relevant models in one dimension are Bethe-ansatz\nintegrable, including the anisotropic spin-1/2 Heisenberg (also called spin-1/2\nXXZ chain) and the Fermi-Hubbard model. Nevertheless, practical computations\nof, for instance, correlation functions and transport coefficients pose hard\nproblems from both the conceptual and technical point of view.

Most importantly, due to the discovery of a novel class of\nquasilocal conserved quantities, there is now a qualitative understanding of\nthe origin of ballistic finite-temperature transport, and even diffusive or\nsuper-diffusive subleading corrections, in integrable lattice models. We shall\nreview the current understanding of transport in one-dimensional lattice\nmodels, in particular, in the paradigmatic example of the spin-1/2 XXZ and\nFermi-Hubbard models, and we elaborate on state-of-the-art theoretical methods,\nincluding both analytical and computational approaches.

As the number of classes increases\nrapidly with the number of elements, it is desirable to have coarser\nequivalence class decompositions based on certain invariants of finite metric\nspaces. If $(X,d)$ is a finite metric space with elements $P_i$ and with\ndistance functions $d_{ij}$, the Gromov product at $P_i$ is defined as\n$\\Delta_{ijk}=1/2(d_{ij}+d_{ik}-d_{jk})$.

Although strong feedback can\npromote the formation of galactic discs by limiting star formation at early\ntimes and removing low angular momentum gas, it is not understood how the same\nfeedback can result in diverse objects such as elliptical galaxies or razor\nthin spiral galaxies. We investigate this problem using cosmological zoom-in\nsimulations of two galaxies forming within $10^{12}~\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$ halos\nwith almost identical mass accretion histories and halo spin parameters.\nHowever, the two resulting galaxies end up with very different bulge-to-disc\nratios at $z = 0$.

After the last starburst episode, both\ngalaxies feature a dramatic gaseous disc growth from 1~kpc to 5~kpc during\n1~Gyr, a decisive event we dub \"the Grand Twirl\". After this event, the\nevolutionary tracks diverge strongly, with one galaxy ending up as a\nbulge-dominated galaxy, whereas the other ends up as a disc-dominated galaxy.\nThe origins of this dichotomy are the angular momentum of the accreted gas, and\nwhether it adds constructively to the initial disc angular momentum.

We reproduce\nquantitatively the strongest peak-trough asymmetries, near the 3:2 and 2:1\nresonances, using dissipative interactions between planets and their natal\ndiscs. Disc eccentricity damping captures bodies into resonance and clears the\ntrough, and when combined with disc-driven convergent migration, draws planets\ninitially wide of commensurability into the peak.

Credit networks are peer-to-peer trust-based\nnetworks that enable fast and inexpensive cross-currency transactions compared\nto traditional bank wire transfers, which has led to their increasing\npopularity and use. Although researchers have studied security of transactions\nand privacy of users of such networks, and have invested significant efforts\ninto designing efficient routing algorithms for credit networks, comparatively\nlittle work has been done in the area of {replenishing} credit links of users\nin the network. Replenishing links at regular intervals in a credit network is\nimportant to keep users solvent, the network viable with enough liquidity, and\nto prevent transaction failures. This is achieved by a process called\n{rebalancing} that enables a poorly funded user to create incoming as well as\noutgoing credit links. We propose a system where a user with zero or no link\nweights can create incoming links with existing, trusted users in the network,\nin a procedure we call {balance transfer}, followed by creating outgoing links\nto existing or new users that would like to join the network, a process we call\n{bailout}.

Despite an active research, it still remains\nunclear whether the rippled phase exists in the thermodynamic limit, or it is\ndestroyed by thermal fluctuations. We demonstrate that a sufficiently strong\nshort-range disorder stabilizes ripples, whereas in the case of a weak disorder\nthe thermal flexural fluctuations dominate in the thermodynamic limit. The\nphase diagram of the disordered suspended graphene contains two separatrices:\nthe crumpling transition line dividing the flat and crumpled phases and the\nrippling transition line demarking the rippled and clean phases. At the\nintersection of the separatrices there is the unstable, multicritical point\nwhich splits up all four phases. Most remarkably, rippled and clean flat phases\nare described by a single stable fixed point which belongs to the rippling\ntransition line. Coexistence of two flat phases in the single point is possible\ndue to non-analiticity in corresponding renormalization group equations and\nreflects non-commutativity of limits of vanishing thermal and rippling\nfluctuations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Mar 2020 20:20:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-27"}

High-efficiency\ninductive output tubes (IOTs) are typically characterized by efficiencies up to\n70 - 75%. However, the achievement of efficiencies greater than 80% would\nsubstantially reduce the operating costs of next-generation accelerators. In\norder to achieve this goal, we consider the addition of a 3rd harmonic\ncomponent to the drive signal on the grid of an inductive output tube. The use\nof a 3rd harmonic drive component in IOT guns has been considered in order to\napply such a gun as the injector [1] of radio frequency linear accelerators (RF\nlinacs). Here we consider that the IOT will be used to provide the rf power to\ndrive RF linacs and apply the 3rd harmonic with the intention of increasing the\nefficiency of the RF output of the IOT.

Examples include npm (JavaScript), and PyPI (Python).\nThese tools encourage code reuse, making it trivial for developers to import\nexternal packages. Unfortunately, repositories' size and the ease with which\npackages can be published facilitates the practice of typosquatting: the\nuploading of a package with name similar to that of a highly popular package,\ntypically with the aim of capturing some of the popular package's installs.\nTyposquatting has serious negative implications, resulting in developers\nimporting malicious packages, or -- as we show -- code clones which do not\nincorporate recent security updates. In order to tackle this problem, we\npresent SpellBound, a tool for identifying and reporting potentially erroneous\nimports to developers. SpellBound implements a novel typosquatting detection\ntechnique, based on an in-depth analysis of npm and PyPI. Our technique\nleverages a model of lexical similarity between names, and further incorporates\nthe notion of package popularity. This approach flags cases where\nunknown/scarcely used packages would be installed in place of popular ones with\nsimilar names, before installation occurs. We evaluated SpellBound on both npm\nand PyPI, with encouraging results: SpellBound flags typosquatting cases while\ngenerating limited warnings (0.5% of total package installs), and low overhead\n(only 2.5% of package install time). Furthermore, SpellBound allowed us to\nconfirm known cases of typosquatting and discover one high-profile, unknown\ncase of typosquatting that resulted in a package takedown by the npm security\nteam.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Mar 2020 23:59:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-10"}

This baseline network strikes a good trade-off between\naccuracy and efficiency, achieving superior performance than most of existing\nbinary networks at approximately half of the computational cost. Through\nextensive experiments and analysis, we observed that the performance of binary\nnetworks is sensitive to activation distribution variations. Based on this\nimportant observation, we propose to generalize the traditional Sign and PReLU\nfunctions, denoted as RSign and RPReLU for the respective generalized\nfunctions, to enable explicit learning of the distribution reshape and shift at\nnear-zero extra cost.

Although there is ample literature on\nthe optimum placement of BSs for sub-6 GHz bands, channel propagation\ncharacteristics, such as penetration loss, are notably different in\nmillimeter-wave (mmWave) bands than in sub-6 GHz bands. Therefore, designated\nsolutions are needed for mmWave systems to have reliable quality of service\n(QoS) assessment. This article proposes a multi-armed bandit (MAB) learning\napproach for the mmWave BS placement problem. The proposed solution performs\nviewshed analysis to identify the areas that are visible to a given BS location\nby considering the 3D geometry of the outdoor environments. Coverage\nprobability, which is used as the QoS metric, is calculated using the\nappropriate path loss model depending on the viewshed analysis and a\nprobabilistic blockage model and then fed to the MAB learning mechanism. The\noptimum BS location is then determined based on the expected reward that the\ncandidate locations attain at the end of the training process. Unlike the\noptimization-based techniques, this method can capture the time-varying\nbehavior of the channel and find the optimal BS locations that maximize\nlong-term performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Mar 2020 02:31:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-10"}

However, there are still two shortcomings in the existing\nresearch: 1) In most cases, emotion expression and cause are not the whole\nclause, but the span in the clause, so extracting the clause-pair rather than\nthe span-pair greatly limits its applications in real-world scenarios; 2) It is\nnot enough to extract the emotion expression clause without identifying the\nemotion categories, the presence of emotion clause does not necessarily convey\nemotional information explicitly due to different possible causes. In this\npaper, we propose a new task: Emotion-Cause Span-Pair extraction and\nclassification (ECSP), which aims to extract the potential span-pair of emotion\nand corresponding causes in a document, and make emotion classification for\neach pair. In the new ECSP task, ECE and ECPE can be regarded as two special\ncases at the clause-level. We propose a span-based extract-then-classify (ETC)\nmodel, where emotion and cause are directly extracted and paired from the\ndocument under the supervision of target span boundaries, and corresponding\ncategories are then classified using their pair representations and localized\ncontext.

Approximate inference provides powerful tools to Bayesian reasoning,\ndecision making, and Bayesian deep learning. The main goal is to estimate the\nexpectation of interested functions w.r.t. a target distribution. When it comes\nto high dimensional probability models and large datasets, efficient\napproximate inference becomes critically important. In this thesis, we propose\na new framework for approximate inference, which combines the advantages of\nthese three frameworks and overcomes their limitations. Our proposed four\nalgorithms are motivated by the recent computational progress of Stein's\nmethod. Our proposed algorithms are applied to continuous and discrete\ndistributions under the setting when the gradient information of the target\ndistribution is available or unavailable. Theoretical analysis is provided to\nprove the convergence of our proposed algorithms. Our adaptive IS algorithm\niteratively improves the importance proposal by functionally decreasing the KL\ndivergence between the updated proposal and the target. When the gradient of\nthe target is unavailable, our proposed sampling algorithm leverages the\ngradient of a surrogate model and corrects induced bias with importance\nweights, which significantly outperforms other gradient-free sampling\nalgorithms. In addition, our theoretical results enable us to perform the\ngoodness-of-fit test on discrete distributions. At the end of the thesis, we\npropose an importance-weighted method to efficiently aggregate local models in\ndistributed learning with one-shot communication. Results on simulated and real\ndatasets indicate the statistical efficiency and wide applicability of our\nalgorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Mar 2020 04:33:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-10"}

To address this problem, this paper\nproposes a simple yet efficient Temporal Transformer with Progressive\nPrediction (TTPP) framework, which repurposes a Transformer-style architecture\nto aggregate observed features, and then leverages a light-weight network to\nprogressively predict future features and actions.

To overcome this\nlimitation, several states have turned towards algorithmic decision-making\nsystems to reduce costs and determine better processes for improving CWS\noutcomes. Using a human-centered algorithmic design approach, we synthesize 50\npeer-reviewed publications on computational systems used in CWS to assess how\nthey were being developed, common characteristics of predictors used, as well\nas the target outcomes. We found that most of the literature has focused on\nrisk assessment models but does not consider theoretical approaches (e.g.,\nchild-foster parent matching) nor the perspectives of caseworkers (e.g., case\nnotes). Therefore, future algorithms should strive to be context-aware and\ntheoretically robust by incorporating salient factors identified by past\nresearch. We provide the HCI community with research avenues for developing\nhuman-centered algorithms that redirect attention towards more equitable\noutcomes for CWS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Mar 2020 09:16:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-10"}

In this paper, we\npropose a novel Hierarchical Scale Recalibration Network (HSRNet), which\naddresses the above issues by modeling rich contextual dependencies and\nrecalibrating multiple scale-associated information. Specifically, a Scale\nFocus Module (SFM) first integrates global context into local features by\nmodeling the semantic inter-dependencies along channel and spatial dimensions\nsequentially. In order to reallocate channel-wise feature responses, a Scale\nRecalibration Module (SRM) adopts a step-by-step fusion to generate final\ndensity maps. Furthermore, we propose a novel Scale Consistency loss to\nconstrain that the scale-associated outputs are coherent with groundtruth of\ndifferent scales. With the proposed modules, our approach can ignore various\nnoises selectively and focus on appropriate crowd scales automatically.\nExtensive experiments on crowd counting datasets (ShanghaiTech, MALL,\nWorldEXPO'10, and UCSD) show that our HSRNet can deliver superior results over\nall state-of-the-art approaches.

It is assumed that only a small number of agents can have access to\nthe system matrix and states of the leader.

Federated learning provides a potential solution to\nprivacy-preserving and secure machine learning, by means of jointly training a\nglobal model without uploading data distributed on multiple devices to a\ncentral server. However, most existing work on federated learning adopts\nmachine learning models with full-precision weights, and almost all these\nmodels contain a large number of redundant parameters that do not need to be\ntransmitted to the server, consuming an excessive amount of communication\ncosts.

Our\nenvironment is based on connecting the CARLA simulation software to TensorFlow\nmachine learning framework and custom AI client software. The AI client\nsoftware receives data from a simulated world via virtual sensors and\ntransforms the data into information using machine learning models. The AI\nclients control vehicles in the simulated world. Our environment monitors the\nstate assumed by the vehicle AIs to the ground truth state derived from the\nsimulation model. Our system can search for corner cases where the vehicle AI\nis unable to correctly understand the situation. In our paper, we present the\noverall hybrid simulator architecture and compare different configurations. We\npresent performance measurements from real setups, and outline the main\nparameters affecting the hybrid simulator performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Mar 2020 13:05:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-10"}

The magnetic field selects its subset, which can be mapped to a trimer\ncovering of the dual lattice, and forms a magnetization plateau of $M=1/9$. In\naddition to this CSL, we find two other magnetization plateaus at $M=5/9$ and\n$17/27$, which are ascribed to the \"multimer\" superstructures on a dual\nlattice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Mar 2020 15:58:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Mar 2020 08:18:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 11 Mar 2020 13:00:25 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 9 Apr 2020 15:09:39 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 26 Apr 2020 07:12:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-28"}

In a frequency division duplex (FDD)\nmultiuser massive MIMO network, each user needs to compress and feedback its\ndownlink CSI to the BS. The CSI overhead scales with the number of antennas,\nusers and subcarriers, and becomes a major bottleneck for the overall spectral\nefficiency. In this paper, we propose a deep learning (DL)-based CSI\ncompression scheme, called DeepCMC, composed of convolutional layers followed\nby quantization and entropy coding blocks. In comparison with previous DL-based\nCSI reduction structures, DeepCMC proposes a novel fully-convolutional neural\nnetwork (NN) architecture, with residual layers at the decoder, and\nincorporates quantization and entropy coding blocks into its design. DeepCMC is\ntrained to minimize a weighted rate-distortion cost, which enables a trade-off\nbetween the CSI quality and its feedback overhead. Simulation results\ndemonstrate that DeepCMC outperforms the state of the art CSI compression\nschemes in terms of the reconstruction quality of CSI for the same compression\nrate. We also propose a distributed version of DeepCMC for a multi-user MIMO\nscenario to encode and reconstruct the CSI from multiple users in a distributed\nmanner. Distributed DeepCMC not only utilizes the inherent CSI structures of a\nsingle MIMO user for compression, but also benefits from the correlations among\nthe channel matrices of nearby users to further improve the performance in\ncomparison with DeepCMC.

Our decentralized approach enables\nlearning of a transferable-adaptive-traffic-signal-control policy.

Furthermore, our approach can exploit the\ngranularity of available data by capturing the (dynamic) demand at both the\nlane and the vehicle levels.

Though experiments and simulations have measured\nthe bubble/dew points and sorption isotherms of hydrocarbons confined in both\nnatural and synthetic nanopores, the confinement effects in terms of the\nstrength of fluid-pore interactions tuned by surface wettability and chemistry\nhave received comparably less discussion. More importantly, the underlying\nphysics of confinement-induced phenomena remain obfuscated. In this work, we\nstudied the phase behavior and capillary condensation of n-hexane to understand\nthe effects of confinement at the molecular level. To systematically\ninvestigate the pore effects, we constructed two types of wall confinements;\none is a structureless virtual wall described by the Steele potential and the\nother one is an all-atom amorphous silica structure with surface modified by\nhydroxyl groups. Our numerical results demonstrated the importance of\nfluid-pore interaction, pore size, and pore morphology effects in mediating the\npressure-volume-temperature (PVT) properties of hydrocarbons. The most\nremarkable finding of this work was that the saturation pressure predicted from\nthe van der Waals-type adsorption isothermal loop could be elevated or\nsuppressed relative to the bulk phase, as illustrated in the graphical\nabstract. As the surface energy (i.e., fluid-pore interaction) decreased, the\nisothermal vapor pressure increased, indicating a greater preference for the\nfluid to exist in the vapor state. Sufficient reduction of the fluid-pore\ninteractions could even elevate the vapor pressure above that of the bulk\nfluid.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Mar 2020 22:08:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-16"}

Previous works either concatenate the multiple modality features,\nthat is equivalent to giving a fixed importance weight to each modality; or\nlearn dynamic weights of different modalities for different items through\ntechnique like attention mechanism. However, a problem is that there usually\nexists common redundant information across multiple modalities. The dynamic\nweights of different modalities computed by using the redundant information may\nnot correctly reflect the different importance of each modality. To address\nthis, we explore the complementarity and redundancy of modalities by\nconsidering modality-specific and modality-invariant features differently. We\npropose a novel Multimodal Adversarial Representation Network (MARN) for the\nCTR prediction task. A multimodal attention network first calculates the\nweights of multiple modalities for each item according to its modality-specific\nfeatures. Then a multimodal adversarial network learns modality-invariant\nrepresentations where a double-discriminators strategy is introduced. Finally,\nwe achieve the multimodal item representations by combining both\nmodality-specific and modality-invariant representations.
