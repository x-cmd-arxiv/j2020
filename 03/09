In\nprevious approaches, which have generally been supervised, the training\nobjective typically measures a pixel-wise average distance between the\nsuper-resolved (SR) and HR images. Optimizing such metrics often leads to\nblurring, especially in high variance (detailed) regions. We propose an\nalternative formulation of the super-resolution problem based on creating\nrealistic SR images that downscale correctly. We present an algorithm\naddressing this problem, PULSE (Photo Upsampling via Latent Space Exploration),\nwhich generates high-resolution, realistic images at resolutions previously\nunseen in the literature. It accomplishes this in an entirely self-supervised\nfashion and is not confined to a specific degradation operator used during\ntraining, unlike previous methods (which require supervised training on\ndatabases of LR-HR image pairs). Instead of starting with the LR image and\nslowly adding detail, PULSE traverses the high-resolution natural image\nmanifold, searching for images that downscale to the original LR image. This is\nformalized through the \"downscaling loss,\" which guides exploration through the\nlatent space of a generative model. By leveraging properties of\nhigh-dimensional Gaussians, we restrict the search space to guarantee realistic\noutputs. PULSE thereby generates super-resolved images that both are realistic\nand downscale correctly. We show proof of concept of our approach in the domain\nof face super-resolution (i.e., face hallucination). We also present a\ndiscussion of the limitations and biases of the method as currently implemented\nwith an accompanying model card with relevant metrics.

The boundary condition $\\partial_x h(x,t)|_{x=0}=A$\ncorresponds to an attractive wall for $A<0$, and leads to the binding of the\npolymer to the wall below the critical value $A=-1/2$.

Many studies\nhave used CNNs to detect nodule candidates. Though such approaches have been\nshown to outperform the conventional image processing based methods regarding\nthe detection accuracy, CNNs are also known to be limited to generalize on\nunder-represented samples in the training set and prone to imperceptible noise\nperturbations. Such limitations can not be easily addressed by scaling up the\ndataset or the models. In this work, we propose to add adversarial synthetic\nnodules and adversarial attack samples to the training data to improve the\ngeneralization and the robustness of the lung nodule detection systems. To\ngenerate hard examples of nodules from a differentiable nodule synthesizer, we\nuse projected gradient descent (PGD) to search the latent code within a bounded\nneighbourhood that would generate nodules to decrease the detector response. To\nmake the network more robust to unanticipated noise perturbations, we use PGD\nto search for noise patterns that can trigger the network to give\nover-confident mistakes. By evaluating on two different benchmark datasets\ncontaining consensus annotations from three radiologists, we show that the\nproposed techniques can improve the detection performance on real CT data. To\nunderstand the limitations of both the conventional networks and the proposed\naugmented networks, we also perform stress-tests on the false positive\nreduction networks by feeding different types of artificially produced patches.\nWe show that the augmented networks are more robust to both under-represented\nnodules as well as resistant to noise perturbations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Mar 2020 18:32:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Oct 2020 23:55:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-30"}

To meet such a demand, there is a need for a highly-skilled software\ntesting work-force (test engineers) in the industry. To address that need, many\nuniversity educators worldwide have included software-testing education in\ntheir software engineering (SE) or computer science (CS) programs. Objective:\nOur objective in this paper is to summarize the body of experience and\nknowledge in the area of software-testing education to benefit the readers\n(both educators and researchers) in designing and delivering software testing\ncourses in university settings, and to also conduct further education research\nin this area. Method: To address the above need, we conducted a systematic\nliterature mapping (SLM) to synthesize what the community of educators have\npublished on this topic. After compiling a candidate pool of 307 papers, and\napplying a set of inclusion/exclusion criteria, our final pool included 204\npapers published between 1992 and 2019.

Features such as provenance tracking, archiving, and\ndata citation are widely regarded as important features for curated databases,\nbut implementing such features is challenging, and small database projects\noften lack the resources to do so. A scientific database application is not\njust the database itself, but also an ecosystem of web applications to display\nthe data, and applications supporting data curation. Supporting advanced\ncuration features requires changing all of these components, and there is\ncurrently no way to provide such capabilities in a reusable way. Cross-tier\nprogramming languages have been proposed to simplify the creation of web\napplications, where developers write an application in a single, uniform\nlanguage. Consequently, database queries and updates can be written in the same\nlanguage as the rest of the program, and at least in principle, it should be\npossible to provide curation features reusably via program transformations. As\na first step, it is important to establish that realistic curated databases can\nbe implemented in a cross-tier programming language.

Thus, detection and mitigation\nof side channel attacks is a very important problem, but the solutions proposed\nin the literature have limitations in that they do not work in a real-world\nmulti-tenancy setting on servers, have high false positives, or have high\noverheads. In this work, we demonstrate a compiler guided scheduler, Biscuit,\nthat detects cache-based side channel attacks for processes scheduled on\nmulti-tenancy server farms. A key element of this solution involves the use of\na cache-miss model which is inserted by the compiler at the entrances of loop\nnests to predict the cache misses of the corresponding loop. Such inserted\nlibrary calls, or beacons, convey the cache miss information to the scheduler\nat run time, which uses it to co-schedule processes such that their combined\ncache footprint does not exceed the maximum capacity of the last level cache.\nThe scheduled processes are then monitored for actual vs predicted cache\nmisses, and when an anomaly is detected, the scheduler performs a search to\nisolate the attacker.

Thus, measurement based\ncharacterization of IBR is a popular approach to find frequency-domain response\nof an IBR.

As\ndecision making is a process which happens over time, it can be well modeled by\ndynamical systems. Often, decisions are made on the basis of perceived values\nof the underlying options and the desired outcome is to select the option with\nthe highest value. This can be encoded as a bifurcation which produces a stable\nequilibrium corresponding to the high-value option. When some options have\nidentical values, it is natural to design the decision-making model to be\nindifferent among the equally-valued options, leading to symmetries in the\nunderlying dynamical system. For example, when all $N$ options have identical\nvalues, the dynamical system should have $S_N$ symmetry. Unfortunately,\nconstructing a dynamical system that unfolds the $S_N$-symmetric pitchfork\nbifurcation is non-trivial. In this paper, we develop a method to construct an\nunfolding of the pitchfork bifurcation with a symmetry group that is a\nsignificant subgroup of $S_N$. The construction begins by parsing the decision\namong $N$ options into a hierarchical set of $N-1$ binary decisions encoded in\na binary tree. By associating the unfolding of a standard $S_2$-symmetric\npitchfork bifurcation with each of these binary decisions, we develop an\nunfolding of the pitchfork bifurcation with symmetries corresponding to\nisomorphisms of the underlying binary tree.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Mar 2020 00:15:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-10"}

The\nplasma is described by the equations of fully general relativistic\nmagnetohydrodynamics (MHD) along with the Ohm's law and in the absence of the\neffects of radiation fields. We try to solve these two-dimensional MHD\nequations analytically as much as possible. However, we sometimes inevitably\nrefer to numerical methods as well. To fully understand the relativistic\ngeometrically thick accretion disc structure, we consider all three components\nof the fluid velocity to be non-zero. This implies that the magnetofluid can\nflow in all three directions surrounding the central black hole. As we get\nradially closer to the hole, the fluid flows faster in all those directions.\nHowever, as we move towards the equator along the meridional direction, the\nradial inflow becomes stronger from both the speed and the mass accretion rate\npoints of view. Nonetheless, the vertical (meridional) speed and the rotation\nof the plasma disc become slower in that direction. Due to the presence of\npressure gradient forces, a sub-Keplerian angular momentum distribution\nthroughout the thick disc is expected as well. To get a concise analytical form\nof the rate of accretion, we assume that the radial dependency of radial and\nmeridional fluid velocities is the same. This simplifying assumption leads to\nradial independency of mass accretion rate. The motion of the accreting plasma\nproduces an azimuthal current whose strength is specified based on the strength\nof the external dipolar magnetic field. This current generates a poloidal\nmagnetic field in the disc which is continuous across the disc boundary surface\ndue to the presence of the finite resistivity for the plasma.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Mar 2020 02:44:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-18"}

One challenge of semantic segmentation is\nto deal with the object scale variations and leverage the context. How to\nperform multi-scale context aggregation within limited computation budget is\nimportant. In this paper, firstly, we introduce a novel and efficient module\ncalled Cascaded Factorized Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (CF-ASPP). It is a\nlightweight cascaded structure for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to\nefficiently leverage context information. On the other hand, for runtime\nefficiency, state-of-the-art methods will quickly decrease the spatial size of\nthe inputs or feature maps in the early network stages. The final\nhigh-resolution result is usually obtained by non-parametric up-sampling\noperation (e.g. bilinear interpolation). Differently, we rethink this pipeline\nand treat it as a super-resolution process. We use optimized super-resolution\noperation in the up-sampling step and improve the accuracy, especially in\nsub-sampled input image scenario for real-time applications. By fusing the\nabove two improvements, our methods provide better latency-accuracy trade-off\nthan the other state-of-the-art methods. In particular, we achieve 68.4% mIoU\nat 84 fps on the Cityscapes test set with a single Nivida Titan X (Maxwell) GPU\ncard.

DIC is based on causal inference,\nwhose two principles: the backdoor and front-door adjustments, help us to\nreview previous works and design the effective models.

Last but not\nleast, DICv1.0 is merely a natural derivation from our causal retrospect, which\nopens a promising direction for image captioning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Mar 2020 04:59:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-10"}

However, the basic concepts in all dielectric photonics such as\nanapole resonances in nanodisks have been primarily studied in high index\nmaterials such as WS2 and Si. Without additional measures, low index dielectric\nnanodisks struggle to achieve similar levels of light confinement. Here, we\npresent fabricable design space for higher confinement in a low index\ndielectric cavity by incorporating the extensively studied, isolated dielectric\nnanodisk into broader host structures. In particular, we focus on hexagonal\nboron nitride (hBN), a novel dielectric 2D material with bright, room\ntemperature single photon emitters and refractive indices of 2.1 and 1.8 in the\ninplane and out-of-plane directions. Due to hBN's potential as a quantum light\nsource, we characterise our cavities by their achievable Purcell factors at the\nanapole resonance.

Conventional network binarization methods\ndirectly quantize the weights and activations in one-stage or two-stage\ndetectors with constrained representational capacity, so that the information\nredundancy in the networks causes numerous false positives and degrades the\nperformance significantly. On the contrary, our BiDet fully utilizes the\nrepresentational capacity of the binary neural networks for object detection by\nredundancy removal, through which the detection precision is enhanced with\nalleviated false positives. Specifically, we generalize the information\nbottleneck (IB) principle to object detection, where the amount of information\nin the high-level feature maps is constrained and the mutual information\nbetween the feature maps and object detection is maximized. Meanwhile, we learn\nsparse object priors so that the posteriors are concentrated on informative\ndetection prediction with false positive elimination.

In such cases, the monotonicity\nassumptions that are frequently made in the theory of mean field games do not\nhold, and uniqueness cannot be expected in general. Such model lead to systems\nof forward-backward nonlinear nonlocal parabolic equations; the latter are\nsupplemented with various kinds of boundary conditions, in particular\nNeumann-like boundary conditions stemming from reflection conditions on the\nunderlying controled stochastic processes. The present work deals with\nnumerical approximations of the above mentioned systems. After describing the\nfinite difference scheme, we propose an iterative method for solving the\nsystems of nonlinear equations that arise in the discrete setting; it combines\na continuation method, Newton iterations and inner loops of a bigradient like\nsolver. The numerical method is used for simulating two examples. We also make\nexperiments on the behaviour of the iterative algorithm when the parameters of\nthe model vary. The theory of mean field games, (MFGs for short), aims at\nstudying deterministic or stochastic differential games (Nash equilibria) as\nthe number of agents tends to infinity. It supposes that the rational agents\nare indistinguishable and individually have a negligible influence on the game,\nand that each individual strategy is influenced by some averages of quantities\ndepending on the states (or the controls as in the present work) of the other\nagents. MFGs have been introduced in the pioneering works of J-M. Lasry and\nP-L. Lions [17, 18, 19].

There is not much\nliterature on MFGs in which the agents also interact through their controls,\nsee [13, 12, 8, 10, 7, 16]. To stress the fact that the latter situation is\nconsidered, we will sometimes use the terminology mean field games of control\nand the acronym MFGC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Mar 2020 08:47:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-10"}

Evidently, the collision between\nthe unmanned system and the obstacles, including both moving and static\nobjects, accounts for a great proportion of the system abnormalities. The route\nplanning and corresponding controller are established in order to avoid the\ncollision, whereas, in the presence of uncertainties, it is possible that the\nunmanned system would deviate from the predetermined route and collide with the\nobstacles. Therefore, for the safety of unmanned systems, collision probability\nestimation and further safety decision are very important. To estimate the\ncollision probability, the Monte Carlo method could be applied, however, it is\ngenerally rather slow. This paper introduces a fast collision probability\nestimation method based on finite-dimensional distribution, whose main idea is\nto filter out the sampling points needed and generate the states directly by\nsamples of finite-dimensional distribution, reducing the estimation time\nsignificantly. Besides, further techniques including the probabilistic\nequidistance sampling and dimension reduction, also serve to reduce the\nestimation time.

When phonon interactions with the dot are\ndisregarded - thus corresponding to the limit of atomic cavity systems -\nchirped pulses generate photon number distributions that change their shape\ndrastically in the course of time. Phonons have a strong and qualitative impact\non the photon statistics. The asymmetry between phonon absorption and emission\ndestroys the symmetry of the photon distributions obtained for positive and\nnegative chirps. While for negative chirps transient distributions resembling\nthermal ones are observed, for positive chirps the photon number distribution\nstill resembles its phonon-free counterpart but with overall smoother shapes.\nIn sharp contrast, using unchirped pulses of the same pulse area and duration\nwave-packets are found that move up and down the Jaynes-Cummings ladder with a\nbell-shape that changes little in time.

Price, an important factor\nin marketing --- which determines whether a user will make the final purchase\ndecision on an item --- surprisingly, has received relatively little scrutiny.\n  In this work, we aim at developing an effective method to predict user\npurchase intention with the focus on the price factor in recommender systems.\nThe main difficulties are two-fold: 1) the preference and sensitivity of a user\non item price are unknown, which are only implicitly reflected in the items\nthat the user has purchased, and 2) how the item price affects a user's\nintention depends largely on the product category, that is, the perception and\naffordability of a user on item price could vary significantly across\ncategories. Towards the first difficulty, we propose to model the transitive\nrelationship between user-to-item and item-to-price, taking the inspiration\nfrom the recently developed Graph Convolution Networks (GCN). The key idea is\nto propagate the influence of price on users with items as the bridge, so as to\nmake the learned user representations be price-aware. For the second\ndifficulty, we further integrate item categories into the propagation progress\nand model the possible pairwise interactions for predicting user-item\ninteractions.

CPO is critically\nimportant for airlines' business viability, considering that the crew operating\ncost is their second-largest expense. It poses an NP-hard combinatorial\noptimization problem, to tackle which, the state-of-the-art relies on relaxing\nthe underlying Integer Programming Problem (IPP) into a Linear Programming\nProblem (LPP), solving the latter through Column Generation (CG) technique, and\nintegerization of the resulting LPP solution. However, with the growing scale\nand complexity of the flight networks (those with a large number of flights,\nmultiple crew bases and/or multiple hub-and-spoke subnetworks), the utility of\nthe conventional CG-practices has become questionable. This paper proposed an\nAirline Crew Pairing Optimization Framework, AirCROP, whose constitutive\nmodules include the Legal Crew Pairing Generator, Initial Feasible Solution\nGenerator, and an Optimization Engine built on heuristic-based\nCG-implementation. In this paper, besides the design of AirCROP's modules,\ninsights into important questions related to how these modules interact, which\nthe literature is otherwise silent on, have been shared. These relate to the\nsensitivity of AirCROP's performance towards: sources of variability over\nmultiple runs for a given problem, initialization method, and termination\nparameters for LPP-solutioning and IPP-solutioning. The efficacy of the AirCROP\nhas been demonstrated on real-world large-scale and complex flight networks\n(with over 4200 flights, 15 crew bases, and billion-plus pairings). It is hoped\nthat with the emergence of such complex flight networks, this paper shall serve\nas an important milestone for affiliated research and applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Mar 2020 09:34:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2020 23:27:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-20"}

The Pauli\nparamagnetic effects and the orbital depairing effects due to vortices are\ntreated in an equal footing for three dimensional spherical Fermi surface model\nand $s$-wave pairing. The field evolution of the LO state is studied in detail,\nsuch as the $H$-$T$ phase diagram, spatial structures of the order parameter,\nthe paramagnetic moment, and the internal filed. Field-dependences of various\nthermodynamic quantities: the paramagnetic moment, entropy, and the zero-energy\ndensity of states are calculated. Those quantities are shown to start quickly\ngrowing upon entering the LO state. We also evaluate the wave length of the LO\nmodulation, the flux line lattice form factors for small angle neutron\nscattering, and the NMR spectra to facilitate the identification of the LO\nstate. Two cases of strong and intermediate Pauli paramagnetic effect are\nstudied comparatively. The possibility of the LO phase in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$,\nCeCoIn$_5$, CeCu$_2$Si$_2$, and the organic superconductors is critically\nexamined and crucial experiments to identify it are proposed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Mar 2020 09:36:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-18"}

However, ASR performance in noisy\nconditions of single-channel systems remains unsatisfactory. Indeed, most\nsingle-channel speech enhancement (SE) methods (denoising) have brought only\nlimited performance gains over state-of-the-art ASR back-end trained on\nmulti-condition training data. Recently, there has been much research on neural\nnetwork-based SE methods working in the time-domain showing levels of\nperformance never attained before. However, it has not been established whether\nthe high enhancement performance achieved by such time-domain approaches could\nbe translated into ASR. In this paper, we show that a single-channel\ntime-domain denoising approach can significantly improve ASR performance,\nproviding more than 30 % relative word error reduction over a strong ASR\nback-end on the real evaluation data of the single-channel track of the CHiME-4\ndataset. These positive results demonstrate that single-channel noise reduction\ncan still improve ASR performance, which should open the door to more research\nin that direction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Mar 2020 09:36:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-10"}

In a series of recent experiments in vitro\nit has been possible to replicate with an optogenetic theta frequency\nstimulation several features of cross-frequency coupling among theta and gamma\nrhythms observed in behaving animals. In order to reproduce the main findings\nof these experiments we have considered a new class of neural mass models able\nto reproduce exactly the macroscopic dynamics of spiking neural networks. In\nthis framework, we have examined two set-ups able to support collective gamma\noscillations: the pyramidal interneuronal network gamma (PING) and the\ninterneuronal network gamma (ING). In both set-ups we observe the emergence of\ntheta-nested gamma oscillations by driving the system with a sinusoidal\ntheta-forcing in proximity of a Hopf bifurcation. These mixed rhythms display\nalways phase amplitude coupling. However 2 different types of nested\noscillations can be identified: one characterized by a perfect phase locking\nbetween theta and gamma rhythms, corresponding to an overall periodic\nbehaviour; another one where the locking is imperfect and the dynamics is\nquasi-periodic or even chaotic. From our analysis it emerges that the locked\nstates are more frequent in the ING set-up. In agreement with the experiments,\nwe find theta-nested gamma oscillations for forcing frequencies in the range\n[1:10] Hz, whose amplitudes grow proportionally to the forcing one and which\nare clearly modulated by the theta phase. At variance with experimental\nfindings, the gamma-power peak does not shift to higher frequencies by\nincreasing the theta frequency. This effect can be obtained, in or model, only\nby incrementing, at the same time, also the noise or the forcing amplitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Mar 2020 09:40:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-16"}

Existing methods\nmainly focus on adapting domain-invariant features (what to transfer) through\nadversarial learning (how to transfer). Context dependency is essential for\nsemantic segmentation, however, its transferability is still not well\nunderstood. Furthermore, how to transfer contextual information across two\ndomains remains unexplored. Motivated by this, we propose a cross-attention\nmechanism based on self-attention to capture context dependencies between two\ndomains and adapt transferable context. To achieve this goal, we design two\ncross-domain attention modules to adapt context dependencies from both spatial\nand channel views. Specifically, the spatial attention module captures local\nfeature dependencies between each position in the source and target image. The\nchannel attention module models semantic dependencies between each pair of\ncross-domain channel maps. To adapt context dependencies, we further\nselectively aggregate the context information from two domains.

Barnette proved that a $3$-connected\nplanar graph contains a spanning tree of maximum degree at most $3$. A local\ntranslation of this statement is that if $G$ is a planar graph, $X$ is a subset\nof specified vertices of $G$ such that $X$ cannot be separated in $G$ by\nremoving $2$ or fewer vertices of $G$, then $G$ has a tree of maximum degree at\nmost $3$ containing all vertices of $X$.\n  Our results constitute a general machinery for strengthening statements about\n$k$-connected graphs (for $1 \\leq k \\leq 4$) to locally spanning versions, i.e.\nsubgraphs containing a set $X\\subseteq V(G)$ of a (not necessarily planar)\ngraph $G$ in which only $X$ has high connectedness.

We analysed the data obtained by two missions, Helios spanning the\ndistances between 65 and 215 R$_S$, and Parker Solar Probe (PSP) reaching down\nto 35 R$_S$ during its first two orbits around the Sun. The electron strahl was\ncharacterised with two parameters, pitch-angle width (PAW), and the strahl\nparallel temperature (T$_{s\\parallel}$). PSP observations confirm the already\nreported dependence of strahl PAW on core parallel plasma beta\n($\\beta_{ec\\parallel}$)\\citep{Bercic2019}. Most of the strahl measured by PSP\nappear narrow with PAW reaching down to 30$^o$. The portion of the strahl\nvelocity distribution function aligned with the magnetic field is for the\nmeasured energy range well described by a Maxwellian distribution function.\nT$_{s\\parallel}$ was found to be anti-correlated with the solar wind velocity,\nand independent of radial distance. These observations imply that\nT$_{s\\parallel}$ carries the information about the coronal electron\ntemperature. The obtained values are in agreement with coronal temperatures\nmeasured using spectroscopy (David et al. 2998), and the inferred solar wind\nsource regions during the first orbit of PSP agree with the predictions using a\nPFSS model (Bale et al. 2019, Badman et al. 2019).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Mar 2020 10:13:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-08"}

Their pulsation period is related to the luminosity and mass-loss\nrate of the star. The long-period variables (LPVs) and Mira variables are the\nmost prominent of all types of variability of evolved stars. The reddest, most\nobscured AGB stars are too faint in the optical and have eluded large\nvariability surveys. Selection criteria are derived based on colour-colour and\ncolour-magnitude diagrams from the combination of VISTA Magellanic Cloud (VMC)\nsurvey, Spitzer IRAC and AllWISE data. After eliminating LPVs with known\nperiods shorter than 450 days, a sample of 1299 candidate obscured AGB stars is\nselected. K-band LCs are constructed combining the epoch photometry available\nin the VMC survey with literature data, analysed for variability and fitted\nwith a single period sine curve to derive mean magnitudes, amplitudes and\nperiods. A subset of 254 stars are either new variables, or known variables\nwhere the period we find is better determined than the literature value, or\nlonger than 1000 days. The spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of these stars\nare fitted to a large number of templates. For this purpose the SEDs and\nSpitzer IRS spectra of some non-AGB stars are also fitted to have templates of\nthe most likely contaminants in the sample. A sample of 217 likely LPVs is\nfound.

However, for symmetric\nencryption methods, the well-known encryption techniques still rely on the key\nspace to guarantee security and suffer from frequent key updating. Aiming to\nsolve those problems, this paper proposes a novel text encryption method based\non deep learning called TEDL, where the secret key includes hyperparameters in\ndeep learning model and the core step of encryption is transforming input data\ninto weights trained under hyperparameters. Firstly, both communication parties\nestablish a word vector table by training a deep learning model according to\nspecified hyperparameters. Then, a self-update codebook is constructed on the\nword vector table with the SHA-256 function and other tricks. When\ncommunication starts, encryption and decryption are equivalent to indexing and\ninverted indexing on the codebook, respectively, thus achieving the\ntransformation between plaintext and ciphertext. Results of experiments and\nrelevant analyses show that TEDL performs well for security, efficiency,\ngenerality, and has a lower demand for the frequency of key redistribution.\nEspecially, as a supplement to current encryption methods, the time-consuming\nprocess of constructing a codebook increases the difficulty of brute-force\nattacks while not degrade the communication efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Mar 2020 11:04:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Mar 2020 03:47:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-12"}

The resistance of the outer path may be given by plasma contact\nwith a very resistive structure or by a sudden decrease of the outer plasma\ntemperature (e.g. due to a partial thermal quench or due to a cold front\npenetration caused by massive gas injection). For general plasma geometries and\ncurrent density profiles the model shows that given a small change of minor\nradius ($\\delta a$) the plasma current is conserved to first order ($\\delta I_p\n= 0 + \\mathcal{O}(\\delta a^2)$). This conservation comes from the fact that\ntotal inductance remains constant ($\\delta L = 0$) due to an exact compensation\nof the change of external inductance with the change of internal inductance\n($\\delta L_\\text{ext}+\\delta L_\\text{int} = 0$). As the total current is\nconserved and the plasma volume is reduced, the edge safety factor drops\naccording to $q_a \\propto a^2/I_p$. Finally the consistency of the resulting\nanalytical predictions is checked with the help of free-boundary MHD\nsimulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Mar 2020 12:30:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-10"}

The system contains a Delta Scuti pulsator in a\n1.6-d orbit, whose pulsation mode amplitude is strongly modulated at the\norbital frequency, which can be explained if the pulsations have a much larger\namplitude in one hemisphere of the star.

We propose\nImage-Instance Full Alignment Networks (iFAN) to tackle this problem by\nprecisely aligning feature distributions on both image and instance levels: 1)\nImage-level alignment: multi-scale features are roughly aligned by training\nadversarial domain classifiers in a hierarchically-nested fashion. 2) Full\ninstance-level alignment: deep semantic information and elaborate instance\nrepresentations are fully exploited to establish a strong relationship among\ncategories and domains. Establishing these correlations is formulated as a\nmetric learning problem by carefully constructing instance pairs.\nAbove-mentioned adaptations can be integrated into an object detector (e.g.\nFaster RCNN), resulting in an end-to-end trainable framework where multiple\nalignments can work collaboratively in a coarse-tofine manner.

It is expected to play an important role in the\ndecarbonisation of the energy sector in the coming years. In district heating,\nheat is traditionally generated through fossil fuels, often with combined heat\nand power (CHP) units. However, increasingly, waste heat is being used as a low\ncarbon alternative, either directly or, for low temperature sources, via a heat\npump. The design of district heating often has competing objectives: the need\nfor inexpensive energy and meeting low carbon targets. In addition, the\nplanning of district heating schemes is subject to multiple sources of\nuncertainty such as variability in heat demand and energy prices. This paper\nproposes a decision support tool to analyse and compare system designs for\ndistrict heating under uncertainty using stochastic ordering (dominance).\nContrary to traditional uncertainty metrics that provide statistical summaries\nand impose total ordering, stochastic ordering is a partial ordering and\noperates with full probability distributions.

The exact two coexisting resonant modes that underpin an embedded\ntrapped mode in a cavity open to two semi-infinite ducts are numerically\ndemonstrated. At the interface between the cavity segment and a duct, total\nreflection can occur for a particular combination of two propagative guided\nwaves in the cavity.

The\nobjective is a multi-letter expression, whose analytic solution is only known\nfor a few specific cases. When no analytic solution is present or the channel\nmodel is unknown, there is no unified framework for calculating or even\napproximating capacity. This work proposes a novel capacity estimation\nalgorithm that treats the channel as a `black-box', both when feedback is or is\nnot present. The algorithm has two main ingredients: (i) a neural distribution\ntransformer (NDT) model that shapes a noise variable into the channel input\ndistribution, which we are able to sample, and (ii) the DI neural estimator\n(DINE) that estimates the communication rate of the current NDT model.

The\nmethod is demonstrated on the moving average additive Gaussian noise channel,\nwhere it is shown that both the capacity and feedback capacity are estimated\nwithout knowledge of the channel transition kernel.

This complexity, coming from high dimensionality and continuousness of\nthe environments considered herein, calls for a large number of learning trials\nto learn about the environment through Reinforcement Learning. Imitation\nLearning (IL) offers a promising solution for those challenges using a teacher.\nIn IL, the learning process can take advantage of human-sourced assistance\nand/or control over the agent and environment.

We show in this work that dispersal can be a\ndestabilising influence. To do this, we combine ideas from Alan Turing's work\non pattern formation with May's random-matrix approach.

The analysis is based on the Binomial Sign Test for a\nSingle Sample. The sample of signs is generated by subtracting the daily mean\nconcentration of PM2.5 for the measurements of the period of two years: 20xx\nand 2019.

The process of finding the model parameters\nrequires numeric inputs, either based in medical imaging techniques, or other\nmeasures. Inputs can be processed by iterative methods (inverse elasticity\nsolvers). Such solvers are highly robust and provide solutions within the\nrequired degree of accuracy.
