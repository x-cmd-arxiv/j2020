This holds also for linear matroids that admit a\nrepresentation where every point is associated to a vector with at most two\nnonzero coordinates. We also show that the same is true for computing the Tutte\npolynomial of a binary matroid of dimension $k$ on $k^{O(1)}$ points with at\nmost three nonzero coordinates in each point's vector. This is in sharp\ncontrast to computing the Tutte polynomial of a $k$-vertex graph (that is, the\nTutte polynomial of a {\\em graphic} matroid of dimension $k$---which is\nrepresentable in dimension $k$ over the binary field so that every vector has\ntwo nonzero coordinates), which is known to be computable in $2^k k^{O(1)}$\ntime [Bj\\\"orklund {\\em et al.}, FOCS 2008]. Our lower-bound proofs proceed via\n(i) a connection due to Crapo and Rota [1970] between the number of tuples of\ncodewords of full support and the Tutte polynomial of the matroid associated\nwith the code; (ii) an earlier-established \\#ETH-hardness of counting the\nsolutions to a bipartite $(d,2)$-CSP on $n$ vertices in $d^{o(n)}$ time; and\n(iii) new embeddings of such CSP instances as questions about codewords of full\nsupport in a linear code. We complement these lower bounds with two algorithm\ndesigns. The first design computes the Tutte polynomial of a linear matroid of\ndimension~$k$ on $k^{O(1)}$ points in $k^{O(k)}$ operations.

The presence of the\nnanoshell nearby the quantum dot gives rise to two principal effects: (i) --\nrenormalization of the applied field amplitude and (ii) -- renormalization of\nthe resonance frequencies and radiation relaxation rates of the quantum dot,\nboth depending on the the quantum dot level populations. We show that in the\nperturbation regime, when the excitonic levels are only slightly populated,\neach of these factors may give rise to either suppression or enhancement of the\ntwo-photon absorption. The complicated interplay of the two determines the\nfinal effect. Beyond the perturbation regime, it is found that the two-photon\nabsorption experiences a drastic enhancement, which occurs independently of the\ntype of excitation, either into the one-exciton resonance or into the\ntwo-photon resonance. Other characteristic features of the two-photon\nabsorption of the composite, emerging from the coupling between both\nnanoparticles, are bistability and self-oscillations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Mar 2020 17:22:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Jan 2021 22:21:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-08"}

The orderings of binomials --- lists of two words separated by `and'\nor `or' --- has been studied for more than a century. These binomials are\ncommon across many areas of speech, in both formal and informal text. In the\nlast century, numerous explanations have been given to describe what order\npeople use for these binomials, from differences in semantics to differences in\nphonology. These rules describe primarily `frozen' binomials that exist in\nexactly one ordering and have lacked large-scale trials to determine efficacy.\n  Online text provides a unique opportunity to study these lists in the context\nof informal text at a very large scale. In this work, we expand the view of\nbinomials to include a large-scale analysis of both frozen and non-frozen\nbinomials in a quantitative way. Using this data, we then demonstrate that most\npreviously proposed rules are ineffective at predicting binomial ordering. By\ntracking the order of these binomials across time and communities we are able\nto establish additional, unexplored dimensions central to these predictions.\n  Expanding beyond the question of individual binomials, we also explore the\nglobal structure of binomials in various communities, establishing a new model\nfor these lists and analyzing this structure for non-frozen and frozen\nbinomials. Additionally, novel analysis of trinomials --- lists of length three\n--- suggests that none of the binomials analysis applies in these cases.\nFinally, we demonstrate how large data sets gleaned from the web can be used in\nconjunction with older theories to expand and improve on old questions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Mar 2020 17:22:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-10"}

For 3500K, the atmospheric\ngas is mainly composed of atoms (O, Na, Mg, Fe), metal oxides (SiO, NaO, MgO,\nCaO, AlO, FeO) and some metal hydroxides (KOH, NaOH). The inclusion of\nphyllosilicates as potential condensed species is crucial for lower\ntemperatures, as they can remove water from the gas phase below about 700K and\ninhibit the presence of liquid water. Measurements of the atmospheric\ncomposition could, in principle, characterise the rock composition of exoplanet\ncrusts. H2O, O2 and CH4 are natural products from the outgassing of different\nkinds of rocks that had time to equilibrate. These are discussed as biomarkers,\nbut do emerge naturally as result of the thermodynamic interaction between\ncrust and atmosphere. Only the simultaneous detection of all three molecules\nmight be a sufficient biosignature, as it is inconsistent with chemical\nequilibrium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Mar 2020 18:21:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

However, this is unnecessary and inefficient, as\nprior solutions can be used to inform future time steps.

Specifically, the amount of PIV information contained in\nsimultaneously measured OH-PLIF fields in the domain of a swirl-stabilized\ncombustor is sought. This task is accomplished using machine learning\ntechniques based on artificial neural networks designed to optimize PLIF-to-PIV\nmappings. It was found that most of the velocity information content could be\nretrieved when considering linear combinations of neighborhoods of OH-PLIF\nsignal spanning roughly two integral lengthscales (half of the considered\ndomain), and that PLIF signal interactions contained in smaller, local regions\n(less than half of the domain) contained no PIV information. Further, by\nvisualizing the coherent structures contained within the neural network\nparameters, the role of multi-scale interactions related to velocity field\nretrieval from the OH-PLIF signal became more apparent. Overall, this study\nreveals a useful pathway (in the form of overlapping information content\nextraction) to develop diagnostic tools that capture more information using the\nsame experimental resources by minimizing redundancy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Mar 2020 20:50:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-10"}

For each image or text anchor in a\ntraining mini-batch, the model is trained to distinguish between a positive and\nthe most confusing negative of the anchor mined from the mini-batch (i.e.\nonline hard negative). This strategy improves the model's capacity to discover\nfine-grained correspondences and non-correspondences between image and text\ninputs. However, the above approach has the following drawbacks: (1) the\nnegative selection strategy still provides limited chances for the model to\nlearn from very hard-to-distinguish cases. (2) The trained model has weak\ngeneralization capability from the training set to the testing set.

However, recent\nresearch has shown that ML models are vulnerable to multiple security and\nprivacy attacks. In particular, backdoor attacks against ML models have\nrecently raised a lot of awareness. A successful backdoor attack can cause\nsevere consequences, such as allowing an adversary to bypass critical\nauthentication systems.\n  Current backdooring techniques rely on adding static triggers (with fixed\npatterns and locations) on ML model inputs which are prone to detection by the\ncurrent backdoor detection mechanisms.

This has unique challenges--on top of teleoperation\nchallenges in general--due to difficulties of physical discrepancy between\nhuman hands and robot hands as well as the fine motion constraints to\nconstitute task success. We present an intuitive shared-control strategy where\nthe focus is on generating robotic grasp poses which are better suited for\nhuman perception of successful teleoperated object manipulation and feeling of\nbeing in control of the robot, rather than developing objective stable grasp\nconfigurations for task success or following the human motion. The former is\nachieved by understanding human intent and autonomously taking over control on\nthat inference. The latter is achieved by considering human inputs as hard\nmotion constraints which the robot must abide. An arbitration of these two\nenables a trade-off for the subsequent robot motion to balance accomplishing\nthe inferred task and motion constraints imposed by the operator.

The key contribution of this method\nis to learn the representation of error as high-level features, while current\nrepresentation learning methods interpret error by loss functions which are\nobtained as a function of differences between the true labels and the predicted\nones. One advantage of such learning method is that the learned features for\neach class are independent of learned features for other classes; therefore,\nthis method can learn simultaneously meaning that it can learn new classes\nwithout retraining. Error representation learning can also help with\ngeneralization and reduce the chance of over-fitting by adding a set of\nimpactful features to the original data set which capture the relationships\nbetween each instance and different classes through an error generation and\nanalysis process. This method can be particularly effective in data sets, where\nthe instances of each class have diverse feature representations or the ones\nwith imbalanced classes.

The propulsion can come from\nan external body force or from external shear flow. It may also come from\nexternally-induced stresses at the surface, arising from imposed chemical,\nthermal or electrical gradients. The resulting motion arises jointly from the\ndriven particle and the displaced fluid. If the objects are asymmetric, every\naspect of their motion and interaction depends on the orientation of the\nobjects. This orientation in turn changes in response to the driving. The\nobjects' shape can thus lead to a range of emergent anisotropic and chiral\nmotion not possible with isotropic spherical particles. We first consider what\naspects of a body's asymmetry can affect its drift through a fluid, especially\nchiral motion. We next discuss driving by injecting external force or torque\ninto the particles. Then we consider driving without injecting force or torque.\nThis includes driving by shear flow and driving by surface stresses, such as\nelectrophoresis. We consider how time-dependent driving can induce collective\norientational order and coherent motion. We show how a given particle shape can\nbe represented using an assembly of point forces called a Stokeslet object. We\nnext consider the interactions between anisotropic propelled particles, the\nsymmetries governing the interactions, and the possibility of bound pairs of\nparticles. Finally we show how the collective hydrodynamics of a suspension can\nbe qualitatively altered by the particles' shapes. The asymmetric responses\ndiscussed here are broadly relevant also for swimming propulsion of active\nmicron-scale objects such as microorganisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Mar 2020 01:56:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2020 22:07:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-14"}

An open question is how the dynamic facilitation theory of\nthe glass transition may be reconciled with thermodynamic theories that posit a\nvanishing configurational entropy. Dynamic facilitation theory invokes a\ndynamical phase transition, between an active phase (close to the normal\nliquid) and an inactive phase which is glassy, whose order parameter is either\ndynamic or a time-averaged structural quantity. In particular, the dynamical\nphase transition in systems with non-trivial thermodynamics manifests\nsignatures of a lower critical point, which lies close to the putative Kauzmann\ntemperature, where any thermodynamic phase transition to an ideal glass state\nmight occur. We discuss these findings, and suggest that the lower critical\npoint of the structural-dynamical phase transition may be related to the large\ndrop in configurational entropy that occurs in the inactive phase of the\ndynamical phase transition. Increasing supercooling thus brings configurational\nentropy of the normal liquid much lower, along with the temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Mar 2020 02:34:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Aug 2020 17:36:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-04"}

It plays a central role in many applications such as image search, face\nverification, and zero-shot learning. It is desirable to have a universal deep\nembedding model applicable to various domains of images. However, existing\nmethods mainly rely on training specialist embedding models each of which is\napplicable to images from a single domain. In this paper, we study an important\nbut unexplored task: how to train a single universal image embedding model to\nmatch the performance of several specialists on each specialist's domain.\nSimply fusing the training data from multiple domains cannot solve this problem\nbecause some domains become overfitted sooner when trained together using\nexisting methods. Therefore, we propose to distill the knowledge in multiple\nspecialists into a universal embedding to solve this problem. In contrast to\nexisting embedding distillation methods that distill the absolute distances\nbetween images, we transform the absolute distances between images into a\nprobabilistic distribution and minimize the KL-divergence between the\ndistributions of the specialists and the universal embedding. Using several\npublic datasets, we validate that our proposed method accomplishes the goal of\nuniversal image embedding.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Mar 2020 02:51:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-10"}

It requires models to recognize isolated sign words\nfrom videos. However, annotating WSLR data needs expert knowledge, thus\nlimiting WSLR dataset acquisition. On the contrary, there are abundant\nsubtitled sign news videos on the internet. Since these videos have no\nword-level annotation and exhibit a large domain gap from isolated signs, they\ncannot be directly used for training WSLR models. We observe that despite the\nexistence of a large domain gap, isolated and news signs share the same visual\nconcepts, such as hand gestures and body movements. Motivated by this\nobservation, we propose a novel method that learns domain-invariant visual\nconcepts and fertilizes WSLR models by transferring knowledge of subtitled news\nsign to them. To this end, we extract news signs using a base WSLR model, and\nthen design a classifier jointly trained on news and isolated signs to coarsely\nalign these two domain features. In order to learn domain-invariant features\nwithin each class and suppress domain-specific features, our method further\nresorts to an external memory to store the class centroids of the aligned news\nsigns. We then design a temporal attention based on the learnt descriptor to\nimprove recognition performance. Experimental results on standard WSLR datasets\nshow that our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods\nsignificantly.

This\nhierarchy encodes rich correlations among various categories across different\nlevels, which can effectively regularize the semantic space and thus make\npredictions less ambiguous. However, previous studies of fine-grained image\nretrieval primarily focus on semantic similarities or visual similarities. In a\nreal application, merely using visual similarity may not satisfy the need of\nconsumers to search merchandise with real-life images, e.g., given a red coat\nas a query image, we might get a red suit in recall results only based on\nvisual similarity since they are visually similar. But the users actually want\na coat rather than suit even the coat is with different color or texture\nattributes. We introduce this new problem based on photoshopping in real\npractice. That's why semantic information are integrated to regularize the\nmargins to make \"semantic\" prior to \"visual\". To solve this new problem, we\npropose a hierarchical adaptive semantic-visual tree (ASVT) to depict the\narchitecture of merchandise categories, which evaluates semantic similarities\nbetween different semantic levels and visual similarities within the same\nsemantic class simultaneously. The semantic information satisfies the demand of\nconsumers for similar merchandise with the query while the visual information\noptimizes the correlations within the semantic class.

However, the trial samples lack the complete ground truth\nbecause the observable parts of the agent are limited. That is, the information\ncontained in the trial samples is often insufficient to learn the specific\ngrasping position of each object. Consequently, the training falls into a local\nsolution, and the grasp positions learned by the robot are independent of the\nstate of the object. In this study, the optimal grasping position of an\nindividual object is determined from the grasping score, defined as the\ndistance in the feature space obtained using metric learning. The closeness of\nthe solution to the pre-designed optimal grasping position was evaluated in\ntrials. The proposed method incorporates two types of feedback control: one\nfeedback enlarges the grasping score when the grasping position approaches the\noptimum; the other reduces the negative feedback of the potential grasping\npositions among the grasping candidates. The proposed online self-supervised\nlearning method employs two deep neural networks. : SSD that detects the\ngrasping position of an object, and Siamese networks (SNs) that evaluate the\ntrial sample using the similarity of two input data in the feature space.

A model predictive\ncontrol approach is used to handle the uncertainties and price variations. This\nin-turn requires solving a time-coupled multi-time step MINLP during each\ntime-epoch which is computationally intensive.

In the visible or longer-wavelength domains,\nnear-resonant light fields have become the primary tool to control electron\ndynamics. Recently, coherent control in the extreme-ultraviolet range was\ndemonstrated, with timing stability of the applied light fields in the\nfew-attosecond range. At hard x-ray energies, M\\\"ossbauer nuclei feature narrow\nnuclear resonances, and spectroscopy of these resonances is a widespread tool\nto study magnetic, structural and dynamical properties of matter. It has been\nshown that the power and scope of M\\\"ossbauer spectroscopy can be significantly\nadvanced using various control techniques. However, the coherent control of\natomic nuclei using near-resonant x-ray fields remains an open challenge, also\nbecause of the extreme stability requirements on the x-ray light in the\nfew-zeptosecond range. Here, we demonstrate such control, and use the relative\nphase of two x-ray pulses to switch the nuclear dynamics between stimulated\nemission and enhanced coherent excitation.

Fringe fields that are\npresent at both ends of the air-gap limit the region where the flux density\ndoes not change more than a certain relative fraction (here: $5\\times 10^{-4}$)\nof the flux density in the center of the magnet system. By simply adding an\niron ring with a rectangular cross-section to the inner yoke at each end of the\nair gap, the effects of the fringe fields can be counteracted, and, hence, the\nlength of the region, where the flux density remains within a given tolerance\nband is increased.

However, three major problems still\nexist among these models: (1) they are computationally expensive; (2) they\nusually lack explicit constraints on global shapes; (3) domain gaps are\ncommonly present. To address these problems, we propose Pixel-in-Pixel Net\n(PIPNet) for facial landmark detection. The proposed model is equipped with a\nnovel detection head based on heatmap regression, which conducts score and\noffset predictions simultaneously on low-resolution feature maps. By doing so,\nrepeated upsampling layers are no longer necessary, enabling the inference time\nto be largely reduced without sacrificing model accuracy. Besides, a simple but\neffective neighbor regression module is proposed to enforce local constraints\nby fusing predictions from neighboring landmarks, which enhances the robustness\nof the new detection head. To further improve the cross-domain generalization\ncapability of PIPNet, we propose self-training with curriculum. This training\nstrategy is able to mine more reliable pseudo-labels from unlabeled data across\ndomains by starting with an easier task, then gradually increasing the\ndifficulty to provide more precise labels.

DADA relaxes the\ndiscrete DA policy selection to a differentiable optimization problem via\nGumbel-Softmax. In addition, we introduce an unbiased gradient estimator,\nRELAX, leading to an efficient and effective one-pass optimization strategy to\nlearn an efficient and accurate DA policy. We conduct extensive experiments on\nCIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, SVHN, and ImageNet datasets. Furthermore, we demonstrate\nthe value of Auto DA in pre-training for downstream detection problems. Results\nshow our DADA is at least one order of magnitude faster than the\nstate-of-the-art while achieving very comparable accuracy.

Among its many\nvariants, open set domain adaptation (OSDA) is perhaps the most challenging, as\nit further assumes the presence of unknown classes in the target domain. In\nthis paper, we study OSDA with a particular focus on enriching its ability to\ntraverse across larger domain gaps. Firstly, we show that existing\nstate-of-the-art methods suffer a considerable performance drop in the presence\nof larger domain gaps, especially on a new dataset (PACS) that we re-purposed\nfor OSDA.

For efficient migration cells require a\nmechanism for polarization, so that traction forces are produced in the\ndirection of motion, while adhesion is released to allow forward migration. To\nsimplify the study of this process cells have been studied when placed along\none-dimensional tracks, where single cells exhibit both smooth and stick-slip\nmigration modes. The stick-slip motility mode is characterized by protrusive\nmotion at the cell front, coupled with slow cell elongation, which is followed\nby rapid retractions of the cell back. In this study, we explore a minimal\nphysical model that couples the force applied on the adhesion bonds to the\nlength variations of the cell and the traction forces applied by the polarized\nactin retrograde flow. We show that the rich spectrum of cell migration\npatterns emerges from this model as different \\emph{deterministic} dynamical\nphases. This result suggests a source for the large cell-to-cell variability\n(CCV) in cell migration patterns observed in single cells over time and within\ncell populations. The large heterogeneity can arise from small fluctuations in\nthe cellular components that are greatly amplified due to moving the cells'\ninternal state across the dynamical phase transition lines.

These results offer a new\nframework to explain experimental observations of migrating cells, resulting\nfrom noisy switching between underlying deterministic migration modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Mar 2020 14:56:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-19"}

Thus,\nk-space undersampling is used to accelerate the acquisition of MRI while\nleading to visually poor MR images. Recently, some studies 1) use effective\nundersampling patterns, or 2) design deep neural networks to improve the\nquality of resulting images. However, they are considered as two separate\noptimization strategies. In this paper, we propose a cross-domain network for\nMR image reconstruction, in a retrospective data-driven manner, under limited\nsampling rates. Our method can simultaneously obtain the optimal undersampling\npattern (in k-space) and the reconstruction model, which are customized to the\ntype of training data, by using an end-to-end learning strategy. We propose a\n1D probabilistic undersampling layer, to obtain the optimal undersampling\npattern and its probability distribution in a differentiable way.

Existing methods that synchronize simple sets are mainly based\non compact data structures such as Bloom filter and its variants. However,\nthese methods are infeasible to synchronize a pair of multisets which allow an\nelement to appear for multiple times. To this end, in this paper, we propose to\nleverage the counting cuckoo filter (CCF), a novel variant of cuckoo filter, to\nrepresent and thereafter synchronize a pair of multisets. The cuckoo filter\n(CF) is a minimized hash table that uses cuckoo hashing to resolve collisions.\nCF has an array of buckets, each of which has multiple slots to store element\nfingerprints. Based on CF, CCF extends each slot as two fields, the fingerprint\nfield and the counter field. The fingerprint field records the fingerprint of\nelement which is stored by this slot; while the counter field counts the\nmultiplicity of the stored element. With such a design, CCF is competent to\nrepresent any multiset. After generating and exchanging the respective CCFs\nwhich represent the local multi-sets, we propose the query-based and the\ndecoding-based methods to identify the different elements between the given\nmultisets. The comprehensive evaluation results indicate that CCF outperforms\nthe counting Bloom filter (CBF) when they are used to synchronize multisets, in\nterms of both synchronization accuracy and the space-efficiency, at the cost of\na little higher time-consumption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Mar 2020 15:38:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-10"}

Network integrity and\nrobustness are important to ensure that crucial networks are protected and\nundesired harmful networks can be dismantled.

Our proposed NIPA has been tested for different network benchmarks\nand compared with three other methods: optimal attack strategy (OAS), high\nbetweenness first (HBF) and high degree first (HDF). Experiments suggest that\nthe proposed NIPA is most effective among all four methods. In general, NIPA\ncan identify the most crucial node combination with higher effectiveness, and\nthe set of optimal key nodes found by our proposed NIPA is much smaller than\nthat by heuristic centrality prediction. In addition, many previously neglected\nweakly connected nodes are identified, which become a crucial part of the newly\nidentified optimal nodes. Thus, revised strategies for protection are\nrecommended to ensure the safeguard of network integrity.

The idea is based on the\neffects of the delay on the geometry of the reconstructions. If the delay is\nchosen too small, the reconstructed dynamics are flattened along the main\ndiagonal of the embedding space; too-large delays, on the other hand, can\noverfold the dynamics. Calculating the curvature of a two-dimensional delay\nreconstruction is an effective way to identify these extremes and to find a\nmiddle ground between them: both the sharp reversals at the ends of an\ninsufficiently unfolded reconstruction and the folds in an overfolded one\ncreate spikes in the curvature. We operationalize this observation by computing\nthe mean over the Menger curvature of 2D reconstructions for different time\ndelays. We show that the mean of these values gives an effective heuristic for\nchoosing the time delay. In addition, we show that this curvature-based\nheuristic is useful even in cases where the customary approach, which uses\naverage mutual information, fails --- e.g., noisy or filtered data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Mar 2020 23:51:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-10"}

Traditional approaches use cameras, body sensor networks,\nor radio patterns from various sources for activity recognition. However, these\napproaches are limited due to ease-of-use, coverage, or privacy preserving\nissues. In this paper, we present a novel wearable Radio Frequency\nIdentification (RFID) system aims at providing an easy-to-use solution with\nhigh detection coverage. Our system uses passive tags which are\nmaintenance-free and can be embedded into the clothes to reduce the wearing and\nmaintenance efforts. A small RFID reader is also worn on the user's body to\nextend the detection coverage as the user moves. We exploit RFID radio patterns\nand extract both spatial and temporal features to characterize various\nactivities. We also address the issues of false negative of tag readings and\ntag/antenna calibration, and design a fast online recognition system. Antenna\nand tag selection is done automatically to explore the minimum number of\ndevices required to achieve target accuracy. We develop a prototype system\nwhich consists of a wearable RFID system and a smartphone to demonstrate the\nworking principles, and conduct experimental studies with four subjects over\ntwo weeks. The results show that our system achieves a high recognition\naccuracy of 93.6 percent with a latency of 5 seconds. Additionally, we show\nthat the system only requires two antennas and four tagged body parts to\nachieve a high recognition accuracy of 85 percent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Mar 2020 08:08:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-18"}

Despite recent advances, most visualization\napproaches, in particular, multidimensional projection or dimensionality\nreduction techniques, cannot be directly applied in such scenarios due to the\ntransient nature of streaming data. Currently, only a few methods address this\nlimitation using online or incremental strategies, continuously processing\ndata, and updating the visualization. Despite their relative success, most of\nthem impose the need for storing and accessing the data multiple times, not\nbeing appropriate for streaming where data continuously grow. Others do not\nimpose such requirements but are not capable of updating the position of the\ndata already projected, potentially resulting in visual artifacts. In this\npaper, we present Xtreaming, a novel incremental projection technique that\ncontinuously updates the visual representation to reflect new emerging\nstructures or patterns without visiting the multidimensional data more than\nonce. Our tests show that Xtreaming is competitive in terms of global distance\npreservation if compared to other streaming and incremental techniques, but it\nis orders of magnitude faster.
