Most existing methods apply visual attention\nheuristically by learning an additional attention map to re-weight the feature\nmaps for person re-identification.

In this paper, we propose to\nincorporate the attention learning as additional objectives in a person ReID\nnetwork without changing the original structure, thus maintain the same\ninference time and model size. Two kinds of attentions have been considered to\nmake the learned feature maps being aware of the person and related body parts\nrespectively. Globally, a holistic attention branch (HAB) makes the feature\nmaps obtained by backbone focus on persons so as to alleviate the influence of\nbackground. Locally, a partial attention branch (PAB) makes the extracted\nfeatures be decoupled into several groups and be separately responsible for\ndifferent body parts (i.e., keypoints), thus increasing the robustness to pose\nvariation and partial occlusion. These two kinds of attentions are universal\nand can be incorporated into existing ReID networks.

We present an efficient algorithm for finding all the vertices of the\narrangement $A(L)$ of maximum level, where the level of a vertex $v$ is the\nnumber of lines of $L$ that pass strictly below $v$. The problem, posed in\nExercise~8.13 in de Berg etal [BCKO08], appears to be much harder than it\nseems, as this vertex might not be on the upper envelope of the lines.\n  We first assume that all the lines of $L$ are distinct, and distinguish\nbetween two cases, depending on whether or not the upper envelope of $L$\ncontains a bounded edge. In the former case, we show that the number of lines\nof $L$ that pass above any maximum level vertex $v_0$ is only $O(\\log n)$. In\nthe latter case, we establish a similar property that holds after we remove\nsome of the lines that are incident to the single vertex of the upper envelope.\nWe present algorithms that run, in both cases, in optimal $O(n\\log n)$ time.\n  We then consider the case where the lines of $L$ are not necessarily\ndistinct. This setup is more challenging, and the best we have is an algorithm\nthat computes all the maximum-level vertices in time $O(n^{4/3}\\log^{3}n)$.\n  Finally, we consider a related combinatorial question for degenerate\narrangements, where many lines may intersect in a single point, but all the\nlines are distinct: We bound the complexity of the weighted $k$-level in such\nan arrangement, where the weight of a vertex is the number of lines that pass\nthrough the vertex. We show that the bound in this case is $O(n^{4/3})$, which\nmatches the corresponding bound for non-degenerate arrangements, and we use\nthis bound in the analysis of one of our algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Mar 2020 16:33:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-03"}

Specifically, by defining a symbol pair as two symbols from the two\nsources, we first derive the exact symbol pair error rate (SPER) of the system.\nNoting that the generations of the exact SPER are complicated due to the\nirregularity of the decision regions caused by random channel coefficients, we\npropose a coordinate transform (CT) method to simplify the derivations of the\nSPER. Next, we prove that with a power scaling factor at relay, our PANC scheme\ncan achieve full diversity gain, i.e., two-order diversity gain, of the system,\nwhile the CXNC can only achieve one-order diversity gain due to multi-user\ninterference. In addition, we optimize the power levels at the relay to\nequivalently minimize the SPER at the destination concerning the relationship\nbetween SPER and minimum Euclidean distance of the received constellation.\nSimulation results show that (1) the SPER derived based on our CT method can\nwell approximate the exact SPER with a much lower complexity; (2) the PANC\nscheme with power level optimizations and power scaling factor design can\nachieve full diversity, and obtain a much higher coding gain than the PANC\nscheme with randomly chosen power levels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Mar 2020 17:07:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-03"}

The pipeline of ZoomNet\nbegins with an ordinary 2D object detection model which is used to obtain pairs\nof left-right bounding boxes.

The main advantage to using this is generalisation of\na task by retargeting a systems redundancy as well as the capability to fully\nreplace an entire system with another of varying link number and lengths while\nstill accurately repeating a task subject to the same constraints. The\neffectiveness of the method has been demonstrated in a 3-link simulation and a\nreal world experiment using a human subject as the demonstrator and is verified\nthrough task reproduction on a 7DoF physical robot. In simulation, the method\nworks accurately with even as little as five data points producing errors less\nthan 10^-14. The approach is shown to outperform the current state-of-the-art\napproach in a simulated 3DoF robot manipulator control problem where motions\nare reproduced using learnt constraints. Retargeting of a systems null space\ncomponent is also demonstrated in a task where controlling how redundancy is\nresolved allows for obstacle avoidance. Finally, the approach is verified in a\nreal world experiment using demonstrations from a human subject where the\nlearnt task space trajectory is transferred onto a 7DoF physical robot of a\ndifferent embodiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Mar 2020 18:30:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-03"}

At present, the most effective\nand widely-used activation function is ReLU. However, because of the non-zero\nmean, negative missing and unbounded output, ReLU is at a potential\ndisadvantage during optimization. To this end, we introduce a novel activation\nfunction to manage to overcome the above three challenges. The proposed\nnonlinearity, namely \"Soft-Root-Sign\" (SRS), is smooth, non-monotonic, and\nbounded. Notably, the bounded property of SRS distinguishes itself from most\nstate-of-the-art activation functions. In contrast to ReLU, SRS can adaptively\nadjust the output by a pair of independent trainable parameters to capture\nnegative information and provide zero-mean property, which leading not only to\nbetter generalization performance, but also to faster learning speed. It also\navoids and rectifies the output distribution to be scattered in the\nnon-negative real number space, making it more compatible with batch\nnormalization (BN) and less sensitive to initialization. In experiments, we\nevaluated SRS on deep networks applied to a variety of tasks, including image\nclassification, machine translation and generative modelling. Our SRS matches\nor exceeds models with ReLU and other state-of-the-art nonlinearities, showing\nthat the proposed activation function is generalized and can achieve high\nperformance across tasks. Ablation study further verified the compatibility\nwith BN and self-adaptability for different initialization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Mar 2020 18:38:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-03"}

Boneh and Zhandry (CRYPTO'13) initiated this research area for PKE and\nsymmetric key encryption (SKE), albeit restricted to a classical\nindistinguishability phase. Gagliardoni et al. (CRYPTO'16) advanced the study\nof quantum security by giving, for SKE, the first definition with a quantum\nindistinguishability phase. For PKE, on the other hand, no notion of quantum\nsecurity with a quantum indistinguishability phase exists. Our main result is a\nnovel quantum security notion (qIND-qCPA) for PKE with a quantum\nindistinguishability phase, which closes the aforementioned gap.

However, we identify a class of PKE schemes - which we call recoverable -\nand show that for this class type-2 operators require merely the public key.\nMoreover, recoverable schemes allow to realise type-2 operators even if they\nsuffer from decryption failures, which in general thwarts the reversibility\nmandated by type-2 operators.

Because the point spread function can reflect performance of the\nwhole optic system, it is appropriate to use the point spread function to\ndescribe atmospheric turbulence induced aberrations. Assuming point spread\nfunctions induced by the atmospheric turbulence with the same profile belong to\nthe same manifold space, we propose a non-parametric point spread function --\nPSF-NET. The PSF-NET has a cycle convolutional neural network structure and is\na statistical representation of the manifold space of PSFs induced by the\natmospheric turbulence with the same profile.

We address\nthese questions with three main contributions: (i) we provide uniform\nnon-asymptotic, deterministic model assessment guarantees for approximate CV;\n(ii) we show that (roughly) the same conditions also guarantee model selection\nperformance comparable to CV; (iii) we provide a proximal Newton extension of\nthe approximate CV framework for non-smooth prediction problems and develop\nimproved assessment guarantees for problems such as l1-regularized ERM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 2020 00:30:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 2020 02:03:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-12"}

The objective is to let the\ndestination be synchronized with the source in a timely manner once a status\nchange happens. What complicates the problem is that the transmission takes\nmultiple time slots due to the link-rate constraint. Thus, the transmitter has\nto decide to switch or to skip a new update when the status of the monitored\nsignal changes and it has not completed the transmission of the previous one\nyet. We adopt a metric called \"Age of Synchronization\" (AoS) to measure the\n\"dissatisfaction\" of the destination when it is desynchronized with the source.\nThen, the objective of this paper is to minimize the time-average AoS by\ndesigning optimal transmission policies for the transmitter.

Identifying such useful distant\ncontributions is challenging due to scalability issues (too many nodes can\npotentially contribute) and oversmoothing (aggregating features from too many\nnodes risks swamping out relevant information and may result in nodes having\ndifferent labels but indistinguishable features). We introduce a global\nattention mechanism where a node can selectively attend to, and aggregate\nfeatures from, any other node in the graph. The attention coefficients depend\non the Euclidean distance between learnable node embeddings, and we show that\nthe resulting attention-based global aggregation scheme is analogous to\nhigh-dimensional Gaussian filtering.

It only captures the dynamics of a scene\nand is able to capture almost \"continuous\" motion. However, different from\nframe-based camera that reflects the whole appearance as scenes are, the event\ncamera casts away the detailed characteristics of objects, such as texture and\ncolor. To take advantages of both modalities, the event camera and frame-based\ncamera are combined together for various machine vision tasks. Then the\ncross-modal matching between neuromorphic events and color images plays a vital\nand essential role. In this paper, we propose the Event-Based Image Retrieval\n(EBIR) problem to exploit the cross-modal matching task. Given an event stream\ndepicting a particular object as query, the aim is to retrieve color images\ncontaining the same object. This problem is challenging because there exists a\nlarge modality gap between neuromorphic events and color images.

Methodologically, existing methods, either\ndeterministic or stochastic, have applied different assumptions to impute\nmissing values. However, once the missing values are imputed, most existing\nmethods do not consider the fidelity or confidence of the imputed values in the\nmodeling of downstream tasks.

However, most successful robotic motion estimation\nmethods (e.g. VO, SLAM, SfM) and vision systems (e.g. CNN, visual place\nrecognition-VPR) are often separately used for mapping and localization tasks.\nConversely, recent reinforcement learning (RL) based methods for visual\nnavigation rely on the quality of GPS data reception, which may not be reliable\nwhen directly using it as ground truth across multiple, month-spaced traversals\nin large environments. In this paper, we propose a novel motion and visual\nperception approach, dubbed MVP, that unifies these two sensor modalities for\nlarge-scale, target-driven navigation tasks. Our MVP-based method can learn\nfaster, and is more accurate and robust to both extreme environmental changes\nand poor GPS data than corresponding vision-only navigation methods. MVP\ntemporally incorporates compact image representations, obtained using VPR, with\noptimized motion estimation data, including but not limited to those from VO or\noptimized radar odometry (RO), to efficiently learn self-supervised navigation\npolicies via RL. We evaluate our method on two large real-world datasets,\nOxford Robotcar and Nordland Railway, over a range of weather (e.g. overcast,\nnight, snow, sun, rain, clouds) and seasonal (e.g. winter, spring, fall,\nsummer) conditions using the new CityLearn framework; an interactive\nenvironment for efficiently training navigation agents. Our experimental\nresults, on traversals of the Oxford RobotCar dataset with no GPS data, show\nthat MVP can achieve 53% and 93% navigation success rate using VO and RO,\nrespectively, compared to 7% for a vision-only method.

The existence of other contact binaries in the\n1-10km range raises the question of how common these bodies are and how they\nevolved into contact. Here we consider that the lobes of MU69 formed as a\nbinary in the Solar nebula, and calculate its orbital evolution in the presence\nof gas. We find that the sub-Keplerian wind of the disk brings the drag\ntimescales for 10km bodies under 1 Myr for quadratic-velocity drag. In the\nKuiper belt, however, the drag is linear with velocity and the effect of the\nwind cancels out as the angular momentum gained in half an orbit is lost in the\nother half: the drag timescales for 10 km bodies remain over 10 Myr. In this\nsituation we find that a combination of drag and Kozai-Lidov oscillations is a\npromising channel for collapse. We analytically solve the hierarchical\nthree-body problem with drag and implement it into a Kozai plus tidal friction\nmodel. The permanent quadrupoles of the lobes make the Kozai oscillations\nstochastic, and as drag shrinks the semimajor axis it more easily allows the\nfluctuations to bring the system into contact. Evolution to contact happens\nvery rapidly (within $10^4$ yr) in the pure, double-average quadrupole, Kozai\nregion between $\\approx 85-95^\\circ$, and within 3 Myr in the drag-assisted\nregion beyond it. The synergy between $J_2$ and gas drag widens the window of\ncontact to 80-100$^\\circ$ initial inclination, over a larger range of semimajor\naxes. As such, the model predicts an initial contact binary fraction of about\n10\\% for the cold classicals in the Kuiper belt. The speed at contact deviates\nfrom the escape velocity only because of the oblateness. For MU69, the contact\nvelocity should be 3.3-4.2 m/s, in line with the observational evidence from\nthe lack of deformation features and estimate of the tensile strength.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 2020 05:33:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Nov 2020 19:59:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-30"}

Several forms of electromagnetic\npropulsion have been researched and developed, such as the Variable Specific\nImpulse Magnetoplasma Rocket, pulsed inductive thrusters, and the electrodeless\nplasma thruster.

The absence of bulk coexistence of magnetism and\nsuperconductivity and a nanoscale separation into low-doping-like and\nhigh-doping-like regions have been confirmed. Additional frequency dependent\nintensity, spin-spin, and spin-lattice relaxation rate measurements on\nunderdoped samples at the boundary of magnetism and superconductivity indicate\nthat orthorhombicity and magnetism originate from the low-doping-like regions,\nand superconductivity develops at first in the high-doping-like regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 2020 09:45:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-03"}

On-surface reactions of\nrationally-designed precursor molecules on Au(111) lead to the selective\nformation of triangulene dimers in which the triangulene units are either\ndirectly connected through their minority sublattice atoms, or are separated\nvia a 1,4-phenylene spacer.

This paper describes a Bayesian\nnonparametric approach that leverages continuous (i.e., Gaussian processes) and\ndiscrete (i.e., Dirichlet processes) stochastic processes to reveal underlying\ninteraction patterns of the ego vehicle with other nearby vehicles. Our model\nrelaxes dependency on the number of surrounding vehicles by developing an\nacceleration-sensitive velocity field based on Gaussian processes.

In joint\nunsupervised training of depth and pose, we can segment the occluded region\nexplicitly. The occlusion information is used in unsupervised learning of\ndepth, pose and optical flow, as the image reconstructed by depth-pose and\noptical flow will be invalid in occluded regions.

An intuitive way to represent the (in)compatibility\nrelations among a set of measurements is via a hypergraph representing their\njoint measurability structure: its vertices represent measurements and its\nhyperedges represent (all and only) subsets of compatible measurements.\nProjective measurements in quantum theory realize (all and only) joint\nmeasurability structures that are graphs.

These results are compared to ZnO\npolariton lasers and to ZnO random lasers. We interpret the peaks of the\nexciton-polariton lifetimes in our results as a sign of gain narrowing which\nmay lead to stable polariton lasing modes in the single excited ZnO Mie\nresonator. This form of gain may lead to polariton random lasing in an ensemble\nof ZnO Mie resonators in the non-equilibrium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 2020 12:11:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 7 Mar 2020 08:49:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-10"}

A fair blockchain is expected to have healthy metrics; high\nhonest mining power, low processing latency, i.e., low wait times for\ntransactions and stable price of consumption, i.e., the minimum transaction fee\nrequired to have a transaction processed. As Bitcoin matures, the influx of\ntransactions increases and the block rewards become insignificant. We show that\nunder these conditions, it becomes hard to maintain the health of the\nblockchain. In Bitcoin, under these mature operating conditions (MOC), the\nminers would find it challenging to cover their mining costs as there would be\nno more revenue from merely mining a block. It may cause miners not to continue\nmining, threatening the blockchain's security. Further, as we show in this\npaper using simulations, the cost of acting in favor of the health of the\nblockchain, under MOC, is very high in Bitcoin, causing all miners to process\ntransactions greedily. It leads to stranded transactions, i.e., transactions\noffering low transaction fees, experiencing unreasonably high processing\nlatency. To make matters worse, a compounding effect of these stranded\ntransactions is the rising price of consumption. Such phenomena not only induce\nunfairness as experienced by the miners and the users but also deteriorate the\nhealth of the blockchain.\n  We propose BitcoinF transaction processing protocol, a simple, yet highly\neffective modification to the existing Bitcoin protocol to fix these issues of\nunfairness. BitcoinF resolves these issues of unfairness while preserving the\nability of the users to express urgency and have their transactions\nprioritized.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 2020 12:37:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-03"}

Each agent possesses a time-varying local\nobjective function, and all agents aim to collaboratively track the drifting\nglobal optimal solution that minimizes the summation of all local objective\nfunctions. The decentralized dynamic optimization problem can be solved by\nprimal or primal-dual methods, and when the problem degenerates to be static,\nit has been proved in literature that primal-dual methods are superior to\nprimal ones. This motivates us to ask: are primal-dual methods necessarily\nbetter than primal ones in decentralized dynamic optimization?\n  To answer this question, we investigate and compare convergence properties of\nthe primal method, diffusion, and the primal-dual approach, decentralized\ngradient tracking (DGT). Theoretical analysis reveals that diffusion can\noutperform DGT in certain dynamic settings. We find that DGT and diffusion are\nsignificantly affected by the drifts and the magnitudes of optimal gradients,\nrespectively. In addition, we show that DGT is more sensitive to the network\ntopology, and a badly-connected network can greatly deteriorate its convergence\nperformance. These conclusions provide guidelines on how to choose proper\ndynamic algorithms in various application scenarios.

Most traditional distributed learning methods typically\nassume no failure or attack. However, many unexpected cases, such as\ncommunication failure and even malicious attack, may happen in real\napplications. Hence, Byzantine learning (BL), which refers to distributed\nlearning with failure or attack, has recently attracted much attention. Most\nexisting BL methods are synchronous, which are impractical in some applications\ndue to heterogeneous or offline workers. In these cases, asynchronous BL (ABL)\nis usually preferred. In this paper, we propose a novel method, called buffered\nasynchronous stochastic gradient descent (BASGD), for ABL. To the best of our\nknowledge, BASGD is the first ABL method that can resist non-omniscient attacks\nwithout storing any instances on server. Furthermore, we also propose an\nimproved variant of BASGD, called BASGD with momentum (BASGDm), by introducing\nmomentum into BASGD. BASGDm can resist both non-omniscient and omniscient\nattacks. Compared with those methods which need to store instances on server,\nBASGD and BASGDm have a wider scope of application. Both BASGD and BASGDm are\ncompatible with various aggregation rules.

However,\nreal-time recognition of dynamic micro hand gestures from video streams is\nchallenging for in-vehicle scenarios since (i) the gestures should be performed\nnaturally without distracting the driver, (ii) micro hand gestures occur within\nvery short time intervals at spatially constrained areas, (iii) the performed\ngesture should be recognized only once, and (iv) the entire architecture should\nbe designed lightweight as it will be deployed to an embedded system. In this\nwork, we propose an HCI system for dynamic recognition of driver micro hand\ngestures, which can have a crucial impact in automotive sector especially for\nsafety related issues. For this purpose, we initially collected a dataset named\nDriver Micro Hand Gestures (DriverMHG), which consists of RGB, depth and\ninfrared modalities. The challenges for dynamic recognition of micro hand\ngestures have been addressed by proposing a lightweight convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN) based architecture which operates online efficiently with a\nsliding window approach. For the CNN model, several 3-dimensional resource\nefficient networks are applied and their performances are analyzed. Online\nrecognition of gestures has been performed with 3D-MobileNetV2, which provided\nthe best offline accuracy among the applied networks with similar computational\ncomplexities. The final architecture is deployed on a driver simulator\noperating in real-time. We make DriverMHG dataset and our source code publicly\navailable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 2020 14:54:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 2021 13:38:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-20"}

In the presence of non-linearities, depending on the spectral\ncomponents of the power supply noise and the nature of the source, such a\nmechanism can increase the diffusion of the particles in the distribution\nthrough the excitation of sideband resonances in the vicinity of the ones\ndriven by the lattice non-linearities. For the HL-LHC, due to the reduction of\nthe beam size in the Interaction Points (IP) of the high luminosity experiments\n(IP1 and 5), increased sensitivity to noise effects is anticipated for the\nquadrupoles of the inner triplets. The modulation that may arise from the power\nsupply ripples will be combined with the tune modulation that intrinsically\nemerges from the coupling of the transverse and longitudinal plane for\noff-momentum particles through chromaticity. To this end, the aim of this paper\nis to study the impact of tune modulation effects on the transverse beam motion\nresulting from the interplay between quadrupolar power supply ripples and\nsynchro-betatron coupling. A power supply noise threshold for acceptable\nperformance is estimated with single-particle tracking simulations by\ninvestigating the impact of different modulation frequencies and amplitudes on\nthe Dynamic Aperture. The excitation of sideband resonances due to the\nmodulation is demonstrated with frequency maps and the higher sensitivity to\nspecific modulation frequencies is explained.

To assess this\nimpact, we apply interrupted time series models to measure whether different\ntypes of YouTube sharing in Twitter and Reddit changed significantly in the\neight months around YouTube's announcement. We evaluate video sharing across\nthree curated sets of potentially harmful, anti-social content: a set of\nconspiracy videos that have been shown to experience reduced recommendations in\nYouTube, a larger set of videos posted by conspiracy-oriented channels, and a\nset of videos posted by alternative influence network (AIN) channels.

Using descriptions based on the simple exclusion process, two\npopulations of particles, mimicking pedestrians walking in a built environment,\nenter a room from two opposite sides. One population is passive -- being\nunaware of the local environment; particles belonging to this group perform a\nsymmetric random walk. The other population has information on the local\ngeometry in the sense that as soon as particles enter a visibility zone, a\ndrift activates them. Their self-propulsion leads them towards the exit. This\nsecond type of species is referred here as active. The assumed crowdedness\ncorresponds to a near--jammed scenario. The main question we ask in this paper\nis: Can we induce modifications of the dynamics of the active particles to\nimprove the outgoing current of the passive particles?

The main idea is\nto select Lefschetz thimbles as the cycle approaching the critical point at the\npath-integration, where the imaginary part of the complex action stays\nconstant. Since the imaginary part of the action is constant on each thimble,\nthe sign problem disappears and the integral can be calculated much more\neffectively.

Because we\nassume that post-merger cold gas onto large black holes produces either a radio\nloud or a radio quiet quasar, we show that for largest black hole masses that\nlive in largest dark matter halos, fRLQ approaches 0.5 from below but does not\nexceed it, such that in rich clusters the formation of a radio loud quasar\ntends to be equally likely to occur as a radio quiet quasar. In dark matter\nhalos with smaller mass, by contrast, radio quiet quasars are more likely to\nform and the likelihood increases inversely with dark matter halo mass. As a\nresult, averaging over a population of radio loud and radio quiet quasars will\nnecessarily generate lower average black hole masses for the radio quiet\nsubgroup. Hence, despite the fact that the formation of radio quiet quasars is\npreferred over radio loud quasars in any environment, at any mass scale, at any\nluminosity, or redshift, averaging over a range of radio loud quasars will give\nthe appearance they are preferred in cluster environments over radio quiet\nquasars.

It is found that the entanglement\nbehaviors are dependent on vacuum fluctuation, spacetime topology, two-atom\nseparation and atomic polarization orientation. After a long time of evolution,\nentanglement would vanish, which means entanglement affected by electromagnetic\nfluctuation can not maintain for a long time. For different spacetime\ntopologies, entanglement presents different behaviors dependent on various\nparameters. When deficit angle parameter $\\nu=1$ and atom-string distance is\ntowards infinity, the results in flat spacetime are recovered. When atoms keep\nclose to the string, entanglement can be improved; specially, when two atoms\nlocate on the string and have no polarization of axial direction, atoms are not\naffected by the electromagnetic fluctuation and entanglement can remain\nunchanged. When two-atom separation is relatively large, entanglement exhibits\noscillation behavior as atom-string distance varies. This indicates that the\nexistence of string profoundly modifies on the vacuum fluctuation and\natom-field interaction. In addition, when two-atom separation is small,\nentanglement gains better improvement. Many parameters and conditions provide\nus with greater freedom to control the entanglement behaviors.

This could\nhappen due to the nature of certain dependencies or lack of patterns that lend\nthem difficult to be modeled globally using multi-head self-attention. In this\nwork, we propose a new way of learning dependencies through a context in\nmulti-head using convolution. This new form of multi-head attention along with\nthe traditional form achieves better results than Transformer on the WMT 2014\nEnglish-to-German and English-to-French translation tasks. We also introduce a\nframework to learn POS tagging and NER information during the training of\nencoder which further improves results achieving a new state-of-the-art of 32.1\nBLEU, better than existing best by 1.4 BLEU, on the WMT 2014 English-to-German\nand 44.6 BLEU, better than existing best by 1.1 BLEU, on the WMT 2014\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks. We call this Transformer++.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 2020 13:00:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-02"}

In particular, these systems that carry confidential information are\nsubject to security attacks. Accordingly, an Intrusion Detection System (IDS)\nhas been proposed in the proposed design to protect against the security\nproblems using the human immune system (HIS). The IDSs are used to detect and\nrespond to attempts to compromise the target system. Since the UASs operate in\nthe real world, the testing and validation of these systems with a variety of\nsensors is confronted with problems. This design is inspired by HIS. In the\nmapping, insecure signals are equivalent to an antigen that are detected by\nantibody-based training patterns and removed from the operation cycle. Among\nthe main uses of the proposed design are the quick detection of intrusive\nsignals and quarantining their activity. Moreover, SUAS-HIS method is evaluated\nhere via extensive simulations carried out in NS-3 environment. The simulation\nresults indicate that the UAS network performance metrics are improved in terms\nof false positive rate, false negative rate, detection rate, and packet\ndelivery rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Mar 2020 19:05:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-12"}

While most\nresearch to infer model behavior has focused on indirect strategies that\nestimate prediction uncertainties and visualize model support in the input\nimage space, the ability to explicitly query a prediction model regarding its\nimage content offers a more direct way to determine the behavior of trained\nmodels. To this end, we present a novel Visual Question Answering approach that\nallows an image to be queried by means of a written question. Experiments on a\nvariety of medical and natural image datasets show that by fusing image and\nquestion features in a novel way, the proposed approach achieves an equal or\nhigher accuracy compared to current methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 2020 10:16:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-23"}
