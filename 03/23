The coupling between two\ntype-II layers prefers the antiferromagnetic (AFM) order, while type-I and\ntype-II interfaces favor the ferromagnetic (FM) way. However, for two type-I\nlayers, they display competition between FM and AFM orders and even lead to the\nstacking dependent magnetism.

Therefore, this rule provides simple guidance to understand the\ninterlayer exchange and further design van der Waals junctions with desired\nmagnetic orders.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Mar 2020 16:41:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2020 19:25:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-04"}

Furthermore, we\nincorporate this geometric approach into an iterative framework and illustrate\nits capability to derive feasible controls for steering bilinear ensemble\nsystems. We conduct various numerical experiments on the control of linear and\nbilinear ensembles to validate the theoretical developments and demonstrate the\napplicability of the proposed convex-geometric approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Mar 2020 20:25:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-24"}

We consider the problem of private polynomial computation (PPC). In\nPPC, a user wishes to compute a multivariate polynomial of degree at most $g$\nover $f$ variables (or messages) stored in multiple databases. First, we\nconsider the private computation of polynomials of degree $g=1$, i.e., private\nlinear computation (PLC) for coded databases. In PLC, a user wishes to compute\na linear combination over the $f$ messages while keeping the coefficients of\nthe desired linear combination hidden from the database. For a linearly encoded\nDSS, we present a capacity-achieving PLC scheme and show that the PLC capacity,\nwhich is the ratio of the desired amount of information and the total amount of\ndownloaded information, matches the maximum distance separable coded capacity\nof PIR for a large class of linear storage codes. Then, we consider private\ncomputation of higher degree polynomials, i.e., $g>1$. For this setup, we\nconstruct two novel PPC schemes. In the first scheme, we consider Reed-Solomon\ncoded databases with Lagrange encoding, which leverages ideas from recently\nproposed star-product PIR and Lagrange coded computation. The second scheme\nconsiders the special case of coded databases with systematic Lagrange\nencoding. Both schemes yield improved rates, while asymptotically, as\n$f\\rightarrow \\infty$, the systematic scheme gives a significantly better\ncomputation retrieval rate compared to all known schemes up to some storage\ncode rate that depends on the maximum degree of the candidate polynomials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Mar 2020 22:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Aug 2021 20:21:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-06"}

For many\ntechniques, the whole audio sequence to be decoded needs to be available at the\nstart of the processing, e.g., for the attention mechanism or the bidirectional\nLSTM (BLSTM). In this paper, we propose several techniques to mitigate these\nproblems. We introduce an additional loss function controlling the uncertainty\nof the attention mechanism, a modified beam search identifying partial, stable\nhypotheses, ways of working with BLSTM in the encoder, and the use of chunked\nBLSTM.

Research on traditional fundus\nimages is an active topic but studies on UWF fundus images are few. One of the\nmost important reasons is that UWF fundus images are hard to obtain. In this\npaper, for the first time, we explore domain adaptation from the traditional\nfundus to UWF fundus images.

In this study, I applied an adapted SIR\nmodel previously used in South Korea to model the MERS outbreak, which is also\ncaused by a coronavirus, to estimate the evolution of the curve of active cases\nin the case of the Portuguese situation, using Italian dara. I then construct\nfive different scenarios for the evolution of covid-19 in Portugal. In the out\nof control scenario, the number of active cases could reach as much as ~40,000\npeople on the 5th of April (out-of-control scenario). If the self-protective\nand control are taken in the same level as what was considered for the South\nKorean model, this number could have be reduced to about 800 cases (scenario\n1). Considering that this scenario is now unrealistic, three other scenarios\nwere devised. In all these scenarios, the government measures had a 50\\%\neffectiveness when compared to the measures in Korea. But in scenario 2 the\ntransmission rate $\\beta$ was effectively reduced to 50\\%, In this scenario\nactive cases could reach circa 7,000 people.

This study shows the importance of control and self-protecting\nmeasure to bring down the number of affected people by following the\nrecommendations of the WHO and health authorities.

Catering for emerging business requirements, a new\narchitecture called execute-order-validate has been proposed in Hyperledger\nFabric to support parallel transactions and improve the blockchain's\nthroughput. However, this new architecture might render many invalid\ntransactions when serializing them. This problem is further exaggerated as the\nblock formation rate is inherently limited due to other factors beside data\nprocessing, such as cryptography and consensus.\n  In this work, we propose a novel method to enhance the execute-order-validate\narchitecture, by reducing invalid transactions to improve the throughput of\nblockchains.

In contrast to existing\nblockchains that adopt database's preventive approaches which might abort\nserializable transactions, our method is theoretically more fine-grained.\nSpecifically, unserializable transactions are aborted before ordering and the\nremaining transactions are guaranteed to be serializable. For evaluation, we\nimplement our method in two blockchains respectively, FabricSharp on top of\nHyperledger Fabric, and FastFabricSharp on top of FastFabric. We compare the\nperformance of FabricSharp with vanilla Fabric and three related systems, two\nof which are respectively implemented with one standard and one\nstate-of-the-art concurrency control techniques from databases.

To ensure the\n\"new\" requirement of data privacy, existing decentralized HITs use generic\nzero-knowledge proof frameworks (e.g. SNARK), but scarcely perform well in\npractice, due to the inherently expensive cost of generality.\n  We present a practical decentralized protocol for HITs, which also achieves\nthe fairness between requesters and workers. At the core of our contributions,\nwe avoid the powerful yet highly-costly generic zk-proof tools and propose a\nspecial-purpose scheme to prove the quality of encrypted data.

Large-eddy simulations (LES) and\ndynamic modal decomposition (DMD) of the supersonic cavity flow reveal the\ndominance of two-dimensional Rossiter modes II and IV. These predominantly\ntwo-dimensional vortical structures generate high-amplitude unsteadiness over\nthe cavity through trailing-edge impingement and create oblique shock waves by\nobstructing the freestream. To disrupt the undesired formation of vortical\nstructures, we introduce three-dimensional unsteady forcing along the cavity\nleading edge to generate streamwise vortical structures. Resolvent analysis\nwith respect to the time-averaged base flow is leveraged to determine the\noptimal combination of forcing frequency and spanwise wavenumber. Instead of\nselecting the most amplified resolvent forcing modes, we seek the combination\nof control parameters that yields sustained amplification of the primary\nresolvent-based kinetic energy distribution over the entire length of the\ncavity. The sustained amplification is critical to ensure that the selected\nforcing input remains effective to prevent the formation of the large spanwise\nvortices. This resolvent-analysis-based flow control guideline is validated\nwith a number of companion LES of the controlled cavity flows. The optimal\ncontrol setup is verified to be the most effective in reducing the pressure\nroot-mean-square level up to 52% along the aft and bottom cavity walls compared\nto the baseline cavity flow. The present flow control guideline derived from\nresolvent analysis should be applicable to flows that require the actuation\ninput to remain effective over an extended region of interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Mar 2020 06:07:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-01"}

By using a\nhigh resolution spectral scan through a temperature controlled variation of the\nbandgap of the WS2 sandwich layer, we obtain a gate voltage dependent vertical\nphotocurrent strongly relying on the spectral position of the excitation, and\nthe photocurrent maximizes when the excitation energy is resonant with the\ntrion peak position. Further, the resonant photocurrent thus generated can be\neffectively controlled by a back gate voltage applied through the incomplete\nscreening of the bottom monolayer graphene, and the photocurrent strongly\ncorrelates with the gate dependent trion intensity, while the non-resonant\nphotocurrent exhibits only a weak gate dependence -unambiguously proving a\ntrion driven photocurrent generation under resonance.

First, we investigate a sonic point of a transonic steady\nperfect fluid flow in a general stationary spacetime, particularly focusing on\nthe radiation fluid. The necessary conditions that the flow must satisfy at a\nsonic point are derived as conditions for the kinematical quantities of the\ncongruence of streamlines in analogy with the de Laval nozzle equation in fluid\nmechanics. We compare the conditions for a sonic point with the notion of a\nphoton surface, which can be defined as a timelike totally umbilical\nhypersurface. As a result, we find that, for the realization of the sonic\npoint/photon surface correspondence, the speed of sound $v_{\\rm s}$ must be\ngiven by $1/\\sqrt{d}$ with $d$ being the spatial dimension of the spacetime.\nFor the radiation fluid ($v_{\\rm s}=1/\\sqrt{d}$), we confirm that a part of the\nconditions is shared by the sonic point and the photon surface. However, in\ngeneral, a Bondi surface, a set of sonic points, does not necessarily coincide\nwith a photon surface. Additional assumptions, such as a spatial symmetry, are\nessential to the realization of the sonic point/photon surface correspondence\nin all known examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Mar 2020 08:23:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-09"}

A straightforward method, not requiring any hyper-parameter\nfine-tuning, useful when the low dimensionality does not warrant a MC-EM.

We prove that the tempered EM\nverifies the convergence guarantees for a wider range of temperature profiles\nthan previously considered.

Recently, many deep learning\nmethods have been developed for segmentation of BUS image and show some\nadvantages compared with conventional region-, model-, and traditional\nlearning-based methods. However, previous deep learning methods typically use\nskip-connection to concatenate the encoder and decoder, which might not make\nfull fusion of coarse-to-fine features from encoder and decoder. Since the\nstructure and edge of lesion in BUS image are common blurred, these would make\nit difficult to learn the discriminant information of structure and edge, and\nreduce the performance. To this end, we propose and evaluate a coarse-to-fine\nfusion convolutional network (CF2-Net) based on a novel feature integration\nstrategy (forming an 'E'-like type) for BUS image segmentation. To enhance\ncontour and provide structural information, we concatenate a super-pixel image\nand the original image as the input of CF2-Net. Meanwhile, to highlight the\ndifferences in the lesion regions with variable sizes and relieve the imbalance\nissue, we further design a weighted-balanced loss function to train the CF2-Net\neffectively.

However, a\nwell established measure of RNNs long-term memory capacity is lacking, and thus\nformal understanding of the effect of depth on their ability to correlate data\nthroughout time is limited. Specifically, existing depth efficiency results on\nconvolutional networks do not suffice in order to account for the success of\ndeep RNNs on data of varying lengths. In order to address this, we introduce a\nmeasure of the network's ability to support information flow across time,\nreferred to as the Start-End separation rank, which reflects the distance of\nthe function realized by the recurrent network from modeling no dependency\nbetween the beginning and end of the input sequence. We prove that deep\nrecurrent networks support Start-End separation ranks which are combinatorially\nhigher than those supported by their shallow counterparts. Thus, we establish\nthat depth brings forth an overwhelming advantage in the ability of recurrent\nnetworks to model long-term dependencies, and provide an exemplar of\nquantifying this key attribute. We empirically demonstrate the discussed\nphenomena on common RNNs through extensive experimental evaluation using the\noptimization technique of restricting the hidden-to-hidden matrix to being\northogonal. Finally, we employ the tool of quantum Tensor Networks to gain\nadditional graphic insights regarding the complexity brought forth by depth in\nrecurrent networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Mar 2020 10:29:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-24"}

Currently, deep Bayesian neural networks and sparse Gaussian\nprocesses are the main two scalable uncertainty estimation methods. However,\ndeep Bayesian neural network suffers from lack of expressiveness, and more\nexpressive models such as deep kernel learning, which is an extension of sparse\nGaussian process, captures only the uncertainty from the higher level latent\nspace. Therefore, the deep learning model under it lacks interpretability and\nignores uncertainty from the raw data.

We compare ConFiG to the state-of-the-art approach based on\npacking fibres together by generating phantoms in a range of fibre\nconfigurations including crossing fibre bundles and orientation dispersion.\nResults demonstrate that ConFiG produces phantoms with up to 20% higher\ndensities than the state-of-the-art, particularly in complex configurations\nwith crossing fibres.

Indeed, naive crossover leads to\nfunctionally damaged offspring that do not retain information from the parents.\nThis is because neural networks are invariant to permutations of neurons,\ngiving rise to multiple ways of representing the same solution. This is often\nreferred to as the competing conventions problem. In this paper, we propose a\ntwo-step safe crossover(SC) operator. First, the neurons of the parents are\nfunctionally aligned by computing how well they correlate, and only then are\nthe parents recombined. We compare two ways of measuring relationships between\nneurons: Pairwise Correlation (PwC) and Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA).\nWe test our safe crossover operators (SC-PwC and SC-CCA) on MNIST and CIFAR-10\nby performing arithmetic crossover on the weights of feed-forward neural\nnetwork pairs. We show that it effectively transmits information from parents\nto offspring and significantly improves upon naive crossover. Our method is\ncomputationally fast,can serve as a way to explore the fitness landscape more\nefficiently and makes safe crossover a potentially promising operator in future\nneuroevolution research and applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Mar 2020 14:50:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 2020 23:00:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 4 May 2020 07:58:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-17"}

Even for the planets\nin the Solar System, difficulties in observation lead to large uncertainties in\nthe properties of planetary cores. Exoplanets that have undergone rare\nevolutionary processes provide a route to understanding planetary interiors.\nPlanets found in and near the typically barren hot-Neptune 'desert' (a region\nin mass-radius space that contains few planets) have proved to be particularly\nvaluable in this regard. These planets include HD149026b, which is thought to\nhave an unusually massive core, and recent discoveries such as LTT9779b and\nNGTS-4b, on which photoevaporation has removed a substantial part of their\nouter atmospheres. Here we report observations of the planet TOI-849b, which\nhas a radius smaller than Neptune's but an anomalously large mass of\n$39.1^{+2.7}_{-2.6}$ Earth masses and a density of $5.2^{+0.7}_{-0.8}$ grams\nper cubic centimetre, similar to Earth's. Interior structure models suggest\nthat any gaseous envelope of pure hydrogen and helium consists of no more than\n$3.9^{+0.8}_{-0.9}$ per cent of the total planetary mass. The planet could have\nbeen a gas giant before undergoing extreme mass loss via thermal\nself-disruption or giant planet collisions, or it could have avoided\nsubstantial gas accretion, perhaps through gap opening or late formation.\nAlthough photoevaporation rates cannot account for the mass loss required to\nreduce a Jupiter-like gas giant, they can remove a small (a few Earth masses)\nhydrogen and helium envelope on timescales of several billion years, implying\nthat any remaining atmosphere on TOI-849b is likely to be enriched by water or\nother volatiles from the planetary interior. We conclude that TOI-849b is the\nremnant core of a giant planet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Mar 2020 15:04:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Jul 2020 10:13:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2020 13:10:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-17"}

After\nconducting the necessary pre-processing analyses, the PPL and XPL images as\nwell as their comprehensive image (CI) were incorporated in three convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs) comprising the same structure for achieving a\npreliminary classification; these images were developed by employing the fused\nprincipal component analysis (PCA).

In most data sets, fraud occurs in typically less than 0.5% of the\ncases. Detecting fraud in such a highly imbalanced data set typically leads to\npredictions that favor the majority group, causing fraud to remain undetected.\nWe discuss some popular oversampling techniques that solve the problem of\nimbalanced data by creating synthetic samples that mimic the minority class. A\nfrequent problem when analyzing real data is the presence of anomalies or\noutliers. When such atypical observations are present in the data, most\noversampling techniques are prone to create synthetic samples that distort the\ndetection algorithm and spoil the resulting analysis. A useful tool for anomaly\ndetection is robust statistics, which aims to find the outliers by first\nfitting the majority of the data and then flagging data observations that\ndeviate from it. In this paper, we present a robust version of ROSE, called\nrobROSE, which combines several promising approaches to cope simultaneously\nwith the problem of imbalanced data and the presence of outliers. The proposed\nmethod achieves to enhance the presence of the fraud cases while ignoring\nanomalies. The good performance of our new sampling technique is illustrated on\nsimulated and real data sets and it is shown that robROSE can provide better\ninsight in the structure of the data.

Specifically, given a data set that can be\nconsidered as an unorganized data point set in high-dimensional space, a\ndiscrete LBO defined on the big data set is constructed and its eigenvalues and\neigenvectors are calculated. Then, the local extremum and the saddle points of\nthe eigenfunctions are proposed to be the feature points of a data set in\nhigh-dimensional space, constituting a simplified data set. Moreover, we\ndevelop feature point detection methods for the functions defined on an\nunorganized data point set in high-dimensional space, and devise metrics for\nmeasuring the fidelity of the simplified data set to the original set. Finally,\nexamples and applications are demonstrated to validate the efficiency and\neffectiveness of the proposed methods, demonstrating that data set\nsimplification is a method for processing a maximum-sized data set using a\nlimited data processing capability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Mar 2020 13:52:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-07"}

When mentors are unavailable, a fallback autonomous mechanism should\nprovide medical practitioners with the required guidance. However,\nAI/autonomous mentoring in medicine has been limited by the availability of\ngeneralizable prediction models, and surgical procedures datasets to train\nthose models with. This work presents the initial steps towards the development\nof an intelligent artificial system for autonomous medical mentoring.\nSpecifically, we present the first Database for AI Surgical Instruction\n(DAISI).

According to the BLEU\nscores, the predicted and ground truth instructions were as high as 67%\nsimilar. Additionally, expert physicians subjectively assessed the algorithm\nusing Likert scale, and considered that the predicted descriptions were related\nto the images.

Many, if not all, existing\nstudies formulate this as a bus frequency optimization problem which tries to\nminimize passengers' average waiting time. However, many investigations have\nconfirmed that the user satisfaction drops faster as the waiting time\nincreases. Consequently, this paper studies the bus frequency optimization\nproblem considering the user satisfaction. Specifically, for the first time to\nour best knowledge, we study how to schedule the buses such that the total\nnumber of passengers who could receive their bus services within the waiting\ntime threshold is maximized. We prove that this problem is NP-hard, and present\nan index-based algorithm with $(1-1/e)$ approximation ratio. By exploiting the\nlocality property of routes in a bus network, we propose a partition-based\ngreedy method which achieves a $(1-\\rho)(1-1/e)$ approximation ratio. Then we\npropose a progressive partition-based greedy method to further improve the\nefficiency while achieving a $(1-\\rho)(1-1/e-\\varepsilon)$ approximation ratio.\nExperiments on a real city-wide bus dataset in Singapore verify the efficiency,\neffectiveness, and scalability of our methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Mar 2020 15:39:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-30"}

A process tree is\na tree-based model of a process, in which internal vertices represent\nbehavioral control-flow relations and leaves represent process activities. A\nprocess tree is easily translated into a sound Workflow net (WF-net), however,\nthe reverse is not the case. Yet, an algorithm that translates a WF-net into a\nprocess tree is of great interest, e.g., the explicit knowledge of the\ncontrol-flow hierarchy in a WF-net allows one to more easily reason on its\nbehavior. Hence, in this paper, we present such an algorithm, i.e., it detects\nwhether a WF-net corresponds to a process tree, and, if so, constructs it. We\nprove that, if a process tree is discovered, the language of the process tree\nequals the language of the original WF-net. Conducted experiments show, that\nthe algorithm's corresponding implementation has a quadratic time-complexity in\nthe size of the WF-net. Furthermore, the experiments show strong evidence of\nprocess tree rediscoverability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Mar 2020 10:56:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-04"}

However, there are challenges to slow down the DNA\ntranslocation process to achieve a single nucleobase resolution. A series of\ncomputational tools have been used in an attempt to study the DNA\ntranslocations in several model systems. The prospect of finding an efficient\nnanoelectrode for such human genome sequencing might offer an entirely\ninnovative way of preventive health care. Here, we have studied the performance\nof a boron carbide BC$_3$ based nanogap setup for DNA sequencing using the\ndensity functional theory and non equilibrium Greens function-based methods.\nThe electric current variations under different applied bias voltages are found\nto be significant due to changes in the nucleotides orientation and lateral\nposition and can even outperform graphene. Computed relatively lower\ninteraction energy for BC$_3$ electrodes compared to graphene electrodes\nindicates that BC$_3$ is a better nanoelectrode for DNA sequencing. From our\nresults, we have found that the unique identification of all four nucleotides\npossible in the 0.3 to 0.4 V bias region. Furthermore, each of the four\nnucleotides exhibits around one order of current difference, which makes it\npossible to identify all four nucleotides uniquely.
