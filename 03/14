A signature of this anomalous localization\nis the square root dependence of the logarithmic average of the conductance on\nthe system length, in contrast to the linear length dependence for Anderson\nlocalized systems. We study the effect of a time-periodic external field in the\nscaling and distribution of the conductance of a quantum wire with hopping\ndisorder. In the low-frequency regime, we show a transition between anomalous\nlocalization and Anderson localization as a function of the parameters of the\nexternal field. The Floquet modes mix different energy contributions and\nstandard length dependence of the logarithmic average of the conductance is\ngradually recovered as we lower the frequency or increase the amplitude of the\nexternal field. In the high-frequency regime, the system presents still\nanomalous localization but the conductance is also renormalized, depending on\nthe parameters of the external field, by interference effects at the coupling\nto the leads. This allows for a high degree of control of the average of the\nconductance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Mar 2020 16:33:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-20"}

Here I describe two early\nmodified gravity mechanisms that reconcile the value of $H_0$ by increasing the\nexpansion rate in the era of matter-radiation equality. These mechanisms, based\non viable Horndeski theories, require significantly less fine-tuned initial\nconditions than early dark energy with oscillating scalar fields. In Imperfect\nDark Energy at Equality (IDEE), the initial energy density dilutes slower than\nradiation but faster than matter, naturally peaking around the era of equality.\nThe minimal IDEE model, a cubic Galileon, is too constrained by the cosmic\nmicrowave background (Planck) and baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) to relieve\nthe $H_0$ tension. In Enhanced Early Gravity (EEG), the scalar field value\nmodulates the cosmological strength of gravity. The minimal EEG model, an\nexponentially coupled cubic Galileon, gives a Planck+BAO value $H_0=68.7 \\pm\n1.5$ (68\\% c.l.), reducing the tension with SH0ES from $4.4\\sigma$ to\n$2.6\\sigma$. Additionally, Galileon contributions to cosmic acceleration may\nreconcile $H_0$ via Late-Universe Phantom Expansion (LUPE). Combining LUPE, EEG\nand $\\Lambda$ reduces the tension between Planck, BAO and SH0ES to $2.5\\sigma$.\nI will also describe additional tests of coupled Galileons based on local\ngravity tests, primordial element abundances and gravitational waves.

Unfortunately, state-of-the-art VC\nmodeling methods require computationally prohibitive parameter tuning or make\nrestrictive assumptions about the functional form of the covariate effects.\n  In response, we propose VCBART, which estimates the covariate effects in a VC\nmodel using Bayesian Additive Regression Trees.

One key point to obtain good performance for the lip reading task\ndepends heavily on how effective the representation can be to capture the lip\nmovement information and meanwhile to resist the noises resulted from the\nchange of pose, lighting conditions, speaker's appearance and so on. Towards\nthis target, we propose to introduce the mutual information constraints on both\nthe local feature's level and the global sequence's level to enhance the\nrelations of the features with the speech content. On the one hand, we\nconstraint the features generated at each time step to enable them carry a\nstrong relation with the speech content by imposing the local mutual\ninformation maximization constraint (LMIM), leading to improvements over the\nmodel's ability to discover fine-grained lip movements and the fine-grained\ndifferences among words with similar pronunciation, such as ``spend'' and\n``spending''. On the other hand, we introduce the mutual information\nmaximization constraint on the global sequence's level (GMIM), to make the\nmodel be able to pay more attention to discriminate key frames related with the\nspeech content, and less to various noises appeared in the speaking process. By\ncombining these two advantages together, the proposed method is expected to be\nboth discriminative and robust for effective lip reading. To verify this\nmethod, we evaluate on two large-scale benchmark. We perform a detailed\nanalysis and comparison on several aspects, including the comparison of the\nLMIM and GMIM with the baseline, the visualization of the learned\nrepresentation and so on. The results not only prove the effectiveness of the\nproposed method but also report new state-of-the-art performance on both the\ntwo benchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 13 Mar 2020 18:47:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-17"}

We present a simulation approach that models ultrasound propagation\nin the human brain while it is moving due to the complex shear shock wave\ndeformation from a traumatic impact. Finite difference simulations can model\nultrasound propagation in complex media such as human tissue. Recently, we have\nshown that a finite difference approach can be used to represent displacements\nthat are much smaller than the grid size, such as the motion encountered in\nshear wave propagation from ultrasound elastography. However, this\nsubresolution displacement model, called impedance flow, was only implemented\nand validated for acoustical media composed of randomly distributed scatterers.\nHere we propose a generalization of the impedance flow method that describes\nthe continuous subresolution motion of structured acoustical maps, and in\nparticular of acoustical maps of the human brain. It is shown that the average\nerror in the subresolution displacement method is small compared to the\nwavelength. The method is applied to acoustical maps of a moving human brain,\nimposed by the propagation of a shear shock wave. Then the Fullwave simulation\ntool is used to model transmit-receive imaging sequences based on an L7-4\nimaging transducer. The simulated radiofrequency data is beamformed using a\nconventional delay-and-sum method and a normalized cross-correlation method\ndesigned for shock wave tracking is used to determine the tissue motion. It is\nshown that the proposed generalized impedance flow method accurately captures\nthe shear shock wave motion.

However, performing inference of DNNs in the edge is still a severe\nchallenge, mainly because of the contradiction between the intensive resource\nrequirements of DNNs and the tight resource availability in several edge\ndomains. Further, as communication is costly, taking advantage of other\navailable edge devices by using data- or model-parallelism methods is not an\neffective solution. To benefit from available compute resources with low\ncommunication overhead, we propose the first DNN parallelization method for\nreducing the communication overhead in a distributed system.

In the proposed method, a CAV platoon is\nfirstly discretized into a grid system, where a CAV moves from one cell to\nanother in the discrete time-space domain. Then, the cooperative sorting\nproblem is modeled as a path-finding problem in the graphic domain. The problem\nis solved by the deterministic Astar algorithm with a stepwise strategy, where\nonly one vehicle can move within a movement step. The resultant shortest path\nis further optimized with an integer linear programming algorithm to minimize\nthe sorting time by allowing multiple movements within a step. To improve the\nalgorithm running time and address multiple shortest paths, a distributed\nstochastic Astar algorithm (DSA) is developed by introducing random\ndisturbances to the edge costs to break uniform paths (with equal path cost).\nNumerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed DSA method.

Three possible reactions are discussed:\nFirst, one could deny the problem by challenging some of the assumptions that\nunderlie its formulation; second, one could accept the problem and take it to\nbe grounds for dismissing Heisenberg's or similar distinctions altogether;\nthird, one could accept the problem but take its source to be not Heisenberg's\ndistinction but the quantum formalism. A plausibility argument in support of\nthe third reaction is given by analogy: it is shown that axiomatic probability\nsuffers from a similar problem if one wishes to seriously distinguish between\nthings which are possibilities and things which are not. An enriched\naxiomatization of probability is proposed which captures the concept of\nprobability as a measure over possibilities and thereby overcomes the equality\nof inequivalents problem in axiomatic probability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Mar 2020 00:14:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-17"}

To model anatomy, Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations have been\nheld as the gold standard for calculating accurate soft-tissue deformation.\nUnfortunately, their accuracy is highly dependent on the simulation parameters,\nwhich can be difficult to obtain.\n  Methods In this work, we investigate how live data acquired during any\nrobotic endoscopic surgical procedure may be used to correct for inaccurate FEM\nsimulation results. Since FEMs are calculated from initial parameters and\ncannot directly incorporate observations, we propose to add a correction factor\nthat accounts for the discrepancy between simulation and observations. We train\na network to predict this correction factor.\n  Results To evaluate our method, we use an open-source da Vinci Surgical\nSystem to probe a soft-tissue phantom and replay the interaction in simulation.\nWe train the network to correct for the difference between the predicted mesh\nposition and the measured point cloud. This results in 15-30% improvement in\nthe mean distance, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach across a\nlarge range of simulation parameters.\n  Conclusion We show a first step towards a framework that synergistically\ncombines the benefits of model-based simulation and real-time observations.

We use four-wave mixing to implement an active frequency\nbeam-splitter and achieve interference visibilities of $0.95 \\pm 0.02$. Our\nwork establishes four-wave mixing as a tool for selective high-fidelity\ntwo-photon operations in the frequency domain which, combined with integrated\nsingle-photon sources, provides a building block for frequency-multiplexed\nphotonic quantum networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Mar 2020 01:48:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-08"}

These biases might hinder the\ndiagnostic agent to capture transportable knowledge from the simulator. This\nwork attempts to address these critical issues in MDA by taking advantage of\nthe causal diagram to identify and resolve two representative non-causal\nbiases, i.e., (i) default-answer bias and (ii) distributional inquiry bias.\nSpecifically, Bias (i) originates from the patient simulator which tries to\nanswer the unrecorded inquiries with some biased default answers. Consequently,\nthe diagnostic agents cannot fully demonstrate their advantages due to the\nbiased answers. To eliminate this bias and inspired by the propensity score\nmatching technique with causal diagram, we propose a propensity-based patient\nsimulator to effectively answer unrecorded inquiry by drawing knowledge from\nthe other records; Bias (ii) inherently comes along with the passively\ncollected data, and is one of the key obstacles for training the agent towards\n\"learning how\" rather than \"remembering what\". For example, within the\ndistribution of training data, if a symptom is highly coupled with a certain\ndisease, the agent might learn to only inquire about that symptom to\ndiscriminate that disease, thus might not generalize to the out-of-distribution\ncases. To this end, we propose a progressive assurance agent, which includes\nthe dual processes accounting for symptom inquiry and disease diagnosis\nrespectively. The inquiry process is driven by the diagnosis process in a\ntop-down manner to inquire about symptoms for enhancing diagnostic confidence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Mar 2020 02:05:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Aug 2020 01:54:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 23 Oct 2021 08:51:51 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 19 Feb 2022 07:53:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-22"}

The latter arises from\nspin-orbit coupling, which induces wave-vector-dependent spin rotations that,\nin conjunction with random disorder scattering, generate spin decoherence.\nHowever, symmetries occurring under certain conditions can prevent the\nrelaxation of particular homogeneous and inhomogeneous spin textures. The\ninhomogeneous spin texture, termed as persistent spin helix, is especially\nappealing as it enables us to manipulate the spin orientation while retaining a\nlong spin lifetime. Recently, it was predicted that such symmetries can be\nrealized in zinc-blende two-dimensional electron gases if at least two\ngrowth-direction Miller indices agree in modulus and the coefficients of the\nRashba and linear Dresselhaus spin-orbit couplings are suitably matched [PRL\n117, 236801 (2016)]. In the present paper, we systematically analyze the impact\nof the symmetry-breaking cubic Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling, which\ngenerically coexists in these systems, on the stability of the emerging spin\nhelices with respect to the growth direction. We find that, as an interplay\nbetween orientation and strength of the effective magnetic field induced by the\ncubic Dresselhaus terms, the spin relaxation is weakest for a low-symmetry\ngrowth direction that can be well approximated by a [225] lattice vector. These\nquantum wells yield a 30\\% spin-helix lifetime enhancement compared to\n[001]-oriented electron gases and, remarkably, require a negligible Rashba\ncoefficient. The rotation axis of the corresponding spin helix is only slightly\ntilted out of the quantum-well plane. This makes the experimental study of the\nspin-helix dynamics readily accessible for conventional optical spin\norientation measurements where spins are excited and detected along the\nquantum-well growth direction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Mar 2020 03:42:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 13 Jun 2020 22:08:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

First, we assess the\nnonlinear sensitivity of a neural network to lower-tropospheric stability and\nthe mid-tropospheric moisture, two widely-studied controls of moist convection.\nSecond, we couple the linearized response functions of these neural networks to\nsimplified gravity-wave dynamics, and analytically diagnose the corresponding\nphase speeds, growth rates, wavelengths, and spatial structures.

Even\nthough the SPCAM simulation has a warmer climate than the cloud-resolving\nmodel, both neural networks predict stronger heating/drying in moist and\nunstable environments, which is consistent with observations.

Then, using a tight-binding model Hamiltonian, we find that\nhigh-spin $d^5$ ions (S = 5/2) in TM-L-TM spin exchange paths prefer FM\ncoupling if the empty p-orbitals of a nonmagnetic cation M (e.g., Bi$^{3+}$\nion) hybridize strongly with those of the bridging ligand L, but AFM coupling\notherwise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Mar 2020 09:29:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-27"}

In\naddition, these GW events can be treated as the standard sirens to constrain\nvarious cosmological parameters. Both issues require the host identification\nfor these GW events, with help of the spatial resolution of GW detector\nnetworks. In this paper, we investigate the capabilities of various detector\nnetworks for identifying the SBBHs' host galaxy groups, rather than their host\ngalaxies, which can overcome the influence of galaxies' proper motions in dark\nmatter halos for measuring the cosmological parameters. In our analysis, the\ngroup catalog of SDSS DR7 with redshift $z\\in(0.01,0.1)$ is considered as an\nexample of the application.

Therefore, it is of utmost importance to study, model, and predict the\nsurface radiation environment during such events. It is well known that the\ndeep-space SEP differential energy spectrum at high energies is often given by\na power law. We use a measurement-validated particle transport code to show\nthat, for large SEP events with proton energy extending above ~ 500 MeV with a\npower-law distribution, it is sufficient to measure the SEP flux at a pivot\nenergy of ~ 300 MeV above the Martian atmosphere to predict the dose rate on\nthe Martian surface. In conjunction with a validation by in-situ measurements\nfrom the Martian surface, this remarkable simplification and elegant\nquantification could enable instant predictions of the radiation environment on\nthe surface of Mars upon the onset of large SEP events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Mar 2020 10:40:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-14"}

In contrast to charged particles, neutral\nparticles (neutrons and gamma-rays) are measured indirectly: the energy\ndeposition spectra produced by neutral particles are complex convolutions of\nthe incident particle spectra with the detector response functions. An\ninversion technique has been developed and applied to jointly unfold the\ndeposited energy spectra measured in two scintillators of different types (CsI\nfor high gamma detection efficiency, and plastic for neutrons) to obtain the\nneutron and gamma-ray spectra. This result is important for determining the\nbiological impact of the Martian surface radiation contributed by neutrons,\nwhich interact with materials differently from the charged particles. These\nfirst in-situ measurements on Mars provide (1) an important reference for\nassessing the radiation-associated health risks for future manned missions to\nthe red planet and (2) an experimental input for validating the particle\ntransport codes used to model the radiation environments within spacecraft or\non the surface of planets.

Different from traditional augmentation\nmethods such as rotation, scaling and perspective transformation, our proposed\naugmentation method is designed to learn proper and efficient data augmentation\nwhich is more effective and specific for training a robust recognizer. By using\na set of custom fiducial points, the proposed augmentation method is flexible\nand controllable. Furthermore, we bridge the gap between the isolated processes\nof data augmentation and network optimization by joint learning. An agent\nnetwork learns from the output of the recognition network and controls the\nfiducial points to generate more proper training samples for the recognition\nnetwork. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks, including regular scene\ntext, irregular scene text and handwritten text, show that the proposed\naugmentation and the joint learning methods significantly boost the performance\nof the recognition networks.

There is an online platform whose goal is to offer a\nsubset $S_t\\subseteq [n]$ of sellers to the arriving buyer at time $t$ to\nmaximize the expected revenue derived over the entire horizon while respecting\nthe inventory constraints. Given an assortment $S_t$ at time $t$, it is assumed\nthat the buyer will select an item from $S_t$ based on the well-known\nmultinomial logit model, a well-justified choice model from the economic\nliterature. In this model, the revenue obtained from selling an item $i$ at a\ngiven time $t$ critically depends on the assortment $S_t$ offered at that time\nand is given by the Nash equilibrium of a Bertrand game among the sellers in\n$S_t$. This imposes a strong dependence/externality among the offered\nassortments, sellers' revenues, and inventory levels. Despite that challenge,\nwe devise a constant competitive algorithm for the online assortment problem\nwith homogeneous buyers. We also show that the online assortment problem with\nheterogeneous buyers does not admit a constant competitive algorithm. To\ncompensate for that issue, we then consider the assortment problem under an\noffline setting with heterogeneous buyers. Under a mild market consistency\nassumption, we show that the generalized Bertrand game admits a pure Nash\nequilibrium over general buyer-seller bipartite graphs. Finally, we develop an\n$O(\\ln m)$-approximation algorithm for optimal market segmentation of the\ngeneralized Bertrand game which allows the platform to derive higher revenues\nby partitioning the market into smaller pools.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Mar 2020 15:23:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Apr 2020 07:26:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 8 Aug 2020 23:26:55 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 30 Jul 2021 17:21:33 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 9 Dec 2021 01:03:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-10"}

R. Acad. Sci. Paris\nS\\'er., 1979] and B\\'enilan & Crandall [Johns Hopkins Univ. Press, 1981], it is\nwell-known that first-order evolution problems governed by a nonlinear but\nhomogeneous operator admit the smoothing effect that every corresponding mild\nsolution is Lipschitz continuous at every positive time. Moreover, if the\nunderlying Banach space has the Radon-Nikod\\'ym property, then these mild\nsolution is a.e. differentiable, and the time-derivative satisfies global and\npoint-wise bounds.\n  In this paper, we show that these results remain true if the homogeneous\noperator is perturbed by a Lipschitz continuous mapping. More precisely, we\nestablish global $L^1$ Aronson-B\\'enilan type estimates and point-wise\nAronson-B\\'enilan type estimates. We apply our theory to derive global\n$L^q$-$L^{\\infty}$-estimates on the time-derivative of the perturbed diffusion\nproblem governed by the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator associated with the\n$p$-Laplace-Beltrami operator and lower-order terms on a compact Riemannian\nmanifold with a Lipschitz boundary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Mar 2020 03:57:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 9 Aug 2020 05:21:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2021 11:05:01 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 10:34:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-15"}
