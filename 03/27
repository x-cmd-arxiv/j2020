It describes the second-generation\nBrainScales-2 (BSS-2) version and its most recent in-silico realization, the\nHICANN-X Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), as it has been\ndeveloped as part of the neuromorphic computing activities within the European\nHuman Brain Project (HBP). While the first generation is implemented in an\n180nm process, the second generation uses 65nm technology. This allows the\nintegration of a digital plasticity processing unit, a highly-parallel micro\nprocessor specially built for the computational needs of learning in an\naccelerated analog neuromorphic systems. The presented architecture is based\nupon a continuous-time, analog, physical model implementation of neurons and\nsynapses, resembling an analog neuromorphic accelerator attached to build-in\ndigital compute cores. While the analog part emulates the spike-based dynamics\nof the neural network in continuous-time, the latter simulates biological\nprocesses happening on a slower time-scale, like structural and parameter\nchanges. Compared to biological time-scales, the emulation is highly\naccelerated, i.e. all time-constants are several orders of magnitude smaller\nthan in biology. Programmable ion channel emulation and inter-compartmental\nconductances allow the modeling of nonlinear dendrites, back-propagating\naction-potentials as well as NMDA and Calcium plateau potentials. To extend the\nusability of the analog accelerator, it also supports vector-matrix\nmultiplication. Thereby, BSS-2 supports inference of deep convolutional\nnetworks as well as local-learning with complex ensembles of spiking neurons\nwithin the same substrate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Mar 2020 16:00:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-27"}

Generally, the interpretation of experimental results\nrefers to the theoretical model developed by Nichols and Mullins, which is\nbased on conceptions about the Rayleigh instability of liquid jets.

About 3 to 4 million people with diabetes become blind\nbecause of DR every year. Diagnosis of DR through color fundus images is a\ncommon approach to mitigate such problem. However, DR diagnosis is a difficult\nand time consuming task, which requires experienced clinicians to identify the\npresence and significance of many small features on high resolution images.\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) has proved to be a promising approach for\nautomatic biomedical image analysis recently. In this work, we investigate\nlesion detection on DR fundus images with CNN-based object detection methods.\nLesion detection on fundus images faces two unique challenges. The first one is\nthat our dataset is not fully labeled, i.e., only a subset of all lesion\ninstances are marked. Not only will these unlabeled lesion instances not\ncontribute to the training of the model, but also they will be mistakenly\ncounted as false negatives, leading the model move to the opposite direction.\nThe second challenge is that the lesion instances are usually very small,\nmaking them difficult to be found by normal object detectors. To address the\nfirst challenge, we introduce an iterative training algorithm for the\nsemi-supervised method of pseudo-labeling, in which a considerable number of\nunlabeled lesion instances can be discovered to boost the performance of the\nlesion detector. For the small size targets problem, we extend both the input\nsize and the depth of feature pyramid network (FPN) to produce a large CNN\nfeature map, which can preserve the detail of small lesions and thus enhance\nthe effectiveness of the lesion detector. The experimental results show that\nour proposed methods significantly outperform the baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Mar 2020 17:13:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-27"}

The capabilities of this methodology are demonstrated for a range of\nbenchmark test cases along with large-scale models of biomedical FSI. The\nnumerical approach developed herein, which we refer to as an immersed\nLagrangian-Eulerian method, integrates aspects of partitioned and immersed FSI\nformulations by solving separate momentum equations for the fluid and solid\nsubdomains, as in a partitioned formulation, while also using non-conforming\ndiscretizations of the dynamic fluid and structure regions, as in an immersed\nformulation. A Dirichlet-Neumann coupling scheme is used, in which the motion\nof the immersed solid is driven by fluid traction forces evaluated along the\nfluid-structure interface, and the motion of the fluid along that interface is\nconstrained to match the solid velocity and thereby satisfy the no-slip\ncondition. To develop a practical numerical method, we adopt a penalty approach\nthat approximately imposes the no-slip condition along the fluid-structure\ninterface. Our fluid-structure interaction scheme relies on an immersed\ninterface method for discrete geometries, which enables the accurate\ndetermination of both velocities and stresses along complex fluid-structure\ninterfaces. Unlike commonly used partitioned FSI methods, which can suffer from\nso-called added mass effect instabilities, our methodology retains stability\nfor test cases involving extremely small, nearly equal, equal, and large\nsolid-fluid density ratios without requiring subiterations or complex handling\nof the pressure.

Existing methods decompose a face image into three components (albedo,\nnormal, and illumination) by supervised training on synthetic face data.\nHowever, due to the domain gap between real and synthetic face images, a model\ntrained on synthetic data often does not generalize well to real data.\nMeanwhile, since no ground truth for any component is available for real\nimages, it is not feasible to conduct supervised learning on real face images.\nTo alleviate this problem, we propose a weakly supervised training approach to\ntrain our model on real face videos, based on the assumption of consistency of\nalbedo and normal across different frames, thus bridging the gap between real\nand synthetic face images. In addition, we introduce a learning framework,\ncalled IlluRes-SfSNet, to further extract the residual map to capture the\nglobal illumination effects that give the fine details that are largely ignored\nin existing methods. Our network is trained on both real and synthetic data,\nbenefiting from both.

In this paper, we ask the question: can we find high-quality\nneural architectures using only images, but no human-annotated labels? To\nanswer this question, we first define a new setup called Unsupervised Neural\nArchitecture Search (UnNAS). We then conduct two sets of experiments. In\nsample-based experiments, we train a large number (500) of diverse\narchitectures with either supervised or unsupervised objectives, and find that\nthe architecture rankings produced with and without labels are highly\ncorrelated. In search-based experiments, we run a well-established NAS\nalgorithm (DARTS) using various unsupervised objectives, and report that the\narchitectures searched without labels can be competitive to their counterparts\nsearched with labels. Together, these results reveal the potentially surprising\nfinding that labels are not necessary, and the image statistics alone may be\nsufficient to identify good neural architectures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Mar 2020 17:55:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Aug 2020 15:18:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-04"}

We propose a new realization of\nself-interacting Dirac neutrinos (SID$\\nu$) with light-dark-photon mediator for\na viable interaction mechanism. Our model is UV completed by a Dirac seesaw\nwith anomaly-free dark $U(1)_X^{}$ gauge group which charges the right-handed\nneutrinos. This model naturally generates small masses for Dirac neutrinos and\ninduces self-scattering of right-handed neutrinos. The scattering with\nleft-handed neutrinos is suppressed by a chirality-flip mass insertion when the\nneutrino energy is much larger than its mass. The resultant neutrino\nself-scattering is not operative for $E_{\\nu}\\gtrsim O(\\text{keV})$, which\navoids the cosmological and laboratory constraints. By evolving Boltzmann\nequations for left- and right-handed neutrino number densities, we show that\nabout $2/3$ of the left-handed neutrinos are converted into right-handed\nneutrinos in a short epoch between the Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis and the\nrecombination, and interact with each other efficiently afterwards.

Beams for this application would have extremely high brightness\nand, subject to the intense plasma ion-derived focusing, they would achieve\ndensities high enough to induce the plasma ions to collapse into the beam\nvolume. This non-uniform ion density gives rise to strong nonlinear focusing\nwhich may lead to deleterious beam emittance growth. The effects of ion\ncollapse and their mitigation has been investigated recently through\nparticle-in-cell simulations, which show that by dynamically matching the beam\nto the focusing of the collapsed ion distribution, one may avoid serious\nemittance growth. We extend this work by exploring the near-equilibrium state\nof the beam-ion system reached after the ions have collapsed, a condition\nyielding the emittance growth mitigation observed. We show through PIC\nsimulations and analytical theory that in this case a dual electron beam-ion\nBennett-type equilibrium distribution is approached. Here, the beam and ion\ndistributions share nearly the same shape, which generates nonlinear transverse\nelectromagnetic fields. We exploit a Bennett-type model to study beam phase\nspace dynamics and emittance growth over time scales much longer than permitted\nby PIC simulations through use of a 2D symplectic tracking code with Monte\nCarlo scattering based on Moliere's theory of small angle multiple scattering.\nWe find that while phase space diffusion due to parametric excitations of the\nbeam size due to plasma non-uniformity is negligible, scattering from collapsed\nions gives rise to manageable emittance growth in the case of a linear\ncollider.

In this\npaper, we present a hydrodynamical simulation of a strongly barred galaxy,\nusing a stellar potential which is taken from observational results of NGC1300,\nand we compare cloud properties between different galactic environments: bar,\nbar-end and spiral arms.

However,\nuncertainties in the measurement of X_LAE are still debated. Thanks to deep\ndata obtained with MUSE, we can measure the evolution of X_LAE homogeneously\nover a wide redshift range of z~3-6 for UV-faint galaxies (down to\nM_1500~-17.75). This is significantly fainter than in former studies, and\nallows us to probe the bulk of the population of high-z star-forming galaxies.\nWe construct a UV-complete photo-redshift sample following UV luminosity\nfunctions and measure the Lya emission with MUSE using the second data release\nfrom the MUSE HUDF Survey. We derive the redshift evolution of X_LAE for M_1500\nin [-21.75;-17.75] for the first time with a equivalent width range EW(Lya)>=65\nA and find low values of X_ LAE<~30% at z<~6.

In addition, we do not find a\nsignificant dependence of X_LAE on M_1500 for EW(Lya)>~50 A at z~3-4, in\ncontrast with previous work. The differences in X_LAE mainly arise from\nselection biases for Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) in the literature: UV-faint\nLBGs are more easily selected if they have strong Lya emission, hence X_LAE is\nbiased towards higher values. Our results suggest either a lower increase of\nX_LAE towards z~6 than previously suggested, or even a turnover of X_LAE at\nz~5.5, which may be the signature of a late or patchy reionization process.

The rapid decline\nof honeybee populations have sparked great concern worldwide. Previous studies\nhave shown that the parasitic Varroa mite could be the main reason for colony\nlosses. In order to understand how mites affect population dynamics of\nhoneybees and a colony health, we propose a brood-adult bee-mite model in which\nthe time lag from brood to adult is taken into account. Noting that the\ndynamics of a honeybee colony varies with respect to season, we validate the\nmodel and perform parameter estimations under both constant and fluctuating\nseasonality scenarios. Our analytical and numerical studies reveal the\nfollowing: (a) In the presence of parasite mites, the large time lag from brood\nto adult could destabilize population dynamics and drive the colony to\ncollapse; but the small natural mortality of the adult population can promote a\nmite-free colony when time lag is small or at an intermediate level; (b) Small\nbrood' infestation rates could stabilize all populations at the unique interior\nequilibrium under constant seasonality while may drive the mite population to\ndie out when seasonality is taken into account; (c) High brood' infestation\nrates can destabilize the colony dynamics leading to population collapse\ndepending on initial population size under constant and seasonal conditions;\n(d) Results from sensitivity analysis indicate the queen's egg-laying may have\nthe greatest effect on colony population size. The brood death rate and the\ncolony size at which brood survivability is the half maximal were also shown to\nbe highly sensitive with an inverse correlation to the colony population size.\nOur results provide insights on the effects of seasonality on the dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Mar 2020 18:13:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 00:04:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-12"}

This state is topologically distinct from the\nconventional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer state it originates from. To the best of\nour knowledge, these findings present a first observation of bulk odd-frequency\nsuperconductivity in a TI. We thus reaffirm the potential of the TI-SC\ninterface as a versatile platform to produce novel superconducting states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Mar 2020 18:37:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2020 17:50:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}

This\npaper moves beyond chance-as-explanation to identify structural principles that\nsystematically impact the likelihood that the optimal strategy will spread. A\nformal model of innovation diffusion shows that the network structure of\norganizational relationships can systematically impact the likelihood that\nwidely adopted innovations will be payoff optimal. Building on prior diffusion\nresearch, this paper focuses on the role of central actors i.e. well-connected\npeople or firms. While contagion models of diffusion highlight the benefits of\ncentral actors for spreading innovations further and faster, the present\nanalysis reveals a dark side to this influence: the mere presence of central\nactors in a network increases rates of adoption but also increases the\nlikelihood of suboptimal outcomes.

The latter is accomplished by electrically induced spin-transfer\ntorque, which pumps energy into the magnetic system in proportion to the vortex\nflux.

However, as real world systems, such as climate data are\nnotoriously inseparable, validating this assumption by statistical tests, seems\ninherently questionable. In this paper we present an alternative approach: By\nvirtue of separability measures, we quantify how strongly the data's covariance\noperator diverges from a separable approximation. Confidence intervals localize\nthese measures with statistical guarantees. This method provides users with a\nflexible tool, to weigh the computational gains of a separable model against\nthe associated increase in bias. As separable approximations we consider the\nestablished methods of partial traces and partial products, and develop weak\nconvergence principles for the corresponding estimators. Moreover, we also\nprove such results for estimators of optimal, separable approximations, which\nare arguably of most interest in applications. In particular we present for the\nfirst time statistical inference for this object, which has been confined to\nestimation previously.

(2) To address previously reported\nsystematics in Gaia DR2 parallaxes by comparing the cluster distances derived\nfrom photometry with those derived from parallaxes. Methods: Deep UBVI\nphotometry of 16 open clusters was carried out. Observations were reduced and\nanalyzed in an automaticway using the ASteCA package to get individual\ndistances, reddening, masses, ages and metallicities. Photometric distances\nwere compared to those obtained from a Bayesian analysis of Gaia DR2\nparallaxes. Results: Ten out of the 16 clusters are true or highly probable\nopen clusters. Two of them are quite young and follow the trace of the Carina\nArm and the already detected warp. The rest of the clusters are placed in the\ninterarm zone between the Perseus and Carina Arms as expected for older\nobjects. We found that the cluster van den Berg-Hagen 85 is 7.5$\\times$10$^9$\nyrs old becoming then one of the oldest open cluster detected in our Galaxy so\nfar. The relationship of these ten clusters with the Galaxy structure in the\nsolar neighborhood is discussed. The comparison of distances from photometry\nand parallaxes data, in turn, reveals a variable level of disagreement.\nConclusions: Various zero point corrections for Gaia DR2 parallax data recently\nreported were considered for a comparison between photometric and parallax\nbased distances. The results tend to improve with some of these corrections.\nPhotometric distance analysis suggest an average correction of $\\sim$+0.026 mas\n(to be added to the parallaxes). The correction may have a more intricate\ndistance dependency, but addressing that level of detail will require a larger\ncluster sample.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Mar 2020 20:18:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-27"}

The redshift distribution of\nblack hole mergers would offer considerable information about their\nevolutionary history, including their progenitor formation rate, the dependence\nof black hole formation on stellar metallicity, and the time delay distribution\nbetween formation and merger. Efforts to measure the binary redshift\ndistribution are currently limited, however, by the detection range of existing\ninstruments, which can individually resolve compact binary merger events only\nout to $z\\lesssim1$. We present a novel strategy with which to measure the\nredshift distribution of binary black hole mergers well beyond the detection\nrange of current instruments.

Correctly\nidentifying the bounding box of the anatomical landmarks from limited field of\nviews is the key to success. In image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT), the\ndetection of those landmarks like the 12th vertebra (T12) still requires\ntedious manual inspections and annotations; and superior-inferior misalignment\nto the wrong vertebral body is still relatively common.

Math. Phys. 60, 102502 (2019)] that slowly\nlowering an electric charge into a Schwarzschild-Tangherlini (ST) black hole\nendows the final state with electric multipole fields, which implies the final\nstate geometry is not Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om-Tangherlini in nature. This\nconclusion departs from the four-dimensional case in which the no-hair theorem\n(NHT) requires the final state to be a Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om black hole. To\nbetter understand this discrepancy clearly requires a deeper understanding of\nthe origin of the multipole hair in the higher-dimensional case. In this paper,\nwe advance the conjecture that charged, static, and asymptotically-flat\nhigher-dimensional black holes can acquire electric multipole hair only after\nthey form. This supposition derives from studying the asymptotic behavior of\nthe field of a multipole charge onto which a massive and hyperspherical shell\nwith an exterior ST geometry is collapsing. In the mathematical limit as the\nshell approaches its ST radius, we find that the multipole fields (except the\nmonopole) vanish. This implies that the only information of an arbitrary (but\nfinite) charge distribution inside the collapsing shell that is available to an\nasymptotic observer is the total electric charge. Our results yield\nconsiderable insight into how higher-dimensional black holes acquire electric\nmultipole hair, and also imply that, in four dimensions, the fadeaway of\nmultipole moments during gravitational collapse is not strictly because of the\nNHT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Mar 2020 22:42:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2020 03:53:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-06"}

In\naddition, several practical situations, such as transit in cities, can benefit\nby modifying a network so as to reduce the respective shortest paths. In the\npresent work, we addressed the problem of trying to reduce the average shortest\npath of several theoretical and real-world complex networks by adding a given\nnumber of links according to different strategies. More specifically, we\nconsidered: placing new links between nodes with relatively low and high\ndegrees; to enhance the degree regularity of the network; preferential\nattachment according to the degree; linking nodes with relatively low and high\nbetweenness centrality; and linking nodes with relatively low/low, low/high,\nand high/high accessibilities.

In this initial\nII-LBM, the discontinuity related to the normal portion of the interfacial\nforce is sharply resolved by imposing the relevant jump conditions using an\napproach that is analogous to imposing the corresponding pressure jump\ncondition in the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations.

A notable application of hypernetworks in\nthe recent literature involves learning to output functional representations.\nIn these scenarios, the hypernetwork learns a representation corresponding to\nthe weights of a shallow MLP, which typically encodes shape or image\ninformation. While such representations have seen considerable success in\npractice, they remain lacking in the theoretical guarantees in the wide regime\nof the standard architectures. In this work, we study wide over-parameterized\nhypernetworks. We show that unlike typical architectures, infinitely wide\nhypernetworks do not guarantee convergence to a global minima under gradient\ndescent.

Recently, several approaches using deep neural networks\n(DNNs) such as recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been introduced for TS\nforecasting and have shown promising results. However, the applicability of\nthese approaches is being questioned for TS settings where there is a lack of\nquality training data and where the TS to forecast exhibit complex behaviors.\nExamples of such settings include financial TS forecasting, where producing\naccurate and consistent long-term forecasts is notoriously difficult. In this\nwork, we investigate whether DNN-based models can be used to forecast these TS\nconjointly by learning a joint representation of the series instead of\ncomputing the forecast from the raw time-series representations. To this end,\nwe make use of the dynamic factor graph (DFG) to build a multivariate\nautoregressive model. We investigate a common limitation of RNNs that rely on\nthe DFG framework and propose a novel variable-length attention-based mechanism\n(ACTM) to address it. With ACTM, it is possible to vary the autoregressive\norder of a TS model over time and model a larger set of probability\ndistributions than with previous approaches. Using this mechanism, we propose a\nself-supervised DNN architecture for multivariate TS forecasting that learns\nand takes advantage of the relationships between them. We test our model on two\ndatasets covering 19 years of investment fund activities. Our experimental\nresults show that the proposed approach significantly outperforms typical\nDNN-based and statistical models at forecasting the 21-day price trajectory. We\npoint out how improving forecasting accuracy and knowing which forecaster to\nuse can improve the excess return of autonomous trading strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Mar 2020 00:53:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Jun 2020 17:21:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 15:33:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-17"}

We show that contention on\nthe floating point division unit on commodity processors can be used to create\na high-performance (~100 KB/s), low-noise covert channel for transient\nexecution attacks instead of commonly used flush+reload based cache covert\nchannels.\n  We implement a Meltdown attack utilizing the proposed covert channel showing\ncompetitive performance compared to the stateof-the-art cache based covert\nchannel implementation. We also show that the covert channel works in the\nJavaScript engine of a Chrome browser.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Mar 2020 02:35:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2020 05:06:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-24"}

These works\nusually adopted a invariable injection rate of electrons ($Q$) which may be\ndiscordant with that in a Poynting-flux dominated jet. In a Poynting-flux\ndominated jet (e.g., ICMART model, Zhang & Yan 2011), the number of magnetic\nreconnections occurred simultaneously may grow rapidly with time and results in\nan increase of $Q$ with time. This paper is dedicated to study the synchrotron\nradiation spectrum in this scenario. It is found that the radiation spectrum\nwould obviously get harder if an increasing $Q$ is adopted and a Band-like\nradiation spectrum can be obtained if the increase of $Q$ is fast enough. The\nlatter is related to the fact that a bump-shape rather than a power-law\nspectrum appears in the low-energy regime of the obtained electron spectrum.\nThis effect can strongly harden the low-energy radiation spectrum. It indicates\nthat an increasing $Q$ can help to alleviate the \"fast-cooling problem\" of\nsynchrotron radiation for GRBs. Our studies also reveal that a Poynting-flux\ndominated jet with a large emission radius, a small length of the magnetic\nreconnection region, or a low-minimum energy of injected electron would prefer\nto form a Band-like radiation spectrum.

A common solution is\nto directly minimize the Shannon Entropy, but the side effect caused by entropy\nminimization, i.e., reduction of the prediction diversity, is mostly ignored.\nTo address this issue, we reinvestigate the structure of classification output\nmatrix of a randomly selected data batch.

To do so, we use state of the art scene understanding and object\ndetection methods as a pre-processing tool to detect the weird objects in the\nface. Second, we create a bag of words given all the detected out-of-context\nobjects per all training data. This way, we transform each image into a sparse\nvector where each feature represents the confidence score related to each\ndetected object in the image.

However when dealing with big\nsearch spaces the algorithm goes through several low function value regions\nbefore reaching the optimum of the function. Since the function evaluations are\nexpensive in terms of both money and time, it may be desirable to alleviate\nthis problem. One approach to subside this cold start phase is to use prior\nknowledge that can accelerate the optimisation. In its standard form, Bayesian\noptimisation assumes the likelihood of any point in the search space being the\noptimum is equal. Therefore any prior knowledge that can provide information\nabout the optimum of the function would elevate the optimisation performance.\nIn this paper, we represent the prior knowledge about the function optimum\nthrough a prior distribution. The prior distribution is then used to warp the\nsearch space in such a way that space gets expanded around the high probability\nregion of function optimum and shrinks around low probability region of\noptimum. We incorporate this prior directly in function model (Gaussian\nprocess), by redefining the kernel matrix, which allows this method to work\nwith any acquisition function, i.e. acquisition agnostic approach.

This sparsity-driven signal recovery exploits a carefully suited\nrandom sampling consensus (RANSAC) methodology for the selection of an inlier\nsubset of samples. To this aim, two fundamental properties are used: a signal\nsample represents a linear combination of the sparse coefficients, whereas the\ndisturbance degrade original signal sparsity. The properly selected samples are\nfurther used as measurements in the sparse signal reconstruction, performed\nusing algorithms from the compressive sensing framework. Besides the fact that\nthe disturbance degrades signal sparsity in the transformation domain, no other\ndisturbance-related assumptions are made -- there are no special requirements\nregarding its statistical behavior or the range of its values.

Despite widespread adoption of\nprobes, differences in their accuracy fail to adequately reflect differences in\nrepresentations. For example, they do not substantially favour pretrained\nrepresentations over randomly initialized ones. Analogously, their accuracy can\nbe similar when probing for genuine linguistic labels and probing for random\nsynthetic tasks. To see reasonable differences in accuracy with respect to\nthese random baselines, previous work had to constrain either the amount of\nprobe training data or its model size. Instead, we propose an alternative to\nthe standard probes, information-theoretic probing with minimum description\nlength (MDL). With MDL probing, training a probe to predict labels is recast as\nteaching it to effectively transmit the data. Therefore, the measure of\ninterest changes from probe accuracy to the description length of labels given\nrepresentations. In addition to probe quality, the description length evaluates\n\"the amount of effort\" needed to achieve the quality. This amount of effort\ncharacterizes either (i) size of a probing model, or (ii) the amount of data\nneeded to achieve the high quality. We consider two methods for estimating MDL\nwhich can be easily implemented on top of the standard probing pipelines:\nvariational coding and online coding.

On the other hand, photometric\nstereo methods can recover reliable geometry details, but require dense inputs\nand need to solve a complex optimization problem. In this paper, we present a\nlightweight strategy that only requires sparse inputs or even a single image to\nrecover high-fidelity face shapes with images captured under near-field lights.\nTo this end, we construct a dataset containing 84 different subjects with 29\nexpressions under 3 different lights. Data augmentation is applied to enrich\nthe data in terms of diversity in identity, lighting, expression, etc. With\nthis constructed dataset, we propose a novel neural network specially designed\nfor photometric stereo based 3D face reconstruction. Extensive experiments and\ncomparisons demonstrate that our method can generate high-quality\nreconstruction results with one to three facial images captured under\nnear-field lights.

In particular,\nscientists have concentrated on understanding how the complexity of the\ninteracting structure between different neurons, proteins or species influences\nthe functioning of their respective systems. It is well-established that many\nbiological networks are constructed in a highly hierarchical way with two main\nproperties: short average paths that join two apparently distant nodes\n(neuronal, species, or protein patches) and a high proportion of nodes in\nmodular aggregations. Although several hypotheses have been proposed so far,\nstill little is known about the relation of the modules with the dynamical\nactivity in such biological systems. Here we show that network modularity is a\nkey ingredient for the formation of self-organising patterns of functional\nactivity, independently of the topological peculiarities of the structure of\nthe modules. In particular, we propose a self-organising mechanism which\nexplains the formation of macroscopic spatial patterns, which are homogeneous\nwithin modules. This may explain how spontaneous order in biological networks\nfollows their modular structural organisation.

We formally investigate all possible small-amplitude solutions\nwhich remain bounded close to the pattern's centre (the core region) and decay\nexponentially away from the pattern's centre (the far-field region). The\nresults are presented for a finite-depth, infinite expanse of ferrofluid\nequipped with a linear magnetisation law. These patterns bifurcate at the\nRosensweig instability, where the applied magnetic field strength reaches a\ncritical threshold. Techniques for finding localised solutions to a\nnon-autonomous PDE system are established; solutions are decomposed onto a\nbasis which is independent of the radius, reducing the problem to an infinite\nset of nonlinear, non-autonomous ODEs. Using radial centre manifold theory,\nlocal manifolds of small-amplitude solutions are constructed in the core and\nfar-field regions, respectively. Finally, using geometric blow-up coordinates,\nwe match the core and far-field manifolds; any solution that lies on this\nintersection is a localised radial pattern. Three distinct classes of\nstationary radial solutions are found: spot A and spot B solutions, which are\nequipped with two different amplitude scaling laws and achieve their maximum\namplitudes at the core, and ring solutions, which achieve their maximum\namplitudes away from the core. These solutions correspond exactly to the\nclasses of localised radial solutions found for the Swift-Hohenberg equation.\nDifferent values of the linear magnetisation and depth of the ferrofluid are\ninvestigated and parameter regions in which the various localised radial\nsolutions emerge are identified.

Interfacial charge transfer is\nprimarily responsible for their peculiar electronic structure and optical\nresponse. Hence, it is essential to gain insight into this fundamental process\nalso beyond the static picture. Ab initio methods based on real-time\ntime-dependent density-functional theory coupled to the Ehrenfest molecular\ndynamics scheme are ideally suited for this problem. We investigate a\nlaser-excited hybrid inorganic/organic interface formed by the electron\nacceptor molecule 2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-7,7,8,8-tetracyano-quinodimethane\n(F4TCNQ) physisorbed on a hydrogenated silicon cluster, and we discuss the\nfundamental mechanisms of charge transfer in the ultrashort time window\nfollowing the impulsive excitation. The considered interface is $p$-doped and\nexhibits charge transfer in the ground state. When it is excited by a resonant\nlaser pulse, the charge transfer across the interface is additionally\nincreased, but contrary to previous observations in all-organic donor/acceptor\ncomplexes, it is not further promoted by vibronic coupling. In the considered\ntime window of 100~fs, the molecular vibrations are coupled to the electron\ndynamics and enhance intramolecular charge transfer. Our results highlight the\ncomplexity of the physics involved and demonstrate the ability of the adopted\nformalism to achieve a comprehensive understanding of ultrafast charge transfer\nin hybrid materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Mar 2020 10:54:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-15"}

Iterative separation methods have\ngain much attention in the community as they can flexibly decide the number of\noutputs, however (1) they typically rely on long-term information to determine\nthe stopping time for the iterations, which makes them hard to operate in a\ncausal setting; (2) they lack a \"fault tolerance\" mechanism when the estimated\nnumber of sources is different from the actual number. In this paper, we\npropose a simple training method, the auxiliary autoencoding permutation\ninvariant training (A2PIT), to alleviate the two issues. A2PIT assumes a fixed\nnumber of outputs and uses auxiliary autoencoding loss to force the invalid\noutputs to be the copies of the input mixture, and detects invalid outputs in a\nfully unsupervised way during inference phase. Experiment results show that\nA2PIT is able to improve the separation performance across various numbers of\nspeakers and effectively detect the number of speakers in a mixture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Mar 2020 10:58:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Aug 2020 04:07:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-19"}

One solution involves splitting one ventilator\nto treat multiple patients and is in principle easy to implement, but there are\nobvious risks, and little is known on how the technique would work on patients\nwith ARDS from Covid-19. Previous studies have shown that multiple test lungs\nof equal characteristics can be successfully ventilated from one machine, but\nthat large variations in tidal volume delivery occurs when lungs with different\ncompliance are connected. In contribution to the discussion of the feasibility\nof the technique, a technical assessment was done including experiments\nexpanding on the previous studies using two types of test lungs, different\nventilator settings and test lung characteristics. Using two test lungs\nconnected to a ventilator, the tidal volumes and pressures into both lungs were\nmeasured for different combinations of lung compliance, airway resistances,\nmodes of ventilation, inspiratory and end-expiratory pressure levels. We found\ndiscrepancies in delivered tidal volumes for paired test lungs proportional\nwith compliance differences, little influence from differences in airway\nresistances, and that changes in compliance of only one test lung would also\nchange the tidal volume delivered to the other test lung when in volume\ncontrolled mode. For one of the test lung types, we also found that higher PEEP\nsettings could strongly influence the tidal volume balance between the test\nlungs. From this study and from a technical point of view, we were not able to\nidentify reliable settings, adjustments or any simple measures to overcome the\nhazards of this simple technique, and a more advanced solution is indicated for\nmitigating risks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Mar 2020 12:04:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 6 Jun 2020 11:45:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-09"}

Conventional satellite communications operate in the conventional\nKu (12 GHz) and Ka (26.5-40 GHz) radio-frequency bands for assessing the feeder\nlink, between the ground gateway and the satellite. Nevertheless, with the aim\nto provide hundreds of Mbps of throughput per each user, free-space optical\n(FSO) feeder links have been proposed to fulfill these high data rates\nrequirements.

Also, the\nsystem's secrecy is improved using ZF precoding compared to the no-precoding\nscenario for some specific nodes' positions.

Their application in these areas requires precise\nknowledge of the existing exchange fields and/or the stray-fields which are\ntherefore essential for the study of these systems. Here, we determine the\neffective stray-field and the Meissner currents in a\nSuperconductor/Ferromagnet/Superconductor (S/F/S) junction produced by various\nnonhomogenous magnetic textures in the F. The inhomogeneity arises either due\nto a periodic structure with flat domain walls (DW) or is caused by an isolated\nchiral magnetic skyrmion (Sk). We consider both Bloch- and N\\'{e}el-type Sk and\nalso analyze in detail the periodic structures of different types of DW's--\nthat is Bloch-type DW (BDW) and N\\'{e}el-type DW (NDW) of finite width with in-\nand out-of-plane magnetization vector. The spatial dependence of the fields and\nMeissner currents are shown to be qualitatively different for the case of\nBloch- and N\\'{e}el-type magnetic textures.

Existing methods focus more on anomaly detection but not on repairing\nthe detected anomalies. By simply filtering out the dirty data via anomaly\ndetection, applications could still be unreliable over the incomplete time\nseries. Instead of simply discarding anomalies, we propose to (iteratively)\nrepair them in time series data, by creatively bonding the beauty of temporal\nnature in anomaly detection with the widely considered minimum change principle\nin data repairing. Our major contributions include: (1) a novel framework of\niterative minimum repairing (IMR) over time series data, (2) explicit analysis\non convergence of the proposed iterative minimum repairing, and (3) efficient\nestimation of parameters in each iteration. Remarkably, with incremental\ncomputation, we reduce the complexity of parameter estimation from O(n) to\nO(1). Experiments on real datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposal\ncompared to the state-of-the-art approaches. In particular, we show that (the\nproposed) repairing indeed improves the time series classification application.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Mar 2020 13:05:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-30"}

Such method results in the\naction-context confusion issue: context frames near action clips tend to be\nrecognized as action frames themselves, since they are closely related to the\nspecific classes.

A major challenge in\nbuilding systems that combine audio models with commodity microphones is to\nguarantee their accuracy and robustness in the real-world.

In this work, we propose Mic2Mic -- a\nmachine-learned system component -- which resides in the inference pipeline of\naudio models and at real-time reduces the variability in audio data caused by\nmicrophone-specific factors. Two key considerations for the design of Mic2Mic\nwere: a) to decouple the problem of microphone variability from the audio task,\nand b) put a minimal burden on end-users to provide training data. With these\nin mind, we apply the principles of cycle-consistent generative adversarial\nnetworks (CycleGANs) to learn Mic2Mic using unlabeled and unpaired data\ncollected from different microphones.

For each cluster we compute the iron abundance\nand gas density profiles. We aim at identifying in the iron distribution a\ncentral peak associated with the BCG, and an approximately constant plateau\nassociated with early enrichment. We are able to firmly identify the two\ncomponents in a significant fraction of the sample, simply relying on the fit\nof the abundance profile. We compute the iron mass included in the iron peak\nand plateau, and the gas mass-weighted iron abundance out to $r_{500}$. While\nthe iron plateau shows no evolution, we find marginal decrease with redshift in\nthe iron peak. We measure that the fraction of iron peak mass is typically a\nfew percent (~1%) of the total iron mass within $r_{500}$. Therefore, since the\ntotal iron mass budget is dominated by the plateau, we find consistently that\nthe global gas mass-weighted iron abundance does not evolve significantly. We\nare also able to reproduce past claims of evolution in the global iron\nabundance, which turn out to be due to the use of cluster samples with\ndifferent selection methods combined to the use of emission-weighted instead of\ngas mass-weighted abundance values. Finally, while the intrinsic scatter in the\niron plateau mass is consistent with zero, the iron peak mass exhibits a large\nscatter, in line with the fact that the peak is produced after the\nvirialization of the halo and depends on the formation of the hosting cool core\nand the associated feedback processes.

This alternative data set can\ncomplement more traditional economic indicators in times of the fast-evolving\ncrisis as it allows for a real-time analysis of risk assessments. Preliminary\nfindings suggest that the companies' awareness towards corona-related business\nrisks is ahead of the overall stock market developments. Our approach allows to\ndistinguish the industries by their risk awareness towards COVID-19. Based on\nnatural language processing, we identify corona-related risk topics and their\nperceived relevance for different industries. The preliminary findings are\nsummarised as an up-to-date online index. The CoRisk-Index tracks the\nindustry-specific risk assessments related to the crisis, as it spreads through\nthe economy. The tracking tool is updated weekly. It could provide relevant\nempirical data to inform models on the economic effects of the crisis. Such\ncomplementary empirical information could ultimately help policymakers to\neffectively target financial support in order to mitigate the economic shocks\nof the crisis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Mar 2020 14:21:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Mar 2020 16:49:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 2020 07:51:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-28"}

Due to competition of the exchange\nand the magnetic dipole interactions the minimum-energy magnon state is doubly\ndegenerate and corresponds to two antiparallel non-zero wavevectors.\nCorrespondingly, magnon BEC differs essentially from other condensates, since\nit takes place simultaneously at +/-k_min. The degeneracy of BEC and\ninteraction between its two components have significant impact on the\ncondensate properties. Phase locking of the two condensates causes formation of\na standing wave of the condensate density and quantized vortices. Additionally,\ninteraction between the two components is believed to be important for\nstabilization of the condensate with respect to the real-space collapse. Thus,\nthe possibility to create a non-degenerate, single-component condensate is\ndecisive for understanding of underlying physics of magnon BEC. Here, we\nexperimentally demonstrate an approach, which allows one to accomplish this\nchallenging task. We show that this can be achieved by using a separation of\nthe two components of the degenerate condensate in the real space by applying a\nlocal pulsed magnetic field, which causes their motion in the opposite\ndirections. Thus, after a certain delay, the two clouds corresponding to\ndifferent components become well separated in the real space.

Additionally, we show that, during the\nmotion, the condensate cloud harvests non-condensed magnons, which results in a\npartial compensation of the condensate depletion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Mar 2020 14:33:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-30"}

A technician\nwith physical access to the bus is able to replace a transmitter by a rogue\ndevice, and the receivers will accept its malicious data as they have no method\nof verifying the authenticity of messages. Updating the protocol would close\noff security loopholes in new aircraft but would require thousands of airplanes\nto be modified. For the interim, until the protocol is replaced, we propose the\nfirst intrusion detection system that utilizes a hardware fingerprinting\napproach for sender identification for the ARINC 429 data bus. Our approach\nrelies on the observation that changes in hardware, such as replacing a\ntransmitter or a receiver with a rogue one, modify the electric signal of the\ntransmission. Because we rely on the analog properties, and not on the digital\ncontent of the transmissions, we are able to detect a hardware switch as soon\nas it occurs, even if the data that is being transmitted is completely normal.\nThus, we are able to preempt the attack before any damage is caused. In this\npaper we describe the design of our intrusion detection system and evaluate its\nperformance against different adversary models. Our analysis includes both a\ntheoretical Markov-chain model and an extensive empirical evaluation. For this\npurpose, we collected a data corpus of ARINC 429 data traces, which may be of\nindependent interest since, to the best of our knowledge, no public corpus is\navailable. We find that our intrusion detection system is quite realistic:\ne.g., it achieves near-zero false alarms per second, while detecting a rogue\ntransmitter in under 50ms, and detecting a rogue receiver in under 3 seconds.\nIn other words, technician attacks can be reliably detected during the\npre-flight checks, well before the aircraft takes off.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Mar 2020 15:02:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-30"}

They are applied to study the\nspreading of infections, as in the case of CoviD-19, where the counting of the\ncumulated number $N(t)$ of detected infected individuals is a generally\naccepted, coarse-grain, variable to understand the epidemic phase. However\n$N(t)$ does not take into account the unknown number of asymptomatic, not\ndetected, cases $A(t)$. Therefore, the question arises if the observed time\nseries of data of $N(t)$ is a reliable tool for monitoring the evolution of the\ninfectious disease. We study a system of coupled differential equations which\nincludes the dynamics of the spreading among symptomatic and asymptomatic\nindividuals and the strong containment effects due to the social isolation. The\nsolution is therefore compared with a macroscopic law for the population $N(t)$\ncoming from a single, non-linear, differential equation with no explicit\nreference to $A(t)$, showing the equivalence of the two methods. Indeed, $N(t)$\ntakes into account a more complex and detailed population dynamics which\npermits the evaluation of the number of asymptomatic individuals also. The\nmodel is then applied to Covid-19 spreading in Italy where a transition from an\nexponential behavior to a Gompertz growth for $N(t)$ has been observed in more\nrecent data. Then the information contained in the data analysis of $N(t)$ is\nreliable to understand the epidemic phase, although it does not describe the\ntotal infected population.

The non-invasive VC is normally used to\ninspect a 3D reconstructed colon (from CT scans) for polyps and if found, the\nOC procedure is performed to physically traverse the colon via endoscope and\nremove these polyps. In this paper, we present a deep learning framework,\nExtended and Directional CycleGAN, for lossy unpaired image-to-image\ntranslation between OC and VC to augment OC video sequences with\nscale-consistent depth information from VC, and augment VC with\npatient-specific textures, color and specular highlights from OC (e.g, for\nrealistic polyp synthesis). Both OC and VC contain structural information, but\nit is obscured in OC by additional patient-specific texture and specular\nhighlights, hence making the translation from OC to VC lossy. The existing\nCycleGAN approaches do not handle lossy transformations. To address this\nshortcoming, we introduce an extended cycle consistency loss, which compares\nthe geometric structures from OC in the VC domain. This loss removes the need\nfor the CycleGAN to embed OC information in the VC domain. To handle a stronger\nremoval of the textures and lighting, a Directional Discriminator is introduced\nto differentiate the direction of translation (by creating paired information\nfor the discriminator), as opposed to the standard CycleGAN which is\ndirection-agnostic. Combining the extended cycle consistency loss and the\nDirectional Discriminator, we show state-of-the-art results on scale-consistent\ndepth inference for phantom, textured VC and for real polyp and normal colon\nvideo sequences.

After admixture, some\nindividuals with admixed autosomes carried the modern Homo Sapiens uniparental\nDNAs, while the rest carried the archaic versions. Coevolution of admixed\nautosomes and uniparental DNAs is expected to cause some of the sites in modern\nuniparental DNAs to revert back to archaic alleles, while the opposite process\nwould occur (from archaic to modern) in some of the sites in archaic\nuniparental DNAs. This type of coevolution is one of the elements that\ndifferentiate the two different models of the Y phylogenetic tree of modern\nhumans, rooting it either in Africa or East Asia. The expected reversion to\narchaic alleles is assumed to occur and is easily traceable in the Asia model,\nbut is absent in the Africa model due to its infinite site assumption, which\nalso precludes the independent or convergent mutation to modern alleles in\narchaic uniparental DNAs since mutations are assumed to occur randomly across a\nneutral genome, and convergent evolution is assumed not to occur. Here, we\nexamined newly published high coverage Y chromosome sequencing data of two\nDenisovan and two Neanderthal samples to determine whether they carry\nmodern-Homo Sapiens alleles in sites where they are not supposed to according\nto the Africa model. The results showed that a significant fraction of the\nsites that, according to the Asia model, should differentiate the original\nmodern Y from the original archaic Y carried modern alleles in the archaic Y\nsamples here. Some of these modern alleles were shared among all archaic humans\nwhile others could differentiate Denisovans from Neanderthals. The observation\nis best accounted for by coevolution of archaic Y and admixed modern autosomes,\nand hence supports the Asia model, since it takes such coevolution into\naccount.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Mar 2020 23:06:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-31"}

Nowadays, plenty of attention has been focused on local methods of\ncommunity detection.

In this paper, we propose a new central\nnode indicator and a new modularity function. Our central node indicator, which\nwe call local centrality indicator (LCI), is as efficient as the well-known\nglobal maximal degree indicator and local maximal degree indicator; on certain\nspecial network structure, LCI performs even better. On the other hand, our\nmodularity function F2 overcomes certain disadvantages,such as the resolution\nlimit problem,of the modularity functions raised in previous literature.\nCombined with a greedy algorithm, LCI and F2 enable us to identify the right\ncommunity structures for both the real world networks and the simulated\nbenchmark network.

The devised approach uses multi-scale extended entropic descriptors\n(ED) that quantify the degree of spatial non-uniformity of configurations of\nfinite-sized objects. This technique is an innovative development of previously\nelaborated entropy methods for statistical reconstruction. Here, we discuss the\ntwo-dimensional case, but this method can be generalized into three dimensions.\nAt the first stage, the developed procedure creates a set of black synthetic\nclusters that serve as surrogate inclusions. The clusters have the same\nindividual areas and interfaces as their target counterparts, but random\nshapes. Then, from a given number of easy-to-generate synthetic cluster\nconfigurations, we choose the one with the lowest value of the cost function\ndefined by us using extended ED. At the second stage, we make a significant\nchange in the standard technique of simulated annealing (SA). Instead of\nswapping pixels of different phases, we randomly move each of the selected\nsynthetic clusters. To demonstrate the accuracy of the method, we reconstruct\nand analyze two-phase microstructures with irregular inclusions of silica in\nrubber matrix as well as stones in cement paste. The results show that the\ntwo-stage reconstruction (TSR) method provides convincing realizations for\nthese complex microstructures. The advantages of TSR include the ease of\nobtaining synthetic microstructures, very low computational costs, and\nsatisfactory mapping in the statistical context of inclusion shapes. Finally,\nits simplicity should greatly facilitate independent applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Mar 2020 19:16:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 2020 22:21:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 9 Jul 2020 23:31:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-13"}
