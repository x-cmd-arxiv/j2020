We investigate the\nspontaneous emergence and evolution of fine structure in high-density\ncondensations formed through the process of thermal instability under typical\nsolar coronal conditions. Our study reveals intricate multidimensional\nprocesses that occur through in situ condensations in a representative coronal\nvolume in a low plasma beta regime. We performed 2D and 3D numerical\nsimulations of interacting slow magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) wave modes when all\nrelevant non-adiabatic effects are included.\n  We show that the interaction of multiple slow MHD wave modes in a regime\nunstable to the thermal mode leads to thermal instability. This initially forms\npancake-like structures almost orthogonal to the local magnetic field, while\nlow-pressure induced inflows of matter generate rebound shocks. This is\nsucceeded by the rapid disruption of these pancake sheets through thin-shell\ninstabilities evolving naturally from minute ram pressure imbalances. This\neventually creates high-density blobs accompanied by thread-like features from\nshear flow effects. The further evolution of the blobs follows the magnetic\nfield lines, such that a dynamical realignment with the background magnetic\nfield appears. However, the emerging thread-like features are not at all\nfield-aligned, implying only a very weak link between fine structure\norientation and magnetic field topology which has far-reaching implications for\nfield topology interpretations based on H$\\alpha$ observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 2020 16:24:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-29"}

These defects are dynamical and can travel\nthrough the lattice carrying both a topological charge and a fractional\nparticle number. In the hardcore limit, this phenomenon can be understood\nthrough a bulk-defect correspondence. Using a pumping argument, we show that it\nsurvives also for finite interactions, demonstrating how boson\nfractionalization can occur in strongly-correlated bosonic systems, the main\ningredients of which have already been realized in cold-atom experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 2020 17:31:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-04"}

Common methods for tractogram filtering\nare based on signal reconstruction, a principled approach, but unable to\nconsider the knowledge of brain anatomy. In this work, we address the problem\nof tractogram filtering as a supervised learning problem by exploiting the\nground truth annotations obtained with a recent heuristic method, which labels\nfibers as either anatomically plausible or non-plausible according to\nwell-established anatomical properties. The intuitive idea is to model a fiber\nas a point cloud and the goal is to investigate whether and how a geometric\ndeep learning model might capture its anatomical properties. Our contribution\nis an extension of the Dynamic Edge Convolution model that exploits the\nsequential relations of points in a fiber and discriminates with high accuracy\nplausible/non-plausible fibers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 2020 17:56:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Jul 2020 13:57:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-10"}

Such approaches are however prone\nto fail in case of e.g. fast appearance changes or presence of distractor\nobjects, where a target appearance model alone is insufficient for robust\ntracking. Having the knowledge about the presence and locations of other\nobjects in the surrounding scene can be highly beneficial in such cases. This\nscene information can be propagated through the sequence and used to, for\ninstance, explicitly avoid distractor objects and eliminate target candidate\nregions.\n  In this work, we propose a novel tracking architecture which can utilize\nscene information for tracking. Our tracker represents such information as\ndense localized state vectors, which can encode, for example, if the local\nregion is target, background, or distractor. These state vectors are propagated\nthrough the sequence and combined with the appearance model output to localize\nthe target. Our network is learned to effectively utilize the scene information\nby directly maximizing tracking performance on video segments.

Light fields provide one possible method for addressing such\nproblems by capturing a more complete visual information of a scene. In\ncontrast to a single ray from a perspective camera, Light Fields capture a\nbundle of light rays emerging from a single point in space, allowing us to see\nthrough dynamic objects by refocusing past them.\n  In this paper we present a method to synthesize a refocused image of the\nstatic background in the presence of dynamic objects that uses a light-field\nacquired with a linear camera array. We simultaneously estimate both the depth\nand the refocused image of the static scene using semantic segmentation for\ndetecting dynamic objects in a single time step. This eliminates the need for\ninitializing a static map . The algorithm is parallelizable and is implemented\non GPU allowing us execute it at close to real time speeds.

In this work, we employ the first-principles\nmany-body perturbation theory to calculate excited-state properties of a\nprototype vdW magnet, chromium trichloride (CrCl3), covering monolayer,\nbilayer, and bulk structures. Unlike usual non-magnetic vdW semiconductors, in\nwhich many-electron interactions and excited states are sensitive to\ndimensionality, many-electron interactions are always enhanced and dominate\nquasiparticle energies and optical responses of both two-dimensional and bulk\nCrCl3. The electron-hole (e-h) binding energy can reach 3 eV in monolayer and\nremains as high as 2 eV in bulk. Because of the cancellation effect between\nself-energy corrections and e-h binding energies, the lowest-energy exciton\n(optical gap) is almost not affected by the change of dimensionality. Besides,\nfor the excitons with similar e-h binding energies, their dipole oscillator\nstrength can differ by a few orders of magnitude.Our analysis shows that such a\nbig difference is from a unique interference effect between complex exciton\nwavefunctions and interband transitions. Finally, we find that the interlayer\nstacking sequence and magnetic coupling barely change quasiparticle band gaps\nand optical absorption spectra of CrCl3.

Our objective is to\nunderstand the main physics shaping the out-of-equilibrium magnetisation vs.\ntemperature curves in two different regimes. Very far from equilibrium, turning\non the magnetic field after having cooled the system in zero field (ZFC) can\nincrease the concentration of magnetic monopoles; this accelerates the\ndynamics. Similarly to electrolytes, this occurs through dissociation of bound\nmonopole pairs. However, for spin ices the polarisation of the vacuum out of\nwhich the monopole pairs are created is a key factor shaping the magnetisation\ncurves, with no analog. We observe a threshold field near $0.2T$ for this fast\ndynamics to take place, linked to the maximum magnetic force between the\nattracting pairs. Surprisingly, within a regime of low temperatures and\nmoderate fields, an extended Ohm's law can be used to describe the ZFC\nmagnetisation curve obtained with the dipolar spin-ice model. However, in real\nsamples the acceleration of the dynamics appears even sharper than in\nsimulations, possibly due to the presence of avalanches. On the other hand, the\neffect of the field nearer equilibrium can be just the opposite to that at very\nlow temperatures. Single crystals, as noted before for powders, abandon\nequilibrium at a blocking temperature $T_B$ which increases with field.\nCuriously, this behaviour is present in numerical simulations even within the\nnearest-neighbours interactions model. Simulations and experiments show that\nthe increasing trend in $T_B$ is stronger for $\\mathbf{B}\\parallel[100]$.

We\ninvestigate the use of different machine learning approaches for automating the\nidentification of mostly opaque clouds in all-sky camera data as a cloud\nwarning system. In a deep-learning approach, we train a Residual Neural Network\n(ResNet) on pre-labeled camera images.

The ResNet approach reaches an accuracy of 85% in\ndetecting clouds in a given region of an image, but requires a significant\namount of computing resources. Our lightGBM approach achieves an accuracy of\n95% with a training sample of ~1,000 images and rather modest computing\nresources.

Although recent works demonstrate encouraging results on\ndetection of certain backdoor attacks, they exhibit inherent limitations which\nmay significantly constrain the applicability. Indeed, no technique exists for\ndetecting AP attacks, which represents a harder challenge given that such\nattacks exhibit no common and explicit rules while backdoor attacks do (i.e.,\nembedding backdoor triggers into poisoned data).

On the other hand, a collective signal from many individual,\nunresolved sources results in what is known as a stochastic background. We here\nconsider probing gravity with such a background from stellar-mass binary black\nhole mergers. We adopt a simple power-law spectrum and carry out a parameter\nestimation study with a network of current and future ground-based detectors by\nincluding both general relativistic and beyond general relativistic variables.\nFor a network of second-generation detectors, we find that one can place\nmeaningful bounds on the deviation parameter in the gravitational-wave\namplitude if it enters at a sufficiently negative post-Newtonian order.\nHowever, such future bounds from a stochastic background are weaker than\nexisting bounds from individual sources, such as GW150914 and GW151226. We also\nfind that systematic errors due to mismodeling of the spectrum is much smaller\nthan statistical errors, which justifies our use of the power-law model.\nRegarding a network of third-generation detectors, we find that the bounds on\nthe deviation parameter from statistical errors improve upon the\nsecond-generation case, though systematic errors now dominate the error budget\nand thus one needs to use a more realistic spectrum model. We conclude that\nindividual sources seem to be more powerful in probing general relativity than\nthe astrophysical stochastic background.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 2020 22:00:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-08"}

Here we\nreport a statistical study of 60 CME-flare events from August 2010 to December\n2013. We investigate kinematic properties of CMEs and magnetic reconnection in\nthe low corona during the early phase of the eruptions, by combining limb\nobservations from STEREO with simultaneous on-disk views from SDO. For a subset\nof 42 events with reconnection rate evaluated by the magnetic fluxes swept by\nthe flare ribbons on the solar disk observed from SDO, we find a strong\ncorrelation between the peak CME acceleration and the peak reconnection rate.\nAlso, the maximum velocities of relatively fast CMEs (> 600 km/s) are\npositively correlated with the reconnection flux, but no such correlation is\nfound for slow CMEs. A time-lagged correlation analysis suggests that the\ndistribution of the time lag of CME acceleration relative to reconnection rate\nexhibits three peaks, approximately 10 minutes apart, and on average,\nacceleration-lead events have smaller reconnection rates. We further compare\nthe CME total mechanical energy with the estimated energy in the current sheet.\nThe comparison suggests that, for small-flare events, reconnection in the\ncurrent sheet alone is insufficient to fuel CMEs. Results from this study\nsuggest that flare reconnection may dominate the acceleration of fast CMEs, but\nfor events of slow CMEs and weak reconnection, other mechanisms may be more\nimportant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 2020 22:26:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-06"}

However,\nwhile one-shot model weights can effectively rank different network\narchitectures, the absolute accuracies from these shared weights are typically\nfar below those obtained from stand-alone training.

But what should we assume\nwhen it is an artificial intelligence (AI) system that is acting on our behalf?\nEarly examples of AI assistants like Alexa, Siri, Google, and Cortana already\nserve as a key interface between consumers and information on the web, and\nusers routinely rely upon AI-driven systems like these to take automated\nactions or provide information. Superficially, such systems may appear to be\nacting according to user interests. However, many AI systems are designed with\nembedded conflicts of interests, acting in ways that subtly benefit their\ncreators (or funders) at the expense of users. To address this problem, in this\npaper we introduce the concept of AI loyalty. AI systems are loyal to the\ndegree that they are designed to minimize, and make transparent, conflicts of\ninterest, and to act in ways that prioritize the interests of users. Properly\ndesigned, such systems could have considerable functional and competitive - not\nto mention ethical - advantages relative to those that do not. Loyal AI\nproducts hold an obvious appeal for the end-user and could serve to promote the\nalignment of the long-term interests of AI developers and customers. To this\nend, we suggest criteria for assessing whether an AI system is sufficiently\ntransparent about conflicts of interest, and acting in a manner that is loyal\nto the user, and argue that AI loyalty should be considered during the\ntechnological design process alongside other important values in AI ethics such\nas fairness, accountability privacy, and equity. We discuss a range of\nmechanisms, from pure market forces to strong regulatory frameworks, that could\nsupport incorporation of AI loyalty into a variety of future AI systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 2020 23:55:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-26"}

However, an outward dispersion from the\nincommensurate position toward q=(0,pi) is strong in intensity, inconsistent\nwith inelastic neutron scattering (INS) experiment in hole-doped cuprates.\nMotivated by this inconsistency, we use the t-t'-J model with m x n=96 lattice\nsites by changing lattice geometry from four-leg (24x4) to rectangle (12x8)\nshape and investigate the dynamical spin structure factor by using the\ndynamical density matrix renormalization group. We find that the outward\ndispersion has weak spectral weights in the 12x8 lattice, accompanied with the\ndecrease of excitation energy close to q=(pi,pi), being consistent with the INS\ndata. In the 12x8 lattice, weakening of incommensurate spin correlation is\nrealized even in the presence of the striped charge distribution.

Primordial axion fields, that exist in the\nfundamental massless gravitational (bosonic) string multiplet, couple to the\nnon-trivial GW-induced anomalies. As a result of this coupling, there exist\naxion background configurations which violate (spontaneously) Lorentz symmetry,\nand remain undiluted at the end of inflation. In models with heavy sterile\nright-handed neutrinos (RHN), such backgrounds are linked to novel (Lorentz and\nCPT Violating) mechanisms for the generation of matter-antimatter asymmetry in\nthe Cosmos, via the asymmetric decays of the RHN to standard model particles\nand antiparticles. During the QCD epoch, the axions develop an\ninstanton-induced mass and can, thus, play the r\\^ole of Dark Matter (DM). The\nenergy density of such a Universe, throughout its evolution, has the form of\nthat of a \"running vacuum model\", that is, it can be expanded in power series\nof even powers of the Hubble parameter $H(t)$. The coefficients of those terms,\nthough, are different for the various cosmological epochs. For the\nphenomenology of our model, which is consistent with the current cosmological\ndata, and could also help in alleviating (some of) the tensions, it suffices to\nconsider up to and including quartic powers of $H(t)$. In the early Universe\nphase, it is the $H^4(t)$ term, induced by the GW condensate of the\ngravitational anomaly, that drives inflation without the need for external\ninflaton fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Mar 2020 01:03:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-26"}

On a central focus, there have been longstanding interests on the\nmechanism governing data missingness, and correctly deciding the appropriate\nmechanism is crucially relevant for conducting proper practical investigations.\nThe conventional notions include the three common potential classes -- missing\ncompletely at random, missing at random, and missing not at random. In this\npaper, we present a new hypothesis testing approach for deciding between\nmissing at random and missing not at random. Since the potential alternatives\nof missing at random are broad, we focus our investigation on a general class\nof models with instrumental variables for data missing not at random. Our\nsetting is broadly applicable, thanks to that the model concerning the missing\ndata is nonparametric, requiring no explicit model specification for the data\nmissingness. The foundational idea is to develop appropriate discrepancy\nmeasures between estimators whose properties significantly differ only when\nmissing at random does not hold. We show that our new hypothesis testing\napproach achieves an objective data oriented choice between missing at random\nor not. We demonstrate the feasibility, validity, and efficacy of the new test\nby theoretical analysis, simulation studies, and a real data analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Mar 2020 02:09:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-26"}

We\nfurther discuss data and model conditions that lead to a ``low effective\ndimension\". Under these conditions, we show that the generalization error\neither does not depend on the ambient dimension $p$ or depends on $p$ via a\npoly-logarithmic factor. We also demonstrate that in several widely used\nstatistical models, the ``low effective dimension'' arises naturally in\noverparameterized settings. The studied statistical applications include both\nconvex models such as linear regression and logistic regression and non-convex\nmodels such as $M$-estimator and two-layer neural networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Mar 2020 03:08:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2021 06:13:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-05"}

In the network\nstructure of the encoder, we use multiscale convolution instead of the\ntraditional single-channel convolution.

In most existing deep learning models,\nfeature interactions are either manually designed or simply enumerated.\nHowever, enumerating all feature interactions brings large memory and\ncomputation cost. Even worse, useless interactions may introduce noise and\ncomplicate the training process. In this work, we propose a two-stage algorithm\ncalled Automatic Feature Interaction Selection (AutoFIS). AutoFIS can\nautomatically identify important feature interactions for factorization models\nwith computational cost just equivalent to training the target model to\nconvergence. In the \\emph{search stage}, instead of searching over a discrete\nset of candidate feature interactions, we relax the choices to be continuous by\nintroducing the architecture parameters.

Current methods mainly hold the assumption that a\nsupernet should give a reasonable ranking over all paths. They thus treat all\npaths equally, and spare much effort to train paths. However, it is harsh for a\nsingle supernet to evaluate accurately on such a huge-scale search space (e.g.,\n$7^{21}$). In this paper, instead of covering all paths, we ease the burden of\nsupernet by encouraging it to focus more on evaluation of those\npotentially-good ones, which are identified using a surrogate portion of\nvalidation data. Concretely, during training, we propose a multi-path sampling\nstrategy with rejection, and greedily filter the weak paths. The training\nefficiency is thus boosted since the training space has been greedily shrunk\nfrom all paths to those potentially-good ones.

This limits their deployment in energy and memory limited\napplications that require real-time learning. Matrix-vector multiplications\n(MVM) and vector-vector outer product (VVOP) are the two most expensive\noperations associated with the training of DNNs. Strategies to improve the\nefficiency of MVM computation in hardware have been demonstrated with minimal\nimpact on training accuracy. However, the VVOP computation remains a relatively\nless explored bottleneck even with the aforementioned strategies. Stochastic\ncomputing (SC) has been proposed to improve the efficiency of VVOP computation\nbut on relatively shallow networks with bounded activation functions and\nfloating-point (FP) scaling of activation gradients. In this paper, we propose\nESSOP, an efficient and scalable stochastic outer product architecture based on\nthe SC paradigm. We introduce efficient techniques to generalize SC for weight\nupdate computation in DNNs with the unbounded activation functions (e.g.,\nReLU), required by many state-of-the-art networks. Our architecture reduces the\ncomputational cost by re-using random numbers and replacing certain FP\nmultiplication operations by bit shift scaling.

Recently,\nseveral predictive process monitoring methods based on deep learning such as\nLong Short-Term Memory or Convolutional Neural Network have been proposed to\naddress the problem of next event prediction. However, due to insufficient\ntraining data or sub-optimal network configuration and architecture, these\napproaches do not generalize well the problem at hand. This paper proposes a\nnovel adversarial training framework to address this shortcoming, based on an\nadaptation of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to the realm of sequential\ntemporal data. The training works by putting one neural network against the\nother in a two-player game (hence the adversarial nature) which leads to\npredictions that are indistinguishable from the ground truth. We formally show\nthat the worst-case accuracy of the proposed approach is at least equal to the\naccuracy achieved in non-adversarial settings. From the experimental evaluation\nit emerges that the approach systematically outperforms all baselines both in\nterms of accuracy and earliness of the prediction, despite using a simple\nnetwork architecture and a naive feature encoding. Moreover, the approach is\nmore robust, as its accuracy is not affected by fluctuations over the case\nlength.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Mar 2020 08:31:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Apr 2020 09:44:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-02"}

Alternative solutions exploit single-step learning but restrict\nthe applicability to one regression technique. This paper presents a\nsingle-step approach to learn stable and accurate motions that work with any\nregression technique. The approach makes energy considerations on the learned\ndynamics to stabilize the system at run-time while introducing small deviations\nfrom the demonstrated motion. Since the initial value of the energy injected\ninto the system affects the reproduction accuracy, it is estimated from\ntraining data using an efficient procedure.

The disparity of hybrid systems and the\nvulnerability of quantum correlations have thus far hampered the generation of\nmacroscopic hybrid entanglement.

Although SQL has been standardized,\nthe full standard is based on ambiguous natural language rather than formal\nspecification. Commercial SQL implementations interpret the standard in\ndifferent ways, so that, given the same input data, the same query can yield\ndifferent results depending on the SQL system it is run on. Even for a\nparticular system, mechanically checked formalization of all widely-used\nfeatures of SQL remains an open problem. The lack of a well-understood formal\nsemantics makes it very difficult to validate the soundness of database\nimplementations.\n  Although formal semantics for fragments of SQL were designed in the past,\nthey usually did not support set and bag operations, lateral joins, nested\nsubqueries, and, crucially, null values. Null values complicate SQL's semantics\nin profound ways analogous to null pointers or side-effects in other\nprogramming languages. Since certain SQL queries are equivalent in the absence\nof null values, but produce different results when applied to tables containing\nincomplete data, semantics which ignore null values are able to prove query\nequivalences that are unsound in realistic databases.\n  A formal semantics of SQL supporting all the aforementioned features was only\nproposed recently. In this paper, we report about our mechanization of SQL\nsemantics covering set/bag operations, lateral joins, nested subqueries, and\nnulls, written in the Coq proof assistant, and describe the validation of key\nmetatheoretic properties. Additionally, we are able to use the same framework\nto formalize the semantics of a flat relational calculus (with null values),\nand show a certified translation of its normal forms into SQL.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Mar 2020 11:23:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Jun 2022 11:52:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

It is shown that the intensity-dependent\nStark-shift in the cavity and the number of coherent state photons plays a key\nrole in enhancing or destroying both QC and QD during the process of intrinsic\ndecoherence. We remarked that increasing the Stark-shift parameters, the\nfrequencies of the transition for the mode of the cavity field, and photons\nnumber destroy both the amount of QC and QD and effected their periodicity.\nMore importantly, QC and QD exhibit similar behavior and both show a revival\nphenomenon.

The pioneer work, PFE, considers uncertainty by modeling\neach face image embedding as a Gaussian distribution.

Thus,\nit is not easy to use. It is unclear how uncertainty affects feature learning.\n  This work applies data uncertainty learning to face recognition, such that\nthe feature (mean) and uncertainty (variance) are learnt simultaneously, for\nthe first time. Two learning methods are proposed. They are easy to use and\noutperform existing deterministic methods as well as PFE on challenging\nunconstrained scenarios.

Questions remain concerning the presence of nearby HII\nregions changes the properties of early HMSF and whether HII regions promote or\ninhibit the formation of high-mass stars. To characterize the role of HII\nregions on the HMSF, we study the properties of a sample of candidates\nhigh-mass starless clumps (HMSCs), of which about 90% have masses larger than\n100 Msun. These high-mass objects probably represent the earliest stages of\nHMSF; we search if (and how) their properties are modified by the presence of\nan HII region. We took advantage of the recently published catalog of HMSC\ncandidates. By cross matching the HMSCs and HII regions, we classified HMSCs\ninto three categories: 1) The HMSCs associated with HII regions both in the\nposition in the projected plane of the sky and in velocity; 2) HMSCs associated\nin the plane of the sky, but not in velocity; and 3) HMSCs far away from any\nHII regions in the projected sky plane. We carried out comparisons between\nassociated and nonassociated HMSCs based on statistical analyses of\nmultiwavelength data from infrared to radio. Statistical analyses suggest that\nHMSCs associated with HII regions are warmer, more luminous, more\ncentrally-peaked and turbulent. We also clearly show, for the first time, that\nthe ratio of bolometric luminosity to envelope mass of HMSCs (L/M) could not be\na reliable evolutionary probe for early HMSF due to the external heating\neffects of the HII regions. More centrally peaked and turbulent properties of\nHMSCs associated with HII regions may promote the formation of high-mass stars\nby limiting fragmentation. High resolution interferometric surveys toward HMSCs\nare crucial to reveal how HII regions impact the star formation process inside\nHMSCs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Mar 2020 14:56:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-13"}

Plenty of well-performing\napproximation algorithms have been designed for the maximization of (monotone\nor non-monotone) submodular functions over a variety of constraints. In this\npaper, we consider the submodular multiple knapsack problem (SMKP), which is\nthe submodular version of the well-studied multiple knapsack problem (MKP).\nRoughly speaking, the problem asks to maximize a monotone submodular function\nover multiple bins (knapsacks). Recently, Fairstein et al. (ESA20) presented a\ntight $(1-1/e-\\epsilon)$-approximation randomized algorithm for SMKP. Their\nalgorithm is based on the continuous greedy technique which inherently involves\nrandomness. However, the deterministic algorithm of this problem has not been\nunderstood very well previously. In this paper, we present a tight\n$(1-1/e-\\epsilon)$ deterministic algorithm for SMKP. Our algorithm is based on\nreducing SMKP to an exponential-size submodular maximizaion problem over a\nspecial partition matroid which enjoys a tight deterministic algorithm. We\ndevelop several techniques to mimic the algorithm, leading to a tight\ndeterministic approximation for SMKP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Mar 2020 15:42:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Jul 2020 14:31:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 2020 15:55:07 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 2021 08:38:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-26"}

Their most common variants, called Restricted Boltzmann Machines\n(RBMs) exhibit a good trade-off between computability on existing silicon-based\nhardware and generality of possible applications.\n  Still, the diffusion of RBMs is quite limited, since their training process\nproves to be hard. The advent of commercial Adiabatic Quantum Computers (AQCs)\nraised the expectation that the implementations of RBMs on such quantum devices\ncould increase the training speed with respect to conventional hardware. To\ndate, however, the implementation of RBM networks on AQCs has been limited by\nthe low qubit connectivity when each qubit acts as a node of the neural\nnetwork.\n  Here we demonstrate the feasibility of a complete RBM on AQCs, thanks to an\nembedding that associates its nodes to virtual qubits, thus outperforming\nprevious implementations based on incomplete graphs.\n  Moreover, to accelerate the learning, we implement a semantic quantum search\nwhich, contrary to previous proposals, takes the input data as initial boundary\nconditions to start each learning step of the RBM, thanks to a reverse\nannealing schedule. Such an approach, unlike the more conventional forward\nannealing schedule, allows sampling configurations in a meaningful neighborhood\nof the training data, mimicking the behavior of the classical Gibbs sampling\nalgorithm.\n  We show that the learning based on reverse annealing quickly raises the\nsampling probability of a meaningful subset of the set of the configurations.\nEven without a proper optimization of the annealing schedule, the RBM\nsemantically trained by reverse annealing achieves better scores on\nreconstruction tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Mar 2020 01:33:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Mar 2020 15:46:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-30"}

Embedding with the proposed structure, an efficient\nclassification model that accepts multi-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) as input\nis constructed. Methods: One-dimensional convolutional neural networks (CNN)\nhave proven to be effective in pervasive classification tasks, enabling the\nautomatic extraction of features while classifying targets. We implement the\nResidual connection and design a structure which can learn the weights from the\ninformation contained in different channels in the input feature map during the\ntraining process. An indicator named mean square deviation is introduced to\nmonitor the performance of a particular model segment in the classification\ntask on the two out of the five ECG classes. The data in the MIT-BIH arrhythmia\ndatabase is used and a series of control experiments is conducted. Results:\nUtilizing both leads of the ECG signals as input to the neural network\nclassifier can achieve better classification results than those from using\nsingle channel inputs in different application scenarios. Models embedded with\nthe channel-wise attention structure always achieve better scores on\nsensitivity and precision than the plain Resnet models. The proposed model\nexceeds the performance of most of the state-of-the-art models in ventricular\nectopic beats (VEB) classification, and achieves competitive scores for\nsupraventricular ectopic beats (SVEB). Conclusion: Adopting more lead ECG\nsignals as input can increase the dimensions of the input feature maps, helping\nto improve both the performance and generalization of the network model.\nSignificance: Due to its end-to-end characteristics, and the extensible\nintrinsic for multi-lead heart diseases diagnosing, the proposed model can be\nused for the real-time ECG tracking of ECG waveforms for Holter or wearable\ndevices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Mar 2020 02:28:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-27"}

For example, neural network method can\nobjectively and dynamically assign the weight of attractions, and it can\nestimate the weight of other attractions through training. Analysis, we can\nclearly understand the connection relationship between roads; then we use\nmathematical formulas to effectively combine the road network structure and\nlandscape attractions, which can correspond to the street network structure,\nthe distribution of attractions and pedestrian movement The ability to estimate\nroad congestion in low and inconsistent situations.
