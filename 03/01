One compelling\nalternative theory of gravity -- known as Einstein-dilaton Gauss-Bonnet gravity\nmotivated by string theory -- describes the presence of an additional dilaton\nscalar field coupled directly to higher orders of the curvature, effectively\ndescribing a \"fifth force\" interaction and the emission of scalar dipole\nradiation between two scalarized black holes. Most previous studies focused on\nconsidering only the leading correction to the inspiral portion of the binary\nblack hole waveforms. In our recent paper, we carried out\ninspiral-merger-ringdown consistency tests in this string-inspired gravity by\nincluding corrections to both the inspiral and ringdown portions, as well as\nthose to the mass and spin of remnant black holes, valid to quadratic order in\nspin. We here extend the analysis by directly computing bounds on the\ntheoretical coupling constant using the full inspiral-merger-ringdown waveform\nrather than treating the inspiral and merger-ringdown portions separately. We\nalso consider the corrections valid to quartic order in spin to justify the\nvalidity of black hole's slow-rotation approximation. We find the quasinormal\nmode corrections to the waveform to be particularly important for high-mass\nevents such as GW170729, in which the dilaton fields' small-coupling\napproximation fails without such effects included.

The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)\ncurve is widely used for evaluating model discrimination.

Further, compared\nto discrimination, evaluating calibration has not received the same level of\nattention. Commonly used methods for model calibration involve subjective\nspecification of smoothing or grouping. Leveraging the familiar ROC framework,\nwe introduce the model-based ROC (mROC) curve to assess the calibration of a\npre-specified model in a new sample. mROC curve is the ROC curve that should be\nobserved if a pre-specified model is calibrated in the sample.

Their\nformation is usually due to a primary symmetry breaking of a uniform state to\nstripes, often followed by secondary instabilities to form zigzag and\nlabyrinthine patterns. These secondary instabilities are well studied under\nidealized conditions of an infinite domain, however, on finite domains, the\nsituation is more subtle since the unstable modes depend also on boundary\nconditions. Using two prototypical models, the Swift-Hohenberg equation and the\nforced complex Ginzburg-Landau equation, we consider bounded domains with no\nflux boundary conditions transversal to the stripes, and reveal a distinct\nmixed-mode instability that lies in between the classical zigzag and the\nEckhaus lines. This explains the stability of stripes in the mildly zigzag\nunstable regime, and, after crossing the mixed-mode line, the evolution of\nzigzag stripes in the bulk of the domain and the formation of defects near the\nboundaries.

Previous researches on CBPs mostly\nregarded them as an isolated binary-planet system, without considering the\nbirth environment of their host binaries. It is generally believed that almost\nall stars are born in clusters. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the\nimpact of the close encounters of stars on the CBP systems. This article\ndiscusses how the close encounters of fly-by stars affect the inclination of\nCBP. Based on extensive numerical simulations, we found that CBPs in close\nbinary with a spacing of about 0.2 au are almost unaffected by star fly-bys.\nTheir orbits remain coplanar. However, when the spacing of the binary stars is\ngreater than 1 au, the 2-3 fly-bys of the intruding star can excite a\nconsiderable inclination even for the CBP near the unstable boundary of the\nbinary. For the planets in the outer region, a single star fly-by can excite an\ninclination to more than 5 degrees. Especially, CBPs in near polar or\nretrograde orbits can naturally form through bianry-star encounters. If close\nbinaries are born in open clusters, our simulations suggest that there may be\nhigh-inclination CBPs in binaries with spacing > 1 au.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Mar 2020 01:17:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-03"}

However, gradient-based\noptimization has not yet been applied to the mode-expansion methods that are\nthe most common approach to studying periodic optical structures like photonic\ncrystals. This is because, in such simulations, the adjoint variable method\ncannot be defined as explicitly as in standard finite-difference or\nfinite-element time- or frequency-domain methods. Here, we overcome this\nthrough the use of automatic differentiation, which is a generalization of the\nadjoint variable method to arbitrary computational graphs. We implement the\nplane-wave expansion and the guided-mode expansion methods using an automatic\ndifferentiation library, and show that the gradient of any simulation output\ncan be computed efficiently and in parallel with respect to all input\nparameters. We then use this implementation to optimize the dispersion of a\nphotonic crystal waveguide, and the quality factor of an ultra-small cavity in\na lithium niobate slab.

Finally, it is\nshown that the local diameter two property, the diameter two property, the\nstrong diameter two property are equivalent in function and sequence Orlicz\nspaces with the Luxemburg norm under appropriate conditions on $\\varphi$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Mar 2020 04:20:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Jan 2023 23:03:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-04"}

When a small fraction of particles in the supercooled liquid is made\nheavier, they exhibit slower dynamics than the original particles and also make\nthe overall system slower. If one looks at the overlap correlation function to\nquantify dynamics in the system, it has different behavior for the heavy and\nthe light particles. In particular, at the relaxation time of the overall\nsystem, the degree of relaxation achieved by the heavier particles is lesser on\naverage than that achieved by the light particles. This difference in\nrelaxation however, goes down drastically as a crossover temperature, $T_0$, is\ncrossed. Below this crossover temperature, particles in the system have similar\nrelaxation times irrespective of their masses. This crossover temperature\ndepends on the fraction of the heavy particles and their masses. Next, we\nisolate the effect of mass heterogeneity on the dynamics of supercooled liquids\nand find that its effect increases monotonically with temperature.

The conditional shift operator\nshifts the position of the walker to right or left by unit step size while the\ndirection of motion is specified by the coin operator. This scenario can be\ngeneralized by choosing the step size randomly at each step in some specific\ninterval. For example, the value of the roll of a dice can be used to specify\nthe step size after throwing the coin. Let us call such a quantum walk\n\"Discrete-time Random Step Quantum Walk (DTRSQW)\".

Unlike other GNSS signals, there is no\npilot component for synchronization in BeiDou B1/B3 signals, which increases\nthe complexity in acquisition. A previous study has shown that the delay and\nmultiplication (DAM) method is able to eliminate the bit sign transition\nproblem, but it only applies to pretty strong signals. In this paper, a\nDAM-based BeiDou signal acquisition approach, called variable length data\naccumulation (VLDA), is proposed to acquire weak satellite signals. Firstly,\nthe performance of DAM method versus the different delays is analyzed. The DAM\noperation not only eliminates bit sign transition, but it also increases noise\npower. Secondly, long-term signal is periodically accumulated to improve signal\nintensity in order to acquire weak signals. While considering the Doppler\nfrequency shift of ranging codes, the signal length must be compensated before\naccumulating long-term signal. Finally, the fast-Fourier-transform based\nparallel code phase algorithm are used for acquisition. The simulation results\nindicate that the proposed VLDA method has better acquisition sensitivity than\ntraditional non-coherent integration method under the same calculation amount.\nThe VLDA method only requires approximately 27.5% of calculations to achieve\nthe same acquisition sensitivity (35 dBHz). What is more, the actual\nexperimental results verify the feasibility of the VLDA method. It can be\nconcluded that the proposed approach is an effective and feasible method for\nsolving the bit sign transition problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Mar 2020 10:49:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-03"}

The\nsmooth function is based on B-splines, typically cubic. In contrast, the\ncharacteristic scores for traditional scorecards are step functions of the\ncharacteristics. Previously, there were two ways to control the smoothness of\nthe liquid characteristic score: (1) coarse classing where the fewer the number\nof classes, the smoother the curve; (2) the penalty parameter, which penalizes\nthe norm of the score coefficient vector. However, in classical cubic spline\nfitting theory, a direct measure of curve roughness is used as a penalty term\nin the fitting objective function. In this paper, I work out the details of\nthis concept for our characteristic scores, which are linear functions of a\ncubic B-spline basis. The roughness penalty is the integral of the second\nderivative squared. As you vary the characteristic smoothness parameter from\nzero to infinity, the characteristic score goes from being rough to being very\nsmooth. As one moves from rough to smooth, the palatable characteristic score\njumps off the page. This is illustrated by a case study.

One approach to\nstudy these concerns is through the lens of differential privacy. In this\nframework, privacy guarantees are generally obtained by perturbing models in\nsuch a way that specifics of data used to train the model are made ambiguous. A\nparticular instance of this approach is through a \"teacher-student\" framework,\nwherein the teacher, who owns the sensitive data, provides the student with\nuseful, but noisy, information, hopefully allowing the student model to perform\nwell on a given task without access to particular features of the sensitive\ndata. Because stronger privacy guarantees generally involve more significant\nperturbation on the part of the teacher, deploying existing frameworks\nfundamentally involves a trade-off between student's performance and privacy\nguarantee. One of the most important techniques used in previous works involves\nan ensemble of teacher models, which return information to a student based on a\nnoisy voting procedure. In this work, we propose a novel voting mechanism with\nsmooth sensitivity, which we call Immutable Noisy ArgMax, that, under certain\nconditions, can bear very large random noising from the teacher without\naffecting the useful information transferred to the student.\n  Compared with previous work, our approach improves over the state-of-the-art\nmethods on all measures, and scale to larger tasks with both better performance\nand stronger privacy ($\\epsilon \\approx 0$).

It is a manifestation of a wide\nphase-slip domain. The topological transition accompanying the phase-slip\neffect consists in the occurrence of two new loops of weak superconducting\ncurrents connecting two regions of superconducting screening currents, which\nare disconnected in case of vortex-chain dynamics. In the middle of the\nphase-slip domain, rapid dynamics of the superconducting order parameter\nconsists in decoupling of a spontaneously nucleated vortex-antivortex pair,\nsubsequent motion of a vortex and an antivortex in the opposite directions\nfollowed by their annihilation with an antivortex and a vortex from the\nadjacent pairs. The submicron-scale inhomogeneity of the magnetic field can be\nachieved through a direct patterning of the magnetic field applied to a planar\nmembrane or using advanced nanostructuring, such as roll-up technology, focused\nion-beam deposition or coating carbon nanotubes by superconducting materials.\nIf the applied magnetic field is orthogonal to the axis of a microtube, which\ncarries transport current in the azimuthal direction, the phase-slip regime is\ncharacterized by the vortex-antivortex lifetime of 10E-15 s versus 10E-12 s for\ndisconnected vortex dynamics in the half-tubes.

Consequently, a lot of recent research effort was\ndedicated to proposing wave-front shaping protocols to implement coherent PA in\na complex scattering environment. Here, instead of shaping the impinging wave\nfront and tuning the system's attenuation, we propose the conceptually\ndifferent route of solely tweaking the randomness of the complex scattering\nenvironment in order to achieve PA. We provide an experimental proof-of-concept\nin the microwave domain where we tune the randomness of a three-dimensional\nchaotic cavity with a programmable metasurface.

The\nBroadening Participation in Data Mining (BPDM) workshop was created more than 7\nyears ago with the goal of fostering mentorship, guidance, and connections for\nminority and underrepresented groups in the data science and machine learning\ncommunity, while also enriching technical aptitude and exposure for a group of\ntalented students. To date it has impacted the lives of more than 330\nunderrepresented trainees in data science. We provide a venue to connect\ntalented students with innovative researchers in industry, academia,\nprofessional societies, and government. Our mission is to facilitate\nmeaningful, lasting relationships between BPDM participants to ultimately\nincrease diversity in data mining. This most recent workshop took place at\nHoward University in Washington, DC in February 2019. Here we report on the\nmentoring strategies that we undertook at the 2019 BPDM and how those were\nreceived.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Mar 2020 03:40:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-20"}

In physical\nrehabilitation, the progress in machine learning and the advent of affordable\nand reliable motion capture sensors have been conducive to the development of\napproaches for automated assessment of patient performance and progress toward\nfunctional recovery. The presented study reviews computational approaches for\nevaluating patient performance in rehabilitation programs using motion capture\nsystems. Such approaches will play an important role in supplementing\ntraditional rehabilitation assessment performed by trained clinicians, and in\nassisting patients participating in home-based rehabilitation. The reviewed\ncomputational methods for exercise evaluation are grouped into three main\ncategories: discrete movement score, rule-based, and template-based approaches.\nThe review places an emphasis on the application of machine learning methods\nfor movement evaluation in rehabilitation. Related work in the literature on\ndata representation, feature engineering, movement segmentation, and scoring\nfunctions is presented. The study also reviews existing sensors for capturing\nrehabilitation movements and provides an informative listing of pertinent\nbenchmark datasets.

For purely\nsynthetic constructions, we apply the recently introduced method of\nvisualization of 4-space by its double orthogonal projection onto two mutually\nperpendicular 3-spaces to investigate the Hopf fibration as a four-dimensional\nrelation without analogy in lower dimensions. In this paper, the method of\ndouble orthogonal projection is used for a direct synthetic construction of the\nfibers of a 3-sphere from the corresponding points on a 2-sphere. The fibers of\ngreat circles on the 2-sphere create nested tori visualized in a stereographic\nprojection onto the modeling 3-space. The step-by-step construction is\nsupplemented by dynamic three-dimensional models showing simultaneously the\n3-sphere, 2-sphere, and stereographic images of the fibers and mutual\ninterrelations. Each step of the synthetic construction is supported by its\nanalytical representation to highlight connections between the two\ninterpretations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Feb 2020 21:40:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Jan 2021 23:48:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 21 May 2021 09:31:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-24"}

The discovery of temporal soliton states\n(DKS dissipative Kerr solitons) [4,7-11] as a means of modelocking microcombs\nhas enabled breakthroughs in many fields including spectroscopy [12,13],\nmicrowave photonics [14], frequency synthesis [15], optical ranging [16,17],\nquantum sources [18,19], metrology [20,21] and more. One of their most\npromising applications has been optical fibre communications where they have\nenabled massively parallel ultrahigh capacity multiplexed data transmission\n[22,23]. Here, by using a new and powerful class of microcomb called soliton\ncrystals [11], we achieve unprecedented data transmission over standard optical\nfibre using a single integrated chip source. We demonstrate a line rate of 44.2\nTerabits per second using the telecommunications C band at 1550nm with a\nspectral efficiency, a critically important performance metric, of 10.4\nbits/s/Hz. Soliton crystals exhibit robust and stable generation and operation\nas well as a high intrinsic efficiency that, together with a low soliton\nmicrocomb spacing of 48.9 GHz enable the use of a very high coherent data\nmodulation format of 64 QAM (quadrature amplitude modulated). We demonstrate\nerror free transmission over 75 km of standard optical fibre in the laboratory\nas well as in a field trial over an installed metropolitan optical fibre\nnetwork. These experiments were greatly aided by the ability of the soliton\ncrystals to operate without stabilization or feedback control. This work\ndemonstrates the capability of optical soliton crystal microcombs to perform in\ndemanding and practical optical communications networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 1 Mar 2020 05:03:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-02"}

To overcome these challenges, supplier\ncountries require take-or-pay agreements for requested natural gas quantities.\nThese contracts have many pre-clauses; if they are not met due to low/high\nconsumption or other external factors, buyers must completely fulfill them. A\nsimilar contract is then imposed on distributors and wholesale consumers. It is\nthus important for all parties to forecast their daily, monthly, and annual\nnatural gas demand to minimize their risk. In this paper, a model consisting of\na modulated expansion in Fourier series, supplemented by deviations from\ncomfortable temperatures as a regressor is proposed for the forecast of monthly\nand weekly consumption over a one-year horizon. This model is supplemented by a\nday-ahead feedback mechanism for the forecast of daily consumption. The method\nis applied to the study of natural gas consumption for major residential areas\nin Turkey, on a yearly, monthly, weekly, and daily basis. It is shown that\nresidential heating dominates winter consumption and masks all other\nvariations. On the other hand, weekend and holiday effects are visible in\nsummer consumption and provide an estimate for residential and industrial use.\nThe advantage of the proposed method is the capability of long term projections\nand to outperform time series methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Feb 2020 20:48:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-31"}
