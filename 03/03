While theoretical classification frameworks have been\nused to identify thousands of candidate topological materials, experimental\ndetermination of materials' topology often poses significant technical\nchallenges. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is a widely-used materials\ncharacterization technique sensitive to atoms' local symmetry and chemical\nbonding, which are intimately linked to band topology by the theory of\ntopological quantum chemistry (TQC). Moreover, as a local structural probe, XAS\nis known to have high quantitative agreement between experiment and\ncalculation, suggesting that insights from computational spectra can\neffectively inform experiments. In this work, we leverage computed X-ray\nabsorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectra of more than 10,000 inorganic\nmaterials to train a neural network (NN) classifier that predicts topological\nclass directly from XANES signatures, achieving F$_1$ scores of 89% and 93% for\ntopological and trivial classes, respectively. Additionally, we obtain\nconsistent classifications using corresponding experimental and computational\nXANES spectra for a small number of measured compounds.

A joint\nuser-centric virtual cell formation and resource allocation problem is\ninvestigated to bring eco-solutions at the edge. This joint problem aims to\ncombat against the power-hungry edge nodes while maintaining assured\nreliability and data rate. More specifically, by prioritizing the downlink\ncommunication of dynamic eco-routing, highly mobile autonomous vehicles are\nserved with multiple low-powered access points (APs) simultaneously for\nubiquitous connectivity and guaranteed reliability of the network. The\nformulated optimization is exceptionally troublesome to solve within a\npolynomial time, due to its complicated combinatorial structure. Hence, a\ndistributed multi-agent reinforcement learning (D-MARL) algorithm is proposed\nfor eco-vehicular edges, where multiple agents cooperatively learn to receive\nthe best reward.

We\nconsider the bipartite graph and formalize its representation learning problem\nas a statistical estimation problem of parameters in a semiparametric\nexponential family distribution. The bipartite graph is assumed to be generated\nby a semiparametric exponential family distribution, whose parametric component\nis given by the proximity of outputs of two one-layer neural networks, while\nnonparametric (nuisance) component is the base measure. Neural networks take\nhigh-dimensional features as inputs and output embedding vectors. In this\nsetting, the representation learning problem is equivalent to recovering the\nweight matrices. The main challenges of estimation arise from the nonlinearity\nof activation functions and the nonparametric nuisance component of the\ndistribution. To overcome these challenges, we propose a pseudo-likelihood\nobjective based on the rank-order decomposition technique and focus on its\nlocal geometry. We show that the proposed objective is strongly convex in a\nneighborhood around the ground truth, so that a gradient descent-based method\nachieves linear convergence rate.

The main reason behind\nEMV service delay is the lack of communication and cooperation between vehicles\nblocking EMVs. In this paper, we study the improvement of EMV service under V2X\nconnectivity. We consider the establishment of dynamic queue jump lanes (DQJLs)\nbased on real-time coordination of connected vehicles in the presence of\nnon-connected human-driven vehicles. We develop a novel Markov decision process\nformulation for the DQJL coordination strategies, which explicitly accounts for\nthe uncertainty of drivers' yielding pattern to approaching EMVs. Based on\npairs of neural networks representing actors and critics for agent vehicles, we\ndevelop a multi-agent actor-critic deep reinforcement learning algorithm that\nhandles a varying number of vehicles and a random proportion of connected\nvehicles in the traffic. Approaching the optimal coordination strategies via\nindirect and direct reinforcement learning, we present two schemata to address\nmulti-agent reinforcement learning on this connected vehicle application. Both\napproaches are validated, on a micro-simulation testbed SUMO, to establish a\nDQJL fast and safely.

This\nscalability issue prevents MARL from being applied in large-scale multiagent\nsystems. However, one critical feature in MARL that is often neglected is that\nthe interactions between agents are quite sparse. Without exploiting this\nsparsity structure, existing works aggregate information from all of the agents\nand thus have a high sample complexity. To address this issue, we propose an\nadaptive sparse attention mechanism by generalizing a sparsity-inducing\nactivation function. Then a sparse communication graph in MARL is learned by\ngraph neural networks based on this new attention mechanism. Through this\nsparsity structure, the agents can communicate in an effective as well as\nefficient way via only selectively attending to agents that matter the most and\nthus the scale of the MARL problem is reduced with little optimality\ncompromised.

The endmembers of a hyperspectral\nimage (HSI) are more likely to be generated by independent sources and be mixed\nin a macroscopic degree before arriving at the sensor element of the imaging\nspectrometer as mixed spectra. Over the past few decades, many attempts have\nfocused on imposing auxiliary constraints on the conventional nonnegative\nmatrix factorization (NMF) framework in order to effectively unmix these mixed\nspectra. As a promising step toward finding an optimum constraint to extract\nendmembers, this paper presents a novel blind HU algorithm, referred to as\nKurtosis-based Smooth Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (KbSNMF) which\nincorporates a novel constraint based on the statistical independence of the\nprobability density functions of endmember spectra. Imposing this constraint on\nthe conventional NMF framework promotes the extraction of independent\nendmembers while further enhancing the parts-based representation of data.\nExperiments conducted on diverse synthetic HSI datasets (with numerous numbers\nof endmembers, spectral bands, pixels, and noise levels) and three standard\nreal HSI datasets demonstrate the validity of the proposed KbSNMF algorithm\ncompared to several state-of-the-art NMF-based HU baselines.

Remarkably, this glass\ntransition disappears as T1 transitions are temporally limited. As a unique\nconsequence of limited rearrangements, we also find that the tissue develops\nspatially correlated streams of fast and slow cells, in which the fast cells\norganize into stream-like patterns with leader-follower interactions, and\nmaintain optimally stable cell-cell contacts.

Rather than the U-curve emblematic\nof the bias-variance trade-off, their test error often follows a \"double\ndescent\" - a mark of the beneficial role of overparametrization. In this work,\nwe develop a quantitative theory for this phenomenon in the so-called lazy\nlearning regime of neural networks, by considering the problem of learning a\nhigh-dimensional function with random features regression. We obtain a precise\nasymptotic expression for the bias-variance decomposition of the test error,\nand show that the bias displays a phase transition at the interpolation\nthreshold, beyond which it remains constant.

Following up on Geiger\net al. 2019, we first show that the latter two contributions are the crux of\nthe double descent: they lead to the overfitting peak at the interpolation\nthreshold and to the decay of the test error upon overparametrization. We then\nquantify how they are suppressed by ensemble averaging the outputs of K\nindependently initialized estimators. When K is sent to infinity, the test\nerror remains constant beyond the interpolation threshold. We further compare\nthe effects of overparametrizing, ensembling and regularizing.

Being more specific, we start by outlining a historical\nsummary of fractional calculus. Then, following this motivation, a (very) brief\nappraisal of fractional quantum mechanics is presented, but where details\n(namely those of a mathematical nature) are left for literature perusing.\nSubsequently, the application of fractional calculus in quantum cosmology is\nintroduced, advocating it as worthy to consider: if the progress of fractional\ncalculus serves as an argument, indeed useful consequences will also be drawn\n(to cite from Leibnitz). In particular, we discuss different difficulties that\nmay affect the operational framework to employ, namely the issues of\nminisuperspace covariance and fractional derivatives, for instance. An example\nof investigation is provided by means of a very simple model. Concretely, we\nrestrict ourselves to speculate that with minimal fractional calculus elements,\nwe may have a peculiar tool to inspect the flatness problem of standard\ncosmology.

Performing a nonperturbative\nanalysis based on holographic QCD and the generalized Veneziano model, we study\nthe constraints on the $[c(x)-\\bar{c}(x)]$ distribution from the lattice QCD\nresults presented here. Our results provide complementary information and\nmotivation for more detailed studies of physical observables that are sensitive\nto intrinsic charm and for future global analyses of parton distributions\nincluding asymmetric charm-anticharm distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 2020 18:10:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2020 17:29:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 21 Sep 2020 01:26:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-22"}

In order\nto minimize the limit of detection (LOD) of such sensor systems, it is of high\nimportance to understand and to be able to quantify the relevant noise sources.\nIn this contribution, cantilever-type electromechanic and magnetoelastic\nresonators, respectively, are comprehensively investigated and mathematically\ndescribed not only with regard to their phase sensitivity but especially to the\nextent of the sensor-intrinsic phase noise. Both measurements and calculations\nreveal that the fundamental LOD is limited by additive phase noise due to\nthermal-mechanical noise of the resonator, i.e. by thermally induced random\nvibrations of the cantilever, and by thermal-electrical noise of the\npiezoelectric material. However, due to losses in the magnetic material\nparametric flicker phase noise arises, limiting the overall performance. In\nparticular it is shown that the LOD is virtually independent of the magnetic\nsensitivity but is solely determined by the magnetic losses. Instead of the\nsensitivity, the magnetic losses, represented by the material's effective\ncomplex permeability, should be considered as the most important parameter for\nthe further improvement of such sensors in the future.

The Learning\nControllable Embedding (LCE) framework addresses these challenges by embedding\nthe observations into a lower dimensional latent space, estimating the latent\ndynamics, and then performing control directly in the latent space. To ensure\nthe learned latent dynamics are predictive of next-observations, all existing\nLCE approaches decode back into the observation space and explicitly perform\nnext-observation prediction---a challenging high-dimensional task that\nfurthermore introduces a large number of nuisance parameters (i.e., the\ndecoder) which are discarded during control.

The hydrodynamic\ntrap is adapted from a previously implemented Stokes trap by incorporating a\ndrop-on-demand system to generate droplets at a T-junction geometry on the same\nmicrofluidic chip. We then study confined droplet dynamics in response to\nperturbation by applying a millisecond-pressure pulse to deform trapped\ndroplets. Droplet shape relaxation after cessation of the pressure pulse\nfollows an exponential decay. The characteristic droplet shape relaxation time\nis obtained from the shape decay curves for aqueous glycerol droplets of\nvarying viscosities in the dispersed phase with light and heavy mineral oils in\nthe continuous phase. Systems were chosen to provide similar equilibrium\ninterfacial tensions (5-10 mN/m) with wide variations of viscosity ratios. It\nis found that the droplet shape relaxation shows a strong dependence on droplet\nradius, and a weak dependence on the ratio of dispersed to continuous phase\nviscosity. The relaxation time is smaller for the highest viscosity ratios,\npotentially indicating that the dominant viscosity controls the droplet shape\nrelaxation time in addition to the interfacial tension and droplet size.\nDroplet shape relaxation time can be used inform the response of droplets in an\nemulsion when subjected to transient flows in various processing conditions.\nFinally, an application of this platform for directly visualizing individual\ndroplet coalescence in a planar extensional flow is presented. The microfluidic\nfour-channel hydrodynamic trap can thus be applied for studying fundamental\nphysics of droplet deformation and droplet-droplet interactions on the\nmicro-scale to provide an enhanced understanding of emulsion behavior on an\nindividual droplet level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 2020 18:57:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-13"}

The five galaxies cover a narrow\nstellar mass range [$M_\\star=(0.6{-}4.6)\\times10^8~{\\rm M}_\\odot$], but have\nwidely different accretion redshifts ($z_{\\rm acc}=0.57{-}2.65$). All accretion\nevents represent minor mergers, but Kraken likely represents the most major\nmerger ever experienced by the Milky Way, with stellar and virial mass ratios\nof $r_{M_\\star}=1$:$31^{+34}_{-16}$ and $r_{M_{\\rm h}}=1$:$7^{+4}_{-2}$,\nrespectively. The progenitors match the $z=0$ relation between GC number and\nhalo virial mass, but have elevated specific frequencies, suggesting an\nevolution with redshift. Even though these progenitors likely were the Milky\nWay's most massive accretion events, they contributed a total mass of only\n$\\log{(M_{\\rm \\star,tot}/{\\rm M}_\\odot)}=9.0\\pm0.1$, similar to the stellar\nhalo. This implies that the Milky Way grew its stellar mass mostly by in-situ\nstar formation. We conclude by organising these accretion events into the most\ndetailed reconstruction to date of the Milky Way's merger tree.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 2020 19:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-30"}

Most of these binaries experience one or more\nphases of mass transfer, during which one of the stars loses part or all of its\nouter envelope and becomes a stripped-envelope star. The evolution of the size\nof these stripped stars is crucial in determining whether they experience\nfurther interactions and their final fate. We present new calculations of\nstripped-envelope stars based on binary evolution models computed with MESA. We\nuse these to investigate their radius evolution as a function of mass and\nmetallicity. We further discuss their pre-supernova observable characteristics\nand potential consequences of their evolution on the properties of supernovae\nfrom stripped stars. At high metallicity we find that practically all of the\nhydrogen-rich envelope is removed, in agreement with earlier findings. Only\nprogenitors with initial masses below 10\\Msun expand to large radii (up to\n100\\Rsun), while more massive progenitors stay compact. At low metallicity, a\nsubstantial amount of hydrogen remains and the progenitors can, in principle,\nexpand to giant sizes (> 400\\Rsun), for all masses we consider. This implies\nthat they can fill their Roche lobe anew. We show that the prescriptions\ncommonly used in population synthesis models underestimate the stellar radii by\nup to two orders of magnitude. We expect that this has consequences for the\npredictions for gravitational-wave sources from double neutron star mergers, in\nparticular for their metallicity dependence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 2020 19:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-06"}

In this paper we synthesise the X-ray energy spectra resulting from\ndifferent lines of sight through a state of the art radiation hydrodynamics UV\nline driven disc wind simulation. We demonstrate that there are some lines of\nsight which only intercept highly ionised and fast outflowing material.

We\nfit these simulated wind spectra to data from the archetypal UFO source PG\n1211+143 and show that they broadly reproduce the depth and velocity of the\niron absorption lines seen. This directly demonstrates that UV line driving is\na viable mechanism to launch even the fastest UFOs.

The recent introduction\nof non-Hermitian topological classifications opens up new opportunities for\nengineering topological phases in dissipative systems. Here, we propose a\nmagnonic realization of a non-Hermitian topological system. A crucial\ningredient of our proposal is the injection of spin current into the magnetic\nsystem, which alters and can even change the sign of terms describing\ndissipation.

Aim: We modeled the probability that a PR will be accepted within a\nmonth after creation using a Random Forest model utilizing 50 predictors\nrepresenting properties of the author, PR, and the project to which PR is\nsubmitted. Method: 483,988 PRs from 4218 popular NPM packages were analysed and\nwe selected a subset of 14 predictors sufficient for a tuned Random Forest\nmodel to reach high accuracy. Result: An AUC-ROC value of 0.95 was achieved\npredicting PR acceptance. The model excluding PR properties that change after\nsubmission gave an AUC-ROC value of 0.89.

In this vision paper, we propose\nverification based on probabilities of errors both estimated by controlled\nexperiments and output by the inductively learned classifier itself.\nGeneralization error bounds may propagate to the probabilities of a hazard,\nwhich must not exceed a THR.

We consider\na large class of potentials, given by general radial nonnegative kernels which\nare integrable on $\\mathbb{R}^n$, such as Bessel potentials, and study the\nbehavior of the problem for large masses (i.e., volumes). Contrarily to the\nsmall mass case, where the nonlocal term becomes negligible compared to the\nperimeter, here the nonlocal term explodes compared to it. However, using the\nintegrability of those kernels, we rewrite the problem as the minimization of\nthe difference between the classical perimeter and a nonlocal perimeter, which\nconverges to a multiple of the classical perimeter as the mass goes to\ninfinity. Renormalizing to a fixed volume, we show that, if the first moment of\nthe kernels is smaller than an explicit threshold, the problem admits\nminimizers of arbitrarily large mass, which contrasts with the usual case of\nRiesz potentials. In addition, we prove that, any sequence of minimizers\nconverges to the ball as the mass goes to infinity. Finally, we study the\nstability of the ball, and show that our threshold on the first moment of the\nkernels is sharp in the sense that large balls go from stable to unstable. A\ndirect consequence of the instability of large balls above this threshold is\nthat there exist nontrivial compactly supported kernels for which the problems\nadmit minimizers which are not balls, that is, symmetry breaking occurs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 2020 19:55:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2020 21:05:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 3 May 2021 12:41:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-04"}

Apart from facilitating gas accretion on to the central\nprotostar, it must also impact on the process of planet formation: directly\nthrough fragmentation, and indirectly through the turbulent concentration of\nsmall solids. To understand the latter process, it is essential to determine\nthe dust dynamics in such a turbulent flow. For that purpose, we conduct a\nseries of 3D shearing box simulations of coupled gas and dust, including the\ngas's self-gravity and scanning a range of Stokes numbers, from 0.001 to ~0.2.\nFirst, we show that the vertical settling of dust in the midplane is\nsignificantly impeded by gravitoturbulence, with the dust scale-height roughly\n0.6 times the gas scale height for centimetre grains. This is a result of the\nstrong vertical diffusion issuing from (a) small-scale inertial-wave turbulence\nfeeding off the GI spiral waves and (b) the larger-scale vertical circulations\nthat naturally accompany the spirals. Second, we show that at R=50 AU\nconcentration events involving sub-metre particles and yielding order 1 dust to\ngas ratios are rare and last for less than an orbit. Moreover, dust\nconcentration is less efficient in 3D than in 2D simulations. We conclude that\nGI is not especially prone to the turbulent accumulation of dust grains.\nFinally, the large dust scale-height measured in simulations could be, in the\nfuture, compared with that of edge-on discs seen by ALMA, thus aiding detection\nand characterisation of GI in real systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 2020 20:03:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-11"}

The deep\nlearning model aims to jointly learn the nonlinear time marching operator and\nthe effects of the unknown parameters from a time series dataset. We assume\nthat the time series data set consists of an ensemble of trajectories for a\nrange of the parameters. The learning task is formulated as a statistical\ninference problem by considering the unknown parameters as random variables. A\nlatent variable is introduced to model the effects of the unknown parameters,\nand a variational inference method is employed to simultaneously train\nprobabilistic models for the time marching operator and an approximate\nposterior distribution for the latent variable. Unlike the classical\nvariational inference, where a factorized distribution is used to approximate\nthe posterior, we employ a feedforward neural network supplemented by an\nencoder recurrent neural network to develop a more flexible probabilistic\nmodel. The approximate posterior distribution makes an inference on a\ntrajectory to identify the effects of the unknown parameters. The time marching\noperator is approximated by a recurrent neural network, which takes a latent\nstate sampled from the approximate posterior distribution as one of the input\nvariables, to compute the time evolution of the probability distribution\nconditioned on the latent variable. In the numerical experiments, it is shown\nthat the proposed variational inference model makes a more accurate simulation\ncompared to the standard recurrent neural networks. It is found that the\nproposed deep learning model is capable of correctly identifying the dimensions\nof the random parameters and learning a representation of complex time series\ndata.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 2020 20:57:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Feb 2021 17:20:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-01"}

In this paper, we\npropose computational techniques for Bayesian estimation of GSHS. In\nparticular, the Fokker-Planck equation that describes the evolution of\nuncertainty distributions along GSHS is solved by spectral techniques, where an\narbitrary form of probability density of the hybrid state is represented by a\nmixture of Fourier series. The method is based on splitting the Fokker-Planck\nequation represented by an integro-partial differential equation into the\npartial differentiation part for continuous diffusion and the integral part for\ndiscrete transition, and integrating the solution of each part. The propagated\ndensity function is used with a likelihood function in the Bayes' formula to\nestimate the hybrid state for given sensor measurements. The unique feature of\nthe proposed technique is that the probability density describing complete\nstochastic properties of the hybrid state is constructed without relying on the\ncommon Gaussian assumption, in contrast to other methods that compute certain\nexpected values such as mean or variance. We apply the proposed method to the\nestimation of two examples: the bouncing ball model and the Dubins vehicle\nmodel.

Principal technical advances relate to efficient\nfree-space coupling of light to and from guided modes of PCWs, silicate bonding\nof silicon chips within small glass vacuum cells, and deterministic, mechanical\ndelivery of single-atom tweezer arrays to the near fields of photonic crystal\nwaveguides.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 2020 22:45:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-04"}

We investigate their properties in comparison\nwith the isolated Schwarzschild black hole. Due to the influence of the\nexternal matter the vertical epicyclic frequency is not always positive\nanymore, and the stability of the circular orbits is determined by the\ninterplay between both of the frequencies. As a result, the stable circular\norbits do not extend to infinity, but are confined to a finite annular region\nbetween an inner and an outer marginally stable orbit. In addition, the\ndegeneracy between the vertical epicyclic and the orbital frequency, which is\ncharacteristic for the Schwarzschild solution, is broken, and there are regions\nin the parametric space where the radial epicyclic frequency is larger than the\nvertical one. All these properties allow for much more diverse types of\nnon-linear resonances to be excited than for the isolated Schwarzschild black\nhole, which can provide an explanation for the observed 3:2 ratio between the\ntwin-peak frequencies of the quasi-periodic oscillations from the accretion\ndisk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 2020 23:47:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-16"}

For rapid\nconversions, the discontinuity $g$-mode has zero frequency because a displaced\nfluid element near the phase splitting surface adjusts almost immediately its\ncomposition to its surroundings and gravity cannot provide a buoyancy force.\nFor slow conversions, a $g$-mode exists and its properties are analysed here\nusing modern hadronic and quark equations of state.

However, it remains an open question whether it is\nnecessary and/or sufficient for deep neural networks (DNNs) to learn class\nselectivity in individual units.

For ResNet20 trained on CIFAR10 we could reduce class\nselectivity by a factor of 2.5 with no impact on test accuracy, and reduce it\nnearly to zero with only a small ($\\sim$2%) drop in test accuracy. In contrast,\nregularizing to increase class selectivity significantly decreased test\naccuracy across all models and datasets.

We propose a quantitative semantics to measure the\ndegree of violation of a data invariant, and establish that strong data\ninvariants can be constructed from observations with low variance on the given\ndataset. A concrete instance of this principle gives the surprising result that\nlow-variance components of a principal component analysis (PCA), which are\nusually discarded, generate better invariants than the high-variance\ncomponents. We demonstrate the value of data invariants on two applications:\ntrusted machine learning and data drift. We empirically show that data\ninvariants can (1) reliably detect tuples on which the prediction of a\nmachine-learned model should not be trusted, and (2) quantify data drift more\naccurately than the state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we show four case\nstudies where an intervention-centric explanation tool uses data invariants to\nexplain causes for tuple non-conformance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 2020 01:40:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Mar 2020 18:43:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 5 Mar 2020 02:59:03 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2021 05:22:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-05"}

In\nparticular, IRS is built by passive and programmable electromagnetic elements\nthat can manipulate the mmWave propagation channel into a more favorable\ncondition that is free of blockage via judicious joint BS-IRS transmission\ndesign. However, the coexistence of IRSs and mmWave BSs complicates the network\narchitecture, and thus poses great challenges for efficient beam management\n(BM) that is one critical prerequisite for high performance mmWave networks. In\nthis paper, we systematically evaluate the key issues and challenges of BM for\nIRS-assisted mmWave networks to bring insights into the future network design.\nSpecifically, we carefully classify and discuss the extensibility and\nlimitations of the existing BM of conventional mmWave towards the IRS-assisted\nnew paradigm.

In grant-free\nNOMA, pilot signals are often used for user activity detection (UAD) and\nchannel estimation (CE) prior to multiuser detection (MUD) of active users.\nHowever, the pilot overhead makes the communications inefficient for IoT\ndevices with sporadic transmissions and short data packets, or when the channel\ncoherence time is short. Hence, it is desirable to improve the efficiency by\navoiding the use of pilot signals, which can also further achieve lower\nlatency. This work focuses on Bayesian receiver design for grant-free low\ndensity signature orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (LDS-OFDM), where\neach user is allocated a unique low density spreading sequence. We propose to\nuse the low density spreading sequences for active user detection, thereby\navoiding the use of pilot signals. Firstly, the task of joint UAD, CE and MUD\nis formulated as a structured signal estimation problem. Then message passing\nbased Bayesian approach is developed to solve the structured signal estimation\nproblem. In particular, belief propagation (BP), expectation propagation (EP)\nand mean field (MF) message passing are used to develop efficient hybrid\nmessage passing algorithms to achieve trade-off between performance and\ncomplexity.

Existing work on trajectory clustering often relies on\nsimilarity measurements that utilize raw spatial and/or temporal information of\ntrajectories. These measures are incapable of identifying similar moving\nbehaviors that exhibit varying spatio-temporal scales of movement. In addition,\nthe expense of labeling massive trajectory data is a barrier to supervised\nlearning models. To address these challenges, we propose an unsupervised neural\napproach for mobility behavior clustering, called the Deep Embedded TrajEctory\nClusTering network (DETECT). DETECT operates in three parts: first it\ntransforms the trajectories by summarizing their critical parts and augmenting\nthem with context derived from their geographical locality (e.g., using POIs\nfrom gazetteers). In the second part, it learns a powerful representation of\ntrajectories in the latent space of behaviors, thus enabling a clustering\nfunction (such as $k$-means) to be applied. Finally, a clustering oriented loss\nis directly built on the embedded features to jointly perform feature\nrefinement and cluster assignment, thus improving separability between mobility\nbehaviors. Exhaustive quantitative and qualitative experiments on two\nreal-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for mobility\nbehavior analyses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 2020 06:09:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-04"}

It achieves this by using the photometric\nerrors between the target view and the synthesized views from its adjacent\nsource views as the loss. Despite significant progress, the learning still\nsuffers from occlusion and scene dynamics. This paper shows that carefully\nmanipulating photometric errors can tackle these difficulties better. The\nprimary improvement is achieved by a statistical technique that can mask out\nthe invisible or nonstationary pixels in the photometric error map and thus\nprevents misleading the networks. With this outlier masking approach, the depth\nof objects moving in the opposite direction to the camera can be estimated more\naccurately. To the best of our knowledge, such scenarios have not been\nseriously considered in the previous works, even though they pose a higher risk\nin applications like autonomous driving.

In this paper, we propose an elegant curriculum based scheme that\nsmoothes the feature embedding of a CNN using anti-aliasing or low-pass\nfilters. We propose to augment the train-ing of CNNs by controlling the amount\nof high frequency information propagated within the CNNs as training\nprogresses, by convolving the output of a CNN feature map of each layer with a\nGaussian kernel.

There are two essential characteristics of filled CNT relevant for\napplication in electrochemical energy storage: (1) rigid hollow cavities of the\nCNT provide upper limits for nanoparticles in their inner cavities which are\nboth separated from the fillings of other CNT and protected against\ndegradation. In particular, the CNT shells resist strong volume changes of\nencapsulates in response to electrochemical cycling, which in conventional\nconversion and alloying materials hinders application in energy storage\ndevices. (2) Carbon mantles ensure electrical contact to the active material as\nthey are unaffected by potential cracks of the encapsulate and form a stable\nconductive network in the electrode compound.

OPOs\nrequire states with well-defined symmetries and energies: the fine-tuning of\nmaterial properties and structural dimensions to create these states remains a\nchallenge for the realization of scalable OPO-based functionalities in\nsemiconductor nanostructures. Here, we demonstrate a pathway towards this goal\nbased on the control of confined microcavity exciton-polaritons modulated by\nthe spatially and time varying dynamical potentials produced by a surface\nacoustic waves (SAW). The exciton-polariton are confined in um-sized\nintra-cavity traps fabricated by structuring a planar semiconductor microcavity\nduring the epitaxial growth process. OPOs in these structures benefit from the\nenhanced non-linearities of confined systems. We show that SAW fields induce\nstate-dependent and time-varying energy shifts, which enable the energy\nalignment of the confined levels with the appropriate symmetry for OPO\ntriggering. Furthermore, the dynamic acoustic tuning, which is fully described\nby a theoretical model for the modulation of the confined polaritons by the\nacoustic field, compensates for fluctuations in symmetry and dimensions of the\nconfinement potential thus enabling a variety of dynamic OPO regimes. The\nrobustness of the acoustic tuning is demonstrated by the synchronous excitation\nof an array of confined OPOs using a single acoustic beam, thus opening the way\nfor the realization of scalable non-linear on-chip systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 2020 08:22:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-04"}

Sperm-cell detection in a densely populated bull semen\nmicroscopic observation video presents challenges such as partial occlusion,\nvast number of objects in a single video frame, tiny size of the object,\nartifacts, low contrast, and blurry objects because of the rapid movement of\nthe sperm cells. This study proposes an architecture, called DeepSperm, that\nsolves the aforementioned challenges and is more accurate and faster than\nstate-of-the-art architectures. Methods: In the proposed architecture, we use\nonly one detection layer, which is specific for small object detection. For\nhandling overfitting and increasing accuracy, we set a higher network\nresolution, use a dropout layer, and perform data augmentation on hue,\nsaturation, and exposure. Several hyper-parameters are tuned to achieve better\nperformance. We compare our proposed method with those of a conventional image\nprocessing-based object-detection method, you only look once (YOLOv3), and mask\nregion-based convolutional neural network (Mask R-CNN). Results: In our\nexperiment, we achieve 86.91 mAP on the test dataset and a processing speed of\n50.3 fps. In comparison with YOLOv3, we achieve an increase of 16.66 mAP point,\n3.26 x faster on testing, and 1.4 x faster on training with a small training\ndataset, which contains 40 video frames.

In such context, they take a simplified form\nthat is not adapted to the problems considered here, in which the data fields\nare non-negative but with a sum not necessarily equal to one. In a systematic\nway, we reconsider the classical divergences and we give their forms adapted to\ninverse problems. To this end, we will recall the methods allowing to build\nsuch divergences, and propose some generalizations. The resolution of inverse\nproblems implies systematically the minimisation of a divergence between\nphysical measurements and a model depending of the unknown parameters. In the\ncontext image reconstruction, the model is generally linear and the constraints\nthat must be taken into account are the non-negativity as well as (if\nnecessary) the sum constraint of the unknown parameters. To take into account\nin a simple way the sum constraint, we introduce the class of scale invariant\nor affine invariant divergences. Such divergences remains unchanged when the\nmodel parameters are multiplied by a constant positive factor. We show the\ngeneral properties of the invariance factors, and we give some interesting\ncharacteristics of such divergences.An extension of such divergences allows to\nobtain the property of invariance with respect to both the arguments of the\ndivergences; this characteristic can be used to introduce the smoothness\nregularization of inverse problems, that is a regularisation in the sense of\nTikhonov.We then develop in a last step, minimisation methods of the\ndivergences subject to non-negativity and sum constraints on the solution\ncomponents.

The emission-line responses\ninhabit the interior of a virial envelope. The velocity-delay maps reveal\nstratified ionization structure. The HeII response inside 5-10 light-days has a\nbroad single-peaked velocity profile. The Ly_alpha, CIV, and H_beta responses\npeak inside 10 light-days, extend outside 20 light-days, and exhibit a velocity\nprofile with two peaks separated by 5000 km/s in the 10 to 20 light-day delay\nrange. The velocity-delay maps show that the M-shaped lag vs velocity structure\nfound in previous cross-correlation analysis is the signature of a Keplerian\ndisk with a well-defined outer edge at R=20 light-days. The outer wings of the\nM arise from the virial envelope, and the U-shaped interior of the M is the\nlower half of an ellipse in the velocity-delay plane. The far-side response is\nweaker than that from the near side, so that we see clearly the lower half, but\nonly faintly the upper half, of the velocity--delay ellipse. The delay\ntau=(R/c)(1-sin(i))=5 light-days at line center is from the near edge of the\ninclined ring, giving the inclination i=45 deg. A black hole mass of M=7x10^7\nMsun is consistent with the velocity-delay structure. A barber-pole pattern\nwith stripes moving from red to blue across the CIV and possibly Ly_alpha line\nprofiles suggests the presence of azimuthal structure rotating around the far\nside of the broad-line region and may be the signature of precession or orbital\nmotion of structures in the inner disk. Further HST observations of NGC 5548\nover a multi-year timespan but with a cadence of perhaps 10 days rather than 1\nday could help to clarify the nature of this new AGN phenomenon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 2020 11:02:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Nov 2020 10:04:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-10"}

The interstellar medium is affected by turbulence and observed H i\nstructures in channel maps are shaped by turbulent motions. It is taken for\ngranted by a few theoreticians that observed H i structures do not represent\nreal density enhancement but velocity caustics, caused by velocity crowding.\nThis interpretation was questioned and objections by Clark et al. led to\nviolent debates. Aims. To settle the discussion we verify theoretical key\nparameters by using Effelsberg Bonn H i Survey (EBHIS) observations. Methods.\nWe apply unsharp masking to determine filamentary H i structures at high\nspatial frequencies. In addition we use Gaussian parameters to distinguish the\ncold neutral medium (CNM) from observed H i column densities. We compare power\nspectra and spatial distributions of dust and H i column densities,\ndistinguishing CNM and multiphase column densities at various velocity widths.\nResults. Observations contradict the Velocity Channel Analysis (VCA) postulate\nthat the spectral index should steepen with the width of the velocity window.\nWe rather find that the thin slice spectral index depends strongly on the H i\nphase composition. Multiphase power spectra are steeper for regions with cold\ngas. VCA denies such H i phase dependencies on the power distribution.\nSeparating the CNM we find that the power spectra are significantly flatter\nthan those for the multiphase H i composite. We observe excess CNM power for\nsmall scale structures originating from cold dust bearing filaments that are\nembedded in the CNM. Spectral indices for narrow channel widths depend on the\nDoppler temperature of the H i gas. In presence of enhanced small scale H i\nstructure the far infrared emission from dust is also enhanced. Conclusions.\nSmall scale cold filamentary H i structures are predominantly caused by density\nenhancements due to phase transitions rather than by velocity caustics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 2020 11:08:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 2 Jan 2021 13:16:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-05"}

Processing of such 3D inputs is an\nincreasingly important problem as they are the output of 3D scanners, which are\nbecoming more accessible, and are the intermediate output of 3D computer vision\nalgorithms. Recently, learned implicit functions have shown great promise as\nthey produce continuous reconstructions. However, we identified two limitations\nin reconstruction from 3D inputs: 1) details present in the input data are not\nretained, and 2) poor reconstruction of articulated humans. To solve this, we\npropose Implicit Feature Networks (IF-Nets), which deliver continuous outputs,\ncan handle multiple topologies, and complete shapes for missing or sparse input\ndata retaining the nice properties of recent learned implicit functions, but\ncritically they can also retain detail when it is present in the input data,\nand can reconstruct articulated humans. Our work differs from prior work in two\ncrucial aspects. First, instead of using a single vector to encode a 3D shape,\nwe extract a learnable 3-dimensional multi-scale tensor of deep features, which\nis aligned with the original Euclidean space embedding the shape. Second,\ninstead of classifying x-y-z point coordinates directly, we classify deep\nfeatures extracted from the tensor at a continuous query point. We show that\nthis forces our model to make decisions based on global and local shape\nstructure, as opposed to point coordinates, which are arbitrary under Euclidean\ntransformations. Experiments demonstrate that IF-Nets clearly outperform prior\nwork in 3D object reconstruction in ShapeNet, and obtain significantly more\naccurate 3D human reconstructions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 2020 11:14:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Apr 2020 14:47:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-16"}

Especially important to the interaction performances is the online\nadaptation of body dynamics, which can be modeled as an impedance behaviour.\nHowever, the variable impedance controller still possesses a challenge in the\ncurrent control frameworks due to the difficulties of retaining stability when\nadapting the controller gains. The fractal impedance controller has been\nrecently proposed to solve this issue. However, it still has limitations such\nas sudden jumps in force when it starts to converge to the desired position and\nthe lack of a force feedback loop. In this manuscript, two improvements are\nmade to the control framework to solve these limitations. The force\ndiscontinuity has been addressed introducing a modulation of the impedance via\na virtual antagonist that modulates the output force. The force tracking has\nbeen modeled after the parallel force/position controller architecture. In\ncontrast to traditional methods, the fractal impedance controller enables the\nimplementation of a search algorithm on the force feedback to adapt its\nbehaviour on the external environment instead of on relying on \\textit{a\npriori} knowledge of the external dynamics. Preliminary simulation results\npresented in this paper show the feasibility of the proposed approach, and it\nallows to evaluate the trade-off that needs to be made when relying on the\nproposed controller for interaction.

An integral part of the models is the time\nseries representation using patterns of time series sequences.

For ground mobile robots, the\nintroduction of a wheel speed sensor can solve the scale weak-visible problem\nand improve the robustness under abnormal conditions. In this thesis, a\nmulti-sensor fusion SLAM algorithm using monocular vision, inertia, and wheel\nspeed measurements is proposed. The sensor measurements are combined in a\ntightly coupled manner, and a nonlinear optimization method is used to maximize\nthe posterior probability to solve the optimal state estimation. Loop detection\nand back-end optimization are added to help reduce or even eliminate the\ncumulative error of the estimated poses, thus ensuring global consistency of\nthe trajectory and map.

Next,\nwe establish a necessary condition for solvability of the FDI problem for\nlinear structured systems. In addition, we develop a sufficient algebraic\ncondition for solvability of the FDI problem in terms of a rank test on an\nassociated pattern matrix. To illustrate that this condition is not necessary,\nwe provide a counterexample in which the FDI problem is solvable while the\ncondition is not satisfied. Finally, we develop a graph-theoretic condition for\nthe full rank property of a given pattern matrix, which leads to a\ngraph-theoretic condition for solvability of the FDI problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 2020 13:38:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-04"}

To date, most studies of second-order NLO processes focus on\nmaterials with broken spatial inversion symmetry, such as proper ferroelectrics\nand noncentrosymmetric Weyl semimetals. Nevertheless, inversion symmetry of\nShubnikov groups can be broken via spin-ordering in centrosymmetric crystals.\nUnfortunately, these materials are less common, and their NLO responses are\nusually weak. Combining quantum perturbation theory and first-principles\nsimulations, we predict a giant injection-current photogalvanic effect and SHG\nin a family of emerging axion insulators, the even septuple layers of MnBi2Te4\n(MBT) materials that exhibit the zero-plateau quantum anomalous Hall (QAH)\neffect. Their amplitudes of injection current and SHG are about two orders of\nmagnitude larger than those of widely used ferroelectrics, such as BiFeO3 and\nLiNbO3. Moreover, unlike the usual injection current observed under\ncircularly-polarized light, the injection photocurrent of MBTs only emerges\nunder linearly polarized light, making it convenient for device applications.\nThese unique characters are from a combination effect of parity-time symmetry,\nthree-fold rotation symmetry, and significant spin-orbit coupling.

The focus of this study is to evaluate the input activity representation\nof these feed-forward neural networks. The activity of cerebellar granule cells\nis conveyed by parallel fibers and translated into Purkinje cell activity; the\nsole output of the cerebellar cortex. The learning process at this\nparallel-fiber-to-Purkinje-cell connection makes each Purkinje cell sensitive\nto a set of specific cerebellar states, determined by the granule-cell activity\nduring a certain time window. A Purkinje cell becomes sensitive to each neural\ninput state and, consequently, the network operates as a function able to\ngenerate a desired output for each provided input by means of supervised\nlearning. However, not all sets of Purkinje cell responses can be assigned to\nany set of input states due to the network's own limitations (inherent to the\nnetwork neurobiological substrate), that is, not all input-output mapping can\nbe learned. A limiting factor is the representation of the input states through\ngranule-cell activity. The quality of this representation will determine the\ncapacity of the network to learn a varied set of outputs. In this study we\npresent an algorithm for evaluating quantitatively the level of\ncompatibility/interference amongst a set of given cerebellar states according\nto their representation (granule-cell activation patterns) without the need for\nactually conducting simulations and network training. The algorithm input\nconsists of a real-number matrix that codifies the activity level of every\nconsidered granule-cell in each state.

We investigate the\neffect of randomized smoothing on the feasible hypotheses space, and show that\nfor some noise levels the set of hypotheses which are feasible shrinks due to\nsmoothing, giving one reason why the natural accuracy drops after smoothing. To\nperform our analysis, we introduce a model for randomized smoothing which\nabstracts away specifics, such as the exact distribution of the noise.

To fill this gap and facilitate related research,\nthis paper provides a new yet convenient way to extract the interactive\nbehavior data (i.e., the trajectories of vehicles and humans) from actual\naccident videos that were captured by both the surveillance cameras and driving\nrecorders. The main challenge for data extraction from real-time accident video\nlies in the fact that the recording cameras are un-calibrated and the angles of\nsurveillance are unknown.

In addition to ranking top 1 in the challenge, the proposed model\noutperforms all previous models, including state-of-the-art hierarchy-based\nmodels, on two large-scale public multi-turn response selection benchmark\ndatasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 2020 04:36:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-05"}

This type of HTS magnet offers attractive features via its simplicity,\nrobustness, and is well-suited for modest size steady-state applications such\nas a mid-scale stellarator. In non-planar coil applications the HTS tape may be\nsubject to severe minor-axis bending strain ($\\epsilon_{bend}$), torsional\nstrains ($\\epsilon_{tor}$) and transverse magnetic field components\n($B_\\perp$), all of which can limit the magnet operating space. A novel method\nof winding angle optimization is here presented to overcome these limitations.\nEssentially, this method: 1) calculates the peak {\\epsilon}bend and B\\perp for\narbitary winding angle along an input coil filamentary trajectory, 2) defines a\ncost function including both, and then 3) uses tensioned splines to define a\nwinding angle that reduces $\\epsilon$tor and optimizes the {\\epsilon}bend and\n$B_\\perp$ cost function. As strain limits are present even without $B_\\perp$,\nthis optimization is able to provide an assessment of the minimimum buildable\nsize of an arbitrary non-planar non-insulating HTS coil. This optimization\nfinds that for standard 4 mm wide HTS tapes the minimum size coils of the\nexisting HSX, NCSX, and W7-X stellarator geometries are around 0.3 - 0.5 m in\nradius. For coils larger than this size, permitting a finite (yet tolerable)\nstrain allows reduction of $B_\\perp$. This enables a reduction of the HTS tape\nlength required to achieve a given design magnetic field or equivalently an\nincrease in the achievable magnetic field for fixed HTS tape length. The\ndistinct considerations for optimizing a stellarator coilset to further ease\ncompatibility with non-insulated HTS magnets are also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 2020 15:34:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-28"}

When it comes to AI/ML for data communication\nNetworks (AI4NETS), and despite the many attempts to turn networks into\nlearning agents, the successful application of AI/ML in networking is limited.\nThere is a strong resistance against AI/ML-based solutions, and a striking gap\nbetween the extensive academic research and the actual deployments of such\nAI/ML-based systems in operational environments. The truth is, there are still\nmany unsolved complex challenges associated to the analysis of networking data\nthrough AI/ML, which hinders its acceptability and adoption in the practice. In\nthis positioning paper I elaborate on the most important show-stoppers in\nAI4NETS, and present a research agenda to tackle some of these challenges,\nenabling a natural adoption of AI/ML for networking. In particular, I focus the\nfuture research in AI4NETS around three major pillars: (i) to make AI/ML\nimmediately applicable in networking problems through the concepts of effective\nlearning, turning it into a useful and reliable way to deal with complex\ndata-driven networking problems; (ii) to boost the adoption of AI/ML at the\nlarge scale by learning from the Internet-paradigm itself, conceiving novel\ndistributed and hierarchical learning approaches mimicking the distributed\ntopological principles and operation of the Internet itself; and (iii) to\nexploit the softwarization and distribution of networks to conceive\nAI/ML-defined Networks (AIDN), relying on the distributed generation and\nre-usage of knowledge through novel Knowledge Delivery Networks (KDNs).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 2020 00:36:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-11"}

To\nimprove the interpretability in the dual encoder models, we design a novel\nregularization loss to minimize the mutual information between unimportant\nwords and desired labels, in addition to the original attention method, so that\nimportant words are emphasized while unimportant words are de-emphasized.

Specifically, the numerical studies show\nthat the traffic congestion can be reduced by up to a factor of four, while the\naverage flow speeds of CAV group remains closer to the speed limits and can be\nup to 300% greater than the human-driven vehicles. Finally, traffic situations\nare also studied, indicating that even a small market penetration of CAVs will\nhave a substantial net positive effect on the traffic flows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 2020 22:47:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-05"}

An alternative\napproach to deposit different two-dimensional materials is by inkjet\nprinting4-7. Here we show the fabrication of a nanosheet supercapacitor by\ninkjet printing Ti3C2Tx MXene nanosheets as electrodes, and graphene oxide\nnanosheets as solid-state electrolyte. The free water molecules trapped between\ngraphene oxide sheets facilitate proton movement through the layered solid\nelectrolyte8. The as-made supercapacitor shows high areal capacitance, good\ncycling stability and high areal energy and power densities comparable with\nexisting printed supercapacitors. Moreover, the specific capacitance can be\nincreased further by addition of liquid electrolytes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Mar 2020 14:54:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-19"}
