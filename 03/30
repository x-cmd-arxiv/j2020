In this paper, we propose a deep face super-resolution (FSR)\nmethod with iterative collaboration between two recurrent networks which focus\non facial image recovery and landmark estimation respectively. In each\nrecurrent step, the recovery branch utilizes the prior knowledge of landmarks\nto yield higher-quality images which facilitate more accurate landmark\nestimation in turn. Therefore, the iterative information interaction between\ntwo processes boosts the performance of each other progressively. Moreover, a\nnew attentive fusion module is designed to strengthen the guidance of landmark\nmaps, where facial components are generated individually and aggregated\nattentively for better restoration.

The first problem was found\nby (Bravyi and Terhal, SIAM Journal of Computing 2009); it was then followed by\n(Crosson, Bacon and Brown, PRE 2010) and (Bravyi, Quantum Information and\nComputation 2015). Surprisingly, two of these problems are defined using\nterminology from quantum computation, while the third is inspired by quantum\ncomputation and keeps a physical terminology. This prevents classical\ncomplexity theorists from studying these problems, delaying potential progress,\ne.g., on the NP vs. MA question.\n  Here, we define two new combinatorial problems and prove their\nMA-completeness. The first problem, ACAC, gets as input a succinctly described\ngraph, with some marked vertices. The problem is to decide whether there is a\nconnected component with only unmarked vertices, or the graph is far from\nhaving this property. The second problem, SetCSP, generalizes standard\nconstraint satisfaction problem (CSP) into constraints involving sets of\nstrings.\n  Technically, our proof that SetCSP is MA-complete is based on an observation\nby (Aharonov and Grilo, FOCS 2019), in which it was noted that a restricted\ncase of Bravyi and Terhal's problem (namely, the uniform case) is already\nMA-complete; a simple trick allows to state this restricted case using\ncombinatorial language. The fact that the first, more natural, problem of ACAC\nis MA-hard follows quite naturally from this proof, while the containment of\nACAC in MA is based on the theory of random walks.\n  We notice that the main result of Aharonov and Grilo carries over to the\nSetCSP problem in a straightforward way, implying that finding a\ngap-amplification procedure for SetCSP (as in Dinur's PCP proof) is equivalent\nto MA=NP. This provides an alternative new path towards the major problem of\nderandomizing MA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Mar 2020 16:21:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Sep 2020 14:37:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 6 Jan 2021 11:31:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-07"}

However, scalable platooning operations require junction-level\ncoordination, which has not been well studied. In this paper, we study the\ncoordination of vehicle platooning at highway junctions. We consider a setting\nwhere CAVs randomly arrive at a highway junction according to a general renewal\nprocess. When a CAV approaches the junction, a system operator determines\nwhether the CAV will merge into the platoon ahead according to the positions\nand speeds of the CAV and the platoon. We formulate a Markov decision process\nto minimize the discounted cumulative travel cost, i.e. fuel consumption plus\ntravel delay, over an infinite time horizon. We show that the optimal policy is\nthreshold-based: the CAV will merge with the platoon if and only if the\ndifference between the CAV's and the platoon's predicted times of arrival at\nthe junction is less than a constant threshold. We also propose two\nready-to-implement algorithms to derive the optimal policy. Comparison with the\nclassical value iteration algorithm implies that our approach explicitly\nincorporating the characteristics of the optimal policy is significantly more\nefficient in terms of computation. Importantly, we show that the optimal policy\nunder Poisson arrivals can be obtained by solving a system of integral\nequations.

Doing this early would save millions of lives and help\ncountries keep a stable economy. The easiest way to control the spread of a\nvirus is to immediately inform the individuals who recently had close contact\nwith the diagnosed patients. However, to achieve this, a centralized authority\n(e.g., a health authority) needs detailed location information from both\nhealthy individuals and diagnosed patients. Thus, such an approach, although\nbeneficial to control the spread of a virus, results in serious privacy\nconcerns, and hence privacy-preserving solutions are required to solve this\nproblem. Previous works on this topic either (i) compromise privacy (especially\nprivacy of diagnosed patients) to have better efficiency or (ii) provide\nunscalable solutions. In this work, we propose a technique based on private set\nintersection between physical contact histories of individuals (that are\nrecorded using smart phones) and a centralized database (run by a health\nauthority) that keeps the identities of the positive diagnosed patients for the\ndisease. Proposed solution protects the location privacy of both healthy\nindividuals and diagnosed patients and it guarantees that the identities of the\ndiagnosed patients remain hidden from other individuals. Notably, proposed\nscheme allows individuals to receive warning messages indicating their previous\ncontacts with a positive diagnosed patient. Such warning messages will help\nthem realize the risk and isolate themselves from other people. We make sure\nthat the warning messages are only observed by the corresponding individuals\nand not by the health authority. We also implement the proposed scheme and show\nits efficiency and scalability via simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Mar 2020 16:54:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Oct 2020 15:29:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-26"}

The main idea of GP-MVC lies at two-fold. First,\nmulti-view encoder networks are trained to learn common low-dimensional\nrepresentations, followed by a clustering layer to capture the consistent\ncluster structure across multiple views. Second, view-specific generative\nadversarial networks are developed to generate the missing data of one view\nconditioning on the shared representation given by other views. These two steps\ncould be promoted mutually, where learning common representations facilitates\ndata imputation and the generated data could further explores the view\nconsistency.

Given an estimate for the\nnoise level a common convex approach to recover the signal is basis pursuit\ndenoising. If the measurement matrix has the robust null space property with\nrespect to the $\\ell_2$-norm, basis pursuit denoising obeys stable and robust\nrecovery guarantees.

However, if the\nmeasurement matrix is the biadjacency matrix of a random left regular bipartite\ngraph it obeys with a high probability the null space property with respect to\nthe $\\ell_1$-norm with optimal parameters. Therefore, we discuss non-negative\nleast absolute deviation (NNLAD). For these measurement matrices, we prove a\nuniform, stable and robust recovery guarantee without the need for tuning.

In this\npaper, we propose a novel high-order residual network to learn the geometric\nfeatures hierarchically from the LF for reconstruction. An important component\nin the proposed network is the high-order residual block (HRB), which learns\nthe local geometric features by considering the information from all input\nviews. After fully obtaining the local features learned from each HRB, our\nmodel extracts the representative geometric features for spatio-angular\nupsampling through the global residual learning. Additionally, a refinement\nnetwork is followed to further enhance the spatial details by minimizing a\nperceptual loss.

In a complex\nenvironment, it is necessary to fuse different localization modules to obtain\nmore robust results, in which the error model plays a paramount role. However,\nexteroceptive sensor-based odometries (ESOs), such as LiDAR/visual odometry,\noften deliver results with scene-related error, which is difficult to model\naccurately. To address this problem, this research designs a scene-aware error\nmodel for ESO, based on which a multimodal localization fusion framework is\ndeveloped. In addition, an end-to-end learning method is proposed to train this\nerror model using sparse global poses such as GPS/IMU results. The proposed\nmethod is realized for error modeling of LiDAR/visual odometry, and the results\nare fused with dead reckoning to examine the performance of vehicle\nlocalization. Experiments are conducted using both simulation and real-world\ndata of experienced and unexperienced environments, and the experimental\nresults demonstrate that with the learned scene-aware error models, vehicle\nlocalization accuracy can be largely improved and shows adaptiveness in\nunexperienced scenes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Mar 2020 18:50:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-31"}

In some circumstances, the\ntest's performance and its discriminatory ability may vary according to\nsubject-specific characteristics or different test settings. In such cases,\ninformation-specific accuracy measures, such as the covariate-specific and the\ncovariate-adjusted ROC curve are needed, as ignoring covariate information may\nlead to biased or erroneous results. This paper introduces the R package\nROCnReg that allows estimating the pooled (unadjusted) ROC curve, the\ncovariate-specific ROC curve, and the covariate-adjusted ROC curve by different\nmethods, both from (semi) parametric and nonparametric perspectives and within\nBayesian and frequentist paradigms. From the estimated ROC curve (pooled,\ncovariate-specific or covariate-adjusted), several summary measures of\naccuracy, such as the (partial) area under the ROC curve and the Youden index,\ncan be obtained. The package also provides functions to obtain ROC-based\noptimal threshold values using several criteria, namely, the Youden Index\ncriterion and the criterion that sets a target value for the false positive\nfraction. For the Bayesian methods, we provide tools for assessing model fit\nvia posterior predictive checks, while model choice can be carried out via\nseveral information criteria. Numerical and graphical outputs are provided for\nall methods.

As the primary goal in topological data analysis is to define\nand quantify the shapes in numeric data, defining shapes in the text is much\nmore challenging, even though the geometries of vector spaces and conceptual\nspaces are clearly relevant for information retrieval and semantics. In this\npaper, we examine two different methods of extraction of topological features\nfrom text, using as the underlying representations of words the two most\npopular methods, namely word embeddings and TF-IDF vectors. To extract\ntopological features from the word embedding space, we interpret the embedding\nof a text document as high dimensional time series, and we analyze the topology\nof the underlying graph where the vertices correspond to different embedding\ndimensions. For topological data analysis with the TF-IDF representations, we\nanalyze the topology of the graph whose vertices come from the TF-IDF vectors\nof different blocks in the textual document. In both cases, we apply\nhomological persistence to reveal the geometric structures under different\ndistance resolutions. Our results show that these topological features carry\nsome exclusive information that is not captured by conventional text mining\nmethods. In our experiments we observe adding topological features to the\nconventional features in ensemble models improves the classification results\n(up to 5\\%). On the other hand, as expected, topological features by themselves\nmay be not sufficient for effective classification.

This question was\nfirst posed in 2004 by Karo\\'nski, {\\L}uczak and Thomason, who equivalently\nasked if one may assign weights $1,2,3$ to the edges of every such graph so\nthat adjacent vertices receive distinct weighted degrees - the sums of their\nincident weights. This basic problem is commonly referred to as the 1-2-3\nConjecture nowadays, and has been addressed in multiple papers. Thus far it is\nknown that weights $1,2,3,4,5$ are sufficient [J. Combin.

Here, we address the question of whether error-uncorrected\nnoisy quantum computers can provide computational advantage over classical\ncomputers. Specifically, we study noisy random circuit sampling in one\ndimension (or 1D noisy RCS) as a simple model for exploring the effects of\nnoise on the computational power of a noisy quantum device. In particular, we\nsimulate the real-time dynamics of 1D noisy random quantum circuits via matrix\nproduct operators (MPOs) and characterize the computational power of the 1D\nnoisy quantum system by using a metric we call MPO entanglement entropy. The\nlatter metric is chosen because it determines the cost of classical MPO\nsimulation. We numerically demonstrate that for the two-qubit gate error rates\nwe considered, there exists a characteristic system size above which adding\nmore qubits does not bring about an exponential growth of the cost of classical\nMPO simulation of 1D noisy systems. Specifically, we show that above the\ncharacteristic system size, there is an optimal circuit depth, independent of\nthe system size, where the MPO entanglement entropy is maximized. Most\nimportantly, the maximum achievable MPO entanglement entropy is bounded by a\nconstant that depends only on the gate error rate, not on the system size. We\nalso provide a heuristic analysis to get the scaling of the maximum achievable\nMPO entanglement entropy as a function of the gate error rate. The obtained\nscaling suggests that although the cost of MPO simulation does not increase\nexponentially in the system size above a certain characteristic system size, it\ndoes increase exponentially as the gate error rate decreases, possibly making\nclassical simulation practically not feasible even with state-of-the-art\nsupercomputers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Mar 2020 23:55:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 2020 20:22:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 8 Sep 2020 02:44:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-16"}

To get this result we study\nand exploit some structural properties of the Tukey levels (the regions $D_{\\ge\nk}$ consisting of points whose Tukey depth is at least $k$, for $k=0,1,...$).\nIn particular, we derive lower bounds on their volumes for point sets $S$ in\ngeneral position, and develop a rather subtle mechanism for handling point sets\n$S$ in degenerate position (where the deep Tukey regions have zero volume). A\nnaive approach to the construction of the Tukey regions requires $n^{O(d^2)}$\ntime. To reduce the cost to $O(n^d)$, we use an approximation scheme for\nestimating the volumes of the Tukey regions (within their affine spans in case\nof degeneracy), and for sampling a point from such a region, a scheme that is\nbased on the volume estimation framework of Lov\\'asz and Vempala (FOCS 2003)\nand of Cousins and Vempala (STOC 2015). Making this framework differentially\nprivate raises a set of technical challenges that we address.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Mar 2020 02:42:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-31"}

Nonetheless, massive supervision\nremains a luxury for many real applications, boosting great interest in\nlabel-scarce techniques such as few-shot learning (FSL), which aims to learn\nconcept of new classes with a few labeled samples. A natural approach to FSL is\ndata augmentation and many recent works have proved the feasibility by\nproposing various data synthesis models. However, these models fail to well\nsecure the discriminability and diversity of the synthesized data and thus\noften produce undesirable results. In this paper, we propose Adversarial\nFeature Hallucination Networks (AFHN) which is based on conditional Wasserstein\nGenerative Adversarial networks (cWGAN) and hallucinates diverse and\ndiscriminative features conditioned on the few labeled samples. Two novel\nregularizers, i.e., the classification regularizer and the anti-collapse\nregularizer, are incorporated into AFHN to encourage discriminability and\ndiversity of the synthesized features, respectively. Ablation study verifies\nthe effectiveness of the proposed cWGAN based feature hallucination framework\nand the proposed regularizers.

To\ninvolve the unlabelled data, most existing SSL methods are based on common\ndensity-based cluster assumption: samples lying in the same high-density region\nare likely to belong to the same class, including the methods performing\nconsistency regularization or generating pseudo-labels for the unlabelled\nimages. Despite their impressive performance, we argue three limitations exist:\n1) Though the density information is demonstrated to be an important clue, they\nall use it in an implicit way and have not exploited it in depth. 2) For\nfeature learning, they often learn the feature embedding based on the single\ndata sample and ignore the neighborhood information. 3) For label-propagation\nbased pseudo-label generation, it is often done offline and difficult to be\nend-to-end trained with feature learning. Motivated by these limitations, this\npaper proposes to solve the SSL problem by building a novel density-aware\ngraph, based on which the neighborhood information can be easily leveraged and\nthe feature learning and label propagation can also be trained in an end-to-end\nway. Specifically, we first propose a new Density-aware Neighborhood\nAggregation(DNA) module to learn more discriminative features by incorporating\nthe neighborhood information in a density-aware manner. Then a novel\nDensity-ascending Path based Label Propagation(DPLP) module is proposed to\ngenerate the pseudo-labels for unlabeled samples more efficiently according to\nthe feature distribution characterized by density. Finally, the DNA module and\nDPLP module evolve and improve each other end-to-end.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Mar 2020 02:52:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-31"}

In this paper, probabilistic caching is studied for\nultra-dense small-cell networks with terrestrial and aerial users, where a\ndynamic on-off architecture is adopted under a sophisticated path loss model\nincorporating both line-of-sight and non-line-of-sight transmissions.\nGenerally, this paper focuses on the successful download probability (SDP) of\nuser equipments (UEs) from small-cell base stations (SBSs) that cache the\nrequested files under various caching strategies. To be more specific, the SDP\nis first analyzed using stochastic geometry theory, by considering the\ndistribution of such two-tier UEs and SBSs as Homogeneous Poisson Point\nProcesses. Second, an optimized caching strategy (OCS) is proposed to maximize\nthe average SDP. Third, the performance limits of the average SDP are developed\nfor the popular caching strategy (PCS) and the uniform caching strategy (UCS).\nFinally, the impacts of the key parameters, such as the SBS density, the cache\nsize, the exponent of Zipf distribution and the height of aerial user, are\ninvestigated on the average SDP. The analytical results indicate that the UCS\noutperforms the PCS if the SBSs are sufficiently dense, while the PCS is better\nthan the UCS if the exponent of Zipf distribution is large enough.

If we apply a conventional clustering technique over the\ncombined dataset, then every time a new batch of data comes, the process can be\nslow and wasteful. Moreover, it can be challenging to store the combined\ndataset in memory due to its ever-increasing size. As a result, various\nincremental clustering techniques have been proposed. These techniques need to\nefficiently update the current clustering result whenever a new batch arrives,\nto adapt the current clustering result/solution with the latest data. These\ntechniques also need the ability to detect concept drifts when the clustering\npattern of a new batch is significantly different from older batches.\nSometimes, clustering patterns may drift temporarily in a single batch while\nthe next batches do not exhibit the drift. Therefore, incremental clustering\ntechniques need the ability to detect a temporary drift and sustained drift. In\nthis paper, we propose an efficient incremental clustering algorithm called\nUIClust. It is designed to cluster streams of data chunks, even when there are\ntemporary or sustained concept drifts. We evaluate the performance of UIClust\nby comparing it with a recently published, high-quality incremental clustering\nalgorithm. We use real and synthetic datasets.

Anomaly detection methods based on convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs) typically leverage proxy tasks, such as reconstructing\ninput video frames, to learn models describing normality without seeing\nanomalous samples at training time, and quantify the extent of abnormalities\nusing the reconstruction error at test time. The main drawbacks of these\napproaches are that they do not consider the diversity of normal patterns\nexplicitly, and the powerful representation capacity of CNNs allows to\nreconstruct abnormal video frames. To address this problem, we present an\nunsupervised learning approach to anomaly detection that considers the\ndiversity of normal patterns explicitly, while lessening the representation\ncapacity of CNNs.

Besides, this upper\nbound for the first nonzero Wentzell eigenvalue can be achieved if and only if\nthese two geodesic balls are isometric with each other. This conclusion can be\nseen as an extension of eigenvalue comparisons in [7,22].

However, DAT is still vulnerable in several aspects\nincluding (1) training instability due to the overwhelming discriminative\nability of the domain classifier in adversarial training, (2) restrictive\nfeature-level alignment, and (3) lack of interpretability or systematic\nexplanation of the learned feature space. In this paper, we propose a novel\nMax-margin Domain-Adversarial Training (MDAT) by designing an Adversarial\nReconstruction Network (ARN). The proposed MDAT stabilizes the gradient\nreversing in ARN by replacing the domain classifier with a reconstruction\nnetwork, and in this manner ARN conducts both feature-level and pixel-level\ndomain alignment without involving extra network structures. Furthermore, ARN\ndemonstrates strong robustness to a wide range of hyper-parameters settings,\ngreatly alleviating the task of model selection. Extensive empirical results\nvalidate that our approach outperforms other state-of-the-art domain alignment\nmethods.

Meanwhile, biometric\nauthentication has been corroborated to be an effective method for establishing\na person's identity with high confidence. Hence, recently, biometric\ntechnologies for smartphones have also become increasingly sophisticated and\npopular. But it is noteworthy that the application potential of palmprints for\nsmartphones is seriously underestimated. Studies in the past two decades have\nshown that palmprints have outstanding merits in uniqueness and permanence, and\nhave high user acceptance. However, currently, studies specializing in\npalmprint verification for smartphones are still quite sporadic, especially\nwhen compared to face- or fingerprint-oriented ones. In this paper, aiming to\nfill the aforementioned research gap, we conducted a thorough study of\npalmprint verification on smartphones and our contributions are twofold. First,\nto facilitate the study of palmprint verification on smartphones, we\nestablished an annotated palmprint dataset named MPD, which was collected by\nmulti-brand smartphones in two separate sessions with various backgrounds and\nillumination conditions. As the largest dataset in this field, MPD contains\n16,000 palm images collected from 200 subjects. Second, we built a DCNN-based\npalmprint verification system named DeepMPV+ for smartphones.

Existing studies typically involve linking semantic concepts to\nunits or layers of DNNs, but fail to explain the inference process. In this\npaper, we introduce neural architecture disentanglement (NAD) to fill the gap.\nSpecifically, NAD learns to disentangle a pre-trained DNN into\nsub-architectures according to independent tasks, forming information flows\nthat describe the inference processes. We investigate whether, where, and how\nthe disentanglement occurs through experiments conducted with handcrafted and\nautomatically-searched network architectures, on both object-based and\nscene-based datasets. Based on the experimental results, we present three new\nfindings that provide fresh insights into the inner logic of DNNs. First, DNNs\ncan be divided into sub-architectures for independent tasks. Second, deeper\nlayers do not always correspond to higher semantics. Third, the connection type\nin a DNN affects how the information flows across layers, leading to different\ndisentanglement behaviors. With NAD, we further explain why DNNs sometimes give\nwrong predictions.

Recent methods have shown that the matrix power normalization can\nstabilize the second-order information in bilinear features, but some problems,\ne.g., redundant information and over-fitting, remain to be resolved. In this\npaper, we propose an efficient Multi-Objective Matrix Normalization (MOMN)\nmethod that can simultaneously normalize a bilinear representation in terms of\nsquare-root, low-rank, and sparsity. These three regularizers can not only\nstabilize the second-order information, but also compact the bilinear features\nand promote model generalization. In MOMN, a core challenge is how to jointly\noptimize three non-smooth regularizers of different convex properties. To this\nend, MOMN first formulates them into an augmented Lagrange formula with\napproximated regularizer constraints. Then, auxiliary variables are introduced\nto relax different constraints, which allow each regularizer to be solved\nalternately. Finally, several updating strategies based on gradient descent are\ndesigned to obtain consistent convergence and efficient implementation.\nConsequently, MOMN is implemented with only matrix multiplication, which is\nwell-compatible with GPU acceleration, and the normalized bilinear features are\nstabilized and discriminative. Experiments on five public benchmarks for FGVC\ndemonstrate that the proposed MOMN is superior to existing normalization-based\nmethods in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.

This framework flexibly disentangles user-adaptation into\nmodel personalization on the server and local data regularization on the user\ndevice, with desirable properties regarding scalability and privacy\nconstraints. First, on the server, we introduce incremental learning of\ntask-specific expert models, subsequently aggregated using a concealed\nunsupervised user prior.

In this paper, we establish a systematic framework to\nanalyze the error performance of polar codes in the case of block mapping and\nrandom mapping. For both the mappings, by introducing the new concept, named\nsplit polar spectrum, we derive the upper bound on the error probability of\npolarized channel which explicitly reveals the relationship between the\ndiversity order L and the block-wise weight distribution of the codeword. For\nthe special case L=2 in the block mapping, we design the enumeration algorithm\nto calculate the exact split polar spectrum based on the general MacWilliams\nidentities. For arbitrary diversity order in the random mapping, with the help\nof uniform interleaving, we derive the approximate split polar spectrum by\ncombining the polar spectrum and the probability of fading pattern for a\nspecific weight. Furthermore, we propose the design criteria to construct polar\ncodes over the block fading channel. The full diversity criterion is the\nprimary target so as to achieve the diversity gain and the product distance\ncriterion requires to maximize the product of the block-wise Hamming distance\nwhereby obtain the coding gain.

This process is often simulated by the use of\nthe Monte Carlo method, which involves the probabilistic determination and\ntracking of simulated photon packages. In the regime of high optical depths,\nthis approach encounters difficulties since a proper representation of the\nvarious physical processes can only be achieved by considering high numbers of\nsimulated photon packages. As a consequence, the demand for computation time\nrises accordingly and thus practically puts a limit on the optical depth of\nmodels that can be simulated. Here we present a method that aims to solve the\nproblem of high optical depths in dusty media, which relies solely on the use\nof unbiased Monte Carlo radiative transfer. For that end, we identified and\nprecalculated repeatedly occuring and simulated processes, stored their outcome\nin a multidimensional cumulative distribution function, and immediately\nreplaced the basic Monte Carlo transfer during a simulation by that outcome.\nDuring the precalculation, we generated emission spectra as well as deposited\nenergy distributions of photon packages traveling from the center of a sphere\nto its rim.

In this work we take into account how departures from\nLTE in one element can affect others through changes in the opacities due to\nNLTE.

In this study we consider learning coding with the\nbandwidth-limited channel (BWLC). Recently, neural communication models such as\nvariational autoencoders have been studied for the task of source compression.\nWe build upon this work by studying neural communication systems with the BWLC.\nSpecifically,we find three modelling choices that are relevant under expected\ninformation loss. First, instead of separating the sub-tasks of compression\n(source coding) and error correction (channel coding), we propose to model both\njointly. Framing the problem as a variational learning problem, we conclude\nthat joint systems outperform their separate counterparts when coding is\nperformed by flexible learnable function approximators such as neural networks.\nTo facilitate learning, we introduce a differentiable and computationally\nefficient version of the bandwidth-limited channel. Second, we propose a design\nto model missing information with a prior, and incorporate this into the\nchannel model.

In addition, our data provide\nevidence of emission of gas excited by an active galactic nucleus located at\nthe position of the radio and X-ray sources, as revealed by the analysis of the\nemission-line ratios. The emission lines from the ionized gas in the field\npresent two kinematic components: one narrow with a velocity field suggesting a\ndisk rotation and a broad component due to winds from the star forming regions.\nThe molecular gas shows only the narrow component. The stellar velocity\ndispersion map presents an enhancement of about 7 km s$^{-1}$ at the position\nof the black hole, consistent with a mass of $1.5^{+1.3}_{-1.3}\\times10^6$\nM$_\\odot$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Mar 2020 12:09:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Aug 2022 18:11:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-19"}

How the physical properties of such CPDs are\naffected by the planetary mass and the overall opacity is relatively poorly\nunderstood. In order to clarify this, we use the global radiation hydrodynamics\ncode FARGOCA, with a grid structure that allows resolving the planetary\ngravitational potential sufficiently well for a CPD to form. We then study the\ngas flows and density/temperature structures that emerge as a function of\nplanet mass, opacity and potential depth. Our results indicate interesting\nstructure formation for Jupiter-mass planets at low opacities, which we\nsubsequently analyse in detail. Using an opacity level that is 100 times lower\nthan that of ISM dust, our Jupiter-mass protoplanet features an envelope that\nis sufficiently cold for a CPD to form, and a free-fall region separating the\nCPD and the circumstellar disc emerges. Interestingly, this free-fall region\nappears to be a result of supersonic erosion of outer envelope material, as\nopposed to the static structure formation that one would expect at low\nopacities. Our analysis reveals that the planetary spiral arms seem to pose a\nsignificant pressure barrier that needs to be overcome through radiative\ncooling in order for gas to free-fall onto the CPD. The circulation inside the\nCPD is near-keplerian and modified by the presence of CPD spiral arms. For high\nopacities we recover results from the literature, finding an essentially\nfeatureless hot envelope.

Among other features, they predict an exponential\nenhancement of the spectrum of scalar perturbations which however is not\ninherited by non-Gaussianities. In this work, I complete the calculation of the\ntrispectrum in this EFT by considering the contributions from the contact\ninteraction and the exchange diagram. While for most shapes the trispectrum is\napproximately constant, I find that for certain configurations where all the\nmomenta collapse to a line the trispectrum is proportional to $(m_s/H)^5$ for\nthe contact interaction and to $(m_s/H)^6$ for the exchange diagram, as\nanticipated by previous work. I also discuss the UV sensitivity of the results\nand argue why the EFT provides a good order of magnitude estimate. In the end,\nI confront the different predictions for the scalar spectrum against\nobservations. In models where the entropic mass is proportional to a positive\npower of the slow-roll parameter $\\epsilon$, like in hyperinflation, the\nspectrum grows on small scales and becomes constrained by the overproduction of\nprimordial black holes. Imposing such constraint jointly with the correct\namplitude and spectral tilt at CMB scales excludes a large set of potentials.\nOnly those where the spectral tilt is controlled by $m_s \\delta/H \\sim {\\cal\nO}(-0.01)$, where $\\delta=\\dot{\\epsilon}/(\\epsilon H)$ is the second slow-roll\nparameter, are likely observationally viable.

A number of previous works have shown that it performs well in\nmeasuring the similarities of individuals given a set of correctly labeled\npairwise data by domain experts. These important and precisely-labeled pairwise\ndata are often highly sensitive in real world (e.g., patients similarity). This\npaper studies, for the first time, how pairwise information can be leaked to\nattackers during distance metric learning, and develops differential pairwise\nprivacy (DPP), generalizing the definition of standard differential privacy,\nfor secure metric learning. Unlike traditional differential privacy which only\napplies to independent samples, thus cannot be used for pairwise data, DPP\nsuccessfully deals with this problem by reformulating the worst case.\nSpecifically, given the pairwise data, we reveal all the involved correlations\namong pairs in the constructed undirected graph. DPP is then formalized that\ndefines what kind of DML algorithm is private to preserve pairwise data. After\nthat, a case study employing the contrastive loss is exhibited to clarify the\ndetails of implementing a DPP-DML algorithm. Particularly, the sensitivity\nreduction technique is proposed to enhance the utility of the output distance\nmetric. Experiments both on a toy dataset and benchmarks demonstrate that the\nproposed scheme achieves pairwise data privacy without compromising the output\nperformance much (Accuracy declines less than 0.01 throughout all benchmark\ndatasets when the privacy budget is set at 4).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Mar 2020 12:47:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-31"}

The aim of this paper is to provide a dense feature\nrepresentation that can be used to perform localization, sparse matching or\nimage retrieval, regardless of the current seasonal or temporal appearance.\n  Recently, there have been several proposed methodologies for deep learning\ndense feature representations. These methods make use of ground truth\npixel-wise correspondences between pairs of images and focus on the spatial\nproperties of the features. As such, they don't address temporal or seasonal\nvariation. Furthermore, obtaining the required pixel-wise correspondence data\nto train in cross-seasonal environments is highly complex in most scenarios.\n  We propose Deja-Vu, a weakly supervised approach to learning season invariant\nfeatures that does not require pixel-wise ground truth data.

In this work we report the first detection of\ndeuterated molecules and a search for lithium hydride, 7LiH, at redshift z=0.89\nin the spiral galaxy intercepting the line of sight to the quasar PKS1830-211.\nWe used ALMA to observe several submillimeter lines of ND, NH2D, and HDO, and\ntheir related isotopomers NH2, NH3, and H2^18O, in absorption against the\nsouthwest image of the quasar, allowing us to derive XD/XH abundance ratios.\nThe absorption spectra mainly consist of two distinct narrow velocity\ncomponents for which we find remarkable differences. One velocity component\nshows XD/XH abundances that is about 10 times larger than the primordial\nelemental D/H ratio, and no variability of the absorption profile during the\ntime span of our observations. [...] The second component has XD/XH abundances\nthat are 100 times larger than the primordial D/H ratio, a deepening of the\nabsorption by a factor of two within a few months, and a rich chemical\ncomposition, with relative enhancements of N2H+, CH3OH, SO2, and complex\norganic molecules. We therefore speculate that this component is associated\nwith the analog of a Galactic dark cloud, while the first component is likely\nmore diffuse.

In this work we have performed, for the first time,\na spatially resolved study of the radio spectrum of this source down to\nMHz-frequencies, aimed at investigating its radiative age and duty cycle. We\nhave used new low frequency observations at 144 MHz performed with LOFAR and at\n350 MHz performed with the VLA combined with archival data at higher\nfrequencies. We find that the spectral indices in the lower frequency range\n144-614 MHz have flatter values ($\\sim$0.55-1.14) than those observed in the\nhigher frequency range 1400-4850 MHz ($\\sim$0.75-1.57) but follow the same\ndistribution across the lobes, with a systematic steepening towards the edges.\nHowever, the spectral shape throughout the source is not uniform and often\ndeviates from standard models. This suggests that mixing of different particle\npopulations is occurring, although it remains difficult to understand whether\nthis is caused by observational limitations (insufficient spatial resolution\nand/or projection effects) or by the intrinsic presence of multiple particle\npopulations, possibly related to the two different outbursts.

A template-based method begins with a template that\ncontains unknown quantities, and finds invariants that match the template by\nextracting and solving constraints on the unknowns. A disadvantage of\ntemplate-based methods is that they require fixing the set of terms that may\nappear in an invariant in advance. This disadvantage is particularly prominent\nfor non-linear invariant generation, because the user must supply maximum\ndegrees on polynomials, bases for exponents, etc. On the other hand,\nrecurrence-based methods are able to find sophisticated non-linear mathematical\nrelations, including polynomials, exponentials, and logarithms, because such\nrelations arise as the solutions to recurrences. However, a disadvantage of\npast recurrence-based invariant-generation methods is that they are primarily\nloop-based analyses: they use recurrences to relate the pre-state and\npost-state of a loop, so it is not obvious how to apply them to a recursive\nprocedure, especially if the procedure is non-linearly recursive (e.g., a\ntree-traversal algorithm). In this paper, we combine these two approaches and\nobtain a technique that uses templates in which the unknowns are functions\nrather than numbers, and the constraints on the unknowns are recurrences. The\ntechnique synthesizes invariants involving polynomials, exponentials, and\nlogarithms, even in the presence of arbitrary control-flow, including any\ncombination of loops, branches, and (possibly non-linear) recursion. For\ninstance, it is able to show that (i) the time taken by merge-sort is $O(n\n\\log(n))$, and (ii) the time taken by Strassen's algorithm is\n$O(n^{\\log_2(7)})$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Mar 2020 14:39:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-31"}

Methods: We performed a\nsystematic review to collate data from observational studies examining\nassociations of sex differences with clinical outcomes of COVID-19. PubMed, Web\nof Science and four preprint servers were searched for relevant studies. Data\nwere extracted and analyzed using meta-analysis where possible, with summary\ndata presented otherwise. Publicly available bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq),\nsingle-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), and chromatin immunoprecipitation\nsequencing (ChIP-seq) data were analyzed to explore the potential mechanisms\nunderlying the observed association. Results: 39 studies met inclusion\ncriteria, representing 77932 patients, of which 41510 (53.3%) were males. Men\nwere at a markedly increased risk of developing severe cases compared with\nwomen. Furthermore, the pooled odds ratio (OR) of mortality for male group\ncompared with the female group indicated significant higher mortality rate for\nmale.

First, a boundary condition is derived, which\nstates that the fluid near a solid wall must have a certain density $\\rho_{0}$\ndepending on the solid's properties. Unlike previous derivations, the one\npresented here is based on the same physics as the DIM itself and does not\nrequire additional assumptions. Second, asymptotic estimates are used to check\na conjecture lying at the foundation of the DIM, as well as all other models of\ncontact lines: that liquid-vapor interfaces are nearly isothermal. It turns out\nthat, for water, they are not -- although, for a more viscous fluid, they can\nbe. The non-isothermaility occurs locally, near the interface, but can still\naffect the contact-line dynamics. Third, the DIM coupled with a realistic\nequation of state for water is used to compute the dependence of the surface\ntension $\\sigma$ on the temperature $T$, which agrees well with the empiric\n$\\sigma(T)$. Fourth, the same framework is used to compute the static contact\nangle of a water-vapor interface. It is shown that, with increasing\ntemperature, the contact angle becomes either $180^{\\circ}$ (perfect\nhydrophobicity) or $0^{\\circ}$ (perfect hydrophilicity), depending on whether\n$\\rho_{0}$ matches the density of saturated vapor or liquid, respectively.

A bistellar flip on a partial triangulation flips an edge\n(an edge flip), removes a non-extreme point of degree 3, or adds a point in P \\\nP' as vertex of degree 3. The bistellar flip graph has all partial\ntriangulations as vertices, and a pair of partial triangulations is adjacent if\nthey can be obtained from one another by a bistellar flip. The edge flip graph\nis defined with full triangulations as vertices, and edge flips determining the\nadjacencies. Lawson showed in the early 70s that these graphs are connected.\nOur goal is to investigate these graphs, with emphasis on vertex connectivity.\n  For sets of n points in the plane in general position, we show that the edge\nflip graph is (n/2-2)-connected, and the bistellar flip graph is\n(n-3)-connected; both results are tight.

Yet, a\nmajor challenge has been to find a way to generate isolated attosecond pulses,\nbetter suited to timed-resolved experiments, rather than trains of pulses. A\npromising technique is the attosecond lighthouse effect, which consists in\nimprinting different propagation directions to successive attosecond pulses of\nthe train, and then spatially filtering one pulse in the far field. However, in\nthe relativistic regime, plasma mirrors get curved by the radiation pressure of\nthe incident laser and thus focus the generated harmonic beams. This increases\nthe harmonic beam divergence and makes it difficult to separate the attosecond\npulses angularly. In this article, we propose two novel techniques readily\napplicable in experiments to significantly reduce the divergence of Doppler\nharmonics, and achieve the generation of isolated attosecond pulses from the\nlighthouse effect without requiring few-cycle laser pulses. Their validity is\ndemonstrated using state-of-the-art simulations, which show that isolated\nattosecond pulses with $10$TW peak power in the X-UV range can be generated\nwith PW-class lasers.

At x-ray wavelengths, FELs typically rely on\nself-amplified spontaneous emission (SASE). Typical SASE emission contains\nmultiple temporal \"spikes\" which limit the longitudinal coherence of the\noptical output; hence, alternate schemes that improve on the longitudinal\ncoherence of the SASE emission are of interest. In this paper, we consnider\nelectron bunches that are shorter than the SASE spike separation. In such\ncases, the spontaneously generated radiation consists of a single optical pulse\nwith better longitudinal coherence than is found in typical SASE FELs. To\ninvestigate this regime, we use two FEL simulation codes. One (MINERVA) uses\nthe slowly-varying envelope approximation(SVEA) which breaks down for extremely\nshort pulses.

We then compare the two codes\nfor simulations using electron bunch lengths that are shorter than the SASE\nslice separation.

This paper examines feasibility of\nthese scenarios by analyzing the historical evolution of both weighted\ninternational inequality in CO2 emissions attributed territorially and global\ninequality in carbon footprints attributed to end consumers. For the latter, a\nnew dataset is constructed that is more comprehensive than existing ones. In\nboth cases, we find a decreasing trend in global inequality, partially\nattributed to the move of China from the lower to the middle part of the\ndistribution, with footprints more unequal than territorial emissions. These\nresults show that realization of the redistributive scenarios would require an\nunprecedented reduction in global inequality far below historical levels.\nMoreover, the territorial emissions data, available for more recent years up to\n2017, show a saturation of the decreasing Gini coefficient at a level of 0.5.\nThis observation confirms an earlier prediction based on maximal entropy\nreasoning that the Lorenz curve converges to the exponential distribution. This\nsaturation further undermines feasibility of the redistributive scenarios,\nwhich are also hindered by structural tendencies that reinforce carbon\nfootprint inequality under global capitalism. One way out of this conundrum is\na fast decarbonization of the global energy supply in order to decrease global\ncarbon emissions without relying crucially on carbon inequality reduction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Mar 2020 00:51:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-24"}

However, battery\nlife, device cost and sensor performance in the face of movement-related\nartefact present challenges which must be further addressed to see effective\napplications and wider adoption through commoditisation of the technology. We\naddress these challenges by demonstrating, through using a simple optical\nmeasurement, photoplethysmography (PPG) used conventionally for heart rate\ndetection in wrist-worn sensors, that we can provide improved heart rate and\nhuman activity recognition (HAR) simultaneously at low sample rates, without an\ninertial measurement unit. This simplifies hardware design and reduces costs\nand power budgets. We apply two deep learning pipelines, one for human activity\nrecognition and one for heart rate estimation. HAR is achieved through the\napplication of a visual classification approach, capable of robust performance\nat low sample rates. Here, transfer learning is leveraged to retrain a\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) to distinguish characteristics of the PPG\nduring different human activities. For heart rate estimation we use a CNN\nadopted for regression which maps noisy optical signals to heart rate\nestimates. In both cases, comparisons are made with leading conventional\napproaches.

On the boundary between ESI 2 and ESI 3 acuity assignments,\nwhich relates to the risk of decompensation, KATE was 93.2% higher with 80%\naccuracy, compared to triage nurses with 41.4% accuracy (p-value < 0.0001).\nKATE provides a triage acuity assignment substantially more accurate than the\ntriage nurses in this study sample. KATE operates independently of contextual\nfactors, unaffected by the external pressures that can cause under triage and\nmay mitigate the racial and social biases that can negatively affect the\naccuracy of triage assignment. Future research should focus on the impact of\nKATE providing feedback to triage nurses in real time, KATEs impact on\nmortality and morbidity, ED throughput, resource optimization, and nursing\noutcomes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Mar 2020 20:18:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Sep 2020 15:38:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-20"}

Here we present a\ntwo-step analysis utilising current machine learning techniques for imputing\nprecipitation data sampled at 30-minute intervals by devolving the task into\n(a) the classification of rain or non-rain samples, and (b) regressing the\nabsolute values of predicted rain samples. Investigating 37 weather stations in\nthe UK, this machine learning process produces more accurate predictions for\nrecovering precipitation data than an established surface fitting technique\nutilising neighbouring rain gauges. Increasing available features for the\ntraining of machine learning algorithms increases performance with the\nintegration of weather data at the target site with externally sourced rain\ngauges providing the highest performance. This method informs machine learning\nmodels by utilising information in concurrently collected environmental data to\nmake accurate predictions of missing rain data. Capturing complex non-linear\nrelationships from weakly correlated variables is critical for data recovery at\nsub-hourly resolutions. Such pipelines for data recovery can be developed and\ndeployed for highly automated and near instantaneous imputation of missing\nvalues in ongoing datasets at high temporal resolutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Mar 2020 10:47:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 2 May 2020 09:11:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-21"}

The main reason is that the existing techniques\nrequired a lot of annotated data to reach good performance. Recently, a new\ndistributional representation of words has been proposed to project named\nentities from a rich language to a low-resource one. This representation has\nbeen coupled to a neural network in order to project named entities from\nEnglish to Ewondo, a Bantu language spoken in Cameroon. Although the proposed\nmethod reached appreciable results, the size of the used neural network was too\nlarge compared to the size of the dataset. Furthermore the impact of the model\nparameters has not been studied. In this paper, we show experimentally that the\nsame results can be obtained using a smaller neural network. We also emphasize\nthe parameters that are highly correlated to the network performance.
