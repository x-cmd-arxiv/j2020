This\nallows for a linear inference of the parameters that characterize external\nsignals. In practice, however, quantum sensors are able to detect fields only\nin a narrow range of amplitudes and frequencies. A departure from this range,\nas well as the presence of significant noise sources and short detection times,\nlead to a loss of the linear relationship between the response of the sensor\nand the target field, thus limiting the working regime of the sensor. Here we\naddress these challenges by means of a Bayesian inference approach that is\ntolerant to strong deviations from desired periodic responses of the sensor and\nis able to provide reliable estimates even with a very limited number of\nmeasurements.

Using this result and the basic properties of entanglement under\nnoise, we present a set of hierarchies that localizable entanglement over a\nspecific subsystem in a multiqubit state can obey when local noise acts on the\nsubparts or on all the qubits of the whole system. In particular, we propose\ntwo types of hierarchies -- one tailored according to the number of noisy\nunmeasured qubits, and the other one that depends additionally on the\ncardinality of the set of noisy measured qubits, leading to the classification\nof quantum states. We report the percentage of states satisfying the proposed\nhierarchies in the case of random three- and four-qubit systems and show, using\nboth analytical methods and numerical simulations, that in almost all the\ncases, anticipated hierarchies tend to hold with the variation of the strength\nof noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Mar 2020 16:39:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-05"}

A common approach in\npractical algorithm design is to reduce the size of a given instance by a fast\npreprocessing step while being able to recover key information even after this\nreduction. This notion is formally studied as kernelization (or simply, kernel)\n-- a polynomial time procedure which yields an equivalent instance whose size\nis bounded in terms of some given parameter. It follows from known results that\nmakespan minimization parameterized by the longest job processing time\n$p_{\\max}$ has a kernelization yielding a reduced instance whose size is\nexponential in $p_{\\max}$. Can this be reduced to polynomial in $p_{\\max}$?\n  We answer this affirmatively not only for makespan minimization, but also for\nthe (more complicated) objective of minimizing the weighted sum of completion\ntimes, also in the setting of unrelated machines when the number of machine\nkinds is a parameter. Our algorithm first solves the Configuration LP and based\non its solution constructs a solution of an intermediate problem, called huge\n$N$-fold integer programming. This solution is further reduced in size by a\nseries of steps, until its encoding length is polynomial in the parameters.\nThen, we show that huge $N$-fold IP is in NP, which implies that there is a\npolynomial reduction back to our scheduling problem, yielding a kernel.\n  Our technique is highly novel in the context of kernelization, and our\nstructural theorem about the Configuration LP is of independent interest.\nMoreover, we show a polynomial kernel for huge $N$-fold IP conditional on\nwhether the so-called separation subproblem can be solved in polynomial time.\nConsidering that integer programming does not admit polynomial kernels except\nfor quite restricted cases, our \"conditional kernel\" provides new insight.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Mar 2020 17:01:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-05"}

The\nmeasurements are performed in six pseudorapidity regions: three of them ($\\eta\n> 10.75$, $8.99 < \\eta < 9.21$ and $8.80 < \\eta < 8.99$), albeit with smaller\nacceptance and larger uncertainties, were already published in a previous work,\nwhereas the remaining three ($10.06 < \\eta < 10.75$, $9.65 < \\eta < 10.06$ and\n$8.65 < \\eta < 8.80$) are presented here for the first time. The analysis was\ncarried out using a data set acquired in June 2015 with a corresponding\nintegrated luminosity of $\\mathrm{0.194~nb^{-1}}$. Comparing the experimental\nmeasurements with the expectations of several hadronic interaction models used\nto simulate cosmic ray air showers, none of these generators resulted to have a\nsatisfactory agreement in all the phase space selected for the analysis. The\ninclusive differential production cross section for $\\eta > 10.75$ is not\nreproduced by any model, whereas the results still indicate a significant but\nless serious deviation at lower pseudorapidities. Depending on the\npseudorapidity region, the generators showing the best overall agreement with\ndata are either SIBYLL 2.3 or EPOS-LHC. Furthermore, apart from the most\nforward region, the derived energy flow and cross section distributions are\nbest reproduced by EPOS-LHC. Finally, even if none of the models describe the\nelasticity distribution in a satisfactory way, the extracted average\ninelasticity is consistent with the QGSJET II-04 value, while most of the other\ngenerators give values that lie just outside the experimental uncertainties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Mar 2020 17:06:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 4 Apr 2020 09:19:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 10 Jul 2020 13:47:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-10"}

We develop a causal model that summarizes the economic process of\ninflation. Based on this causal model and recent data, we discuss and identify\nthe assumptions under which the effect of central bank independence on\ninflation can be identified and estimated. Given these and alternative\nassumptions, we estimate this effect using modern doubly robust effect\nestimators, i.e., longitudinal targeted maximum likelihood estimators. The\nestimation procedure incorporates machine learning algorithms and is tailored\nto address the challenges associated with complex longitudinal macroeconomic\ndata. We do not find strong support for the hypothesis that having an\nindependent central bank for a long period of time necessarily lowers\ninflation. Simulation studies evaluate the sensitivity of the proposed methods\nin complex settings when certain assumptions are violated and highlight the\nimportance of working with appropriate learning algorithms for estimation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Mar 2020 17:26:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 May 2020 14:32:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 18 May 2020 07:58:08 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 24 Jul 2020 10:24:19 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2020 07:20:39 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Mon, 15 Mar 2021 07:48:55 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Fri, 14 May 2021 09:26:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-17"}

We introduce a general\ndescription of second-order 2-to-2 scattering processes in a plane-wave\nbackground field, indicating the necessity of considering the localization of\nthe colliding particles and achieving that by means of wave packets. We define\na local cross section in the background field, which generalizes the vacuum\ncross section and which, though not being directly an observable, allows for a\ncomparison between the results in the plane wave and in vacuum without relying\non the shape of the incoming wave packets. Two possible cascade or two-step\nchannels have been identified in the annihilation process and an alternative\nway of representing the two-step and one-step contributions via a \"virtuality\"\nintegral has been found.

As antenna elements are becoming smaller and\ncheaper in the mmW range compared to radio frequency (RF) chains, it is crucial\nto perform antenna selection at the transmitter, such that the available RF\nchains are switched to an appropriate subset of antennas. This paper considers\nthe joint problem of multicast beamforming and antenna selection for a single\nmulticast group in massive MIMO systems. The prior state-of-art for this\nproblem relies on semi-definite relaxation (SDR), which cannot scale up to the\nmassive MIMO regime. A successive convex approximation (SCA) based approach is\nproposed to tackle max-min fair joint multicast beamforming and antenna\nselection. The key idea of SCA is to successively approximate the non-convex\nproblem by a class of non-smooth, convex optimization problems. Two fast and\nmemory efficient first-order methods are proposed to solve each SCA subproblem.\nSimulations demonstrate that the proposed algorithms outperform the existing\nstate-of-art approach in terms of solution quality and run time, in both\ntraditional and especially in massive MIMO settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Mar 2020 18:26:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-05"}

Even joint detection using base station (BS)\ncooperation often fails to reliably detect such users, due to near-far power\nimbalance, and channel estimation errors. Is it possible to bypass the channel\nestimation stage and design a detector that can reliably detect cell-edge user\nsignals under significant near-far imbalance? This paper shows, perhaps\nsurprisingly, that the answer is affirmative -- albeit not via traditional\nmultiuser detection. Exploiting that cell-edge user signals are weak but {\\em\ncommon} to different base stations, while cell-center users are unique to their\nserving BS, this paper establishes an elegant connection between cell-edge user\ndetection and canonical correlation analysis (CCA) of the associated space-time\nbaseband-equivalent matrices. It proves that CCA identifies the common subspace\nof these matrices, even under significant intra- and inter-cell interference.\nThe resulting mixture of cell-edge user signals can subsequently be unraveled\nusing a well-known algebraic signal processing technique. Interestingly, the\nproposed approach does not even require that the signals from the different\nbase stations are synchronized -- the right synchronization can be\nautomatically determined as well. Experimental results demonstrate that the\nproposed approach achieves order of magnitude BER improvements compared to\n`oracle' multiuser detection that assumes perfect knowledge of the cell-center\nuser channels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Mar 2020 18:53:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-05"}

This results in a topologically trivial\nAnderson insulator. Here, we introduce the anomalous levitation and pair\nannihilation, a process unique to periodically-driven, or Floquet systems. Due\nto the periodicity of the quasienergy spectrum, we find it is possible for the\ntopological gap to increase as a function of disorder strength. Thus, after all\nbulk states have localized, the system remains topologically nontrivial,\nforming an anomalous Floquet Anderson insulator (AFAI) phase.

Because of their ultraweak interactions\nthe hidden sector neutralinos are not thermally produced and we assume their\ninitial relic density to be negligible.

In an attempt to produce the rings and gaps in some of\nthese systems, they have been modeled numerically with a single embedded planet\nassuming a locally isothermal equation of state. This is often justified by\nobservations targeting the irradiation-dominated outer regions of disks\n(approximately 100 au). We test this assumption by conducting hydrodynamics\nsimulations of embedded planets in thin locally isothermal and radiative disks\nthat mimic the systems HD 163296 and AS 209 in order to examine the effect of\nincluding the energy equation in a seemingly locally isothermal environment as\nfar as planet-disk interaction is concerned. We find that modeling such disks\nwith an ideal equation of state makes a difference in terms of the number of\nproduced rings and the spiral arm contrast in the disk. Locally isothermal\ndisks produce sharper annular or azimuthal features and overestimate a single\nplanet's gap-opening capabilities by producing multiple gaps. In contrast,\nplanets in radiative disks carve a single gap for typical disk parameters.\nConsequently, for accurate modeling of planets with semimajor axes up to about\n100 au, radiative effects should be taken into account even in seemingly\nlocally isothermal disks. In addition, for the case of AS 209, we find that the\nprimary gap is significantly different between locally isothermal and radiative\nmodels.

The dilation-erosion perceptron (DEP) is a\nmorphological neural network obtained by a convex combination of a dilation and\nan erosion followed by the application of a hard-limiter function for binary\nclassification tasks. A DEP classifier can be trained using a convex-concave\nprocedure along with the minimization of the hinge loss function. As a lattice\ncomputing model, the DEP classifier assumes the feature and class spaces are\npartially ordered sets.

An r-DEP classifier is obtained by endowing the feature\nspace with an appropriate reduced ordering.

When training data exhibit class imbalances, the class-wise\nreweighted version of logistic and softmax losses are often used to boost\nperformance of the unweighted version. In this paper, motivated to explain the\nreweighting mechanism, we explicate the learning property of those two loss\nfunctions by analyzing the necessary condition (e.g., gradient equals to zero)\nafter training CNNs to converge to a local minimum. The analysis immediately\nprovides us explanations for understanding (1) quantitative effects of the\nclass-wise reweighting mechanism: deterministic effectiveness for binary\nclassification using logistic loss yet indeterministic for multi-class\nclassification using softmax loss; (2) disadvantage of logistic loss for\nsingle-label multi-class classification via one-vs.-all approach, which is due\nto the averaging effect on predicted probabilities for the negative class\n(e.g., non-target classes) in the learning process. With the disadvantage and\nadvantage of logistic loss disentangled, we thereafter propose a novel\nreweighted logistic loss for multi-class classification. Our simple yet\neffective formulation improves ordinary logistic loss by focusing on learning\nhard non-target classes (target vs. non-target class in one-vs.-all) and turned\nout to be competitive with softmax loss.

A new approach to address this\nlimitation is to make use of data compression in the form of a compressed data\narray. Storing data in a compressed data array and converting to standard\nIEEE-754 types as needed during a computation can reduce the pressure on\nbandwidth and storage. However, repeated conversions (lossy compression and\ndecompression) introduce additional approximation errors, which need to be\nshown to not significantly affect the simulation results. We extend recent work\n[J. Diffenderfer, et al., Error Analysis of ZFP Compression for Floating-Point\nData, SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing, 2019] that analyzed the error of a\nsingle use of compression and decompression of the ZFP compressed data array\nrepresentation [P.

An upper bound is established on the\nnumber of additional iterations required for the convergence of stationary\nfixed-point iterations. An additional analysis of traditional forward and\nbackward error of stationary iterative methods using ZFP compressed arrays is\nalso presented.

To allow fault recovery\nfrom randomly injected faults to different robots in a swarm, a model-free\napproach may be preferable due to the accumulation of faults in models and the\ndifficulty to predict the behaviour of neighbouring robots. One model-free\napproach to fault recovery involves two phases: during simulation, a\nquality-diversity algorithm evolves a behaviourally diverse archive of\ncontrollers; during the target application, a search for the best controller is\ninitiated after fault injection. In quality-diversity algorithms, the choice of\nthe behavioural descriptor is a key design choice that determines the quality\nof the evolved archives, and therefore the fault recovery performance. Although\nthe environment is an important determinant of behaviour, the impact of\nenvironmental diversity is often ignored in the choice of a suitable\nbehavioural descriptor. This study compares different behavioural descriptors,\nincluding two generic descriptors that work on a wide range of tasks, one\nhand-coded descriptor which fits the domain of interest, and one novel type of\ndescriptor based on environmental diversity, which we call\nQuality-Environment-Diversity (QED). Results demonstrate that the\nabove-mentioned model-free approach to fault recovery is feasible in the\ncontext of swarm robotics, reducing the fault impact by a factor 2-3. Further,\nthe environmental diversity obtained with QED yields a unique behavioural\ndiversity profile that allows it to recover from high-impact faults.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Mar 2020 21:36:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-06"}

We aim at studying the\nevolution of galaxies that, at a given redshift, lie simultaneously on the\nmass-metallicity and main sequence relations (MZR, MSR). To this aim, we use\nthe analytical, 'leaky-box' chemical evolution model of Spitoni et al. (2017),\nin which galaxy evolution is described by an infall timescale $\\tau$ and a wind\nefficiency $\\lambda$. We provide a detailed analysis of the temporal evolution\nof galactic metallicity, stellar mass, mass-weighted age and gas fraction. The\nevolution of the galaxies lying on the MZR and MSR at $z\\sim0.1$ suggests that\nthe average infall time-scale in two different bins of stellar masses\n($M_{\\star}<10^{10} M_{\\odot}$ and $M_{\\star}>10^{10} M_{\\odot}$) decreases\nwith decreasing redshift. This means that at each redshift, only the youngest\ngalaxies can be assembled on the shortest timescales and still belong to the\nstar-forming MSR. In the lowest mass bin, a decrease of the median $\\tau$ is\naccompanied by an increase of the median $\\lambda$ value. This implies that\nsystems which have formed at more recent times will need to eject a larger\namount of mass to keep their metallicity at low values. Another important\nresult is that galactic downsizing, as traced by the age-mass relation, is\nnaturally recovered by imposing that local galaxies lie on both the MZR and\nMSR.

Alternative low-communication policies, such as\nJSQ(d) and the recently proposed JIQ, are either unstable or provide poor\nperformance.\n  We introduce the Local Shortest Queue (LSQ) family of load balancing\nalgorithms. In these algorithms, each dispatcher maintains its own, local, and\npossibly outdated view of the server queue lengths, and keeps using JSQ on its\nlocal view. A small communication overhead is used infrequently to update this\nlocal view. We formally prove that as long as the error in these local\nestimates of the server queue lengths is bounded in expectation, the entire\nsystem is strongly stable. Finally, in simulations, we show how simple and\nstable LSQ policies exhibit appealing performance and significantly outperform\nexisting low-communication policies, while using an equivalent communication\nbudget.

We then select six\nrepresentative compression schemes using this model and implement them in HOPE.\nThese schemes make different trade-offs between compression rate and encoding\nspeed. We evaluate HOPE on five data structures used in databases: SuRF, ART,\nHOT, B+tree, and Prefix B+tree. Our experiments show that using HOPE allows the\nsearch trees to achieve lower query latency (up to 40\\% lower) and better\nmemory efficiency (up to 30\\% smaller) simultaneously for most string key\nworkloads.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Mar 2020 01:02:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-06"}

In the deeply degenerate regime, we show through precise\nmeasurements of density fluctuations and expansion dynamics that the large $N$\nof spin states under SU($N$) symmetry leads to pronounced interaction effects\nin a system with a nominally negligible interaction parameter. Accounting for\nthese effects we demonstrate thermometry accurate to one-hundredth of the Fermi\nenergy. We also demonstrate record speed for preparing degenerate Fermi seas,\nreaching $T/T_F = 0.12$ in under 3 s, enabled by the SU($N$) symmetric\ninteractions. This, along with the introduction of a new spin polarizing\nmethod, enables operation of a 3D optical lattice clock in the band\ninsulating-regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Mar 2020 03:00:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 7 Mar 2020 22:48:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-03"}

The low signal-to-noise ratio of exoplanet observations\nrequire a Bayesian approach to determine posterior probability distributions of\neach model parameter, given observed spectra. This inference is computationally\nexpensive, as it requires many executions of a costly radiative transfer (RT)\nsimulation for each set of sampled model parameters. Machine learning (ML) has\nrecently been shown to provide a significant reduction in runtime for\nretrievals, mainly by training inverse ML models that predict parameter\ndistributions, given observed spectra, albeit with reduced posterior accuracy.\nHere we present a novel approach to retrieval by training a forward ML\nsurrogate model that predicts spectra given model parameters, providing a fast\napproximate RT simulation that can be used in a conventional Bayesian retrieval\nframework without significant loss of accuracy. We demonstrate our method on\nthe emission spectrum of HD 189733 b and find good agreement with a traditional\nretrieval from the Bayesian Atmospheric Radiative Transfer (BART) code\n(Bhattacharyya coefficients of 0.9843--0.9972, with a mean of 0.9925, between\n1D marginalized posteriors).

It is\nknown that $k$-means clustering is highly sensitive to noise, and thus noise\nshould be removed to obtain a quality solution. A popular formulation of this\nproblem is called $k$-means clustering with outliers. The goal of $k$-means\nclustering with outliers is to discard up to a specified number $z$ of points\nas noise/outliers and then find a $k$-means solution on the remaining data. The\nproblem has received significant attention, yet current algorithms with\ntheoretical guarantees suffer from either high running time or inherent loss in\nthe solution quality. The main contribution of this paper is two-fold. Firstly,\nwe develop a simple greedy algorithm that has provably strong worst case\nguarantees. The greedy algorithm adds a simple preprocessing step to remove\nnoise, which can be combined with any $k$-means clustering algorithm. This\nalgorithm gives the first pseudo-approximation-preserving reduction from\n$k$-means with outliers to $k$-means without outliers. Secondly, we show how to\nconstruct a coreset of size $O(k \\log n)$. When combined with our greedy\nalgorithm, we obtain a scalable, near linear time algorithm. The theoretical\ncontributions are verified experimentally by demonstrating that the algorithm\nquickly removes noise and obtains a high-quality clustering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Mar 2020 05:04:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 13 Apr 2020 04:26:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-14"}

To tackle\nthis problem, we construct a large-scale drone-based RGB-Infrared vehicle\ndetection dataset, termed DroneVehicle. Our DroneVehicle collects 28, 439\nRGB-Infrared image pairs, covering urban roads, residential areas, parking\nlots, and other scenarios from day to night. Due to the great gap between RGB\nand infrared images, cross-modal images provide both effective information and\nredundant information.

To restore\nlow-light LFs we should harness the geometric cues present in different LF\nviews, which is not possible using single-frame low-light enhancement\ntechniques. We, therefore, propose a deep neural network for Low-Light Light\nField (L3F) restoration, which we refer to as L3Fnet. The proposed L3Fnet not\nonly performs the necessary visual enhancement of each LF view but also\npreserves the epipolar geometry across views. We achieve this by adopting a\ntwo-stage architecture for L3Fnet. Stage-I looks at all the LF views to encode\nthe LF geometry. This encoded information is then used in Stage-II to\nreconstruct each LF view. To facilitate learning-based techniques for low-light\nLF imaging, we collected a comprehensive LF dataset of various scenes. For each\nscene, we captured four LFs, one with near-optimal exposure and ISO settings\nand the others at different levels of low-light conditions varying from low to\nextreme low-light settings. The effectiveness of the proposed L3Fnet is\nsupported by both visual and numerical comparisons on this dataset. To further\nanalyze the performance of low-light reconstruction methods, we also propose an\nL3F-wild dataset that contains LF captured late at night with almost zero lux\nvalues. No ground truth is available in this dataset. To perform well on the\nL3F-wild dataset, any method must adapt to the light level of the captured\nscene. To do this we propose a novel pre-processing block that makes L3Fnet\nrobust to various degrees of low-light conditions. Lastly, we show that L3Fnet\ncan also be used for low-light enhancement of single-frame images, despite it\nbeing engineered for LF data. We do so by converting the single-frame DSLR\nimage into a form suitable to L3Fnet, which we call as pseudo-LF.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Mar 2020 05:32:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2020 11:16:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-29"}

On the basis of the non-LTE\nanalysis using the N2H+ 3-2 and 1-0 data, the density and temperature of the\nfilaments are estimated to be ~10^7 cm-3 and ~15-20 K, respectively. The core\nfragmentation is observed in three massive filaments, one of which shows the\noscillations in the velocity and intensity that could be the signature of\ncore-forming gas motions. The gas kinetic temperature is significantly enhanced\nin the eastern part of OMC1, likely due to the external heating from the high\nmass stars in M42 and M43. In addition, the filaments are colder than their\nsurrounding regions, suggesting the shielding from the external heating due to\nthe dense gas in the filaments. The OMC1 region consists of three sub-regions,\ni.e. north, west, and south of Orion KL, having different radial velocities\nwith sharp velocity transitions. There is a north-to-south velocity gradient\nfrom the western to the southern regions. The observed velocity pattern\nsuggests that dense gas in OMC1 is collapsing globally toward the high-mass\nstar-forming region, Orion Nebula Cluster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Mar 2020 07:07:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

High-dimensional recovery has been\none of the emerging topics in the last decade partly due to the celebrated work\nof Candes, Romberg and Tao (e.g. [CRT06, CRT04]). The original analysis there\n(and the works thereafter) necessitates a strong concentration argument\n(namely, the restricted isometry property), which only holds for a rather\nrestricted class of measurements with light-tailed distributions. It had long\nbeen conjectured that high-dimensional recovery is possible even if restricted\nisometry type conditions do not hold, but the general theory was beyond the\ngrasp until very recently, when the works [Men14a, KM15] propose a new\nsmall-ball method.

Particularly, sophisticated theoretical methods\nin time-reversal-invariant topological phases have been developed, leading to\nthe comprehensive search of crystal database and the prediction of thousands of\nnew topological materials. In contrast, the discovery of magnetic topological\nphases that break time reversal is still limited to several exemplary materials\nbecause the coexistence of magnetism and topological electronic band structure\nis rare in a single compound. To overcome this challenge, we propose an\nalternative approach to realize the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect, a\ntypical example of magnetic topological phase, via engineering two-dimensional\n(2D) magnetic van der Waals heterojunctions. Instead of a single magnetic\ntopological material, we search for the combinations of two 2D (typically\ntrivial) magnetic insulator compounds with specific band alignment so that they\ncan together form a type-III heterojunction with topologically non-trivial band\nstructure. By combining the data-driven materials search, first principles\ncalculations, and the symmetry-based analytical models, we identify 8 type-III\nheterojunctions consisting of 2D ferromagnetic insulator materials from a\nfamily of 2D monolayer MXY compounds (M = metal atoms, X = S, Se, Te, Y = F,\nCl, Br, I) as a set of candidates for the QAH effect.

Unfortunately, such polices are often not transferable to the\nreal world due to a mismatch between the simulation and reality, called\n'reality gap'. Domain randomization methods tackle this problem by randomizing\nthe physics simulator (source domain) during training according to a\ndistribution over domain parameters in order to obtain more robust policies\nthat are able to overcome the reality gap. Most domain randomization approaches\nsample the domain parameters from a fixed distribution.

Generation of\nmonodispersed bulk NBs with specified gas content remains a challenge. We\ndeveloped a simple method for generating bulk NBs, using porous alumina films\nwith ordered straight nano-scaled holes. Different techniques, such as\nnanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and\ninfrared absorption spectroscopy (IRAS), are used to confirm NB formation. The\nNTA data demonstrates that the minimum size of the NBs formed is less than 100\nnm, which is comparable to the diameter of nanoholes in the porous alumina\nfilm. By generating NBs with different gases, including CO2, O2, N2, Ar, and\nHe, we discovered that the minimum size of NBs negatively correlated with the\nsolubility of encapsulated gases in water. Due to the monodispersed size of NBs\ngenerated from the highly ordered porous alumina, we determined that NB size is\ndistributed discretely with a uniform increment factor of sqrt(2). To explain\nthe observed characteristic size distribution of NBs, we propose a simple model\nin which two NBs of the same size are assumed to preferentially coalesce. This\ncharacteristic bubble size distribution is useful for elucidating the basic\ncharacteristics of nanobubbles, such as the long-term stability of NBs. This\ndistribution can also be used to develop new applications of NBs, for example,\nnano-scaled reaction fields through bubble coalescence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Mar 2020 08:20:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-24"}

The network does not have a central\nprocessing unit or fusion center (FC).

For this reason,\nwe study the use of a simpler test (referred as L-MP) which uses the product of\nthe marginals of the measurements taken at each node, where the unknown\nparameters are easily estimated with only local measurements. Although this\nsimple proposal still requires network-wide cooperation between nodes, the\nnumber of communications is significantly reduced with respect to the GLR test,\nmaking it a suitable choice in severely resource-constrained sensor networks.\nThis simpler test does not exploit the full parametric model of data, so, it\nbecomes important to analyze its statistical properties and its potential\nperformance loss.

On\nthe contrary, no significant SFR enhancement is found for the paired galaxies\nwith low kinematic asymmetry even when their projected separation is small (dp\n< 30 kpc).

Embryonic development is of great importance\nbecause it determines congenital anomalies and influences their severity.\nWhereas there is detailed qualitative knowledge of the successive steps of\nembryonic development, little is known about their probabilities of success or\nfailure. Embryonic mortality as a function of post fertilization time provides\na simple (albeit crude) way to identify major defects. We find that, in line\nwith the few other species for which data are available, the embryonic\nmortality of zebrafish has a prominent peak shortly after fertilization. This\nis called the early embryonic mortality (EEM) effect. Although a number of\nimmediate causes of death (e.g. infection, excess of carbon dioxide or of\nlactic acid, chromosomal defects) can be cited, the common underlying factor\nremains unknown.\n  After reviewing embryonic mortality data available for chicken and a few\nother farm animals, we explain that zebrafish are particularly suited for such\na study because embryogenesis can be followed from its very beginning and can\nbe observed easily thanks to transparent egg shells.\n  We report the following findings. (i) The mortality peak occurs in the first\n15% of the 75-80 hours of embryogenesis and it is about 50 times higher than\nthe low plateau which follows. (ii) The shape of the age-specific death rate is\nlargely independent of the death level.\n  Presently, little is known about the nature of embryonic defects. However, by\nreviewing two special cases we show that even small initial defects, e.g.\nspatial cellular asymmetries or irregularities in the timing of development,\ncarry with them lethal effects in later stages of embryogenesis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Mar 2020 09:56:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-06"}

In this context, a reason\nfor the challenges modellers are facing may lie in the mismatch between the\nrelative scarcity of waves in ice data available for testing theories, and the\nwide diversity of phenomena happening at sea. This lack of experimental data\nmay be explained, at least in part, by the high cost of waves in ice\ninstruments.

In this paper, we build on domain adversarial learning\nand propose a novel domain adaptation method BA$^3$US with two new techniques\ntermed Balanced Adversarial Alignment (BAA) and Adaptive Uncertainty\nSuppression (AUS), respectively. On one hand, negative transfer results in\nmisclassification of target samples to the classes only present in the source\ndomain. To address this issue, BAA pursues the balance between label\ndistributions across domains in a fairly simple manner. Specifically, it\nrandomly leverages a few source samples to augment the smaller target domain\nduring domain alignment so that classes in different domains are symmetric. On\nthe other hand, a source sample would be denoted as uncertain if there is an\nincorrect class that has a relatively high prediction score, and such\nuncertainty easily propagates to unlabeled target data around it during\nalignment, which severely deteriorates adaptation performance. Thus we present\nAUS that emphasizes uncertain samples and exploits an adaptive weighted\ncomplement entropy objective to encourage incorrect classes to have uniform and\nlow prediction scores.

The models span the metallicity range\n-2.3<[M/H<+0.26 for a suite of IMF types with varying slopes. These predictions\ncan complement and aid fluctuation magnitudes studies, permitting a first order\napproximation by applying filter responses to the SBF spectra to obtain\nspectroscopic SBF magnitudes. We provide a recipe for obtaining the latter and\ndiscuss their uncertainties and limitations. We compare our spectroscopic SBF\nmagnitudes to photometric data of a sample of early-type galaxies. We also show\nthat the SBF spectra can be very useful for constraining relevant stellar\npopulation parameters. We find small (<5%) mass-fractions of extremely\nmetal-poor components ([M/H]<-1) on the top of the dominant, old and metal-rich\nstellar population. These results put stringent constraints on the early stages\nof galaxy formation in massive elliptical galaxies. This is remarkable given\nthe high degree of degeneracy of the standard spectral analysis to such\nmetal-poor stellar populations in the visible and in the near-IR.

As a remedy, we introduce an adaptive\ntraining technique by learning an efficient a posteriori error estimator over\nthe parameter domain. A fast learning process is created by interpolating the\nerror estimator using radial basis functions (RBF) over a fine parameter\ntraining set, representing the whole parameter domain. The error estimator is\nevaluated only on a coarse training set including a few parameter samples. The\nalgorithm is an extension of the work in Chellappa et al.

Our goal is\nto have an algorithm which is tractable in combined complexity, i.e., in the\nsizes of the input document and the VA; while ensuring the best possible data\ncomplexity bounds in the input document size, i.e., constant delay in the\ndocument size. Several recent works at PODS'18 proposed such algorithms but\nwith linear delay in the document size or with an exponential dependency in\nsize of the (generally nondeterministic) input VA. In particular, Florenzano et\nal. suggest that our desired runtime guarantees cannot be met for general\nsequential VAs. We refute this and show that, given a nondeterministic\nsequential VA and an input document, we can enumerate the mappings of the VA on\nthe document with the following bounds: the preprocessing is linear in the\ndocument size and polynomial in the size of the VA, and the delay is\nindependent of the document and polynomial in the size of the VA. The resulting\nalgorithm thus achieves tractability in combined complexity and the best\npossible data complexity bounds.

We also generalize the efficient polynomial-time\napproximation scheme (EPTAS) and subexponential algorithm for disks [Bonnet et\nal. '18, Bonamy et al.

It is not known whether this problem is NP-hard. We observe\nthat, so far, all the hardness proofs for Maximum Clique in intersection graph\nclasses $\\mathcal I$ follow the same road. They show that, for every graph $G$\nof a large-enough class $\\mathcal C$, the complement of an even subdivision of\n$G$ belongs to the intersection class $\\mathcal I$. Then they conclude invoking\nthe hardness of Maximum Independent Set on the class $\\mathcal C$, and the fact\nthat the even subdivision preserves that hardness.

Although this diagonal sweeping DDM is\nessentially multiplicative, it is highly suitable for parallel computing of the\nHelmholtz problem with multiple right-hand sides when combined with the\npipeline processing since the number of sequential steps in each sweep is much\nsmaller than the number of subdomains. In this paper, we propose and analyze a\ntrace transfer-based diagonal sweeping DDM. A major advantage of changing from\nsource transfer to trace transfer for information passing between neighbor\nsubdomains is that the resulting diagonal sweeps become easier to analyze and\nimplement and more efficient, since the transferred traces have only $2n$\ncardinal directions between neighbor subdomains while the transferred sources\ncome from a total of $3^n-1$ cardinal and corner directions.

After an order\nparameter, $r$, is defined, it can be derived how $r=0$ for $T>T_c$ and how $r\n\\propto (T_c - T)^\\gamma$ at lowest order for $T < T_c$. The value of $\\gamma$\nappears to not depend on physical details of the system, but very much on\ndimensionality. No phase transitions exist for one-dimensional systems. For\nsystems of four or more dimensions, each unit is interacting with sufficiently\nmany neighbors to warrant a mean-field approach. The mean-field approximation\nleads to $\\gamma = 1/2$. In this article we formulate a realistic system of\ncoupled oscillators. Each oscillator moves forward through a cyclic 1D array of\n$n$ states and the rate at which an oscillator proceeds from state $i$ to state\n$i+1$ depends on the populations in states $i+1$ and $i-1$. We study how the\nphase transitions occur from a homogeneous distribution over the states to a\nclustered distribution. A clustered distribution means that oscillators have\nsynchronized. We define an order parameter and we find that the critical\nexponent takes on the mean-field value of 1/2 for any $n$. However, as the\nnumber of states increases, the phase transition occurs for ever smaller values\nof $T_c$. We present rigorous mathematics and simple approximations to develop\nan understanding of the phase transitions in this system. We explain why and\nhow the critical exponent value of 1/2 is expected to be robust and we discuss\na wet-lab experimental setup to substantiate our findings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Mar 2020 14:13:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Mar 2020 04:58:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-17"}

The Seeding method, where the\nsimulations are started with the nucleus already formed, has proven quite\nuseful in efficiently providing estimates of the nucleation rate for a wide\nrange of orders of magnitude. So far, Seeding has been employed in the NPT\nensemble, where the nucleus either grows or redissolves.

The other challenge is that training large\nmachine learning models such as deep neural networks in federated learning\nrequires a large amount of computational resources, which may be unrealistic\nfor edge devices such as mobile phones.

However, most existing approaches\nbuild centralized models on the basis of collecting users' data. Both private\ndata and models are held by the recommender, which causes serious privacy\nconcerns. In this paper, we propose a novel Privacy preserving POI\nRecommendation (PriRec) framework. First, to protect data privacy, users'\nprivate data (features and actions) are kept on their own side, e.g., Cellphone\nor Pad. Meanwhile, the public data need to be accessed by all the users are\nkept by the recommender to reduce the storage costs of users' devices.

The dynamic data could be sensitive, and we develop local differential\nprivacy techniques to release such data to public with privacy guarantees.\nSecond, PriRec follows the representations of Factorization Machine (FM) that\nconsists of linear model and the feature interaction model. To protect the\nmodel privacy, the linear models are saved on users' side, and we propose a\nsecure decentralized gradient descent protocol for users to learn it\ncollaboratively.

To this end, PriRec keeps users' private raw\ndata and models in users' own hands, and protects user privacy to a large\nextent.

As\nmemories contribute an estimated 25% to 40% to the overall power, performance,\nand area (PPA) of a chip, memories must be designed carefully to meet the\nsystem's requirements. Memory arrays are highly uniform and can be described by\napproximately 10 parameters depending mostly on the complexity of the\nperiphery. Thus, to improve PPA utilization, memories are typically generated\nby memory compilers. A key task in the design flow of a chip is to find optimal\nmemory compiler parametrizations which on the one hand fulfill system\nrequirements while on the other hand optimize PPA. Although most compiler\nvendors also provide optimizers for this task, these are often slow or\ninaccurate. To enable efficient optimization in spite of long compiler run\ntimes, we propose training fully connected feed-forward neural networks to\npredict PPA outputs given a memory compiler parametrization. Using an\nexhaustive search-based optimizer framework which obtains neural network\npredictions, PPA-optimal parametrizations are found within seconds after chip\ndesigners have specified their requirements. Average model prediction errors of\nless than 3%, a decision reliability of over 99% and productive usage of the\noptimizer for successful, large volume chip design projects illustrate the\neffectiveness of the approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Mar 2020 13:11:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-13"}

When the flow is, as usual, initially made of two layers, dense\nparticles above, a Rayleigh-Taylor instability develops during the flow. When\nthe flow is initially made of one homogeneous layer mixture, the granular\nsegregation leads to the formation of an unstable layer of large-dense\nparticles at the surface which subsequently destabilizes in a RT plume pattern.\nThe unstable density gradient has been only induced by the motion of the\ngranular matter.

In particular, we give a construction of quasi-pre-Lie bialgebras\nusing symplectic Lie algebras, which is parallel to that a Cartan $3$-form on a\nsemi-simple Lie algebra gives a quasi-Lie bialgebra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Mar 2020 02:02:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Mar 2020 06:09:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-30"}

Its complexity\nmakes conducting performance analysis in that environment fraught with\ndifficulties and emergent behavior. Applications leveraging more \"moving parts\"\nsuch as the Istio service mesh makes the platform strictly more complex, not\nless. In this paper we study how underlying platform constitution and\ndeployment affects application performance, specifically in Kubernetes-based\nenvironments. We alter platform constitution via use of native Kubernetes\nnetworking or Istio. Platform deployment is altered via etcd data storage\nlocation at two extremes on the performance spectrum: network disk and RAM\ndisk. Our results show that etcd performance has a large impact on that of\nKubernetes and its ability to perform orchestration actions, and thereby\nindirectly on the performance of the application. The implication is that\nsystems researchers conducting performance evaluations cannot just consider\ntheir specific application as being under test, but must also take the\nunderlying Kubernetes platform into account. To conduct experiments of\nscientific rigor, we developed an experiment framework for conducting\nrepeatable and reproducible experiments. Our framework and resulting data set\nare openly available for the research community to build upon and reason about.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Mar 2020 08:50:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-02"}
