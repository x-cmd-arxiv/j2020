Thus, performance measurements obtained on\nclouds, HPC facilities, and, more generally, datacenter environments are almost\nguaranteed to exhibit performance regimes that evolve over time, which leads to\nundesirable nonstationarities in application performance. In this paper, we\npresent our analysis of performance of the bare-metal hardware available on the\nCloudLab testbed where we focus on quantifying the evolving performance regimes\nusing changepoint detection. We describe our findings, backed by a dataset with\nnearly 6.9M benchmark results collected from over 1600 machines over a period\nof 2 years and 9 months. These findings yield a comprehensive characterization\nof real-world performance variability patterns in one computing facility, a\nmethodology for studying such patterns on other infrastructures, and contribute\nto a better understanding of performance variability in general.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Mar 2020 16:04:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-11"}

Our result is completely axiomatic: in a general setting, given an\nendomorphism on the cohomology $H^{\\bullet}(X)$, it explains how we can\nexplicitly relate the Lefschetz series of the induced endomorphism on\n$H^{\\bullet}(X^{n})^{G}$ to that of the given endomorphism on $H^{\\bullet}(X)$\nin the presence of the K\\\"unneth formula with respect to a cup product. For\nexample, when $X$ is a compact manifold, we take the Lefschetz series given by\nthe singular cohomology with rational coefficients. On the other hand, when $X$\nis a projective variety over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_{q}$, we use the\n$l$-adic \\'etale cohomology with a suitable choice of prime number $l$. We also\nexplain how our formula generalizes the P\\'olya enumeration theorem, a\nclassical theorem in combinatorics that counts colorings of a graph up to given\nsymmetries, where $X$ is taken to be a finite set of colors. When $X$ is a\nsmooth projective variety over $\\mathbb{C}$, our formula also generalizes a\nresult of Cheah that relates the Hodge numbers of $X^{n}/G$ to those of $X$. We\nwill also see that our result generalizes the following facts: 1. the\ngenerating function of the Poincar\\'e polynomials of symmetric powers of a\ncompact manifold $X$ is rational; 2. the generating function of the\nHodge-Deligne polynomials of symmetric powers of a smooth projective variety\n$X$ over $\\mathbb{C}$ is rational; 3. the zeta series of a projective variety\n$X$ over $\\mathbb{F}_{q}$ is rational.

Most studies in this area model the soft shell interaction as a\nsquare shoulder potential. Although appealing from a theoretical point of view,\nthe potential is physically unrealistic because there is no repulsive force in\nthe soft shell regime, unlike in experimental HCSS systems. To make the model\nmore realistic, here we consider HCSS particles with a range soft shell\npotential profiles beyond the standard square shoulder form and study the model\nusing both minimum energy calculations and Monte Carlo simulations. We find\nthat by tuning density and the soft shell profile, HCSS particles in the thin\nshell regime (i.e., shell to core ratio $r_1/r_0 \\leq \\sqrt{3}$) can form a\nlarge range of structures, including hexagons, chains, squares, rhomboids and\ntwo distinct zig-zag structures. Furthermore, by tuning the density and\n$r_1/r_0$, we find that HCSS particles with experimentally realistic linear\nramp soft shoulder repulsions can form honeycombs and quasicrystals with\n10-fold and 12-fold symmetry. Our study therefore suggests the exciting\npossibility of fabricating these exotic 2D structures experimentally through\ncolloidal self-assembly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Mar 2020 16:22:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-24"}

In this regard, leveraging\nlarge available bandwidth at terahertz frequency bands is seen as a key\nenabler. To overcome the large propagation loss at these very high frequencies,\nit is inevitable to manage transmissions over highly directional links.\nHowever, uncoordinated directional transmissions by a large number of users can\ncause substantial interference in terahertz networks. While such interference\nwill be received over short random time intervals, the received power can be\nlarge. In this work, a new framework based on reinforcement learning is\nproposed that uses an adaptive multi-thresholding strategy to efficiently\ndetect and mitigate the intermittent interference from directional links in the\ntime domain. To find the optimal thresholds, the problem is formulated as a\nmultidimensional multi-armed bandit system. Then, an algorithm is proposed that\nallows the receiver to learn the optimal thresholds with very low complexity.\nAnother key advantage of the proposed approach is that it does not rely on any\nprior knowledge about the interference statistics, and hence, it is suitable\nfor interference mitigation in dynamic scenarios. Simulation results confirm\nthe superior bit-error-rate performance of the proposed method compared with\ntwo traditional time-domain interference mitigation approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Mar 2020 16:28:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-11"}

In this work we provide a solution to\nthis when each node is a qubit and the state of the network is\nsensor-symmetric. First we derive a general expression linking the amount of\ninter-sensor correlations and the geometry of the vectors associated with the\nfunctions, such that the asymptotic error is optimal. Using this we show that\nif the vectors are clustered around two special subspaces, then the optimum is\nachieved when the correlation strength approaches its extreme values, while\nthere is a monotonic transition between such extremes for any other geometry.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that entanglement can be detrimental for estimating\nnon-trivial global properties, and that sometimes it is in fact irrelevant.\nFinally, we perform a non-asymptotic analysis of these results using a Bayesian\napproach, finding that the amount of correlations needed to enhance the\nprecision crucially depends on the number of measurement data.

Recent detections of re-inflated\nwarm Jupiters orbiting post-main-sequence stars and the re-inflation of hot\nJupiters while their host stars evolve on the main-sequence may help constrain\nmodels for the anomalous radii of hot Jupiters. In this work, we present\nevolution models studying the re-inflation of gas giants to determine how\nvarying the depth and intensity of deposited heating affects both main-sequence\nre-inflation of hot Jupiters and post-main-sequence re-inflation of warm\nJupiters. We find that deeper heating is required to re-inflate hot Jupiters\nthan is needed to suppress their cooling, and that the timescale of\nre-inflation decreases with increasing heating rate and depth.

The reliability of egs_lattice, as well as\nEGSnrc in general, is cross-validated and tested. Methods: New Bravais, cubic,\nand hexagonal lattice geometries are defined in egs_lattice and their transport\nalgorithms are described. Simulations of cells and Gold NanoParticle (GNP)\ncontaining cavities are implemented to compare to published Geant4-DNA and\nPENELOPE results. Recursive boundary conditions, implemented through a cubic\nlattice, are used to perform electron Fano cavity tests. Results: Lattices are\nsuccessfully implemented in EGSnrc. EGSnrc calculated doses to cell cytoplasm\nand nucleus when irradiated by an internal electron source with a median\ndifference of 0.6% compared to Geant4-DNA. EGSnrc calculated the ratio of dose\nto a microscopic cavity containing GNPs over dose to a cavity containing a\nhomogeneous mixture of gold, and results generally agree (within 1%) with\nPENELOPE.

By this way, the developed FONBW model has a relatively simple\nmathematic expression with fewer parameters to simultaneously characterize the\nasymmetric and rate-dependent hysteresis behaviors of PEAs. Model parameters\nare identified by the self-adaptive differential evolution algorithm. To\nvalidate the effectiveness of the proposed model, a series of model\nverification and inverse-multiplicative-structure-based feedforward control\nexperiments are carried out on a PEA system. Results show that the proposed\nmodel is superior to the CBW model and traditional modified BW model in\nmodeling accuracy and hysteresis compensation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Mar 2020 18:15:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 16 Aug 2020 19:54:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 21 Nov 2020 00:08:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-13"}

The strategy is to use the ML potential under development\nto sample new atomic configurations and, whenever a configuration is reached\nfor which the ML uncertainty is sufficiently large, collect new QM data. Here,\nwe seek to push the limits of automation, removing as much expert knowledge\nfrom the AL process as possible. All sampling is performed using MD simulations\nstarting from an initially disordered configuration, and undergoing\nnon-equilibrium dynamics as driven by time-varying applied temperatures. We\ndemonstrate this approach by building an ML potential for aluminum (ANI-Al).\nAfter many AL iterations, ANI-Al teaches itself to predict properties like the\nradial distribution function in melt, liquid-solid coexistence curve, and\ncrystal properties such as defect energies and barriers. To demonstrate\ntransferability, we perform a 1.3M atom shock simulation, and show that ANI-Al\npredictions agree very well with DFT calculations on local atomic environments\nsampled from the nonequilibrium dynamics. Interestingly, the configurations\nappearing in shock appear to have been well sampled in the AL training dataset,\nin a way that we illustrate visually.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Mar 2020 19:06:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 17:15:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-28"}

However, a key practical difficulty of sketching an SVD is\nthat the user does not know how far the sketched singular vectors/values are\nfrom the exact ones. Indeed, the user may be forced to rely on analytical\nworst-case error bounds, which do not account for the unique structure of a\ngiven problem. As a result, the lack of tools for error estimation often leads\nto much more computation than is really necessary. To overcome these\nchallenges, this paper develops a fully data-driven bootstrap method that\nnumerically estimates the actual error of sketched singular vectors/values. In\nparticular, this allows the user to inspect the quality of a rough initial\nsketched SVD, and then adaptively predict how much extra work is needed to\nreach a given error tolerance. Furthermore, the method is computationally\ninexpensive, because it operates only on sketched objects, and it requires no\npasses over the full matrix being factored. Lastly, the method is supported by\ntheoretical guarantees and a very encouraging set of experimental results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Mar 2020 19:14:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-12"}

The analysis is in the context of $\\beta$-plane\nMHD, with a special focus on the physics of momentum transport in the stably\nstratified, quasi-2D solar tachocline. A physical picture of mean PV evolution\nby vorticity advection and tilting of magnetic fields is proposed. In the case\nof weak-field perturbations, quasi-linear theory predicts that the Reynolds and\nmagnetic stresses balance as turbulence Alfv\\'enizes for a larger mean magnetic\nfield. Jet formation is explored quantitatively in the mean field-resistivity\nparameter space. However, since even a modest mean magnetic field leads to\nlarge magnetic perturbations for large magnetic Reynolds number, the physically\nrelevant case is that of a strong but disordered field. We show that numerical\ncalculations indicate that the Reynolds stress is modified well before\nAlfv\\'enization -- i.e. before fluid and magnetic energies balance. To\nunderstand these trends, a double-average model of PV mixing in a stochastic\nmagnetic field is developed. Calculations indicate that mean-square fields\nstrongly modify Reynolds stress phase coherence and also induce a magnetic drag\non zonal flows. The physics of transport reduction by tangled fields is\nelucidated and linked to the related quench of turbulent resistivity.

This representation of Feng & Gallo of the Galaxy with a dark disc\ninstead of a dark halo is controversial.\n  When we analyse the effect of flares on rotation curves, the thin disc\napproximation fails, and we need to introduce a vertical dimension to measure\nand predict the effects of the flare through different heights. Just by\nspreading the mass perpendicularly to the plane -- without adding any further\nmass -- the flare provokes no severe changes on the rotation curve. The flare\nmainly provokes a faster velocity decrease in the outer part of the Galaxy\n($r\\gtrsim 14$ kpc). But we also have obtained a slight velocity increase in\nthe first kiloparsecs after the starting point of the flare.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Mar 2020 20:02:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Mar 2020 16:05:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-16"}

However, RL still\nrequires the robot to collect a large amount of real-world experience. To\naddress this problem, recent works have proposed learning from expert\ndemonstrations (LfD), particularly via inverse reinforcement learning (IRL),\ngiven its ability to achieve robust performance with only a small number of\nexpert demonstrations. Nevertheless, deploying IRL on real robots is still\nchallenging due to the large number of robot experiences it requires. This\npaper aims to address this scalability challenge with a robust,\nsample-efficient, and general meta-IRL algorithm, SQUIRL, that performs a new\nbut related long-horizon task robustly given only a single video demonstration.\nFirst, this algorithm bootstraps the learning of a task encoder and a\ntask-conditioned policy using behavioral cloning (BC). It then collects\nreal-robot experiences and bypasses reward learning by directly recovering a\nQ-function from the combined robot and expert trajectories. Next, this\nalgorithm uses the Q-function to re-evaluate all cumulative experiences\ncollected by the robot to improve the policy quickly. In the end, the policy\nperforms more robustly (90%+ success) than BC on new tasks while requiring no\ntrial-and-errors at test time. Finally, our real-robot and simulated\nexperiments demonstrate our algorithm's generality across different state\nspaces, action spaces, and vision-based manipulation tasks, e.g.,\npick-pour-place and pick-carry-drop.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Mar 2020 20:26:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-12"}

What is not clear from previous research is whether this is more a result\nof voters being unable to do so accurately or whether this is because voters\nsimply choose not to attempt verification in the first place. In order to\nunderstand this problem, we conducted an experiment in which 108 participants\nparticipated in a mock election where the BMD displayed the voters' true\nchoices, but then changed a subset of those choices on the printed ballot. The\ndesign of the printed ballot, the length of the ballot, the number of changes\nthat were made to the ballot, the location of those changes, and the\ninstructions provided to the voters were manipulated as part of the experiment.\nResults indicated that of those voters who chose to examine the printed ballot,\n76% detected anomalies, indicating that voters can reliably detect errors on\ntheir ballot if they will simply review it. This suggests that administrative\nremedies, rather than attempts to alter fundamental human perceptual\ncapabilities, could be employed to encourage voters to check their ballots,\nwhich could prove as an effective countermeasure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Mar 2020 21:06:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-12"}

Three different scenarios were examined: both clouds initially bound,\none cloud bound and one unbound, and both clouds initially unbound. Models in\nwhich one or both clouds are bound generate filamentary structures aligned\nalong the collision axis and discernible in position-position and\nposition--velocity space. If neither cloud is bound, no filaments result.\nUnlike in previous simulations of collisions between smooth clouds, owing to\nthe substructure created in the clouds by turbulence before the collisions,\ndissipation of kinetic energy by the collision is very inefficient and in none\nof our simulations is sufficient bulk kinetic energy lost to render the clouds\nbound. Simulations where both clouds are bound created twice as much stellar\nmass than the bound-unbound model, and both these scenarios produced much more\nstellar mass than the simulation in which both clouds are unbound. Each\nsimulation was also compared with a control run in which the clouds do not\ncollide.

Here, we propose models which predict the\nbehavior of deposited lines at corners for moderate viscosity inks which are\nimpacted by both capillarity and viscous dissipation. Using direct ink writing\nwith acoustophoresis and a Carbopol-based support gel, we write polygons out of\ndental resin-based composite inks containing a narrow distribution of\nmicroparticles at the center of the filament. A Laplace pressure differential\nbetween the inner and outer surfaces of the corner drives corner smoothing,\nwherein the inner radius of the corner increases. Double deposition, or\nprinting on the same area twice, drives corner swelling, wherein excess ink is\ndiverted to the outer edge of the corner. Fast turns at corners produce\nringing, wherein vibrations in the stage manifest in oscillations in the print\npath. Swelling and ringing effects are apparent in the particle distributions\nat corners immediately after deposition, while smoothing effects are apparent\nafter the printed structure has had time to relax. When the nozzle returns to\nwrite a neighboring line, it imposes shear stresses which mitigate\ninconsistencies in microstructure at corners by erasing defects which appeared\nduring relaxation.

To optimize proposed beamformers,\npartial channel information is needed, and the use of low overhead pilot\nsequences is also proposed to figure out the required information. Simulation\nresults verify that the resulting beamformers have the most uniform gain (with\nthe squared error criterion) or the highest average gain (with the magnitude of\ninner product criterion) in the covering region with the UPA of\ndual-polarization antennas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Mar 2020 00:49:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-28"}

New opportunities will be offered by\ncreating longitudinal brain atlases from longitudinal subject-specific image\ndata, where explicit modeling of subject's variability in slope and intercept\nleads to a more robust estimation of average trajectories but also to estimates\nof confidence bounds. This work focuses on a framework to build a continuous 4D\natlas from longitudinal high angular resolution diffusion images (HARDI) where,\nunlike atlases of derived scalar diffusion indices such as FA, statistics on\ndODFs is preserved. Multi-scalar images obtained from DW images are used for\ngeometric alignment, and linear mixed-effects modeling from longitudinal\ndiffusion orientation distribution functions (dODF) leads to estimation of\ncontinuous dODF changes. The proposed method is applied to a longitudinal\ndataset of HARDI images from healthy developing infants in the age range of 3\nto 36 months. Verification of mixed-effects modeling is obtained by voxel-wise\ngoodness of fit calculations. To demonstrate the potential of our method, we\ndisplay changes of longitudinal atlas using dODF and derived generalized\nfractional anisotropy (GFA) of dODF. We also investigate white matter\nmaturation patterns in genu, body, and splenium of the corpus callosum.

This problem applies to any state-of-the-art physics or\nengineering models that have a computational cost that does not readily allow\nto run ensembles and to estimate the uncertainty associated to single-point\npredictions. Essentially, we devise a method to easily transform a\ndeterministic prediction into a probabilistic one. We show that for doing so,\none has to compromise between the accuracy and the reliability (calibration) of\nsuch a probabilistic model. Hence, we introduce a cost function that encodes\ntheir trade-off. We use the Continuous Rank Probability Score to measure\naccuracy and we derive an analytic formula for the reliability, in the case of\nforecasts of continuous scalar variables expressed in terms of Gaussian\ndistributions. The new Accuracy-Reliability cost function is then used to\nestimate the input-dependent variance, given a black-box mean function, by\nsolving a two-objective optimization problem. The simple philosophy behind this\nstrategy is that predictions based on the estimated variances should not only\nbe accurate, but also reliable (i.e. statistical consistent with observations).\nConversely, early works based on the minimization of classical cost functions,\nsuch as the negative log probability density, cannot simultaneously enforce\nboth accuracy and reliability.

Compared to traditional distributed databases,\nblockchain platforms provide increased security guarantees but significantly\nlower performance. Further, these platforms are quite expensive to run for the\nlow throughput they provide. The following are two ways to improve performance\nand reduce cost: (1) make the system utilize allocated resources efficiently;\n(2) allow rapid and dynamic scaling of allocated resources based on load. We\nexplore both of these in this work.\n  We first investigate the reasons for the poor performance and scalability of\nthe dominant permissioned blockchain flavor called Execute-Order-Validate\n(EOV). We do this by studying the scaling characteristics of Hyperledger\nFabric, a popular EOV platform, using vertical scaling and horizontal scaling.\nWe find that the transaction throughput scales very poorly with these\ntechniques. At least in the permissioned setting, the real bottleneck is\ntransaction processing, not the consensus protocol. With vertical scaling, the\nallocated vCPUs go under-utilized. In contrast, with horizontal scaling, the\nallocated resources get wasted due to redundant work across nodes within an\norganization.\n  To mitigate the above concerns, we first improve resource efficiency by (a)\nimproving CPU utilization with a pipelined execution of validation & commit\nphases; (b) avoiding redundant work across nodes by introducing a new type of\npeer node called sparse peer that selectively commits transactions. We further\npropose a technique that enables the rapid scaling of resources.

Long articulated soft robots enable diverse operations, and\ntip-extending robots that navigate their environment through growth are highly\neffective in robotic search applications. Because the robot membrane extends\nfrom the tip, these robots can lengthen without friction from the environment.\nHowever, the flexibility of the membrane inhibits tip retraction. Two methods\nhave been proposed to resolve this issue; increasing the pressure of the\ninternal fluid to reinforce rigidity, and mounting an actuator at the tip. The\ndisadvantage of the former is that the increase is limited by the membrane\npressure resistance, while the second method adds to the robot complexity. In\nthis paper, we present a tip-retraction mechanism without bending motion that\ntakes advantage of the friction from the external environment. Water is used as\nthe internal fluid to increase ground pressure with the environment.

Roughly speaking, they\nundergo a transition between a delocalized phase and a localized one. In\nmathematical terms these models are obtained by modifying the distribution of a\ndiscrete renewal process via a Boltzmann factor with an energy that contains\nonly one body potentials. For some more complex models, notably pinning models\nbased on higher dimensional renewals, it has been shown that other phases may\nbe present. We study a generalization of the one dimensional pinning model in\nwhich the energy may depend in a nonlinear way on the contact fraction: this\nclass of models contains the circular DNA case considered in the bio-physics\nliterature. We give a full solution of this generalized pinning model in\nabsence of disorder and show that another transition appears. In fact the\nsystems may display up to three different regimes: delocalization, partial\nlocalization and full localization. What happens in the partially localized\nregime can be explained in terms of the \"big-jump\" phenomenon for sums of heavy\ntail random variables under conditioning. We then show that disorder completely\nsmears this second transition and we are back to the delocalization versus\nlocalization scenario. In fact we show that the disorder, even if arbitrarily\nweak, is incompatible with the presence of a big-jump.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Mar 2020 07:30:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-02"}

Focusing on dual-criticality systems, algorithms based on the fluid\nscheduling model have been proposed in the past. These algorithms use a\ndual-rate execution model for each high-criticality task depending on the\nsystem mode. Once the system switches to the high-criticality mode, the\nexecution rates of such tasks are increased to meet their increased demand.\nAlthough these algorithms are speed-up optimal, they are unable to schedule\nseveral feasible dual-criticality task systems. This is because a single fixed\nexecution rate for each high-criticality task after the mode switch is not\nefficient to handle the high variability in demand during the transition period\nimmediately following the mode switch. This demand variability exists as long\nas the carry-over jobs of high-criticality tasks, that is jobs released before\nthe mode switch, have not completed. Addressing this shortcoming, we propose a\nmulti-rate fluid execution model for dual-criticality task systems in this\npaper. Under this model, high-criticality tasks are allocated varying execution\nrates in the transition period after the mode switch to efficiently handle the\ndemand variability. We derive a sufficient schedulability test for the proposed\nmodel and show its dominance over the dual-rate fluid execution model. Further,\nwe also present a speed-up optimal rate assignment strategy for the multi-rate\nmodel, and experimentally show that the proposed model outperforms all the\nexisting MC scheduling algorithms with known speed-up bounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Mar 2020 08:58:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-12"}

MOSARIX is a project of an x-ray spectrometer\nin the tender x-ray domain (2-5 keV) with high efficiency, allowing performing\nx-ray emission and coincidences (or covariance mapping) experiments using\nsynchrotron radiation, XFEL, the future installation SPIRAL2/GANIL or\nCRYRING/FAIR.

In order to solve these inference\nproblems, probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) employ different inference\nalgorithms, such as sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), Markov chain Monte Carlo\n(MCMC), or variational methods. Existing research on such algorithms mainly\nconcerns their implementation and efficiency, rather than the correctness of\nthe algorithms themselves when applied in the context of expressive PPLs. To\nremedy this, we give a correctness proof for SMC methods in the context of an\nexpressive PPL calculus, representative of popular PPLs such as WebPPL,\nAnglican, and Birch. Previous work have studied correctness of MCMC using an\noperational semantics, and correctness of SMC and MCMC in a denotational\nsetting without term recursion. However, for SMC inference -- one of the most\ncommonly used algorithms in PPLs as of today -- no formal correctness proof\nexists in an operational setting. In particular, an open question is if the\nresample locations in a probabilistic program affects the correctness of SMC.\nWe solve this fundamental problem, and make four novel contributions: (i) we\nextend an untyped PPL lambda calculus and operational semantics to include\nexplicit resample terms, expressing synchronization points in SMC inference;\n(ii) we prove, for the first time, that subject to mild restrictions, any\nplacement of the explicit resample terms is valid for a generic form of SMC\ninference; (iii) as a result of (ii), our calculus benefits from classic\nresults from the SMC literature: a law of large numbers and an unbiased\nestimate of the model evidence; and (iv) we formalize the bootstrap particle\nfilter for the calculus and discuss how our results can be further extended to\nother SMC algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Mar 2020 09:53:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Mar 2021 18:25:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 3 May 2023 12:09:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-04"}

Two natural questions that arise in\nthis context are: (1) whether the results extend to the Fiat-Shamir\ntransformation of multi-round interactive proofs, and (2) whether Don et al.'s\n$O(q^2)$ loss in security is optimal.\n  Firstly, we answer question (1) in the affirmative. As a byproduct of solving\na technical difficulty in proving this result, we slightly improve the result\nof Don et al., equipping it with a cleaner bound and an even simpler proof. We\napply our result to digital signature schemes showing that it can be used to\nprove strong security for schemes like MQDSS in the QROM. As another\napplication we prove QROM-security of a non-interactive OR proof by Liu, Wei\nand Wong.\n  As for question (2), we show via a Grover-search based attack that Don et\nal.'s quadratic security loss for the Fiat-Shamir transformation of\n$\\Sigma$-protocols is optimal up to a small constant factor. This extends to\nour new multi-round result, proving it tight up to a factor that depends on the\nnumber of rounds only, i.e. is constant for any constant-round interactive\nproof.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Mar 2020 10:33:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2020 09:49:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 7 Mar 2022 11:53:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-08"}

From the\nliterature review, it is investigated that most of the researchers used raw and\nenergy features (time domain features) of the signal data as those are most\ndiscriminating. However, in real life situations fall signal may be noisy than\nthe current simulated data. Hence the result using raw feature may dramatically\nchanges when using in a real life scenario. This research is using frequency\ndomain Fourier coefficient features to differentiate various human activities\nof daily life. The feature vector constructed using those Fast Fourier\nTransform are robust to noise and rotation invariant. Two different supervised\nclassifiers kNN and SVM are used for evaluating the method. Two standard\npublicly available datasets are used for benchmark analysis. In this research,\nmore discriminating results are obtained applying kNN classifier than the SVM\nclassifier. Various standard measure including Standard Accuracy (SA), Macro\nAverage Accuracy (MAA), Sensitivity (SE) and Specificity (SP) has been\naccounted.

We investigate the formation of small scales and the dissipation of MHD\nwave energy through non-linear interactions of counter-propagating, phase-mixed\nAlfvenic waves in a complex magnetic field. Methods. We conducted fully 3-D,\nnon-ideal MHD simulations of transverse waves in complex magnetic fields.\nContinuous wave drivers were imposed on the foot points of magnetic field lines\nand the system was evolved for several Alfven travel times. Phase-mixed waves\nwere allowed to reflect off the upper boundary and the interactions between the\nresultant counter-streaming wave packets were analysed. Results. The complex\nnature of the background magnetic field encourages the development of phase\nmixing, leading to a growth in currents and vorticities. Counter-propagating\nphase-mixed waves induce a cascade of energy to small scales and result in more\nefficient energy dissipation. This effect is enhanced in simulations with more\ncomplex magnetic fields. High-frequency drivers excite localised field line\nresonances and produce efficient wave heating. However, this relies on the\nformation of large amplitude oscillations on resonant field lines. Drivers with\nsmaller frequencies than the fundamental frequencies of field lines are not\nable to excite resonances and thus do not inject sufficient Poynting flux to\npower coronal heating. Even in the case of high-frequency oscillations, the\nrate of dissipation is likely too slow to balance coronal energy losses, even\nwithin the quiet Sun. Conclusions. For the generalised phase-mixing presented\nhere, complex background field structures enhance the rate of wave energy\ndissipation. However, it remains difficult for realistic wave drivers to inject\nsufficient Poynting flux to heat the corona. Indeed, significant heating only\noccurs in cases which exhibit amplitudes that are much larger than those\ncurrently observed in the solar atmosphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Mar 2020 11:40:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-15"}

For a single image, a self-channel interaction (SCI) module is proposed\nto explore channel-wise correlation within the image. This allows the model to\nlearn the complementary features from the correlated channels, yielding\nstronger fine-grained features. Furthermore, given an image pair, we introduce\na contrastive channel interaction (CCI) module to model the cross-sample\nchannel interaction with a metric learning framework, allowing the CIN to\ndistinguish the subtle visual differences between images.

An RDF graph comprises entities of the same type connected to\nobjects or other entities using labeled edges annotated with properties. RDF\ngraphs usually contain entities that share the same objects in a certain group\nof properties, i.e., they match star patterns composed of these properties and\nobjects. In case the number of these entities or properties in these star\npatterns is large, the size of the RDF graph and query processing are\nnegatively impacted; we refer these star patterns as frequent star patterns. We\naddress the problem of identifying frequent star patterns in RDF graphs and\ndevise the concept of factorized RDF graphs, which denote compact\nrepresentations of RDF graphs where the number of frequent star patterns is\nminimized. We also develop computational methods to identify frequent star\npatterns and generate a factorized RDF graph, where compact RDF molecules\nreplace frequent star patterns. A compact RDF molecule of a frequent star\npattern denotes an RDF subgraph that instantiates the corresponding star\npattern. Instead of having all the entities matching the original frequent star\npattern, a surrogate entity is added and related to the properties of the\nfrequent star pattern; it is linked to the entities that originally match the\nfrequent star pattern.

We define the\nintegrated unitary operations of an HRE quantum memory, prove the learning\nprocedure, and evaluate the achievable output signal-to-noise ratio values. We\nprove that the local unitaries of an HRE quantum memory achieve the\noptimization of the readout procedure in an unsupervised manner without the use\nof any labeled data or training sequences. We show that the readout procedure\nof an HRE quantum memory is realized in a completely blind manner without any\ninformation about the input quantum system or about the unknown quantum\noperation of the quantum register. We evaluate the retrieval efficiency of an\nHRE quantum memory and the output SNR (signal-to-noise ratio). The results are\nparticularly convenient for gate-model quantum computers and the near-term\nquantum devices of the quantum Internet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Mar 2020 12:01:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-12"}

We are\ninterested in understanding why only the sectoral modes are seen in the\nobservations and also in modelling the radial structure of the observed modes.\nTo do so, we characterise here the radial eigenfunctions of r modes for\nslowly-rotating polytropes in uniform rotation. We find that for free-surface\nboundary conditions on a spheroid of non-vanishing surface density, r modes can\nonly exist for $\\ell=m$ spherical harmonics in the inviscid case, and we\ncompute their depth dependence and frequencies to leading order. For\nquasi-adiabatic stratification the sectoral modes with no radial nodes are the\nonly modes which are almost toroidal and the depth dependence of the\ncorresponding horizontal motion scales as $r^m$. For all r modes except the\nzero radial order sectoral ones, non-adiabatic stratification plays a crucial\nrole in the radial force balance. The lack of quasi-toroidal solutions when\nstratification is close to neutral, except for the sectoral modes without nodes\nin radius, follows from the statement that the system needs to be in both\nhorizontal and radial force balance. In the absence of super- or subadiabatic\nstratification and viscosity, both the horizontal and radial force balances\nindependently determine the pressure perturbation. The only quasi-toroidal\ncases in which the two determinations of the pressure perturbation are\nconsistent are the special cases where $\\ell=m$, and the horizontal\ndisplacement scales with $r^m$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Mar 2020 13:25:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-20"}

The gradient nanostructures are formed by stacking phenolic\nnanoparticles with gradually enlarged diameters as the distance from the upper\nsurface increases. The use of poloxamers for creating gelation surroundings is\nof great significance for controlling the growth of phenolic nanoparticles,\nwhich in turn dictates the performance of the phenolic membranes thus-produced.\nHence, a study of the effects of poloxamers species on the preparation of the\nphenolic membranes is highly demanded since such robust membranes have much\npotential to be scale up for mass production. Herein, the poloxamer Pluronic\nF127 (EO106-PO70-EO106; EO = ethyleneoxide, PO = propyleneoxide) was introduced\nin the membrane-forming formulations. As opposed to P123 (EO20-PO70-EO20) that\nwe used previously, F127 possessing extended PEO chains can delay the gelation\nduring membrane formation. Hence, the phenolic nucleates are able to grow for\nlonger durations, leading to the generation of more distinct gradient\nnanostructures in the phenolic membranes. Enhanced permeance can then be\nrealized with F127-derived phenolic membranes. We also demonstrate that L31\n(EO1-PO22-EO1) with merely single terminal EO units at the ends of the PPO\nblock could be used to prepare gradient phenolic membranes.

From an\nab initio simulation perspective, this requires accurate calculations including\nmany thousands of atoms; a task well beyond the remit of traditional plane\nwave-based density functional theory (DFT). We suggest that this void can be\nfilled using the methodology implemented in the large-scale DFT code, CONQUEST,\nusing a local pseudoatomic orbital (PAO) basis. Whilst this basis has been\ntested before for some structural and energetic properties, none have treated\nthe most fundamental quantity to the theory, the charge density $n(\\mathbf{r})$\nitself. An accurate description of $n(\\mathbf{r})$ is vital to the perovskite\noxides due to the crucial role played by short-range restoring forces\n(characterised by bond covalency) and long range coulomb forces as suggested by\nthe soft-mode theory of Cochran and Anderson. We find that modestly sized basis\nsets of PAOs can reproduce the plane-wave charge density to a total integrated\nerror of better than 0.5% and provide Bader partitioned ionic charges, volumes\nand average charge densities to similar degree of accuracy. Further, the\nmulti-mode antiferroelectric distortion of PbZrO$_3$ and its associated\nenergetics are reproduced by better than 99% when compared to plane-waves.

In this way, the aggregator can\ntrade the reserve coming from several load units, being the only interface to\nthe market.

The common denominator of these algorithms is to discard low\ncritical tasks whenever high critical tasks are in lack of computation\nresources. This is achieved upon a switch of the scheduling mode from Normal to\nCritical. We distinguish two main categories of the algorithms: system-level\nmode switch and task-level mode switch. System-level mode algorithms allow low\ncriticality (LC) tasks to execute only in normal mode. Task-level mode switch\nalgorithms enable to switch the mode of an individual high criticality task\n(HC), from low (LO) to high (HI), to obtain priority over all LC tasks. This\npaper investigates an online scheduling algorithm for mixed-criticality systems\nthat supports dynamic mode switches for both task level and system level. When\na HC task job overruns its LC budget, then only that particular job is switched\nto HI mode. If the job cannot be accommodated, then the system switches to\nCritical mode. To accommodate for resource availability of the HC jobs, the LC\ntasks are degraded by stretching their periods until the Critical mode\nexhibiting job complete its execution. The stretching will be carried out until\nthe resource availability is met. We have mechanized and implemented the\nproposed algorithm using Uppaal.

We develop two new partitioning strategies based on the principle\nof evenly distributing the difference between total high-critical utilization\nand total low-critical utilization for the critical tasks among all processors.\nBy balancing this difference, we are able to reduce the pessimism in\nuniprocessor MC schedulability tests that are applied on each processor, thus\nimproving overall schedulability. To evaluate the schedulability performance of\nthe proposed strategies, we compare them against existing partitioned\nalgorithms using extensive experiments. We show that the proposed strategies\nare effective with both dynamic-priority Earliest Deadline First with Virtual\nDeadlines (EDF-VD) and fixed-priority Adaptive Mixed-Criticality (AMC)\nalgorithms.

Unlike the realistic visual images,\nthe face recognition of the caricatures is far from the performance of the\nvisual images.

The heterogeneous modalities of the caricatures and the visual\nimages result the caricature-visual face recognition is a cross-modal problem.\nIn this paper, we propose a method to conduct caricature-visual face\nrecognition via multi-task learning.

Indeed,\nbuilding sensing data provides a promising way to enrich a series of\ndata-demanding and cost-expensive urban mobile applications. In this paper, we\nstudy how to reuse building sensing data to predict traffic volume on nearby\nroads. Nevertheless, it is non-trivial to achieve accurate prediction on such\ncross-domain data with two major challenges. First, relationships between\nbuilding sensing data and traffic data are not unknown as prior, and the\nspatio-temporal complexities impose more difficulties to uncover the underlying\nreasons behind the above relationships. Second, it is even more daunting to\naccurately predict traffic volume with dynamic building-traffic correlations,\nwhich are cross-domain, non-linear, and time-varying. To address the above\nchallenges, we design and implement BuildSenSys, a first-of-its-kind system for\nnearby traffic volume prediction by reusing building sensing data. First, we\nconduct a comprehensive building-traffic analysis based on multi-source\ndatasets, disclosing how and why building sensing data is correlated with\nnearby traffic volume. Second, we propose a novel recurrent neural network for\ntraffic volume prediction based on cross-domain learning with two attention\nmechanisms. Specifically, a cross-domain attention mechanism captures the\nbuilding-traffic correlations and adaptively extracts the most relevant\nbuilding sensing data at each predicting step. Then, a temporal attention\nmechanism is employed to model the temporal dependencies of data across\nhistorical time intervals. The extensive experimental studies demonstrate that\nBuildSenSys outperforms all baseline methods with up to 65.3% accuracy\nimprovement (e.g., 2.2% MAPE) in predicting nearby traffic volume.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Mar 2020 11:42:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-17"}

To ensure sufficient\nbudget for high-criticality applications at all times, we use offline\nschedulability analysis to determine a system-wide total low-criticality budget\nallocation for all the high-criticality applications combined. This total\nbudget is used as guidance in our model to determine the need for a\nmode-switch. The runtime strategy then distributes this total budget among the\nvarious applications depending on their execution requirement and with the\nobjective of postponing mode-switch as much as possible. We show that this\nruntime strategy is able to postpone mode-switches for a longer time than any\nstrategy that uses a fixed low-criticality budget allocation for each\napplication. Finally, since we are able to control the total budget allocation\nfor high-criticality applications before mode-switch, we also propose\ntechniques to determine these budgets considering system-wide objectives such\nas schedulability and service guarantee for low-criticality applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Mar 2020 04:03:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-19"}

In this paper, we propose a real-time high-performance DCNN-based\nmethod for robust semantic segmentation of urban street scenes, which achieves\na good trade-off between accuracy and speed. Specifically, a Lightweight\nBaseline Network with Atrous convolution and Attention (LBN-AA) is firstly used\nas our baseline network to efficiently obtain dense feature maps. Then, the\nDistinctive Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (DASPP), which exploits the\ndifferent sizes of pooling operations to encode the rich and distinctive\nsemantic information, is developed to detect objects at multiple scales.\nMeanwhile, a Spatial detail-Preserving Network (SPN) with shallow convolutional\nlayers is designed to generate high-resolution feature maps preserving the\ndetailed spatial information. Finally, a simple but practical Feature Fusion\nNetwork (FFN) is used to effectively combine both shallow and deep features\nfrom the semantic branch (DASPP) and the spatial branch (SPN), respectively.\nExtensive experimental results show that the proposed method respectively\nachieves the accuracy of 73.6% and 68.0% mean Intersection over Union (mIoU)\nwith the inference speed of 51.0 fps and 39.3 fps on the challenging Cityscapes\nand CamVid test datasets (by only using a single NVIDIA TITAN X card).
