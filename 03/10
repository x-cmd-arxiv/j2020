The proposed approach removes this\nlimitation by converting the initialization problem to a Perspective-n-Point\n(PnP) problem with the introduction of semantic centroids (SCs). The\nclosed-form solution of this PnP problem has been well researched and can be\nfound with existing PnP methods. Since the semantic centroid of the point cloud\nusually does not accurately match with that of the corresponding image, the\naccuracy of parameters are not improved even after a nonlinear refinement\nprocess. Thus, a cost function based on the constraint of the correspondence\nbetween semantic elements from both point cloud and image data is formulated.\nSubsequently, optimal extrinsic parameters are estimated by minimizing the cost\nfunction. We evaluate the proposed method either with GT or predicted semantics\non KITTI dataset. Experimental results and comparisons with the baseline method\nverify the feasibility of the initialization strategy and the accuracy of the\ncalibration approach.

With each\niteration 1) the labeled dataset grows, 2) the generality of the classification\nmethod and its accuracy increases, and 3) manual effort is reduced. We\nevaluated the effectiveness of our system, by applying it on over a million\nimages documenting human decomposition.

An economic\nchallenge arises in the presence of strategic agents' private information.\nExisting studies proposed (economic) mechanisms but largely neglected the issue\nof large-scale implementation. Specifically, they require certain modifications\nto the deployed algorithms, which may bring the significant cost. To tackle\nthis challenge, we present the large-scale Vickery-Clark-Grove (VCG) Mechanism\nfor NUM, with a simpler payment rule characterized by the shadow prices. The\nLarge-Scale VCG Mechanism maximizes the network utility and achieves individual\nrationality and budget balance. With infinitely many agents, agents' truthful\nreports of their types are their dominant strategies; for the finite case, each\nagent's incentive to misreport converges quadratically to zero. For practical\nimplementation, we introduce a modified mechanism that possesses an additional\nimportant technical property, superimposability, which makes it able to be\nbuilt upon any (potentially distributed) algorithm that optimally solves the\nNUM Problem and ensures all agents to obey the algorithm.

The\nconditions under which, in this model, the speed of gravitational waves becomes\nequal to the speed of light (equal to one, in natural units), thus becoming\ncompatible with the striking event GW170817, is investigated.

Our analysis\nuncovers that some commonly-used heuristics for super-net training negatively\nimpact the correlation between super-net and stand-alone performance, and\nevidences the strong influence of certain hyperparameters and architectural\nchoices. Our code and experiments set a strong and reproducible baseline that\nfuture works can build on.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Mar 2020 17:34:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Jun 2020 13:42:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-18"}

It is unclear how, where,\nand when current sheets form in black-hole accretion disks. We perform\naxisymmetric general-relativistic resistive magnetohydrodynamics simulations to\nmodel reconnection and plasmoid formation in a range of accretion flows.\nCurrent sheets and plasmoids are ubiquitous features which form regardless of\nthe initial magnetic field in the disk, the magnetization in the\nquasi-steady-state phase of accretion, and the spin of the black hole.

VANET facilitate vehicles to\nshare safety and non-safety information through messages. Safety information\nincludes road accidents, natural hazards, roadblocks, etc. Non-safety\ninformation includes tolling information, traveler information, etc. The main\ngoal behind sharing this information is to enhance road safety and reduce road\naccidents by alerting the driver about the unexpected hazards. However, routing\nof messages in VANET is challenging due to packet delays arising from high\nmobility of vehicles, frequently changing topology and high density of\nvehicles, leading to frequent route breakages and packet losses. This report\nsummarizes the performance analysis of safety and non-safety message\ndissemination techniques in VANET based on the fog computing technique. Three\nmain metrics to improve the performance of message dissemination are: 1) delay,\n2) probability of message delivery, and 3) throughput. Analysis of such metrics\nplays an important role to improve the performance of existing message\ndissemination techniques. Simulations are usually conducted based on the\nmetrics using ns-2 and Java discrete event simulator. The above three\nperformance metrics and results published in literature help one to understand\nand increase the performance of various message dissemination techniques in a\nVANET environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Mar 2020 18:42:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-11"}

We first reproduce the old result with an exact algorithm (not known at\nthe time) and with statistics larger by an order of magnitude. As an extension\nof the old analysis we introduce stout smearing in the fermion action in order\nto reduce the finite lattice spacing effects. First we show that increasing the\nsmearing parameter $\\rho$ the crossover at $\\mu = 0$ gets weaker, i.e., the\nleading Fisher zero gets farther away from the real axis. Furthermore as the\nchemical potential is increased the overlap problem gets severe sooner than in\nthe unimproved case, therefore shrinking the range of applicability of the\nmethod. Nevertheless certain qualitative features remain, even after\nintroducing the smearing. Namely, at small chemical potentials the Fisher zeros\nfirst get farther away from the real axis and later at around $a\\mu _q = 0.1 -\n0.15$ they start to get closer, i.e., the crossover first gets weaker and later\nstronger as a function of $\\mu$.

In this paper, we consider the simplest\nscenario where a large superadditive capacity is known: a pure-loss channel\nwith a coherent-state binary phase-shift keyed (BPSK) modulation. The two BPSK\nstates can be mapped conceptually to two non-orthogonal states of a qubit,\ndescribed by an inner product that is a function of the mean photon number per\npulse. Using this map, we derive an explicit construction of the quantum\ncircuit of a joint-detection receiver based on a recent idea of\n\"belief-propagation with quantum messages\" (BPQM) (arXiv:1607.04833). We\nquantify its performance improvement over the Dolinar receiver that performs\noptimal pulse-by-pulse detection, which represents the best \"classical\"\napproach. We analyze the scheme rigorously and show that it achieves the\nquantum limit of minimum average error probability in discriminating 8 (BPSK)\ncodewords of a length-5 binary linear code with a tree factor graph. Our result\nsuggests that a BPQM-receiver might attain the Holevo capacity of this\nBPSK-modulated pure-loss channel. Moreover, our receiver circuit provides an\nalternative proposal for a quantum supremacy experiment, targeted at a specific\napplication that can potentially be implemented on a small, special-purpose,\nphotonic quantum computer capable of performing cat-basis universal qubit\nlogic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Mar 2020 18:44:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 May 2021 16:52:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-20"}

We discuss the main experimental probes and give an extensive\naccount of theoretical approaches to understand the order parameter symmetries\nand the corresponding pairing mechanisms including the importance of multiple\nbands.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Mar 2020 18:47:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-21"}

Motion capture systems are typically utilized indoors when\naccurate localization is needed. However, these systems are expensive and most\nrequire a fixed setup. Recently, visual-inertial odometry and similar methods\nhave advanced to a point where autonomous UAVs can rely on them for\nlocalization.

Here we show that for skyrmions\ndriven over a two-dimensional periodic obstacle array with a dc drive and an ac\ndrive that is either parallel or perpendicular to the dc drive, the system\nexhibits numerous transverse and longitudinal synchronization dynamics due to\nthe Magnus force. These phenomena originate in interactions between two\ndifferent types of phase locking effects: Shapiro steps and directional\nlocking. In some cases, the skyrmion Hall angle is constant but longitudinal\nShapiro steps appear, while in other regimes the skyrmion Hall angle can either\nincrease or decrease with increasing dc drive during the phase locking as the\nskyrmion locks to different symmetry directions of the obstacle lattice. For a\ntransverse ac drive we find that strong Hall angle overshoots can occur in\ncertain locked phases where the skyrmion is moving at an angle that is\nconsiderably larger than the intrinsic Hall angle. For the strongest Magnus\nforce, the phase locking effects are reduced and there are larger regions of\ndisordered dynamics.

In recent\nyears, many image semantic segmentation methods have been proposed. These\nmethods mainly focus on the image from camera, due to the limitation of the\nsensor itself, the accurate three-dimensional spatial position of the lane\nmarking cannot be obtained, so the demand for the lane level high-precision map\nconstruction cannot be met. This paper proposes a lane marking semantic\nsegmentation method based on LIDAR and camera fusion deep neural network.\nDifferent from other methods, in order to obtain accurate position information\nof the segmentation results, the semantic segmentation object of this paper is\na bird's eye view converted from a LIDAR points cloud instead of an image\ncaptured by a camera. This method first uses the deeplabv3+ [\\ref{ref:1}]\nnetwork to segment the image captured by the camera, and the segmentation\nresult is merged with the point clouds collected by the LIDAR as the input of\nthe proposed network. In this neural network, we also add a long short-term\nmemory (LSTM) structure to assist the network for semantic segmentation of lane\nmarkings by using the the time series information. The experiments on more than\n14,000 image datasets which we have manually labeled and expanded have shown\nthe proposed method has better performance on the semantic segmentation of the\npoints cloud bird's eye view. Therefore, the automation of high-precision map\nconstruction can be significantly improved.

For example, a polymer dissolved in a poor solvent collapses, whereas\nin a good solvent it opens up. While this standard understanding is generally\nvalid, there are examples when a polymer collapses even in a mixture of two\ngood solvents. This phenomenon, commonly known as co-non-solvency, is usually\nassociated with smart polymers. Moreover, recent experiments have shown that\nthe elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs) show co-non-solvency behavior in\naqueous-ethanol mixtures. In this study, we investigate the phase behavior of\nELPs in aqueous binary mixtures using molecular dynamics simulations of\nall-atom and complementary explicit solvent generic models. The model is\nparameterized by mapping the solvation free energy obtained from the all-atom\nsimulations onto the generic interaction parameters. For this purpose, we\nderive segment based generic parameters for four different peptides, namely\nproline (P), valine (V), glycine (G) and alanine (A). Here we compare the\nconformational behavior of two ELP sequences, namely VPGGG and VPGVG, in\naqueous-ethanol and -urea mixtures. Consistent with recent experiments, we find\nthat ELPs show co-non-solvency in aqueous-ethanol mixtures. Ethanol molecules\nhave preferential binding with all ELP residues and thus driving the\ncoil-to-globule transition. On the contrary, ELP conformations show weak\nvariation in aqueous-urea mixtures. Our simulations suggest that the glycine\nresidues dictate the overall behavior of ELPs in aqueous-urea, where urea\nmolecules have a rather weak preferential binding with glycine, i.e., less than\nkT. While the validation of the latter findings will require more detailed\nexperimental investigation, the results presented here may provide a new twist\nto the present understanding of cosolvent interactions with peptides and\nproteins.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Mar 2020 22:24:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

Such an approach can solve the data association\nproblem more efficiently than graph-based methods and can handle better the\ncombinatorial explosion occurring when multiple frames are analyzed. Because\nour focus is on the data association problem, our MOT method only uses simple\nimage features, which are the center position and color of detections for each\nframe. Constraints are defined on these two features and on the general MOT\nproblem. For example, we enforce color appearance preservation over\ntrajectories and constrain the extent of motion between frames. Filtering\nlayers are used in order to eliminate detection candidates before using CP and\nto remove dummy trajectories produced by the CP solver.

In\nthis paper, we propose an approach which uses projection completion to generate\na prior image, which is then incorporated into an iterative reconstruction\nalgorithm based on the superiorization framework. The prior image is\nreconstructed using normalized metal artifact reduction (NMAR), a popular\nprojection completion approach. The iterative algorithm is a modified version\nof the simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique (SART), which reduces\nartifacts by incorporating a polyenergetic forward model, least-squares\nweighting, and superiorization. The penalty function used for superiorization\nis a weighted average between a total variation (TV) term and a term promoting\nsimilarity with the prior image, similar to penalty functions used in prior\nimage constrained compressive sensing.

The successful technology\nadoption of Crowd-MECS relies on a comprehensive understanding of the\ncomplicated economic interactions and strategic decision-making of different\nstakeholders. In this paper, we focus on studying the economic and strategic\ninteractions between one content provider (CP) and a large crowd of EDs, where\nthe EDs can decide whether to cache and share contents for the CP, and the CP\ncan decide to share a certain revenue with EDs as the incentive of caching and\nsharing contents. We formulate such an interaction as a two-stage Stackelberg\ngame. In Stage I, the CP aims to maximize its own profit by deciding the ratio\nof revenue shared with EDs. In Stage II, EDs aim to maximize their own payoffs\nby choosing to be agents who cache and share contents, and meanwhile gain a\ncertain revenue from the CP, or requesters who do not cache but request\ncontents in the on-demand fashion. We first analyze the EDs' best responses and\nprove the existence and uniqueness of the equilibrium in Stage II by using the\nnon-atomic game theory.

The interstellar dust, unresolved stellar background, nearby star\nblending were modelled. A signal-to-noise limit considering a finite source\neffect determined the event detectability. The Euclid-WFIRST combination\nyielded 30.7 Jupiter-mass FFPs during two 30-day-periods per year in parallax\nobservation. The parallax event rate decreases to 3.9 FFPs for Earth-mass\nplanets. The mass estimation from the parallax light curve allowed recovery of\nFFP masses to within a factor of two for 20-26% of cases. The Euclid-LSST\ncombination yielded 34.5 Jupiter-mass FFPs down to 0.5 Earth-mass FFPs for the\nsame periods and the mass is recovered to within a factor of two in 20-40% of\ncases.

A critical shortcoming\nof HE is the high computation complexity of ciphertext arithmetic; especially,\nHE multiplication (HE Mul) is more than 10,000 times slower than the\ncorresponding multiplication between unencrypted messages.

The\nescaping phase from local optimum is modeled as a Markov decision process with\na fixed escaping policy. We further propose to learn an optimal escaping policy\nby reinforcement learning. The effectiveness of the escaping policies is\nverified by optimizing synthesized functions and training a deep neural network\nfor CIFAR image classification.

This type of data arises commonly in\npractice, e.g, a point cloud $X$ in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ where each point $x\\in X$\nhas a density function value $f_X(x)$ associated to it. An augmented metric\nspace $(X, d_X, f_X)$ naturally gives rise to a 2-parameter filtration\n$\\mathcal{K}$. However, the resulting 2-parameter persistent homology\n$\\mathrm{H}_{\\bullet}(\\mathcal{K})$ could still be of wild representation type,\nand may not have simple indecomposables. In this paper, motivated by the\nelder-rule for the zeroth homology of 1-parameter filtration, we propose a\nbarcode-like summary, called the elder-rule-staircode, as a way to encode\n$\\mathrm{H}_0(\\mathcal{K})$. Specifically, if $n = |X|$, the\nelder-rule-staircode consists of $n$ number of staircase-like blocks in the\nplane. We show that if $\\mathrm{H}_0(\\mathcal{K})$ is interval decomposable,\nthen the barcode of $\\mathrm{H}_0(\\mathcal{K})$ is equal to the\nelder-rule-staircode. Furthermore, regardless of the interval decomposability,\nthe fibered barcode, the dimension function (a.k.a. the Hilbert function), and\nthe graded Betti numbers of $\\mathrm{H}_0(\\mathcal{K})$ can all be efficiently\ncomputed once the elder-rule-staircode is given. Finally, we develop and\nimplement an efficient algorithm to compute the elder-rule-staircode in\n$O(n^2\\log n)$ time, which can be improved to $O(n^2\\alpha(n))$ if $X$ is from\na fixed dimensional Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^d$, where $\\alpha(n)$ is the\ninverse Ackermann function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Mar 2020 03:48:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 12 Jul 2020 21:01:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-17"}

In\nthis paper, we consider the framework of partitioned edge learning for\niteratively training a large-scale model using many resource-constrained\ndevices (called workers).

To reduce resource\nusage by minimizing the total learning-and-communication latency, this work\nfocuses on the novel joint design of parameter (computation load) allocation\nand bandwidth allocation (for downloading and uploading). Two design approaches\nare adopted. First, a practical sequential approach, called partially\nintegrated parameter-and-bandwidth allocation (PABA), yields two schemes,\nnamely bandwidth aware parameter allocation and parameter aware bandwidth\nallocation. The former minimizes the load for the slowest (in computing) of\nworker groups, each training a same parametric block. The latter allocates the\nlargest bandwidth to the worker being the latency bottleneck. Second, PABA are\njointly optimized.

However, simply acquiring data as much as possible is not\nnecessarily an effective strategy for optimizing accuracy and fairness. For\nexample, if an online app store has enough training data for certain slices of\ndata (say American customers), but not for others, obtaining more American\ncustomer data will only bias the model training. Instead, we contend that one\nneeds to selectively acquire data and propose Slice Tuner, which acquires\npossibly-different amounts of data per slice such that the model accuracy and\nfairness on all slices are optimized. This problem is different than labeling\nexisting data (as in active learning or weak supervision) because the goal is\nobtaining the right amounts of new data. At its core, Slice Tuner maintains\nlearning curves of slices that estimate the model accuracies given more data\nand uses convex optimization to find the best data acquisition strategy. The\nkey challenges of estimating learning curves are that they may be inaccurate if\nthere is not enough data, and there may be dependencies among slices where\nacquiring data for one slice influences the learning curves of others. We solve\nthese issues by iteratively and efficiently updating the learning curves as\nmore data is acquired.

The GPCA module intends to model the correlations among\nthe channels, which are assumed to be captured by beta distributed variables.\nAs the beta distribution cannot be integrated into the end-to-end training of\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) with a mathematically tractable solution,\nwe utilize an approximation of the beta distribution to solve this problem.

The Gaussian\nprocess is then utilized to model the correlations among different channels. In\nthis case, a mathematically tractable solution is derived. The GPCA module can\nbe efficiently implemented and integrated into the end-to-end training of the\nCNNs. Experimental results demonstrate the promising performance of the\nproposed GPCA module.

Although advances in solving such equations have been\nmade, it is still the most expensive step of this reduction method. Parametric\nmodel order reduction aims to determine reduced-order models for\nparameter-dependent systems. Popular techniques for parametric model order\nreduction rely on interpolation. Nevertheless, the interpolation of Gramians is\nrarely mentioned, most probably due to the fact that Gramians are symmetric\npositive semidefinite matrices, a property that should be preserved by the\ninterpolation method. In this contribution, we propose and compare two\napproaches for Gramian interpolation. In the first approach, the interpolated\nGramian is computed as a linear combination of the data Gramians with positive\ncoefficients. Even though positive semidefiniteness is guaranteed in this\nmethod, the rank of the interpolated Gramian can be significantly larger than\nthat of the data Gramians.

This goes beyond prior\nmodels, which are either specific to one style and shape, or generalize to\ndifferent shapes producing smooth results, despite being style specific. Our\nhypothesis is that (even non-linear) combinations of examples smooth out high\nfrequency components such as fine-wrinkles, which makes learning the three\nfactors jointly hard. At the heart of our technique is a decomposition of\ndeformation into a high frequency and a low frequency component. While the\nlow-frequency component is predicted from pose, shape and style parameters with\nan MLP, the high-frequency component is predicted with a mixture of shape-style\nspecific pose models. The weights of the mixture are computed with a narrow\nbandwidth kernel to guarantee that only predictions with similar high-frequency\npatterns are combined. The style variation is obtained by computing, in a\ncanonical pose, a subspace of deformation, which satisfies physical constraints\nsuch as inter-penetration, and draping on the body. TailorNet delivers 3D\ngarments which retain the wrinkles from the physics based simulations (PBS) it\nis learned from, while running more than 1000 times faster. In contrast to PBS,\nTailorNet is easy to use and fully differentiable, which is crucial for\ncomputer vision algorithms. Several experiments demonstrate TailorNet produces\nmore realistic results than prior work, and even generates temporally coherent\ndeformations on sequences of the AMASS dataset, despite being trained on static\nposes from a different dataset.

A\ncable-driven continuum robot is one of the most commonly used type. Typical\ncable driven continuum robots consist of a flexible backbone with spacer disks\nattached to the backbone and cables passing through the holes in the spacer\ndisks from the fixed base to a free end. In most such robots, the routing of\nthe cables are straight or a smooth helical curve. In this paper, we analyze\nthe experimental and theoretical deformations of a 3D printed continuum robot,\nfor 6 different kinds of cable routings. The results are compared for discrete\noptimization based kinematic modelling as well as static modelling using\nCosserat rod theory. It is shown that the experimental results match the\ntheoretical results with an error margin of 2%. It is also shown that the\noptimization based approach is faster than the one based on Cosserat rod\ntheory.

In a\nrelativistic context, this naturally leads to the formulation of the theory of\nIsrael and Stewart (1979), which is, to date, one of the most successful\ntheories for relativistic dissipation. Although the generality of the principle\nmakes it applicable to any dissipative fluid, a connection of the\nIsrael-Stewart theory with microphysics has been established, through kinetic\ntheory, only for the case of ideal quantum gases. By performing a convenient\nchange of variables, we provide, for the case of bulk viscosity, an equivalent\nreformulation of the equations at the basis of extended irreversible\nthermodynamics. This approach maps any thermodynamic process which contributes\nto the bulk viscosity into a set of chemical reactions, whose reaction\ncoordinates are abstract parameters describing the displacement from local\nthermodynamic equilibrium of the fluid element. We apply our new formalism to\nthe case of the relativistic fluids, showing that the Israel-Stewart model for\nbulk viscosity is just the second-order expansion of a minimal model belonging\nto a larger class of non-perturbative theories for bulk viscosity which include\nthe nuclear-reaction-mediated bulk viscosity of neutron star matter as a\nparticular case. Furthermore, we show with concrete examples that our formalism\nprovides new ways of computing the bulk viscosity directly and defines a simple\nprescription for constructing the Israel-Stewart model for a generic\nbulk-viscous fluid.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Mar 2020 09:49:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Sep 2020 13:36:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 22 Apr 2021 13:38:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-23"}

We show that this model\ncan be used to well interpret all of the observed data of FRB 180916.J0158+65.\nFurthermore, we constrain the EAB's physical properties and find that (1) the\nouter radius of the EAB is at least an order of magnitude smaller than that of\nits analogue in the solar system, (2) the differential size distribution of the\nEAB's asteroids at small diameters (large diameters) is shallower (steeper)\nthan that of solar-system small objects, and (3) the two belts have a\ncomparable mass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Mar 2020 11:36:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Mar 2020 08:20:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 16 Mar 2020 08:57:02 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 1 May 2020 08:24:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-27"}

Unfortunately, common viewpoint qualities suffer from two major\ndrawbacks: dependency on clean surface meshes, which are not always available,\nand the lack of closed-form expressions, which requires a costly search\ninvolving rendering. To overcome these limitations we propose to separate\nviewpoint selection from rendering through an end-to-end learning approach,\nwhereby we reduce the influence of the mesh quality by predicting viewpoints\nfrom unstructured point clouds instead of polygonal meshes. While this makes\nour approach insensitive to the mesh discretization during evaluation, it only\nbecomes possible when resolving label ambiguities that arise in this context.\nTherefore, we additionally propose to incorporate the label generation into the\ntraining procedure, making the label decision adaptive to the current network\npredictions. We show how our proposed approach allows for learning viewpoint\npredictions for models from different object categories and for different\nviewpoint qualities. Additionally, we show that prediction times are reduced\nfrom several minutes to a fraction of a second, as compared to state-of-the-art\n(SOTA) viewpoint quality evaluation.

The fluorine slope shows a clear\nsecondary behavior in this metallicity range. We also find that the [F/Ce]\nratio is relatively flat for -0.6<[Fe/H]<0, and that for two metal-poor\n([Fe/H]<-0.8), s-process element enhanced giants, we do not detect an elevated\nfluorine abundance.

Thus, by\nestablishing a well-defined framework for successive measurements, we also\nprovide a class of physically allowed operations. Conversely, impossible\nmeasurements can only be performed using impossible (non-local) apparatus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Mar 2020 12:25:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Mar 2020 15:38:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 10:12:55 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 26 Apr 2021 11:57:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-27"}

A need exists to generate a meaningful\nsequential logic of the ANN for interpreting a production process of a specific\noutput. On the other hand, decision trees exhibit better interpretability and\nexpressive power due to their representation language and the existence of\nefficient algorithms to transform the trees into rules. However, growing a\ndecision tree based on the available data could produce larger than necessary\ntrees or trees that do not generalise well. In this paper, we introduce two\nnovel multivariate decision tree (MDT) algorithms for rule extraction from\nANNs: an Exact-Convertible Decision Tree (EC-DT) and an Extended C-Net\nalgorithm. They both transform a neural network with Rectified Linear Unit\nactivation functions into a representative tree, which can further be used to\nextract multivariate rules for reasoning.

Consequently, the problem of detecting semantic lines in the spatial\ndomain is transformed into spotting individual points in the parametric domain,\nmaking the post-processing steps, i.e. non-maximal suppression, more efficient.\nFurthermore, our method makes it easy to extract contextual line features eg\nfeatures along lines close to a specific line, that are critical for accurate\nline detection.

Another challenge is to jointly model the candidate sticker with the\nmulti-turn dialog context. To tackle these challenges, we propose a sticker\nresponse selector (SRS) model. Specifically, SRS first employs a convolutional\nbased sticker image encoder and a self-attention based multi-turn dialog\nencoder to obtain the representation of stickers and utterances. Next, deep\ninteraction network is proposed to conduct deep matching between the sticker\nwith each utterance in the dialog history. SRS then learns the short-term and\nlong-term dependency between all interaction results by a fusion network to\noutput the the final matching score. To evaluate our proposed method, we\ncollect a large-scale real-world dialog dataset with stickers from one of the\nmost popular online chatting platform. Extensive experiments conducted on this\ndataset show that our model achieves the state-of-the-art performance for all\ncommonly-used metrics. Experiments also verify the effectiveness of each\ncomponent of SRS. To facilitate further research in sticker selection field, we\nrelease this dataset of 340K multi-turn dialog and sticker pairs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Mar 2020 13:10:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-11"}

By exploiting internal self-similar\npatches (i.e., patch-recurrence), the baseline network can be adapted to the\ngiven specific input image.

Similar to\nthe classical notion of randomized response, the idea is that data owners\nrandomize their true information locally and only release the perturbed data.\nMany different protocols for such local perturbation procedures can be\ndesigned. In most estimation problems studied in the literature so far,\nhowever, no significant difference in terms of minimax risk between purely\nnon-interactive protocols and protocols that allow for some amount of\ninteraction between individual data providers could be observed. In this paper\nwe show that for estimating the integrated square of a density, sequentially\ninteractive procedures improve substantially over the best possible\nnon-interactive procedure in terms of minimax rate of estimation. In\nparticular, in the non-interactive scenario we identify an elbow in the minimax\nrate at $s=\\frac34$, whereas in the sequentially interactive scenario the elbow\nis at $s=\\frac12$. This is markedly different from both, the case of direct\nobservations, where the elbow is well known to be at $s=\\frac14$, as well as\nfrom the case where Laplace noise is added to the original data, where an elbow\nat $s= \\frac94$ is obtained. We also provide adaptive estimators that achieve\nthe optimal rate up to log-factors, we draw connections to non-parametric\ngoodness-of-fit testing and estimation of more general integral functionals and\nconduct a series of numerical experiments.

A global low-rank structure identifies a small set of latent\nprincipal functional responses and predictors that drives the underlying\nregression association. A local low-rank structure then controls the complexity\nand smoothness of the association between the principal functional responses\nand predictors.

In such\nproblems, when there are many candidate predictors, it is not only of interest\nto identify the predictors that are associated with the outcome, but also to\ndistinguish the true sources of heterogeneity, i.e., to identify the predictors\nthat have different effects among the clusters and thus are the true\ncontributors to the formation of the clusters. We clarify the concepts of the\nsource of heterogeneity that account for potential scale differences of the\nclusters and propose a regularized finite mixture effects regression to achieve\nheterogeneity pursuit and feature selection simultaneously. As the name\nsuggests, the problem is formulated under an effects-model parameterization, in\nwhich the cluster labels are missing and the effect of each predictor on the\noutcome is decomposed to a common effect term and a set of cluster-specific\nterms. A constrained sparse estimation of these effects leads to the\nidentification of both the variables with common effects and those with\nheterogeneous effects.

The mean densities of\nstreamers is almost identical between solar minimum and maximum. However,\nstreamers at solar maximum contain around 50\\%\\ more total mass due to their\nlarger area.

The memory\nconsistency model (MCM) of processors in such SoCs specifies the ordering rules\nwhich constrain the values that can be read by load instructions in parallel\nprograms running on such systems. The implementation of required MCM orderings\ncan span components which may be designed and implemented by many different\nteams. Ideally, each team would be able to specify the orderings enforced by\ntheir components independently and then connect them together when conducting\nMCM verification. However, no prior automated approach for formal hardware MCM\nverification provided this.\n  To bring automated hardware MCM verification in line with the realities of\nthe design process, we present RealityCheck, a methodology and tool for\nautomated formal MCM verification of modular microarchitectural ordering\nspecifications. RealityCheck allows users to specify their designs as a\nhierarchy of distinct modules connected to each other rather than a single flat\nspecification. It can then automatically verify litmus test programs against\nthese modular specifications. RealityCheck also provides support for\nabstraction, which enables scalable verification by breaking up the\nverification of the entire design into smaller verification problems. We\npresent results for verifying litmus tests on 7 different designs using\nRealityCheck. These include in-order and out-of-order pipelines, a non-blocking\ncache, and a heterogeneous processor. Our case studies cover the TSO and RISC-V\n(RVWMO) weak memory models. RealityCheck is capable of verifying 98 RVWMO\nlitmus tests in under 4 minutes each, and its capability for abstraction\nenables up to a 32.1% reduction in litmus test verification time for RVWMO.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Mar 2020 22:48:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-17"}

The HEMlets utilize three joint-heatmaps to represent the\nrelative depth information of the end-joints for each skeletal body part. In\nour approach, a Convolutional Network (ConvNet) is first trained to predict\nHEMlets from the input image, followed by a volumetric joint-heatmap\nregression.

Our study on the\nexplanation for the stability of mining gap game for Blockchain ecosystems\nshows that the concept of consensus equilibria may play a important role for\nthe development of fundamental theory for consensus economics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Mar 2020 13:31:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2020 20:28:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

They were called\nswitchbacks as some of them show up the full reversal of the radial component\nof the magnetic field and then return to regular conditions. Analyzing the\nmagnetic field and plasma perturbations associated with switchbacks we identify\nthree types of structures with slightly different characteristics: 1. Alfvenic\nstructures, where the variations of the magnetic field components take place\nwhile the magnitude of the field remains constant; 2. Compressional, the field\nmagnitude varies together with changes of the components; 3. Structures\nmanifesting full reversal of the magnetic field (extremal class of Alfvenic\nstructures). Processing of structures boundaries and plasma bulk velocity\nperturbations lead to the conclusion that they represent localized magnetic\nfield tubes with enhanced parallel plasma velocity and ion beta moving together\nwith respect to surrounding plasma. The magnetic field deflections before and\nafter the switchbacks reveal the existence of total axial current. The electric\ncurrents are concentrated on the relatively narrow boundary layers on the\nsurface of the tubes and determine the magnetic field perturbations inside the\ntube. These currents are closed on the structure surface, and typically have\ncomparable azimuthal and the axial components. The surface of the structure may\nalso accommodate an electromagnetic wave, that assists to particles in carrying\ncurrents. We suggest that the two types of structures we analyzed here may\nrepresent the local manifestations of the tube deformations corresponding to a\nsaturated stage of the Firehose instability development.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Mar 2020 16:03:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-29"}

This may result in amplified drag loads and fast accumulation of\nfatigue damage. Consequently, accurate prediction of VIV responses is of great\nimportance for the safe design and operation of marine risers. Model tests with\nelastic pipes have shown that VIV responses are influenced by many structural\nand hydrodynamic parameters, which have not been fully modelled in present\nfrequency domain VIV prediction tools. Traditionally, predictions have been\ncomputed using a single set of hydrodynamic parameters, often leading to\ninconsistent prediction accuracy when compared with observed field measurements\nand experimental data. Hence, it is necessary to implement a high safety factor\nof 10 - 20 in the riser design, which increases development cost and adds extra\nconstraints in the field operation. One way to compensate for the\nsimplifications in the mathematical prediction model is to apply adaptive\nparameters to describe different riser responses. The objective of this work is\nto demonstrate a new method to improve the prediction consistency and accuracy\nby applying adaptive hydrodynamic parameters. In the present work, a four-step\napproach has been proposed: First, the measured VIV response will be analysed\nto identify key parameters to represent the response characteristics. These\nparameters will be grouped using data clustering algorithms. Secondly, optimal\nhydrodynamic parameters will be identified for each data group by optimisation\nagainst measured data. Thirdly, the VIV response using the obtained parameters\nwill be calculated and the prediction accuracy evaluated. The correct\nhydrodynamic parameters to be used for new cases can be obtained from the\nclustering. This concept has been demonstrated with examples from experimental\ndata.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Mar 2020 08:20:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-13"}

Humans, when not distracted or drunk, are still the best\ndrivers you can currently find. For this reason we take inspiration from two\ntheoretical ideas about the human mind and its neural organization. The first\nidea concerns how the brain uses a hierarchical structure of neuron ensembles\nto extract abstract concepts from visual experience and code them into compact\nrepresentations. The second idea suggests that these neural perceptual\nrepresentations are not neutral but functional to the prediction of the future\nstate of affairs in the environment. Similarly, the prediction mechanism is not\nneutral but oriented to the current planning of a future action. We identify\nwithin the deep learning framework two artificial counterparts of the\naforementioned neurocognitive theories. We find a correspondence between the\nfirst theoretical idea and the architecture of convolutional autoencoders,\nwhile we translate the second theory into a training procedure that learns\ncompact representations which are not neutral but oriented to driving tasks,\nfrom two distinct perspectives. From a static perspective, we force groups of\nneural units in the compact representations to distinctly represent specific\nconcepts crucial to the driving task. From a dynamic perspective, we encourage\nthe compact representations to be predictive of how the current road scenario\nwill change in the future. We successfully learn compact representations that\nuse as few as 16 neural units for each of the two basic driving concepts we\nconsider: car and lane. We prove the efficiency of our proposed perceptual\nrepresentations on the SYNTHIA dataset.

However, use in systems\nsuch as FPGAs and GPUs requires understanding hardware-specific technical\nspecifications such as HDL and CUDA, which is a high hurdle. Based on this\nbackground, I previously proposed environment adaptive software that enables\nautomatic conversion, configuration, and high-performance operation of once\nwritten code according to the hardware to be placed. As an element of the\nconcept, I proposed a method to automatically offload loop statements of\napplication source code for CPU to FPGA and GPU. In this paper, I propose and\nevaluate a method for offloading a function block, which is a larger unit,\ninstead of individual loop statements in an application, to achieve higher\nspeed by automatic offloading to GPU and FPGA. I implement the proposed method\nand evaluate with existing applications offloading to GPU.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Mar 2020 20:49:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-11"}
