Besides the general\nneed for simplification of the window setting method for the purpose of\ndiagnosis, there are specific clinical needs for the resection of malignant\nlesions in the mandible, for example, where the lesions may exist in both the\nsoft tissue and the bone. A successful medical algorithm has to take into\naccount the requirement to variously expose the same range of specific gray\nlevels, when they are presented by different body tissues. As a solution, we\npropose an adaptive multi-scale contrast companding (AMCC) algorithm that is\nimplemented by using soft threshold separation to two channels (bone and soft\ntissue). This separation is determined by the HU intensity values (that are\nalready computed in the algorithm) in the specific resolution that is best\nfitted to the teeth. Each channel contains different set of parameters. The\nAMCC algorithm successfully and adaptively compands a large variety of\nmandibular CT HDR images as well as natural images.

An ESC ensures that\nthe submatrix of the matrix variable corresponding to the subgraph is in the\ncorrect polytope. By including only some ESCs into the SDP the ESH can be\nexploited computationally.\n  In this paper we introduce a variant of the ESH that computes $\\vartheta(G)$\nthrough an SDP with a matrix variable of order $n$ and $m+1$ constraints.

The hydrides decorate near basal planes in\norientation, and for micropillars orientated for <a> basal slip localised shear\nat the hydride-matrix interface is favoured over slip in {\\alpha}-Zr matrix due\nto a lower shear stress required.

In this\npaper, we propose to learn data representations with a novel type of denoising\nautoencoder, where the noisy input data is generated by corrupting latent clean\ndata in the gradient domain. This can be naturally generalized to span multiple\nscales with a Laplacian pyramid representation of the input data. In this way,\nthe agent learns more robust representations that exploit the underlying data\nstructures across multiple scales.

Using the results of their model and taking into account\ngalactic number distributions and supernova rates I argue here that this result\nconstitutes a violation of the Principle of Mediocrity as applied to the\nreference class of all extant technological species. Assuming that we are a\ntypical technological species in the attribute of inhabiting a relatively large\ndisk-dominated galaxy, I outline two hypotheses that could significantly limit\nthe habitability of large elliptical galaxies: (1) massive galactic\nsterilization events associated with quasar/AGN activity and starburst\nsupernovae that occurred when the antecedents of today's large elliptical\ngalaxies were much more compact; and (2) the probability of habitable planet\nformation in large elliptical galaxies may be small since a disproportionately\nlarger number of gaseous planets are expected to form as a result of the\ngenerally higher metallicity in large elliptical galaxies. Consequently, fewer\nhabitable planets will accrete if the gaseous planets inward migrations are\nsufficiently slow. The sterilization events of Hypothesis (1) occurred at\nearlier epochs (z $\\geq$ 1) and so they must be effectively permanent, implying\ntwo possible scenarios regarding the origin and evolution of life. In\nconnection with one of these scenarios, independent applications of the\nPrinciple of Mediocrity suggest that M-dwarf stars are not significant hosts of\ntechnological life.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Mar 2020 17:21:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

The bottleneck lies in the reconstruction algorithms; they are\neither too slow (iterative optimization algorithms) or not flexible to the\nencoding process (deep learning based end-to-end networks). In this paper, we\ndevelop fast and flexible algorithms for SCI based on the plug-and-play (PnP)\nframework.

While existing methods like deep image prior (DIP) capture\nlow-level image statistics, there are still gaps toward an image prior that\ncaptures rich image semantics including color, spatial coherence, textures, and\nhigh-level concepts. This work presents an effective way to exploit the image\nprior captured by a generative adversarial network (GAN) trained on large-scale\nnatural images. As shown in Fig.1, the deep generative prior (DGP) provides\ncompelling results to restore missing semantics, e.g., color, patch,\nresolution, of various degraded images. It also enables diverse image\nmanipulation including random jittering, image morphing, and category transfer.\nSuch highly flexible restoration and manipulation are made possible through\nrelaxing the assumption of existing GAN-inversion methods, which tend to fix\nthe generator. Notably, we allow the generator to be fine-tuned on-the-fly in a\nprogressive manner regularized by feature distance obtained by the\ndiscriminator in GAN. We show that these easy-to-implement and practical\nchanges help preserve the reconstruction to remain in the manifold of nature\nimage, and thus lead to more precise and faithful reconstruction for real\nimages.

In semantic PIR, a user retrieves a message out of $K$\nindependent messages stored in $N$ replicated and non-colluding databases\nwithout revealing the identity of the desired message to any individual\ndatabase. The messages come with \\emph{different semantics}, i.e., the messages\nare allowed to have \\emph{non-uniform a priori probabilities} denoted by\n$(p_i>0,\\: i \\in [K])$, which are a proxy for their respective popularity of\nretrieval, and \\emph{arbitrary message sizes} $(L_i,\\: i \\in [K])$. This is a\ngeneralization of the classical private information retrieval (PIR) problem,\nwhere messages are assumed to have equal a priori probabilities and equal\nmessage sizes. We derive the semantic PIR capacity for general $K$, $N$. The\nresults show that the semantic PIR capacity depends on the number of databases\n$N$, the number of messages $K$, the a priori probability distribution of\nmessages $p_i$, and the message sizes $L_i$.

With the\nadvent of AutoML and neural architecture search (NAS), pruning has become\ntopical with automatic mechanism and searching based architecture optimization.\nYet, current automatic designs rely on either reinforcement learning or\nevolutionary algorithm. Due to the non-differentiability of those algorithms,\nthe pruning algorithm needs a long searching stage before reaching the\nconvergence.\n  To circumvent this problem, this paper introduces a differentiable pruning\nmethod via hypernetworks for automatic network pruning. The specifically\ndesigned hypernetworks take latent vectors as input and generate the weight\nparameters of the backbone network. The latent vectors control the output\nchannels of the convolutional layers in the backbone network and act as a\nhandle for the pruning of the layers. By enforcing $\\ell_1$ sparsity\nregularization to the latent vectors and utilizing proximal gradient solver,\nsparse latent vectors can be obtained. Passing the sparsified latent vectors\nthrough the hypernetworks, the corresponding slices of the generated weight\nparameters can be removed, achieving the effect of network pruning. The latent\nvectors of all the layers are pruned together, resulting in an automatic layer\nconfiguration. Extensive experiments are conducted on various networks for\nimage classification, single image super-resolution, and denoising.

Famous examples include the Monster\nsymmetry group of a $c=24$ two-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT)\nconstructed by Frenkel, Lepowsky and Meurman, and the Conway symmetry group of\na $c=12$ CFT explored in detail by Duncan and Mack-Crane. The Mathieu moonshine\nconnection between the K3 elliptic genus and the Mathieu group $M_{24}$ has led\nto the study of K3 sigma models with large symmetry groups. A particular K3 CFT\nwith a maximal symmetry group preserving $(4,4)$ superconformal symmetry was\nstudied in beautiful work by Gaberdiel, Taormina, Volpato, and Wendland. The\npresent paper shows that in both the GTVW and $c=12$ theories the construction\nof superconformal generators can be understood via the theory of quantum error\ncorrecting codes. The automorphism groups of these codes lift to symmetry\ngroups in the CFT preserving the superconformal generators. In the case of the\n$N=1$ supercurrent of the GTVW model our result, combined with a result of T.\nJohnson-Freyd implies the symmetry group is the maximal subgroup of $M_{24}$\nknown as the sextet group. (The sextet group is also known as the holomorph of\nthe hexacode.) Building on \\cite{gtvw} the Ramond-Ramond sector of the GTVW\nmodel is related to the Miracle Octad Generator which in turn leads to a role\nfor the Golay code as a group of symmetries of RR states. Moreover, $(4,1)$\nsuperconformal symmetry suffices to define and decompose the elliptic genus of\na K3 sigma model into characters of the $N=4$ superconformal algebra. The\nsymmetry group preserving $(4,1)$ is larger than that preserving $(4,4)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Mar 2020 18:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-24"}

These Chern insulator states arise due to many\nbody effects in the Chern bands of these systems when they are partially filled\nto a total integer filling $\\nu_T = 1,3$ (including spin and valley degrees of\nfreedom). A simple possible explanation is from Hartree-Fock mean field theory\nwhich predicts valley and spin polarization in the zero bandwidth limit,\nsimilar to the \"quantum Hall ferromagnetism\" in Landau levels.

This has been interpreted as a metallicity bimodality, created by\na two-stage galaxy formation where the red, metal-rich GCs were formed in the\nparent halo and the blue metal-poor GCs were accreted. This interpretation,\nhowever, crucially depends on the assumption that GCs are exclusively old\nstellar systems with a linear colour-metallicity relation (CZR). The shape of\nthe CZR and range of GC ages are currently under debate, because their study\nrequires high quality spectra to derive reliable stellar population properties.\nWe determined metallicities with full spectral fitting from a sample of 187 GCs\nwith high spectral signal-to-noise ratio in 23 galaxies of the Fornax cluster\nthat were observed as part of the Fornax 3D project.

The less massive galaxies in our\nsample ($M_\\ast < 10^{10} M_\\odot$) appear to have slightly younger GCs, but\nthe shape of the CZR is insensitive to the GC ages. Although the least massive\ngalaxies lack red, metal-rich GCs, a non-linear CZR is found irrespective of\nthe galaxy mass, even in the most massive galaxies ($M_\\ast \\geq 10^{11}\nM_\\odot$). Our CZR predicts narrow unimodal GC metallicity distributions for\nlow mass and broad unimodal distributions for very massive galaxies, dominated\nby a metal-poor and metal-rich peak, respectively, and bimodal distributions\nfor galaxies with intermediate masses (10$^{10}$ $\\leq$ $M_\\ast < 10^{11}\nM_\\odot$) as a consequence of the relative fraction of red and blue GCs.

We derive the Mukhanov-Sasaki (MS) equation for the Brown-Kuchar (BK)\nand Gaussian dust models, which both consider four dust fields as reference\nfields. The reduced phase space of Dirac observables, that is the\ngauge-invariant part of the theory, is constructed by means of an observable\nmap applied to all elementary phase space variables of the coupled system,\nconsisting of gravity, a massive scalar field and the dust degrees of freedom.\nThe evolution of these observables is governed by a so called physical\nHamiltonian which can be derived once the set of reference fields are chosen\nand differs for each model. First, the reduced phase space as well as the\ncorresponding equations of motion are derived for full general relativity. Then\nfrom this, the gauge-invariant version of the equations of motion for the\nbackground are derived which contain a fingerprint of the dust reference\nfields. Afterwards we study linear cosmological perturbations around a FLRW\nmetric using the scalar-vector-tensor decomposition and derive the equation of\nmotion for the MS variable in this formalism for a chosen set of variables on\nthe reduced phase space and expressed in terms of Dirac observables. The MS\nequation involves additional contributions that can be understood as back\nreactions from the dust reference fields. These additional dust contributions\nto the MS equation were absent if the dust energy and momentum density as well\nas their perturbations are vanishing. The nature of the correction terms\nsuggest that BK and Gaussian dust reference fields contribute differently.\nUsing numerical simulations we study the behavior of the dust contributions to\nthe MS equation during inflation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Mar 2020 18:23:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2020 17:01:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-22"}

Similarly, snake robots hold the\npromise as a versatile platform to traverse complex environments like\nearthquake rubble. Unlike snake locomotion on flat surfaces which is inherently\nstable, when snakes traverse complex terrain by deforming their body out of\nplane, it becomes challenging to maintain stability. Here, we review our recent\nprogress in understanding how snakes and snake robots traverse large, smooth\nobstacles that lack anchor points for gripping or bracing. First, we discovered\nthat the generalist variable kingsnake combines lateral oscillation and\ncantilevering. Regardless of step height and surface friction, the overall gait\nis preserved. Next, to quantify static stability of the snake, we developed a\nmethod to interpolate continuous body in three dimensions (both position and\norientation) between discrete tracked markers. By analyzing the base of support\nusing the interpolated continuous body 3-D kinematics, we discovered that the\nsnake maintained perfect stability during traversal, even on the most\nchallenging low friction, high step. Finally, we applied this gait to a snake\nrobot and systematically tested its performance traversing large steps with\nvariable heights to further understand stability principles. The robot rapidly\nand stably traversed steps nearly as high as a third of its body length. As\nstep height increased, the robot rolled more frequently to the extent of\nflipping over, reducing traversal probability. The absence of such failure in\nthe snake with a compliant body inspired us to add body compliance to the\nrobot. With better surface contact, the compliant body robot suffered less roll\ninstability and traversed high steps at higher probability, without sacrificing\ntraversal speed. Our robot traversed large step-like obstacles more rapidly\nthan most previous snake robots, approaching that of the animal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Mar 2020 18:30:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-04"}

First, we quantify the number\nof mistakes made by popular crowd counting approaches. Our results show that\n(i) mistakes on background are substantial and they are responsible for 18-49%\nof the total error, (ii) models do not generalize well to different kinds of\nbackgrounds and perform poorly on completely background images, and (iii)\nmodels make many more mistakes than those captured by the standard Mean\nAbsolute Error (MAE) metric, as counting on background compensates considerably\nfor misses on foreground.

We enrich a typical crowd\ncounting network with a segmentation branch trained to suppress background\npredictions.

A common approach is to\ninclude a Gaussian prior, which is defined by a mean vector and a symmetric and\npositive definite covariance matrix, and to use iterative projection methods to\nsolve the corresponding regularized problem. However, a main challenge for many\nof these iterative methods is that the prior covariance matrix must be known\nand fixed (up to a constant) before starting the solution process. In this\npaper, we develop hybrid projection methods for inverse problems with mixed\nGaussian priors where the prior covariance matrix is a convex combination of\nmatrices and the mixing parameter and the regularization parameter do not need\nto be known in advance. Such scenarios may arise when data is used to generate\na sample prior covariance matrix (e.g., in data assimilation) or when different\npriors are needed to capture different qualities of the solution. The proposed\nhybrid methods are based on a mixed Golub-Kahan process, which is an extension\nof the generalized Golub-Kahan bidiagonalization, and a distinctive feature of\nthe proposed approach is that both the regularization parameter and the\nweighting parameter for the covariance matrix can be estimated automatically\nduring the iterative process. Furthermore, for problems where training data are\navailable, various data-driven covariance matrices (including those based on\nlearned covariance kernels) can be easily incorporated. Numerical examples from\ntomographic reconstruction demonstrate the potential for these methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Mar 2020 19:34:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-01"}

In a parameter-free way we found that the three-pomeron\nmechanism is significant for $D$-meson production in the small-$p_{T}$\nkinematics, although it is less important at large $p_{T}$, as well as for\n$B$-mesons. The inclusion of the three-pomeron mechanism significantly improves\nthe agreement of theoretical predictions with experimental data in the\nsmall-$p_{T}$ kinematics. We also consider the non-prompt charmonia production,\nand demonstrate that the theoretical results are in reasonable agreement with\nexperimental data. Finally, we compare the theoretical predictions for the\ndependence on multiplicity of co-produced hadrons to experimental data recently\nmeasured by the ALICE collaboration. We found that, contrary to naive\nexpectations, the contribution of the three-pomeron mechanism has only a mild\neffect on the self-normalized observables in the range of multiplicities\nstudied at ALICE, and for this reason the two-pomeron fusion mechanism can\ndescribe reasonably well the experimentally observed multiplicity dependence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Mar 2020 19:37:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-27"}

An adiabatic equation of state is\nadopted, with a range of adiabatic indices, which maintains a smooth flow.\nMergers between MBHs in this mass range would be detectable by the upcoming\nLaser Inteferometer Space Antenna (LISA). The orbital evolution is followed\nfrom the CND scale ($100$~pc) down to separations of $0.1$--$0.01$~pc at which\na circumbinary disk (CBD) could form. The decay is erratic and strongly\ndependent on the gas flow within the disk, that ultimately determines the net\ntorques experienced by the sinking MBH. Overall, we can identify three\ndifferent evolutionary stages: (i) an initially slow decay that leads to no\nsignificant change in the orbital angular momentum, resulting in some\ncircularization; (ii) a fast migration phase in which the orbital angular\nmomentum decreases rapidly; and (iii) a final, very slow decay phase, in which\norbital angular momentum can even increase, and a CBD can form. The fast\nmigration phase owes to disk-driven torques originating primarily from the\nco-orbital region of the secondary MBH, at a distance of 1--3 Hill radii. We\nfind strong analogies with fast Type III migration for massive planets in\nprotoplanetary disks. The CBD forms only when the decay rate becomes small\nenough to allow it enough time to carve a cavity around the primary MBH, at\nscales $\\lesssim 1$~pc; when this happens, the MBH separation nearly stalls in\nour higher-resolution run. We suggest an empirically modified gap-opening\ncriterion that takes into account such timescale effects as well as other\ndeviations from standard assumptions made in the literature.

The speed jump amplitude is governed by the fracture energy\ncontrast and by the combination of rate-dependency of fracture energy and\ninertia of the medium, which allows the crack to cross a fracture energy\ndiscontinuity at constant energy release rate.

The current\nstate-of-the-art CFSTP solver, the Coalition Formation with Look-Ahead (CFLA)\nalgorithm, has two main limitations. First, its time complexity is exponential\nwith the number of agents. Second, as we show, its look-ahead technique is not\neffective in real-world scenarios, such as open multi-agent systems, where new\ntasks can appear at any time. In this work, we study its design and define an\nextension, called Coalition Formation with Improved Look-Ahead (CFLA2), which\nachieves better performance. Since we cannot eliminate the limitations of CFLA\nin CFLA2, we also develop a novel algorithm to solve the CFSTP, the first to be\nanytime, efficient and with provable guarantees, called Cluster-based Coalition\nFormation (CCF). We empirically show that, in settings where the look-ahead\ntechnique is highly effective, CCF completes up to 30% (resp. 10%) more tasks\nthan CFLA (resp.

The number of hidden variables $K$ is unknown and both $m$\nand $p$ are allowed but not required to grow with the sample size $n$. Since\nonly $Y$ and $X$ are observable, we provide necessary conditions for the\nidentifiability of $\\Ttheta$. The same set of conditions are shown to be\nsufficient when the error $E$ is homoscedastic. Our identifiability proof is\nconstructive and leads to a novel and computationally efficient estimation\nalgorithm, called HIVE. The first step of the algorithm is to estimate the best\nlinear prediction of $Y$ given $X$ in which the unknown coefficient matrix\nexhibits an additive decomposition of $\\Ttheta$ and a dense matrix originated\nfrom the correlation between $X$ and the hidden variable $Z$. Under the row\nsparsity assumption on $\\Ttheta$, we propose to minimize a penalized least\nsquares loss by regularizing $\\Ttheta$ via a group-lasso penalty and\nregularizing the dense matrix via a multivariate ridge penalty. Non-asymptotic\ndeviation bounds of the in-sample prediction error are established. Our second\nstep is to estimate the row space of $B^*$ by leveraging the covariance\nstructure of the residual vector from the first step. In the last step, we\nremove the effect of hidden variable by projecting $Y$ onto the complement of\nthe estimated row space of $B^*$. Non-asymptotic error bounds of our final\nestimator are established. The model identifiability, parameter estimation and\nstatistical guarantees are further extended to the setting with heteroscedastic\nerrors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Mar 2020 22:17:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 2021 19:17:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-01"}

This resonance occurs when the\nfrequency of the planet's rotation axis precession becomes commensurate with an\norbital eigenfrequency of the planetary system. The planet's eccentricity\nenables a participating orbital frequency through an interaction in which the\napsidal precession of the planet's orbit causes a cyclic nutation of the\nplanet's orbital angular momentum vector. The resulting orbital frequency\nfollows the relationship $f = 2 \\dot{\\varpi} - \\dot{\\Omega}$, where\n$\\dot{\\varpi}$ and $\\dot{\\Omega}$ are the rates of the planet's changing\nlongitude of periapsis and ascending node, respectively.

However,\nfew studies have addressed the problem of understanding equilibrium itself.\nEquilibrium is commonly assessed based on the assumption that its thermodynamic\nstate should be determined solely by temperature and pressure. However, this\nassumption must be reappraised from the beginning through a rigorous definition\nof equilibrium because no rigorous proof for this assumption exists. Previous\nwork showed that for solids, the equilibrium positions of all constituent atoms\nof the solid are state variables (TC). In this study, this conclusion is\nfurther elaborated starting from the principles of solid-state physics. This\ntheory has been applied to glass materials. Results show that first, the glass\nstate is an equilibrium state. Accordingly, the properties of a glass can be\nsolely described by the present positions of the atom, irrespective of their\nprevious history. Second, the glass transition, although a nonequilibrium\nphenomenon, is well described using TCs if the thermal part of the energy is be\nassumed to be well separated from the structural part. The only dynamic\nparameter involved in this approach is the relaxation time, which is uniquely\ndetermined using the present values of the TCs. Therefore, complicated\nfunctions describing the past history are unnecessary. This implies that the\nactivation energy for the structural relaxation strongly depends on TCs. This\nfinding provides a reasonable understanding of the large deviations from the\nArrhenius law. The unrealistic values of the activation energy and of the\npre-exponential factor of the relaxation time can be resolved on this basis.\nThe theory is particularly suitable for experiments that do not involve\nhypothetical quantities and models; therefore, all quantities are measurable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Mar 2020 23:51:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-05"}

We\nconsider two versions of this problem: RMOP offline and RMOP online.

The\nbasic assumption of the former approach that the data collector is trustworthy\ndoes not always hold true in reality, whereas the latter approach reduces the\nvalue of data. In this paper, we investigate the privacy leakage issue from the\nroot source. Specifically, we take a fresh look to reverse the inferior\nposition of the data provider by making her dominate the game with the\ncollector to solve the dilemma in data trading. To that aim, we propose the\nnoisy-sequentially zero-determinant (NSZD) strategies by tailoring the\nclassical zero-determinant strategies, originally designed for the\nsimultaneous-move game, to adapt to the noisy sequential game. NSZD strategies\ncan empower the data provider to unilaterally set the expected payoff of the\ndata collector or enforce a positive relationship between her and the data\ncollector's expected payoffs. Both strategies can stimulate a rational data\ncollector to behave honestly, boosting a healthy data trading market.

Most of the conventional DTA prediction methods are\nsimulation-based, which rely heavily on domain knowledge or the assumption of\nhaving the 3D structure of the targets, which are often difficult to obtain.\nMeanwhile, traditional machine learning-based methods apply various features\nand descriptors, and simply depend on the similarities between drug-target\npairs.

While recent works adopted the\nattention mechanism to learn the contextual relations among elements of the\nface, they have largely overlooked the disastrous impacts of inaccurate\nattention scores; in addition, they fail to pay sufficient attention to key\nfacial components, the completion results of which largely determine the\nauthenticity of a face image.

We validate our method on both\nthe synthetic SUNCG-RGBD dataset and the real NYUv2 dataset and the results\nshow that our method respectively achieves the gains of 2.5% and 2.6% on the\nsynthetic SUNCG-RGBD dataset and the real NYUv2 dataset against the\nstate-of-the-art method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2020 02:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Apr 2020 03:39:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-17"}

The origin of their extended Ly$\\alpha$ emission remains a\nmystery. Some models posit that Ly$\\alpha$ emission is produced when the cloud\nis photoionized by UV emission from embedded or nearby sources, while others\nsuggest that the Ly$\\alpha$ photons originate from an embedded galaxy or AGN\nand are then resonantly scattered by the cloud. At least in the latter\nscenario, the observed Ly$\\alpha$ emission will be polarized. To test these\npossibilities, we are conducting imaging polarimetric observations of seven\nLy$\\alpha$ nebulae. Here we present our results for LABd05, a cloud at $z$ =\n2.656 with an obscured, embedded AGN to the northeast of the peak of Ly$\\alpha$\nemission. We detect significant polarization. The highest polarization\nfractions $P$ are $\\sim$10-20% at $\\sim$20-40 kpc southeast of the Ly$\\alpha$\npeak, away from the AGN. The lowest $P$, including upper-limits, are $\\sim$5%\nand lie between the Ly$\\alpha$ peak and AGN. In other words, the polarization\nmap is lopsided, with $P$ increasing from the Ly$\\alpha$ peak to the southeast.\nThe measured polarization angles $\\theta$ are oriented northeast, roughly\nperpendicular to the $P$ gradient. This unique polarization pattern suggests\nthat 1) the spatially-offset AGN is photoionizing nearby gas and 2) escaping\nLy$\\alpha$ photons are scattered by the nebula at larger radii and into our\nsightline, producing tangentially-oriented, radially-increasing polarization\naway from the photoionized region. Finally we conclude that the interplay\nbetween the gas density and ionization profiles produces the observed central\npeak in the Ly$\\alpha$ emission. This also implies that the structure of LABd05\nis more complex than assumed by current theoretical spherical or cylindrical\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2020 02:13:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-13"}

The main\nchallenge of the problem is the catastrophic forgetting, and for the\nexemplar-memory based CIL methods, it is generally known that the forgetting is\ncommonly caused by the classification score bias that is injected due to the\ndata imbalance between the new classes and the old classes (in the\nexemplar-memory). While several methods have been proposed to correct such\nscore bias by some additional post-processing, e.g., score re-scaling or\nbalanced fine-tuning, no systematic analysis on the root cause of such bias has\nbeen done. To that end, we analyze that computing the softmax probabilities by\ncombining the output scores for all old and new classes could be the main cause\nof the bias. Then, we propose a new method, dubbed as Separated Softmax for\nIncremental Learning (SS-IL), that consists of separated softmax (SS) output\nlayer combined with task-wise knowledge distillation (TKD) to resolve such\nbias.

However, the acquisition of accurate and large\nground truth data sets to model these fully supervised methods is a major\nchallenge for the further development of the area. Self-supervised methods\ntrained with monocular videos constitute one the most promising approaches to\nmitigate the challenge mentioned above due to the wide-spread availability of\ntraining data. Consequently, they have been intensively studied, where the main\nideas explored consist of different types of model architectures, loss\nfunctions, and occlusion masks to address non-rigid motion. In this paper, we\npropose two new ideas to improve self-supervised monocular trained depth\nestimation: 1) self-attention, and 2) discrete disparity prediction. Compared\nwith the usual localised convolution operation, self-attention can explore a\nmore general contextual information that allows the inference of similar\ndisparity values at non-contiguous regions of the image. Discrete disparity\nprediction has been shown by fully supervised methods to provide a more robust\nand sharper depth estimation than the more common continuous disparity\nprediction, besides enabling the estimation of depth uncertainty.

In the field of particles, complete\northogonality is ubiquitous between any two different identical particles, and\nthe complete orthogonality (at the microscopic level) evolves into the partial\nspectral orthogonality between different ESSs at the mesoscopic level. As a\nresult, we developed SVD to TDSVD so as to reveal the relative amounts of\ndifferent ESSs in each time interval, and it is the first time that the single\nsolution can be drew from only the TA data set without any kinds of a priori\ninformation. In the previous articles, the mathematical underdetermination\nproblem has been addressed prominently, so it is no wonder that researchers are\nno longer keening to search the method for mathematically analyzing the data\nset in order to derive the single solution. However, TDSVD will offset this\ndeficiency and becomes an effectively autonomous method towards two-dimensional\ndata analysis. Mathematically, as long as there is enough orthogonality between\nany two 'ESSs' in any data set, the yield of the single solution is no longer a\nproblem. Therefore, TDSVD can be applied to lots of fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2020 06:08:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Apr 2020 01:14:21 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 28 Jun 2020 01:45:58 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2023 13:54:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-03"}

We study the design of ad auctions that, given fair\nbids, are guaranteed to produce fair outcomes. Following the works of Dwork and\nIlvento (2019) and Chawla et al. (2020), our goal is to design a truthful\nauction that satisfies ``individual fairness'' in its outcomes: informally\nspeaking, users that are similar to each other should obtain similar\nallocations of ads. Within this framework we quantify the tradeoff between\nsocial welfare maximization and fairness.\n  This work makes two conceptual contributions. First, we express the fairness\nconstraint as a kind of stability condition: any two users that are assigned\nmultiplicatively similar values by all the advertisers must receive additively\nsimilar allocations for each advertiser. This value stability constraint is\nexpressed as a function that maps the multiplicative distance between value\nvectors to the maximum allowable $\\ell_{\\infty}$ distance between the\ncorresponding allocations. Standard auctions do not satisfy this kind of value\nstability.\n  Second, we introduce a new class of allocation algorithms called Inverse\nProportional Allocation that achieve a near optimal tradeoff between fairness\nand social welfare for a broad and expressive class of value stability\nconditions. These allocation algorithms are truthful and prior-free, and\nachieve a constant factor approximation to the optimal (unconstrained) social\nwelfare. In particular, the approximation ratio is independent of the number of\nadvertisers in the system. In this respect, these allocation algorithms greatly\nsurpass the guarantees achieved in previous work. We also extend our results to\nbroader notions of fairness that we call subset fairness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2020 06:10:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Jul 2020 19:03:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 1 Dec 2021 03:16:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-02"}

Here\nwe provide theory-based measures of the reliance of U.S. businesses on human\ninteraction, detailed by industry and geographic location. We find that 49\nmillion workers work in occupations that rely heavily on face-to-face\ncommunication or require close physical proximity to other workers. Our model\nsuggests that when businesses are forced to reduce worker contacts by half,\nthey need a 12 percent wage subsidy to compensate for the disruption in\ncommunication.

Beyond global adjustments, professional image\nediting programs provide local adjustment tools operating on specific parts of\nan image. Options include parametric (graduated, radial filters) and\nunconstrained brush tools. These highly expressive tools enable a diverse set\nof local image enhancements. However, their use can be time consuming, and\nrequires artistic capability. State-of-the-art automated image enhancement\napproaches typically focus on learning pixel-level or global enhancements. The\nformer can be noisy and lack interpretability, while the latter can fail to\ncapture fine-grained adjustments. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach\nto automatically enhance images using learned spatially local filters of three\ndifferent types (Elliptical Filter, Graduated Filter, Polynomial Filter). We\nintroduce a deep neural network, dubbed Deep Local Parametric Filters\n(DeepLPF), which regresses the parameters of these spatially localized filters\nthat are then automatically applied to enhance the image. DeepLPF provides a\nnatural form of model regularization and enables interpretable, intuitive\nadjustments that lead to visually pleasing results. We report on multiple\nbenchmarks and show that DeepLPF produces state-of-the-art performance on two\nvariants of the MIT-Adobe-5K dataset, often using a fraction of the parameters\nrequired for competing methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2020 06:51:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-01"}

In contrast,\nrealistic noise removal for raw noisy videos is rarely studied due to the lack\nof noisy-clean pairs for dynamic scenes. Clean video frames for dynamic scenes\ncannot be captured with a long-exposure shutter or averaging multi-shots as was\ndone for static images.

One key process of SK-Net is the generation of\nspatial keypoints (Skeypoints).

Human-object interaction (HOI) detection strives\nto localize both the human and an object as well as the identification of\ncomplex interactions between them. Most existing HOI detection approaches are\ninstance-centric where interactions between all possible human-object pairs are\npredicted based on appearance features and coarse spatial information. We argue\nthat appearance features alone are insufficient to capture complex human-object\ninteractions. In this paper, we therefore propose a novel fully-convolutional\napproach that directly detects the interactions between human-object pairs. Our\nnetwork predicts interaction points, which directly localize and classify the\ninter-action. Paired with the densely predicted interaction vectors, the\ninteractions are associated with human and object detections to obtain final\npredictions.

Some of these have not previously been\nobserved via near-equilibrium compression of silicon. In this study, confocal\nRaman micro-spectroscopy and Raman imaging of arrays of microexplosions have\nbeen conducted to search for Raman signatures of these novel allotropes of\nsilicon. A microexplosion is generated at the interface between a thick silicon\ndioxide confinement layer and underlying silicon. It is characterised by a void\nat the interface above a region of compressed silicon. Raman data show a rich\nassembly of silicon phases within the modified silicon. Residual stresses up to\n4.5 GPa in the modifications have been determined from the shift in the main\ndiamond-cubic Si Raman peak. The computed Raman spectra for a number of Si\nallotropes show reasonable agreement with the experimental spectra. Two\nstructurally similar tetragonal phases of silicon (the rhombohedral r8 and the\nbody-centred bc8) phases as well as recently identified bt8-Si are all highly\nlikely to be contained in Raman spectra from many laser-modified sites.\nAlthough the st12-Si phase, previously observed in our electron diffraction\nstudies of the highly compressively stressed laser-modified regions, was not\nreliably identified from Raman data, we suggest this could be due to the\npossible difference in residual stress level in the sites analysed by the\nelectron diffraction and Raman spectra. Several other unidentified Raman peaks\nwere observed, suggesting the presence of other unknown silicon phases. All of\nthese silicon phases are expected to have attractive semiconducting properties\nincluding narrow band gap that open up novel applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2020 09:06:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-07"}

A direct\ncomputation of their crossed products is also carried out.

Since\nthe computational cost generally increases explosively along with the growth of\nvoxel resolution, most current state-of-the-arts have to tailor their framework\ninto a low-resolution representation with the sacrifice of detail prediction.\nThus, voxel resolution becomes one of the crucial difficulties that lead to the\nperformance bottleneck.\n  In this paper, we propose to devise a new geometry-based strategy to embed\ndepth information with low-resolution voxel representation, which could still\nbe able to encode sufficient geometric information, e.g., room layout, object's\nsizes and shapes, to infer the invisible areas of the scene with well\nstructure-preserving details. To this end, we first propose a novel 3D\nsketch-aware feature embedding to explicitly encode geometric information\neffectively and efficiently. With the 3D sketch in hand, we further devise a\nsimple yet effective semantic scene completion framework that incorporates a\nlight-weight 3D Sketch Hallucination module to guide the inference of occupancy\nand the semantic labels via a semi-supervised structure prior learning\nstrategy. We demonstrate that our proposed geometric embedding works better\nthan the depth feature learning from habitual SSC frameworks.

This protocol has been\ndesigned not only to train neural networks data-efficiently, but also to\nprovide privacy benefits for users, as their input data remains on device and\nonly parameter gradients are shared. But how secure is sharing parameter\ngradients? Previous attacks have provided a false sense of security, by\nsucceeding only in contrived settings - even for a single image. However, by\nexploiting a magnitude-invariant loss along with optimization strategies based\non adversarial attacks, we show that is is actually possible to faithfully\nreconstruct images at high resolution from the knowledge of their parameter\ngradients, and demonstrate that such a break of privacy is possible even for\ntrained deep networks. We analyze the effects of architecture as well as\nparameters on the difficulty of reconstructing an input image and prove that\nany input to a fully connected layer can be reconstructed analytically\nindependent of the remaining architecture.

This\nenables us to design a novel and general task-agnostic search space, which\ninserts cross-task edges (i.e., feature fusion connections) into fixed\nsingle-task network backbones. Moreover, we also propose a novel single-shot\ngradient-based search algorithm that closes the performance gap between the\nsearched architectures and the final evaluation architecture. This is realized\nwith a minimum entropy regularization on the architecture weights during the\nsearch phase, which makes the architecture weights converge to near-discrete\nvalues and therefore achieves a single model.

The timing performance can\nbe improved by implanting an internal gain layer that can produce signal with a\nfast rising edge, which improve significantly the signal-to-noise ratio. The\nrequired average timing resolution per track for a minimum-ionising particle is\n30 ps at the start and 50 ps at the end of the HL-LHC operation. This is\nachieved with several layers of LGAD. The innermost region of the detector\nwould accumulate a 1 MeV-neutron equivalent fluence up to $2.5 \\times 10^{15}\ncm^{-2}$ before being replaced during the scheduled shutdowns. The addition of\nthis new detector is expected to play an important role in the mitigation of\nhigh pile-up at the HL-LHC.

To explore the\nrole of eccentricity and the extra mass removal by jets we use the stellar\nevolutionary code MESA binary. The initial primary and secondary masses are\nM1i=15Mo and M2i=2.5Mo. We examine initial semi-major axes of 600-1000Ro, and\neccentricities of e=0-0.9. Both Roche lobe overflow (RLOF) and mass removal by\njets, followed by a wind, leave a hydrogen mass in the exploding star of\nM(H,f)=0.05Mo, compatible with a SN IIb progenitor. When the initial orbit is\nnot circular the final orbit might have a very high eccentricity.

For some\nranges of eccentricities the jets are more efficient in preventing the CEE.\nDespite the large uncertainties, extra mass removal by jets substantially\nincreases the likelihood of the system to get out from a CEE. This strengthens\nearlier conclusions for circular orbits. In some cases RLOF alone, without mass\nremoval by jets, can form SN IIb progenitors.

To protect such\napplications, one needs to guarantee that they are properly configured and\nsecurely provisioned with the \"secrets\" (e.g., encryption keys) necessary to\npreserve not only the confidentiality, integrity and freshness of their data\nbut also their code. Furthermore, these secrets should not be kept under the\ncontrol of a single stakeholder - which might be compromised and would\nrepresent a single point of failure - and they must be protected across\nsoftware versions in the sense that attackers cannot get access to them via\nmalicious updates.

However, these systems are often vulnerable to \\emph{evasion\nattacks}, in which an adversary manipulates malicious instances so that they\nare misidentified as benign. In this paper, we launch various innovative\nevasion attacks against several Android malware detection systems. The\nvulnerability inherent to all of these systems is that they are part of\nAndroguard~\\cite{desnos2011androguard}, a popular open source library used in\nAndroid malware detection systems. Some of the detection systems decrease to a\n0\\% detection rate after the attack. Therefore, the use of open source\nlibraries in malware detection systems calls for caution.\n  In addition, we present a novel evaluation scheme for evasion attack\ngeneration that exploits the weak spots of known Android malware detection\nsystems. In so doing, we evaluate the functionality and maliciousness of the\nmanipulated instances created by our evasion attacks. We found variations in\nboth the maliciousness and functionality tests of our manipulated apps. We show\nthat non-functional apps, while considered malicious, do not threaten users and\nare thus useless from an attacker's point of view. We conclude that evasion\nattacks must be assessed for both functionality and maliciousness to evaluate\ntheir impact, a step which is far from commonplace today.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2020 11:55:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-01"}

The space is assumed to be\n$C^2$ at all vertices and $C^1$ across edges, and the splines are uniquely\ndetermined by $C^2$-data at the vertices, values and normal derivatives at\nchosen points on the edges, and values at some additional points in the\ninterior of the elements.\n  The motivation for combining the Argyris triangle element with a recent $C^1$\nquadrilateral construction, inspired by isogeometric analysis, is two-fold: on\none hand, the ability to connect triangle and quadrilateral finite elements in\na $C^1$ fashion is non-trivial and of theoretical interest. We provide not only\napproximation error bounds but also numerical tests verifying the results. On\nthe other hand, the construction facilitates the meshing process by allowing\nmore flexibility while remaining $C^1$ everywhere. This is for instance\nrelevant when trimming of tensor-product B-splines is performed.\n  In the presented construction we assume to have (bi)linear element mappings\nand piecewise polynomial function spaces of arbitrary degree $p\\geq 5$. The\nbasis is simple to implement and the obtained results are optimal with respect\nto the mesh size for $L^\\infty$, $L^2$ as well as Sobolev norms $H^1$ and\n$H^2$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2020 12:19:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 9 Oct 2020 07:20:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-12"}

This approach ignores existing\npsychological theories to some degree, which provide explanations regarding the\nperception of events. For instance, the description that somebody discovers a\nsnake is associated with fear, based on the appraisal as being an unpleasant\nand non-controllable situation. This emotion reconstruction is even possible\nwithout having access to explicit reports of a subjective feeling (for instance\nexpressing this with the words \"I am afraid.\").

At first, we show that - under a necessary and sufficient condition on\nthe input data excitation - a data-based system representation can be derived\nfrom input-output data and used to replace an explicit system model. That is,\nthe fundamental result of Willems et al. is extended to this class of systems.\nSubsequently a data-driven internal model control formula for output-tracking\nis derived. The approach is illustrated via two simulation examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2020 12:48:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 2020 08:02:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-06"}

Traditionally, this has been done\nby coupling emitters, typically natural atoms and ions, to quantized\nelectromagnetic fields in optical and microwave cavities. In these systems, the\nemitter is approximated as an idealized dipole, as its physical size is orders\nof magnitude smaller than the wavelength of light. Recently, artificial atoms\nmade from superconducting circuits have enabled new frontiers in light-matter\ncoupling, including the study of \"giant\" atoms which cannot be approximated as\nsimple dipoles. Here, we explore a new implementation of a giant artificial\natom, formed from a transmon qubit coupled to propagating microwaves at\nmultiple points along an open transmission line. The nature of this coupling\nallows the qubit radiation field to interfere with itself leading to some\nstriking giant-atom effects. For instance, we observe strong\nfrequency-dependent couplings of the qubit energy levels to the electromagnetic\nmodes of the transmission line. Combined with the ability to in situ tune the\nqubit energy levels, we show that we can modify the relative coupling rates of\nmultiple qubit transitions by more than an order of magnitude. By doing so, we\nengineer a metastable excited state, allowing us to operate the giant transmon\nas an effective lambda system where we clearly demonstrate electromagnetically\ninduced transparency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2020 13:11:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-24"}

The socially\nawkward among us possess little instinct for pulling off such a maneuver, and\nmay benefit from a machine to do it for us. The method rests upon Bayes'\nTheorem, where the probability of a future model state depends on current\nknowledge of the model. Here, model state vectors are party attendees, and the\nfuture event of interest is their disposition toward us at times following the\nparty. We want these dispositions to be favorable.

The notion of \"event\" is broad, but\ntypically it applies to occurrences that can be detected from a single post or\na message. Little attention has been drawn to what we call \"micro-events\",\nwhich, due to their nature, cannot be detected from a single piece of textual\ninformation. The study investigates the feasibility of micro-event detection on\ntextual data using a sample of messages from the Stack Overflow Q&A platform\nand Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) version releases from Libraries.io\ndataset. We build pipelines for detection of micro-events using three different\nestimators whose parameters are optimized using a grid search approach. We\nconsider two feature spaces: LDA topic modeling with sentiment analysis, and\nhSBM topics with sentiment analysis. The feature spaces are optimized using the\nrecursive feature elimination with cross validation (RFECV) strategy.\n  In our experiments we investigate whether there is a characteristic change in\nthe topics distribution or sentiment features before or after micro-events take\nplace and we thoroughly evaluate the capacity of each variant of our analysis\npipeline to detect micro-events. Additionally, we perform a detailed\nstatistical analysis of the models, including influential cases, variance\ninflation factors, validation of the linearity assumption, pseudo R squared\nmeasures and no-information rate. Finally, in order to study limits of\nmicro-event detection, we design a method for generating micro-event synthetic\ndatasets with similar properties to the real-world data, and use them to\nidentify the micro-event detectability threshold for each of the evaluated\nclassifiers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Mar 2020 16:55:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2020 10:50:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 19 Dec 2020 12:49:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-25"}

The experimental exploration of\nendofullerene arrays comes at a time when machine learning techniques are\nrapidly being adopted to characterize, verify, and reconstruct quantum states\nfrom measurement data. In this paper, we develop a strategy for reconstructing\nthe ground state of chains of dipolar rotors using restricted Boltzmann\nmachines (RBMs) adapted to train on data from higher-dimensional Hilbert\nspaces. We demonstrate accurate generation of energy expectation values from an\nRBM trained on data in the free-rotor eigenstate basis, and explore the\nlearning resources required for various chain lengths and dipolar interaction\nstrengths. Finally, we show evidence for fundamental limitations in the\naccuracy achievable by RBMs due to the difficulty in imposing symmetries in the\nsampling procedure. We discuss possible avenues to overcome this limitation in\nthe future, including the further development of autoregressive models such as\nrecurrent neural networks for the purposes of quantum state reconstruction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2020 14:56:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Jul 2020 16:53:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-07"}

In\nour method, users and news are both viewed as nodes in a bipartite graph\nconstructed from historical user click behaviors. For news representations, a\ntransformer architecture is first exploited to build news semantic\nrepresentations. Then we combine it with the information from neighbor news in\nthe graph via a graph attention network.

The Renormalisation Group evolution of an observable predicts the\nfunctional form of its residual cutoff dependence on the breakdown scale of an\nEFT, on the low-momentum scales, and on the order of the calculation. Passing\nthis test is a necessary but not sufficient consistency criterion for a\nsuggested power counting whose exact nature is disputed. In Chiral Effective\nField Theory (ChiEFT) with more than one nucleon, a lack of universally\naccepted analytic solutions obfuscates the convergence pattern in results. This\nled to proposals which predict different sets of Low Energy Coefficients (LECs)\nat the same chiral order, and at times even predict a different ordering\nlong-range contributions. The method may independently check whether an\nobservable is renormalised at a given order, and proves estimates of both the\nbreakdown scale and the momentum-dependent order-by-order convergence pattern.\nConversely, it helps identify those LECs (and long-range pieces) which ensure\nrenormalised observables at a given order. I also discuss assumptions and the\nrelation to Wilson's Renormalisation Group; useful observable and cutoff\nchoices; the momentum window with likely best signals; its dependence on the\nvalues and forms of cutoffs as well as on the EFT parameters; the impact of\nfitting LECs to data; and caveats as well as limitations. Since the test is\ndesigned to minimise the use of data, it quantitatively falsifies if the EFT\nhas been renormalised consistently. This complements other tests which quantify\nhow an EFT compares to experiment. Its application in particular to the 3P0 and\nP2-3F2 partial waves of NN scattering in ChiEFT may elucidate persistent\npower-counting issues.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Mar 2020 21:21:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 2020 22:33:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-20"}

Despite the implementation\nof long sought ITS protocols poses the crucial need to detail how the features\nof optical stages influence the overall performances of a VLC system in\nrealistic configurations, such characterization has rarely been addressed at\npresent. We carried out an experimental investigation in a realistic\nconfiguration where a regular traffic light (TX), enabled for VLC transmission,\nsends digital information towards a receiving stage (RX), composed by an\noptical condenser and a dedicated amplified photodiode stage. We performed a\ndetailed measurements campaign of VLC performances encompassing a broad set of\noptical condensers, and for TX-RX distances in the range 3 - 50 m, in terms of\nboth effective field of view (EFOV) and packet error rate (PER). The results\nshow several nontrivial behaviors for different lens sets as a function of\nposition on the measurement grid, highlighting critical aspects as well as\nidentifying most suitable optical configurations depending on the specific\napplication and on the required EFOV. In this paper we also provide a\ntheoretical model for both the signal intensity and the EFOV as a function of\nseveral parameters, such as distance, RX orientation and focal length of the\nspecific condenser. Our results could be very relevant in the near future to\nassess a most suited solution in terms of acceptance angle when designing a VLC\nsystem for real applications, where angle-dependent misalignment effects play a\nnon-negligible role, and we argue that it could have more general implications\nwith respect to the pristine I2V case mentioned here.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2020 15:22:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-03"}

Phase randomisation requires, however,\nthe availability of a pseudo-random number generator as well as trigonometric\nfunctions such as cos and sin.

A simulated study is carried out to investigate\nthe use of relatively small lookup tables where random numbers are repeated in\nsequence.

However, the concept of reliability in its strict sense\nis missing in financial services. Therefore, in order to fill this gap, in a\nfirst-of-its-kind-study, we define the reliability of a bank/firm in terms of\nthe financial ratios connoting the financial health of the bank to withstand\nthe likelihood of insolvency or bankruptcy. For the purpose of estimating the\nreliability of a bank, we invoke a statistical and machine learning algorithm\nnamely, logistic regression (LR). Once, the parameters are estimated in the 1st\nstage, we fix them and treat the financial ratios as decision variables. Thus,\nin the 1st stage, we accomplish the hitherto unknown way of estimating the\nreliability of a bank. Subsequently, in the 2nd stage, in order to maximize the\nreliability of the bank, we formulate an unconstrained optimization problem in\na single-objective environment and solve it using the well-known particle swarm\noptimization (PSO) algorithm. Thus, in essence, these two stages correspond to\npredictive and prescriptive analytics respectively. The proposed 2-stage\nstrategy of using them in tandem is beneficial to the decision-makers within a\nbank who can try to achieve the optimal or near-optimal values of the financial\nratios in order to maximize the reliability which is tantamount to safeguarding\ntheir bank against solvency or bankruptcy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Mar 2020 00:37:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-24"}

Cold atmospheric plasma (CAP), is a near\nroom temperature ionized gas composed of reactive species, charged particles,\nneutral particles, and electrons. CAP also has several physical factors\nincluding thermal radiation, ultraviolet (UV) radiation, and electromagnetic\n(EM) waves. Most of the previously reported biological effects of CAP have\nrelied on direct contact between bulk plasma and cells, resulting in the\nchemical effects generally seen after CAP treatment. In this paper, we\ndemonstrate that the electromagnetic emission produced by CAP can lead to the\ndeath of B16F10 melanoma cancer cells via a transbarrier contactless method.\nWhen compared with the effect of reactive species, the effect of the physical\nfactors causes much greater growth inhibition. The physical-triggered growth\ninhibition is due to a new type of cell death, characterized by rapid leakage\nof bulk water from the cells, resulting in bubbles on the cell membrane, and\ncytoplasm shrinkage. The results of this study introduce a new possible\nmechanism of CAP induced cancer cell death and build a foundation for CAP to be\nused as a non-invasive cancer treatment in the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Mar 2020 18:10:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-30"}
