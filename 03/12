In this paper, we propose a novel fashion\ncollocation framework, Neural Graph Filtering, that models a flexible set of\nfashion items via a graph neural network. Specifically, we consider the visual\nembeddings of each garment as a node in the graph, and describe the\ninter-garment relationship as the edge between nodes. By applying symmetric\noperations on the edge vectors, this framework allows varying numbers of\ninputs/outputs and is invariant to their ordering. We further include a style\nclassifier augmented with focal loss to enable the collocation of significantly\ndiverse styles, which are inherently imbalanced in the training set. To\nfacilitate a comprehensive study on diverse fashion collocation, we reorganize\nAmazon Fashion dataset with carefully designed evaluation protocols. We\nevaluate the proposed approach on three popular benchmarks, the Polyvore\ndataset, the Polyvore-D dataset, and our reorganized Amazon Fashion dataset.\nExtensive experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms\nthe state-of-the-art methods with over 10% improvements on the standard AUC\nmetric on the established tasks. More importantly, 82.5% of the users prefer\nour diverse-style recommendations over other alternatives in a real-world\nperception study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Mar 2020 16:17:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-12"}

Thus, developing\naccurate ways to compare FCs is essential to establish associations with\nbehavior and/or cognition at the individual-level.\n  Methods: Canonically, FCs are compared using Pearson's correlation\ncoefficient of the entire functional connectivity profiles. Recently, it has\nbeen proposed that the use of geodesic distance is a more accurate way of\ncomparing functional connectomes, one which reflects the underlying\nnon-Euclidean geometry of the data. Computing geodesic distance requires FCs to\nbe positive-definite and hence invertible matrices. As this requirement depends\non the fMRI scanning length and the parcellation used, it is not always\nattainable and sometimes a regularization procedure is required.\n  Results: In the present work, we show that regularization is not only an\nalgebraic operation for making FCs invertible, but also that an optimal\nmagnitude of regularization leads to systematically higher fingerprints. We\nalso show evidence that optimal regularization is dataset-dependent, and varies\nas a function of condition, parcellation, scanning length, and the number of\nframes used to compute the FCs.\n  Discussion: We demonstrate that a universally fixed regularization does not\nfully uncover the potential of geodesic distance on individual fingerprinting,\nand indeed could severely diminish it. Thus, an optimal regularization must be\nestimated on each dataset to uncover the most differentiable across-subject and\nreproducible within-subject geodesic distances between FCs. The resulting\npairwise geodesic distances at the optimal regularization level constitute a\nvery reliable quantification of differences between subjects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Mar 2020 16:32:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 29 Aug 2020 01:23:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 31 Mar 2021 15:36:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-01"}

In this study, we analyse VLT/CRIRES (R = 100,000)\nL-band observations of the non-transiting giant planet HD 179949 b centred\naround 3.5 microns. We observe a weak (3.0 sigma, or S/N = 4.8) spectral\nsignature of H2O in absorption contained within the radial velocity of the\nplanet at superior-conjunction, with a mild dependence on the choice of line\nlist used for the modelling. Combining this data with previous observations in\nthe K-band, we measure a detection significance of 8.4 sigma for an atmosphere\nthat is most consistent with a shallow lapse-rate, solar C/O ratio, and with CO\nand H2O being the only major sources of opacity in this wavelength range. As\nthe two sets of data were taken three years apart, this points to the absence\nof strong radial-velocity anomalies due, e.g., to variability in atmospheric\ncirculation. We measure a projected orbital velocity for the planet of KP =\n(145.2 +- 2.0)kms^{-1} (1 sigma) and improve the error bars on this parameter\nby ~70%. However, we only marginally tighten constraints on orbital inclination\n(66.2 +3.7 -3.1 degrees) and planet mass (0.963 +0.036 -0.031 Jupiter masses),\ndue to the dominant uncertainties of stellar mass and semi-major axis. Follow\nups of radial-velocity planets are thus crucial to fully enable their accurate\ncharacterisation via high resolution spectroscopy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Mar 2020 16:39:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-25"}

It is often\npresumed that the formation of segregated polymer-colloid layers is solely due\nto the proportion in size at fast evaporation as in binary colloid mixtures. By\ncomparing experiments with a theoretical model, we found that the transition in\nviscosity near the drying interface was another important parameter for\ncontrolling the formation of stratified layers in polymer-colloid mixtures. At\nhigh evaporation rates, increased polymer concentrations near the surface lead\nto a phase transition from semidilute to concentrated regime, in which\ncolloidal particles are kinetically arrested. Stratification only occurs if the\nformation of a stratified layer precedes the evolution to the concentrated\nregime near the drying interfaces. Otherwise, the colloids will be trapped by\nthe polymers in the concentrated regime before forming a segregated layer.\nAlso, no stratification is observed if the initial polymer concentration is too\nlow to form a sufficiently high polymer concentration gradient within a short\nperiod of time. Our findings are relevant for developing solution-cast polymer\ncomposite for painting, antifouling and antireflective coatings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Mar 2020 16:40:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-12"}

In such a problem, not only can the number\nof functions measured per sample be large, but each function is itself an\ninfinite-dimensional object, making estimation of model parameters challenging.\nThis is further complicated by the fact that curves are usually observed only\nat discrete time points. We first define a functional differential graph that\ncaptures the differences between two functional graphical models and formally\ncharacterize when the functional differential graph is well defined. We then\npropose a method, FuDGE, that directly estimates the functional differential\ngraph without first estimating each individual graph. This is particularly\nbeneficial in settings where the individual graphs are dense but the\ndifferential graph is sparse. We show that FuDGE consistently estimates the\nfunctional differential graph even in a high-dimensional setting for both fully\nobserved and discretely observed function paths. We illustrate the finite\nsample properties of our method through simulation studies.

To mitigate these disadvantages, we propose to\ncombine two image restoration approaches: (i) Deep Image Prior (DIP), which\ntrains a convolutional neural network (CNN) from scratch in test time using the\ngiven degraded image. It does not require any training data and builds on the\nimplicit prior imposed by the CNN architecture; and (ii) a backprojection (BP)\nfidelity term, which is an alternative to the standard least squares loss that\nis usually used in previous DIP works.

Our approach\nuses a multi-layer neural network to approximate unknown dynamics needed for\nthe feedforward control. The network may be viewed as a linear-in-parameter\nrepresentation of the robot dynamics, with the nonlinear basis of the robot\ndynamics connected to the linear output layer. The output layer weights are\nupdated based on the tracking error and the nonlinear basis. The internal\nweights of the nonlinear basis are updated by online backpropagation to further\nreduce the tracking error. To use time scale separation to reduce the coupling\nof the two steps - the update of the internal weights is at a lower rate\ncompared to the update of the output layer weights. With the update of the\noutput layer weights, our controller adapts quickly to the unknown dynamics\nchange and disturbances (such as attaching a load).

In this paper, we investigate two\nstrategies for decreasing this overlap: (i) utilizing time dependence by\nfitting multiple drift-scan spectra simultaneously and (ii) measuring all four\nStokes parameters instead of only the total power, Stokes I. Although measuring\npolarization requires different instruments than are used in most existing\nexperiments, all existing experiments can utilize drift-scan measurements\nmerely by averaging their data differently. In order to evaluate the increase\nin constraining power from using these two techniques, we define a method for\nconnecting Root-Mean-Square (RMS) uncertainties to probabilistic confidence\nlevels. Employing simulations, we find that fitting only one total power\nspectrum leads to RMS uncertainties at the few K level, while fitting multiple\ntime-binned, drift-scan spectra yields uncertainties at the $\\lesssim 10$ mK\nlevel. This significant improvement only appears if the spectra are modeled\nwith one set of basis vectors, instead of using multiple sets of basis vectors\nthat independently model each spectrum.

While image saliency modeling is a\nwell-studied problem and progress on benchmarks like SALICON and MIT300 is\nslowing, video saliency models have shown rapid gains on the recent DHF1K\nbenchmark. Here, we take a step back and ask: Can image and video saliency\nmodeling be approached via a unified model, with mutual benefit? We identify\ndifferent sources of domain shift between image and video saliency data and\nbetween different video saliency datasets as a key challenge for effective\njoint modelling. To address this we propose four novel domain adaptation\ntechniques - Domain-Adaptive Priors, Domain-Adaptive Fusion, Domain-Adaptive\nSmoothing and Bypass-RNN - in addition to an improved formulation of learned\nGaussian priors. We integrate these techniques into a simple and lightweight\nencoder-RNN-decoder-style network, UNISAL, and train it jointly with image and\nvideo saliency data. We evaluate our method on the video saliency datasets\nDHF1K, Hollywood-2 and UCF-Sports, and the image saliency datasets SALICON and\nMIT300. With one set of parameters, UNISAL achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance on all video saliency datasets and is on par with the\nstate-of-the-art for image saliency datasets, despite faster runtime and a 5 to\n20-fold smaller model size compared to all competing deep methods. We provide\nretrospective analyses and ablation studies which confirm the importance of the\ndomain shift modeling.

Moreover, we show that the\ncumulative $\\gamma$-ray emission of below-threshold galaxies is also\nsignificantly detected at $\\sim$5\\,$\\sigma$ confidence. The $\\gamma$-ray\nluminosity of resolved and unresolved galaxies is found to correlate with the\ntotal (8-1000\\,$\\mu$m) infrared luminosity as previously determined. Above\n1\\,GeV, the spectral energy distribution of resolved and unresolved galaxies is\nfound to be compatible with a power law with a photon index of\n$\\approx2.2-2.3$.\n  Finally, we find that star-forming galaxies account for roughly 5\\,\\% and\n3\\,\\% of the extragalactic $\\gamma$-ray background and the IceCube neutrino\nflux, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Mar 2020 19:18:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Apr 2020 13:23:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-20"}

A common approach to achieving resilient vector consensus is that\nevery non-adversarial (or normal) agent in the network updates its state by\nmoving towards a point in the convex hull of its \\emph{normal} neighbors'\nstates. Since an agent cannot distinguish between its normal and adversarial\nneighbors, computing such a point, often called as \\emph{safe point}, is a\nchallenging task. To compute a safe point, we propose to use the notion of\n\\emph{centerpoint}, which is an extension of the median in higher dimensions,\ninstead of Tverberg partition of points, which is often used for this purpose.\nWe discuss that the notion of centerpoint provides a complete characterization\nof safe points in $\\mathbb{R}^d$. In particular, we show that a safe point is\nessentially an interior centerpoint if the number of adversaries in the\nneighborhood of a normal agent $i$ is less than $\\frac{N_i}{d+1} $, where $d$\nis the dimension of the state vector and $N_i$ is the total number of agents in\nthe neighborhood of $i$. Consequently, we obtain necessary and sufficient\nconditions on the number of adversarial agents to guarantee resilient vector\nconsensus. Further, by considering the complexity of computing centerpoints, we\ndiscuss improvements in the resilience guarantees of vector consensus\nalgorithms and compare with the other existing approaches. Finally, we\nnumerically evaluate the performance of our approach through experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Mar 2020 19:25:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 14 Aug 2021 19:49:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-17"}

However, its\nenergy consumption becomes substantial, when the transmission link used for\nwireless energy transfer (WET) and for computation offloading is hostile. To\nmitigate this hindrance, we propose to employ the emerging technique of\nintelligent reflecting surface (IRS) in WP-MEC systems, which is capable of\nproviding an additional link both for WET and for computation offloading.\nSpecifically, we consider a multi-user scenario where both the WET and the\ncomputation offloading are based on orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing\n(OFDM) systems. Built on this model, an innovative framework is developed to\nminimize the energy consumption of the IRS-aided WP-MEC network, by optimizing\nthe power allocation of the WET signals, the local computing frequencies of\nwireless devices, both the sub-band-device association and the power allocation\nused for computation offloading, as well as the IRS reflection coefficients.\nThe major challenges of this optimization lie in the strong coupling between\nthe settings of WET and of computing as well as the unit-modules constraint on\nIRS reflection coefficients. To tackle these issues, the technique of\nalternative optimization is invoked for decoupling the WET and computing\ndesigns, while two sets of locally optimal IRS reflection coefficients are\nprovided for WET and for computation offloading separately relying on the\nsuccessive convex approximation method. The numerical results demonstrate that\nour proposed scheme is capable of monumentally outperforming the conventional\nWP-MEC network without IRSs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Mar 2020 20:31:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-13"}

Daysides are predicted to be\ncloud-free, dominated by atomic species and substantially hotter than\nnightsides. Atoms are expected to recombine into molecules over the nightside,\nresulting in different day-night chemistry. While metallic elements and a large\ntemperature contrast have been observed, no chemical gradient has been measured\nacross the surface of such an exoplanet. Different atmospheric chemistry\nbetween the day-to-night (\"evening\") and night-to-day (\"morning\") terminators\ncould, however, be revealed as an asymmetric absorption signature during\ntransit. Here, we report the detection of an asymmetric atmospheric signature\nin the ultra-hot exoplanet WASP-76b. We spectrally and temporally resolve this\nsignature thanks to the combination of high-dispersion spectroscopy with a\nlarge photon-collecting area. The absorption signal, attributed to neutral\niron, is blueshifted by -11+/-0.7 km s-1 on the trailing limb, which can be\nexplained by a combination of planetary rotation and wind blowing from the hot\ndayside. In contrast, no signal arises from the nightside close to the morning\nterminator, showing that atomic iron is not absorbing starlight there. Iron\nmust thus condense during its journey across the nightside.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 11 Mar 2020 21:30:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-13"}

The doubly charged\nscalars are part of a degenerate fermiophobic custodial fiveplet with states\n$H_5^{\\pm\\pm}$, $H_5^\\pm$, and $H_5^0$ and common mass $m_5$. The GM model has\nbeen extensively studied at the LHC for $m_5 > 200$ GeV but there is a largely\nunprobed region of parameter space from $120$ GeV $< m_5 < 200$ GeV where light\ndoubly-charged scalars could exist. This region has been neglected by\nexperimental searches due in part to the lack of a benchmark for $m_5 < 200$\nGeV. In this paper we propose a new \"low-$m_5$\" benchmark for the GM model,\ndefined for $m_5 \\in (50, 550)$ GeV, and characterize its properties. We apply\nall existing experimental constraints and summarize the phenomenology of the\nsurviving parameter space.

The\nprocess $pp \\to H \\to H_5 H_5$ contributes in a small region of parameter\nspace, but is small compared to the Drell-Yan production cross section. Finally\nwe compute the branching ratios of $H_5^0 \\to \\gamma\\gamma$ and $H_5^{\\pm} \\to\nW^{\\pm} \\gamma$.

To this end, we\nleverage the idea of directed fuzzing and design RoboFuzz that systematically\ntests an autonomous service robot in line with the robot's states and the\nsurrounding environment. The methodology of RoboFuzz is to study critical\nenvironmental parameters affecting the robot's state transitions and subject\nthe robot control program with rational but harmful sensor values so as to\ncompromise the robot. Furthermore, we develop detection and mitigation\nalgorithms to counteract the impact of RoboFuzz. The difficulties mainly lie in\nthe trade-off among limited computation resources, timely detection and the\nretention of work efficiency in mitigation. In particular, we propose detection\nand mitigation methods that take advantage of historical records of obstacles\nto detect inconsistent obstacle appearances regarding untrustworthy sensor\nvalues and navigate the movable robot to continue moving so as to carry on a\nplanned task. By doing so, we manage to maintain a low cost for detection and\nmitigation but also retain the robot's work efficacy.

Without intelligent and automated\ndecision making that can trade off conflicting requirements, a large PV system\nand a large battery is needed to provide meaningful resiliency. By using\nforecast of solar generation and household demand, an intelligent decision\nmaker can operate the equipment (battery and critical loads) to ensure that the\ncritical loads are serviced to the maximum duration possible. With the aid of\nsuch an intelligent control system, a smaller (and thus lower cost) system can\nservice the primary loads for the same duration that a much larger system will\nbe needed to service otherwise.\n  In this paper we propose such an intelligent control system.

In this paper, we first propose a novel MLCS algorithm NP-MLCS1\nfor the big sequence analysis, which can calculate the common model for\nCOVID-19 complete genome sequences to provide important information for vaccine\nand antibody development. Geographic and time-course analysis of the evolution\ntrees of the human COVID-19 reveals possible evolutional paths among strains\nfrom 79 countries. This finding has important implications to the management of\nCOVID-19 and the development of vaccines and medications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Mar 2020 02:33:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Mar 2020 07:12:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 20 Mar 2020 14:04:34 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 2020 09:01:47 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 21 Jul 2020 08:04:10 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Sun, 16 Aug 2020 03:54:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-18"}

We\nconfirm the conjecture that computing $\\lambda_\\infty$ is NP-hard for weighted\ntrees.\n  Beyond measuring connectivity in many applications we want to optimize it.\nThis, via convex duality, leads to a problem in machine learning known as the\nMaximum Variance Embedding (MVE). The output is a function from vertices to a\nlow dim Euclidean space, subject to bounds on Euclidean distances between\nneighbors. The objective is to maximize output variance. Special cases of MVE\ninto $n$ and $1$ dims lead to absolute algebraic connectivity [1990] and spread\nconstant [1998], that measure connectivity of the graph and its Cartesian\n$n$-power, respectively. MVE has other applications in measuring diffusion\nspeed and robustness of networks, clustering, and dimension reduction.\n  We show that computing MVE in tree-width dims is NP-hard, while only one\nadditional dim beyond width of a given tree-decomposition makes the problem in\nP.

The encoder of M-SFANet is enhanced with ASPP containing parallel atrous\nconvolutional layers with different sampling rates and hence able to extract\nmulti-scale features of the target object and incorporate larger context. To\nfurther deal with scale variation throughout an input image, we leverage the\nCAN module which adaptively encodes the scales of the contextual information.\nThe combination yields an effective model for counting in both dense and sparse\ncrowd scenes. Based on the SFANet decoder structure, M-SFANet's decoder has\ndual paths, for density map and attention map generation. The second model is\ncalled M-SegNet, which is produced by replacing the bilinear upsampling in\nSFANet with max unpooling that is used in SegNet. This change provides a faster\nmodel while providing competitive counting performance. Designed for high-speed\nsurveillance applications, M-SegNet has no additional multi-scale-aware module\nin order to not increase the complexity.

Specifically, instead of maintaining all the low rank matrices\nand sensitive rating data for training, we propose a random walk based\ndecentralized training technique to train MF models on each user's end, e.g.,\ncell phone and Pad. By doing so, the ratings of each user are still kept on\none's own hand, and moreover, decentralized learning can be taken as\ndistributed learning with multi-learners (users), and thus alleviates the\ncomputation and storage issue.

Despite the\nimportance of controlling the growth of microbial colonies and biofilms in a\nvariety of medical and industrial settings, the underlying physical mechanisms\nbehind single-cell dynamics, collective behaviors of densely-packed cells, and\n3D complex colony expansion remain largely unknown. In this work, we explore\nthe mechanisms behind the 2D-to-3D transition of motile Pseudomonas aeruginosa\ncolonies; we provide a new motility-induced, rate-dependent buckling mechanism\nfor their out-of-plane growth. We find that swarming of motile bacterial\ncolonies generate sustained in-plane flows. We show that the viscous shear\nstresses and dynamic pressures arising from these flows allow cells to overcome\ncell-substrate adhesion, leading to buckling of bacterial monolayers and growth\ninto the third dimension. Modeling bacterial monolayers as 2D fluid films, we\nidentify universal relationships that elucidate the competition between\nin-plane viscous stresses, pressure and cell-substrate adhesion. Furthermore,\nwe show that bacterial monolayers can exhibit crossover from swarming to\nkinetically-arrested, glassy-like states above an onset density, resulting in\ndistinct 2D-to-3D transition mechanisms. Combining experimental observations of\nP. aeruginosa colonies at single-cell resolution, molecular dynamics\nsimulations of active systems, and theories of glassy dynamics and 2D fluid\nfilms, we develop a dynamical state diagram that predicts the state of the\ncolony, and the mechanisms governing their 2D-to-3D transitions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Mar 2020 04:51:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-13"}

Therefore, studying the damage mechanics of this kind of\ndevices is fundamental to understand and accurately describe their\nthermomechanical behavior, so that seismically isolated structures can be\ndesigned more safely.\n  Traditionally, up to this point, the hysteretic behavior of LBR has been\nmodeled using 1) Newtonian mechanics and empirical curve fitting degradation\nfunctions, or 2) heat conduction theories and idealized bilinear curves which\ninclude degradation effects. The reason for using models that are essentially\nphenomenological or that contain some adjusted parameters is the fact that\nuniversal laws of motion by Newton lack the term to account for degradation and\nenergy loss of a system.

Top-performing\ninstance segmentation methods such as Mask R-CNN rely on ROI operations\n(typically ROIPool or ROIAlign) to obtain the final instance masks. In\ncontrast, we propose to solve instance segmentation from a new perspective.\nInstead of using instance-wise ROIs as inputs to a network of fixed weights, we\nemploy dynamic instance-aware networks, conditioned on instances. CondInst\nenjoys two advantages: 1) Instance segmentation is solved by a fully\nconvolutional network, eliminating the need for ROI cropping and feature\nalignment. 2) Due to the much improved capacity of dynamically-generated\nconditional convolutions, the mask head can be very compact (e.g., 3 conv.\nlayers, each having only 8 channels), leading to significantly faster\ninference. We demonstrate a simpler instance segmentation method that can\nachieve improved performance in both accuracy and inference speed. On the COCO\ndataset, we outperform a few recent methods including well-tuned Mask RCNN\nbaselines, without longer training schedules needed.\n  Code is available: https://github.com/aim-uofa/adet\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Mar 2020 08:42:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Mar 2020 00:50:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 19 Mar 2020 13:38:31 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 26 Jul 2020 02:18:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-28"}

The orbits of these binaries\nshow a strong correlation between their orbital periods and mass ratios. The\norigins of this correlation have, so far, been lacking a conclusive\nexplanation. We aim to find a binary evolution model which can explain the\nobserved correlation. Radii of evolved red giants, and hence the resulting\norbital periods, strongly depend on their metallicity. We have performed a\nsmall but statistically significant binary population synthesis study with the\nbinary stellar evolution code MESA. We have used a standard model for binary\nmass loss and a standard Galactic metallicity history. The resulting sdBs were\nselected based on the same criteria as used in observations and then compared\nwith the observed population. We have achieved an excellent match to the\nobserved period - mass ratio correlation without explicitly fine-tuning any\nparameters. Furthermore, our models produce a good match to the observed period\n- metallicity correlation. We predict several new correlations which link the\nobserved sdB binaries to their progenitors, and a correlation between the\nperiod, metallicity and core mass for subdwarfs and young low-mass He white\ndwarfs. We also predict that sdB binaries have distinct orbital properties\ndepending on whether they formed in the bulge, thin or thick disc, or the halo.\nWe demonstrate, for the first time, how the metallicity history of the Milky\nWay is imprinted in the properties of the observed post-mass transfer binaries.\nWe show that Galactic chemical evolution is an important factor in binary\npopulation studies of interacting systems containing at least one evolved\nlow-mass (Mi < 1.6 Msol) component. Finally, we provide an observationally\nsupported model of mass transfer from low-mass red giants onto main-sequence\nstars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Mar 2020 08:57:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Jul 2020 14:41:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 18 Aug 2020 11:18:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-30"}

To address this\nproblem, we propose a novel AE that can learn more semantically meaningful\nfeatures.

Therefore, we force the AE to learn\nsuch features by penalizing networks with a bottleneck layer that is unstable\nagainst adversarial perturbations.

Although rare, some bursts display episodes of early emission, with\nprecursor flares being observed up to $\\sim 10$ seconds prior to the main\nburst. As the stars inspiral due to gravitational wave emission, the exertion\nof mutual tidal forces leads to the excitation of stellar oscillation modes,\nwhich may come into resonance with the orbital motion. Mode amplitudes increase\nsubstantially during a period of resonance as tidal energy is deposited into\nthe star. The neutron star crust experiences shear stress due to the\noscillations and, if the resonant amplitudes are large enough, may become\nover-strained.

Quantum\nsuperchannels with multiple slots are deterministic transformations whichtake\nindependent quantum operations as inputs. While they are enforced to respect\nthe laws of quantum mechanics, the use of input operations may lack a definite\ncausal order, and characterizations of general superchannels in terms of\nquantum objects with a physical implementation have been missing. In this\npaper, we provide a mathematical characterization for pure superchannels with\ntwo slots (also known as bipartite pure processes), which are superchannels\npreserving the reversibility of quantum operations. We show that the\nreversibility preserving condition restricts all pure superchannels with two\nslots to be either a quantum circuit only consisting of unitary operations or a\ncoherent superposition of two unitary quantum circuits where the two input\noperations are differently ordered. The latter may be seen as a generalization\nof the quantum switch, allowing a physical interpretation for pure two-slot\nsuperchannels. An immediate corollary is that purifiable bipartite processes\ncannot violate device-independent causal inequalities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Mar 2020 09:46:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 2020 14:13:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 17 Apr 2021 15:32:44 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 23 Apr 2021 08:01:27 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 27 Apr 2021 12:26:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-28"}

Differing from the\nprevious studies, we propose a new method called Denoising Autoencoder with\nTemporal and Categorical Constraints (DAE_CTC)} to study the skeletal\nrepresentation in a view of skeleton reconstruction. Based on the concept of\nlearning under privileged information, we integrate action categories and\ntemporal coordinates into a stacked denoising autoencoder in the training\nphase, to preserve category and temporal feature, while learning the hidden\nrepresentation from a skeleton. Thus, we are able to improve the discriminative\nvalidity of the hidden representation. In order to mitigate the variation\nresulting from temporary misalignment, a new method of temporal registration,\ncalled Locally-Warped Sequence Registration (LWSR), is proposed for registering\nthe sequences of inter- and intra-class actions.

In recent years, machine learning based systems have been widely used\nto detect DGAs. There are several well known state-of-the-art classifiers in\nthe literature that can detect DGA domain names in real-time applications with\nhigh predictive performance. However, these DGA classifiers are highly\nvulnerable to adversarial attacks in which adversaries purposely craft domain\nnames to evade DGA detection classifiers. In our work, we focus on hardening\nDGA classifiers against adversarial attacks.

Another view is that Venus had a long lived (approximately 100 million\nyear) primordial magma ocean with a CO2 and steam atmosphere.

The numerical smoothing\ntechnique is based on root-finding methods combined with one-dimensional\nnumerical integration with respect to a single well-chosen variable.

The main casualty of Bell's model with hidden\nvariables is that it straightforwardly contradicts to the Heinsenberg's\nuncertainty and generally Bohr's complementarity principles. Thus, we do not\ncriticize the derivation or interpretation of the Bell inequality (as was done\nby numerous authors). Our critique is directed against the model as it is. The\noriginal Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) argument was based on the Heinseberg's\nprinciple, but EPR did not question it. Hence, the arguments of EPR and Bell\ndiffer crucially. It is worth to find the physical seed of the aforementioned\nprinciples. This is the {\\it quantum postulate}: the existence of indivisible\nquantum of action. Bell's approach with hidden variable straightforwardly\nimplies rejection of the quantum postulate. Heisenberg compared the quantum\npostulate with constancy of light's velocity in special relativity. Thus\nattempts to explain long distance correlations within the Bell model can be\ncompared with attempts to construct models violating the laws of relativity\ntheory.

In this work, we hypothesize that item\nknowledge graph (KG), which provides rich relations among items and KG\nentities, could be useful to infer informative and factual negative samples.\nTowards this end, we develop a new negative sampling model, Knowledge Graph\nPolicy Network (KGPolicy), which works as a reinforcement learning agent to\nexplore high-quality negatives. Specifically, by conducting our designed\nexploration operations, it navigates from the target positive interaction,\nadaptively receives knowledge-aware negative signals, and ultimately yields a\npotential negative item to train the recommender. We tested on a matrix\nfactorization (MF) model equipped with KGPolicy, and it achieves significant\nimprovements over both state-of-the-art sampling methods like DNS and IRGAN,\nand KG-enhanced recommender models like KGAT.

Our algorithm determined further complex\nstructure and permitted another merging phase, revealing two complex-structured\ngroups at the highest level.

The paper\nanalyses whether there are different patterns of mortality decline among\ndeveloped countries, identifying the role played by all the mortality\ncomponents. We implement a cluster analysis using a Functional Data Analysis\n(FDA) approach, which allows us to consider age-specific mortality rather than\nsummary measures as it analyses curves rather than scalar data. Combined with a\nFunctional Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method it can identify what part\nof the curves (mortality components) is responsible for assigning one country\nto a specific cluster. FDA clustering is applied to 32 countries of Human\nMortality Database and years 1960--2010. The results show that the evolutions\nof developed countries follow the same pattern (with different timing): (1) a\nreduction of infant mortality, (2) an increase of premature mortality, (3) a\nshift and compression of deaths. Some countries are following this scheme and\nrecovering the gap with precursors, others do not show signs of recovery.\nEastern Europe countries are still at stage (2) and it is not clear if and when\nthey will enter into phase (3). All the country differences relates the\ndifferent timing with which countries undergo the stages identified by\nclusters. The cluster analysis based on FDA allows therefore a comprehensive\nunderstanding of the patterns of mortality decline for considered countries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Mar 2020 13:13:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-16"}

We\nprove stability of our method in the general nonlinear case and provide optimal\nerror estimates for linear PDEs for the solution itself as well as for the\nauxiliary variables approximating its derivatives. A key ingredient in the\nproof of the error estimates is the construction of the relationship between\nthe derivative and the element interface jump of the numerical solution and the\nauxiliary variable solution of the solution derivative. With this relationship,\nwe can then use the discrete Sobolev and Poincar\\'{e} inequalities to obtain\nthe optimal error estimates. The theoretical findings are confirmed by\nnumerical experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Mar 2020 13:35:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-13"}

Using\nconformal transforms, we generate families of symmetrical solutions from simple\nones, and provide a general methodology that can be used to analyze any\narrangement of source and sinks. The solutions obtained that contain the\nexplicit dependence on the various parameters of the problems, such as Pe, the\nspacing of the apertures and their relative injection and aspiration rates. In\nparticular, we show that the high Pe models can model problems with Pe as low\nas 1 with a maximum error committed of under $10\\%$, and that this error\ndecreases approximately as $Pe^{-1.5}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Mar 2020 14:32:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-13"}

Simulations concisely show the high precision, efficiency, and\nstability of the proposed localization method. Real-world experiments are\nconducted on a team of 5 Crazyflie2 quadrotors, demonstrating autonomous\nformation flight and coordinated flight through a window. All results indicate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed relative positioning method for multi-robot\nsystems.

Physically based numerical models can often\nprovide physically coherent spatial patterns, but may miss some important\nprecipitation features like heavy rainfall intensities. Measurements at\nground-based weather stations, however, supply adequate rainfall intensities,\nbut most national weather recording networks are often spatially too sparse to\ncapture rainfall patterns adequately. To bring the best out of these two\nsources of information, climatologists and hydrologists have been seeking\nmodels that can efficiently merge different types of rainfall data. One\ninherent difficulty is to capture the appropriate multivariate dependence\nstructure among rainfall maxima. For this purpose, multivariate extreme value\ntheory suggests the use of a max-stable process. Such a process can be\nrepresented by a max-linear combination of independent copies of a hidden\nstochastic process weighted by a Poisson point process. In practice, the choice\nof this hidden process is non-trivial, especially if anisotropy,\nnon-stationarity and nugget effects are present in the spatial data at hand. By\ncoupling forecast ensemble data from the French national weather service\n(M\\'et\\'eo-France) with local observations, we construct and compare different\ntypes of data driven max-stable processes that are parsimonious in parameters,\neasy to simulate and capable of reproducing nugget effects and spatial\nnon-stationarities.

As the considered\nrotation scheme is intended to work in conjunction with receiver-side carrier\nphase estimation (CPE), the model is modified to further assume that imperfect\nCPE has taken place, leaving residual phase noise in the processed signal.\nBased on this model, two receiver structures are derived and used to\nnumerically optimize transmitter-side signal rotations through Monte Carlo\nsimulations.

Prior arts\nusually focus on preserving the character of a clothing image (e.g. texture,\nlogo, embroidery) when warping it to arbitrary human pose. However, it remains\na big challenge to generate photo-realistic try-on images when large occlusions\nand human poses are presented in the reference person. To address this issue,\nwe propose a novel visual try-on network, namely Adaptive Content Generating\nand Preserving Network (ACGPN). In particular, ACGPN first predicts semantic\nlayout of the reference image that will be changed after try-on (e.g. long\nsleeve shirt$\\rightarrow$arm, arm$\\rightarrow$jacket), and then determines\nwhether its image content needs to be generated or preserved according to the\npredicted semantic layout, leading to photo-realistic try-on and rich clothing\ndetails. ACGPN generally involves three major modules. First, a semantic layout\ngeneration module utilizes semantic segmentation of the reference image to\nprogressively predict the desired semantic layout after try-on. Second, a\nclothes warping module warps clothing images according to the generated\nsemantic layout, where a second-order difference constraint is introduced to\nstabilize the warping process during training. Third, an inpainting module for\ncontent fusion integrates all information (e.g. reference image, semantic\nlayout, warped clothes) to adaptively produce each semantic part of human body.\nIn comparison to the state-of-the-art methods, ACGPN can generate\nphoto-realistic images with much better perceptual quality and richer\nfine-details.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Mar 2020 15:55:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-13"}

However, it is quite\ncommon for an event to have disjunctive causes in that it can be enabled by any\none of multiple sets of causes. Sometimes the sets of causes may be mutually\nexclusive, inconsistent one with another, and sometimes not, in which case they\ncoexist consistently and constitute parallel causes of the event. The\nestablished model of general event structures can model parallel causes. On\noccasion however such a model abstracts too far away from the precise causal\nhistories of events to be directly useful. For example, sometimes one needs to\nassociate probabilities with different, possibly coexisting, causal histories\nof a common event. Ideally, the causal histories of a general event structure\nwould correspond to the configurations of its causal unfolding to a prime event\nstructure; and the causal unfolding would arise as a right adjoint to the\nembedding of prime in general event structures. But there is no such\nadjunction. However, a slight extension of prime event structures remedies this\ndefect and provides a causal unfolding as a universal construction. Prime event\nstructures are extended with an equivalence relation in order to dissociate the\ntwo roles, that of an event and its enabling; in effect, prime causes are\nlabelled by a disjunctive event, an equivalence class of its prime causes. With\nthis enrichment a suitable causal unfolding appears as a pseudo right adjoint.\nThe adjunction relies critically on the central and subtle notion of extremal\ncausal realisation as an embodiment of causal history. Finally, we explore\nsubcategories which support parallel causes as well the key operations needed\nin developing probabilistic distributed strategies with parallel causes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Mar 2020 10:30:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Jan 2023 10:07:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 7 Mar 2023 16:29:36 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 19 Apr 2023 14:20:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-20"}

Knowledge of the normal component of the E\nfield on the conductor surface makes it possible to calculate the induced\nelectric charge surface density.

Calculation shows that the field\nemission intensity is very sensitive to a collimator surface roughness. In\naddition, with a relatively small and accidental beam displacement from the\nmedian path, about 20% of the collimator half-gap, the emission intensity\nincreases by a factor of 1.E+7.

The crest settlement of the embankment was\nselected as the quantifiable damage variable of the study. Fragility functions\nwere drawn to give the probability exceedance of some proposed damage levels as\nfunction of a seismic severity parameter. In addition, the anisotropy was\ntested by the change in the soil permeability and a comparison with the\nisotropy was held. According to the results, the crest settlement increases\nwith the peak ground acceleration and the fragility functions showed that above\n0.2g, the probability to have moderate damage in the anisotropic case reaches\nunity whereas it is lesser in the isotropic case. The embankment will not show\nserious damage for this same value of acceleration in the two cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Mar 2020 13:26:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-23"}

Recently, generative adversarial models have been\napplied extensively on text generation tasks, where the adversarially trained\ngenerators alleviate the exposure bias experienced by conventional maximum\nlikelihood approaches and result in promising generation quality. However, due\nto the notorious defect of mode collapse for adversarial training, the\nadversarially trained generators face a quality-diversity trade-off, i.e., the\ngenerator models tend to sacrifice generation diversity severely for increasing\ngeneration quality. In this paper, we propose a novel approach which aims to\nimprove the performance of adversarial text generation via efficiently\ndecelerating mode collapse of the adversarial training. To this end, we\nintroduce a cooperative training paradigm, where a language model is\ncooperatively trained with the generator and we utilize the language model to\nefficiently shape the data distribution of the generator against mode collapse.\nMoreover, instead of engaging the cooperative update for the generator in a\nprincipled way, we formulate a meta learning mechanism, where the cooperative\nupdate to the generator serves as a high level meta task, with an intuition of\nensuring the parameters of the generator after the adversarial update would\nstay resistant against mode collapse. In the experiment, we demonstrate our\nproposed approach can efficiently slow down the pace of mode collapse for the\nadversarial text generators. Overall, our proposed method is able to outperform\nthe baseline approaches with significant margins in terms of both generation\nquality and diversity in the testified domains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 12 Mar 2020 04:47:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-26"}

In a bilateral\ncommunication, the acceptable round trip latency is usually in the order of 1ms\nup to 10ms depending on the application requirements. It is estimated that 70%\nof the total latency is generated by the communication network, and the\nremaining 30% is produced by master and slave devices. Thus, this paper aims to\npropose a strategy to reduce 30% of the total latency that is produced by such\ndevices.

The\n5G-ALLSTAR project proposes to develop Multi-Connectivity (MC) solutions in\norder to guarantee network reliability and improve the throughput and latency\nfor each connection between User Equipment (UE) and network. In the 5G-ALLSTAR\nvision, we divide the gNB in two entities: 1) gNB-CU (Centralized Unit) and 2)\ngNB-DU (Distributed Unit) The gNB-CU integrates an innovative Traffic Flow\nControl algorithm able to optimize the network resources by coordinating the\ncontrolled gNB-DUs resources, while implementing MC solutions.

A stable two-dimensional vortex is formed in the core after a\nzero-field relaxation of an initial random or poly-domain distribution of the\npolarization, where the vortex axis is directed along one of the core\ncrystallographic axes. Subsequently, sinusoidal pulses of a homogeneous\nelectric field with variable period, strength, and direction are applied. The\nfield-induced changes of the vortex structure consist in the appearance of an\naxial kernel in the form of a prolate nanodomain, the kernel growth, an\nincreasing orientation of the polarization along the field, and the onset of a\nsingle-domain state. We introduced the term \"kernel\" to name the prolate\nnanodomain developed near the vortex axis and polarized perpendicular to the\nvortex plane. In ferromagnetism, this region is generally known as the vortex\ncore. The vortex states with a kernel possess a manifold degeneracy, appearing\nfrom three equiprobable directions of vortex axis, clockwise and\ncounterclockwise directions of polarization rotation along the vortex axis, and\ntwo polarization directions in the kernel.
