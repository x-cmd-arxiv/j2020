But such\ncomparisons face a challenge: Whereas machine perception of some stimulus can\noften be probed through direct and explicit measures, much of human perceptual\nknowledge is latent, incomplete, or unavailable for explicit report. Here, we\nexplore how this asymmetry can cause such comparisons to misestimate the\noverlap in human and machine perception. As a case study, we consider human\nperception of \\textit{adversarial speech} -- synthetic audio commands that are\nrecognized as valid messages by automated speech-recognition systems but that\nhuman listeners reportedly hear as meaningless noise. In five experiments, we\nadapt task designs from the human psychophysics literature to show that even\nwhen subjects cannot freely transcribe such speech commands (the previous\nbenchmark for human understanding), they often can demonstrate other forms of\nunderstanding, including discriminating adversarial speech from closely matched\nnon-speech (Experiments 1--2), finishing common phrases begun in adversarial\nspeech (Experiments 3--4), and solving simple math problems posed in\nadversarial speech (Experiment 5) -- even for stimuli previously described as\nunintelligible to human listeners. We recommend the adoption of such \"sensitive\ntests\" when comparing human and machine perception, and we discuss the broader\nconsequences of such approaches for assessing the overlap between systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Mar 2020 16:24:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Aug 2022 01:55:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-04"}

Existing methods fit a probability\ndistribution to the training samples on their embedding space and detect\noutliers according to this distribution. The embedding space is often obtained\nfrom a discriminative classifier. However, such discriminative representation\nfocuses only on known classes, which may not be critical for distinguishing the\nunknown classes. We argue that the representation space should be jointly\nlearned from the inlier classifier and the density estimator (served as an\noutlier detector). We propose the OpenHybrid framework, which is composed of an\nencoder to encode the input data into a joint embedding space, a classifier to\nclassify samples to inlier classes, and a flow-based density estimator to\ndetect whether a sample belongs to the unknown category. A typical problem of\nexisting flow-based models is that they may assign a higher likelihood to\noutliers.

We show that particle winds and fallback accretion can\npotentially lead to a sub-set of the magnetar population with ultra long\nperiods, sufficiently long to accommodate FRB 180916 or 1E 161348--5055.

We search for possible triggers that lead to\nthe eruption of the filament.\n  The surface velocity field in the region of the filament were measured by\nmeans of time-distance helioseismology and coherent structure tracking. The\napparent velocities in the higher atmosphere were estimated by tracking the\nfeatures in the 30.4 nm AIA observations. To capture the evolution of the\nmagnetic field, we extrapolated the photospheric line-of-sight magnetograms and\nalso computed the decay index of the magnetic field.\n  We found that photospheric velocity fields showed some peculiarities. Before\nthe filament activation, we observed a temporal increase of the converging\nflows towards the filament's spine. In addition, the mean squared velocity\nincreased temporarily before the activation and peaked just before it, followed\nby a steep decrease. We further see an increase in the average shear of the\nzonal flow component in the filament's region, followed by a steep decrease.\nThe photospheric l.o.s. magnetic field shows a persistent increase of induction\neastward from the filament spine. The decay index of the magnetic field at\nheights around 10 Mm shows a value larger than critical at the connecting point\nof the northern filament end.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Mar 2020 16:27:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-29"}

It is a very challenging task present in many\nreal-world applications, such as classification of biology, image, video,\naudio, and text. Recently, the interest in interpretable classification models\nhas grown, partially as a consequence of regulations such as the General Data\nProtection Regulation. In this context, we propose a multi-objective\nevolutionary algorithm that generates multiple rule-based multi-label\nclassification models, allowing users to choose among models that offer\ndifferent compromises between predictive power and interpretability. An\nimportant contribution of this work is that different from most algorithms,\nwhich usually generate models based on lists (ordered collections) of rules,\nour algorithm generates models based on sets (unordered collections) of rules,\nincreasing interpretability. Also, by employing a conflict avoidance algorithm\nduring the rule-creation, every rule within a given model is guaranteed to be\nconsistent with every other rule in the same model. Thus, no conflict\nresolution strategy is required, evolving simpler models. We conducted\nexperiments on synthetic and real-world datasets and compared our results with\nstate-of-the-art algorithms in terms of predictive performance (F-Score) and\ninterpretability (model size), and demonstrate that our best models had\ncomparable F-Score and smaller model sizes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Mar 2020 16:43:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-03"}

Here, we utilize a\nrecently developed $T$-matrix approach to incorporate NP effects for gluon\nemission off heavy quarks propagating through the QGP. We set up four cases\nthat contain, starting from a Born diagram calculation with color-Coulomb\ninteraction, an increasing level of NP components, by subsequently including\n(remnants of) confining interactions, resummation in the heavy-light scattering\namplitude, and off-shell spectral functions for both heavy and light partons.\nFor each case we compute the power spectra of the emitted gluons, heavy-quark\ntransport coefficients (drag and transverse-momentum broadening, $\\hat{q}$),\nand the path-length dependent energy loss within a \"QGP brick\" at fixed\ntemperature. Investigating the differences in these quantities between the four\ncases illustrates how NP mechanisms affect gluon radiation processes. While the\nbaseline perturbative processes experience a strong suppression of soft\nradiation due to thermal masses of the emitted gluons, confining interactions,\nladder resummations and broad spectral functions (re-)generate a large\nenhancement toward low momenta and low temperatures. For example, for a 10 GeV\ncharm quark at 200 MeV temperature, they enhance the transport coefficients by\nup to a factor of 10, while the results smoothly converge to perturbative\nresults at sufficiently hard scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Mar 2020 17:02:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-30"}

The aim of the present paper is to\ndescribe a general estimation strategy that allows to adapt to both the\nspecific features of the model and the choice of the loss function in view of\ndesigning an estimator with good estimation properties. The losses we have in\nmind are based on the total variation, Hellinger, Wasserstein and\n$\\mathbb{L}_p$-distances to name a few.

It is\ndifficult for conventional NAS algorithms to directly search the architectures\non large-scale tasks like ImageNet. In general, the cost of GPU hours for NAS\ngrows with regard to training dataset size and candidate set size. One common\nway is searching on a smaller proxy dataset (e.g., CIFAR-10) and then\ntransferring to the target task (e.g., ImageNet). These architectures optimized\non proxy data are not guaranteed to be optimal on the target task. Another\ncommon way is learning with a smaller candidate set, which may require expert\nknowledge and indeed betrays the essence of NAS. In this paper, we present\nDA-NAS that can directly search the architecture for large-scale target tasks\nwhile allowing a large candidate set in a more efficient manner.

The search algorithm, defined by local vacuum transitions, is\noptimal in regions of the landscape where the dynamics are tuned at\ncriticality, with de Sitter vacua having an average lifetime of order their\nPage time. The purpose of this paper is to shed light on the nature of the\ndynamical phase transition at the Page lifetime. We focus on a finite region of\nthe landscape, which exchanges volume with the rest of the landscape and as\nsuch acts as an open system. Through a change of variables the master equation\ngoverning the comoving volume of de Sitter vacua is mapped to a stochastic\nequation for coupled overdamped stochastic oscillators -- the well-known\nOrnstein-Uhlenbeck process. The rest of the landscape, which acts as an\nenvironment, is assumed to result in a non-vanishing driving term for all sites\nin the region with uncorrelated, white noise fluctuations (though not\nnecessarily Gaussian). We first show that the static susceptibility of the\noscillators diverges as the average lifetime of de Sitter vacua approaches the\nPage time. Thus, optimal regions of the landscape are most susceptible to\nvolume influx from their environing landscape. We then show that the\ndisplacement fluctuations for the oscillators exhibit a $1/f$ power spectrum\nover a broad range of frequencies, precisely at the critical Page lifetime\ndistribution. A $1/f$ power spectrum is a hallmark of non-equilibrium systems\nat criticality. In analogy with sand avalanches in the abelian sandpile or\nneuronal avalanches in the brain, de Sitter vacua at criticality can be thought\nof as undergoing scale invariant volume fluctuation avalanches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Mar 2020 18:39:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 May 2021 18:28:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-11"}

Assuming that each agent's localization error follows a Gaussian\ndistribution, we study the problem of forming a reliable communication link\nbetween the agents and the base station despite the localization errors. In\nparticular, we formulate a discrete optimization problem to choose only a\nsubset of agents to transmit the message signal so that the variance of the\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) received by the base station is minimized while the\nexpected SNR exceeds a desired threshold. When the variances of the\nlocalization errors are below a certain threshold characterized in terms of the\ncarrier frequency, we show that greedy algorithms can be used to globally\nminimize the variance of the received SNR.

However, solely relying on the\nvisible spectrum has previously led to reliability issues in low contrast\nscenarios such as sUAS flying below the treeline and against bright sources of\nlight. Alternatively, due to the relatively high heat signatures emitted from\nsUAS during flight, a long-wave infrared (LWIR) sensor is able to produce\nimages that clearly contrast the sUAS from its background. However, compared to\nwidely available visible spectrum sensors, LWIR sensors have lower resolution\nand may produce more false positives when exposed to birds or other heat\nsources. This research work proposes combining the advantages of the LWIR and\nvisible spectrum sensors using machine learning for vision-based detection of\nsUAS. Utilizing the heightened background contrast from the LWIR sensor\ncombined and synchronized with the relatively increased resolution of the\nvisible spectrum sensor, a deep learning model was trained to detect the sUAS\nthrough previously difficult environments. More specifically, the approach\ndemonstrated effective detection of multiple sUAS flying above and below the\ntreeline, in the presence of heat sources, and glare from the sun.

The alignment of cells is caused by anisotropic swelling of\nthe substrates in contact with the aqueous cell growth medium. The patterns\npredesigned in the LCE cause a strong spatial variation of cell phenotype\n(evidenced by shape variations), their surface density and number density\nfluctuations. The concentration of cells is significantly higher near the cores\nof positive-strength defects as compared to negative-strength defects.\nUnbinding of defect pairs intrinsic to active matter is suppressed by\nanisotropic surface anchoring. The geometry of arrays allows one to estimate\nthe elastic and surface anchoring characteristics of the tissues.

The polarized proton is considered in the quark-diquark model while\nits interaction with the unpolarized target is calculated using the\nsmall-$x$/saturation approach, which includes multiple rescatterings and\nsmall-$x$ evolution. The phase required for the asymmetry is caused by a\nfinal-state gluon exchange between the quark and diquark, as is standard in the\nlensing mechanism of Brodsky, Hwang and Schmidt. Our calculation combines the\nlensing mechanism with small-$x$ physics in the saturation framework. The\nexpression we obtain for the asymmetry $A_N$ of the produced quarks has the\nfollowing properties: (i) The asymmetry is generated by the dominant elastic\nscattering contribution and $1/N_c^2$ suppressed inelastic contribution (with\n$N_c$ the number of quark colors); (ii) The asymmetry grows or oscillates with\nthe produced quark's transverse momentum $p_T$ until the momentum reaches the\nsaturation scale $Q_s$, and then only falls off as $1/p_T$ for larger momenta;\n(iii) The asymmetry decreases with increasing atomic number $A$ of the target\nfor $p_T$ below or near $Q_s$, but is independent of $A$ for $p_T$\nsignificantly above $Q_s$.

While the linear\nspin wave theory(LSWT) predicts three branches of magnon mode in the magnetic\nBrillouin zone(MBZ), the 1/S expansion at the next order is found to break down\nin a large portion of the MBZ centered around the M point, leaving the fate of\nthe magnon modes there undecided. Recent neutron scattering measurement on\nBa$_3$CoSb$_2$O$_9$, an ideal realization of the spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ TLHAF,\nprovides a surprising answer to this issue. Two, rather than three branches of\nmagnon mode are observed around the M point, whose dispersion are strongly\nrenormalized with respect to the LSWT prediction and exhibit pronounced\nroton-like minimum at the M point. This is accompanied by a strong spin\nfluctuation continuum at higher energy, inside which two strong and broad\nspectral peaks of unknown origin are observed. In this work, we propose a\nsimple picture for these spectral anomalies by invoking the resonating valence\nbond(RVB) physics in the description of the ground state of the system. We find\nthat the roton-like minimum in the magnon dispersion can be explained by the\ncoupling between the collective spin fluctuation and the continuum of Dirac\nspinon excitation moving in a $\\pi$-flux background. We also propose that the\ntwo broad peaks in the continuum can be understood respectively as the Landau\ndamped third magnon mode and the Landau damped longitudinal mode.

The electroencephalogram(EEG) is the most widely used method to record\nbrain signals and diagnose epilepsy and seizure cases. In this paper we use the\nmethod of Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) in our analysis to classify\nseizure/seizure free signals. This technique uses variational non recursive\nmode decomposition, in comparison to other methods like Empirical Mode (EMD)\nand Hilbert-Huang transform which recursively decompose the signals, making\nthem more susceptible to noise and sampling rate. VMD decomposes a signal into\nits components which are called principal modes. In our analysis, 4 features of\nthe decomposed signals namely Renyi Entropy, second order difference plot\n(SODP), fourth order difference plot(FODP) and average amplitude are\ninvestigated, both individually and using a ranking methodology considering all\n4 features at the same time. The SODP of decomposed signal modes is an\nelliptical structure. The 95% confidence ellipse area measured from the SODP of\nthe decomposed signal modes has been used as a feature in order to discriminate\nseizure-free EEG signals from the epileptic seizure EEG signal. For the\nclassification, a Multilayer Perceptron(MLP) with back propagation algorithm as\nthe training method was used. A high percentage of accuracy was obtained when\nthe features were used individually for classification and an even higher\ndegree of accuracy was obtained when the ranking methodology was used.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Mar 2020 03:16:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-31"}

During this early stage, the evolution of the two simulations is\nvery similar (implying that the feedback from low mass stars does not affect\nthe cloud-scale evolution significantly) and the star-forming region accretes\nfaster than it can convert gas to stars, causing the instantaneous measured\nstar formation efficiency (SFE) to remain low even in the absence of\nsignificant feedback. Afterwards, the ionising feedback first destroys the\nfilamentary supply to star-forming hubs and ultimately removes the gas from it,\nthus first reducing the star formation (SF) and finally halting it. The\nionising feedback also affects the initial kinematics and spatial distribution\nof the forming stars, because the gas being dispersed continues to form stars,\nwhich inherit its motion. In the non-feedback simulation, the groups remain\nhighly compact and do not mix, while in the run with feedback, the gas\ndispersal causes each group to expand, and the cluster expansion thus consists\nof the combined expansion of the groups.

One of the major challenges is that the potential popularity\nof a micro-video tends to fluctuate under the impact of various external\nfactors, which makes it full of uncertainties. In addition, since micro-videos\nare mainly uploaded by individuals that lack professional techniques, multiple\ntypes of noise could exist that obscure useful information. In this paper, we\npropose a multimodal variational encoder-decoder (MMVED) framework for\nmicro-video popularity prediction tasks. MMVED learns a stochastic Gaussian\nembedding of a micro-video that is informative to its popularity level while\npreserves the inherent uncertainties simultaneously.

Furthermore, the Bayesian product-of-experts principle is applied to\nthe multimodal encoder, where the decision for information keeping or\ndiscarding is made comprehensively with all available modalities.

The results suggest that the\ninitial growth/spreading rate gamma-c of the disease, and the fraction of\ninfected persons in the population p-i can be used to define a\n`retardation/inhibition coefficient' k-star , which is a measure of the\neffectiveness of the control policies adopted.\n  The results are obtained analytically and numerically using a simple Python\ncode.

Topological\nvalley-polarized electrons confined to domain walls in bilayer graphene were\nextensively studied in view of their potentials in valleytronics. Here, we\nstudy the magnonic version of domain wall excitations in 2D honeycomb\nferromagnetic bilayers (FBL) with collinear order. In particular, we explore\nthe implications of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) and electrostatic\ndoping (ED) on the existence and characteristics of 1D magnons confined to\nlayer stacking domain walls in FBL. The coexistence of DMI and ED is found to\nenrich the topology in FBL, yet the corresponding domain wall magnons do not\ncarry a well-defined valley index. On the other hand, we show that layer\nstacking domain walls in DMI-free FBL constitute 1D channels for ballistic\ntransport of topological valley-polarized magnons.

This study focuses on the development of one of these\nevacuation strategies for Manhattan Island.

In this article a hydrological model\nfor optimized operation of the Kamuzu Barrage called the Kamuzu Barrage\nOperation Model (KABOM) is presented. This model is a tool for water resource\nmanagement at the Kamuzu Barrage based on stochastic hydrology. The stochastic\nmodel uses water level readings at Lake Malawi and at the Shire River near\nLiwonde stretching from January 1900 to date. By using historical rating curves\nat Liwonde, and developing an updated post-2003 flood rating curve, the model\ncan calculate flow at Liwonde for the entire period. The model simulates\navailable water budgets for a range of probabilities based on the Lake Level\nand flow record over the past 115 years, plus available data on local inflows\nto the Shire River from its tributaries. The results provide a basis for\nchoosing a release strategy in Kamuzu Barrage, which is used in optimizing the\nrelease at the barrage on daily basis. Resulting quantiles display a strong\nseasonal variation, highest Freewater forecasts within February and March in\nthe rainy season, and the lowest months of June and July in dry season. The\nresults for simulation are controlled against actual Freewater values in the\nperiod of December 2016 to October 2017, which demonstrates a satisfactory\nvalidation\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Mar 2020 15:18:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-03"}

Especially in the area of commercial\nbuildings, only few articles take a user-centric perspective and none of them\nconsiders the subjectivity of thermal comfort. This work addresses this\nresearch gap and aims to optimize individual environmental comfort in open\noffice environments, taking advantage of changes in modern office\ninfrastructure and considering actual user feedback without interfering with\nexisting systems. Based on a Design Science Research approach, we first perform\na user experience testing in an exemplary corporate office building.\nFurthermore, we build a mechanism to gather user feedback on environmental\ncomfort. Based on this, we build a machine learning model including different\nIoT data sources (e.g. building data and weather data) with an average\ncoefficient of determination of 41.5%. Using these insights, we are able to\nsuggest current individual comfort zones within the building and help employees\nto make better informed decisions on where to sit or what to wear, to feel\ncomfortable and work productively. Therefore, we contribute to the body of\nknowledge by proposing a user-centric design within a cross-disciplinary\ncontext on the basis of analytical processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Mar 2020 19:06:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-08"}
