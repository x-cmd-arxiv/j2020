One possibility to address this issue is\nthe use of orthogonal multiple access (OMA) techniques. However, due to a\npotentially very long duty cycle, OMA is not well suited for such schemes.\nInstead, random medium access (RMA) appears more promising. An RMA scheme is\nbased on transmission of short data packets with random scheduling, which is\ntypically unknown to the receiver. The received signal, which consists of the\noverlapping packets, can be used for energy harvesting and powering of a relay\ndevice.

On spatial scales much larger than the\nbilayer thickness, the membrane elasticity is well determined by its shape and\nadequately described by the classical Helfrich Hamiltonian. However, various\nlocal membrane heterogeneities can result in a lipids tilt relative to the\nmembrane surface normal. On the basis of the classical elasticity theory of 3D\nbodies, Hamm and Kozlov [Eur. Phys. J. E 3, 323 (2000)] derived the most\ngeneral energy functional, taking into account the tilt and bending. Recently,\nTerzi and Deserno [J. Chem. Phys. 147, 084702 (2017)] showed that Hamm and\nKozlov's derivation was incomplete because the tilt-curvature coupling term had\nbeen missed. However, the energy functional derived by Terzi and Deserno\nappeared to be unstable, thereby being invalid for applications. Here, we\nderive a stable elastic energy functional, showing that the squared gradient of\nthe curvature was missed in both of these works. This change in the energy\nfunctional arises from a more accurate consideration of the transverse shear\ndeformation terms and their influence on the membrane stability.

Such externalities couple firms' optimal\nallocations, despite the inherent free replicability of data. In this paper, we\ndemonstrate that the presence of externalities increases the optimal revenue of\na monopolistic data seller by letting firms pay to prevent allocations to other\ncompeting firms.

Our model is\ntrained without any ground truth 3D data and only requires a held-out\nperspective view near the input stereo pair and a spherical panorama taken\nwithin each scene as supervision, as opposed to prior methods for\nspatially-varying lighting estimation, which require ground truth scene\ngeometry for training. We demonstrate that our method can predict consistent\nspatially-varying lighting that is convincing enough to plausibly relight and\ninsert highly specular virtual objects into real images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Mar 2020 17:46:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 May 2020 17:04:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-14"}

We study the problem of learning localization model on\ntarget classes with weakly supervised image labels, helped by a fully annotated\nsource dataset. Typically, a WSOL model is first trained to predict class\ngeneric objectness scores on an off-the-shelf fully supervised source dataset\nand then it is progressively adapted to learn the objects in the weakly\nsupervised target dataset.

For example, self-driving vehicles and robotic manipulation\nsystems often forecast future object poses by first detecting and tracking\nobjects. However, this detect-then-forecast pipeline is expensive to scale, as\npose forecasting algorithms typically require labeled sequences of object\nposes, which are costly to obtain in 3D space. Can we scale performance without\nrequiring additional labels? We hypothesize yes, and propose inverting the\ndetect-then-forecast pipeline. Instead of detecting, tracking and then\nforecasting the objects, we propose to first forecast 3D sensor data (e.g.,\npoint clouds with $100$k points) and then detect/track objects on the predicted\npoint cloud sequences to obtain future poses, i.e., a forecast-then-detect\npipeline. This inversion makes it less expensive to scale pose forecasting, as\nthe sensor data forecasting task requires no labels.

While much care has been taken into designing and learning deep\ngenerative models, how to efficiently produce diverse samples from a deep\ngenerative model after it has been trained is still an under-explored problem.\nTo obtain samples from a pretrained generative model, most existing generative\nhuman motion prediction methods draw a set of independent Gaussian latent codes\nand convert them to motion samples. Clearly, this random sampling strategy is\nnot guaranteed to produce diverse samples for two reasons: (1) The independent\nsampling cannot force the samples to be diverse; (2) The sampling is based\nsolely on likelihood which may only produce samples that correspond to the\nmajor modes of the data distribution. To address these problems, we propose a\nnovel sampling method, Diversifying Latent Flows (DLow), to produce a diverse\nset of samples from a pretrained deep generative model. Unlike random\n(independent) sampling, the proposed DLow sampling method samples a single\nrandom variable and then maps it with a set of learnable mapping functions to a\nset of correlated latent codes. The correlated latent codes are then decoded\ninto a set of correlated samples. During training, DLow uses a\ndiversity-promoting prior over samples as an objective to optimize the latent\nmappings to improve sample diversity. The design of the prior is highly\nflexible and can be customized to generate diverse motions with common features\n(e.g., similar leg motion but diverse upper-body motion). Our experiments\ndemonstrate that DLow outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods in terms of\nsample diversity and accuracy.

We find\nthat with the flexibility of SLES present, variable renewables such as offshore\nwind can displace firm but more expensive low-carbon sources such as CCS.\nConsidering a 100 gCO2/kWh emissions target in 2030, a 10% penetration of SLES\ncould reduce total costs by {\\pounds}1.2bn/year relative to no SLES, while at\nhigher penetration of 50% SLES, savings increase twofold to\n{\\pounds}2.8bn/year.

Kelvin-Helmholtz instability creates a\nturbulent mixing layer and populates the intermediate-temperature phase, which\noften cools rapidly. The energy lost to cooling is balanced by the advection of\nhot high enthalpy gas into the mixing layer, resulting in growth and\nacceleration of the cold phase. This process may play a major role in\ndetermining the interstellar medium and circumgalactic medium phase structure,\nand accelerating cold gas in galactic winds and cosmic filaments. Cooling in\nthese mixing layers occurs in a thin corrugated sheet, which we argue has an\narea with fractal dimension $D=5/2$ and a thickness that adjusts to match the\nhot phase mixing time to the cooling time.

It allows quantification of the\ncardiac chambers without any geometric assumptions, which is the main weakness\nof 2D echocardiography. However, regional quantification of geometry and\nfunction is limited by the lower spatial and temporal resolution and the\nscarcity of identifiable anatomical landmarks. We developed a technique for\nregionally assessing the 3 relevant RV regions: apical, inlet and outflow. The\nmethod's inputs are end-diastolic (ED) and end-systolic (ES) segmented 3D\nsurface models. The method first defines a partition of the ED endocardium\nusing the geodesic distances from each surface point to apex, tricuspid valve\nand pulmonary valve: the landmarks that define the 3 regions. The ED surface\nmesh is then tetrahedralised, and the endocardial-defined partition is\ninterpolated in the blood cavity via the Laplace equation. For obtaining an ES\npartition, the endocardial partition is transported from ED to ES using a\ncommercial image-based tracking, and then interpolated towards the endocardium,\nsimilarly to ED, for computing volumes and ejection fraction (EF). We present a\nfull assessment of the method's validity and reproducibility. First, we assess\nreproducibility under segmentation variability, obtaining intra- and inter-\nobserver errors (4-10% and 10-23% resp.).

Contrary to these\nexpectations, we find that the radii of Kepler planets (a proxy for mass) are\nindependent of host metallicity. Previous claims that larger planets prefer\nmore metal-rich stars can be adequately explained by the combined facts that\nmore massive stars tend to host bigger planets, and that more massive stars are\nalso more metal rich in the Kepler sample. We interpret this independence as\nthat the mass of a Kepler planet is not determined by the availability of\nsolids, but is instead regulated by an as yet unknown process. Moreover, we\nfind that the occurrence rates of Kepler planets rise only weakly with stellar\nmetallicity, a trend that is further flattened when the influence of close\nstellar binaries is accounted for. We explain this weak dependence, in contrast\nto the strong dependence exhibited by Jovian planets, using a phenomenological\nmodel, wherein the masses of proto-planetary disks have a much larger spread\nthan the spread in stellar metallicity, and wherein the formation of Jovian\nplanets requires disks that contain some $5$ times more solid than that needed\nto form Kepler planets.

In this study, we consider the use of\nactive flow control with steady blowing to increase the pressure distribution\nwithin a single-phase pump-induced wall-normal vortex model, which is based on\nthe Burgers vortex with a no-slip boundary condition prescribed along its\nsymmetry plane. The goal of our control is to modify the vortex core velocity\nprofile. These changes are sought to increase the core pressure such that\ndetrimental effects on the pump are alleviated. Three-dimensional direct\nnumerical simulations (DNS) are performed to examine the dynamics of the vortex\nwith the application of axial momentum injection at and around the root of the\nvortex.

This provides a\ndramatic improvement on the work in Howett et al. (2011), where the values were\ndetermined at only two regions on Mimas (one inside, and another outside of the\nanomalous region). We use all spatially-resolved scans made by CIRS' focal\nplane 3 (FP3, 600 to 1100 cm-1) of Mimas' surface, which are largely daytime\nobservations but do include one nighttime one. The resulting temperature maps\nconfirm the presence and location of Mimas' previously discovered thermally\nanomalous region. No other thermally anomalous regions were discovered,\nalthough we note that the surface coverage is incomplete on Mimas' leading and\nanti-Saturn hemisphere. The thermal inertia map confirms that the anomalous\nregion has a notably higher thermal inertia than its surroundings: 98 +/- 42 J\nm-2 K-1 s-1/2 inside of the anomaly, compared to 34 +/- 32 J m-2 K-1 s-1/2\noutside. The albedo inside and outside of the anomalous region agrees within\ntheir uncertainty: 0.45+/-0.08 inside compared to 0.41 +/- 0.07 outside the\nanomaly. Interestingly the albedo appears brighter inside the anomaly region,\nwhich may not be surprising given this region does appear brighter at some UV\nwavelengths (0.338 microns, see Schenk et al., 2011). However, this result\nshould be treated with caution because, as previously stated, statistically the\nalbedo of these two regions is the same when their uncertainties are\nconsidered. These thermal inertia and albedo values determined here are\nconsistent with those found by Howett et al. (2011), who determined the thermal\ninertia inside the anomaly to be 66 +/- 23 J m-2 K-1 s-1/2 and less than 16 J\nm-2 K-1 s-1/2 outside, with albedos that varied from 0.49 to 0.70.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Mar 2020 19:35:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-20"}

Our method, Mutual Information-based\nNeuron Trimming (MINT), approaches deep compression via pruning by enforcing\nsparsity based on the strength of the relationship between filters of adjacent\nlayers, across every pair of layers. The relationship is calculated using\nconditional geometric mutual information which evaluates the amount of similar\ninformation exchanged between the filters using a graph-based criterion.

However, 360$^o$ video is associated with\nhigh bandwidth requirements. The required bandwidth can be reduced by\nexploiting the fact that users are interested in viewing only a part of the\nvideo scene and that users request viewports that overlap with each other.\nMotivated by the findings of recent works where the benefits of caching video\ntiles at edge servers instead of caching entire 360$^o$ videos were shown, in\nthis paper, we introduce the concept of virtual viewports that have the same\nnumber of tiles with the original viewports. The tiles forming these viewports\nare the most popular ones for each video and are determined by the users'\nrequests. Then, we propose a proactive caching scheme that assumes unknown\nvideos' and viewports' popularity. Our scheme determines which videos to cache\nas well as which is the optimal virtual viewport per video. Virtual viewports\npermit to lower the dimensionality of the cache optimization problem. To solve\nthe problem, we first formulate the content placement of 360$^o$ videos in edge\ncache networks as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and then we determine the\noptimal caching placement using the Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithm. The\nproposed solution aims at maximizing the overall quality of the 360$^o$ videos\ndelivered to the end-users by caching the most popular 360$^o$ videos at base\nquality along with a virtual viewport in high quality. We extensively evaluate\nthe performance of the proposed system and compare it with that of known\nsystems such as LFU, LRU, FIFO, over both synthetic and real 360$^o$ video\ntraces. The results reveal the large benefits coming from proactive caching of\nvirtual viewports instead of the original ones in terms of the overall quality\nof the rendered viewports, the cache hit ratio, and the servicing cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Mar 2020 21:05:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Apr 2020 18:22:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-14"}

Aims: We\ndetermine the inner slope of the DM density profile of a massive cluster of\ngalaxies, Abell S1063 (RXC J2248.7$-$4431) at $z=0.35$, with a dynamical\nanalysis based on an extensive spectroscopic campaign carried out with the\nVIMOS and MUSE spectrographs at the ESO VLT. This new data set provides an\nunprecedented sample of 1234 spectroscopic members, 104 of which are located in\nthe cluster core (R < 200 kpc), extracted from the MUSE integral field\nspectroscopy. The latter also allows the stellar velocity dispersion profile of\nthe brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) to be measured out to 40 kpc. Methods: We\nused an upgraded version of the MAMPOSSt technique to perform a joint maximum\nlikelihood fit to the velocity dispersion profile of the BCG and to the\nvelocity distribution of cluster member galaxies over a radial range from 1 kpc\nto the virial radius (~ 2.7 Mpc).

Our value of\n\\gamma_{DM} is in very good agreement with predictions from cosmological CDM\nsimulations. We will extend our analysis to more clusters in future works.

Our model, that we call SUDR+K, is based on usual SIR\nmodel, but it splits the total fraction of infected individuals into two\ncomponents: those that are undetected and those that are detected through\ntests. Moreover, we assume that available tests increase at a constant rate\nfrom the beginning of epidemics but are consumed to detect infected\nindividuals. Strikingly we find a bi-stable behavior between a phase with a\ngiant fraction of infected and a phase with a very small fraction. We show that\nthe separation between these two regimes is governed by a match between the\nrate of testing and a rate of infection spread at given time. We also show that\nthe existence of two phases does not depend on the mathematical choice of the\nform of the term describing the rate at which undetected individuals are tested\nand detected. Presented research implies that a vigorous early testing\nactivity, before the epidemics enters into its giant phase, can potentially\nkeep epidemics under control, and that even a very small change in rate of\ntesting can increase or decrease the size of the whole epidemics of various\norders of magnitude.

In a typical self-supervised learning\nscheme, the primary task is defined by the problem objective (e.g. clustering,\nclassification, embedding generation etc.) and the secondary task is defined by\nthe self-supervision objective (e.g. rotation prediction, words in\nneighborhood, colorization, etc.).

Our results show that highly efficient valley filtering\nwith maximum conductivity and polarization can be achieved by controlling the\nvalue of the magnetic field and the electric barrier width and height.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Mar 2020 22:11:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-02"}

Observation of neutrinoless double-beta decay would reveal that\nneutrinos are Majorana fermions and that lepton number conservation is violated\nin nature.

Also, prior work has analyzed mobility at the spatial scale\nof the underlying mobile dataset and has not analyzed mobility characteristics\nat different spatial scales and its implications on system design. In this\npaper, we empirically analyze the mobility of modern Internet users owning\nmultiple devices at multiple spatial scales using a large campus WiFi dataset.\nFirst, our results show that mobility of multiple devices belonging to a user\nneeds to be analyzed and modeled as a group, rather than independently, and\nthat there are substantial differences in the correlations exhibited by device\ntrajectories across users that also need to be considered. Second, our analysis\nshows that the mobility of users shows different characteristics at different\nspatial scales such as within and across buildings. Third, we demonstrate the\nimplications of these results by presenting generative models that highlight\nthe importance of considering the spatial scale of mobility as well as\nmulti-device mobility.

The underlying geometry is non-metric due to the $R_{[\\mu\\nu]}^2$\nterm acting as a gauge kinetic term for $v_\\mu$. We show that this theory has\nan elegant spontaneous breaking of gauged scale symmetry and mass generation in\nthe absence of matter, where the necessary scalar field ($\\phi$) is not added\nad-hoc to this purpose but is \"extracted\" from the $R^2$ term.

To render a classifier robust to pose\nvariations, most deep neural networks try to eliminate the influence of pose by\nusing large datasets with many poses for each class. Here, we propose a\ndifferent approach: a class-agnostic object pose transformation network\n(OPT-Net) can transform an image along 3D yaw and pitch axes to synthesize\nadditional poses continuously. Synthesized images lead to better training of an\nobject classifier. We design a novel eliminate-add structure to explicitly\ndisentangle pose from object identity: first eliminate pose information of the\ninput image and then add target pose information (regularized as continuous\nvariables) to synthesize any target pose. We trained OPT-Net on images of toy\nvehicles shot on a turntable from the iLab-20M dataset. After training on\nunbalanced discrete poses (5 classes with 6 poses per object instance, plus 5\nclasses with only 2 poses), we show that OPT-Net can synthesize balanced\ncontinuous new poses along yaw and pitch axes with high quality. Training a\nResNet-18 classifier with original plus synthesized poses improves mAP accuracy\nby 9% overtraining on original poses only.

We find that rotational disruption can have a large influence on the\nevolution of grain size distribution in the following two aspects especially\nfor composites and grain mantles (with tensile strength $\\sim 10^7$ erg\ncm$^{-3}$). First, because of the short time-scale of rotational disruption,\nthe small-grain production occurs even in the early phase of galaxy evolution.\nTherefore, even though stars produce large grains, the abundance of small\ngrains can be large enough to steepen the extinction curve. Secondly,\nrotational disruption is important in determining the maximum grain radius,\nwhich regulates the steepness of the extinction curve. For compact grains with\ntensile strength $\\gtrsim 10^9$ erg cm$^{-3}$, the size evolution is\nsignificantly affected by rotational disruption only if the radiation field is\nas strong as (or the dust temperature is as high as) expected for starburst\ngalaxies.

To solve those problems, in this paper, we propose a\nnew lifelong learning framework named Searchable Extension Units (SEU) by\nintroducing Neural Architecture Search into lifelong learning, which breaks\ndown the need for a predefined original model and searches for specific\nextension units for different tasks, without compromising the performance of\nthe model on different tasks.

GP regression is used to\nestablish the predictability of the local polarization field from different\ngroups of parameters, including the adjacent polarization values and several\ncombinations of physical and chemical descriptors, including lattice\nparameters, column intensities, etc. We observe that certain elements of\nmicrostructure including charged and uncharged domain walls and interfaces with\nthe substrate are best predicted with specific combinations of descriptors, and\nthis predictability and their associated uncertainties are consistent across\nthe composition series. The associated generative physical mechanisms are\ndiscussed. We argue that predictability and uncertainty in observational data\noffers a new pathway to probe the physics of condensed matter systems from\nmultimodal local observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Mar 2020 05:13:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 31 Jan 2021 03:36:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-02"}

Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) are able to\ncollaboratively plan and execute driving maneuvers by sharing their perceptual\nknowledge and future plans. In this paper, an architecture for autonomous\nnavigation of tight multi-lane platoons travelling on public roads is\npresented. Using the proposed approach, CAVs are able to form single or\nmulti-lane platoons of various geometrical configurations. They are able to\nreshape and adjust their configurations according to changes in the\nenvironment. The proposed architecture consists of two main components: an\noffline motion planner system and an online hierarchical control system. The\nmotion planner uses an optimization-based approach for cooperative formation\nand reconfiguration in tight spaces. A constrained optimization scheme is used\nto plan smooth, dynamically feasible and collision-free trajectories for all\nthe vehicles within the platoon. The paper addresses online computation\nlimitations by employing a family of maneuvers precomputed offline and stored\non a look-up table on the vehicles. The online hierarchical control system is\ncomposed of three levels: a traffic operation system (TOS), a decision-maker,\nand a path-follower. The TOS determines the desired platoon reconfiguration.\nThe decision-maker checks the feasibility of the reconfiguration plan. The\nreconfiguration maneuver is executed by a low-level path-following feedback\ncontroller in real-time. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated\nthrough simulations of three case studies: 1) formation reconfiguration 2)\nobstacle avoidance, and 3) benchmarking against behavior-based planning in\nwhich the desired formation is achieved using a sequence of motion primitives.\nVideos and software can be found online\nhttps://github.com/RoyaFiroozi/Centralized-Planning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Mar 2020 06:46:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Dec 2020 02:23:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-25"}

The problem of extracting event information from texts is\nlongstanding and usually relies on elaborately designed lexical and syntactic\nfeatures, which, however, take a large amount of human effort and lack\ngeneralization. More recently, deep neural network approaches have been adopted\nas a means to learn underlying features automatically.

Also, most approaches extract\neach argument of an event separately without considering associations between\narguments which ultimately leads to low efficiency, especially in sentences\nwith multiple events. To address the two above-referred problems, we propose a\nnovel joint event extraction framework that aims to extract multiple event\ntriggers and arguments simultaneously by introducing shortest dependency path\n(SDP) in the dependency graph. We do this by eliminating irrelevant words in\nthe sentence, thus capturing long-range dependencies.

This poses an additional challenge\nof domain adaptation (DA) with few training samples. In this paper, the problem\nof domain-adaptive few-shot learning (DA-FSL) is tackled, which requires\nsolving FSL and DA in a unified framework. To this end, we propose a novel\ndomain-adversarial prototypical network (DAPN) model. It is designed to address\na specific challenge in DA-FSL: the DA objective means that the source and\ntarget data distributions need to be aligned, typically through a shared\ndomain-adaptive feature embedding space; but the FSL objective dictates that\nthe target domain per class distribution must be different from that of any\nsource domain class, meaning aligning the distributions across domains may harm\nthe FSL performance. How to achieve global domain distribution alignment whilst\nmaintaining source/target per-class discriminativeness thus becomes the key.\nOur solution is to explicitly enhance the source/target per-class separation\nbefore domain-adaptive feature embedding learning in the DAPN, in order to\nalleviate the negative effect of domain alignment on FSL. Extensive experiments\nshow that our DAPN outperforms the state-of-the-art FSL and DA models, as well\nas their na\\\"ive combinations.

The Strahler number of a parity game is proposed\nto be defined as the smallest Strahler number of the tree of any of its\nattractor decompositions. It is proved that parity games can be solved in\nquasi-linear space and in time that is polynomial in the number of vertices~$n$\nand linear in $({d}/{2k})^k$, where $d$ is the number of priorities and $k$ is\nthe Strahler number. This complexity is quasi-polynomial because the Strahler\nnumber is at most logarithmic in the number of vertices. The proof is based on\na new construction of small Strahler-universal trees.\n  It is shown that the Strahler number of a parity game is a robust parameter:\nit coincides with its alternative version based on trees of progress measures\nand with the register number defined by Lehtinen~(2018). It follows that parity\ngames can be solved in quasi-linear space and in time that is polynomial in the\nnumber of vertices and linear in $({d}/{2k})^k$, where $k$ is the register\nnumber.

They are often characterized by\nthe presence of large gas and dust reservoirs that are thought to sustain and\npossibly obscure vigorous star formation processes that make these objects\nshine at far-IR and sub-mm wavelengths. We exploit ALMA Cycle 4 observations of\nthe continuum (~2.1mm) and high-J CO emission of a sample of six X-ray selected\nSMGs hosting an obscured AGN at z_spec>2.5 in the 7 Ms CDF-S. We measured the\nmasses and sizes of the dust and molecular gas and we derived the gas density\nand column density on the basis of a uniform sphere geometry. Finally, we\ncompared the measured column densities with those derived from the Chandra\nX-ray spectra. We detected both the continuum and line emission for three\nsources for which we measured both the flux density and size. For the\nundetected sources, we derived an upper limit on the flux density.

The SKA and\nthe AVN will enable very high sensitivity VLBI in the southern hemisphere. In\nthe current AVN network, there is a gap in coverage in the central African\nregion. This work analyses the scientific impact if new antennas were to be\nbuilt or old telecommunication facilities were to be converted to radio\ntelescopes in each of the six countries in central Africa i.e. Cameroon, Gabon,\nCongo, Equatorial Guinea, Chad, Central African Republic. The work also\ndiscusses some economical and skills transfer impacts of having a radio\ninterferometer in this area of Africa.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Mar 2020 09:36:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-20"}

We centre our attention to\na situation where one would like to distribute quantum entanglement between\nprincipal particles that are apart. In this case, it is necessary to use\nancillary systems that are communicated between them or interact with them\ncontinuously. Cubitt et al. showed that the ancillary systems need not be\nentangled with the principal particles in order to distribute entanglement.\nThis has been demonstrated experimentally in the case of communicated ancillary\nparticles and it is now known that the bound on the distributed entanglement is\ngiven by a communicated quantum discord. On the other hand, little is\nunderstood about the setting with continuous interactions, despite its abundant\noccurrence in nature. The main focus of this thesis is to study the\ndistribution of quantum entanglement via continuous interactions with ancillary\nparticles, which I will call mediators.

The\nproposed design gives a practical implementation of tuning elements inside the\nwaveguide providing alternatives to the use of the E-plane split waveguide at\nhigh frequencies in order to avoid leakage losses. The depicted phase shifter\ndesign is based on a H-plane split waveguide. The phase shift is controlled by\nmeans of a tuning screw, which exerts pressure on a flexible metallic strip\ninserted inside the waveguide. The flexible strip bends with different\ncurvature radii and determines the phase shift at the output port.\nCost-effective manufacturing and simple implementation of the flexible metallic\nstrip are achieved by means of the gap-waveguide design. A prototype has been\nmanufactured for validation purposes. Good impedance matching is achieved from\n64 GHz to 75 GHz providing a 15.8% impedance bandwidth.

This method uses harmonic inputs which\nestablish a natural way for data acquisition. For the general class of\nnonlinear problems with VS representation, the growing exponential approach\nallows the derivation of the generalized kernels, namely symmetric generalized\nfrequency response functions - (GFRFs). In addition, the homogeneity of the\nVolterra operator determines the accuracy in terms of how many kernels are\nconsidered. For the weakly nonlinear setup, only a few kernels are needed to\nobtain a good approximation. In this direction, the proposed adaptive scheme is\nable to improve the estimations of the computationally non-zero kernels. The\nFourier transform associates these measurements with the derived GFRFs and the\nLF makes the connection with system theory. In the linear case, the LF\nassociates the so-called S-parameters with the linear transfer function by\ninterpolating in the frequency domain. The goal of the proposed method is to\nextend identification to the case of bilinear systems from time-domain\nmeasurements and to approximate other general nonlinear systems (by means of\nthe Carleman bilinearizarion scheme). By identifying the linear contribution\nwith the LF, a considerable reduction is achieved by means of the SVD. The\nfitted linear system has the same McMillan degree as the original linear\nsystem. Then, the performance of the linear model is improved by augmenting a\nspecial nonlinear structure.

Therefore, how to develop\naccurate traffic prediction while preserving privacy is a significant problem\nto be solved, and there is a trade-off between these two objectives. To address\nthis challenge, we introduce a privacy-preserving machine learning technique\nnamed federated learning and propose a Federated Learning-based Gated Recurrent\nUnit neural network algorithm (FedGRU) for traffic flow prediction. FedGRU\ndiffers from current centralized learning methods and updates universal\nlearning models through a secure parameter aggregation mechanism rather than\ndirectly sharing raw data among organizations. In the secure parameter\naggregation mechanism, we adopt a Federated Averaging algorithm to reduce the\ncommunication overhead during the model parameter transmission process.\nFurthermore, we design a Joint Announcement Protocol to improve the scalability\nof FedGRU. We also propose an ensemble clustering-based scheme for traffic flow\nprediction by grouping the organizations into clusters before applying FedGRU\nalgorithm. Through extensive case studies on a real-world dataset, it is shown\nthat FedGRU's prediction accuracy is 90.96% higher than the advanced deep\nlearning models, which confirm that FedGRU can achieve accurate and timely\ntraffic prediction without compromising the privacy and security of raw data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Mar 2020 13:07:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-04"}

However, the visual observation of an encounter\nbetween a cell and a target does not necessarily indicate the presence of a\nchemotactic approach mechanism, as even a blindly migrating cell can come\nacross a target by chance. To distinguish between the chemotactic approach and\nblind migration, we present an objective method that is based on the analysis\nof time-lapse recorded cell migration trajectories. First, we validate our\nmethod with simulated data, demonstrating that it reliably detects the presence\nor absence of remote cell-cell interactions. In a second step, we apply the\nmethod to data from three-dimensional collagen gels, interspersed with highly\nmigratory natural killer (NK) cells that were derived from two different human\ndonors.

Despite achieving high performance,\nit is still largely unknown how well existing detectors generalize to unseen\ndata. This is important because a practical detector should be ready to use in\nvarious scenarios in applications. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive\nstudy in this paper, using a general principle of direct cross-dataset\nevaluation. Through this study, we find that existing state-of-the-art\npedestrian detectors, though perform quite well when trained and tested on the\nsame dataset, generalize poorly in cross dataset evaluation. We demonstrate\nthat there are two reasons for this trend. Firstly, their designs (e.g. anchor\nsettings) may be biased towards popular benchmarks in the traditional\nsingle-dataset training and test pipeline, but as a result largely limit their\ngeneralization capability. Secondly, the training source is generally not dense\nin pedestrians and diverse in scenarios. Under direct cross-dataset evaluation,\nsurprisingly, we find that a general purpose object detector, without\npedestrian-tailored adaptation in design, generalizes much better compared to\nexisting state-of-the-art pedestrian detectors. Furthermore, we illustrate that\ndiverse and dense datasets, collected by crawling the web, serve to be an\nefficient source of pre-training for pedestrian detection.

In the problem Minimum Scan Cover with Angular Costs (MSC), we\nare given a graph $G$ that is embedded in Euclidean space. The edges of $G$\nneed to be scanned, i.e., probed from both of their vertices. In order to scan\ntheir edge, two vertices need to face each other; changing the heading of a\nvertex takes some time proportional to the corresponding turn angle. Our goal\nis to minimize the time until all scans are completed, i.e., to compute a\nschedule of minimum makespan.\n  We show that MSC is closely related to both graph coloring and the minimum\n(directed and undirected) cut cover problem; in particular, we show that the\nminimum scan time for instances in 1D and 2D lies in $\\Theta(\\log \\chi (G))$,\nwhile for 3D the minimum scan time is not upper bounded by $\\chi (G)$.

For this, it is necessary to design a free layer whose magnetization\ncan be stabilized along several or even any in-plane direction between the\nparallel and the antiparallel magnetic configurations. We experimentally show\nthat this can be achieved by exploiting antiferromagnet-ferromagnet exchange\ninteractions in a regime where the antiferromagnet is thin enough to induce\nenhanced coercivity and no exchange bias. The frustration of exchange\ninteractions at the interfaces due to competing ferro- and antiferromagnetic\ninteractions is at the origin of an isotropic dissipation mechanism yielding\nisotropic coercivity. From a modeling point of view, it is shown that this\nisotropic dissipation can be described by a dry friction term in the\nLandau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation.

Since the data size of each user's computational task varies over time,\nthe HABs must dynamically adjust the user association, service sequence, and\ntask partition scheme to meet the users' needs.

It has recently been shown that instead of solving a system of\nequations as in standard numerical methods, a neural network can be trained\nsolely based on initial and boundary conditions. Neural networks are smooth,\ndifferentiable functions that can be used as a global ansatz for Partial\nDifferential Equations (PDEs). While this idea dates back to more than 20 years\nago [Lagaris et al., 1998], it is only recently that an approach for the\nsolution of time dependent problems has been developed [Raissi et al., 2019].\nWith the latter, implicit Runge Kutta schemes with unprecedented high order\nhave been constructed to solve scalar-valued PDEs. We build on the\naforementioned work in order to develop an Updated Lagrangian method for the\nsolution of incompressible free surface flow subject to the inviscid Euler\nequations. The method is easy to implement and does not require any specific\nalgorithmic treatment which is usually necessary to accurately resolve the\nincompressibility constraint. Due to its meshfree character, we will name it\nthe Neural Particle Method (NPM). It will be demonstrated that the NPM remains\nstable and accurate even if the location of discretization points is highly\nirregular.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 18 Mar 2020 21:42:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Mar 2020 09:35:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 8 May 2020 07:50:01 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 3 Jun 2020 09:50:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-04"}

In normal circumstances,\nthe x-ray amplification from this type of the physical processes is implausible\nbecause its phase, which is the \\textbf{non-resonant} perturbation, is not\nsuitable for transferring the energy from the visible light laser to the x-ray.\nAs proposed in this paper, this undesirable phase can be manipulated into the\ndesirable one. Two situations are considered. The first case is in the presence\nof the strong plasma density gradient. A lasting amplification is possible when\na strong Langmuir wave, whose phase velocity matches with the x-ray group\nvelocity, provides the density gradient along the way of the x-ray propagation.\n  The second case is in the presence of a pre-excited Langmuir wave. The author\nconsiders two lasers, with their frequency differing by the Langmuir wave,\ncounter-propagating and exciting a rather strong Langmuir wave. In the presence\nof the mentioned Langmuir wave, it is demonstrated that the ponderomotive\ninteraction between the x-ray and one of the lasers excites the plasma density\nperturbation with a desired phase, resulting to amplify (decay) the x-ray\n(visible light laser). The condition for achieving the mentioned favorable\nphase and the amplification strength, when the condition is met, is estimated.\nThe amplification strength is quite high, where the gain per length could reach\n1000 per cm in both cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Mar 2020 14:53:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-24"}

At this height, the sheep\nare relatively small, only about 15 pixels across. Although deep learning\nstrategies have gained enormous popularity in the last decade and are now\nextensively used for object detection in many fields, state-of-the-art\ndetectors perform poorly in the case of smaller objects. We develop a novel\ndataset of UAV imagery of sheep and consider a variety of object detectors to\ndetermine which is the most suitable for our task in terms of both accuracy and\nspeed. Our findings indicate that a UNet detector using the weighted Hausdorff\ndistance as a loss function during training is an excellent option for\ndetection of sheep onboard a UAV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Mar 2020 00:40:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-07"}

This\nsurvey discusses the important/necessary properties of activation function and\nthe most widely used activation functions (sigmoid, tanh, ReLU, LReLU and\nPReLU).
