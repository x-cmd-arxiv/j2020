To achieve this goal, we propose\nadding a large number of artifacts, which we called $attractors$, onto the\notherwise smooth function. An attractor is a point in the input space, where\nsamples in its neighborhood have gradient pointing toward it. We observe that\ndecoders of watermarking schemes exhibit properties of attractors and give a\ngeneric method that injects attractors from a watermark decoder into the victim\nmodel ${\\mathcal M}$.

Seeding has been\nsuccessfully applied to investigate the nucleation of crystals in supercooled\nfluids and here we apply it for the fist time --to the best of our knowledge--\nto the liquid-to-vapor transition. We find that Seeding provides nucleation\nrates that are consistent with independent calculations not based on the\nassumptions of Classical Nucleation Theory. Different criteria to determine the\nradius of the critical bubble give different rate values. The accuracy of each\ncriterion depends of the degree of superheating. Moreover, Seeding simulations\nshow that the surface tension depends on pressure for a given temperature.\nTherefore, using Classical Nucleation Theory with the coexistence surface\ntension does not provide good estimates of the nucleation rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Mar 2020 16:35:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-06"}

The pressure inside such drops is larger than the atmospheric one by\nvirtue of the Laplace equation. In this work, we take into account such\npressure raise in order to predict the nucleation rate in droplets using the\nTIP4P/Ice water model. We start from a recent estimate of the maximum drop size\nthat can be used at each supercooling avoiding simultaneous nucleation events\n[Espinosa et al. J. Chem. Phys., 2016]. We then evaluate the pressure inside\nthe drops with the Laplace equation.

Firstly, a two-stage\nuncertainty-aware prediction is proposed.

Mass and spin\nmeasurements from coalescences can be used to distinguish between an\nastrophysical or a primordial origin of the binary black holes. In standard\nscenarios the spin of primordial black holes is very small at formation.\nHowever, the mass and spin can evolve through the cosmic history due to\naccretion. We show that the mass and spin of primordial black holes are\ncorrelated in a redshift-dependent fashion, in particular primordial black\nholes with masses below ${\\cal O}(30)M_\\odot$ are likely non-spinning at any\nredshift, whereas heavier black holes can be nearly extremal up to redshift\n$z\\sim10$. The dependence of the mass and spin distributions on the redshift\ncan be probed with future detectors such as the Einstein Telescope. The mass\nand spin evolution affect the gravitational waveform parameters, in particular\nthe distribution of the final mass and spin of the merger remnant, and that of\nthe effective spin of the binary. We argue that, compared to the\nastrophysical-formation scenario, a primordial origin of black hole binaries\nmight better explain the spin distribution of merger events detected by\nLIGO-Virgo, in which the effective spin parameter of the binary is compatible\nto zero except possibly for few high-mass events.

Due to their spike-based computational\nmodel, SNNs can process output from event-based, asynchronous sensors without\nany pre-processing at extremely lower power unlike standard artificial neural\nnetworks. This is possible due to specialized neuromorphic hardware that\nimplements the highly-parallelizable concept of SNNs in silicon. Yet, SNNs have\nnot enjoyed the same rise of popularity as artificial neural networks. This not\nonly stems from the fact that their input format is rather unconventional but\nalso due to the challenges in training spiking networks. Despite their temporal\nnature and recent algorithmic advances, they have been mostly evaluated on\nclassification problems. We propose, for the first time, a temporal regression\nproblem of numerical values given events from an event camera. We specifically\ninvestigate the prediction of the 3-DOF angular velocity of a rotating event\ncamera with an SNN. The difficulty of this problem arises from the prediction\nof angular velocities continuously in time directly from irregular,\nasynchronous event-based input. Directly utilising the output of event cameras\nwithout any pre-processing ensures that we inherit all the benefits that they\nprovide over conventional cameras. That is high-temporal resolution,\nhigh-dynamic range and no motion blur. To assess the performance of SNNs on\nthis task, we introduce a synthetic event camera dataset generated from\nreal-world panoramic images and show that we can successfully train an SNN to\nperform angular velocity regression.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Mar 2020 17:37:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-06"}

Consequently, pruning techniques have\nbeen proposed that remove less significant weights in deep networks, thereby\nreducing their memory and computational requirements. Pruning is usually\nperformed after training the original network, and is followed by further\nretraining to compensate for the accuracy loss incurred during pruning. The\nprune-and-retrain procedure is repeated iteratively until an optimum tradeoff\nbetween accuracy and efficiency is reached. However, such iterative retraining\nadds to the overall training complexity of the network. In this work, we\npropose a dynamic pruning-while-training procedure, wherein we prune filters of\nthe convolutional layers of a deep network during training itself, thereby\nprecluding the need for separate retraining. We evaluate our dynamic\npruning-while-training approach with three different pre-existing pruning\nstrategies, viz. mean activation-based pruning, random pruning, and L1\nnormalization-based pruning. Our results for VGG-16 trained on CIFAR10 shows\nthat L1 normalization provides the best performance among all the techniques\nexplored in this work with less than 1% drop in accuracy after pruning 80% of\nthe filters compared to the original network. We further evaluated the L1\nnormalization based pruning mechanism on CIFAR100. Results indicate that\npruning while training yields a compressed network with almost no accuracy loss\nafter pruning 50% of the filters compared to the original network and ~5% loss\nfor high pruning rates (>80%).

The suppression\nof thermalization is achieved in two complementary ways: by adding local\nperturbations or by adjusting the driving Rabi frequency according to the local\nconnectivity of the lattice. We demonstrate that these mechanisms allow to\nrealize robust quantum scars in various two-dimensional lattices, including\ndecorated lattices with non-constant connectivity. In particular, we show that\na small decrease of the Rabi frequency at the corners of the lattice is crucial\nfor mitigating the strong boundary effects in two-dimensional systems. Our\nresults identify synchronization as an important tool for future experiments on\ntwo-dimensional quantum scars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Mar 2020 18:54:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Jun 2020 17:46:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

This research analyzes the role of the body\nforce in the original SFM. We focused on the parameter associated with the body\nstiffness (kn) and its impact on the pedestrian dynamics for two different\ngeometries: bottlenecks and corridors. Increasing kn produces opposite effects\non the crowd dynamics for each geometry: an increase of the crowd velocity for\nbottlenecks, and a decrease for corridors. The former reflects the fact that an\nincrease in the stiffness reduces the overlap between pedestrians and, as a\nconsequence, the sliding friction is diminished. This phenomenon reduces the\nnumber of blocking clusters close to the exit door. In the case of the\ncorridor, instead, due to the confining walls, the pedestrians get tight into a\nlattice-like configuration due to space limitations. The friction interaction\nwith the walls determines the velocity of the whole crowd along the corridor.\nAdditionally, the corridor geometry generates a flux slowing down for very\ncrowded environments, as observed in many real-life situations.

For\nexample, style transfer, object transfiguration, visually altering the\nappearance of weather conditions in an image, changing the appearance of a day\nimage into a night image or vice versa, photo enhancement, to name a few.

Our techniques are\nmodifications of two existing techniques, neural style transfer, and\ncycle-consistent generative-adversarial network. Neural style transfer renders\nthe semantic content of an image from one domain in the style of a different\nimage in another domain, whereas a cycle-consistent generative adversarial\nnetwork learns the mapping from an input image to output image without any\npaired training data, and also learn a loss function to train this mapping.\nFurthermore, the techniques we propose are independent of any embroidery\nattributes, such as elevation of the image, light-source, start, and endpoints\nof a stitch, type of stitch used, fabric type, etc. Given the user image, our\ntechniques can generate a preview image which looks similar to an embroidered\nimage. We train and test our propose techniques on an embroidery dataset which\nconsist of simple 2D images. To do so, we prepare an unpaired embroidery\ndataset with more than 8000 user-uploaded images along with embroidered images.\nEmpirical results show that these techniques successfully generate an\napproximate preview of an embroidered version of a user image, which can help\nusers in decision making.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Mar 2020 20:32:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-09"}

The authors\nalso released multilingual BERT (mBERT), a model trained on a corpus of 104\nlanguages, which can serve as a universal language model. This model obtained\nimpressive results on a zero-shot cross-lingual natural inference task. Driven\nby the potential of BERT models, the NLP community has started to investigate\nand generate an abundant number of BERT models that are trained on a particular\nlanguage, and tested on a specific data domain and task.

Linear, or\nsimple parametric, models are often not sufficient to describe complex\nrelationships between input variables and a response. Such relationships can be\nbetter described through flexible approaches such as neural networks, but this\nresults in less interpretable models and potential overfitting. Alternatively,\nspecific parametric nonlinear functions can be used, but the specification of\nsuch functions is in general complicated. In this paper, we introduce a\nflexible approach for the construction and selection of highly flexible\nnonlinear parametric regression models. Nonlinear features are generated\nhierarchically, similarly to deep learning, but have additional flexibility on\nthe possible types of features to be considered. This flexibility, combined\nwith variable selection, allows us to find a small set of important features\nand thereby more interpretable models. Within the space of possible functions,\na Bayesian approach, introducing priors for functions based on their\ncomplexity, is considered. A genetically modified mode jumping Markov chain\nMonte Carlo algorithm is adopted to perform Bayesian inference and estimate\nposterior probabilities for model averaging. In various applications, we\nillustrate how our approach is used to obtain meaningful nonlinear models.\nAdditionally, we compare its predictive performance with several machine\nlearning algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Mar 2020 21:20:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Nov 2021 11:15:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-24"}

One natural approach for detecting such\nchanges is to use non-parametric two-sample statistical tests. However, in\nsingle-cell studies, direct application of these tests is often inadequate\nbecause single-cell level expression data from uninfected populations often\ncontains attributes of several latent sub-populations with highly heterogeneous\ncharacteristics. As a result, viruses often infect these different\nsub-populations at different rates in which case the traditional nonparametric\ntwo-sample tests for checking similarity in distributions are no longer\nconservative. We propose a new nonparametric method for Testing Remodeling\nUnder Heterogeneity (TRUH) that can accurately detect changes in the infected\nsamples compared to possibly heterogeneous uninfected samples. Our testing\nframework is based on composite nulls and is designed to allow the null model\nto encompass the possibility that the infected samples, though unaltered by the\nvirus, might be dominantly arising from under-represented sub-populations in\nthe baseline data. The TRUH statistic, which uses nearest neighbor projections\nof the infected samples into the baseline uninfected population, is calibrated\nusing a novel bootstrap algorithm. We demonstrate the non-asymptotic\nperformance of the test via simulation experiments and derive the large sample\nlimit of the test statistic, which provides theoretical support towards\nconsistent asymptotic calibration of the test. We use the TRUH statistic for\nstudying remodeling in tonsillar T cells under different types of HIV infection\nand find that unlike traditional tests, TRUH based statistical inference\nconforms to the biologically validated immunological theories on HIV infection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Mar 2020 21:37:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Jun 2020 18:16:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-26"}

This includes 2.5D volumetric heatmaps, whose X and Y\naxes correspond to image space and the Z axis to metric depth around the\nsubject. To obtain metric-scale predictions, these methods must include a\nseparate, explicit post-processing step to resolve scale ambiguity. Further,\nthey cannot encode body joint positions outside of the image boundaries,\nleading to incomplete pose estimates in case of image truncation. We address\nthese limitations by proposing metric-scale truncation-robust (MeTRo)\nvolumetric heatmaps, whose dimensions are defined in metric 3D space near the\nsubject, instead of being aligned with image space. We train a\nfully-convolutional network to estimate such heatmaps from monocular RGB in an\nend-to-end manner. This reinterpretation of the heatmap dimensions allows us to\nestimate complete metric-scale poses without test-time knowledge of the focal\nlength or person distance and without relying on anthropometric heuristics in\npost-processing. Furthermore, as the image space is decoupled from the heatmap\nspace, the network can learn to reason about joints beyond the image boundary.\nUsing ResNet-50 without any additional learned layers, we obtain\nstate-of-the-art results on the Human3.6M and MPI-INF-3DHP benchmarks.

First-principles\ncalculations of the polarization-projected Si- and Fe-partial phonon\ndispersions and PDOS enable the disentanglement of the contribution of the\n$xy$- and $z$-polarized phonons to the experimental PDOS. Modeling of the\nexperimental data with the theoretical results unveils an enhanced damping of\nthe $z$-polarized phonons for islands with average sizes below 10 nm. This\nphenomenon is attributed to the fact that the low-energy $z$-polarized phonons\ncouple to the low-energy surface/interface vibrational modes. The thermodynamic\nand elastic properties obtained from the experimental data show a pronounced\nsize-dependent behavior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Mar 2020 00:04:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-16"}

This results in turn in\na strong screening that prevents the applied electric field inside the nanowire\nfrom increasing further beyond around 200 kV/cm for InAs nanowires. Therefore,\nfurther increase in the gate voltage will not increase $\\alpha_R$. This finding\nclarifies the physical trends to be expected in nanowire Rashba SOC and the\nroles played by the nano size and electric field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Mar 2020 01:02:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-09"}

To avoid a\nlarger outbreak in the worldwide, Chinese government carried out a series of\nstrong strategies to prevent the situation from deteriorating. Home quarantine\nis the most important one to prevent the spread of COVID-19. In order to\nestimate the effect of population quarantine, we divide the population into\nseven categories for simulation.

Numerical simulations show that the proposed model can describe the\ntransmission of COVID-19 accurately, the corresponding prediction of the trend\nof the disease is given. The home quarantine strategy plays an important role\nin controlling the disease spread and speeding up the decline of COVID-19. The\ncontrol reproduction number of most provinces in China are analyzed and\ndiscussed adequately. We should pay attention to that, though the epidemic is\nin decline in China, the disease still has high risk of human-to-human\ntransmission continuously. Once the control strategy is removed, COVID-19 may\nbecome a normal epidemic disease just like flu. Further control for the disease\nis still necessary, we focus on the relationship between the spread rate of the\nvirus and the meteorological conditions. A comprehensive meteorological index\nis introduced to represent the impact of meteorological factors on both high\nand low migration groups. As the progress on the new vaccine, we design detail\nvaccination strategies for COVID-19 in different control phases and show the\neffectiveness of efficient vaccination.

This leads to the DSA power-law distribution extending from the\nsmallest momentum of reflected electrons, $p_{\\rm ref}$, all the way to the\ncutoff momentum, $p_{\\rm eq}$, constrained by radiative cooling. In the later\ncase, fossil electrons, specified by a power-law spectrum with a cutoff, are\nassumed to be re-accelerated also from $p_{\\rm ref}$ up to $p_{\\rm eq}$ via\nDSA. We then show that, in the in situ acceleration model, the amplitude of\nradio synchrotron emission depends strongly on the shock Mach number, whereas\nit varies rather weakly in the re-acceleration model.

This simple combination is\ninteresting because it features self-assembly that occurs both far from\nequilibrium and at a finite temperature, with the better-explored systems\nconstituting respectively its zero temperature and near-equilibrium limits.\nTheories applicable to either of the two limits qualitatively predict the chain\nlength distributions, except that chains in our experiments are shorter, which\nwe attribute to the simultaneous presence of thermal fluctuations and fluid\nshear forces that work in concert to break chains apart. Our most striking\nresult is that the disorder in the SPION chains gradually dissipates over a\ntimescale of tens of minutes, about two orders of magnitude slower than the\ncharacteristic chain assembly time. The disorder dissipation can be sped up by\nincreasing particle concentration and solution ionic strength, both of which\nincrease the speed of chain assembly. This strongly suggests that the\nimprovement in chain order with time is not due to thermal fluctuations but\nrather to energy imparted by the self-assembly process, which continually\ncauses chains to grow and break apart, even when a steady state distribution\nhas obtained.

This polarization is\ncomparable to that of solid state ferroelectrics, and is close to the average\nvalue obtained by assuming perfect, polar alignment of molecular long axes in\nthe nematic. We find a host of spectacular optical and hydrodynamic effects\ndriven by ultra-low applied field (E~1V/cm), produced by the coupling of the\nlarge polarization to nematic birefringence and flow. Electrostatic\nself-interaction of the polarization charge renders the transition from the\nnematic phase mean-field-like and weakly first-order, and controls the director\nfield structure of the ferroelectric phase. Atomistic molecular dynamics\nsimulation reveals short-range polar molecular interactions that favor\nferroelectric ordering, including a tendency for head-to-tail association into\npolar, chain-like assemblies having polar lateral correlations. These results\nindicate a significant potential for transformative new nematic science and\ntechnology based on the enhanced understanding, development, and exploitation\nof molecular electrostatic interaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Mar 2020 03:54:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 20 Apr 2020 00:13:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-09"}

A backdoored model\nbehaves normally on clean test images, yet consistently predicts a particular\ntarget class for any test examples that contain the trigger pattern. As such,\nbackdoor attacks are hard to detect, and have raised severe security concerns\nin real-world applications. Thus far, backdoor research has mostly been\nconducted in the image domain with image classification models. In this paper,\nwe show that existing image backdoor attacks are far less effective on videos,\nand outline 4 strict conditions where existing attacks are likely to fail: 1)\nscenarios with more input dimensions (eg. videos), 2) scenarios with high\nresolution, 3) scenarios with a large number of classes and few examples per\nclass (a \"sparse dataset\"), and 4) attacks with access to correct labels (eg.\nclean-label attacks).

We prove that MFGDS are extensions of multitype\nGalton-Watson (MGW) forests, since mixing the laws of the former, one obtains\nMGW forests with fixed sizes by type (CMGW). We also obtain the law of the\ntotal population by types in a MGW forest, generalizing Otter-Dwass formula\n(Otter 1949, Dwass 1969). We apply this to obtain enumerations of plane,\nlabeled and binary multitype forests having fixed roots and individuals by\ntypes. We give an algorithm to simulate certain CMGW forests, generalizing the\nunitype case of (Devroye, 2012).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Mar 2020 05:22:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Mar 2020 07:28:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 8 Apr 2021 21:22:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-12"}

Despite several attempts at\nalternative schemes, magic state distillation remains one of the most efficient\nschemes for simulating non-Clifford gates in a fault-tolerant way. However,\nsince magic state distillation circuits are not fault-tolerant, all Clifford\noperations must be encoded in a large distance code in order to have comparable\nfailure rates with the magic states being distilled. In this work, we introduce\na new concept which we call redundant ancilla encoding. The latter combined\nwith flag qubits allows for circuits to both measure stabilizer generators of\nsome code, while also being able to measure global operators to\nfault-tolerantly prepare magic states, all using nearest neighbor interactions.\nIn particular, we apply such schemes to a planar architecture of the triangular\ncolor code family. In addition to our scheme being suitable for experimental\nimplementations, we show that for physical error rates near $10^{-4}$ and under\na full circuit-level noise model, our scheme can produce magic states using an\norder of magnitude fewer qubits and space-time overhead compared to the most\ncompetitive magic state distillation schemes. Further, we can take advantage of\nthe fault-tolerance of our circuits to produce magic states with very low\nlogical failure rates using encoded Clifford gates with noise rates comparable\nto the magic states being injected. Thus, stabilizer operations are not\nrequired to be encoded in a very large distance code.

Although the disc instability model is widely accepted as the\nexplanation for dwarf nova outbursts, it is still necessary to confront its\npredictions to observations because much of the constraints on angular momentum\ntransport in accretion discs are derived from the application of this model to\nreal systems.\n  Aims. We test the predictions of the model concerning the multicolour time\nevolution of outbursts for two well--observed systems, SS Cyg and VW Hyi.\n  Methods. We calculate the multicolour evolution of dwarf nova outbursts using\nthe disc instability model and taking into account the contribution from the\nirradiated secondary, the white dwarf and the hot spot.\n  Results. Observations definitely show the existence of a hysteresis in the\noptical colour-magnitude diagram during the evolution of dwarf nova outbursts.\nWe find that the disc instability model naturally explains the existence and\nthe orientation of this hysteresis. For the specific cases of SS Cyg and VW\nHyi, the colour and magnitude ranges covered during the evolution of the system\nare in reasonable agreement with observations. However, the observed colours\nare bluer than observed near the peak of the outbursts -- as in steady systems,\nand the amplitude of the hysteresis cycle is smaller than observed.

We\npropose the CPQ-aware path index CPQx, the first path index tailored to the\nexpressivity of CPQ. CPQx is built on the partition of the set of source-target\nvertex pairs of paths in a graph based on the structural notion of\npath-bisimulation.

Unlike the\nconventional designs that force the source to use a single bit rate according\nto the receiver with the worst channel quality, soft video delivery schemes\ntransmit the video such that the video quality at each receiver is commensurate\nwith its specific instantaneous channel quality. In this paper, we present a\nsoft video multicasting system using an adaptive block-based compressed sensing\n(BCS) method. The proposed system consists of an encoder, a transmission\nsystem, and a decoder. At the encoder side, each block in each frame of the\ninput video is adaptively sampled with a rate that depends on the texture\ncomplexity and visual saliency of the block. The obtained BCS samples are then\nplaced into several packets, and the packets are transmitted via a\nchannel-aware OFDM (orthogonal frequency division multiplexing) transmission\nsystem with a number of subchannels. At the decoder side, the received BCS\nsamples are first used to build an initial approximation of the transmitted\nframe. To further improve the reconstruction quality, an iterative BCS\nreconstruction algorithm is then proposed that uses an adaptive transform and\nan adaptive soft-thresholding operator, which exploits the temporal similarity\nbetween adjacent frames to achieve better reconstruction quality. The extensive\nobjective and subjective experimental results indicate the superiority of the\nproposed system over the state-of-the-art soft video multicasting systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Mar 2020 09:08:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-09"}

However, it is well-known\nthat machine learning models are vulnerable to adversarial examples (AEs).\nPrevious works have shown that ML malware classifiers are fragile to the\nwhite-box adversarial attacks. However, ML models used in commercial antivirus\nproducts are usually not available to attackers and only return hard\nclassification labels. Therefore, it is more practical to evaluate the\nrobustness of ML models and real-world AVs in a pure black-box manner. We\npropose a black-box Reinforcement Learning (RL) based framework to generate AEs\nfor PE malware classifiers and AV engines. It regards the adversarial attack\nproblem as a multi-armed bandit problem, which finds an optimal balance between\nexploiting the successful patterns and exploring more varieties. Compared to\nother frameworks, our improvements lie in three points. 1) Limiting the\nexploration space by modeling the generation process as a stateless process to\navoid combination explosions. 2) Due to the critical role of payload in AE\ngeneration, we design to reuse the successful payload in modeling. 3)\nMinimizing the changes on AE samples to correctly assign the rewards in RL\nlearning.

It\nhas recently been demonstrated that using finite differences to discretize the\nsequence of linear problems obtained by quasi-linearization, Picard\nlinearization, or constant-slope linearization, leads to the usual iteration\nformula of the respective relaxation method. Thus, the linearization methods\ncan be used as a basis to derive the relaxation methods. In this work we\ndemonstrate that the shooting methods can be derived from the linearization\nmethods, too. We show that relaxing a shooting trajectory, i.e. an initial\nvalue problem solution, is in fact a projection transformation. The obtained\nfunction, called projection trajectory, can be used to correct the initial\ncondition. Using the new initial condition, we can find a new shooting\ntrajectory, and so on.

A shortest path algorithm based on the three-way greedy\nstrategy is designed to solve in dynamic charging sequence problem, and the\nimproved particle swarm optimization algorithm are used to solve the variable\nordered potential game.

These models represent a molecule\nas a graph using only the distance between atoms (nodes). They do not, however,\nconsider the spatial direction from one atom to another, despite directional\ninformation playing a central role in empirical potentials for molecules, e.g.\nin angular potentials. To alleviate this limitation we propose directional\nmessage passing, in which we embed the messages passed between atoms instead of\nthe atoms themselves. Each message is associated with a direction in coordinate\nspace. These directional message embeddings are rotationally equivariant since\nthe associated directions rotate with the molecule. We propose a message\npassing scheme analogous to belief propagation, which uses the directional\ninformation by transforming messages based on the angle between them.\nAdditionally, we use spherical Bessel functions and spherical harmonics to\nconstruct theoretically well-founded, orthogonal representations that achieve\nbetter performance than the currently prevalent Gaussian radial basis\nrepresentations while using fewer than 1/4 of the parameters. We leverage these\ninnovations to construct the directional message passing neural network\n(DimeNet). DimeNet outperforms previous GNNs on average by 76% on MD17 and by\n31% on QM9.

A neural network adjusts its\nparameters when learning a new task, but then fails to conduct the old tasks\nwell. By contrast, the brain has a powerful ability to continually learn new\nexperience without catastrophic interference. The underlying neural mechanisms\npossibly attribute to the interplay of hippocampus-dependent memory system and\nneocortex-dependent memory system, mediated by prefrontal cortex. Specifically,\nthe two memory systems develop specialized mechanisms to consolidate\ninformation as more specific forms and more generalized forms, respectively,\nand complement the two forms of information in the interplay. Inspired by such\nbrain strategy, we propose a novel approach named triple memory networks (TMNs)\nfor continual learning. TMNs model the interplay of hippocampus, prefrontal\ncortex and sensory cortex (a neocortex region) as a triple-network architecture\nof generative adversarial networks (GAN). The input information is encoded as\nspecific representation of the data distributions in a generator, or\ngeneralized knowledge of solving tasks in a discriminator and a classifier,\nwith implementing appropriate brain-inspired algorithms to alleviate\ncatastrophic forgetting in each module.

To meet this challenge, a new\nfamily of modal FRP languages has been proposed, in which variants of Nakano's\nguarded fixed point operator are used for writing recursive programs\nguaranteeing properties such as causality and productivity. As an apparent\nextension to this it has also been suggested to use Linear Temporal Logic (LTL)\nas a language for reactive programming through the Curry-Howard isomorphism,\nallowing properties such as termination, liveness and fairness to be encoded in\ntypes. However, these two ideas are in conflict with each other, since the\nfixed point operator introduces non-termination into the inductive types that\nare supposed to provide termination guarantees.\n  In this paper we show that by regarding the modal time step operator of LTL a\nsubmodality of the one used for guarded recursion (rather than equating them),\none can obtain a modal type system capable of expressing liveness properties\nwhile retaining the power of the guarded fixed point operator. We introduce the\nlanguage Lively RaTT, a modal FRP language with a guarded fixed point operator\nand an `until' type constructor as in LTL, and show how to program with events\nand fair streams. Using a step-indexed Kripke logical relation we prove\noperational properties of Lively RaTT including productivity and causality as\nwell as the termination and liveness properties expected of types from LTL.\nFinally, we prove that the type system of Lively RaTT guarantees the absence of\nimplicit space leaks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Mar 2020 12:59:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 Aug 2020 12:00:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-21"}

We obtain the\ndesired results by designing and combining a geometric approach and an\nalgebraic approach, equipped with detailed studies and calculations of the\nstructures and coefficients of the corresponding non-strictly hyperbolic\nsystem. Moreover, the ill-posedness we depict also applies to 2D elastic waves,\nwhich corresponds to a strictly hyperbolic case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Mar 2020 13:33:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-09"}

This\nproblem of federated continual learning poses new challenges to continual\nlearning, such as utilizing knowledge from other clients, while preventing\ninterference from irrelevant knowledge. To resolve these issues, we propose a\nnovel federated continual learning framework, Federated Weighted Inter-client\nTransfer (FedWeIT), which decomposes the network weights into global federated\nparameters and sparse task-specific parameters, and each client receives\nselective knowledge from other clients by taking a weighted combination of\ntheir task-specific parameters. FedWeIT minimizes interference between\nincompatible tasks, and also allows positive knowledge transfer across clients\nduring learning. We validate our FedWeIT against existing federated learning\nand continual learning methods under varying degrees of task similarity across\nclients, and our model significantly outperforms them with a large reduction in\nthe communication cost.

Even with the help of\nexisting techniques to automatically detect leaks, writing a leak-free program\nremains tricky. One of the reasons is Android's event-driven programming model,\nwhich complicates the understanding of an application's overall control flow.\n  In this paper, we present PlumbDroid: a technique to automatically detect and\nfix resource leaks in Android applications. PlumbDroid uses static analysis to\nfind execution traces that may leak a resource. The information built for\ndetection also undergirds automatically building a fix -- consisting of release\noperations performed at appropriate locations -- that removes the leak and does\nnot otherwise affect the application's usage of the resource.\n  An empirical evaluation on resource leaks from the DroidLeaks curated\ncollection demonstrates that PlumbDroid's approach is scalable, precise, and\nproduces correct fixes for a variety of resource leak bugs: PlumbDroid\nautomatically found and repaired 50 leaks that affect 9 widely used resources\nof the Android system, including all those collected by DroidLeaks for those\nresources; on average, it took just 2 minutes to detect and repair a leak.\nPlumbDroid also compares favorably to Relda2/RelFix -- the only other fully\nautomated approach to repair Android resource leaks -- since it usually detects\nmore leaks with higher precision and producing smaller fixes. These results\nindicate that PlumbDroid can provide valuable support to enhance the quality of\nAndroid applications in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Mar 2020 13:42:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Jun 2021 08:16:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 28 Jun 2022 08:46:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-29"}

However, human experience and psychological\nstudies suggest that we do not always fix our gaze at each other's lips during\na face-to-face conversation, but rather scan the whole face repetitively. This\ninspires us to revisit a fundamental yet somehow overlooked problem: can VSR\nmodels benefit from reading extraoral facial regions, i.e. beyond the lips? In\nthis paper, we perform a comprehensive study to evaluate the effects of\ndifferent facial regions with state-of-the-art VSR models, including the mouth,\nthe whole face, the upper face, and even the cheeks. Experiments are conducted\non both word-level and sentence-level benchmarks with different\ncharacteristics.

Furthermore, we introduce a simple yet\neffective method based on Cutout to learn more discriminative features for\nface-based VSR, hoping to maximise the utility of information encoded in\ndifferent facial regions. Our experiments show obvious improvements over\nexisting state-of-the-art methods that use only the lip region as inputs, a\nresult we believe would probably provide the VSR community with some new and\nexciting insights.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Mar 2020 13:52:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Mar 2020 06:06:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-10"}

The electromagnetic and\nparticle radiation of stars drive thermal, chemical and physical alteration of\nplanetary atmospheres, including escape. Many known extrasolar planets\nexperience vastly different stellar environments than those in our Solar\nsystem: it is crucial to understand the broad range of processes that lead to\natmospheric escape and evolution under a wide range of conditions if we are to\nassess the habitability of worlds around other stars. One problem encountered\nbetween the planetary and the astrophysics communities is a lack of common\nlanguage for describing escape processes. Each community has customary\napproximations that may be questioned by the other, such as the hypothesis of\nH-dominated thermosphere for astrophysicists, or the Sun-like nature of the\nstars for planetary scientists. Since exoplanets are becoming one of the main\ntargets for the detection of life, a common set of definitions and hypotheses\nare required. We review the different escape mechanisms proposed for the\nevolution of planetary and exoplanetary atmospheres. We propose a common\ndefinition for the different escape mechanisms, and we show the important\nparameters to take into account when evaluating the escape at a planet in time.\nWe show that the paradigm of the magnetic field as an atmospheric shield should\nbe changed and that recent work on the history of Xenon in Earth's atmosphere\ngives an elegant explanation to its enrichment in heavier isotopes: the\nso-called Xenon paradox.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Mar 2020 14:14:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-02"}

To\nprovide a remedy for practitioners, our objective is to develop heuristic rules\nfor annotating a subset of questions, so that the annotation cost is reduced\nwhile maintaining both in- and out-of-domain performance. For this, we conduct\na large-scale analysis in order to derive practical recommendations. First, we\ndemonstrate experimentally that more training samples contribute often only to\na higher in-domain test-set performance, but do not help the model in\ngeneralizing to unseen datasets. Second, we develop a model-guided annotation\nstrategy: it makes a recommendation with regard to which subset of samples\nshould be annotated. Its effectiveness is demonstrated in a case study based on\ndomain customization of QA to a clinical setting. Here, remarkably, annotating\na stratified subset with only 1.2% of the original training set achieves 97.7%\nof the performance as if the complete dataset was annotated.

The opposite problem, i.e. the maximum crossing number, is receiving\ngrowing attention. Here we consider a complementary problem of the distribution\nof the number of edge crossings, namely the variance of the number of\ncrossings, when embedding the vertices of an arbitrary graph in some space at\nrandom. In his pioneering research, Moon derived that variance on random linear\narrangements of complete unipartite and bipartite graphs. Given the need of\nefficient algorithms to support this sort of research and given also the\ngrowing interest of the number of edge crossings in spatial networks, networks\nwhere vertices are embedded in some space, here we derive algorithms to\ncalculate the variance in arbitrary graphs in $o(nm^2)$-time, and in forests in\n$O(n)$-time. These algorithms work on a wide range of random layouts (not only\non Moon's) and are based on novel arithmetic expressions for the calculation of\nthe variance that we develop from previous theoretical work. This paves the way\nfor many applications that rely on a fast but exact calculation of the\nvariance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Mar 2020 14:55:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Feb 2021 18:21:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-22"}

Using the time-delay cosmography from strong\nlensing combined with the stellar kinematics of the deflector lens, we\ndemonstrate the Hubble constant and post-Newtonian parameter are incorporated\nin two distance ratios which reflect the lensing mass and dynamical mass,\nrespectively. Through the reanalysis of the four publicly released lenses\ndistance posteriors from the H0LiCOW collaboration, the simultaneous\nconstraints of Hubble constant and post-Newtonian parameter are obtained. Our\nresults suggests no deviation from the General Relativity,\n$\\gamma_{\\texttt{PPN}}=0.87^{+0.19}_{-0.17}$ with a Hubble constant favors the\nlocal Universe value, $H_0=73.65^{+1.95}_{-2.26}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$.\nFinally, we forecast the robustness of gravity tests by using the time-delay\nstrong lensing for constraints we expect in the next few years. We find that\nthe joint constraint from 40 lenses are able to reach the order of $7.7\\%$ for\nthe post-Newtonian parameter and $1.4\\%$ for Hubble constant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Mar 2020 15:28:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 2020 13:30:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-08"}

The high cost incurred limits the applications\nof the lottery ticket hypothesis. We show there exists a subset of the\naforementioned sub-networks that converge significantly faster during the\ntraining process and thus can mitigate the cost issue. We conduct extensive\nexperiments to show such sub-networks consistently exist across various model\nstructures for a restrictive setting of hyperparameters ($e.g.$, carefully\nselected learning rate, pruning ratio, and model capacity). As a practical\napplication of our findings, we demonstrate that such sub-networks can help in\ncutting down the total time of adversarial training, a standard approach to\nimprove robustness, by up to 49\\% on CIFAR-10 to achieve the state-of-the-art\nrobustness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Mar 2020 03:11:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-13"}

Location information is\none of the important ingredients for many LBS where the system requires to\nlocalize multiple targets in indoor setting. As an emerging technique,\ndevice-free localization (DFL) is promising to localize the target without\nattaching any transceivers. In this paper, we propose CoMuTe, the first\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) based device free multiple target\nlocalization leveraging the Channel State Information (CSI) from multiple\nwireless links. The system represents the CSIs as Multi-link Time-Frequency\n(MLTF) image by organizing them as time-frequency matrices and utilize these\nMLTF images as the input feature for CNN network. The CoMuTe models multi\ntarget localization as a multi label spot classification approach under the\nassumption that each MLTF image is associated with multiple labels/spots. The\nlocalization is performed with a training stage and a localization stage. In\nthe training stage, the CSI based MLTF images are constructed with single\ntarget at each location. The constructed images are used to train the CNN via a\ngradient based optimization algorithm. In the localization stage, the test MLTF\nimage obtained for targets at multiple spots is fed to the CNN network and\nlocations of the targets are calculated using sigmoid activation function in\nthe output layer under the multi label classification framework. Extensive\nexperiments are conducted to select appropriate parameters for the CNN\narchitecture as well as for the system design. The experimental results\ndemonstrate the superior performance of CoMuTe over existing multi target\nlocalization approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Mar 2020 02:38:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-13"}

However, the fixed-point\niterations can converge very slowly, or not at all, if the elastic properties\nhave high contrast, such as in the case of voids. The paper examines the\nreasons for slow, or lack of convergence, in terms of a variational\nperspective. In particular, when the material contains regions with zero or\nvery small stiffness, there is lack of uniqueness, and the energy landscape has\nflat or shallow directions. Therefore, in this work, the fixed-point iteration\nis replaced by the RPM iteration. The RPM uses the fixed-point iteration to\nadaptively identify the subspace on which fixed-point iterations are unstable,\nand performs Newton iterations only on the unstable subspace, while fixed-point\niterations are performed on the complementary stable subspace. This combination\nof efficient fixed-point iterations where possible, and expensive but\nwell-convergent Newton iterations where required, is shown to lead to robust\nand efficient convergence of the method. In particular, RPM-FFT converges well\nfor a wide range of choices of the reference medium, while usual fixed-point\niterations are usually sensitive to this choice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Mar 2020 15:10:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-18"}

However, assessment of learned image feature relationships\nwith variation in crude mortality rate across the United States has been\nlacking.\n  Objective: Investigate prediction of county-level mortality rates in the U.S.\nusing satellite images.\n  Design: Satellite images were extracted with the Google Static Maps\napplication programming interface for 430 counties representing approximately\n68.9% of the US population.
