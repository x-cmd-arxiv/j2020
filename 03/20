At the same time, it is often possible\nto train the agents in a centralised fashion where global state information is\navailable and communication constraints are lifted. Learning joint\naction-values conditioned on extra state information is an attractive way to\nexploit centralised learning, but the best strategy for then extracting\ndecentralised policies is unclear. Our solution is QMIX, a novel value-based\nmethod that can train decentralised policies in a centralised end-to-end\nfashion. QMIX employs a mixing network that estimates joint action-values as a\nmonotonic combination of per-agent values. We structurally enforce that the\njoint-action value is monotonic in the per-agent values, through the use of\nnon-negative weights in the mixing network, which guarantees consistency\nbetween the centralised and decentralised policies. To evaluate the performance\nof QMIX, we propose the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) as a new\nbenchmark for deep multi-agent reinforcement learning. We evaluate QMIX on a\nchallenging set of SMAC scenarios and show that it significantly outperforms\nexisting multi-agent reinforcement learning methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Mar 2020 16:51:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 2020 13:45:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-22"}

On the\ndefense side, there have been intensive efforts on improving both empirical and\nprovable robustness against evasion attacks; however, the provable robustness\nagainst backdoor attacks still remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we\nfocus on certifying the machine learning model robustness against general\nthreat models, especially backdoor attacks. We first provide a unified\nframework via randomized smoothing techniques and show how it can be\ninstantiated to certify the robustness against both evasion and backdoor\nattacks. We then propose the first robust training process, RAB, to smooth the\ntrained model and certify its robustness against backdoor attacks. We prove the\nrobustness bound for machine learning models trained with RAB and prove that\nour robustness bound is tight. In addition, we theoretically show that it is\npossible to train the robust smoothed models efficiently for simple models such\nas K-nearest neighbor classifiers, and we propose an exact smooth-training\nalgorithm that eliminates the need to sample from a noise distribution for such\nmodels. Empirically, we conduct comprehensive experiments for different machine\nlearning (ML) models such as DNNs, support vector machines, and K-NN models on\nMNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNette datasets and provide the first benchmark for\ncertified robustness against backdoor attacks. In addition, we evaluate K-NN\nmodels on a spambase tabular dataset to demonstrate the advantages of the\nproposed exact algorithm.

In many applications\nit is often essential to test the ability of an individual node to control a\nspecific target subset of the network. In biological networks, this might\nprovide precious information on how single genes regulate the expression of\nspecific groups of molecules in the cell. Taking into account these\nconstraints, we propose an optimized heuristic based on the Kalman rank\ncondition to quantify the centrality of a node as the number of target nodes it\ncan control. By introducing a hierarchy among the nodes in the target set, and\nperforming a step-wise research, we ensure for sparse and directed networks the\nidentification of a controllable driver-target configuration in a significantly\nreduced space and time complexity. We show how the method works for simple\nnetwork configurations, then we use it to characterize the inflammatory\npathways in molecular gene networks associated with macrophage dysfunction in\npatients with multiple sclerosis. Results indicate that the targeted secreted\nmolecules can in general be controlled by a large number of driver nodes (51%)\ninvolved in different cell functions, i.e. sensing, signaling and\ntranscription. However, during the inflammatory response only a moderate\nfraction of all the possible driver-target pairs are significantly coactivated,\nas measured by gene expression data obtained from human blood samples. Notably,\nthey differ between multiple sclerosis patients and healthy controls, and we\nfind that this is related to the presence of dysregulated genes along the\ncontrollable walks. Our method, that we name step-wise target controllability,\nrepresents a practical solution to identify controllable driver-target\nconfigurations in directed complex networks and test their relevance from a\nfunctional perspective.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Mar 2020 17:24:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Mar 2020 14:54:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 2020 10:12:25 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 7 Dec 2020 14:01:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-08"}

Therefore, the Mn/Cr mass ratio with its neutron excess\nreflects the neutronization at the relevant burning layer during the explosion.\nChandra's archival X-ray data of Cassiopeia A indicate a low Mn/Cr mass ratio\nwith values in the range 0.10--0.66, which, when compared to one-dimensional SN\nexplosion models, requires that the electron fraction be 0.4990 $\\lesssim\nY_{\\rm e} \\lesssim$ 0.5 at the incomplete Si burning layer.

The phase-lag behaviour of the subharmonic of the QPO is similar to\nthat of the QPO fundamental, where the subharmonic lags decrease with\nsubharmonic frequency and change sign from positive to negative at a\nsubharmonic frequency of ~1 Hz; on the contrary, the second harmonic of the QPO\nshows a quite different phase-lag behaviour, where all the second harmonics\nshow hard lags that remain more or less constant.

CC SNe were selected for the\ninitial development phase as they are known to be difficult to classify, with\nthe expectation that any learning techniques for them should be at least as\neffective for other transients. We demonstrate the behavior of REFITT on a\nrandom LSST night given ~32000 live CC SNe of interest. The system makes good\npredictions for the photometric behavior of the events and uses them to plan\nfollow-up using a simple data-driven metric. We argue that machine-directed\nfollow-up maximizes the scientific potential of surveys and follow-up resources\nby reducing downtime and bias in data collection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Mar 2020 18:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Jun 2020 18:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 25 Jul 2020 01:19:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-28"}

We present a detailed analysis of star\nformation histories (SFHs) and chemical enrichment of stellar populations in\nnine nearby barred galaxies from the TIMER project. We use integral field\nobservations with the MUSE instrument to derive unprecedented spatially\nresolved maps of stellar ages, metallicities, [Mg/Fe] abundances and SFHs, as\nwell as H$\\alpha$ as a tracer of ongoing star formation. We find a\ncharacteristic V-shaped signature in the SFH perpendicular to the bar major\naxis which supports the scenario where intermediate age stars ($\\sim 2$-$6\\\n\\mathrm{Gyr}$) are trapped on more elongated orbits shaping a thinner part of\nthe bar, while older stars ($> 8\\ \\mathrm{Gyr}$) are trapped on less elongated\norbits shaping a rounder and thicker part of the bar. We compare our data to\nstate-of-the-art cosmological magneto-hydrodynamical simulations of barred\ngalaxies and show that such V-shaped SFHs arise naturally due to the dynamical\ninfluence of the bar on stellar populations with different ages and kinematic\nproperties. Additionally, we find an excess of very young stars ($< 2\\\n\\mathrm{Gyr}$) on the edges of the bars, predominantly on the leading side,\nconfirming typical star formation patterns in bars. Furthermore, mass-weighted\nage and metallicity gradients are slightly shallower along the bar than in the\ndisc likely due to orbital mixing in the bar. Finally, we find that bars are\nmostly more metal-rich and less [Mg/Fe]-enhanced than the surrounding discs. We\ninterpret this as a signature that the bar quenches star formation in the inner\nregion of discs, usually referred to as star formation deserts. We discuss\nthese results and their implications on two different scenarios of bar\nformation and evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Mar 2020 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-20"}

While operating on\ndeck, the SP seismometer showed signals comparable to the Viking-2 seismometer\nnear 3 Hz where the sensitivity of the Viking instrument peaked. Wind\nsensitivity showed similar patterns to the Viking instrument, although\namplitudes on InSight were ~80% larger for a given wind velocity. However,\nduring the low wind evening hours the instrument noise levels at frequencies\nbetween 0.1 and 1 Hz were comparable to quiet stations on Earth, although\ndeployment to the surface below the Wind and Thermal Shield lowered\ninstallation noise by roughly 40 dB in acceleration power. With the observed\nnoise levels and estimated seismicity rates for Mars, detection probability for\nquakes for a deck-mounted instrument are low enough that up to years of on-deck\nrecordings may be necessary to observe an event. Because the noise is dominated\nby wind acting on the lander, though, deck-mounted seismometers may be more\npractical for deployment on airless bodies, and it is important to evaluate the\nseismicity of the target body and the specific design of the lander. Detection\nprobabilities for operation on Europa reach over 99% for some proposed\nseismicity models for a similar duration of operation if noise levels are\ncomparable to low-wind time periods on Mars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Mar 2020 18:07:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-21"}

Here, we study the\nformation of liquid bridges induced by confining colloids to a slit, with the\nslit walls having a preference opposite to the one of the colloid surface.\nUsing mean field theory, we show that there is a line of first-order phase\ntransitions between the bridge and the no-bridge states, which ends at a\ncritical point. By decreasing the slit width, this critical point is shifted\ntowards smaller separations between the colloids. However, at very small\nseparations, and far from criticality, we observe only a minor influence of the\nslit width on the location of the transition. Monte Carlo simulations of the\nIsing model, which mimics incompressible binary liquid mixtures, confirm the\noccurrence of the bridging transitions, as manifested by the appearance of\nbistable regions where both the bridge and the no-bridge configurations are\n(meta)stable. Interestingly, we find no bistability in the case of small\ncolloids, but we observe a sharpening of the transition when the colloid size\nincreases. In addition, we demonstrate that the capillary force acting between\nthe colloids can depend sensitively on the slit width, and varies drastically\nwith temperature, thus achieving strengths orders of magnitude higher than at\ncriticality of the fluid.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Mar 2020 18:49:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}

We aim to investigate the mass discrepancy in binary\nstars. We study the effect of near-core mixing on the mass of the convective\ncore of the stars and interpret the results in the context of the mass\ndiscrepancy. Two scenarios are considered, where individual stellar components\nof a binary system are treated independent of each other and where they are\nforced to have the same age and initial chemical composition. We find that the\nmass discrepancy is present in our sample and that it is anti-correlated with\nthe surface gravity of the star. No correlations are found with other\nfundamental and atmospheric parameters, including the stellar mass. The mass\ndiscrepancy can be partially accounted for by increasing the amount of\nnear-core mixing in stellar evolution models. We also find that ignoring the\nmicroturbulent velocity and turbulent pressure in stellar atmosphere models of\nhot evolved stars results in overestimation of their effective temperature by\nup to 8%. Together with enhanced near-core mixing, this can almost entirely\naccount for the 30% mass discrepancy found for the evolved primary component of\nV380 Cyg. We find a strong link between the mass discrepancy and the convective\ncore mass. The mass discrepancy can be solved by considering the combined\neffect of extra near-core boundary mixing and consistent treatment in the\nspectrum analysis of hot evolved stars. Our binary modelling results in\nconvective core masses between 17 and 35% of the stellar mass, in excellent\nagreement with results from gravity-mode asteroseismology of single stars.

The standard\ncross-entropy loss for classification has been largely overlooked in DML. On\nthe surface, the cross-entropy may seem unrelated and irrelevant to metric\nlearning as it does not explicitly involve pairwise distances. However, we\nprovide a theoretical analysis that links the cross-entropy to several\nwell-known and recent pairwise losses. Our connections are drawn from two\ndifferent perspectives: one based on an explicit optimization insight; the\nother on discriminative and generative views of the mutual information between\nthe labels and the learned features. First, we explicitly demonstrate that the\ncross-entropy is an upper bound on a new pairwise loss, which has a structure\nsimilar to various pairwise losses: it minimizes intra-class distances while\nmaximizing inter-class distances. As a result, minimizing the cross-entropy can\nbe seen as an approximate bound-optimization (or Majorize-Minimize) algorithm\nfor minimizing this pairwise loss. Second, we show that, more generally,\nminimizing the cross-entropy is actually equivalent to maximizing the mutual\ninformation, to which we connect several well-known pairwise losses.\nFurthermore, we show that various standard pairwise losses can be explicitly\nrelated to one another via bound relationships. Our findings indicate that the\ncross-entropy represents a proxy for maximizing the mutual information -- as\npairwise losses do -- without the need for convoluted sample-mining heuristics.\nOur experiments over four standard DML benchmarks strongly support our\nfindings.

The main objective of this study,\ntherefore, is to evaluate the efficiency of EMA, in combination with universal\npower-law scaling from percolation theory, in estimating gas relative\npermeability from pore size distribution and pore connectivity. We presume that\ngas flow is mainly controlled by two main mechanisms contributing in parallel\n(1) hydraulic flow and (2) molecular flow.

Comparisons with two pore-network simulations and six\nexperimental measurements from the literature show that, in the absence of\nmicrofractures, the proposed model estimates gas relative permeability\nreasonably well in shales and tight porous rocks. More specifically, we found\nthat the crossover point, gas saturation at which transport crosses from\npercolation theory to the EMA, is non-universal. The value of crossover gas\nsaturation is a function of pore space characteristics such as pore size\ndistribution broadness and critical gas saturation. This means that one should\nexpect the crossover gas saturation to vary from one rock sample to another.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Mar 2020 19:06:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-08"}

The central challenge is to find an explanation which is more\ncomprehensible than the original model while still representing that model\nfaithfully. The distributed nature of deep networks has led many to believe\nthat the hidden features of a neural network cannot be explained by logical\ndescriptions simple enough to be comprehensible. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel layerwise knowledge extraction method using M-of-N rules which seeks to\nobtain the best trade-off between the complexity and accuracy of rules\ndescribing the hidden features of a deep network. We show empirically that this\napproach produces rules close to an optimal complexity-error tradeoff. We apply\nthis method to a variety of deep networks and find that in the internal layers\nwe often cannot find rules with a satisfactory complexity and accuracy,\nsuggesting that rule extraction as a general purpose method for explaining the\ninternal logic of a neural network may be impossible.

The velocity of fluid inside\nthe droplets was investigated by confocal micro-PIV technique. Condensation on\nthe droplets was carried out inside a closed chamber by creating a difference\nin vapor pressure between the droplet interface and a reservoir fluid\nsurrounding the droplet in the room temperature without any cooling.\nCondensation on the droplet leads to spatial variation of solute concentration\ninside the droplet causing buoyancy driven Rayleigh convection. Fluid flow\npattern inside a single condensing droplet is symmetric in nature where as the\nfluid flow pattern for two interacting droplets is asymmetric in nature. The\nneighboring droplet influences the internal convection through vapor mediated\ninteraction between the two condensing droplets. Here, the condensing droplet\nsenses the neighboring droplet from a distance without any physical contact.\nThe asymmetric nature of the flow pattern is attributed to the modification in\nthe distribution of condensation flux of the droplet in the presence of the\nneighboring droplet.

All the provinces show a clear and consistent pattern of slowing down\nwith growing exponent going nearly zero, so it can be said that the epidemic\nwas contained in China. On the other side, the more recent spread in countries\nlike, Italy, Iran, and Spain show a clear exponential growth, as well as other\nEuropean countries. Even more recently, US -which was one of the first\ncountries to have an individual infected outside China (Jan 21st, 2020)- seems\nto follow the same path. We calculate the exponential growth of the most\naffected countries, showing the evolution along time after the first local\ncase. We identify clearly different patterns in the analyzed data and we give\ninterpretations and possible explanations for them. The analysis and\nconclusions of our study can help countries that, after importing some cases,\nare not yet in the local spreading phase, or have just started.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Mar 2020 22:22:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-23"}

This work presents a\nnoise-robust learning-based method to predict RSP maps from DECT for proton\nradiation therapy. Methods: The proposed method uses a residual attention\ncycle-consistent generative adversarial (CycleGAN) network. CycleGAN were used\nto let the DECT-to-RSP mapping be close to a one-to-one mapping by introducing\nan inverse RSP-to-DECT mapping.

In the real-world\nscenarios, it is common that some attributes of items/users are missing (e.g.,\nsome movies miss the genre data). Prior studies usually use a default value\n(i.e., \"other\") to represent the missing attribute, resulting in sub-optimal\nperformance. To address this problem, in this paper, we present an\nattribute-aware attentive graph convolution network (A${^2}$-GCN). In\nparticular, we first construct a graph, whereby users, items, and attributes\nare three types of nodes and their associations are edges. Thereafter, we\nleverage the graph convolution network to characterize the complicated\ninteractions among <users, items, attributes>. To learn the node\nrepresentation, we turn to the message-passing strategy to aggregate the\nmessage passed from the other directly linked types of nodes (e.g., a user or\nan attribute). To this end, we are capable of incorporating associate\nattributes to strengthen the user and item representations, and thus naturally\nsolve the attribute missing problem. Considering the fact that for different\nusers, the attributes of an item have different influence on their preference\nfor this item, we design a novel attention mechanism to filter the message\npassed from an item to a target user by considering the attribute information.\nExtensive experiments have been conducted on several publicly accessible\ndatasets to justify our model.

Recently, a family of Targeted Essentially\nNon-Oscillatory (TENO) schemes are developed to fulfill such requirements.\nAlthough TENO has very low dissipation for smooth flow, it introduces a cutoff\nvalue $C_T$ to maintain the non-oscillatory shock-capturing property. $C_T$ is\nproblem depended and therefore needs adjustments by trial and error for\ndifferent problems. As $C_T$ actually controls the dissipation property of\nTENO, the choice of $C_T$ for better shock-capturing capability always means\nhigher dissipation. To overcome this, in this paper, a local adaptive method is\nproposed for the choice of $C_T$. By introducing a novel adaptive function\nbased on the WENO smoothness indicators, $C_T$ is dynamically adjusted form\n$1.0 \\times 10.0^{-10}$ for lower dissipation to $1.0 \\times 10.0^{-4}$ for\nbetter capturing of shock according to the smoothness of the reconstruction\nstencil. Numerical results of the new method are compared with those of the\noriginal TENO method and the TENO-A method (Fu et al., JCP, 2017). It reveals\nthat the new method is capable of better suppressing numerical oscillations\nnear discontinuities while maintaining the low dissipation property of TENO at\nlower extra computational cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Mar 2020 08:34:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-02"}

Previous work seeks to plainly align image-level and instance-level\nshifts to eventually minimize the domain discrepancy. However, they still\noverlook to match crucial image regions and important instances across domains,\nwhich will strongly affect domain shift mitigation. In this work, we propose a\nsimple but effective categorical regularization framework for alleviating this\nissue. It can be applied as a plug-and-play component on a series of Domain\nAdaptive Faster R-CNN methods which are prominent for dealing with domain\nadaptive detection. Specifically, by integrating an image-level multi-label\nclassifier upon the detection backbone, we can obtain the sparse but crucial\nimage regions corresponding to categorical information, thanks to the weakly\nlocalization ability of the classification manner. Meanwhile, at the instance\nlevel, we leverage the categorical consistency between image-level predictions\n(by the classifier) and instance-level predictions (by the detection head) as a\nregularization factor to automatically hunt for the hard aligned instances of\ntarget domains. Extensive experiments of various domain shift scenarios show\nthat our method obtains a significant performance gain over original Domain\nAdaptive Faster R-CNN detectors.

However, such rules often fail to be anonymous, or impose specific\nrestrictions on the number of voters and candidates. These issues can be\naddressed by considering the proportional veto core -- the solution to a\ncooperative game where every coalition is given the power to veto a number of\ncandidates proportional to its size.

The Common\nbuzzard (Buteo buteo) is a highly aggressive, territorial bird of prey that\ninteracts strongly with its intra- and interspecific competitors. We propose\nand use random matrix theory to quantify the strength and range of repulsion as\na function of the buzzard population density, thus providing a novel approach\nto model density dependence. As an indicator of territorial behaviour, we\nperform a large-scale analysis of the distribution of buzzard nests in an area\nof $300$ square kilometres around the Teutoburger Wald, Germany, as gathered\nover a period of $20$ years. The nearest and next-to-nearest neighbour spacing\ndistribution between nests is compared to the two-dimensional Poisson\ndistribution, originating from uncorrelated random variables, to the complex\neigenvalues of random matrices, which are strongly correlated, and to a\ntwo-dimensional Coulomb gas interpolating between these two. A one-parameter\nfit to a time-moving average reveals a significant increase of repulsion\nbetween neighbouring nests, as a function of the observed increase in absolute\npopulation density over the monitored period of time, thereby proving an\nunexpected yet simple model for density-dependent spacing of predator\nterritories.

In the standard case of\nthe Schmidt number (ratio of the effective viscosity to diffusivity) Sc = 1,\nthe reduced description of RDI in terms of the inertial wave (IW) and the\nstreaming dust wave (SDW) falling in resonance with each other reveals that\ndamping solution differs from the inviscid solution simply by adding the\ncharacteristic damping frequency to its growth rate. RDI is fully suppressed at\nthe threshold viscosity, which is estimated analytically, first, for radial\ndrift, next, for vertical settling of dust, and at last, in the case of\nsettling combined with radial drift of the dust. In the last case, RDI survives\nup to the highest threshold viscosity, with a greater excess for smaller\nsolids. Once Sc \\neq 1, a new instability specific for dissipative\nperturbations on the dust settling background emerges. This instability of the\nquasi-resonant nature is referred to as settling viscous instability (SVI). The\nmode akin to SDW (IW) becomes growing in a region of long waves provided that\nSc > 1 (Sc < 1). SVI leads to an additional increase of the threshold\nviscosity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Mar 2020 11:48:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-01"}

Thus in this\nwork, we make contributions to shock capturing schemes on unstructured grids\nwith aim of resolving discontinuities with low numerical dissipation. Different\nfrom conventional shock capturing schemes which only use polynomials as\ninterpolation functions on unstructured grids, the proposed scheme employs the\nlinear polynomial as well as non-polynomial as reconstruction candidates. For\nlinear polynomial, the second order MUSCL scheme with the MLP\n(Multi-dimensional Limiting Process) slope limiter is adopted. The\nmulti-dimensional THINC (Tangent of Hyperbola for INterface Capturing) function\nwith quadratic surface representation and Gaussian quadrature, so-called\nTHINC/QQ, is used as the non-polynomial reconstruction candidate. With these\nreconstruction candidates, a multi-stage boundary variation diminishing (BVD)\nalgorithm which aims to minimize numerical dissipation is designed on\nunstructured grids to select the final reconstruction function. The resulted\nshock capturing scheme is named as MUSCL-THINC/QQ-BVD. The performance of the\nproposed scheme is demonstrated through solving compressible single-phase and\nmulti-phase problems where the discontinuity is the typical flow structure. The\nnumerical results show that the proposed scheme is capable of capturing sharp\ndiscontinuous profiles without numerical oscillations as well as resolving\nvortices associated with Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities along shear layers and\nmaterial interfaces. In comparison with schemes only replying on high order\npolynomials, the proposed scheme shows significant improvement of resolution\nacross discontinuities.

The panel is taken to be embedded in the boundary of a linear,\nsubsonic potential flow on the positive halfspace in $\\mathbb R^3$. Solutions\nare constructed via a semigroup approach despite the lack of natural\ndissipativity associated to the generator of the linear dynamics. The\nflow-plate dynamics are then reduced---via an explicit Neumann-to-Dirichlet\n(downwash-to-pressure) solver for the flow---to a memory-type dynamical system\nfor the plate. For the non-conservative plate dynamics, a global attractor is\nexplicitly constructed via Lyapunov and quasi-stability methods. Finally, it is\nshown that via the compactness of the attractor and finiteness of the\ndissipation integral, that all trajectories converge strongly to the set of\nstationary states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Mar 2020 12:39:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-23"}

The main goal is to deduce a fully\nguaranteed upper bound of the difference between the exact minimizer u and any\nfunction (approximation) from the corresponding energy class (which consists of\nthe functions in $H^2$ satisfying the prescribed boundary conditions and the\nrestrictions stipulated by the obstacle). For this purpose we use the duality\nmethod of the calculus of variations and general type error identities earlier\nderived for a wide class of convex variational problems. By this method, we\ndefine a combined primal--dual measure of error. It contains four terms of\ndifferent nature. Two of them are the norms of the difference between the exact\nsolutions (of the direct and dual variational problems) and corresponding\napproximations. Two others are nonlinear measures, related to approximation of\nthe coincidence set (they vanish if the coincidence set defined by means of the\napproximate solution coincides with the exact one). The measure satisfies the\nerror identity, which right hand side depends on approximate solutions only\nand, therefore, is fully computable. Thus, the identity provides direct\nestimation of the primal--dual errors. However, it contains a certain\nrestriction on the form of the dual approximation. In the second part of the\npaper, we present a way to skip the restriction. As a result, we obtain a fully\nguaranteed and directly computable error majorant valid for a wide class of\napproximations regardless of the method used for their construction. The\nestimates are verified in a series of tests with different approximate\nsolutions.

Nevertheless, Q-Learning is\nknown to be positively biased since it learns by using the maximum over noisy\nestimates of expected values. Systematic overestimation of the action values\ncoupled with the inherently high variance of DRL methods can lead to\nincrementally accumulate errors, causing learning algorithms to diverge.\nIdeally, we would like DRL agents to take into account their own uncertainty\nabout the optimality of each action, and be able to exploit it to make more\ninformed estimations of the expected return. In this regard, Weighted\nQ-Learning (WQL) effectively reduces bias and shows remarkable results in\nstochastic environments. WQL uses a weighted sum of the estimated action\nvalues, where the weights correspond to the probability of each action value\nbeing the maximum; however, the computation of these probabilities is only\npractical in the tabular setting. In this work, we provide methodological\nadvances to benefit from the WQL properties in DRL, by using neural networks\ntrained with Dropout as an effective approximation of deep Gaussian processes.\nIn particular, we adopt the Concrete Dropout variant to obtain calibrated\nestimates of epistemic uncertainty in DRL. The estimator, then, is obtained by\ntaking several stochastic forward passes through the action-value network and\ncomputing the weights in a Monte Carlo fashion.

Methods: We designed a\ntransmit-receive RF coil with $8$ decoupled channels for $7$T head imaging. We\ncalculated the RF transmit field ($B_1^+$) inside heterogeneous head models for\ndifferent RF shimming approaches, and used them as input for GMT to reconstruct\nEP for all voxels. Results: Coil tuning/decoupling remained relatively stable\nwhen the coil was loaded with different head models.

The transition from a hydrogen-rich to\na hydrogen-poor envelope is potentially observable in accreting NS systems as\nan additional initial decline in surface temperature at early times after the\noutburst. Second, we find that DNB can produce a non-negligible heat flux, such\nthat the total luminosity can be dominated by DNB in the envelope rather than\nheat from the deep interior. However, without continual accretion, heating by\nDNB in H-C envelopes is only relevant for <1-80 days after the end of an\naccretion outburst, as the amount of light elements is rapidly depleted.\nComparison to crust cooling data shows that DNB does not remove the need for an\nadditional shallow heating source. We conclude that solving the time-dependent\nequations of the burning region in the envelope self-consistently in thermal\nevolution models instead of using static temperature relations would be\nvaluable in future cooling studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Mar 2020 14:57:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-23"}

Prior hidden information detection schemes are either\nheuristicbased or Machine Learning (ML) based. The key limitation of prior\nheuristics-based schemes is that they do not answer the fundamental question of\nwhy the information hidden at a 2D barcode can be detected. The key limitation\nof prior MLbased information schemes is that they lack robustness because a\nprinted 2D barcode is very much environmentally dependent, and thus an\ninformation hiding detection scheme trained in one environment often does not\nwork well in another environment. In this paper, we propose two hidden\ninformation detection schemes at the existing anti-copying 2D barcodes. The\nfirst scheme is to directly use the pixel distance to detect the use of an\ninformation hiding scheme in a 2D barcode, referred as to the Pixel Distance\nBased Detection (PDBD) scheme. The second scheme is first to calculate the\nvariance of the raw signal and the covariance between the recovered signal and\nthe raw signal, and then based on the variance results, detects the use of\ninformation hiding scheme in a 2D barcode, referred as to the Pixel Variance\nBased Detection (PVBD) scheme. Moreover, we design advanced IC attacks to\nevaluate the security of two existing anti-copying 2D barcodes. We implemented\nour schemes and conducted extensive performance comparison between our schemes\nand prior schemes under different capturing devices, such as a scanner and a\ncamera phone. Our experimental results show that the PVBD scheme can correctly\ndetect the existence of the hidden information at both the 2LQR code and the\nLCAC 2D barcode.

Recent theoretical studies have suggested\nthat the dust scattering at the millimeter wavelength potentially reduces the\nobserved intensity, which results in an underestimate in the dust mass. We\ninvestigate whether the dust scattering indeed reduces the observed continuum\nintensity by comparing the ALMA archival data of the TW Hya disk at Band 3, 4,\n6, 7 and 9 to models obtained by radiative transfer simulations. We find that\nthe model with scattering by 300 ${\\rm \\mu m}$-sized grains well reproduces the\nobserved SED of the central part of the TW Hya disk while the model without\nscattering is also consistent within the errors of the absolute fluxes. To\nexplain the intensity at Band 3, the dust surface density needs to be $\\sim$ 10\n${\\rm g\\,cm^{-2}}$ at 10 au in the model with scattering, which is 26 times\nmore massive than previously predicted. The model without scattering needs 2.3\ntimes higher dust mass than the model with scattering because it needs lower\ntemperature. At Band 7, scattering reduces the intensity by $\\sim$ 35% which\nmakes the disk looks optically thin even though it is optically thick.

Owing to the compactness of this binary, emission of non-thermal\nX-ray photons via inverse Compton scattering is expected. We first revised the\norbital solution for Cyg OB2 #8a using new optical spectra. We then reduced and\nanalysed X-ray spectra obtained with XMM-Newton, Swift, INTEGRAL, and NuSTAR.\nThe analysis of the XMM-Newton and Swift data allows us to better characterise\nthe X-ray emission from the stellar winds and colliding winds region at\nenergies below 10 keV. We confirm the variation of the broad-band light curve\nof Cyg OB2 #8a along the orbit with, for the first time, the observation of the\nmaximum emission around phase 0.8. The minimum ratio of the X-ray to bolometric\nflux of Cyg OB2 #8a remains well above the level expected for single O-type\nstars, indicating that the colliding wind region is not disrupted during the\nperiastron passage. The analysis of the full set of publicly available INTEGRAL\nobservations allows us to refine the upper limit on the non-thermal X-ray flux\nof the Cyg OB2 region between 20 and 200 keV. Two NuSTAR observations (phases\n0.028 and 0.085) allow us to study the Cyg OB2 #8a spectrum up to 30 keV. These\ndata do not provide evidence of the presence of non-thermal X-rays, but bring\nmore stringent constraints on the flux of a putative non-thermal component.\nFinally, we computed, thanks to a new dedicated model, the anisotropic inverse\nCompton emission generated in the wind shock region. The theoretical\nnon-thermal emission appears to be compatible with observational limits and the\nkinetic luminosity computed from these models is in good agreement with the\nunabsorbed flux observed below 10 keV.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Mar 2020 13:55:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-29"}

Since H is necessarily a\nweakly chordal graph, we use an algorithm for deleting edges from a weakly\nchordal graph that preserves the weak chordality property of H. The edges that\nare candidates for deletion are the fill-edges that were inserted into G. In\norder to delete a maximal number of fill-edges, we maintain these in a queue. A\nfill-edge is removed from the front of the queue, which we then try to delete\nfrom H. If this violates the weak chordality property of H, we reinsert this\nedge at the back of the queue. This loop continues till no more fill-edges can\nbe removed from H. Operationally, we implement this by defining a deletion\nround as one in which the edge at the back of the queue is at the front.We stop\nwhen the size of the queue does not change over two successive deletion rounds\nand output H.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Mar 2020 02:45:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-01"}

Contrarily to the\nclassical Boussinesq-type models, it contains only first order derivatives,\nthus allowing to overcome the numerical difficulties and the severe time step\nrestrictions arising from higher order terms. The proposed model reduces to the\noriginal SGN model when an artificial sound speed tends to infinity. Moreover,\nit is endowed with an energy conservation law from which the energy\nconservation law associated with the original SGN model is retrieved when the\nartificial sound speed goes to infinity. The governing partial differential\nequations are then solved at the aid of high order ADER discontinuous Galerkin\nfinite element schemes. The new model has been successfully validated against\nnumerical and experimental results, for both flat and non-flat bottom.

During the training of a deep neural network, the annotated samples are\nfed into the network in a mini-batch way, where they are often regarded of\nequal importance. However, some of the samples may become less informative\nduring training, as the magnitude of the gradient start to vanish for these\nsamples. In the meantime, other samples of higher utility or hardness may be\nmore demanded for the training process to proceed and require more\nexploitation. To address the challenges of expensive annotations and loss of\nsample informativeness, here we propose a novel training framework which\nadaptively selects informative samples that are fed to the training process.\nThe adaptive selection or sampling is performed based on a hardness-aware\nstrategy in the latent space constructed by a generative model. To evaluate the\nproposed training framework, we perform experiments on three different\ndatasets, including MNIST and CIFAR-10 for image classification task and a\nmedical image dataset IVUS for biophysical simulation task. On all three\ndatasets, the proposed framework outperforms a random sampling method, which\ndemonstrates the effectiveness of proposed framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 19 Mar 2020 22:17:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 12 Apr 2020 18:25:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-14"}

The main idea is to describe\nanalytically the problem along the angular coordinates with spherical harmonics\nand to discretize the radial direction with one-dimensional finite elements.\nThe proper test function must be carefully chosen so that both vector and\ntensor spherical harmonics orthogonality relationships can be used. The\nproposed approach yields a general one-dimensional formulation with a fully\nanalytical description of the angular behaviour, suitable for any interpolating\ntechnique. A linear eigenvalue problem, simple and fast to solve, is then\nobtained. The eigensolutions are the spheroidal and torsional modes. They are\nfavourably compared with literature results for a homogeneous sphere. The\neigensolutions are superposed to compute explicitly the forced response. The\nlatter is used to reconstruct the propagation of surfaces waves. In particular,\nthe collimation of a Rayleigh wave (non-diffracted surface wave propagating\nwith a quasi-constant width) excited by a line source in a homogeneous sphere\nis recovered with the model. Based on the vibration eigenmodes, a modal\nanalysis shows that such a wave is a superposition of fundamental spheroidal\nmodes with a displacement confined at the equator of the sphere. These modes\nare the so-called Rayleigh modes, of sectoral type and high polar wavenumbers.\nWhen a thin viscoelastic coating is added to the sphere, the Rayleigh mode\nbehaviour is recovered in a limited frequency range, allowing the generation of\na collimating wave at the interface between the sphere and the coating.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 20 Mar 2020 14:57:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-27"}
