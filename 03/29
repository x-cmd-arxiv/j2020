For conventional interactions between fermionic particles\nsuch as electrons, the as-induced drag current in the passive layer is orders\nof magnitude weaker than the active current due to strong dielectric screening\neffect between the two. Here we propose a 'super' Coulomb drag effect between\nan active normal conductor and a passive superconductor of Josephson junction\narrays, whereby the passive current can greatly exceed the active. The drag\nforce originates from the interactions between the substantially enhanced\ndynamical quantum fluctuations of the superconducting phases in the passive\nlayer and the normal electrons in the active layer. We demonstrate this effect\nin the devices composed of monolayer graphene and LaAlO3/SrTiO3\nheterointerface, an inherently non-uniform superconductor described by\nJosephson junction arrays. Remarkable drag signal is observed in the\nsuperconducting transition regime of the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface, with its sign\nindependent of the carrier type in the graphene layer.

In\ndistribution fits for particle masses or couplings, however, signal events are\nnot all equivalent, as the signal differential cross section has different\nsensitivities to the measured parameter in different regions of phase space. In\nthis paper, I describe a mathematical framework for the evaluation and\noptimization of HEP parameter fits, where this sensitivity is defined on an\nevent-by-event basis, and for MC events it is modeled in terms of their MC\nweight derivatives with respect to the measured parameter. Minimising the\nstatistical error on a measurement implies the need to resolve (i.e. separate)\nevents with different sensitivities, which ultimately represents a\nnon-dichotomous classification problem. Since MC weight derivatives are not\navailable for real data, the practical strategy I suggest consists in training\na regressor of weight derivatives against MC events, and then using it as an\noptimal partitioning variable for 1-dimensional fits of data events.

The flaring\nplasma is well accounted for by a thick-target model of accelerated electrons\ncollisionally thermalizing within the loop, akin to the \"coronal thick target\"\nbehavior occasionally observed in larger flares. This is the first positive\ndetection of non-thermal hard X-rays from the Sun using a direct imager (as\nopposed to indirectly imaging instruments). The accelerated electron\ndistribution has a spectral index of 6.3 +/- 0.7, extends down to at least 6.5\nkeV, and deposits energy at a rate of ~2x1027 erg/s, heating the flare loop to\nat least 10 MK. The existence of dominant non-thermal emission in X-rays down\nto <5 keV means that RHESSI emission is almost entirely non-thermal, contrary\nto what is usually assumed in RHESSI spectroscopy. The ratio of non-thermal to\nthermal energies is similar to that of large flares, in contrast to what has\nbeen found in previous studies of small RHESSI flares. We suggest that a\ncoronal thick target may be a common property of many small microflares based\non the average electron energy and collisional mean free path.

Any potential\nsolution to the Hubble tension that works by altering the distance ladder must\nproduce consistency of both the Cepheid and TRGB $H_0$ calibrations with the\nCMB. In this paper we extend our models of screened fifth forces (Desmond et al\n2019) to cover the TRGB framework. A fifth force lowers TRGB luminosity, so a\nreduction in inferred $H_0$ requires that the stars that calibrate the\nluminosity---currently in the LMC---are on average less screened than those\nthat calibrate the supernova magnitude. We show that even under pessimistic\nassumptions for the extinction to the LMC, full consistency with Planck can be\nachieved for a fifth force strength in unscreened RGB stars $\\sim$0.2 that of\nNewtonian gravity. This is allowed by the comparison of Cepheid and TRGB\ndistance measurements to nearby galaxies.

These events are\nmigrated in suitable configurations for the new velocity model for which a\nraytracing set as required for a Kirchhoff prestack depth migration is\navailable. The resulting transformations can be utilized in various ways to\nestimate important parameters such as the positional bias of migrated events\nwith respect to the corresponding zero offset position and the residual moveout\nfor the new depth model ; finally a new approach is suggested to estimate the\naperture width over the Fresnel zone for the first prestack migration.

Reliably lifting accurate call graphs,\ncontrol flows, and data dependence graphs from binary code, as well as\nreconstructing object-oriented high-level concepts is a non-trivial task and\nthe choice of the lifted target representation determines the analysis\ncapabilities. None of the various existing intermediate representations is a\nperfect fit for all types of analysis, while the detection of vulnerabilities\nrequires techniques ranging from simple pattern matching to complex\ninter-procedural data flow analyses.

The orchestration agent learns the resource demands of network slices\nand orchestrates the resource allocation accordingly to optimize the\nperformance of the slices under the constrained networking and computing\nresources. We design radio, transport and computing manager to enable dynamic\nconfiguration of end-to-end resources at runtime. We implement EdgeSlice on a\nprototype of the end-to-end wireless edge computing network with\nOpenAirInterface LTE network, OpenDayLight SDN switches, and CUDA GPU platform.\nThe performance of EdgeSlice is evaluated through both experiments and\ntrace-driven simulations. The evaluation results show that EdgeSlice achieves\nmuch improvement as compared to baseline in terms of performance, scalability,\ncompatibility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Mar 2020 23:30:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-31"}

Recent study shows\nthat rigid foldability is affected by the mountain-valley crease (M-V)\nassignment of an origami pattern. In this paper, we investigate the rigid\nfoldability of the square-twist origami pattern with diverse M-V assignments by\na kinematic method based on the motion transmission path. Four types of\nsquare-twist origami patterns are analyzed, among which two are found rigidly\nfoldable, while the other two are not. The explicit kinematic equations of the\nrigid cases are derived based on the kinematic equivalence between the rigid\norigami pattern and the closed-loop network of spherical 4R linkages. We also\npropose a crease-addition method to convert the rigid foldability of the\nnon-rigid patterns. The motion compatibility conditions of the modified\npatterns are checked, which verify the rigid foldability of the modified\npatterns. The kinematic analysis reveals the bifurcation behaviour of the\nmodified patterns.

The core idea of ODRM is,\nthat a directed roadmap can encode inherent properties of the environment which\nare useful when agents have to avoid each other in that same environment. Like\nProbabilistic Roadmaps (PRMs), ODRM's first step is generating samples from\nC-space. In a second step, ODRM optimizes vertex positions and edge directions\nby Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). This leads to emergent properties like\nedges parallel to walls and patterns similar to two-lane streets or\nroundabouts.

Using\nthe graphs generated by ODRM compared to a non-optimized graph significantly\nfewer agent-agent collisions happen. We evaluate our roadmap with both,\ncentralized and decentralized planners. Our experiments show that with ODRM\neven a simple centralized planner can solve problems with high numbers of\nagents that other multi-agent planners can not solve.

In order to address the impairments such as beam misalignments,\noutage loss, tracking inability, blockage, etc., an optimum value of the bmW\nmust be determined.

When\nautonomous systems consider the performance of accuracy and transferability,\nseveral AI methods, like adversarial learning, reinforcement learning (RL) and\nmeta-learning, show their powerful performance. Here, we review the\nlearning-based approaches in autonomous systems from the perspectives of\naccuracy and transferability. Accuracy means that a well-trained model shows\ngood results during the testing phase, in which the testing set shares a same\ntask or a data distribution with the training set. Transferability means that\nwhen a well-trained model is transferred to other testing domains, the accuracy\nis still good. Firstly, we introduce some basic concepts of transfer learning\nand then present some preliminaries of adversarial learning, RL and\nmeta-learning. Secondly, we focus on reviewing the accuracy or transferability\nor both of them to show the advantages of adversarial learning, like generative\nadversarial networks (GANs), in typical computer vision tasks in autonomous\nsystems, including image style transfer, image superresolution, image\ndeblurring/dehazing/rain removal, semantic segmentation, depth estimation,\npedestrian detection and person re-identification (re-ID). Then, we further\nreview the performance of RL and meta-learning from the aspects of accuracy or\ntransferability or both of them in autonomous systems, involving pedestrian\ntracking, robot navigation and robotic manipulation. Finally, we discuss\nseveral challenges and future topics for using adversarial learning, RL and\nmeta-learning in autonomous systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Mar 2020 04:50:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Apr 2020 02:27:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 25 May 2020 02:05:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-26"}

Our approach combines two\ndeforming autoencoders with the latest advances in the conditional generation.\nOn the one hand, we adopt the deforming autoencoder to disentangle identity and\npose representations. A strong prior in talking face videos is that each frame\ncan be encoded as two parts: one for video-specific identity and the other for\nvarious poses. Inspired by that, we utilize a multi-frame deforming autoencoder\nto learn a pose-invariant embedded face for each video. Meanwhile, a\nmulti-scale deforming autoencoder is proposed to extract pose-related\ninformation for each frame. On the other hand, the conditional generator allows\nfor enhancing fine details and overall reality. It leverages the disentangled\nfeatures to generate photo-realistic and pose-alike face images.

Accordingly, in this paper, we propose a Graph\nProperty Sensing Network (GPS-Net) that fully explores these three properties\nfor SGG. First, we propose a novel message passing module that augments the\nnode feature with node-specific contextual information and encodes the edge\ndirection information via a tri-linear model. Second, we introduce a node\npriority sensitive loss to reflect the difference in priority between nodes\nduring training. This is achieved by designing a mapping function that adjusts\nthe focusing parameter in the focal loss.

The goal is to formulate a\ndecentralized policy for each agent, in order to maximize the total cumulative\nreward over all agents, subject to option availability and inter-agent\ncommunication constraints. The problem formulation is motivated by applications\nin which a team of autonomous mobile robots cooperates to accomplish an\nexploration and exploitation task in an uncertain environment. Bandit locations\nare represented by vertices of the spatial graph. At any time, an agent's\noption consist of sampling the bandit at its current location, or traveling\nalong an edge of the spatial graph to a new bandit location. Communication\nconstraints are described by a directed, non-stationary, stochastic\ncommunication graph. At any time, agents may receive data only from their\ncommunication graph in-neighbors. For the case of a single agent on a fully\nconnected spatial graph, it is known that the expected regret for any optimal\npolicy is necessarily bounded below by a function that grows as the logarithm\nof time. A class of policies called upper confidence bound (UCB) algorithms\nasymptotically achieve logarithmic regret for the classical MAB problem.

As a point set, wald space\ncontains the previously developed Billera-Holmes-Vogtmann (BHV) tree space; it\nalso contains disconnected forests, like the edge-product (EP) space but\nwithout certain singularities of the EP space. We investigate two related\ngeometries on wald space. The first is the geometry of the Fisher information\nmetric of character distributions induced by the two-state symmetric Markov\nsubstitution process on each tree. Infinitesimally, the metric is proportional\nto the Kullback-Leibler divergence, or equivalently, as we show, any to f\n-divergence. The second geometry is obtained analogously but using a related\ncontinuous-valued Gaussian process on each tree, and it can be viewed as the\ntrace metric of the affine-invariant metric for covariance matrices. We derive\na gradient descent algorithm to project from the ambient space of covariance\nmatrices to wald space. For both geometries we derive computational methods to\ncompute geodesics in polynomial time and show numerically that the two\ninformation geometries (discrete and continuous) are very similar. In\nparticular geodesics are approximated extrinsically.

Instead of training K inaccurate sub-models, each of them can\nrepresent various phases of training (representing various local minima of the\nloss function) of a single DNN [Huang et al., 2017; Gripov et al., 2018]. Thus,\nthe computational performance of the SuperNet can be comparable to the maximum\nCPU time spent on training its single sub-model, plus usually much shorter CPU\ntime required for training the SuperNet coupling factors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Mar 2020 13:47:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-31"}

Yet\nowing to its infinite complexity, scientists still debate how its central\nconcept, the photon, can be reconciled with the perceived existence of light\nwaves, emerging 200 years ago in the wake of Young's double slit diffraction\nexperiment. Ever since, the phenomenon of diffraction has been viewed to embody\nthe wave nature of light, leading to the schizophrenic wave-particle duality.\nThe latter does not exist in QED which is photon based without the existence of\nwaves. Here we introduce the new paradigm that diffraction images directly\nreflect the fundamental quantum states of light. This is revealed by analysis\nof the evolution of modern versions of Young's experiment performed with\ndifferently modified laser light and photon-based detection. In conventional\nquantum mechanics, corresponding to first order QED, the fundamental photon\nnature of light remains hidden since different quantum states produce only two\nbasic types of diffraction patterns that may also be explained by coherent and\nincoherent wave superposition. The true photon based substructure of light is\nshown to clearly emerge through characteristic diffraction images in second\norder QED. The degeneracy of the first order images is lifted, the\nwave-particle equivalence breaks down, and the patterns directly reveal the\ntrue quantum substructure of light. This allows the replacement of the\nconventional concept of wave coherence by a precise order-dependent degree of\ncoherence that quantifies the interference and diffraction behavior of all\nquantum states of light.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Mar 2020 22:34:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-01"}

Network slicing has been envisaged as an efficient\ntechnology to meet these diverse demands. In this paper, we propose a dynamic\nvirtual resources allocation scheme based on the radio access network (RAN)\nslicing for uplink communications to ensure the quality-of-service (QoS). To\nmaximum the weighted-sum transmission rate performance under delay constraint,\nformulate a joint optimization problem of subchannel allocation and power\ncontrol as an infinite-horizon average-reward constrained Markov decision\nprocess (CMDP) problem. Based on the equivalent Bellman equation, the optimal\ncontrol policy is first derived by the value iteration algorithm. However, the\noptimal policy suffers from the widely known curse-of-dimensionality problem.\nTo address this problem, the linear value function approximation (approximate\ndynamic programming) is adopted. Then, the subchannel allocation Q-factor is\ndecomposed into the per-slice Q-factor. Furthermore, the Q-factor and\nLagrangian multipliers are updated by the use of an online stochastic learning\nalgorithm. Finally, simulation results reveal that the proposed algorithm can\nmeet the delay requirements and improve the user transmission rate compared\nwith baseline schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Mar 2020 13:39:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-02"}

This is exemplified by using an\neffective many-body quantum potential which realizes quantum Slater sums by\nclassical calculations. It is shown that these quantum potentials avoid the\nquantum anomaly but approaches the same anomalous result by many-body\ncorrelations. A measure for the quality of quantum potentials is suggested to\ndescribe these quantum fluctuations in the mean energy. Consequently quantum\nanomalies might be a short-cut way of single-particle field theory to account\nfor many-body effects.
