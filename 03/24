In the present article we aim to assist the applied\nresearcher in understanding this assumption. Synthesizing what is known about\nthe cross-world independence assumption, we discuss the relationship between\nassumptions for causal mediation analyses, causal models, and non-parametric\nidentification of natural direct and indirect effects. In particular we give a\npractical example of an applied setting where the cross-world independence\nassumption is violated even without any post-treatment confounding. Further, we\nreview possible alternatives to the cross-world independence assumption,\nincluding the use of computation of bounds that avoid the assumption\naltogether. Finally, we carry out a numerical study in which the cross-world\nindependence assumption is violated to assess the ensuing bias in estimating\nnatural direct and indirect effects. We conclude with recommendations for\ncarrying out causal mediation analyses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Mar 2020 16:03:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Sep 2020 10:05:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-02"}

It has been shown\npreviously that such tubular structures allow for excitons delocalized over\nmore than a thousand molecules, owing to the combined effects of long-range\ndipole-dipole interactions and the higher-dimensional (not truly\none-dimensional) nature of the aggregate. Such large delocalization sizes\nprompt the question to what extent in experimental systems the delocalization\nmay still be determined by the aggregate size (diameter and length) and how\nthis affects the aggregate's optical response and dynamics. We perform a\nsystematic study of the size effects on the localization properties, using\nnumerical simulations of the exciton states in a cylindrical model structure\ninspired by the previously derived geometry of a cylindrical aggregate of\ncyanine dye molecules (C8S3). To characterize the exciton localization, we\ncalculate the participation ratio and the autocorrelation function of the\nexciton wave function. Also, we calculate the density of states and absorption\nspectrum. We find strong effects of the tube's radius on the localization and\noptical properties in the range of parameters relevant to experiment. In\naddition, surprisingly, we find that even for tubes as long as 750 nm, the\nlocalization size is limited by the tube's length for disorder values that are\nrelevant to experimental circumstances, while observable effects of the tube's\nlength in the absorption spectrum still occur for tube lengths up to about 150\nnm. The latter may explain changes in the optical spectra observed during the\naging process of bromine-substituted C8S3 aggregates. For weak disorder, the\nexciton wave functions exhibit a scattered, fractal-like nature, similar to the\nquasi-particles in two-dimensional disordered systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Mar 2020 16:16:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-24"}

Previously, non-additivity was known to occur in\nvery noisy channels with coherent information much smaller than that of a\nperfect channel; but, our work shows non-additivity in a simple low-noise\nchannel. Our results extend even further. We prove a general theorem concerning\npositivity of a channel's coherent information. A corollary of this theorem\ngives a simple dimensional test for a channel's capacity. Applying this\ncorollary solves an open problem by characterizing all qubit channels whose\ncomplement has non-zero capacity. Another application shows a wide class of\nzero quantum capacity qubit channels can assist an incomplete erasure channel\nin sending quantum information. These results arise from introducing and\nlinking logarithmic singularities in the von-Neumann entropy with quantum\ntransmission: changes in entropy caused by this singularity are a mechanism\nresponsible for both positivity and non-additivity of the coherent information.\nAnalysis of such singularities may be useful in other physics problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Mar 2020 16:32:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 Oct 2021 15:46:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-04"}

The validity of $1/N$ expansion with $N$ being\nthe fermion flavor is also in doubt since $N$ equals to $2$ or $4$ in realistic\nsystems. Here, we investigate the interaction between (1+2)- and\n(1+3)-dimensional massless Dirac fermions and a generic scalar boson, and\ndevelop an efficient non-perturbative approach to access the strong-coupling\nregime. We first derive a number of self-consistently coupled Ward-Takahashi\nidentities based on a careful symmetry analysis and then use these identities\nto show that the full fermion-boson vertex function is solely determined by the\nfull fermion propagator. Making use of this result, we rigorously prove that\nthe full fermion propagator satisfies an exact and self-closed Dyson-Schwinger\nintegral equation, which can be solved by employing numerical methods. A major\nadvantage of our non-perturbative approach is that there is no need to employ\nany small expansion parameter. Our approach provides a unified theoretical\nframework for studying strong Coulomb and fermion-phonon interactions.

In this\narticle, updates to the previously introduced method in Grale are described,\nand explored in a number of examples. The first looks into a different way of\nincorporating time delay information, not requiring the unknown source\nposition. It is found that this avoids a possible bias that leads to\n\"over-focusing\" the images, i.e. providing source position estimates that lie\nin a considerably smaller region than the true positions. The second is\ninspired by previous reconstructions of the cluster of galaxies MACS\nJ1149.6+2223, where a multiply-imaged background galaxy contained a supernova,\nSN Refsdal, of which four additional images were produced by the presence of a\nsmaller cluster galaxy. The inversion for the cluster as a whole, was not able\nto recover sufficient detail interior to this quad. We show how constraints on\nsuch different scales, from the entire cluster to a single member galaxy, can\nnow be used, allowing such small scale substructures to be resolved.

Second, we quantify the amount of\nadversarial accuracy with increased leak rate in Leaky-Integrate-Fire (LIF)\nneurons. Our results suggest that SNNs trained with LIF neurons and smaller\nnumber of timesteps are more robust than the ones with IF (Integrate-Fire)\nneurons and larger number of timesteps. Also we overcome the bottleneck of\ncreating gradient-based adversarial inputs in temporal domain by proposing a\ntechnique for crafting attacks from SNN\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Mar 2020 17:20:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Jul 2020 21:05:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-27"}

This paper studies a conceptually new method to alleviate the\nscale variance in semantic representation, named dynamic routing. The proposed\nframework generates data-dependent routes, adapting to the scale distribution\nof each image. To this end, a differentiable gating function, called soft\nconditional gate, is proposed to select scale transform paths on the fly. In\naddition, the computational cost can be further reduced in an end-to-end manner\nby giving budget constraints to the gating function. We further relax the\nnetwork level routing space to support multi-path propagations and\nskip-connections in each forward, bringing substantial network capacity. To\ndemonstrate the superiority of the dynamic property, we compare with several\nstatic architectures, which can be modeled as special cases in the routing\nspace.

The\nStewartson layer that lies on $\\mathcal{C}$ is composed of two nested shear\nlayers of thickness $O(E^{2/7})$ and $O(E^{1/3})$. We derive the lowest order\nsolution for the $E^{2/7}$-layer. A simple analysis of the $E^{1/3}$-layer\nlaying along the tangent cylinder, reveals it to be the site of an upwelling\nflow of amplitude $O(E^{1/3})$. Despite its narrowness, this shear layer\nconcentrates most of the global meridional kinetic energy of the spin-down\nflow. Furthermore, a stable stratification does not perturb the spin-down flow\nprovided the Prandtl number is small enough. If this is not the case, the\nStewartson layer disappears and meridional circulation is confined within the\nthermal layers. The scalings for the amplitude of the anelastic secondary flow\nhave been found to be the same as for the incompressible flow in all three\nregions, at the lowest order.

However,\nConditioned U-Net (C-U-Net) uses a control mechanism to train a single model\nfor multi-source separation and attempts to achieve a performance comparable to\nthat of the dedicated models. We propose a multi-channel U-Net (M-U-Net)\ntrained using a weighted multi-task loss as an alternative to the C-U-Net. We\ninvestigate two weighting strategies for our multi-task loss: 1) Dynamic\nWeighted Average (DWA), and 2) Energy Based Weighting (EBW). DWA determines the\nweights by tracking the rate of change of loss of each task during training.\nEBW aims to neutralize the effect of the training bias arising from the\ndifference in energy levels of each of the sources in a mixture. Our methods\nprovide three-fold advantages compared to C-UNet: 1) Fewer effective training\niterations per epoch, 2) Fewer trainable network parameters (no control\nparameters), and 3) Faster processing at inference. Our methods achieve\nperformance comparable to that of C-U-Net and the dedicated U-Nets at a much\nlower training cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Mar 2020 17:42:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2020 10:14:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 4 Sep 2020 13:37:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-07"}

Four distinct modes are involved, and the\nresonances occur within the frequency band of interferometric\ngravitational-wave detectors when the star spins at a frequency that lies\nwithin this band. The resonances are driven by the gravitomagnetic tidal field\ncreated by the companion star; this is described by a post-Newtonian vector\npotential, which is produced by the mass currents associated with the orbital\nmotion.

The objective is to\nmaximize the sum of influence propagation of a social network through\nmaximizing it within each community.

One of the methods used to estimate and\nvalidate redshift distributions is apply weights to a spectroscopic sample so\nthat their weighted photometry distribution matches the target sample. In this\nwork we estimate the \\textit{selection bias} in redshift that is introduced in\nthis procedure. We do so by simulating the process of assembling a\nspectroscopic sample (including observer-assigned confidence flags) and\nhighlight the impacts of spectroscopic target selection and redshift failures.\nWe use the first year (Y1) weak lensing analysis in DES as an example data set\nbut the implications generalise to all similar weak lensing surveys. We find\nthat using colour cuts that are not available to the weak lensing galaxies can\nintroduce biases of $\\Delta~z\\sim0.015$ in the weighted mean redshift of\ndifferent redshift intervals. To assess the impact of incompleteness in\nspectroscopic samples, we select only objects with high observer-defined\nconfidence flags and compare the weighted mean redshift with the true mean. We\nfind that the mean redshift of the DES Y1 weak lensing sample is typically\nbiased at the $\\Delta~z=0.005-0.05$ level after the weighting is applied. The\nbias we uncover can have either sign, depending on the samples and redshift\ninterval considered. For the highest redshift bin, the bias is larger than the\nuncertainties in the other DES Y1 redshift calibration methods, justifying the\ndecision of not using this method for the redshift estimations. We discuss\nseveral methods to mitigate this bias.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Mar 2020 18:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Aug 2020 12:43:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-04"}

We\nfind that stars born with masses between $\\sim60\\,\\rm{kM}_{\\odot}$ and\n$\\sim150\\,\\rm{kM}_{\\odot}$ collapse at the end of the main sequence, burning\nstably for $\\sim1.5\\,\\rm{Myr}$. More massive stars collapse directly through\nthe general relativistic instability after only a thermal timescale of\n$\\sim3\\,\\rm{kyr}$--$4\\,\\rm{kyr}$. The expected difficulty in producing such\nmassive, thermally-relaxed objects, together with recent results for currently\npreferred rapidly-accreting formation models, suggests that such ``truly\ndirect'' or ``dark'' collapses may not be typical for supermassive objects in\nthe early Universe. We close by discussing the evolution of supermassive stars\nin the broader context of massive primordial stellar evolution and the\npossibility of supermassive stellar explosions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Mar 2020 18:02:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-01"}

However, gathering a cleanly annotated dataset\nis not always feasible due to practical challenges. As a result, label noise is\na common problem in datasets, and numerous methods to train deep neural\nnetworks in the presence of noisy labels are proposed in the literature. These\nmethods commonly use benchmark datasets with synthetic label noise on the\ntraining set. However, there are multiple types of label noise, and each of\nthem has its own characteristic impact on learning. Since each work generates a\ndifferent kind of label noise, it is problematic to test and compare those\nalgorithms in the literature fairly. In this work, we provide a detailed\nanalysis of the effects of different kinds of label noise on learning.\nMoreover, we propose a generic framework to generate feature-dependent label\nnoise, which we show to be the most challenging case for learning. Our proposed\nmethod aims to emphasize similarities among data instances by sparsely\ndistributing them in the feature domain. By this approach, samples that are\nmore likely to be mislabeled are detected from their softmax probabilities, and\ntheir labels are flipped to the corresponding class.

To one's surprise, there\nexist approximate universal relations connecting certain bulk properties of NSs\nthat are insensitive to the underlying EoS and having important applications on\nprobing fundamental physics including nuclear and gravitational physics. To\ndate, analytic works on universal relations for realistic NSs are lacking,\nwhich may lead to a better understanding of the origin of the universality.\nHere, we focus on the universal relations between the compactness(C), moment of\ninertia (I), and tidal deformability(related to the Love number), and derive\nanalytic, approximate I-Love-C relations. To achieve this, we construct\nslowly-rotating/ tidally-deformed NS solutions analytically starting from an\nextended Tolman VII model that accurately describes non-rotating realistic NSs,\nallowing us to extract the moment of inertia and the tidal deformability on top\nof the compactness. We solve the field equations analytically by expanding them\nabout the Newtonian limit and keeping up to 6th order in the stellar\ncompactness. Based on these analytic solutions, we can mathematically\ndemonstrate the O(10%) EoS variation in the I-C and Love-C relations and the\nO(1%) variation in the I-Love relation that have previously been found\nnumerically. Our new analytic relations agree more accurately with numerical\nresults for realistic NSs(especially the I-C and Love-C ones) than the analytic\nrelations for constant density stars derived in previous work. Based on these\nanalytic findings, we attribute a possible origin of the universality for the\nI-C and Love-C relations to the fact that the energy density of realistic NSs\ncan be approximated as a quadratic function, as is the case for the Tolman VII\nsolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Mar 2020 19:13:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 23 May 2020 00:48:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 26 May 2020 03:55:40 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 24 Sep 2020 23:39:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-28"}

Observations of high temperature flare\nplasma hold many potential clues as to the nature of this energy release. It is\nclear, however, that flares are not composed of a few impulsively heated loops,\nbut are the result of heating on many small-scale threads that are energized\nover time, making it difficult to compare observations and numerical\nsimulations in detail. Several previous studies have shown that it is possible\nto reproduce some aspects of the observed emission by considering the flare as\na sequence of independently heated loops, but these studies generally focus on\nsmall-scale features while ignoring the global features of the flare. In this\npaper, we develop a multithreaded model that encompasses the time-varying\ngeometry and heating rate for a series of successively-heated loops comprising\nan arcade. To validate, we compare with spectral observations of five flares\nmade with the MinXSS CubeSat as well as light curves measured with GOES/XRS and\nSDO/AIA. We show that this model can successfully reproduce the light curves\nand quasi-periodic pulsations in GOES/XRS, the soft X-ray spectra seen with\nMinXSS, and the light curves in various AIA passbands. The AIA light curves are\nmost consistent with long duration heating, but elemental abundances cannot be\nconstrained with the model.

Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations with a\nTIP4P/2005 water model to study translational and rotational relaxation\ndynamics of interfacial water on graphene surfaces. The purpose of this study\nis to investigate the influence of both surface chemistry as well as the extent\nof hydration on the rotational transitions of interfacial water on graphene\noxide (GO) surfaces in the deeply supercooled region. We have considered three\ngraphene-based surfaces; a GO surface with equal proportions of oxidized and\npristine graphene regions in a striped topology, a fully oxidized surface and a\npristine graphene surface. The dipole relaxation time of interfacial water\nshows a strong-to-strong, strong, and a fragile-to-strong transition on these\nsurfaces, respectively, in the temperature range of 210-298 K. In contrast,\nbulk water shows a fragile-to-strong transition upon supercooling. In all these\ncases at high hydration, interfacial water co-exists with a thick water film\nwith bulk-like properties. To investigate the influence of bulk water on\ndynamical transitions, we simulated a low hydration regime where only bound\nwater (surface water) is present on the GO surfaces and found that the\nrotational relaxation of surface water on both the GO and fully oxidized\nsurfaces show a single Arrhenius behavior.

A conventional explanation\nof this phenomena is based on self-regularization properties of algorithms used\nto train the data. In this paper we prove a series of results which provide a\nsomewhat diverging explanation. Adopting a teacher/student model where the\nteacher network is used to generate the predictions and student network is\ntrained on the observed labeled data, and then tested on out-of-sample data, we\nshow that any student network interpolating the data generated by a teacher\nnetwork generalizes well, provided that the sample size is at least an explicit\nquantity controlled by data dimension and approximation guarantee alone,\nregardless of the number of internal nodes of either teacher or student\nnetwork.\n  Our claim is based on approximating both teacher and student networks by\npolynomial (tensor) regression models with degree depending on the desired\naccuracy and network depth only. Such a parametrization notably does not depend\non the number of internal nodes. Thus a message implied by our results is that\nparametrizing wide neural networks by the number of hidden nodes is misleading,\nand a more fitting measure of parametrization complexity is the number of\nregression coefficients associated with tensorized data. In particular, this\nsomewhat reconciles the generalization ability of neural networks with more\nclassical statistical notions of data complexity and generalization bounds. Our\nempirical results on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets indeed confirm that\ntensorized regression achieves a good out-of-sample performance, even when the\ndegree of the tensor is at most two.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Mar 2020 20:09:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-25"}

Four numerically\npredicted categories of complex dynamical behavior and pattern formation are\nidentified for bright and dark solitary waves propagating around an active\nmagnetic thin film-based feedback ring: (1) periodic breathing; (2) complex\nrecurrence; (3) spontaneous spatial shifting; and (4) intermittency. These\nnontransient, long lifetime behaviors are observed in microwave spin wave\nenvelopes circulating within a dispersive, nonlinear yttrium iron garnet\nwaveguide operating in a ring geometry where the net losses are directly\ncompensated for via linear amplification on each round trip O(100 ns). The\nbehaviors exhibit periods ranging from tens to thousands of round trip times\nO($\\mu$ s) and are stable for 1000s of periods O(ms). We present 10\nobservations of these dynamical behaviors which span the experimentally\naccessible ranges of attractive cubic nonlinearity, dispersion, and external\nfield strength that support the self-generation of backward volume spin waves\nin a four-wave-mixing dominant regime. Three-wave splitting is not explicitly\nforbidden and is treated as an additional source of nonlinear losses. Each of\nthese long lifetime behaviors of bright solitary waves was previously\nnumerically predicted to be observable. The dynamical pattern formation of dark\nsolitary waves in attractive nonlinearity, however, is entirely novel and is\nreported for both the periodic breather and complex recurrence behaviors. All\nbehaviors are identified in the group velocity co-moving frame.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Mar 2020 20:48:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Mar 2020 21:59:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-21"}

We aimed to introduce a deep learning method to detect such patterns\nautomatically. To do so, convolutional neural network was trained to detect\ncribriform growth patterns on 128 prostate needle biopsies. Ensemble learning\ntaking into account other tumor growth patterns during training was used to\ncope with heterogeneous and limited tumor tissue occurrences. ROC and FROC\nanalyses were applied to assess network performance regarding detection of\nbiopsies harboring cribriform growth pattern. The ROC analysis yielded a mean\narea under the curve up to 0.81. FROC analysis demonstrated a sensitivity of\n0.9 for regions larger than 0.0150 mm2 with on average 7.5 false positives. To\nbenchmark method performance for intra-observer annotation variability, false\npositive and negative detections were re-evaluated by the pathologists.\nPathologists considered 9% of the false positive regions as cribriform, and 11%\nas possibly cribriform; 44% of the false negative regions were not annotated as\ncribriform. As a final experiment, the network was also applied on a dataset of\n60 biopsy regions annotated by 23 pathologists.

It can detect cribriform regions that are labelled as such by\nat least a minority of pathologists.

To address the origin of this\nMVE depletion, we conducted a systematic study of high-precision K isotopic\ncomposition on 16 carbonaceous chondrites (CCs) of types CM1-2, CO3, CV3, CR2,\nCK4-5 and CH3 and 28 ordinary chondrites (OCs) covering petrological types 3 to\n6 and chemical groups H, L, and LL. We observed significant overall K isotope\n(delta41K) variations (-1.54 to 0.70 permil). The K isotope compositions of CCs\nare largely higher than the Bulk Silicate Earth (BSE) value, whereas OCs show\ntypically lower values than BSE. Neither CCs nor OCs show resolvable\ncorrelations between K isotopes and chemical groups, petrological types, shock\nlevels, exposure ages, fall or find occurrence, or terrestrial weathering. The\nlack of a clear trend between K isotopes and K content indicates that the K\nisotope fractionations were decoupled from the relative elemental K depletions.\nThe range of K isotope variations in the CCs is consistent with a\nfour-component (chondrule, refractory inclusion, matrix and water) mixing model\nthat is able to explain the bulk elemental and isotopic compositions of the\nmain CC groups, but requires a fractionation in K isotopic compositions in\nchondrules. We propose that the major control of the isotopic compositions of\ngroup averages is condensation or vaporization in nebular environments that is\npreserved in the compositional variation of chondrules. Parent-body processes\n(aqueous alteration, thermal metamorphism, and metasomatism) can mobilize K and\naffect the K isotopes in individual samples. In the case of the OCs, the full\nrange of K isotopic variations can only be explained by the combined effects of\nthe size and relative abundances of chondrules, parent-body aqueous and thermal\nalteration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Mar 2020 20:58:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-25"}

In this paper, we show that\nprior work on membership inference attacks may severely underestimate the\nprivacy risks by relying solely on training custom neural network classifiers\nto perform attacks and focusing only on the aggregate results over data\nsamples, such as the attack accuracy. To overcome these limitations, we first\npropose to benchmark membership inference privacy risks by improving existing\nnon-neural network based inference attacks and proposing a new inference attack\nmethod based on a modification of prediction entropy. We also propose\nbenchmarks for defense mechanisms by accounting for adaptive adversaries with\nknowledge of the defense and also accounting for the trade-off between model\naccuracy and privacy risks. Using our benchmark attacks, we demonstrate that\nexisting defense approaches are not as effective as previously reported.\n  Next, we introduce a new approach for fine-grained privacy analysis by\nformulating and deriving a new metric called the privacy risk score. Our\nprivacy risk score metric measures an individual sample's likelihood of being a\ntraining member, which allows an adversary to identify samples with high\nprivacy risks and perform attacks with high confidence. We experimentally\nvalidate the effectiveness of the privacy risk score and demonstrate that the\ndistribution of privacy risk score across individual samples is heterogeneous.\nFinally, we perform an in-depth investigation for understanding why certain\nsamples have high privacy risks, including correlations with model sensitivity,\ngeneralization error, and feature embeddings.

Recent work on the spread of interacting\ncontagions on networks has highlighted that these interacting contagions can\nhave counter-intuitive interplay with network structure. Here we generalize one\nof these frameworks to tackle three important features of the spread of\nawareness and disease: one, we model the dynamics on highly clustered,\ncliquish, networks to mimic the role of workplaces and households; two, the\nawareness contagion affects the spread of the biological contagion by reducing\nits transmission rate where an aware or vaccinated individual is less likely to\nbe infected; and three, the biological contagion also affects the spread of the\nawareness contagion but by increasing its transmission rate where an infected\nindividual is more receptive and more likely to share information related to\nthe disease. Under these conditions, we find that increasing network\nclustering, which is known to hinder disease spread, can actually allow them to\nsustain larger epidemics of the disease in models with awareness. This\ncounter-intuitive result goes against the conventional wisdom suggesting that\nrandom networks are justifiable as they provide worst-case scenario forecasts.\nTo further investigate this result, we provide a closed-form criterion based on\na two-step branching process (i.e., the numbers of expected tertiary\ninfections) to identify different regions in parameter space where the net\neffect of clustering and co-infection varies. Altogether, our results highlight\nonce again the need to go beyond random networks in disease modeling and\nillustrate the type of analysis that is possible even in complex models of\ninteracting contagions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 2020 01:30:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-02"}

Such a sizable computational cost hinders the broad\napplicability of smoothing splines. In practice, the full sample smoothing\nspline estimator can be approximated by an estimator based on $q$\nrandomly-selected basis functions, resulting in a computational cost of\n$O(nq^2)$. It is known that these two estimators converge at the identical rate\nwhen $q$ is of the order $O\\{n^{2/(pr+1)}\\}$, where $p\\in [1,2]$ depends on the\ntrue function $\\eta$, and $r > 1$ depends on the type of spline.

Vehicles platooning is an application of Smart City\nthat improves traffic capacity and safety by C-V2X. However, different from\nvehicles platooning travelling on highways, C-V2X could be more easily\neavesdropped and the spectrum resource could be limited when they converge at\nan intersection. Satisfying the secrecy rate of C-V2X, how to increase the\nspectrum efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE) in the platooning network\nis a big challenge. In this paper, to solve this problem, we propose a\nSecurity-Aware Approach to Enhancing SE and EE Based on Deep Reinforcement\nLearning, named SEED. The SEED formulates an objective optimization function\nconsidering both SE and EE, and the secrecy rate of C-V2X is treated as a\ncritical constraint of this function. The optimization problem is transformed\ninto the spectrum and transmission power selections of V2V and V2I links using\ndeep Q network (DQN). The heuristic result of SE and EE is obtained by the DQN\npolicy based on rewards. Finally, we simulate the traffic and communication\nenvironments using Python. The evaluation results demonstrate that the SEED\noutperforms the DQN-wopa algorithm and the baseline algorithm by 31.83 % and\n68.40 % in efficiency.

The buy-many property\nallows the buyer to interact with the mechanism multiple times instead of once\nas in the more commonly studied buy-one mechanisms. This imposes additional\nincentive constraints and thus restricts the space of mechanisms that the\nseller can use.\n  In this paper, we explore the qualitative differences between buy-one and\nbuy-many mechanisms focusing on two important properties: revenue continuity\nand menu-size complexity.\n  Our first main result is that when the value function of the buyer is\nperturbed multiplicatively by a factor of $1\\pm\\epsilon$, the optimal revenue\nobtained by buy-many mechanisms only changes by a factor of $1 \\pm\n\\textrm{poly}(n,\\epsilon)$. In contrast, for buy-one mechanisms, the revenue of\nthe resulting optimal mechanism after such a perturbation can change\narbitrarily.\n  Our second main result shows that under any distribution of arbitrary\nvaluations, finite menu size suffices to achieve a $(1-\\epsilon)$-approximation\nto the optimal buy-many mechanism. We give tight upper and lower bounds on the\nnumber of menu entries as a function of $n$ and $\\epsilon$. On the other hand,\nsuch a result fails to hold for buy-one mechanisms as even for two items and a\nbuyer with either unit-demand or additive valuations, the menu-size complexity\nof approximately optimal mechanisms is unbounded.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 2020 03:25:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-25"}

First, we observe that examples with uniform random labels\nhave higher losses when trained with stochastic gradient descent under large\nlearning rates. Then, we propose to model the loss distribution of the\ncounterfactual examples using only the network parameters, which is able to\nmodel such examples with remarkable success. Finally, we propose to remove\nexamples whose loss exceeds a certain quantile of the modeled loss\ndistribution. This leads to On-the-fly Data Denoising (ODD), a simple yet\neffective algorithm that is robust to mislabeled examples, while introducing\nalmost zero computational overhead compared to standard training. ODD is able\nto achieve state-of-the-art results on a wide range of datasets including\nreal-world ones such as WebVision and Clothing1M.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 2020 03:59:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Apr 2020 04:59:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-10"}

It is supposed that the base station\nemploys transmit beamforming with a given requirement on sum transmitting\npower. The objective is to maximize the sum secrecy rate of the network. Due to\nthe uncertainty of the channel, it is difficult to calculate the exact sum\nsecrecy rate of the system. Thus, the maximum of lower bound of sum secrecy\nrate is considered. The optimization of the lower bound of sum secrecy rate\nstill makes the considered beamforming design problem difficult to handle. To\nsolve this problem, a beamforming design scheme is proposed to transform the\noriginal problem into a convex approximation problem, by employing semidefinite\nrelaxation and first-order approximation technique based on Taylor expansion.\nBesides, with the advantage of low complexity, a zero-forcing based beamforming\nmethod is presented in the case that base station is able to nullify the\neavesdroppers' rate.

The temporal constraint network takes the reference images and the\ntarget image together in chronological order, and learns the spatiotemporal\nfeatures through 3D convolution to ensure the temporal consistency of the\ntarget image and the reference image. Our model can achieve even better\ncoloring results by fine-tuning the parameters with only a small amount of\nsamples when dealing with an animation of a new style. To evaluate our method,\nwe build a line art coloring dataset. Experiments show that our method achieves\nthe best performance on line art video coloring compared to the\nstate-of-the-art methods and other baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 2020 06:57:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Mar 2020 07:34:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-31"}

The actual number\nof infected cases in France is probably much higher than the observations: we\nfind here a factor x 15 (95%-CI: 4-33), which leads to a 5.2/1000 mortality\nrate (95%-CI: 1.5 / 1000-11.7/ 1000) at the end of the observation period. We\nfind a R0 of 4.8, a high value which may be linked to the long viral shedding\nperiod of 20 days.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 2020 08:58:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Mar 2020 09:52:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 17 Apr 2020 13:34:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-15"}

In order to more precisely elucidate the physical\nmechanisms behind the two phenomena, in this paper we develop a generalized\npendulum-like model based on the two common features of non-linear\nauto-oscillators: one is the stability of the amplitude/energy of dynamic\nstates; the other is the non-linear dynamic state energy of oscillators. In\nthis new model, we find that the Newtonian-like particle with sufficient\nkinetic energy can overcome the barrier of phase-locking potential to evolve\ninto a stable asynchronization (AS) state, leading to the (IC)-dependent\nsynchronization. Furthermore, due to the presence of the kinetic energy, this\nparticle can also oscillate around the minima of the phase-locking potential,\nleading to the oscillatory decaying regime. Thereby, in this work, we adopt\nthis new model to analyze the IC-dependent mutual synchronization of\nperpendicularto-plane (PERP)-STNO pairs, and then we suggest that the initial\nconditions can be controlled to avoid such a phenomenon by using magnetic\ndipolar coupling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 2020 09:23:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 May 2021 13:59:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-07"}

We first explain our\nstrategy in detail to investigate baryon-baryon interactions by defining\npotentials in field theories such as QCD. We introduce the Nambu-Bethe-Salpeter\n(NBS) wave functions in QCD for two baryons below the inelastic threshold. We\nthen define the potential from NBS wave functions in terms of the derivative\nexpansion, which is shown to reproduce the scattering phase shifts correctly\nbelow the inelastic threshold. Using this definition, we formulate a method to\nextract the potential in lattice QCD. Secondly, we discuss pros and cons of the\nHAL QCD method, by comparing it with the conventional method, where one\ndirectly extracts the scattering phase shifts from the finite volume energies\nthrough the L\\\"uscher's formula. We give several theoretical and numerical\nevidences that the conventional method combined with the naive plateau fitting\nfor the finite volume energies in the literature so far fails to work on\nbaryon-baryon interactions due to contaminations of elastic excited states. On\nthe other hand, we show that such a serious problem can be avoided in the HAL\nQCD method by defining the potential in an energy-independent way.

When the changes in the\nreservoir are very small, the changes in the seismic response can become too\nsmall to be reliably detected. In theory, multiple reflections can be used to\nimprove the detectability of traveltime changes: a wave that propagates several\ntimes down and up through a reservoir layer will undergo a larger time shift\ndue to reservoir changes than a primary reflection.

Seminal\nDeeply-Supervised Networks (DSN) were proposed to alleviate the difficulty of\noptimization arising from gradient flow through a long chain. However, it is\nstill vulnerable to issues including interference to the hierarchical\nrepresentation generation process and inconsistent optimization objectives, as\nillustrated theoretically and empirically in this paper. Complementary to\nprevious training strategies, we propose Dynamic Hierarchical Mimicking, a\ngeneric feature learning mechanism, to advance CNN training with enhanced\ngeneralization ability. Partially inspired by DSN, we fork delicately designed\nside branches from the intermediate layers of a given neural network. Each\nbranch can emerge from certain locations of the main branch dynamically, which\nnot only retains representation rooted in the backbone network but also\ngenerates more diverse representations along its own pathway. We go one step\nfurther to promote multi-level interactions among different branches through an\noptimization formula with probabilistic prediction matching losses, thus\nguaranteeing a more robust optimization process and better representation\nability.

The authors\nexamined the foundations of this theory in their \"Box 1: A brief primer on\nlocal detailed balance and stochastic thermodynamics\", where a kinetic scheme\nfor transport of particles between two reservoirs is presented. Horowitz and\nGingrich arrive at a relationship between the probability to cycle through the\nstates in one order vs. the probability to cycle in the reverse order. This\nrelation bears on the extremely important question of what governs\ndirectionality when a system is driven away from equilibrium by contact with\nmultiple reservoirs that are not in equilibrium with one another. In the\noriginal version of their paper the relation given for this ratio was obviously\nwrong and contrary to the second law of thermodynamics. Based on our private\ncommunications and on the recent paper authored by my colleagues and myself,\nHorowitz and Gingrich accepted the necessity of correcting the error in their\nBox 1. Unfortunately, in making the correction, the authors introduced an\nequally serious, if less transparent, mistake, and continue to base their\ntheory on the thermodynamically impossible idea that transitions are mediated\nby only one of the two reservoirs. In this comment we illustrate how the\nprinciple of microscopic reversibility reveals that the true origin of\ndirectional cycling amongst a network of states is kinetic asymmetry.

The disparity estimation problem tends to be addressed by DNNs\nwhich achieve much better prediction accuracy in stereo matching than\ntraditional hand-crafted feature based methods. On one hand, however, the\ndesigned DNNs require significant memory and computation resources to\naccurately predict the disparity, especially for those 3D convolution based\nnetworks, which makes it difficult for deployment in real-time applications. On\nthe other hand, existing computation-efficient networks lack expression\ncapability in large-scale datasets so that they cannot make an accurate\nprediction in many scenarios. To this end, we propose an efficient and accurate\ndeep network for disparity estimation named FADNet with three main features: 1)\nIt exploits efficient 2D based correlation layers with stacked blocks to\npreserve fast computation; 2) It combines the residual structures to make the\ndeeper model easier to learn; 3) It contains multi-scale predictions so as to\nexploit a multi-scale weight scheduling training technique to improve the\naccuracy. We conduct experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of FADNet on\ntwo popular datasets, Scene Flow and KITTI 2015. Experimental results show that\nFADNet achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy, and runs at a significant\norder of magnitude faster speed than existing 3D models.

The CNN classifies given input images into two\ncategories: positive and negative. The positive category is where the surface\ndamage is present within the image, otherwise the image is classified as\nnegative. This is an image-based classification. The ANN accepts image inputs\nthat have been classified as positive by the ANN. This reduces the number of\nimages that are further processed by the ANN. The ANN performs feature-based\nclassification, in which the features are extracted from the detected edges\nwithin the image. The edges are detected using Canny edge detection. A total of\n19 features are extracted from the detected edges. These features are inputs\ninto the ANN. The purpose of the ANN is to highlight only the positive damaged\nedges within the image. The CNN achieves an accuracy of 80.7% for image\nclassification and the ANN achieves an accuracy of 98.1% for surface detection.\nThe decreased accuracy in the CNN is due to the false positive detection,\nhowever false positives are tolerated whereas false negatives are not.

Photometric redshifts can be\nefficiently combined with the cosmic web (CW) extracted from overlapping\nspectroscopic surveys to improve their accuracy. We apply a similar method\nusing a new generation of photometric redshifts based on a convolution neural\nnetwork (CNN). The CNN is trained on the SDSS images with the main galaxy\nsample (SDSS-MGS, $r \\leq 17.8$) and the GAMA spectroscopic redshifts up tor\n$\\sim 19.8$. The mapping of the CW is obtained with 680,000 spectroscopic\nredshifts from the MGS and BOSS surveys. The redshift probability distribution\nfunctions (PDF), which are well calibrated (unbiased and narrow, $\\leq 120$\nMpc), intercept a few CW structure along the line of sight. Combining these\nPDFs with the density field distribution provides new photometric redshifts,\n$z_{web}$, whose accuracy is improved by a factor of two (i.e.,${\\sigma} \\sim\n0.004(1+z)$) for galaxies with $r \\leq 17.8$. For half of them, the distance\naccuracy is better than 10 cMpc. The narrower the original PDF, the larger the\nboost in accuracy. No gain is observed for original PDFs wider than 0.03.

The method performs slightly\nbetter for passive galaxies than star-forming ones, and for galaxies in massive\ngroups since these populations better trace the underlying large-scale\nstructure. Reducing the spectroscopic sampling by a factor of 8 still improves\nthe photometric redshift accuracy by 25%.

In this paper, we\npresent two extensions of equitable partitions into branchings in digraphs:\nthose into matching forests in mixed graphs; and into $b$-branchings in\ndigraphs. For matching forests, Kir\\'{a}ly and Yokoi (2022) considered a\ntricriteria equitability based on the sizes of the matching forest, and the\nmatching and branching therein.

As typically observed\ninterstellar dust distributions follow a power-law, our method adopts a\npower-law discretisation and uses both the grain mass and number densities in\neach bin to determine the power-law parameters. This power-law method is\ncomplementary to piecewise-constant and linear methods in the literature. We\nfind that the power-law method surpasses the other two approaches, especially\nfor small bin numbers. In the sputtering tests the relative error in the total\ngrain mass remains below 0.01% independent of the number of bins N, while the\nother methods only achieve this for N > 50 or higher. Likewise, the shattering\ntest shows that the method also produces small relative errors in the total\ngrain numbers while conserving mass. Not only does the power-law method\nconserve the global distribution properties, it also preserves the inter-bin\ncharacteristics so that the shape of the distribution is recovered to a high\ndegree. This does not always happen for the constant and linear methods,\nespecially not for small bin numbers. Implementing the power-law method in a\nhydrodynamical code thus minimises the numerical cost whilst maintaining high\naccuracy.

The proposed method, Interaction Pursuit Biconvex Optimization\n(IPBO), explores the regression relationship allowing the predictors and\nresponses derived from different multivariate normal distributions with general\ncovariance matrices.

The analysis of cache-enabled wireless networks is\nusually carried out by assuming that devices are uniformly distributed,\nhowever, in social networks, mobile devices are intrinsically grouped into\ndisjoint clusters. In this regards, this paper proposes a spatiotemporal\nmathematical model that tracks the service requests arrivals and account for\nthe clustered devices geometry. Two kinds of devices are assumed, particularly,\ncontent clients and content providers. Content providers are assumed to have a\nsurplus memory which is exploited to proactively cache contents from a known\nlibrary, following a random probabilistic caching scheme. Content clients can\nretrieve a requested content from the nearest content provider in their\nproximity (cluster), or, as a last resort, the base station (BS). The developed\nspatiotemporal model is leveraged to formulate a joint optimization problem of\nthe content caching and spectrum partitioning in order to minimize the average\nservice delay. Due to the high complexity of the optimization problem, the\ncaching and spectrum partitioning problems are decoupled and solved iteratively\nusing the block coordinate descent (BCD) optimization technique. To this end,\nan optimal and suboptimal solutions are obtained for the bandwidth partitioning\nand probabilistic caching subproblems, respectively. Numerical results\nhighlight the superiority of the proposed scheme over conventional caching\nschemes under equal and optimized bandwidth allocations.

All jammed states, either compression or shear\njammed, are isostatic, and exhibit jamming criticality of the same universality\nclass. However, the anisotropy of contact networks non-trivially depends on the\njamming density and strain. Among all state points on the jamming-plane, the\njamming-point is a unique one with the minimum jamming density and the maximum\nrandomness.

While its existence was\nfirst hypothesized half a century ago, the EI has eluded experimental\nobservation in bulk materials for decades. In the last few years, a resurgence\nof interest in the subject has been driven by the identification of several\ncandidate materials suspected to support an excitonic condensate. However, one\nobstacle in verifying the nature of these systems has been to find signatures\nof the EI that distinguish it from a normal insulator. To address this, we\nfocus on a clear qualitative difference between the two phases: the existence\nof Goldstone modes born by the spontaneous breaking of a $U(1)$ symmetry in the\nEI. Even if this mode is gapped, as occurs in the case of an approximate\nsymmetry, this branch of collective modes remains a fundamental feature of the\nlow-energy dynamics of the EI provided the symmetry-breaking is small. We study\na simple model that realizes an excitonic condensate, and use mean field theory\nwithin the random-phase approximation to determine its collective modes. We\nsubsequently develop a diagrammatic method to incorporate the effects of\ndisorder perturbatively, and use it to determine the scattering rate of the\ncollective modes. We interpret our results within an an effective field theory.\nThe collective modes are found to be robust against symmetry-preserving\ndisorder, implying an experimental fingerprint unique to the EI: the ballistic\npropagation of low-lying modes over mesoscopic distances, at electronic-scale\nvelocities. We suggest this could affect thermal transport at low temperatures,\nand could be observed via spatially-resolved pump-probe spectroscopy through\nthe coherent response of phonons that hybridize with the collective modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 2020 13:38:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Mar 2020 10:55:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 17 Jun 2020 11:19:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-18"}

Independently of the solar wind type, the solar wind\nmeasured in situ is always affected by both. We consider the proton-proton\ncollisional age as an ordering parameter for the solar wind at 1AU and explore\nits relation to the solar wind classification scheme developed by Xu & Borovsky\n(2015). We use this to show that explicit magnetic field information is not\nrequired for this solar wind classification. Based on the observation that the\nthree basic solar wind types from this categorization cover different regimes\nin terms of proton-proton collisional age $a_{col,p-p}$ , we propose a\nsimplified solar wind classification scheme that is only based on the\nproton-proton collisional age. The resulting so-called PAC solar wind\nclassifier is an alternative to the full Xu & Borovsky (2015) solar wind\nclassification scheme and leads to a classification that is very similar to the\nfull Xu & Borovsky (2015) scheme. The solar wind is well ordered by the\nproton-proton collisional age. This implies underlying intrinsic relationships\nbetween the plasma properties, in particular, proton temperature and magnetic\nfield strength in each plasma regime. We argue that sector-reversal plasma is a\ncombination of particularly slow and dense solar wind and most stream\ninteraction boundaries. Most solar wind parameters (e.g., the magnetic field\nstrength, B, and the oxygen charge state ratio $n_{O^{7+}}$ /$n_{O^{6+}}$)\nchange with the solar activity cycle. Thus, all solar wind categorization\nschemes based on threshold values need to be adapted to the solar activity\ncycle as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 2020 13:51:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-29"}

A significant challenge\nin developing such functions is to build flexible software that can be adapted\nto different operating environments, vendors, and operator use-cases. Today,\nrefactoring NF software for specific scenarios can take months. Furthermore,\nnetwork operators are increasingly adopting fast-paced development practices\nfor continuous software delivery to gain market advantage, which imposes even\nshorter development cycles. A key aspect in NF design is state management,\nwhich can be optimized across deployments by carefully selecting the underlying\ndata store. However, migrating to a data store that suits a different use-case\nis time consuming because it requires code refactoring while revisiting its\napplication programming interfaces, APIs.\n  In this paper we introduce FlexState, a state management system that\ndecouples the NF packet processing logic from the data store that maintains its\nstate. The objective is to reduce code refactoring significantly by\nincorporating an abstraction layer that exposes various data stores as\nconfiguration alternatives. Experiments show that FlexState achieves\nsignificant flexibility in optimizing the NF state management across several\nscenarios with negligible overhead.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 2020 14:23:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-25"}

This way, we keep the\nsimplicity and cost efficiency of identity authentication from a single image,\nwhile enjoying the benefits of geometric data without explicitly reconstructing\nit. We demonstrate that the suggested method outperforms both existing\nsingle-image and explicit depth based methods on large-scale benchmarks, and\neven capable of recognize spoofing attacks. We also provide an ablation study\nthat shows that the suggested method uses the face locations in the left and\nright images to encode informative features that improve the overall\nperformance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 2020 14:51:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Nov 2020 11:52:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-11"}

A metric measuring status freshness is\nthe age-of-information (AoI), which captures the time elapsed from the status\nbeing generated at the source node (e.g., a sensor) to the latest status\nupdate.However, in intelligent IoT applications such as video surveillance, the\nstatus information is revealed after some computation intensive and\ntime-consuming data processing operations, which would affect the status\nfreshness. In this paper, we propose a novel metric, age-of-processing (AoP),\nto quantify such status freshness, which captures the time elapsed of the\nnewest received processed status data since it is generated. Compared with AoI,\nAoP further takes the data processing time into account. Since an IoT device\nhas limited computation and energy resource, the device can choose to offload\nthe data processing to the nearby edge server under constrained status sampling\nfrequency.We aim to minimize the average AoP in a long-term process by jointly\noptimizing the status sampling frequency and processing offloading policy. We\nformulate this online problem as an infinite-horizon constrained Markov\ndecision process (CMDP) with average reward criterion.

Various one- and two-electron\ncapture processes occurring in course of the collisions of the two-electron\nsystem Th$^{90+}$-Ru$^{42+}(1s^2)$ have been investigated in details in the\nwide range of collision energies $0.5$-$50$~MeV/u. The impact parameter\ndependencies of the double electron-capture processes are also presented. Our\nstudy demonstrates a very significant role of the relativistic effects for the\nprocesses, which becomes crucial in the low-energy regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 2020 15:56:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-25"}

These problems pose huge computational challenges as evaluating\nthe objective function or misfit requires the solution of a large number of\nparameterized partial differential equations, typically one per source term.\nNewton-type algorithms, which may be required for fast convergence, typically\nrequire the additional solution of a large number of adjoint problems.\n  The use of parametric model reduction may substantially alleviate this\nproblem. In [de Sturler, E., Gugercin, S., Kilmer, M. E., Chaturantabut, S.,\nBeattie, C., and O'Connell, M. (2015). Nonlinear Parametric Inversion Using\nInterpolatory Model Reduction. SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing, 37(3)],\ninterpolatory model reduction was successfully used to drastically speed up\ninversion for Diffuse Optical Tomography (DOT). However, when using model\nreduction in high dimensional parameter spaces, obtaining error bounds in\nparameter space is typically intractable. In this paper, we propose to use\nstochastic estimates to remedy this problem. At the cost of one (randomized)\nfull-scale linear solve per optimization step we obtain a robust algorithm.\nMoreover, since we can now update the model when needed, this robustness allows\nus to further reduce the order of the reduced order model and hence the cost of\ncomputing and using it, further decreasing the cost of inversion. We also\npropose a method to update the model reduction basis that reduces the number of\nlarge linear solves required by 46%-98% compared with the fixed reduced-order\nmodel. We demonstrate that this leads to a highly efficient and robust\ninversion method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 2020 15:56:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-25"}

The method utilizes a\nsolution clustering approach in order to identify regions of the parameter\nspace over which solutions are sufficiently similarly such that they can be\ninterpolated on the Grassmannian. In this clustering, the reduced-order\nsolutions are partitioned into disjoint clusters on the Grassmann manifold\nusing the eigen-structure of properly defined Grassmannian kernels and, the\nKarcher mean of each cluster is estimated. Then, the points in each cluster are\nprojected onto the tangent space with origin at the corresponding Karcher mean\nusing the exponential mapping. For each cluster, a Gaussian process regression\nmodel is trained that maps the input parameters of the system to the reduced\nsolution points of the corresponding cluster projected onto the tangent space.\nUsing this Gaussian process model, the full-field solution can be efficiently\npredicted at any new point in the parameter space. In certain cases, the\nsolution clusters will span disjoint regions of the parameter space. In such\ncases, for each of the solution clusters we utilize a second, density-based\nspatial clustering to group their corresponding input parameter points in the\nEuclidean space.

The data consist of a\nsingle trace recorded at a given distance from a point source. The velocity or\nslowness is presumed homogeneous, and the target source wavelet is presumed\nquasi-impulsive or focused at zero time lag. The source is extended by\npermitting energy to spread in time, and the spread is controlled by adding a\nweighted mean square of the extended source wavelet to the data misfit, to\nproduce the extended inversion objective. The objective function and its\ngradient can be computed explicitly, and it is easily seen that all local\nminimizers must be within a wavelength of the correct slowness. The derivation\nshows several important features of all similar extended source algorithms. For\nexample, nested optimization, with the source estimation in the inner\noptimization (variable projection method), is essential. The choice of the\nweight operator, controlling the extended source degrees of freedom, is\ncritical: the choice presented here is a differential operator, and that\nproperty is crucial for production of an objective immune from cycle-skipping.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 2020 00:39:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Apr 2020 16:22:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-03"}
