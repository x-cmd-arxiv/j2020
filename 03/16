One prime bias in judgment and\ndecision-making is the human tendency to underestimate large quantities.\nPrevious research on social influence in estimation tasks has generally focused\non the impact of single estimates on individual and collective accuracy,\nshowing that randomly sharing estimates does not reduce the underestimation\nbias. Here, we test a method of social information sharing that exploits the\nknown relationship between the true value and the level of underestimation, and\nstudy if it can counteract the underestimation bias. We performed estimation\nexperiments in which participants had to estimate a series of quantities twice,\nbefore and after receiving estimates from one or several group members. Our\npurpose was threefold: to study (i) whether restructuring the sharing of social\ninformation can reduce the underestimation bias, (ii) how the number of\nestimates received affects the sensitivity to social influence and estimation\naccuracy, and (iii) the mechanisms underlying the integration of multiple\nestimates. Our restructuring of social interactions successfully countered the\nunderestimation bias. Moreover, we find that sharing more than one estimate\nalso reduces the underestimation bias. Underlying our results are a human\ntendency to herd, to trust larger estimates than one's own more than smaller\nestimates, and to follow disparate social information less. Using a\ncomputational modelling approach, we demonstrate that these effects are indeed\nkey to explain the experimental results. Overall, our results show that\nexisting knowledge on biases can be used to dampen their negative effects and\nboost judgment accuracy, paving the way for combating other cognitive biases\nthreatening collective systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Mar 2020 16:21:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 2022 10:58:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-12"}

The staggered\nDG scheme defines the discrete pressure on the primal triangular mesh, while\nthe discrete velocity is defined on a staggered edge-based dual quadrilateral\nmesh. In this paper, a new pair of equal-order-interpolation velocity-pressure\nfinite elements is proposed. On the primary triangular mesh (the pressure\nelements) the basis functions are piecewise polynomials of degree $N$ and are\nallowed to jump on the boundaries of each triangle. On the dual mesh instead\n(the velocity elements), the basis functions consist in the union of piecewise\npolynomials of degree $N$ on the two subtriangles that compose each\nquadrilateral and are allowed to jump only on the dual element boundaries,\nwhile they are continuous inside. In other words, the basis functions on the\ndual mesh are built by continuous finite elements on the subtriangles. This\nchoice allows the construction of an efficient, quadrature-free and memory\nsaving algorithm. In our coupled space-time pressure correction formulation for\nthe incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, arbitrary high order of accuracy in\ntime is achieved through the use of time-dependent test and basis functions, in\ncombination with simple and efficient Picard iterations.

The considerable composition\nspace afforded to these alloys makes optimizing for desired properties a\ndaunting task; theoretical and computational tools are necessary to guide alloy\ndevelopment.

Here the full three\ndimensional wave physics is simulated with finite differences to generate\nultrasound images of the human body based directly on the first principles of\npropagation and backscattering. The Visible Human project, a 3D data set of the\nhuman body that was generated with photographs of 0.33 mm cryosections, is\nconverted into 3D acoustical maps. A full-wave nonlinear acoustic simulation\ntool is used to propagate ultrasound into the liver with a 2D intercostal\nultrasound array in a $93 \\times 39 \\times 22$ mm domain with $6\\times10^8$\npoints. Imaging metrics, based on the beamplots, root-mean-square phase\naberration, spatial coherence lengths, and contrast-to-noise ratio are used to\ncharacterize the image quality. It is shown that the harmonic image quality is\nbetter than the fundamental image quality due, in part, to a narrower beam\nprofile. The root-mean-square estimate of aberration after propagation through\nthe simulated body wall is shown to be low (23.4 ns), consistently with\nprevious reports of aberration measured experimentally in a human body wall.\nThe spatial coherence measured at the transducer surface indicates that a\ntransducer array element size of $<0.81 \\lambda$ would be required to fully\nsample the acoustic field.

Assuming repeated spiking or bursting, a\nphase reset amounts to a brief perturbation that causes a shift in the phase of\nthis periodic motion. The observed effects not only depend on the strength of\nthe perturbation, but also on the phase at which it is applied. The\nrelationship between the change in phase after the perturbation and the\nunperturbed old phase, the so-called phase resetting curve, provides\ninformation about the type of neuronal behaviour, although not all effects of\nthe nature of the perturbation are well understood. In this chapter, we present\na numerical method based on the continuation of a multi-segment boundary value\nproblem that computes phase resetting curves in ODE models.

A key role has also been played by the latest advances in new\ndisciplines like network science. Nonetheless, current models still lack a\nfaithful representation of all possible heterogeneities and features that can\nbe extracted from data. Here, we bridge a current gap in the mathematical\nmodeling of infectious diseases and develop a framework that allows to account\nsimultaneously for both the connectivity of individuals and the age-structure\nof the population. We compare different scenarios, namely, i) the homogeneous\nmixing setting, ii) one in which only the social mixing is taken into account,\niii) a setting that considers the connectivity of individuals alone, and\nfinally, iv) a multilayer representation in which both the social mixing and\nthe number of contacts are included in the model. We analytically show that the\nthresholds obtained for these four scenarios are different. In addition, we\nconduct extensive numerical simulations and conclude that heterogeneities in\nthe contact network are important for a proper determination of the epidemic\nthreshold, whereas the age-structure plays a bigger role beyond the onset of\nthe outbreak. Altogether, when it comes to evaluate interventions such as\nvaccination, both sources of individual heterogeneity are important and should\nbe concurrently considered. Our results also provide an indication of the\nerrors incurred in situations in which one cannot access all needed information\nin terms of connectivity and age of the population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Mar 2020 23:24:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-09"}

Existing tactile sensors are either flat, have\nsmall sensitive fields or only provide low-resolution signals. In this paper,\nwe introduce OmniTact, a multi-directional high-resolution tactile sensor.\nOmniTact is designed to be used as a fingertip for robotic manipulation with\nrobotic hands, and uses multiple micro-cameras to detect multi-directional\ndeformations of a gel-based skin. This provides a rich signal from which a\nvariety of different contact state variables can be inferred using modern image\nprocessing and computer vision methods. We evaluate the capabilities of\nOmniTact on a challenging robotic control task that requires inserting an\nelectrical connector into an outlet, as well as a state estimation problem that\nis representative of those typically encountered in dexterous robotic\nmanipulation, where the goal is to infer the angle of contact of a curved\nfinger pressing against an object. Both tasks are performed using only touch\nsensing and deep convolutional neural networks to process images from the\nsensor's cameras. We compare with a state-of-the-art tactile sensor that is\nonly sensitive on one side, as well as a state-of-the-art multi-directional\ntactile sensor, and find that OmniTact's combination of high-resolution and\nmulti-directional sensing is crucial for reliably inserting the electrical\nconnector and allows for higher accuracy in the state estimation task.

With the intuition that the performance of\nsuch algorithms degrades with increasing randomness of the supply and demand,\ntwo properties are proposed for assessing the performance of the algorithms.\nFirst property is convergence to optimality (CO) as the underlying randomness\nof renewable generation and customer loads goes to zero. The second property is\ndeviation from optimality, is measured as a function of the standard deviation\nof the underlying randomness of renewable generation and customer loads.

One of the most effective adversarial defense methods is\nadversarial training (AT) through minimizing the adversarial risk $R_{adv}$,\nwhich encourages both the benign example $x$ and its adversarially perturbed\nneighborhoods within the $\\ell_{p}$-ball to be predicted as the ground-truth\nlabel. In this work, we propose a novel defense method, the robust training\n(RT), by jointly minimizing two separated risks ($R_{stand}$ and $R_{rob}$),\nwhich is with respect to the benign example and its neighborhoods respectively.\nThe motivation is to explicitly and jointly enhance the accuracy and the\nadversarial robustness. We prove that $R_{adv}$ is upper-bounded by $R_{stand}\n+ R_{rob}$, which implies that RT has similar effect as AT. Intuitively,\nminimizing the standard risk enforces the benign example to be correctly\npredicted, and the robust risk minimization encourages the predictions of the\nneighbor examples to be consistent with the prediction of the benign example.\nBesides, since $R_{rob}$ is independent of the ground-truth label, RT is\nnaturally extended to the semi-supervised mode ($i.e.$, SRT), to further\nenhance the adversarial robustness. Moreover, we extend the $\\ell_{p}$-bounded\nneighborhood to a general case, which covers different types of perturbations,\nsuch as the pixel-wise ($i.e.$, $x + \\delta$) or the spatial perturbation\n($i.e.$, $ AX + b$). Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets not only\nverify the superiority of the proposed SRT method to state-of-the-art methods\nfor defensing pixel-wise or spatial perturbations separately, but also\ndemonstrate its robustness to both perturbations simultaneously.

The spectral Rabi-splitting of photon emission or\nabsorption has been adopted to experimentally characterize the strong coupling\nunder the equality assumption that it is identical to the level splitting.\nHere, we for the first time reveal that the equality assumption is not valid.\nIt is the invalidity that results in the relativity and diversity of the strong\ncoupling characterized by the spectral Rabi-splitting to the measured\nsubsystems, highly correlated with their dissipative decays. The strong\ncoupling is easier to be observed from the subsystem with larger decay, and can\nbe classified into pseudo-, dark-, middle-, and super-strong interaction\nregimes. We also suggest a prototype of coupled plasmon-exciton system for\npossibly future experiment observations on these novel predictions.

The key idea is to decompose text detection into two subproblems,\nnamely detection of text primitives and prediction of link relationships\nbetween nearby text primitive pairs. Specifically, an anchor-free region\nproposal network based text detector is first used to detect text primitives of\ndifferent scales from different feature maps of a feature pyramid network, from\nwhich a text primitive graph is constructed by linking each pair of nearby text\nprimitives detected from a same feature map with an edge.

Any-shot detection\noffers unique challenges compared to conventional novel object detection such\nas, a high imbalance between unseen, few-shot and seen object classes,\nsusceptibility to forget base-training while learning novel classes and\ndistinguishing novel classes from the background. To address these challenges,\nwe propose a unified any-shot detection model, that can concurrently learn to\ndetect both zero-shot and few-shot object classes.

We model this as an (infinitely) repeated game, where the\nsystem holds a state (number of packets held by each queue) that arises from\nthe results of the previous round. We assume that routers satisfy the no-regret\ncondition, e.g. they use learning strategies to identify the server where their\npackets get the best service.\n  Classical work on repeated games makes the strong assumption that the\nsubsequent rounds of the repeated games are independent (beyond the influence\non learning from past history).

However, there are\ntwo underlying limitations to existing SR methods. First, learning the mapping\nfunction from LR to HR images is typically an ill-posed problem, because there\nexist infinite HR images that can be downsampled to the same LR image. As a\nresult, the space of the possible functions can be extremely large, which makes\nit hard to find a good solution. Second, the paired LR-HR data may be\nunavailable in real-world applications and the underlying degradation method is\noften unknown. For such a more general case, existing SR models often incur the\nadaptation problem and yield poor performance. To address the above issues, we\npropose a dual regression scheme by introducing an additional constraint on LR\ndata to reduce the space of the possible functions. Specifically, besides the\nmapping from LR to HR images, we learn an additional dual regression mapping\nestimates the down-sampling kernel and reconstruct LR images, which forms a\nclosed-loop to provide additional supervision. More critically, since the dual\nregression process does not depend on HR images, we can directly learn from LR\nimages. In this sense, we can easily adapt SR models to real-world data, e.g.,\nraw video frames from YouTube. Extensive experiments with paired training data\nand unpaired real-world data demonstrate our superiority over existing methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Mar 2020 04:23:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 26 Apr 2020 10:19:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 29 Apr 2020 09:58:07 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 22 May 2020 15:57:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-25"}

In this work, we present the Conditional Domain\nNormalization (CDN) to bridge the domain gap. CDN is designed to encode\ndifferent domain inputs into a shared latent space, where the features from\ndifferent domains carry the same domain attribute. To achieve this, we first\ndisentangle the domain-specific attribute out of the semantic features from one\ndomain via a domain embedding module, which learns a domain-vector to\ncharacterize the corresponding domain attribute information. Then this\ndomain-vector is used to encode the features from another domain through a\nconditional normalization, resulting in different domains' features carrying\nthe same domain attribute. We incorporate CDN into various convolution stages\nof an object detector to adaptively address the domain shifts of different\nlevel's representation. In contrast to existing adaptation works that conduct\ndomain confusion learning on semantic features to remove domain-specific\nfactors, CDN aligns different domain distributions by modulating the semantic\nfeatures of one domain conditioned on the learned domain-vector of another\ndomain. Extensive experiments show that CDN outperforms existing methods\nremarkably on both real-to-real and synthetic-to-real adaptation benchmarks,\nincluding 2D image detection and 3D point cloud detection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Mar 2020 08:27:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Jul 2020 04:18:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-23"}

Subsequently,\nsegmentation label of the atlas can be transferred to the unlabelled data with\nthe learned correspondence. However, since ground truth correspondence between\nimages is usually unavailable, the learning system must be well-supervised to\navoid mode collapse and convergence failure.

This cycle-correspondence\nlearning design enables a variety of extra, cycle-consistency-based supervision\nsignals to make the training process stable, while also boost the performance.\nWe demonstrate the superiority of our method over both deep learning-based\none-shot segmentation methods and a classical multi-atlas segmentation method\nvia thorough experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Mar 2020 08:36:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Mar 2020 10:47:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 20 Mar 2020 04:50:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-23"}

These are methods\nthat use a linear minimization oracle, which, for a given vector $p \\in\n\\mathbb{R}^n$, computes the solution of the subproblem $$\\arg \\min_{x\\in\nX}{\\langle p,x \\rangle}.$$ There are a variety of conditional gradient methods\nthat have a linear convergence rate in a strongly convex case. However, in all\nthese methods, the dimension of the problem is included in the rate of\nconvergence, which in modern applications can be very large. In this paper, we\nprove that in the strongly convex case, the convergence rate of the conditional\ngradient methods in the best case depends on the dimension of the problem $ n $\nas $ \\widetilde {\\Omega} (\\sqrt {n}) $. Thus, the conditional gradient methods\nmay turn out to be ineffective for solving strongly convex optimization\nproblems of large dimensions. Also, the application of conditional gradient\nmethods to minimization problems of a quadratic form is considered.\n  The effectiveness of the Frank-Wolfe method for solving the quadratic\noptimization problem in the convex case on a simplex (PageRank) has already\nbeen proved. This work shows that the use of conditional gradient methods to\nsolve the minimization problem of a quadratic form in a strongly convex case is\nineffective due to the presence of dimension in the convergence rate of these\nmethods. Therefore, the Shrinking Conditional Gradient method is considered.\nIts difference from the conditional gradient methods is that it uses a modified\nlinear minimization oracle. The convergence rate of such an algorithm does not\ndepend on dimension. Using the Shrinking Conditional Gradient method the\ncomplexity of solving the minimization problem of quadratic form on a $ \\infty\n$-ball is obtained. The resulting evaluation of the method is comparable to the\ncomplexity of the gradient method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Mar 2020 08:42:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-17"}

To address these two issues, we introduce a\nvariant of two-stage detectors called PS-RCNN.

We then demonstrate a fundamental limitation on the possibility of\ntransferring the privacy of random bits in quantum networks with an\nintermediate repeater station. More precisely, we provide an upper bound on the\nrate of repeated randomness in this scenario, similar to the one derived for\nprivate key repeaters. This bound holds for states with positive partial\ntransposition. We further demonstrate the power of this upper bound by showing\na gap between the localisable and the repeated private randomness for separable\nWerner states.

We explain this\nwith a model consisting of two polarized emission components: a \"jet\" that is\nconstant in time, and a \"burst\" that is variable. The EVPA of the combination\nis $\\rm EVPA_{jet}$ at both the beginning and the end of the burst, so the net\nrotation across the burst must be $n\\pi$.

The main conclusion is that the EVPA rotation can be much\nlarger than the physical rotation of the emission region around the axis of the\njet, but this requires the EVPAs of the jet and the burst to be nearly\northogonal. A shock-in-jet calculation by Zhang et al. can provide a physical\nmodel for our toy model, and in addition automatically gives the needed\northogonality.

The non-local\nstructure of fermionic Fock space necessitates encodings that either map local\nfermionic operators to non-local qubit operators, or encode the fermionic\nrepresentation in a long-range entangled code space. In this latter case, there\nis an unavoidable trade-off between two desirable properties of the encoding:\nlow weight representations of local fermionic operators, and a high distance\ncode space. Here it is argued that despite this fundamental limitation,\nfermionic encodings with low-weight representations of local fermionic\noperators can still exhibit error mitigating properties which can serve a\nsimilar role to that played by high code distances. In particular when\nundetectable errors correspond to \"natural\" fermionic noise. We illustrate this\npoint explicitly for two fermionic encodings: the Verstraete-Cirac encoding,\nand an encoding appearing in concurrent work by Derby and Klassen. In these\nencodings many, but not all, single-qubit errors can be detected. However we\nshow that the remaining undetectable single-qubit errors map to local,\nlow-weight fermionic phase noise. We argue that such noise is natural for\nfermionic lattice models. This suggests that even when employing low-weight\nfermionic encodings, error rates can be suppressed in a similar fashion to high\ndistance codes, provided one is willing to accept simulated natural fermionic\nnoise in their simulated fermionic system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Mar 2020 11:31:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Jun 2020 18:32:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-17"}

The outflow\nis dense and metal-enriched compared to the HII regions, with expansion\nvelocities larger than those obtained from UV interstellar absorption lines\nunder standard assumptions. Some of these metals may be able to escape, with\noutflows loading factors comparable to those found in high-$z$ galaxies of\nsimilar SFR/Area.

In this work, we proposed a novel\nyet simple framework, called SocialGrid, for modeling events in online\ndiscussing forms.

Based on the nature of the grid, we leverage the Temporal\nConvolution Network to learn the dynamics at the grid level. Varying the\ntemporal scope of an individual grid, the learned grid model can be used to\npredict the arrival time of future events at different granularities.\nLeveraging the Reddit data, we validate the proposed method through experiments\non a series of applications.

The main difference with previous approaches is that we do not\nrecur to the notion of probabilistic recursive feasibility, and hence we do not\nconsider separately the unfeasible case. In particular, two probabilistic\ndesign problems are envisioned. The first randomization problem aims to design\n\\textit{offline} the constraint set tightening, following an approach inherited\nfrom tube-based MPC. For the second probabilistic scheme, a specific\nprobabilistic validation approach is exploited for tuning the penalty\nparameter, to be selected \\textit{offline} among a finite-family of possible\nvalues. The simple algorithm here proposed allows designing a \\textit{single}\ncontroller, always guaranteeing feasibility of the online optimization problem.\nThe proposed method is shown to be more computationally tractable than previous\nschemes. This is due to the fact that the sample complexity for both\nprobabilistic design problems depends on the prediction horizon in a\nlogarithmic way, unlike scenario-based approaches which exhibit linear\ndependence.

The electric field is\ncreated by spraying charges on the major faces of the plate: although in\npractice this mode of actuation is harder to achieve than a voltage-driven\ndeformation, here we find that it turns out to be much more stable in theory\nand in simulations.\n  First we show that the electromechanical instability based on the Hessian\ncriterion associated with the free energy of the system does not occur at all\nfor charge-driven dielectrics for which the electric displacement is linear in\nthe electric field. Then we show that the geometric instability associated with\nthe formation of small-amplitude wrinkles on the faces of the plate that arises\nunder voltage control does not occur either under charge control. This is in\ncomplete contrast to voltage-control actuation, where Hessian and wrinkling\ninstabilities can occur once certain critical voltages are reached.\n  For the mechanical pre-stresses, two modes that can be implemented in\npractice are used: equi-biaxial and uni-axial.

We focus here on vacation trips (for all\ntransportation modes) during the Chinese Lunar New Year and compare the results\nfor 2019 with the ones for 2020 where travel bans were applied for mitigating\nthe spread of a novel coronavirus (COVID-19). We first show that these travel\nflows are broadly distributed and display both large temporal and spatial\nfluctuations, making their modeling very difficult. When flows are larger, they\nappear to be more dispersed over a larger number of origins and destinations,\ncreating de facto hubs that can spread an epidemic at a large scale. These\nmovements quickly induce (in about a week) a very strong population\nconcentration in a small set of cities. We characterize quantitatively the\nreturn to the initial distribution by defining a pendular ratio which allows us\nto show that this dynamics is very slow and even stopped for the 2020 Lunar New\nYear due to travel restrictions. Travel restrictions obviously limit the spread\nof the diseases between different cities, but have thus the counter-effect of\nkeeping high concentration in a small set of cities, a priori favoring\nintra-city spread, unless individual contacts are strongly limited. These\nresults shed some light on how interurban movements modify the national\ndistribution of populations, a crucial ingredient for devising effective\ncontrol strategies at a national level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Mar 2020 15:14:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-17"}

Those protons constitute a variable, unpredictable component of\nthe non X-ray background that strongly affects astronomical observations and a\ncorrect estimation of their flux at the focal plane is then essential. For this\nreason, we investigate how they are scattered from the mirror surfaces when\nimpacting with grazing angles.

Monitoring of BL Lacertae at 15 GHz with the Very Long Baseline\nArray (VLBA) has revealed a quasi-stationary radio feature in the innermost\npart of the jet, at 0.26 mas from the radio core. Stationary features are found\nin many blazars, but they have rarely been explored in detail. Aims. We aim to\nstudy the kinematics, dynamics, and brightness of the quasi-stationary feature\nof the jet in BL Lacertae based on VLBA monitoring with submilliarcsecond\nresolution (subparsec-scales) over 17 years. Methods. We analysed position\nuncertainties and flux leakage effects of the innermost quasi-stationary\nfeature and developed statistical tools to distinguish the motions of the\nstationary feature and the radio core. We constructed a toy model to simulate\nthe observed emission of the quasi-stationary component. Results. We find that\ntrajectories of the quasi-stationary component are aligned along the jet axis,\nwhich can be interpreted as evidence of the displacements of the radio core.\nThe intrinsic motions of the core and quasi-stationary component have a\ncommensurate contribution to the apparent motion of the stationary component.\nDuring the jet-stable state, the core shift significantly influences the\napparent displacements of the stationary component, which shows orbiting motion\nwith reversals. The quasi-stationary component has low superluminal speeds on\ntime scales of months. On time-scales of few years, the apparent mean speeds\nare subrelativistic, of about 0.15 the speed of light. We find that the\nbrightness profile of the quasi-stationary component is asymmetric along and\ntransverse to the jet axis, and this effect remains unchanged regardless of\nepoch. Conclusions. Accurate positional determination, a high cadence of\nobservations, and a proper accounting for the core shift are crucial for the\nmeasurement of the trajectories and speeds of the quasi-stationary component.\n(abbrev.)\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Mar 2020 12:21:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2020 22:30:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-19"}

Typical methods proposed for time series forecasting modeled\nlinear or non-linear dependencies between data observations. However it is a\ngenerally accepted notion that no one method is universally effective for all\nkinds of time series data. Attempts have been made to use dynamic and weighted\ncombination of heterogeneous and independent forecasting models and it has been\nfound to be a promising direction to tackle this problem.

The cubed-sphere\nremapping minimizes the distortion on the cube faces on which convolution\noperations are performed and provides natural boundary conditions for padding\nin the CNN.

On annual time\nscales, our model produces a realistic seasonal cycle driven solely by the\nprescribed variation in top-of-atmosphere solar forcing. Although it is\ncurrently less accurate than operational weather forecasting models, our\ndata-driven CNN executes much faster than those models, suggesting that machine\nlearning could prove to be a valuable tool for large-ensemble forecasting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Mar 2020 19:57:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-14"}

It collaboratively runs a deep neural network model where the model is\nsplit into two parts, one for the client and the other for the server.\nTherefore, the server has no direct access to raw data processed at the client.\nUntil now, the split learning is believed to be a promising approach to protect\nthe client's raw data; for example, the client's data was protected in\nhealthcare image applications using 2D convolutional neural network (CNN)\nmodels. However, it is still unclear whether the split learning can be applied\nto other deep learning models, in particular, 1D CNN.\n  In this paper, we examine whether split learning can be used to perform\nprivacy-preserving training for 1D CNN models. To answer this, we first design\nand implement an 1D CNN model under split learning and validate its efficacy in\ndetecting heart abnormalities using medical ECG data. We observed that the 1D\nCNN model under split learning can achieve the same accuracy of 98.9\\% like the\noriginal (non-split) model. However, our evaluation demonstrates that split\nlearning may fail to protect the raw data privacy on 1D CNN models. To address\nthe observed privacy leakage in split learning, we adopt two privacy leakage\nmitigation techniques: 1) adding more hidden layers to the client side and 2)\napplying differential privacy. Although those mitigation techniques are helpful\nin reducing privacy leakage, they have a significant impact on model accuracy.\nHence, based on those results, we conclude that split learning alone would not\nbe sufficient to maintain the confidentiality of raw sequential data in 1D CNN\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Mar 2020 06:06:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-30"}

The number of\nsub-formulas of any formula is linear on the size of it, and hence any\nexponentially big proof has a size $a^n$, where $a>1$ and $n$ is the size of\nits conclusion.
