CPO\naims at generating a set of flight sequences (crew pairings) covering a\nflight-schedule, at minimum-cost, while satisfying several legality\nconstraints. For large-scale complex flight networks, billion-plus legal\npairings (variables) are possible, rendering their offline enumeration\nintractable and an exhaustive search for their minimum-cost full\nflight-coverage subset impractical. Even generating an initial feasible\nsolution (IFS: a manageable set of legal pairings covering all flights), which\ncould be subsequently optimized is a difficult (NP-complete) problem. Though,\nas part of a larger project the authors have developed a crew pairing optimizer\n(AirCROP), this paper dedicatedly focuses on IFS-generation through a novel\nheuristic based on divide-and-cover strategy and Integer Programming. For\nreal-world large and complex flight network datasets (including over 3200\nflights and 15 crew bases) provided by GE Aviation, the proposed heuristic\nshows upto a ten-fold speed improvement over another state-of-the-art approach.\nUnprecedentedly, this paper presents an empirical investigation of the impact\nof IFS-cost on the final (optimized) solution-cost, revealing that too low an\nIFS-cost does not necessarily imply faster convergence for AirCROP or even\nlower cost for the optimized solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Mar 2020 08:21:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-17"}

The first one concerns a\npoint set $S$ of size $q+1$ in the classical projective plane $PG(2,q)$, where\nthe intersection distribution of $S$ indicates the intersection pattern between\n$S$ and the lines in $PG(2,q)$. The second one relates to a polynomial $f$ over\na finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$, where the intersection distribution of $f$\nrecords an overall distribution property of a collection of polynomials\n$\\{f(x)+cx \\mid c \\in \\mathbb{F}_q\\}$. These two perspectives are closely\nrelated, in the sense that each polynomial produces a $(q+1)$-set in a\ncanonical way and conversely, each $(q+1)$-set with certain property has a\npolynomial representation. Indeed, the intersection distribution provides a new\nangle to distinguish polynomials over finite fields, based on the geometric\nproperty of the corresponding $(q+1)$-sets. Among the intersection\ndistribution, we identify a particularly interesting quantity named non-hitting\nindex. For a point set $S$, its non-hitting index counts the number of lines in\n$PG(2,q)$ which do not hit $S$. For a polynomial $f$ over a finite field\n$\\mathbb{F}_q$, its non-hitting index gives the summation of the sizes of $q$\nvalue sets $\\{f(x)+cx \\mid x \\in \\mathbb{F}_q\\}$, where $c \\in \\mathbb{F}_q$.\nWe derive bounds on the non-hitting index and show that the non-hitting index\ncontains much information about the corresponding set and the polynomial. More\nprecisely, using a geometric approach, we show that the non-hitting index is\nsufficient to characterize the corresponding point set and the polynomial when\nit is close to the lower and upper bounds.

For group families, the procedure is to be\nimplemented after preliminary reduction of the data via invariance.This\nproperty allows for calculation of exact critical values and p-values at finite\nsample sizes. Applications include testing for location--scale families and\ntesting for families arising from affine transformations, such as elliptical\ndistributions with given standard radial density and unspecified location\nvector and scatter matrix. A novel test for multivariate normality with\nunspecified mean vector and covariance matrix arises as a special case. For\nmore general parametric families, we propose a parametric bootstrap procedure\nto calculate critical values. The lack of asymptotic distribution theory for\nthe empirical Wasserstein distance means that the validity of the parametric\nbootstrap under the null hypothesis remains a conjecture.

Calculations of the\nformation energies and the evolution of the energies of the charge carrier\nplasmons as a function of the potassium content show that certain, low\npotassium concentrations $x$ are thermodynamically unstable. This leads to the\ncoexistence of undoped and doped domains if the provided amount of the alkali\nmetal is insufficient to saturate the whole crystal with the minimum\nthermodynamically stable potassium stoichiometry. Beyond this threshold\nconcentration the domains disappear, while the alkali metal and charge carrier\nconcentrations increase continuously upon further addition of potassium. At low\nintercalation levels, electron diffraction patterns indicate a significant\ndegree of disorder in the crystal structure. The initial order in the\nout-of-plane direction is restored at high $x$ while the crystal layer\nthicknesses expand by 33-36%. Superstructures emerge parallel to the planes\nwhich we attribute to the distribution of the alkali metal rather than\nstructural changes of the host materials. The in-plane lattice parameters\nchange by not more than 1%. The introduction of potassium causes the formation\nof charge carrier plasmons. The observation of this semiconductor-to-metal\ntransition is supported by calculations of the density of states (DOS) and band\nstructures as well as angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. The calculated\nDOS hint at the presence of an almost ideal two-dimensional electron gas at the\nFermi level for $x<0.6$. The plasmons exhibit quadratic momentum dispersions\nwhich is in agreement with the behavior expected for an ideal electron gas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 14 Mar 2020 20:38:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

Partial domain adaptation (PDA) investigates the scenarios in which\nthe source domain is large and diverse, and the target label space is a subset\nof the source label space. The main purpose of PDA is to identify the shared\nclasses between the domains and promote learning transferable knowledge from\nthese classes.

The proposed approach jointly aligns the marginal and\nclass-conditional distributions in the shared label space by minimaxing a novel\nmulti-class adversarial loss function. Furthermore, we incorporate effective\nregularization terms to encourage selecting the most relevant subset of source\ndomain classes. In the absence of target labels, the proposed approach is able\nto effectively learn domain-invariant feature representations, which in turn\ncan enhance the classification performance in the target domain.

It also enables them to view objects from different\ndistances and viewpoints, providing a rich visual experience from which to\nlearn abstract representations of the environment. Inspired by the primate\nvisual-motor system, we present a framework that leverages the benefits of\nactive perception to accomplish manipulation tasks. Our agent uses viewpoint\nchanges to localize objects, to learn state representations in a\nself-supervised manner, and to perform goal-directed actions. We apply our\nmodel to a simulated grasping task with a 6-DoF action space. Compared to its\npassive, fixed-camera counterpart, the active model achieves 8% better\nperformance in targeted grasping. Compared to vanilla deep Q-learning\nalgorithms, our model is at least four times more sample-efficient,\nhighlighting the benefits of both active perception and representation\nlearning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Mar 2020 01:43:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-17"}

A physics-based simulator allows a planner to reason about the\neffects of interactions with these objects and to generate a plan that grasps\nthe milk container successfully. The use of physics-based simulation for\nplanning however is underutilized.

We\nhave recently proposed state-interaction pair-density functional theory\n(SI-PDFT) to treat nearly degenerate states; although this method is\nsuccessful, it is inconvenient because two SCF calculations and two sets of\norbitals are required and because it puts the ground state on an unequal\nfooting with the excited states.

When the correspondences between 2D and 3D points are not known a\npriori, the task becomes the much more challenging blind PnP problem. This\npaper proposes a deep CNN model which simultaneously solves for both the 6-DoF\nabsolute camera pose and 2D--3D correspondences. Our model comprises three\nneural modules connected in sequence. First, a two-stream PointNet-inspired\nnetwork is applied directly to both the 2D image keypoints and the 3D scene\npoints in order to extract discriminative point-wise features harnessing both\nlocal and contextual information. Second, a global feature matching module is\nemployed to estimate a matchability matrix among all 2D--3D pairs. Third, the\nobtained matchability matrix is fed into a classification module to\ndisambiguate inlier matches. The entire network is trained end-to-end, followed\nby a robust model fitting (P3P-RANSAC) at test time only to recover the 6-DoF\ncamera pose.

The backbone of MotionNet is a novel spatio-temporal pyramid\nnetwork, which extracts deep spatial and temporal features in a hierarchical\nfashion.

While most of the current research focus on the\ndesign of low PAPR CSSs to improve the code-rate, few works address the\naforementioned SNC in their designs. This motivates us to investigate CSSs with\nSNC as well as low PAPR property. In this paper, we present systematic\nconstructions of CSSs under SNCs and low PAPR.

Also, while a naked singularity with a photon sphere can cast a\nshadow, it could also admit positive perihelion precession for such orbits,\nthereby mimicking a black hole. This indicates that compact objects with photon\nspheres (shadows) always admit positive perihelion precession of timelike bound\norbits around them.

However, recent works point out that the existing ring signature\nscheme is vulnerable to the \"chain-reaction\" analysis (i.e., the spent coin in\na given ring signature can be deduced through elimination). Especially, when\nthe diversity of mixins is low, the spent coin will have a high risk to be\ndetected. To overcome the weakness, the ring signature should be consisted of a\nset of mixins with high diversity and produce observations having \"similar\"\ndistributions for any two coins. In this paper, we propose a notion, namely\n$\\epsilon$-coin-indistinguishability ($\\epsilon$-CI), to formally define the\n\"similar\" distribution guaranteed through a differential privacy scheme. Then,\nwe formally define the CI-aware mixins selection problem with disjoint-superset\nconstraint (CIA-MS-DS), which aims to find a mixin set that has maximal\ndiversity and satisfies the constraints of $\\epsilon$-CI and the budget. In\nCIA-MS-DS, each ring signature is either disjoint with or the superset of its\npreceding ring signatures. We prove that CIA-MS-DS is NP-hard and thus\nintractable. To solve the CIA-MS-DS problem, we propose two approximation\nalgorithms, namely the Progressive Algorithm and the Game Theoretic Algorithm,\nwith theoretic guarantees.

To obtain the\nsingle-frame supervision, the annotators are asked to identify only a single\nframe within the temporal window of an action. This can significantly reduce\nthe labor cost of obtaining full supervision which requires annotating the\naction boundary. Compared to the weak supervision that only annotates the\nvideo-level label, the single-frame supervision introduces extra temporal\naction signals while maintaining low annotation overhead. To make full use of\nsuch single-frame supervision, we propose a unified system called SF-Net.\nFirst, we propose to predict an actionness score for each video frame. Along\nwith a typical category score, the actionness score can provide comprehensive\ninformation about the occurrence of a potential action and aid the temporal\nboundary refinement during inference. Second, we mine pseudo action and\nbackground frames based on the single-frame annotations. We identify pseudo\naction frames by adaptively expanding each annotated single frame to its\nnearby, contextual frames and we mine pseudo background frames from all the\nunannotated frames across multiple videos. Together with the ground-truth\nlabeled frames, these pseudo-labeled frames are further used for training the\nclassifier. In extensive experiments on THUMOS14, GTEA, and BEOID, SF-Net\nsignificantly improves upon state-of-the-art weakly-supervised methods in terms\nof both segment localization and single-frame localization. Notably, SF-Net\nachieves comparable results to its fully-supervised counterpart which requires\nmuch more resource intensive annotations.

To address this problem, we present a\nsupervised aspect-based opinion mining method that utilizes labeled data from a\nforeign language (English in this case), which is translated to Vietnamese by\nan automated translation tool (Google Translate). Because aspects and opinions\nin different languages may be expressed by different words, we propose using\nword embeddings, in addition to other features, to reduce the vocabulary\ndifference between the original and translated texts, thus improving the\neffectiveness of aspect category extraction and sentiment polarity\nclassification processes. We also introduce an annotated corpus of aspect\ncategories and sentiment polarities extracted from restaurant reviews in\nVietnamese, and conduct a series of experiments on the corpus. Experimental\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Mar 2020 15:53:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-17"}

We\ndemonstrated the efficiency of our method through estimation of the interface\nenergy and lattice mismatch between MgZn2 and {\\alpha}-Mg phases in an Mg-based\nalloy. The results showed that the sampling cost required to obtain accurate\nLER estimation could be drastically reduced.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 15 Mar 2020 04:14:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-19"}
