Research in Natural\nLanguage Processing (NLP) also had a leap forward in 2018 since the release of\nthe pre-trained contextual neural language models such as BERT and recently\nreleased GPT3. Despite the exciting AI applications aforementioned, AI is still\nsignificantly lagging behind humans in creativity, which is often considered\nthe ultimate moonshot for AI. Our work is inspired by Chinese calligraphy,\nwhich is a unique form of visual art where the character itself is an aesthetic\npainting. We also draw inspirations from paintings of the Abstract\nExpressionist movement in the 1940s and 1950s, such as the work by American\npainter Franz Kline. In this paper, we present a creative framework based on\nConditional Generative Adversarial Networks and Contextual Neural Language\nModel to generate abstract artworks that have intrinsic meaning and aesthetic\nvalue, which is different from the existing work, such as image captioning and\ntext-to-image generation, where the texts are the descriptions of the images.\nIn addition, we have publicly released a Chinese calligraphy image dataset and\ndemonstrate our framework using a prototype system and a user study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2020 16:24:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-03"}

The TGV\nis a benchmark case for transitional flows in which the onset of turbulence is\ndriven by vortex-stretching and reconnection mechanisms. Since these physical\nphenomena are observed in numerous flows of variable-density, this study\nconstitutes the first step toward extending the PANS method to such a class of\nproblems. We start by deriving the governing equations of the model and analyze\nthe selection of the parameters controlling its physical resolution, fe and fk,\nthrough a-priori testing. Afterward, we conduct PANS computations at different\nconstant physical resolutions to evaluate the model's accuracy and cost\npredicting the TGV flow. This is performed through simple verification and\nvalidation exercises, and the physical and modeling interpretation of the\nnumerical predictions. The results confirm that PANS can efficiently (accuracy\nvs. cost) predict the present flow problem. Yet, this is closely dependent on\nthe physical resolution of the model. Whereas high-physical resolution\n(fk<0.50) computations are in good agreement with the reference DNS studies,\nlow-physical resolution (fk>=0.50) simulations lead to large discrepancies with\nthe reference data.

The comparison of the computations' cost indicates\nthat high-physical resolution PANS achieves the accuracy of DNS (fk=0.00) at a\nfraction of the cost.

This rescaled Einstein-Hilbert scalar field theory at early times\nalters the inflationary phenomenology of well-known scalar field models of\ninflation, but more importantly, in the context of this rescaled theory, the\nSwampland criteria are easily satisfied, assuming that the scalar field is\nslowly rolling.

However,\noverlapping cells can cause incorrect predicted results, and so they have to be\nseparated into multiple single RBCs before classifying. To classify multiple\nclasses with deep learning, imbalance problems are common in medical imaging\nbecause normal samples are always higher than rare disease samples. This paper\npresents a new method to segment and classify RBCs from blood smear images,\nspecifically to tackle cell overlapping and data imbalance problems. Focusing\non overlapping cell separation, our segmentation process first estimates\nellipses to represent RBCs. The method detects the concave points and then\nfinds the ellipses using directed ellipse fitting. The accuracy from 20 blood\nsmear images was 0.889. Classification requires balanced training datasets.\nHowever, some RBC types are rare. The imbalance ratio of this dataset was\n34.538 for 12 RBC classes from 20,875 individual RBC samples. The use of\nmachine learning for RBC classification with an imbalanced dataset is hence\nmore challenging than many other applications. We analyzed techniques to deal\nwith this problem.

We consider a single electron in a\nsilicon quantum dot-donor device interacting with a microwave resonator via the\nelectric dipole coupling and subjected to a homogeneous magnetic field and a\ntransverse magnetic field gradient. In our scenario, the electron spin\ninteracts with a $^{31}\\mathrm{P}$ defect nuclear spin via the hyperfine\ninteraction.

In this paper,\nwe report on details of the Model Counting Competition 2020, about carrying out\nthe competition, and the results. The competition encompassed three versions of\nthe model counting problem, which we evaluated in separate tracks. The first\ntrack featured the model counting problem (MC), which asks for the number of\nmodels of a given Boolean formula. On the second track, we challenged\ndevelopers to submit programs that solve the weighted model counting problem\n(WMC). The last track was dedicated to projected model counting (PMC).

The overall distribution\nof the [CI] emission in this cluster is similar to that of the $^{13}$CO\nemission.

The fully conservative\nscheme suppresses anomalous accelerations that arise when applying a common\nnumerical discretization of the gravitational stress tensor that does not\nguarantee curl-free gravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2020 17:21:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-17"}

For spiral galaxies, there is a distinct and rare population of\nsuper-soft sources, largely detached from the rest of sources on the\n$kT_{bb}-L_X$ plane. The boundary between these sources and the much more\nnumerous population of harder (but still soft) sources is consistent with the\nboundary of stable hydrogen burning on the white dwarf surface.

Experimental analysis on the public Recipe1M\ndataset shows that the representation learned via the proposed method\nsignificantly outperforms the current state-of-the-arts (SOTA) on retrieval\ntasks. Furthermore, the representational power of the learned representation is\ndemonstrated through a generative food image synthesis model conditioned on\nrecipe embeddings.

We propose\na Gaussian process (GP)-based method to tackle the temporal overfitting\nproblem. Our model is partitioned into two parts -- a time-invariant component\nand a time-varying component, each of which is modeled through a GP. We modify\nthe inference method to a thinning-based strategy, an idea borrowed from Markov\nchain Monte Carlo sampling, to overcome temporal overfitting and estimate the\ntime-invariant component. We extensively compare our proposed method with both\nexisting power curve models and available ideas for handling temporal\noverfitting on real wind turbine datasets. Our approach yields significant\nimprovement when predicting response for a time period different from the\ntraining time period.

Almost all conventional methods only\nfocus on improving accuracy with minimal parameter update, while ignoring high\ncomputing and memory cost during training, which makes it difficult to deploy\nmulti-domain learning into more and more widely used resource-limited edge\ndevices, like mobile phones, IoT, embedded systems, etc. We observe that large\nmemory used for activation storage is the bottleneck that largely limits the\ntraining time and cost on edge devices. To reduce training memory usage, while\nkeeping the domain adaption accuracy performance, we propose Dynamic Additive\nAttention Adaption ($DA^3$), a novel memory-efficient on-device multi-domain\nlearning method. $DA^3$ learns a novel additive attention adaptor module, while\nfreezing the weights of the pre-trained backbone model for each domain.\nDifferentiating from prior works, such module not only mitigates activation\nmemory buffering for reducing memory usage during training but also serves as a\ndynamic gating mechanism to reduce the computation cost for fast inference. We\nvalidate $DA^3$ on multiple datasets against state-of-the-art methods, which\nshows great improvement in both accuracy and training time. Moreover, we\ndeployed $DA^3$ into the popular NIVDIA Jetson Nano edge GPU, where the\nmeasured experimental results show our proposed $DA^3$ reduces the on-device\ntraining memory consumption by 19-37x, and training time by 2x, in comparison\nto the baseline methods (e.g., standard fine-tuning, Parallel and Series Res.\nadaptor, and Piggyback).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2020 18:03:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Mar 2021 20:13:15 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 6 Oct 2021 17:37:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-07"}

It\nhas been theorized for decades that the required heating mechanisms of the\nchromospheric and coronal parts of the active regions, quiet-Sun, and coronal\nholes are associated with the solar magnetic fields. However, the exact\nphysical process that transport and dissipate the magnetic energy which\nultimately leads to the solar plasma heating are not yet fully understood. The\ncurrent understanding of coronal heating relies on two main mechanism:\nreconnection and MHD waves that may have various degrees of importance in\ndifferent coronal regions. In this review we focus on recent advances in our\nunderstanding of MHD wave heating mechanisms. First, we focus on giving an\noverview of observational results, where we show that different wave modes have\nbeen discovered in the corona in the last decade, many of which are associated\nwith a significant energy flux, either generated in situ or pumped from the\nlower solar atmosphere. Afterwards, we summarise the recent findings of\nnumerical modelling of waves, motivated by the observational results. Despite\nthe advances, only 3D MHD models with Alfv\\'en wave heating in an unstructured\ncorona can explain the observed coronal temperatures compatible with the quiet\nSun, while 3D MHD wave heating models including cross-field density structuring\nare not yet able to account for the heating of coronal loops in active regions\nto their observed temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2020 18:13:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-09"}

For many of these reasons, the correlated-k\napproach has become very popular. Its major weakness has been the lack of ways\nto adapt the spectral grid/resolution of precomputed k-coefficients, making it\ndifficult to distribute a generic database suited for many different\napplications. Currently, most users still need to have access to a line-by-line\ntransfer code with the relevant line lists or high-resolution cross sections to\ncompute k-coefficient tables at the desired resolution. In this work, we\ndemonstrate that precomputed k-coefficients can be binned to a lower spectral\nresolution without any additional assumptions, and show how this can be done in\npractice. We then show that this binning procedure does not introduce any\nsignificant loss in accuracy. Along the way, we quantify how such an approach\ncompares very favorably with the sampled cross section approach. This opens up\na new avenue to deliver accurate radiative transfer data by providing\nmid-resolution k-coefficient tables to users who can later tailor those tables\nto their needs on the fly. To help with this final step, we briefly present\nExo_k, an open-access, open-source Python library designed to handle, tailor,\nand use many different formats of k-coefficient and cross-section tables in an\neasy and computationally efficient way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2020 19:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-06"}

In this article, we\npresent a hydrodynamic theory of the connected spectral form factor prior to\nthe inverse level spacing time. We start from a discussion of exact symmetries\nand spectral stretching and folding. We then derive a general formula for the\nspectral form factor of a system with almost-conserved sectors in terms of\nreturn probabilities and spectral form factors within each sector. Next we\nargue that the theory of fluctuating hydrodynamics can be adapted from the\nusual Schwinger-Keldysh contour to the periodic time setting needed for the\nspectral form factor, and we show explicitly that the general formula is\nrecovered in the case of energy diffusion.

The proposed method conceptualizes a time-series as a\nseries of stationary, electrically charged particles, on which Coulomb-like\nforces can be computed. This allows generating electrostatic-like graphs\nassociated to time-series that, additionally to the existing transformations,\ncan be also weighted and sometimes disconnected. Within this context, the paper\nexamines the structural relevance between five different types of time-series\nand their associated graphs generated by the proposed algorithm and the\nvisibility graph, which is currently the most established algorithm in the\nliterature. The analysis compares the source time-series with the network-based\nnode-series generated by network measures that are arranged into the\nnode-ordering of the source time-series, in terms of linearity, chaotic\nbehaviour, stationarity, periodicity, and cyclical structure. It is shown that\nthe proposed electrostatic graph algorithm produces graphs that are more\nrelevant to the structure of the source time-series by introducing a\ntransformation that converts the time-series to graphs. This is more natural\nrather than algebraic, in comparison with existing physics-defined methods. The\noverall approach also suggests a methodological framework for evaluating the\nstructural relevance between the source time-series and their associated graphs\nproduced by any possible transformation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2020 19:52:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-04"}

In this\nperiod cyclists were facilitated in distancing by the widening of cycle paths,\nor the use of car lanes. The Corona measures also affected intersection\ncontrol, since one of the principles of signalizing is based on clustering of\ntraffic. The settings of the control take into account the way cyclists tend to\ncluster close together at the stop line, so for optimal control, if the\nclustering changes, the control should be adapted as well. This paper presents\nmeasures for 'Corona-safe' intersection control for cyclists, and discusses the\neffect of the measures and their (dis)advantages. Further it was investigated\nhow some municipalities used these measures and conveyed about it in the media\nand how these measures were received by the public. The measures can be divided\nin two groups: detection and timing. For the municipalities considered, the\nleast popular measures concerned the detection methods, such as adaptations in\nuse, or type, of push button, since the negative aspects can be large (effect\non throughput and costs). More popular were changes in the timing of the\ncontrol, the most conveyed measures being more frequent and longer green for\ncyclists. The acceptance of the measures by the public (determined via\nreactions on social media) is mixed, some are positive about the improved\ncontrol, others negative (effect on car traffic or costs). The most common\nreactions are general complaints about intersection control, and about cyclists\nbehaviour. For future use the measure 'more frequent green' is most suitable,\npermitted cyclists are detected to support the acceptance of the control. Also\nbicycle apps can be applied, since these results in more comfort and have\nlimited negative effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2020 19:53:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-04"}

The proposed method is not only\ncomputationally more efficient than existing TD-gPC-based methods but is also\nfar more accurate. The FSC method uses the concept of 'enriched stochastic flow\nmaps' to track the evolution of a finite-dimensional random function space\nefficiently in time. To transfer the probability information from one random\nfunction space to another, two approaches are developed and studied herein. In\nthe first approach, the probability information is transferred in the\nmean-square sense, whereas in the second approach the transfer is done exactly\nusing a new theorem that was developed for this purpose. The FSC method can\nquantify uncertainties with high fidelity, especially for the long-time\nresponse of stochastic dynamical systems governed by ODEs of arbitrary order.\nSix representative numerical examples, including a nonlinear problem (the\nVan-der-Pol oscillator), are presented to demonstrate the performance of the\nFSC method and corroborate the claims of its superior numerical properties.\nFinally, a parametric, high-dimensional stochastic problem is used to\ndemonstrate that when the FSC method is used in conjunction with Monte Carlo\nintegration, the curse of dimensionality can be overcome altogether.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2020 19:58:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Dec 2020 23:47:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 10 Jan 2021 19:06:13 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 21 Jul 2022 03:06:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-22"}

Our results suggest that there is no\nsingle global property of a cloud that determines its ability to form massive\nstars, although we find combined trends of increasing mass, size, surface\ndensity and velocity dispersion for the sub-sample of clouds with ongoing\nhigh-mass star formation. We then isolate the most extreme clouds in the\nSEDIGISM sample (i.e. clouds in the tails of the distributions) to look at\ntheir overall Galactic distribution, in search for hints of environmental\neffects. We find that, for most properties, the Galactic distribution of the\nmost extreme clouds is only marginally different to that of the global cloud\npopulation. The Galactic distribution of the largest clouds, the turbulent\nclouds and the high-mass star-forming clouds are those that deviate most\nsignificantly from the global cloud population. We also find that the least\ndynamically active clouds (with low velocity dispersion or low virial\nparameter) are situated further afield, mostly in the least populated areas.\nHowever, we suspect that part of these trends may be affected by some\nobservational biases, and thus require further follow up work in order to be\nconfirmed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2020 20:08:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-09"}

Despite their practical realization and successful commercialization,\nthe sensitivity and associated precision of plasmonic sensors are starting to\nreach their fundamental classical limit given by quantum fluctuations of light\n-- known as the shot-noise limit. To improve the sensing performance of these\nsensors beyond the classical limit, quantum resources are increasingly being\nemployed.

For 1.5 billion of those sources,\nparallaxes, proper motions, and the (G_BP-G_RP) colour are also available. The\npassbands for G, G_BP, and G_RP are provided as part of the release. For ease\nof use, the 7 million radial velocities from Gaia DR2 are included in this\nrelease, after the removal of a small number of spurious values. New radial\nvelocities will appear as part of Gaia DR3. Finally, Gaia EDR3 represents an\nupdated materialisation of the celestial reference frame (CRF) in the optical,\nthe Gaia-CRF3, which is based solely on extragalactic sources. The creation of\nthe source list for Gaia EDR3 includes enhancements that make it more robust\nwith respect to high proper motion stars, and the disturbing effects of\nspurious and partially resolved sources. The source list is largely the same as\nthat for Gaia DR2, but it does feature new sources and there are some notable\nchanges. The source list will not change for Gaia DR3. Gaia EDR3 represents a\nsignificant advance over Gaia DR2, with parallax precisions increased by 30\npercent, proper motion precisions increased by a factor of 2, and the\nsystematic errors in the astrometry suppressed by 30--40 percent for the\nparallaxes and by a factor ~2.5 for the proper motions. The photometry also\nfeatures increased precision, but above all much better homogeneity across\ncolour, magnitude, and celestial position. A single passband for G, G_BP, and\nG_RP is valid over the entire magnitude and colour range, with no systematics\nabove the 1 percent level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2020 21:15:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Jun 2021 06:49:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-26"}

For each training sample the LS\nstrategy smooths the one-hot encoded training signal by distributing its\ndistribution mass over the non ground-truth classes, aiming to penalize the\nnetworks from generating overconfident output distributions. This paper\nintroduces a novel label smoothing technique called Pairwise Label Smoothing\n(PLS). The PLS takes a pair of samples as input. Smoothing with a pair of\nground-truth labels enables the PLS to preserve the relative distance between\nthe two truth labels while further soften that between the truth labels and the\nother targets, resulting in models producing much less confident predictions\nthan the LS strategy. Also, unlike current LS methods, which typically require\nto find a global smoothing distribution mass through cross-validation search,\nPLS automatically learns the distribution mass for each input pair during\ntraining. We empirically show that PLS significantly outperforms LS and the\nbaseline models, achieving up to 30% of relative classification error\nreduction.

Principal stratification characterizes such a mechanism by targeting\nsubgroup causal effects within principal strata, which are defined by the joint\npotential values of an intermediate variable. Due to the fundamental problem of\ncausal inference, principal strata are inherently latent, rendering it\nchallenging to identify and estimate subgroup effects within them. A line of\nresearch leverages the principal ignorability assumption that the latent\nprincipal strata are mean independent of the potential outcomes conditioning on\nthe observed covariates. Under principal ignorability, we derive various\nnonparametric identification formulas for causal effects within principal\nstrata in observational studies, which motivate estimators relying on the\ncorrect specifications of different parts of the observed-data distribution.\nAppropriately combining these estimators yields triply robust estimators for\nthe causal effects within principal strata.

First, the impact of using a fully compositional model\nin the context of thermal simulations is considered. Detailed phase behavior\nmodels rely on compositional descriptions of the oil using up to tens of\ncomponents. Lumping a large number of components into a smaller number of\npseudo-components in order to reduce the computational cost is standard\npractice for thermal simulations. Lumping schemes are typically calibrated\nusing experimental data, in order to achieve a good approximation of the phase\nbehavior of the initial oil. Due to the evaporation and condensation of\ncomponents under thermal stimulation, the oil composition will widely vary in\ntime and space. This works illustrates that even if the lumped schemes were\nable to capture the phase behavior of the initial oil, the lack of resolution\ncan lead to modeling artefacts and/or fail to capture the relevant displacement\nprocesses. Then, the effects of different compositional interpretations of the\nlumped pseudo-species appearing in typical reaction schemes are investigated. A\nconstant, mass-based fraction of the oil is allowed to react, and the reactive\ncomponents are modified. Due to molecular weight effects, the reaction rate is\nlarger when light and medium components are allowed to react. Those effects\nresult in an increased displacement, leading to faster fronts, larger oil banks\nand more pressurization of the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Dec 2020 00:43:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Jul 2021 04:29:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-03"}

Such asymmetry has been observed\nfrom a psychoanalysis test called word evocation experiment, where one word is\nused to recall another. Although useful, such experimental data have been\nsignificantly understudied for measuring embedding quality. In this paper, we\nuse three well-known evocation datasets to gain insights into asymmetry\nencoding of embedding. We study both static embedding as well as contextual\nembedding, such as BERT. Evaluating asymmetry for BERT is generally hard due to\nthe dynamic nature of embedding. Thus, we probe BERT's conditional\nprobabilities (as a language model) using a large number of Wikipedia contexts\nto derive a theoretically justifiable Bayesian asymmetry score. The result\nshows that contextual embedding shows randomness than static embedding on\nsimilarity judgments while performing well on asymmetry judgment, which aligns\nwith its strong performance on \"extrinsic evaluations\" such as text\nclassification. The asymmetry judgment and the Bayesian approach provides a new\nperspective to evaluate contextual embedding on intrinsic evaluation, and its\ncomparison to similarity evaluation concludes our work with a discussion on the\ncurrent state and the future of representation learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Dec 2020 01:48:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-04"}

Apart from deterministic safety and liveness\nguarantees standard in BFT protocols, the egalitarian design provides two novel\nfeatures: (i) EBFT is resilient to attacks targeting the leader, such as\nbribery and targeted DoS attacks, and (ii) EBFT does not require any fail-over\nprotocol to detect and replace the faulty leader.

Here, we focus on the\neffect of the ubiquitous neuronal heterogeneity on the synchronization of PING\n(pyramidal-interneuronal network gamma) and ING (interneuronal network gamma)\nrhythms. The synchronization properties of rhythms depends on the response of\ntheir collective phase to external input. We therefore determined the\nmacroscopic phase-response curve for finite-amplitude perturbations (fmPRC),\nusing numerical simulation of all-to-all coupled networks of integrate-and-fire\n(IF) neurons exhibiting either PING or ING rhythms. We show that the intrinsic\nneuronal heterogeneity can qualitatively modify the fmPRC. While the\nphase-response curve for the individual IF-neurons is strictly positive (type\nI), the fmPRC can be biphasic and exhibit both signs (type II). Thus, for PING\nrhythms, an external excitation to the excitatory cells can, in fact, delay the\ncollective oscillation of the network, even though the same excitation would\nlead to an advance when applied to uncoupled neurons. This paradoxical delay\narises when the external excitation modifies the internal dynamics of the\nnetwork by causing additional spikes of inhibitory neurons, whose delaying\nwithin-network inhibition outweighs the immediate advance caused by the\nexternal excitation. These results explain how intrinsic heterogeneity allows\nthe PING rhythm to become synchronized with a periodic forcing or another PING\nrhythm for a wider range in the mismatch of their frequencies. We demonstrate a\nsimilar mechanism for the synchronization of ING rhythms. Our results identify\na potential function of neuronal heterogeneity in the synchronization of\ncoupled $\\gamma$-rhythms, which may play a role in neural information transfer\nvia communication through coherence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Dec 2020 01:58:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-15"}

Existing methods mainly focus on\ngenerating an embedding model utilized with a fixed metric (eg, cosine\ndistance) for nearest neighbour classification or directly generating a linear\nclassier. However, due to the limited discriminative capacity of such a simple\nmetric or classifier, these methods fail to generalize to challenging cases\nappropriately. To mitigate this problem, we present a novel deep metric\nmeta-generation method that turns to an orthogonal direction, ie, learning to\nadaptively generate a specific metric for a new FSL task based on the task\ndescription (eg, a few labelled samples). In this study, we structure the\nmetric using a three-layer deep attentive network that is flexible enough to\nproduce a discriminative metric for each task. Moreover, different from\nexisting methods that utilize an uni-modal weight distribution conditioned on\nlabelled samples for network generation, the proposed meta-learner establishes\na multi-modal weight distribution conditioned on cross-class sample pairs using\na tailored variational autoencoder, which can separately capture the specific\ninter-class discrepancy statistics for each class and jointly embed the\nstatistics for all classes into metric generation. By doing this, the generated\nmetric can be appropriately adapted to a new FSL task with pleasing\ngeneralization performance.

And the\nlocalized flat band might be closely related to an electron-phonon coupling.\nUltrafast optical spectroscopy identified multiple distinct time scales in the\n10-300 K range. Quantitative analysis of the fastest decay process evidenced a\nsignificant lifetime temperature dependence at high temperatures, while this\nstarts to change slowly below ~ 100 K where an anomalous Hall coefficient\noccurred. At low temperature, a coherent A1g phonon mode with a frequency of ~\n4.36 THz was extracted. Frequency temperature dependence suggests that phonon\nhardening occurs as temperature falls and anharmonic effects can explain it.\nFrequency fluence dependence indicates that the phonons soften as fluence\nincreases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Dec 2020 02:19:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 6 Mar 2021 03:37:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-09"}

This paper aims to tackle these issues and proposes a dual-branch\nnetwork with dual-sampling modulated Dice loss. It consists of two branches:\nlarge hard exudate biased learning branch and small hard exudate biased\nlearning branch. Both of them are responsible for their own duty separately.\nFurthermore, we propose a dual-sampling modulated Dice loss for the training\nsuch that our proposed dual-branch network is able to segment hard exudates in\ndifferent sizes. In detail, for the first branch, we use a uniform sampler to\nsample pixels from predicted segmentation mask for Dice loss calculation, which\nleads to this branch naturally be biased in favour of large hard exudates as\nDice loss generates larger cost on misidentification of large hard exudates\nthan small hard exudates. For the second branch, we use a re-balanced sampler\nto oversample hard exudate pixels and undersample background pixels for loss\ncalculation. In this way, cost on misidentification of small hard exudates is\nenlarged, which enforces the parameters in the second branch fit small hard\nexudates well. Considering that large hard exudates are much easier to be\ncorrectly identified than small hard exudates, we propose an easy-to-difficult\nlearning strategy by adaptively modulating the losses of two branches. We\nevaluate our proposed method on two public datasets and results demonstrate\nthat ours achieves state-of-the-art performances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Dec 2020 02:37:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 May 2021 06:59:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-07"}

Towards the goal of revealing the\nunderlying reason why neural networks are capable of solving some high\ndimensional problems, we develop an algebraic framework and an approximation\ntheory for compositional functions and their neural network approximations. The\ntheoretical foundation is developed in a way so that it supports the error\nanalysis for not only functions as input-output relations, but also numerical\nalgorithms. This capability is critical because it enables the analysis of\napproximation errors for problems for which analytic solutions are not\navailable, such as differential equations and optimal control. We identify a\nset of key features of compositional functions and the relationship between the\nfeatures and the complexity of neural networks. In addition to function\napproximations, we prove several formulae of error upper bounds for neural\nnetworks that approximate the solutions to differential equations,\noptimization, and optimal control.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Dec 2020 04:40:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-04"}

We first formally prove that adaptive codebooks can\nprovide stronger robustness guarantees than fixed codebooks as a preprocessing\ndefense on some datasets. Based on that insight, we propose a content-adaptive\npixel discretization defense called Essential Features, which discretizes the\nimage to a per-image adaptive codebook to reduce the color space. We then find\nthat Essential Features can be further optimized by applying adaptive blurring\nbefore the discretization to push perturbed pixel values back to their original\nvalue before determining the codebook. Against adaptive attacks, we show that\ncontent-adaptive pixel discretization extends the range of datasets that\nbenefit in terms of both L_2 and L_infinity robustness where previously fixed\ncodebooks were found to have failed.

In federated\nlearning, since local data are collected by clients, it is hardly guaranteed\nthat the data are correctly annotated. Although a lot of studies have been\nconducted to train the networks robust to these noisy data in a centralized\nsetting, these algorithms still suffer from noisy labels in federated learning.\nCompared to the centralized setting, clients' data can have different noise\ndistributions due to variations in their labeling systems or background\nknowledge of users. As a result, local models form inconsistent decision\nboundaries and their weights severely diverge from each other, which are\nserious problems in federated learning. To solve these problems, we introduce a\nnovel federated learning scheme that the server cooperates with local models to\nmaintain consistent decision boundaries by interchanging class-wise centroids.\nThese centroids are central features of local data on each device, which are\naligned by the server every communication round. Updating local models with the\naligned centroids helps to form consistent decision boundaries among local\nmodels, although the noise distributions in clients' data are different from\neach other.

Millions of rays, each requiring\nhundreds of forward passes through a neural network are needed to approximate\nthose integrations with Monte Carlo sampling. Here, we propose automatic\nintegration, a new framework for learning efficient, closed-form solutions to\nintegrals using coordinate-based neural networks. For training, we instantiate\nthe computational graph corresponding to the derivative of the network. The\ngraph is fitted to the signal to integrate. After optimization, we reassemble\nthe graph to obtain a network that represents the antiderivative. By the\nfundamental theorem of calculus, this enables the calculation of any definite\nintegral in two evaluations of the network.

Fractional coloring is the linear relaxation of the classical notion\nof coloring, and has many applications, in particular in scheduling.

In this work, we managed to derive explicit\nphotogain equations for silicon nanowire photoconductors based on experimental\nobservations. The silicon nanowires were fabricated by patterning the device\nlayer of silicon-on-insulator wafers by standard lithography that were doped\nwith boron. It was found that the as-fabricated silicon nanowires have a\nsurface depletion region ~ 32 nm wide. This depletion region protects charge\ncarriers in the channel from surface scatterings, resulting in the independence\nof charge carrier mobilities on nanowire size. It is consistent with our Hall\neffect measurements but in contradiction with the accepted conclusion in the\npast decades that charge carrier mobilities become smaller for smaller\nnanowires due to surface scatterings. Under light illumination, the depletion\nregion logarithmically narrows down and the nanowire channel widens\naccordingly. Photo Hall effect measurements show that the nanowire\nphotoconductance is not contributed by the increase of carrier concentrations\nbut the widening of the nanowire channel. As a result, a nanowire\nphotoconductor can be modeled as a resistor in connection with floating\nSchottky junctions near the nanowire surfaces.

Under the condition, that the wall is only partially\nwet (or dry) while the stripe tends to be wet completely, a liquid drop is\nformed above the stripe. The maximum height $\\ell_m(\\delta\\mu)$ of the drop\ndepends on the stripe width $L$ and the chemical potential departure from\nsaturation $\\delta\\mu$ where it adopts the value $\\ell_0=\\ell_m(0)$. Assuming a\nlong-range potential of van der Waals type exerted by the stripe, the\ninterfacial Hamiltonian model is used to show that $\\ell_0$ is approached\nlinearly with $\\delta\\mu$ with a slope which scales as $L^2$ over the region\nsatisfying $L\\lesssim \\xi_\\parallel$, where $\\xi_\\parallel$ is the parallel\ncorrelation function pertinent to the stripe.

Recently the\nimage-to-image translation has experienced significant levels of interest\nwithin medical research, beginning with the successful use of the Generative\nAdversarial Network (GAN) to the introduction of cyclic constraint extended to\nmultiple domains. However, in current approaches, there is no guarantee that\nthe mapping between the two image domains would be unique or one-to-one. In\nthis paper, we introduce a novel approach to unpaired image-to-image\ntranslation based on the invertible architecture. The invertible property of\nthe flow-based architecture assures a cycle-consistency of image-to-image\ntranslation without additional loss functions. We utilize the temporal\ninformation between consecutive slices to provide more constraints to the\noptimization for transforming one domain to another in unpaired volumetric\nmedical images.

However, fully-automatic approaches usually enhance the image in\na black-box manner that does not give the user any control over the\noptimization process, possibly leading to edited images that do not\nsubjectively appeal to the user. Semi-automatic methods mostly allow for\ncontrolling which pre-defined editing step is taken, which restricts the users\nin their creativity and ability to make detailed adjustments, such as\nbrightness or contrast. We argue that incorporating user preferences by guiding\nan automated enhancement method simplifies image editing and increases the\nenhancement's focus on the user.

NICER iteratively adjusts image\nediting parameters in order to maximize an aesthetic score based on image style\nand content.

In this paper, we propose a generalization of the Heckman\nsample selection model by allowing the sample selection bias and dispersion\nparameters to depend on covariates. We show that the non-robustness of the\nHeckman model may be due to the assumption of the constant sample selection\nbias parameter rather than the normality assumption. Our proposed methodology\nallows us to understand which covariates are important to explain the sample\nselection bias phenomenon rather than to only form conclusions about its\npresence.

Proper score\nresiduals for sample selection models are provided, and model adequacy is\naddressed. Simulated results are presented to check the finite-sample behavior\nof the estimators and to verify the consequences of not considering varying\nsample selection bias and dispersion parameters.

In mission-critical\napplications such as translating official documents, incorrect translation can\nhave unpleasant or sometimes catastrophic consequences. This motivates recent\nresearch on testing methodologies for machine translation systems. Existing\nmethodologies mostly rely on metamorphic relations designed at the textual\nlevel (e.g., Levenshtein distance) or syntactic level (e.g., the distance\nbetween grammar structures) to determine the correctness of translation\nresults. However, these metamorphic relations do not consider whether the\noriginal and translated sentences have the same meaning (i.e., Semantic\nsimilarity). Therefore, in this paper, we propose SemMT, an automatic testing\napproach for machine translation systems based on semantic similarity checking.\nSemMT applies round-trip translation and measures the semantic similarity\nbetween the original and translated sentences. Our insight is that the\nsemantics expressed by the logic and numeric constraint in sentences can be\ncaptured using regular expressions (or deterministic finite automata) where\nefficient equivalence/similarity checking algorithms are available. Leveraging\nthe insight, we propose three semantic similarity metrics and implement them in\nSemMT.

The near-resonant optical shaking\nconsidered here dynamically couples the low-lying $s$ band and the first\nexcited $p$ bands by transferring a photon of shaking frequency. The\nintertwined space-time symmetries are further uncovered to elucidate the\ndegeneracy in the spectrum solved with the generalized Bloch-Floquet theorem.\nSetting the chirality of circular shaking explicitly breaks time reversal\nsymmetry and lifts the degeneracy of $p_\\pm = p_x \\pm ip_y$ orbitals, leading\nto the local circulation of orbital magnetism, i.e the imbalanced occupation in\n$p_\\pm$ orbitals. Moreover, the dynamics of Berry connection is revealed by the\ntime evolution of the Berry curvature and the polarization, which have physical\nobservable effects in experiments. Interestingly, the dynamics is found\ncharacterized by a universal phase shift, governed by the time screw rotational\nsymmetry involving a fractional translation of time.

One typical example arises\nin vector-field guided path-following (VF-PF) navigation algorithms. These\nalgorithms are based on a vector field, and the singular points are exactly\nwhere the vector field diminishes. In this paper, we show that it is\nmathematically impossible for conventional VF-PF algorithms to achieve global\nconvergence to desired paths that are self-intersected or even just simple\nclosed (precisely, homeomorphic to the unit circle). Motivated by this new\nimpossibility result, we propose a novel method to transform self-intersected\nor simple closed desired paths to non-self-intersected and unbounded\n(precisely, homeomorphic to the real line) counterparts in a higher-dimensional\nspace. Corresponding to this new desired path, we construct a singularity-free\nguiding vector field on a higher-dimensional space. The integral curves of this\nnew guiding vector field is thus exploited to enable global convergence to the\nhigher-dimensional desired path, and therefore the projection of the integral\ncurves on a lower-dimensional subspace converge to the physical\n(lower-dimensional) desired path. Rigorous theoretical analysis is carried out\nfor the theoretical results using dynamical systems theory. In addition, we\nshow both by theoretical analysis and numerical simulations that our proposed\nmethod is an extension combining conventional VF-PF algorithms and trajectory\ntracking algorithms.

We first develop an equivalent\nEinstein-frame formalism to the current Jordan-frame formulation of the\nmechanism and use this to highlight similarities and differences of self-tuning\nto the sequestering mechanism. We then show how with an extension of the local\nself-tuning action by a coupled Gauss-Bonnet term and a companion four-form\nfield strength, graviton loops can be prevented from incapacitating the\ndegravitation of the Standard Model vacuum energy. For certain cases, we\nfurthermore find that this extension can be recast as a Horndeski scalar-tensor\ntheory and be embedded in the conventional local self-tuning formalism. We then\nexplore the possibility of a unification of inflation with self-tuning. The\nresulting equations can alternatively be used to motivate a multiverse\ninterpretation. In this context, we revisit the coincidence problem and provide\nan estimation for the probability of the emergence of intelligent life in our\nUniverse as a function of cosmic age, inferred from star and terrestrial planet\nformation processes.

In the last few years, they have\nfound application in the modelling of various computational structures, in\nfields as diverse as Computer Science, Physics, Control Theory, Linguistics,\nand Biology.\n  In many such proposals, the transformations of the described systems are\nmodelled as rewrite rules of diagrams. These developments demand a mathematical\nfoundation for string diagram rewriting: whereas rewrite theory for terms is\nwell-understood, the two-dimensional nature of string diagrams poses additional\nchallenges.\n  This work systematises and expands a series of recent conference papers\nlaying down such foundation. As first step, we focus on the case of rewrite\nsystems for string diagrammatic theories which feature a Frobenius algebra.\nThis situation ubiquitously appear in various approaches: for instance, in the\nalgebraic semantics of linear dynamical systems, Frobenius structures model the\nwiring of circuits; in categorical quantum mechanics, they model interacting\nquantum observables.\n  Our work introduces a combinatorial interpretation of string diagram\nrewriting modulo Frobenius structures, in terms of double-pushout hypergraph\nrewriting. Furthermore, we prove this interpretation to be sound and complete.\nIn the last part, we also see that the approach can be generalised to model\nrewriting modulo multiple Frobenius structures.

In this\nstudy, we propose a reactive and adaptive method for robotic pushing that uses\nrich feedback from a high-resolution optical tactile sensor to control push\nmovements instead of relying on analytical or data-driven models of push\ninteractions. Specifically, we use goal-driven tactile exploration to actively\nsearch for stable pushing configurations that cause the object to maintain its\npose relative to the pusher while incrementally moving the pusher and object\ntowards the target. We evaluate our method by pushing objects across planar and\ncurved surfaces. For planar surfaces, we show that the method is accurate and\nrobust to variations in initial contact position/angle, object shape and start\nposition; for curved surfaces, the performance is degraded slightly. An\nimmediate consequence of our work is that it shows that explicit models of push\ninteractions might be sufficient but are not necessary for this type of task.\nIt also raises the interesting question of which aspects of the system should\nbe modelled to achieve the best performance and generalization across a wide\nrange of scenarios. Finally, it highlights the importance of testing on\nnon-planar surfaces and in other more complex environments when developing new\nmethods for robotic pushing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Dec 2020 12:03:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Apr 2021 18:39:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 2 Aug 2021 06:52:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-03"}

Correlated time variations are often\nmitigated by Gaussian processes (GP). They rely on fitting kernel functions\nthat are motivated on mathematical grounds, and whose physical interpretation\nis often elusive. We aim to establish a connection between stellar activity\naffecting RVs and their correlations with physical parameters, and compare this\nconnection with kernels used in the literature. We use simple activity models\nto investigate the relationship between the physical processes generating the\nsignals and the covariances typically found in data, and to demonstrate the\nqualitative behaviour of this relationship. We use the StarSim code to\ncalculate RVs of an M dwarf with different realistic evolving spot\nconfigurations. Their auto-correlation functions (ACF) show a very specific\nbehaviour and are related to the kernel. GP regression is performed using a\nquasi-periodic (QP) and harmonic oscillator kernels. Comparison of the\nresulting kernels with the exact ACFs allows us to cross-match the kernel\nhyper-parameters with the introduced physical values, study the overall\ncapabilities of the kernels, and improve their definition. We find that the QP\nkernel provides a more straightforward interpretation of the physics. It is\nable to consistently recover both the introduced rotation period P and the spot\nlifetime. Our study indicates that the performance can be enhanced by fixing\nthe form factor w and adding a physically motivated cosine term with period\nP/2, where the contribution to the ACF for the different spot configurations\ndiffers significantly. The new quasi-periodic with cosine kernel leads to\nsignificantly better model likelihoods, can potentially distinguish between\ndifferent spot configurations, and can thereby improve the sensitivity of RV\nexoplanet searches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Dec 2020 12:04:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-13"}

In the semi-supervised setting, the first\nmask of each object is provided at test time. Following the one-shot principle,\nfine-tuning VOS methods train a segmentation model separately on each given\nobject mask. However, recently the VOS community has deemed such a test time\noptimization and its impact on the test runtime as unfeasible. To mitigate the\ninefficiencies of previous fine-tuning approaches, we present efficient\nOne-Shot Video Object Segmentation (e-OSVOS). In contrast to most VOS\napproaches, e-OSVOS decouples the object detection task and predicts only local\nsegmentation masks by applying a modified version of Mask R-CNN. The one-shot\ntest runtime and performance are optimized without a laborious and handcrafted\nhyperparameter search. To this end, we meta learn the model initialization and\nlearning rates for the test time optimization. To achieve optimal learning\nbehavior, we predict individual learning rates at a neuron level. Furthermore,\nwe apply an online adaptation to address the common performance degradation\nthroughout a sequence by continuously fine-tuning the model on previous mask\npredictions supported by a frame-to-frame bounding box propagation. e-OSVOS\nprovides state-of-the-art results on DAVIS 2016, DAVIS 2017, and YouTube-VOS\nfor one-shot fine-tuning methods while reducing the test runtime substantially.\n  Code is available at https://github.com/dvl-tum/e-osvos.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Dec 2020 12:21:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-04"}

To accomplish this\nwork we have analysed two scenarios: the SIS-model (Susceptible => Infectious\n=> Susceptible) in presence of the lockdown measures and the SIS-model\nintegrated with the action of the hospitals (always in presence of the lockdown\nmeasures). We show that in the case of the pure SIS-model, once the lockdown\nmeasures are removed, the Coronavirus will start growing again.

Extending this idea with a generative\nadversarial network, we show how entire textures are replaced by ones that are\nless costly to encode but preserve sense of detail.\n  Our approach can remodel a conventional codec to adjust for the MS-SSIM\ndistortion with over 20% rate improvement without any decoding overhead. On\ntask-aware image compression, we perform favourably against a similar but\ncodec-specific approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Dec 2020 12:34:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 7 Mar 2021 03:44:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-09"}

After the\nsampling process, a decision must be made about whether $P$ holds some\nproperty, or is far from it. The most studied problem in the field is arguably\nuniformity testing, where one needs to distinguish the case that $P$ is uniform\nover $[n]$ from the case that $P$ is $\\epsilon$-far from being uniform (in\n$\\ell_1$). In the classic model, it is known that\n$\\Theta\\left(\\sqrt{n}/\\epsilon^2\\right)$ samples are necessary and sufficient\nfor this task. This problem was recently considered in various restricted\nmodels that pose, for example, communication or memory constraints. In more\nthan one occasion, the known optimal solution boils down to counting collisions\namong the drawn samples (each two samples that have the same value add one to\nthe count), an idea that dates back to the first uniformity tester, and was\ncoined the name \"collision-based tester\".\n  In this paper, we introduce the notion of comparison graphs and use it to\nformally define a generalized collision-based tester. Roughly speaking, the\nedges of the graph indicate the tester which pairs of samples should be\ncompared (that is, the original tester is induced by a clique, where all pairs\nare being compared). We prove a structural theorem that gives a sufficient\ncondition for a comparison graph to induce a good uniformity tester. As an\napplication, we develop a generic method to test uniformity, and devise\nnearly-optimal uniformity testers under various computational constraints. We\nimprove and simplify a few known results, and introduce a new constrained model\nin which the method also produces an efficient tester.\n  The idea behind our method is to translate computational constraints of a\ncertain model to ones on the comparison graph, which paves the way to finding a\ngood graph.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Dec 2020 12:57:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-04"}

If the\nBondi energy is Hamiltonian, it can thus only be a time dependent Hamiltonian.\nIn this paper, we show that the Bondi energy can be understood as a\ntime-dependent Hamiltonian on the covariant phase space. Our derivation starts\nfrom the Hamiltonian formulation in domains with boundaries that are null. We\nintroduce the most general boundary conditions on a generic such null boundary,\nand compute quasi-local charges for boosts, energy and angular momentum.\nInitially, these domains are at finite distance, such that there is a natural\nIR regulator. To remove the IR regulator, we introduce a double null foliation\ntogether with an adapted Newman--Penrose null tetrad. Both null directions are\nsurface orthogonal. We study the falloff conditions for such specific null\nfoliations and take the limit to null infinity. At null infinity, we recover\nthe Bondi mass and the usual covariant phase space for the two radiative modes\nat the full non-perturbative level.

First of all, it explains the physical\nsignificance of the corner term that is added in the Wald--Zoupas framework to\nrender the quasi-conserved charges integrable. The term to be added is simply\nthe derivative of the Hamiltonian with respect to the background fields that\ndrive the time-dependence of the Hamiltonian.

To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a\nsparse array of sub-surface (SAoS) architecture for RIS, which contains several\nrectangle shaped sub-surfaces termed as RIS tiles that can be sparsely\ndeployed. An approximated ergodic spectral efficiency of the SAoS aided system\nis derived and the performance impact of the SAoS design is evaluated. Based on\nthe approximated ergodic spectral efficiency, we obtain an optimal reflection\ncoefficient design for each RIS tile. Analytical results show that the received\nsignal-to-noise ratios can grow quadratically and linearly to the number of RIS\nelements under strong and weak LoS scenarios, respectively. Furthermore, we\nconsider the visible region (VR) phenomenon in the SAoS aided mmWave system and\nfind that the optimal distance between RIS tiles is supposed to yield a total\nSAoS VR nearly covering the whole blind coverage area. The numerical results\nverify the tightness of the approximated ergodic spectral efficiency and\ndemonstrate the great system performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Dec 2020 13:13:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-04"}

The SS priors, which belong\nto a class of discrete-mixture priors and are known for their strong\nsparsifying (or shrinkage) properties, are employed to induce sparse solutions\nand select relevant variables. Three different variants of SS priors are\nexplored for performing Bayesian equation discovery.

While the efficacy of DL\nsystems is indeed impressive, the way they approach the RPMs is very different\nfrom that of humans.

Furthermore, we propose a new sparse rule encoding scheme\nfor RPMs which, besides the new training algorithm, is the key factor\ncontributing to the state-of-the-art performance. The proposed approach is\nevaluated on two most popular benchmark datasets (Balanced-RAVEN and PGM) and\non both of them demonstrates an advantage over the current state-of-the-art\nresults. Contrary to applications of contrastive learning methods reported in\nother domains, the state-of-the-art performance reported in the paper is\nachieved with no need for large batch sizes or strong data augmentation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Dec 2020 14:18:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-16"}

However, many existing studies of\ninteractive graph search aim at identifying a single target optimally, and\nsuffer from the limitations of asking too many questions and not being able to\nhandle multiple targets. To address these two limitations, in this paper, we\nstudy a new problem of budget constrained interactive graph search for multiple\ntargets called kBM-IGS-problem. Specifically, given a set of multiple targets T\nin a hierarchy, and two parameters k and b, the goal is to identify a k-sized\nset of selections S such that the closeness between selections S and targets T\nis as small as possible, by asking at most a budget of b questions. We\ntheoretically analyze the updating rules and design a penalty function to\ncapture the closeness between selections and targets. To tackle the\nkBM-IGS-problem, we develop a novel framework to ask questions using the best\nvertex with the largest expected gain, which makes a balanced trade-off between\ntarget probability and benefit gain. Based on the kBM-IGS framework, we first\npropose an efficient algorithm STBIS to handle the SingleTarget problem, which\nis a special case of kBM-IGS. Then, we propose a dynamic programming based\nmethod kBM-DP to tackle the MultipleTargets problem. To further improve\nefficiency, we propose two heuristic but efficient algorithms kBM-Topk and\nkBM-DP+. kBM-Topk develops a variant gain function and selects the top-k\nvertices independently. kBM-DP+ uses an upper bound of gains and prunes\ndisqualified vertices to save computations. Experiments on large real-world\ndatasets with ground-truth targets verify both the effectiveness and efficiency\nof our proposed algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Dec 2020 14:20:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2020 03:22:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2020 07:05:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-18"}

We argue that these strategies are\ninsufficient since they can at most alleviate the negative effect caused by\nmissing annotations. In this paper, we propose a simple but effective\nmechanism, called Co-mining, for sparsely annotated object detection.

The applicability and potential of the developed\ntechnique is shown using a three dimensional test case and a more complex\nindustrial test case. The first example is used to highlight the numerical\nproperties of the scheme, whereas the second example demonstrates the potential\nin a more complex setting and it shows the possibility to integrate the\nproposed framework within a commercial FE package. In addition, the last\nexample shows the possibility to use the generalized solution in a\nmulti-objective optimization setting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Dec 2020 14:35:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-04"}

However, deterministic\nMPC only considers one single realization of the disturbances and its\nperformance strongly depends on the quality of the forecast of the\ndisturbances, which can lead to low performance. In fact, inadequate building\nenergy management can lead to high energy costs and CO$_2$ emissions. On the\nother hand, a linearized model can fail to capture some dynamics and behavior\nof the building under control. In this article, we combine a stochastic\nscenario-based MPC (SBMPC) controller together with a nonlinear Modelica model\nthat is able to provide a richer building description and to capture the\ndynamics of the building more accurately than linear models. The adopted SBMPC\ncontroller considers multiple realizations of the external disturbances\nobtained through a statistically accurate model, so as to consider different\npossible disturbance evolutions and to robustify the control action. To this\npurpose, we present a scenario generation method for building temperature\ncontrol that can be applied to several exogenous perturbations, e.g.\\ solar\nirradiance, outside temperature, and that satisfies several important\nstastistical properties, in contrast with simpler and less accurate methods\nadopted in the literature. We show the benefits of our proposed approach\nthrough several simulations in which we compare our method against the standard\nones from the literature, for several combinations of a trade-off parameter\nbetween comfort and energy cost. We show how our SBMPC controller approach\noutperforms the standard controllers available in the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Dec 2020 15:45:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 May 2021 10:13:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-01"}

These highly nonlinear dynamics which increase the order of\nthe system are extremely difficult to model with high degree of accuracy. A\ngeneral model for attitude and flexible dynamics for a class of spacecraft is\nhence derived in detail based on the so-called hybrid coordinates approach. The\nspacecraft considered has a star topology with a rigid central bus and flexible\nplate-type appendages. Given that the flexible spacecraft is under-actuated,\nthe input-output feedback linearization technique is specifically used to\npartition the system into two distinct parts, namely an external linear system\nand an internal unobservable nonlinear system. A general internal/zero dynamics\ntheorem for a class of nonlinear systems is proved and then applied to a\nflexible spacecraft which results in a linear asymptotically stable zero\ndynamics. The overall closed-loop stability of the flexible spacecraft is also\nanalyzed rigorously and shown to be locally asymptotically stable using the\nLyapunov theory. The robustness of the controller against modeling and\nparametric uncertainties is examined through extensive numerical simulations.\nOverall, the feedback linearization control scheme has been proven to be\nfeasible and efficient for the attitude recovery of a spacecraft and has also\nbecome front and center in other application areas in the recent years.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2020 20:20:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-07"}

While physically-based models are rooted in rich\nunderstanding of the physical processes, a significant performance gap still\nremains which can be potentially addressed by leveraging the recent advances in\nmachine learning. The goal of this work is to incorporate our understanding of\nphysical processes and constraints in hydrology into machine learning\nalgorithms, and thus bridge the performance gap while reducing the need for\nlarge amounts of data compared to traditional data-driven approaches. In\nparticular, we propose an LSTM based deep learning architecture that is coupled\nwith SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool), an hydrology model that is in wide\nuse today. The key idea of the approach is to model auxiliary intermediate\nprocesses that connect weather drivers to streamflow, rather than directly\nmapping runoff from weather variables which is what a deep learning\narchitecture without physical insight will do. The efficacy of the approach is\nbeing analyzed on several small catchments located in the South Branch of the\nRoot River Watershed in southeast Minnesota. Apart from observation data on\nrunoff, the approach also leverages a 200-year synthetic dataset generated by\nSWAT to improve the performance while reducing convergence time. In the early\nphases of this study, simpler versions of the physics guided deep learning\narchitectures are being used to achieve a system understanding of the coupling\nof physics and machine learning.

In strong electric fields, vesicles undergo significant deformation,\nwhich strongly alters the transmembrane potential, consequently the\nelectroporation. Previous theoretical studies investigated the\nelectrodeformation of vesicles in DC fields (which are not pulsed). In this\nwork, we computationally investigate the deformation of a deflated vesicle\nunder unipolar, bipolar, and two-step unipolar pulses and show sensitive\ndependence of intermediate shapes on type of pulse and the pulse width.\nStarting with the stress-free initial shape of a deflated vesicle, which is\nsimilar to a prolate spheroid, the analysis is presented for the cases with\nhigher and lower conductivities of the inner fluid medium relative to the outer\nfluid medium. For the ratio of inner to outer fluid conductivity,\n$\\sigma_\\mathrm{r}$ = 10, the shape always remains prolate, including when the\nfield is turned off. For $\\sigma_\\mathrm{r} = 0.1$, several complex dynamics\nare observed, such as the prolate-to-oblate (PO), prolate-to-oblate-to-prolate\n(POP) shape transitions in time depending upon the strength of the field and\nthe pulse properties. In this case, on turning off the field, a metastable\noblate equilibrium shape is seen, that seems to be a characteristics of a\ndeflated vesicle leading to POPO transitions. When a two-step unipolar pulse (a\ncombination of a strong and a weak subpulse) is applied, a vesicle can reach an\noblate or a prolate final shape depending upon the relative durations of the\ntwo subpulses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Dec 2020 14:52:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Jul 2021 07:17:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-09"}

Due to large volume and scale, in FTL, delivery time is often less\ncritical but cost and service quality are crucial. Therefore, efficiently\nsolving large scale multiple shift FTL problems is becoming more and more\nimportant and requires further research. In one of our earlier studies, a set\ncovering model and a three-stage solution method were developed for a\nmulti-shift FTL problem. This paper extends the previous work and presents a\nsignificantly more efficient approach by hybridising pricing and cutting\nstrategies with metaheuristics (a variable neighbourhood search and a genetic\nalgorithm). The metaheuristics were adopted to find promising columns (vehicle\nroutes) guided by pricing and cuts are dynamically generated to eliminate\ninfeasible flow assignments caused by incompatible commodities. Computational\nexperiments on real-life and artificial benchmark FTL problems showed superior\nperformance both in terms of computational time and solution quality, when\ncompared with previous MIP based three-stage methods and two existing\nmetaheuristics.

His analysis points both to ongoing difficulties in attracting women\nto high-energy physics and an encouraging-though slow-trend in improvement.\nUnfortunately, however, the time and effort Strumia (2020) devoted to collating\nand quantifying the data are not matched by a similar rigour in interpreting\nthe results. To support his conclusions, he selectively cites available\nliterature and fails to adequately adjust for a range of confounding factors.\nFor example, his analyses do not consider how unobserved factors -- e.g., a\ntendency to overcite well-known authors -- drive a wedge between quality and\ncitations and correlate with author gender. He also fails to take into account\nmany structural and non-structural factors -- including, but not limited to,\ndirect discrimination and the expectations women form (and actions they take)\nin response to it -- that undoubtedly lead to gender differences in\nproductivity. We therefore believe that a number of Strumia's conclusions are\nnot supported by his analysis.
