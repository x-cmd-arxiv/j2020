In addition, we present two\nimprovements to the method: 1) the population generation now relies on a\nclustering of all low-energy structures evaluated with DFT, with the lowest\nenergy member of each cluster making up the population. 2) the very final\nrelaxations in well-sampled basins of the energy landscape, the final\nexploitation steps, are now performed as continued relaxation paths within the\nfirst-principles method, to allow for arbitrarily fine relaxations of the best\nstructures, independently of the predictive resolution of the surrogate model.\nThe versatility of the GOFEE method is demonstrated by applying it to identify\nthe low-energy structures of gas-phase fullerene-type 24-atom carbon clusters\nand of dome-shaped 18-atom carbon clusters supported on Ir(111).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Dec 2020 16:29:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-01"}

There are many\nnumerical modelling frameworks capable of simulating such systems on growing\ndomains, however each of these may be well suited to different spatial scales\nand particle numbers.

Paper I gave a general formulation of Airy isostasy as an elastic\nloading problem solved with Love numbers, and applied it to the case of minimum\nstress isostasy. In this sequel, the same framework is used to study Airy\nisostasy as the long-time evolution of a viscoelastic shell submitted to\nsurface and internal loads. Isostatic ratios are defined in terms of\ntime-dependent deviatoric Love numbers. Dynamic isostasy depends on the loading\nhistory, two examples of which are the constant load applied on the surface in\nthe far past and the constant shape maintained by addition or removal of\nmaterial at the compensation depth. The former model results in a shape\ndecreasing exponentially with time and has no elastic analog, whereas the\nlatter (stationary) model is equivalent to a form of elastic isostasy.\nViscoelastic and viscous approaches are completely equivalent. If both load and\nshape vary slowly with time, isostatic ratios look like those of the stationary\nmodel. Isostatic models thus belong to two independent groups: the\nelastic/stationary approaches and the time-dependent approaches. If the shell\nis homogeneous, all models predict a similar compensation of large-scale\ngravity perturbations. If the shell rheology depends on depth, stationary\nmodels predict more compensation at long wavelengths, whereas time-dependent\nmodels result in negligible compensation.

In this work,\nwe demonstrate the generation of phonon-polaritons in the quantum motion of an\noptically-levitated nanosphere. The particle is trapped in high vacuum by an\noptical tweezer and strongly coupled to a single cavity mode by coherent\nscattering of the tweezer photons.

As such, when\nentering the strong coupling regime, we observe hybrid light-mechanical states\nwith a dispersion law typical of tripartite quantum systems.

The objective of this\nwork is to introduce the novel graph matching techniques using the\nrepresentational power of the graph and apply it to structural pattern\nrecognition applications. We present an extensive survey of various exact and\ninexact graph matching techniques. Graph matching using the concept of\nhomeomorphism is presented. A category of graph matching algorithms is\npresented, which reduces the graph size by removing the less important nodes\nusing some measure of relevance. We present an approach to error-tolerant graph\nmatching using node contraction where the given graph is transformed into\nanother graph by contracting smaller degree nodes. We use this scheme to extend\nthe notion of graph edit distance, which can be used as a trade-off between\nexecution time and accuracy. We describe an approach to graph matching by\nutilizing the various node centrality information, which reduces the graph size\nby removing a fraction of nodes from both graphs based on a given centrality\nmeasure. The graph matching problem is inherently linked to the geometry and\ntopology of graphs. We introduce a novel approach to measure graph similarity\nusing geometric graphs. We define the vertex distance between two geometric\ngraphs using the position of their vertices and show it to be a metric over the\nset of all graphs with vertices only. We define edge distance between two\ngraphs based on the angular orientation, length and position of the edges. Then\nwe combine the notion of vertex distance and edge distance to define the graph\ndistance between two geometric graphs and show it to be a metric.

This is particularly the case\nsince vectorlike $Y$ quark, which is estimated to be produced with a high\ncross-section, can only decay via a $W$ boson and a down type quark ($d,s,b$).\nWe calculate the cross sections of signal (for different couplings and mass\nvalues) and relevant Standard Model (SM) backgrounds.

In the case of two views, the dependence\nbetween them is captured by a cluster membership matrix parameter and we aim to\nlearn the structure of this matrix (e.g. the zero pattern). First, we develop a\npenalized likelihood approach to estimate the sparsity pattern of the cluster\nmembership matrix. For the specific case of block diagonal structures, we\ndevelop a constrained likelihood formulation where this matrix is constrained\nto be block diagonal up to permutations of the rows and columns.

The NPM resonator made of periodic nanostrip array is\nfabricated on a lithium niobate substrate. Each of the nanostrip is 250-nm wide\nand is made of 680-nm-thick SiO2 layer stacking on 50-nm Al metal electrodes.\nFinite element analysis reveals that the device operates in a vertically\npolarized (compression) mode with substantial acoustic energy confined in the\nnanostrips, leading to a local resonance at low acoustic velocity. Due to the\nnonlinearity, the resonance frequency of the device decreases quadratically\nwith the increase of stimulation power from 10 to 30 dBm. The underlying\nmechanism of the nonlinearity is found to be the power-dependent coupling of\nthe adjacent nanostrips. This coupling induces softening of the substrate\nsurface region, which reduces the acoustic velocity and hence the bulk\nradiation. As a result, the quality factor of the NPM resonator is found to\nimprove with the increase of stimulation power. The power-dependent coupling of\nnanostrips in the NPM resonator demonstrates a reliable method for the\nrealization of nonlinearity in phononic metasurfaces, which would significantly\nenrich the mechanisms for the manipulation of surface acoustic waves at high\nfrequencies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Dec 2020 20:37:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-31"}

Perhaps the most pertinent prediction task that can\nresult in billions of dollars in losses each year is the assessment of credit\nrisk (i.e., the risk of default on debt). Today, much of the gains from machine\nlearning to predict credit risk are driven by gradient boosted decision tree\nmodels. However, these gains begin to plateau without the addition of expensive\nnew data sources or highly engineered features. In this paper, we present our\nattempts to create a novel approach to assessing credit risk using deep\nlearning that does not rely on new model inputs. We propose a new credit card\ntransaction sampling technique to use with deep recurrent and causal\nconvolution-based neural networks that exploits long historical sequences of\nfinancial data without costly resource requirements. We show that our\nsequential deep learning approach using a temporal convolutional network\noutperformed the benchmark non-sequential tree-based model, achieving\nsignificant financial savings and earlier detection of credit risk.

The dynamical source of these complications has been identified\nwith the tadpole/seagull term, which renormalized version called, the mass gap.\nIts true dynamical role is hidden in the QCD ground state, but it is explicitly\npresent in the full gluon self-energy. To disclose it the splintering between\nthe transverse conditions for the full gluon self-energy and its subtracted\ncounterpart has been derived. The equation of motion for the full gluon\npropagator on account of the mass gap was given, which allows to fix the\ndynamical and gauge structures by a newly-introduced generalized gauge. A novel\nnon-perturbative analytical method, the mass gap approach was developed for QCD\nand its groud state as well.

It accommodates all the severe infrared singularities, which may\nappear in the QCD ground state due to the self-interaction of massless gluon\nmodes.

However, as single entities, these\nembeddings are difficult to interpret and the models used to create them have\nbeen described as opaque. Binder and colleagues proposed an intuitive embedding\nspace where each dimension is based on one of 65 core semantic features.\nUnfortunately, the space only exists for a small dataset of 535 words, limiting\nits uses.

CO (2-1), which probes outflowing gas, is detected in all the\nsources (for the first time in SerpS-MM22 and SerpS-MM18b). Collimated\nhigh-velocity jets in SiO (5-4) are detected in 67% of the sources (for the\nfirst time in IRAS4B2, IRAS4B1, L1448-NB, SerpS-MM18a), and 77% of these also\nshow jet/outflow emission in SO ($5_6-4_5$). In 5 sources (24% of the sample)\nSO ($5_6-4_5$) probes the inner envelope and/or the disk. The CALYPSO survey\nshows that the outflow phenomenon is ubiquitous and that the detection rate of\nhigh-velocity jets increases with protostellar accretion, with at least 80% of\nthe sources with Lint>1 Lsun driving a jet. The protostellar flows exhibit an\nonion-like structure, where the SiO jet (opening angle ~10$^o$) is nested into\na wider angle SO (~15$^o$) and CO (~25$^o$) outflow. On scales >300 au the SiO\njets are less collimated than atomic jets from Class II sources (~3$^o$).\nVelocity asymmetry between the two jet lobes are detected in one third of the\nsources, similarly to Class II atomic jets, suggesting that the same launching\nmechanism is at work. Most of the jets are SiO rich (SiO/H2 from >2.4e-7 to\n>5e-6), which indicates efficient release of >1%-10% of silicon in gas phase\nlikely in dust-free winds, launched from inside the dust sublimation radius.\nThe mass-loss rates (from ~7e-8 to ~3e-6 Msun/yr) are larger than what was\nmeasured for Class II jets. Similarly to Class II sources, the mass-loss rates\nare ~1%-50% of the mass accretion rates suggesting that the correlation between\nejection and accretion in young stars holds from 1e4 yr up to a few Myr.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Dec 2020 00:30:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Jan 2021 16:23:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-14"}

A fundamental problem is whether and how recovery\nguided by government policies is able to meet the challenge of a wide range of\ndisruptions. Prior research on this problem is scant due to lack of sharing\nlarge-scale granular data at the operational energy grid, stigma of revealing\nlimitations of services, and complex recovery coupled with policies and\ncustomers. As such, both quantification and firsthand information are lacking\non capabilities and fundamental limitation of energy services in response to\nextreme events. Furthermore, government policies that guide recovery are often\nsidelined by prior study. This work studies the fundamental problem through the\nlens of recovery guided by two commonly adopted policies. We develop data\nanalysis on unsupervised learning from non-stationary data. The data span\nfailure events, from moderate to extreme, at the operational distribution grid\nduring the past nine years in two service regions at the state of New York and\nMassachusetts. We show that under the prioritization policy favoring large\nfailures, recovery exhibits a surprising scaling property which counteracts\nfailure scaling on the infrastructure vulnerability.

Secondly, we propose a feature loss that combines different levels of\nimage features to guide the network to perform higher-quality deblurring and\nimprove the feature similarity between the restored images and the sharp image.\nFinally, we propose to use the lightweight RFB-s module to improve the\nreal-time performance of deblurring network. Compared with the existing\ndeblurring methods on large-scale real sea image datasets and large-scale\ndeblurring datasets, the proposed method not only has better deblurring\nperformance in visual perception and quantitative criteria, but also has higher\ndeblurring efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Dec 2020 03:57:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-01"}

The unsteady dynamics of these vortices are examined\nwith a spatio-temporally resolved Large-Eddy Simulation dataset on a\nrepresentative configuration consisting of a cylinder with an upswept basal\nsurface. Emphasis is placed on understanding the meandering motion of the\nvortices in the pair, including vortex core displacement, spectral content,\nstability mechanisms and overall rank-behavior. The first two energy-ranked\nmodes obtained through Proper Orthogonal Decomposition(POD) of the\ntime-resolved vorticity field reveals a pair of vortex dipoles aligned\nrelatively perpendicularly to each other. The dynamics is successfully mapped\nto a matched Batchelor vortex pair whose spatial and temporal stability\nanalyses indicate similar dipole structures associated with an |m|=1 elliptic\nmode pair. This short-wave elliptic instability dominates the meandering\nmotion, with strain due to axial velocity playing a key role in breakdown. The\nlow frequency of the unstable mode (Strouhal number StD =0.3 based on cylinder\ndiameter) is consistent with spectral analysis of meandering in the LES. The\nwake is examined for its rank behavior; the number of modes required to\nreproduce the flow to given degree of accuracy diminishes rapidly outside of\nthe immediate vicinity of the base. Beyond two diameters downstream, only two\nleading POD modes are required to reconstruct the dominant meandering motion\nand spatial structure in the LES data with < 15% performance loss, while ten\nmodes nearly completely recover the flow field. This low-rank behavior may hold\npromise in constructing a reduced-order model for control purposes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Dec 2020 04:32:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-01"}

There are two problems behind that have been long overlooked:\n1) the conventional setting of $T$ iterations with the step size of\n$\\epsilon/T$ to comply with the $\\epsilon$-constraint. In this case, most of\nthe pixels are allowed to add very small noise, much less than $\\epsilon$; and\n2) usually manipulating pixel-wise noise. However, features of a pixel\nextracted by DNNs are influenced by its surrounding regions, and different DNNs\ngenerally focus on different discriminative regions in recognition. To tackle\nthese issues, our previous work proposes a patch-wise iterative method (PIM)\naimed at crafting adversarial examples with high transferability. Specifically,\nwe introduce an amplification factor to the step size in each iteration, and\none pixel's overall gradient overflowing the $\\epsilon$-constraint is properly\nassigned to its surrounding regions by a project kernel. But targeted attacks\naim to push the adversarial examples into the territory of a specific class,\nand the amplification factor may lead to underfitting.

Manually annotating polyp region\nin a large scale video dataset is time-consuming and expensive, which limits\nthe development of deep learning techniques. A compromise is to train the\ntarget model by using labeled images and infer on colonoscopy videos. However,\nthere are several issues between the image-based training and video-based\ninference, including domain differences, lack of positive samples, and temporal\nsmoothness. To address these issues, we propose an Image-video-joint polyp\ndetection network (Ivy-Net) to address the domain gap between colonoscopy\nimages from historical medical reports and real-time videos. In our Ivy-Net, a\nmodified mixup is utilized to generate training data by combining the positive\nimages and negative video frames at the pixel level, which could learn the\ndomain adaptive representations and augment the positive samples.\nSimultaneously, a temporal coherence regularization (TCR) is proposed to\nintroduce the smooth constraint on feature-level in adjacent frames and improve\npolyp detection by unlabeled colonoscopy videos. For evaluation, a new large\ncolonoscopy polyp dataset is collected, which contains 3056 images from\nhistorical medical reports of 889 positive patients and 7.5-hour videos of 69\npatients (28 positive).

On top\nof that, high mobility adds an extra burden in vehicular edge networks (VENs),\nbolstering the desire for efficient user-centric solutions. Therefore, unlike\nthe legacy inflexible network-centric approach, this paper exploits a\nsoftware-defined flexible, open, and programmable networking platform for an\nefficient user-centric, fast, reliable, and deadline-constrained offloading\nsolution in VENs. In the proposed model, each active vehicle user (VU) is\nserved from multiple low-powered access points (APs) by creating a noble\nvirtual cell (VC). A joint node association, power allocation, and distributed\nresource allocation problem is formulated. As centralized learning is not\npractical in many real-world problems, following the distributed nature of\nautonomous VUs, each VU is considered an edge learning agent. To that end,\nconsidering practical location-aware node associations, a joint radio and power\nresource allocation non-cooperative stochastic game is formulated. Leveraging\nreinforcement learning's (RL) efficacy, a multi-agent RL (MARL) solution is\nproposed where the edge learners aim to learn the Nash equilibrium (NE)\nstrategies to solve the game efficiently.

This manifests as\nspin-splitting of the BCS density of states of the superconductor, an important\ningredient for numerous superconducting spintronics applications and the\nrealization of Majorana fermions. A crucial parameter that determines the\nmagnitude of the induced spin-splitting in FI/S bilayers is the thickness of\nthe S layer $d$: In very thin samples, the superconductivity is suppressed by\nthe strong magnetism. By contrast, in very thick samples, the spin splitting is\nabsent at distances away from the interface. In this work, we calculate the\ndensity of states and critical field of FI/S bilayers of arbitrary thickness.\nFrom here, we determine the range of parameters of interest for applications,\nwhere the exchange field and superconductivity coexist. We compare our theory\nwith the tunneling spectroscopy measurements in several EuS/Al/AlO$_x$/Al\nsamples. If the Al film in contact with the EuS is thinner than a certain\ncritical value, we do not observe superconductivity, whereas, in thicker\nsamples, we find evidence of a first-order phase transition induced by an\nexternal field. The complete transition is preceded by a regime in which normal\nand superconducting regions coexist.

We show that these distributions can be\naccounted for in the blade envelope using vector-valued models derived from\ndiscrete surface flow measurements. Our methods result in a set of variables\nthat allows flexible and independent control over multiple flow characteristics\nand performance metrics, similar in spirit to inverse design methods. The\naugmentations to the blade envelope workflow presented in this paper are\ndemonstrated on the LS89 turbine blade, focusing on the control of loss, mass\nflow and the isentropic Mach number distribution. Finally, we demonstrate how\nblade envelopes can be used to visualize invariant designs by producing a 3D\nrender of the envelope using 3D modelling software.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Dec 2020 12:27:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 31 Dec 2021 11:20:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-03"}

To cope with highly\nnon-IID data distributions, personalized federated learning (PFL) has been\nproposed to improve overall performance by allowing each client to learn a\npersonalized model.

In conventional thermodynamics conditional\non vanishingly weak system-bath coupling these two conditions are commonly\nregarded as equivalent. In this work we show that for thermodynamics at strong\ncoupling they are inequivalent: namely, two systems can be in equilibrium and\nyet have different effective temperatures. A recent result \\cite{NEqFE} for\nGaussian quantum systems shows that an effective temperature $T^{*}$ can be\ndefined at all times during a system's nonequilibrium evolution, but because of\nthe inclusion of interaction energy, after equilibration the system's $T^*$ is\nslightly higher than the bath temperature $T_{\\textsc{b}}$, with the deviation\ndepending on the coupling. A second object coupled with a different strength\nwith an identical bath at temperature $T_{\\textsc{b}}$ will not have the same\nequilibrated temperature as the first object. Thus $ET \\neq EQ $ for strong\ncoupling thermodynamics. We then investigate the conditions for dynamical\nequilibration for two objects 1 and 2 strongly coupled with a common bath $B$,\neach with a different equilibrated effective temperature. We show this is\npossible, and prove the existence of a generalized fluctuation-dissipation\nrelation under this configuration. This affirms that `in equilibrium' is a\nvalid and perhaps more fundamental notion which the zeroth law for quantum\nthermodynamics at strong coupling should be based on. Only when the system-bath\ncoupling becomes vanishingly weak that `temperature' appearing in thermodynamic\nrelations becomes universally defined and makes better physical sense.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Dec 2020 13:54:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-21"}

Nonetheless, Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping\n(Grad-CAM) and Randomly Input Sampling for Explanation (RISE) perform fairly\nwell in most of the metrics. Utilizing a set of filtered metrics, we further\npresent a case study to diagnose the classification bases for models. While\nproviding a comprehensive experimental study of metrics, we also examine\nmeasuring factors that are missed in current metrics and hope this valuable\nwork could serve as a guide for future research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Dec 2020 14:13:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-01"}

First, we show a\nreduction: the length of a regular expression for a language $L\\subseteq\n\\{0,1\\}^n$ is bounded from below by the minimum size of a monotone arithmetic\nformula computing a polynomial that has $L$ as its set of exponent vectors,\nviewing words as vectors. This result yields lower bounds for the binomial\nlanguage of all words with exactly $k$ ones and $n-k$ zeros and for the\nlanguage of all Dyck words of length $2n$.

Anisotropic electron interactions, on the other\nhand, have been a domain of correlated quantum phases, such as the T-invariant\nnematics or unconventional superconductors. Here we report discovery of a\nbroken-T phase of itinerant Bloch electrons with an unconventional anisotropic\nspin-momentum interaction, whose staggered nature leads to the formation of two\nferromagnetic-like valleys in the momentum space with opposite spin splittings.\nWe describe qualitatively the effect by deriving a non-relativistic\nsingle-particle Hamiltonian model. Next, we identify the unconventional\nstaggered spin-momentum interaction by first-principles electronic structure\ncalculations in a four-sublattice antiferromagnet Mn5Si3 with a collinear\ncheckerboard magnetic order.

An HBM-enabled device consists of multiple DRAM\nlayers stacked on top of one another next to a compute chip (e.g. CPU, GPU, and\nFPGA) in the same package. Although such HBM structures provide high bandwidth\nat a small form factor, the stacked memory layers consume a substantial portion\nof the package's power budget. Therefore, power-saving techniques that preserve\nthe performance of HBM are desirable. Undervolting is one such technique: it\nreduces the supply voltage to decrease power consumption without reducing the\ndevice's operating frequency to avoid performance loss. Undervolting takes\nadvantage of voltage guardbands put in place by manufacturers to ensure correct\noperation under all environmental conditions. However, reducing voltage without\nchanging frequency can lead to reliability issues manifested as unwanted bit\nflips. In this paper, we provide the first experimental study of real HBM chips\nunder reduced-voltage conditions. We show that the guardband regions for our\nHBM chips constitute 19% of the nominal voltage. Pushing the supply voltage\ndown within the guardband region reduces power consumption by a factor of 1.5X\nfor all bandwidth utilization rates.

The New York City public high school match illustrates\nthe latter, using test scores and other criteria to rank applicants at\n``screened'' schools, combined with lottery tie-breaking at unscreened\n``lottery'' schools. We show how to identify causal effects of school\nattendance in such settings. Our approach generalizes regression discontinuity\nmethods to allow for multiple treatments and multiple running variables, some\nof which are randomly assigned. The key to this generalization is a local\npropensity score that quantifies the school assignment probabilities induced by\nlottery and non-lottery tie-breakers. The local propensity score is applied in\nan empirical assessment of the predictive value of New York City's school\nreport cards. Schools that receive a high grade indeed improve SAT math scores\nand increase graduation rates, though by much less than OLS estimates suggest.\nSelection bias in OLS estimates is egregious for screened schools.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 31 Dec 2020 09:00:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-05"}

We designed an RFFI scheme for Long Range (LoRa) systems\nbased on spectrogram and convolutional neural network (CNN). Specifically, we\nused spectrogram to represent the fine-grained time-frequency characteristics\nof LoRa signals. In addition, we revealed that the instantaneous carrier\nfrequency offset (CFO) is drifting, which will result in misclassification and\nsignificantly compromise the system stability; we demonstrated CFO compensation\nis an effective mitigation. Finally, we designed a hybrid classifier that can\nadjust CNN outputs with the estimated CFO. The mean value of CFO remains\nrelatively stable, hence it can be used to rule out CNN predictions whose\nestimated CFO falls out of the range. We performed experiments in real wireless\nenvironments using 20 LoRa devices under test (DUTs) and a Universal Software\nRadio Peripheral (USRP) N210 receiver.
