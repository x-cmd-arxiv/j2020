It\nmay be involved in potassium accumulation \\textcolor{black}{including}\nspreading depression, perhaps migraine and some kinds of epilepsy, even\n(speculatively) learning. Quantitative analysis is likely to help evaluate the\nrole of potassium clearance from the extracellular space after a train of\naction potentials. Clearance involves three structures that extend down the\nlength of the nerve: glia, extracellular space, and axon and so need to be\ndescribed as systems distributed in space in the tradition used for electrical\npotential in the `cable equations' of nerve since the work of Hodgkin in 1937.\nA three-compartment model is proposed here for the optic nerve and is used to\nstudy the accumulation of potassium and its clearance. The model allows the\nconvection, diffusion, and electrical migration of water and ions. We depend on\nthe data of Orkand et al to ensure the relevance of our model and align its\nparameters with the anatomy and properties of membranes, channels, and\ntransporters: our model fits their experimental data quite well. The aligned\nmodel shows that glia has an important role in buffering potassium, as\nexpected. The model shows that potassium is cleared mostly by convective flow\nthrough the syncytia of glia driven by osmotic pressure differences. A\nsimplified model might be possible, but it must involve flow down the length of\nthe optic nerve. It is easy for compartment models to neglect this flow. Our\nmodel can be used for structures quite different from the optic nerve that\nmight have different distributions of channels and transporters in its three\ncompartments. It can be generalized to include a fourth (distributed)\ncompartment representing blood vessels to deal with the glymphatic flow into\nthe circulatory system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Dec 2020 16:12:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Apr 2021 13:04:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 16 May 2021 15:29:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-01"}

Difficulty settings\nin games are typically limited to few discrete tiers. For most serious\napplications in health, more fine-grained and far-reaching adjustments are\nrequired. The need for applying adjustments on complex sets of parameters can\nbe overwhelming for patient-players and even trained professionals. Automatic\nadaptivity and efficient manual adaptability are thus major concerns for the\ndesign and development of MGH. Despite a growing amount of research on specific\nmethods for adaptivity, general considerations on human-computer interaction\nwith adaptable and adaptive MGH are rare.

Working with older adults and\npeople with Parkinson's disease as frequent target groups that can benefit from\ntailored activities, explorations and comparative studies that investigate the\ndesign, acceptance, and effectiveness of MGH are presented.

The suggested\nframework allows to identify a number of challenges for the whole community of\ndecision analysts, both researchers and practitioners.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Dec 2020 16:46:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-08"}

To date, intrinsic\ncalibration models for spinning LiDARs have been based on hypothesized based on\ntheir physical mechanisms, resulting in anywhere from three to ten parameters\nto be estimated from data, while no phenomenological models have yet been\nproposed for solid-state LiDARs. Instead of going down that road, we propose to\nabstract away from the physics of a LiDAR type (spinning vs solid-state, for\nexample), and focus on the spatial geometry of the point cloud generated by the\nsensor. By modeling the calibration parameters as an element of a special\nmatrix Lie Group, we achieve a unifying view of calibration for different types\nof LiDARs. We further prove mathematically that the proposed model is\nwell-constrained (has a unique answer) given four appropriately orientated\ntargets. The proof provides a guideline for target positioning in the form of a\ntetrahedron. Moreover, an existing Semidefinite programming global solver for\nSE(3) can be modified to compute efficiently the optimal calibration\nparameters. For solid state LiDARs, we illustrate how the method works in\nsimulation.

We\naddress both concerns in our proposed design: we first place subjects into\npairs using optimal nonbipartite matching, making our estimator robust to\ncomplicated non-linear response models. Our innovation is to keep the matched\npairs extant, take differences of the covariate values within each matched pair\nand then we use the greedy switching heuristic of Krieger et al.

This rate benefits from the greedy switching heuristic\nwhich is $O_p(n^{-3})$ and the rate of matching which is $O_p(n^{-1})$.\nFurther, our resultant designs are shown to be as random as matching which is\nrobust to unobserved covariates.

These introduce digital threats to election\noutcomes. Risk-limiting audits (RLAs) mitigate threats to some of these systems\nby manually inspecting random samples of ballot cards. RLAs have a large chance\nof correcting wrong outcomes (by conducting a full manual tabulation of a\ntrustworthy record of the votes), but can save labor when reported outcomes are\ncorrect. This efficiency is eroded when sampling cannot be targeted to ballot\ncards that contain the contest(s) under audit. If the sample is drawn from all\ncast cards, RLA sample sizes scale like the reciprocal of the fraction of\nballot cards that contain the contest(s) under audit. That fraction shrinks as\nthe number of cards per ballot grows (i.e., when elections contain more\ncontests) and as the fraction of ballots that contain the contest decreases\n(i.e., when a smaller percentage of voters are eligible to vote in the\ncontest). States that conduct RLAs of contests on multi-card ballots or of\nsmall contests can dramatically reduce sample sizes by using information about\nwhich ballot cards contain which contests -- by keeping track of card-style\ndata (CSD). For instance, CSD reduces the expected number of draws needed to\naudit a single countywide contest on a 4-card ballot by 75%. Similarly, CSD\nreduces the expected number of draws by 95% or more for an audit of two\ncontests with the same margin on a 4-card ballot if one contest is on every\nballot and the other is on 10% of ballots.

These include kinematics resembling lateral undulation with very\nanisotropic friction, small-amplitude reciprocal kinematics, very large\namplitude kinematics near isotropic friction, and kinematics that are very\nasymmetric about the flat state. In the two-parameter shape space, zero net\nrotation for elliptical trajectories occurs mainly with bilateral or antipodal\nsymmetry.

The processing broadly\nfollowed the same procedures as for Gaia DR2, but with significant improvements\nto the modelling of observations.

With a few exceptions, deep neural networks (DNNs) have seldom been\napplied to density estimation, mostly due to the unsupervised nature of the\nestimation task, and (especially) due to the need for constrained training\nalgorithms that ended up realizing proper probabilistic models that satisfy\nKolmogorov's axioms. Moreover, in spite of the well-known improvement in terms\nof modeling capabilities yielded by mixture models over plain single-density\nstatistical estimators, no proper mixtures of multivariate DNN-based component\ndensities have been investigated so far. The paper fills this gap by extending\nour previous work on Neural Mixture Densities (NMMs) to multivariate DNN\nmixtures. A maximum-likelihood (ML) algorithm for estimating Deep NMMs (DNMMs)\nis handed out, which satisfies numerically a combination of hard and soft\nconstraints aimed at ensuring satisfaction of Kolmogorov's axioms. The class of\nprobability density functions that can be modeled to any degree of precision\nvia DNMMs is formally defined. A procedure for the automatic selection of the\nDNMM architecture, as well as of the hyperparameters for its ML training\nalgorithm, is presented (exploiting the probabilistic nature of the DNMM).\nExperimental results on univariate and multivariate data are reported on,\ncorroborating the effectiveness of the approach and its superiority to the most\npopular statistical estimation techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Dec 2020 23:03:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-08"}

A widely used strategy is to generate a complete point\ncloud from the incomplete one. However, the unordered nature of point clouds\nwill degrade the generation of high-quality 3D shapes, as the detailed topology\nand structure of discrete points are hard to be captured by the generative\nprocess only using a latent code. In this paper, we address the above problem\nby reconsidering the completion task from a new perspective, where we formulate\nthe prediction as a point cloud deformation process.

Such systems automatically detect critical fall\nevents and immediately alert medical professionals or caregivers. To support\nlong-term FD services, various power-saving strategies have been implemented.\nAmong them, a reduced sampling rate is a common approach for an\nenergy-efficient system in the real-world. However, the performance of FD\nsystems is diminished owing to low-resolution (LR) accelerometer signals. To\nimprove the detection accuracy with LR accelerometer signals, several technical\nchallenges must be considered, including misalignment, mismatch of effective\nfeatures, and the degradation effects. In this work, a deep-learning-based\naccelerometer signal enhancement (ASE) model is proposed to improve the\ndetection performance of LR-FD systems. This proposed model reconstructs\nhigh-resolution (HR) signals from the LR signals by learning the relationship\nbetween the LR and HR signals.

The forecaster is called\nwell-calibrated if for each $p \\in [0, 1]$, among the $n_p$ bits for which the\nforecaster predicts probability $p$, the actual number of ones, $m_p$, is\nindeed equal to $p \\cdot n_p$. The calibration error, defined as $\\sum_p |m_p -\np n_p|$, quantifies the extent to which the forecaster deviates from being\nwell-calibrated.

Although impressive results\nhave been achieved with conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs),\nthe existing cGANs-based methods typically use a single network to learn\nvarious aging effects between any two different age groups. However, they\ncannot simultaneously meet three essential requirements of face aging --\nincluding image quality, aging accuracy, and identity preservation -- and\nusually generate aged faces with strong ghost artifacts when the age gap\nbecomes large. Inspired by the fact that faces gradually age over time, this\npaper proposes a novel progressive face aging framework based on generative\nadversarial network (PFA-GAN) to mitigate these issues. Unlike the existing\ncGANs-based methods, the proposed framework contains several sub-networks to\nmimic the face aging process from young to old, each of which only learns some\nspecific aging effects between two adjacent age groups. The proposed framework\ncan be trained in an end-to-end manner to eliminate accumulative artifacts and\nblurriness. Moreover, this paper introduces an age estimation loss to take into\naccount the age distribution for an improved aging accuracy, and proposes to\nuse the Pearson correlation coefficient as an evaluation metric measuring the\naging smoothness for face aging methods.

The different grades or classes of ophthalmic images may be share\nsimilar overall performance but have subtle differences that can be\ndifferentiated by mining salient regions. To address this issue, we propose a\nnovel end-to-end network, named Attention-based Saliency Hashing (ASH), for\nlearning compact hash-code to represent ophthalmic images. ASH embeds a\nspatial-attention module to focus more on the representation of salient regions\nand highlights their essential role in differentiating ophthalmic images.\nBenefiting from the spatial-attention module, the information of salient\nregions can be mapped into the hash-code for similarity calculation. In the\ntraining stage, we input the image pairs to share the weights of the network,\nand a pairwise loss is designed to maximize the discriminability of the\nhash-code. In the retrieval stage, ASH obtains the hash-code by inputting an\nimage with an end-to-end manner, then the hash-code is used to similarity\ncalculation to return the most similar images. Extensive experiments on two\ndifferent modalities of ophthalmic image datasets demonstrate that the proposed\nASH can further improve the retrieval performance compared to the\nstate-of-the-art deep hashing methods due to the huge contributions of the\nspatial-attention module.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Dec 2020 06:04:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-04"}

However, most existing methods for message passing simply sum\nor average all the neighboring features to update node representations. They\nare restricted by two problems, i.e., (i) lack of interpretability to identify\nnode features significant to the prediction of GNNs, and (ii) feature\nover-mixing that leads to the over-smoothing issue in capturing long-range\ndependencies and inability to handle graphs under heterophily or low homophily.\nIn this paper, we propose a Node-level Capsule Graph Neural Network (NCGNN) to\naddress these problems with an improved message passing scheme. Specifically,\nNCGNN represents nodes as groups of node-level capsules, in which each capsule\nextracts distinctive features of its corresponding node. For each node-level\ncapsule, a novel dynamic routing procedure is developed to adaptively select\nappropriate capsules for aggregation from a subgraph identified by the designed\ngraph filter. NCGNN aggregates only the advantageous capsules and restrains\nirrelevant messages to avoid over-mixing features of interacting nodes.\nTherefore, it can relieve the over-smoothing issue and learn effective node\nrepresentations over graphs with homophily or heterophily. Furthermore, our\nproposed message passing scheme is inherently interpretable and exempt from\ncomplex post-hoc explanations, as the graph filter and the dynamic routing\nprocedure identify a subset of node features that are most significant to the\nmodel prediction from the extracted subgraph. Extensive experiments on\nsynthetic as well as real-world graphs demonstrate that NCGNN can well address\nthe over-smoothing issue and produce better node representations for\nsemisupervised node classification.

Intuitively, it is\nespecially challenging as (both regular and few-shot) supervised pre-training\ntends to learn to ignore intra-class variability which is essential for\nseparating sub-classes. In this paper, we introduce a novel 'Angular\nnormalization' module that allows to effectively combine supervised and\nself-supervised contrastive pre-training to approach the proposed C2FS task,\ndemonstrating significant gains in a broad study over multiple baselines and\ndatasets. We hope that this work will help to pave the way for future research\non this new, challenging, and very practical topic of C2FS classification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Dec 2020 08:09:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 6 Jun 2021 14:17:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 22 Jun 2021 09:39:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-23"}

This defect was overcome by a recent approach that solves the more\nactual macroscopic equations obtained through Taylor series expansion analysis\nof the lattice Boltzmann equations [Lu et al., J. Comp. Phys., 415, 109546\n(2020)]. The key is to keep some small additional terms (SATs) to stabilize the\nnumerical solution of the weakly compressible Navier-Stokes equations. However,\nthere are many SATs that complicate the implementation of their method. Based\non some analyses and numerous tests, we ultimately pinpoint two essential\ningredients for stable simulations: (1) suitable density (pressure) diffusion\nadded to the continuity equation; (2) proper numerical dissipation related to\nthe velocity divergence added to the momentum equations. Then, we propose a\nsimplified method that is not only easier to implement but noticeably faster\nthan the original method and the LBM.

Besides, it is extended for two-phase flows with uniform\ndensity and viscosity.

The use of these techniques as a game design\ntool for video game production, where the aim is instead to create Non-Player\nCharacter (NPC) behaviors, has received relatively little attention until\nrecently. Turn-based strategy games like Roguelikes, for example, present\nunique challenges to DRL. In particular, the categorical nature of their\ncomplex game state, composed of many entities with different attributes,\nrequires agents able to learn how to compare and prioritize these entities.\nMoreover, this complexity often leads to agents that overfit to states seen\nduring training and that are unable to generalize in the face of design changes\nmade during development. In this paper we propose two network architectures\nwhich, when combined with a \\emph{procedural loot generation} system, are able\nto better handle complex categorical state spaces and to mitigate the need for\nretraining forced by design decisions.

In general, the\nBCI system requires a calibration procedure to acquire subject/session-specific\ndata to tune the model every time the system is used. This problem is\nrecognized as a major obstacle to BCI, and to overcome it, an approach based on\ndomain generalization (DG) has recently emerged. The main purpose of this paper\nis to reconsider how the zero-calibration problem of BCI for a realistic\nsituation can be overcome from the perspective of DG tasks. In terms of the\nrealistic situation, we have focused on creating an EEG classification\nframework that can be applied directly in unseen sessions, using only\nmulti-subject/-session data acquired previously. Therefore, in this paper, we\ntested four deep learning models and four DG algorithms through\nleave-one-session-out validation. Our experiment showed that deeper and larger\nmodels were effective in cross-session generalization performance. Furthermore,\nwe found that none of the explicit DG algorithms outperformed empirical risk\nminimization. Finally, by comparing the results of fine-tuning using\nsubject-specific data, we found that subject-specific data may deteriorate\nunseen session classification performance due to inter-session variability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Dec 2020 08:47:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-08"}

To resolve this, we propose a new structure learning\nalgorithm LEAST, which comprehensively fulfills our business requirements as it\nattains high accuracy, efficiency and scalability at the same time. The core\nidea of LEAST is to formulate the structure learning into a continuous\nconstrained optimization problem, with a novel differentiable constraint\nfunction measuring the acyclicity of the resulting graph. Unlike with existing\nwork, our constraint function is built on the spectral radius of the graph and\ncould be evaluated in near linear time w.r.t. the graph node size.

According to\nour benchmark evaluation, LEAST runs 1 to 2 orders of magnitude faster than\nstate of the art method with comparable accuracy, and it is able to scale on\nBNs with up to hundreds of thousands of variables. In our production\nenvironment, LEAST is deployed and serves for more than 20 applications with\nthousands of executions per day.

However, existing STD\nalgorithms face the problem of intermediate variables explosion which results\nfrom the fact that the formation of those variables, i.e., matrices Khatri-Rao\nproduct, Kronecker product, and matrix-matrix multiplication, follows the whole\nelements in sparse tensor. The above problems prevent deep fusion of efficient\ncomputation and big data platforms. To overcome the bottleneck, a novel\nstochastic optimization strategy (SGD$\\_$Tucker) is proposed for STD which can\nautomatically divide the high-dimension intermediate variables into small\nbatches of intermediate matrices. Specifically, SGD$\\_$Tucker only follows the\nrandomly selected small samples rather than the whole elements, while\nmaintaining the overall accuracy and convergence rate. In practice,\nSGD$\\_$Tucker features the two distinct advancements over the state of the art.\nFirst, SGD$\\_$Tucker can prune the communication overhead for the core tensor\nin distributed settings. Second, the low data-dependence of SGD$\\_$Tucker\nenables fine-grained parallelization, which makes SGD$\\_$Tucker obtaining lower\ncomputational overheads with the same accuracy.

Even though previous studies have shown that the liver stiffness\nmeasured by elastography could predict portal hypertension in patients with\nchronic liver disease, the mechanisms behind remain today poorly understood.\nThe main reason is that the liver stiffness is not specific to portal\nhypertension and is also influenced by concomitant pathologies, such as\ncirrhosis. Portal hypertension is also source of a vascular incidence, with a\nsubstantial diversion of portal venous blood to the systemic circulation,\nbypassing the liver. This study focuses on this vascular effect of portal\nhypertension. We propose to generate and control the portal venous flow (to\nisolate the modifications in the portal venous flow as single effect of portal\nhypertension) in an anesthetized pig and then to quantify its implications on\nliver stiffness by an original combination of MRE and 4D-Flow Magnetic\nResonance Imaging (MRI). A catheter balloon is progressively inflated in the\nportal vein and the peak flow, peak velocity magnitude and liver stiffness are\nquantified in a 1.5T MRI scanner (AREA, Siemens Healthcare, Erlangen, Germany).\nA strong correlation is observed between the portal peak velocity magnitude,\nthe portal peak flow or the liver stiffness and the portal vein intraluminal\nobstruction. Moreover, the comparison of mechanical and flow parameters\nhighlights a correlation with the possibility of identifying linear\nrelationships. These results give preliminary indications about how liver\nstiffness can be affected by portal venous flow and, by extension, by\nhypertension.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Dec 2020 09:40:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-08"}

In particular\nwe are interested in locating speech sources, as they are of high interest for\nhuman-robot interaction. The microphone-pair response corresponding to the\ndirect-path sound propagation is a function of the source direction. In\npractice, this response is contaminated by noise and reverberations. The\ndirect-path relative transfer function (DP-RTF) is defined as the ratio between\nthe direct-path acoustic transfer function (ATF) of the two microphones, and it\nis an important feature for SSL. We propose a method to estimate the DP-RTF\nfrom noisy and reverberant signals in the short-time Fourier transform (STFT)\ndomain. First, the convolutive transfer function (CTF) approximation is adopted\nto accurately represent the impulse response of the microphone array, and the\nfirst coefficient of the CTF is mainly composed of the direct-path ATF. At each\nfrequency, the frame-wise speech auto- and cross-power spectral density (PSD)\nare obtained by spectral subtraction. Then a set of linear equations is\nconstructed by the speech auto- and cross-PSD of multiple frames, in which the\nDP-RTF is an unknown variable, and is estimated by solving the equations.\nFinally, the estimated DP-RTFs are concatenated across frequencies and used as\na feature vector for SSL.

We\nfind that the major difference in multi-layer metasurfaces when compared to\nconventional single-layer structures appears to be in Rayleigh-Wood anomalies:\nthey are split into multiple different modes which are themselves spectrally\nbroadened. As a proof of concept we cover a double-layer metasurface with a\nlanthanide-doped up-conversion particle layer and study its interaction with a\n1550 nm photoexcitation. We observe a 2.7-fold enhancemed up-conversion\nphotoluminescence by using the stacked metasurface instead of a planar\nsubstrate, although only around 1% of the up-conversion material is exposed to\nenhanced near-fields. Two mechanisms are identified explaining this behavior:\nFirst, enhanced near-fields when exciting the metasurface resonantly, and\nsecond, light trapping by total internal reflection in the particle layer when\nthe metasurface redirects light into high-angle diffraction orders. These\nresults pave the way for low-threshold and, in particular, broadband photon\nup-conversion in future solar energy and biosensing applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Dec 2020 11:04:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-08"}

The simulation was carried in the vertical circular pipe using the SST\nk-omega turbulence model for different sets of heat flux (220kW/m2 & 1810kW/m2)\nand mass flow rate (0.0106kg/s &0.022kg/s) at a maximum pressure of 25.3MPa.\nThe presence of roughness was incorporated as a uniform sand-grain roughness on\nthe heated wall. As a result, HTD recuperated gradually as the roughness height\n(Ks) was increased. The mitigation of HTD is a direct consequence of the\nincrease in turbulent kinetic energy (TKE). In contrast, the delay in the onset\nof HTD is due to the decrease in the dominant forces (buoyancy or acceleration\neffects) responsible for HTD occurrence. An equivalent thermal resistance model\nwas proposed to elucidate the same. Additionally, the heat transfer coefficient\nreduces (HTDn) near the outlet at higher roughness values where HTD has\ncompletely recovered. This is attributed to the high specific heat value around\nthe pseudocritical temperature. In the end, the efficacy of the roughness was\nanalyzed using two methods: entropy generation and thermal performance factor.\nBoth techniques suggest that the use of rough pipe is beneficial. However, the\nfirst method recommends using a Ks value greater than the critical roughness\nheight (Ksc): as the total entropy generation was found to peak at Ksc because\nof the thermal conductivity variation with temperature. The study revealed high\nsensitivity of maximum wall temperature and HTD onset to roughness presence. In\naddition, contrary to usual HTD, a new type of heat transfer impairment (HTDn)\ncan occur without any loss of TKE.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Dec 2020 11:21:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Aug 2021 12:32:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-31"}

However, challenges\nsuch as large scale variation, complex background interference, and non-uniform\ndensity distribution greatly limit the counting accuracy, particularly striking\nin remote sensing imagery. To mitigate the above issues, this paper proposes a\nnovel framework for dense object counting in remote sensing images, which\nincorporates a pyramidal scale module (PSM) and a global context module (GCM),\ndubbed PSGCNet, where PSM is used to adaptively capture multi-scale information\nand GCM is to guide the model to select suitable scales generated from PSM.\nMoreover, a reliable supervision manner improved from Bayesian and Counting\nloss (BCL) is utilized to learn the density probability and then compute the\ncount expectation at each annotation. It can relieve non-uniform density\ndistribution to a certain extent. Extensive experiments on four remote sensing\ncounting datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method and the\nsuperiority of it compared with state-of-the-arts.

In this\npaper, we propose a self-supervised DL method for reading analysis and evaluate\nit on two classification tasks. We first evaluate the proposed self-supervised\nDL method on a four-class classification task on reading detection using\nelectrooculography (EOG) glasses datasets, followed by an evaluation of a\ntwo-class classification task of confidence estimation on answers of\nmultiple-choice questions (MCQs) using eye-tracking datasets. Fully-supervised\nDL and support vector machines (SVMs) are used to compare the performance of\nthe proposed self-supervised DL method. The results show that the proposed\nself-supervised DL method is superior to the fully-supervised DL and SVM for\nboth tasks, especially when training data is scarce. This result indicates that\nthe proposed self-supervised DL method is the superior choice for reading\nanalysis tasks. The results of this study are important for informing the\ndesign and implementation of automatic reading analysis platforms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Dec 2020 11:36:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-08"}

The novel idea here presented lies on taking\nadvantage of the redundancy of the human kinematic chain involved in a task to\ncontrol an extra degree of actuation (DoA). This concept is summarized in the\ndefinition of the Implicit Kinematic Kernel (IKK). As first investigation, we\ndeveloped a procedure for the real time analysis of the body posture and the\nconsequent computation of the IKK-based control signal in the case of\nsingle-arm tasks. We considered both bio-mechanical and physiological human\nfeatures and constraints to allow for an efficient and intuitive control\napproach.

A systematic literature review, based on Prisma, is designed to\nprovide a state-of-the-art review on capacity social capital in this realm. The\noutput of this method led to finding 39 related articles. Studying these\narticles illustrates that social capital improves food security through two\nmechanisms of knowledge sharing and product sharing (i.e., sharing food\nproducts). It reveals that social capital through improving the food security\npillars (i.e., food availability, food accessibility, food utilization, and\nfood system stability) affects food security. In other words, the interaction\namong the community members results in sharing food products and information\namong community members, which facilitates food availability and access to\nfood. There are many shreds of evidence in the literature that sharing food and\nfood products among the community member decreases household food security and\nprovides healthy nutrition to vulnerable families and improves the food\nutilization pillar of food security. It is also disclosed that belonging to the\nsocial networks increases the community members' resilience and decreases the\ncommunity's vulnerability that subsequently strengthens the stability of a food\nsystem.

The reason is to understand the\nexact security posture of an organization network environment at any given\ntime. This is driven by the fact that modern network environments do, not only\npresent new opportunities to organizations but also a different set of new and\ncomplex cybersecurity challenges that need to be resolved daily.

By considering the\ndownlink of a multi-cluster scenario, the IRSs assist the base station (BS) to\nmultiplex subsets of users in the polarization domain. Our novel strategy\nalleviates the impact of imperfect SIC and enables users to exploit\npolarization diversity with near-zero inter-subset interference. To this end,\nthe IRSs are optimized to mitigate transmissions originated at the BS from the\ninterfering polarization. The formulated optimization is transformed into\nquadratic constrained quadratic sub-problems, which makes it possible to obtain\nthe optimal solution via interior-points methods. We also derive analytically a\nclosed-form expression for the users' ergodic rates by considering large\nnumbers of reflecting elements. This is followed by representative simulation\nexamples and comprehensive discussions.

For the Sun, inversions of helioseismic\ndata indicate that the radial profile of angular velocity in its radiative zone\nis nearly uniform, which implies the existence of angular momentum transport\nmechanisms. While there are many independent transport models for angular\nmomentum and chemical species, there is a lack of self-consistent theories that\npermit stellar evolution models to simultaneously match the present-day\nobservations of solar lithium abundances and radial rotation profiles. We\nexplore how additional transport processes can improve the agreement between\nevolutionary models of rotating stars and observations. We constrain the\nresulting models by simultaneously using the evolution of the surface rotation\nrate and Li abundance in the solar-type stars of open clusters, and the solar\nsurface and internal rotation profile as inverted from helioseismology. We show\nthe relevance of penetrative convection for the depletion of Li. The rotational\ndependence of the depth of penetrative convection yields an anti-correlation\nbetween the initial rotation rate and Li depletion in our models of solar-type\nstars that is in agreement with the observed trend. Simultaneously, the\naddition of an ad hoc vertical viscosity leads to efficient transport of\nangular momentum between the core and the envelope. We also self-consistently\ncompute for the first time the thickness of the tachocline and find that it is\ncompatible with helioseismic estimations.

For these systems the planet masses were large\nenough to open at least a partial gap in their discs as they approach the\nbinary, forcing the discs to become circularized and allowing for further\nmigration towards the binary, leading to good agreement with the observed\nplanetary orbital parameters.\n  For systems with very small or large binary eccentricities the match was not\nas good because the very eccentric discs and large inner cavities in these\ncases prevented close-in planet migration. In test simulations with higher than\nobserved planet masses better agreement could be found for those systems.\n  The good agreement for 6 out of the 10 modelled systems, where the relative\ndifference between observed and simulated final planet orbit is $\\leq 10\\%$,\nstrongly supports the idea that planet migration in the disc brought the\nplanets to their present locations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Dec 2020 13:07:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-13"}

For this crash-recovery shared\nmemory model, strict-linearizability is considered appropriate since, unlike\nlinearizability, it ensures operations that crash take effect prior to the\ncrash or not at all.\n  This work formalizes and answers the question of whether an implementation of\na data type derived for the crash-stop shared memory model is also\nstrict-linearizable in the crash-recovery model. This work presents a rigorous\nstudy to prove how helping mechanisms, typically employed by non-blocking\nimplementations, is the algorithmic abstraction that delineates linearizability\nfrom strict-linearizability. Our first contribution formalizes the\ncrash-recovery model and how explicit process crashes and recovery introduces\nfurther dimensionalities over the standard crash-stop shared memory model. We\nmake the following technical contributions: (i) we prove that\nstrict-linearizability is independent of any known help definition; (ii) we\nthen present a natural definition of help-freedom to prove that any\nobstruction-free, linearizable and help-free implementation of a total object\ntype is also strict-linearizable; (iii) finally, we prove that for a large\nclass of object types, a non-blocking strict-linearizable implementation cannot\nhave helping.

Numerous ST\nprotocols provide high reliability and energy efficiency in normal wireless\nconditions, for a large variety of traffic requirements. Recently, with the\nEWSN dependability competitions, the community pushed ST to harsher and\nhighly-interfered environments, improving upon classical ST protocols through\nthe use of custom rules, hand-tailored parameters, and additional\nretransmissions. The results are sophisticated protocols, that require prior\nexpert knowledge and extensive testing, often tuned for a specific deployment\nand envisioned scenario. In this paper, we explore how ST protocols can benefit\nfrom self-adaptivity; a self-adaptive ST protocol selects itself its best\nparameters to (1) tackle external environment dynamics and (2) adapt to its\ntopology over time. We introduce Dimmer as a self-adaptive ST protocol. Dimmer\nbuilds on LWB and uses Reinforcement Learning to tune its parameters and match\nthe current properties of the wireless medium. By learning how to behave from\nan unlabeled dataset, Dimmer adapts to different interference types and\npatterns, and is able to tackle previously unseen interference.

The most critical\nchallenge is how to formulate the dynamic model of wind farm for dynamic\ncontrol, since it is essentially is nonlinear and there are huge amount of\nparameters to be maintained frequently. This paper proposes a data-driven model\npredictive control (data-driven MPC) method to make wind farms participate\nprimary frequency regulation. In this method,a specialized dynamic mode\ndecomposition (SDMD) algorithm is developed, which can linearly approximate the\ndynamics of wind farm from measurements based on Koopman operator\ntheory.Compared with the existing extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD)\nmethod,this tailored SDMD has two advantages: 1) fully capturing the nonlinear\ntransients of wind turbine dynamics with good accuracy under a wide range of\nworking conditions; 2) much less computational burden with model dimensionality\nreduction. Based on the recursively updated linear dynamic model, a model\npredictive control solution is implemented.

In particular, the fact that it takes a quantum-like model to\ncombine meaning and structure, establishes QNLP as quantum-native, on par with\nsimulation of quantum systems. Moreover, the now leading Noisy\nIntermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) paradigm for encoding classical data on\nquantum hardware, variational quantum circuits, makes NISQ exceptionally\nQNLP-friendly: linguistic structure can be encoded as a free lunch, in contrast\nto the apparently exponentially expensive classical encoding of grammar.\n  Quantum speed-up for QNLP tasks has already been established in previous work\nwith Will Zeng. Here we provide a broader range of tasks which all enjoy the\nsame advantage.\n  Diagrammatic reasoning is at the heart of QNLP. Firstly, the quantum model\ninterprets language as quantum processes via the diagrammatic formalism of\ncategorical quantum mechanics. Secondly, these diagrams are via ZX-calculus\ntranslated into quantum circuits. Parameterisations of meanings then become the\ncircuit variables to be learned.\n  Our encoding of linguistic structure within quantum circuits also embodies a\nnovel approach for establishing word-meanings that goes beyond the current\nstandards in mainstream AI, by placing linguistic structure at the heart of\nWittgenstein's meaning-is-context.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Dec 2020 14:49:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-08"}

These weak\nobservational signatures mean that little is currently understood about the\nphysics of these events. We present an extensive study of the magnetic field\nconfiguration in which the stealth CME of 3 March 2011 occurred. Three distinct\nepisodes of flare ribbon formation are observed in the stealth CME source\nactive region (AR). Two occurred prior to the eruption and suggest the\noccurrence of magnetic reconnection that builds the structure which will become\neruptive. The third occurs in a time close to the eruption of a cavity that is\nobserved in STEREO-B 171A data; this subsequently becomes part of the\npropagating CME observed in coronagraph data. We use both local (Cartesian) and\nglobal (spherical) models of the coronal magnetic field, which are complemented\nand verified by the observational analysis. We find evidence of a coronal null\npoint, with field lines computed from its neighbourhood connecting the stealth\nCME source region to two ARs in the northern hemisphere. We conclude that\nreconnection at the null point aids the eruption of the stealth CME by removing\nfield that acted to stabilise the pre-eruptive structure. This stealth CME,\ndespite its weak signatures, has the main characteristics of other CMEs, and\nits eruption is driven by similar mechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Dec 2020 14:50:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-24"}

In this paper, we propose a novel\nsparse LiDAR point cloud semantic segmentation framework assisted by learned\ncontextual shape priors. In practice, an initial semantic segmentation (SS) of\na single sweep point cloud can be achieved by any appealing network and then\nflows into the semantic scene completion (SSC) module as the input. By merging\nmultiple frames in the LiDAR sequence as supervision, the optimized SSC module\nhas learned the contextual shape priors from sequential LiDAR data, completing\nthe sparse single sweep point cloud to the dense one. Thus, it inherently\nimproves SS optimization through fully end-to-end training. Besides, a\nPoint-Voxel Interaction (PVI) module is proposed to further enhance the\nknowledge fusion between SS and SSC tasks, i.e., promoting the interaction of\nincomplete local geometry of point cloud and complete voxel-wise global\nstructure. Furthermore, the auxiliary SSC and PVI modules can be discarded\nduring inference without extra burden for SS.

In this work, we address the problem of\nestimating object poses from touch during planar pushing. Vision-based tactile\nsensors provide rich, local image measurements at the point of contact. A\nsingle such measurement, however, contains limited information and multiple\nmeasurements are needed to infer latent object state. We solve this inference\nproblem using a factor graph. In order to incorporate tactile measurements in\nthe graph, we need local observation models that can map high-dimensional\ntactile images onto a low-dimensional state space. Prior work has used\nlow-dimensional force measurements or engineered functions to interpret tactile\nmeasurements. These methods, however, can be brittle and difficult to scale\nacross objects and sensors. Our key insight is to directly learn tactile\nobservation models that predict the relative pose of the sensor given a pair of\ntactile images. These relative poses can then be incorporated as factors within\na factor graph. We propose a two-stage approach: first we learn local tactile\nobservation models supervised with ground truth data, and then integrate these\nmodels along with physics and geometric factors within a factor graph\noptimizer. We demonstrate reliable object tracking using only tactile feedback\nfor 150 real-world planar pushing sequences with varying trajectories across\nthree object shapes.

A quantum-chemical bond analysis reveals that this bond differs\nsignificantly from ionic, metallic or covalent bonds.

To address these limitations, we design a\ncompositional neural network that predicts the silhouette, garment labels, and\ntextures.

An\nappearance of $\\bar{\\nu}_e$ in solar neutrino flux opens a new window for the\nnew physics beyond the standard model. In particular, a spin-flavor precession\nprocess is expected to convert an electron neutrino into an electron\nanti-neutrino (${\\nu_e\\to\\bar{\\nu}_e}$) when neutrino has a finite magnetic\nmoment. In this work, we have searched for solar $\\bar{\\nu}_e$ in the\nSuper-Kamiokande experiment, using neutron tagging to identify their inverse\nbeta decay signature.

Extending IPC to thin structures poses new\nchallenges in computing strain, modeling thickness and determining collisions.\nTo address these challenges we propose three corresponding contributions.\nFirst, we introduce a C2 constitutive barrier model that directly enforces\nstrain limiting as an energy potential while preserving rest state. This\nprovides energetically-consistent strain limiting models (both isotropic and\nanisotropic) for cloth that enable strict satisfaction of strain-limit\ninequalities with direct coupling to both elastodynamics and contact via\nminimization of the incremental potential. Second, to capture the geometric\nthickness of codimensional domains we extend the IPC model to directly enforce\ndistance offsets. Our treatment imposes a strict guarantee that mid-surfaces\n(resp. mid-lines) of shells (resp. rods) will not move closer than applied\nthickness values. This enables us to account for thickness in the contact\nbehavior of codimensional structures and so robustly capture challenging\ncontacting geometries; a number of which, to our knowledge, have not been\nsimulated before.

In order to adapt\nand transfer models across image acquisitions, one must be able to cope with\ndatasets that are not co-registered, acquired under different illumination and\natmospheric conditions, by different sensors, and with scarce ground\nreferences. Traditionally, methods based on histogram matching have been used.\nHowever, they fail when densities have very different shapes or when there is\nno corresponding band to be matched between the images. An alternative builds\nupon \\emph{manifold alignment}. Manifold alignment performs a multidimensional\nrelative normalization of the data prior to product generation that can cope\nwith data of different dimensionality (e.g. different number of bands) and\npossibly unpaired examples. Aligning data distributions is an appealing\nstrategy, since it allows to provide data spaces that are more similar to each\nother, regardless of the subsequent use of the transformed data. In this paper,\nwe study a methodology that aligns data from different domains in a nonlinear\nway through {\\em kernelization}. We introduce the Kernel Manifold Alignment\n(KEMA) method, which provides a flexible and discriminative projection map,\nexploits only a few labeled samples (or semantic ties) in each domain, and\nreduces to solving a generalized eigenvalue problem. We successfully test KEMA\nin multi-temporal and multi-source very high resolution classification tasks,\nas well as on the task of making a model invariant to shadowing for\nhyperspectral imaging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Dec 2020 08:46:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-09"}

In recent years, Gaussian\nProcess (GP) regression has excelled in biophysical parameter estimation tasks\nfrom airborne and satellite observations. GP regression is based on solid\nBayesian statistics and generally yields efficient and accurate parameter\nestimates. However, GPs are typically used for inverse modeling based on\nconcurrent observations and in situ measurements only. Very often a forward\nmodel encoding the well-understood physical relations between the state vector\nand the radiance observations is available though and could be useful to\nimprove predictions and understanding. In this work, we review three GP models\nthat respect and learn the physics of the underlying processes in the context\nof both forward and inverse modeling. After reviewing the traditional\napplication of GPs for parameter retrieval, we introduce a Joint GP (JGP) model\nthat combines in situ measurements and simulated data in a single GP model.\nThen, we present a latent force model (LFM) for GP modeling that encodes\nordinary differential equations to blend data-driven modeling and physical\nconstraints of the system governing equations. The LFM performs multi-output\nregression, adapts to the signal characteristics, is able to cope with missing\ndata in the time series, and provides explicit latent functions that allow\nsystem analysis and evaluation. Finally, we present an Automatic Gaussian\nProcess Emulator (AGAPE) that approximates the forward physical model using\nconcepts from Bayesian optimization and at the same time builds an optimally\ncompact look-up-table for inversion.

Because these models take long processing time, the common practice\nis to first generate a sparse look-up table (LUT) and then make use of\ninterpolation methods to sample the multi-dimensional LUT input variable space.\nHowever, the question arise whether common interpolation methods perform most\naccurate. As an alternative to interpolation, this work proposes to use\nemulation, i.e., approximating the RTM output by means of statistical learning.\nTwo experiments were conducted to assess the accuracy in delivering spectral\noutputs using interpolation and emulation: (1) at canopy level, using PROSAIL;\nand (2) at top-of-atmosphere level, using MODTRAN. Various interpolation\n(nearest-neighbour, inverse distance weighting, piece-wice linear) and\nemulation (Gaussian process regression (GPR), kernel ridge regression, neural\nnetworks) methods were evaluated against a dense reference LUT. In all\nexperiments, the emulation methods clearly produced more accurate output\nspectra than classical interpolation methods. GPR emulation performed up to ten\ntimes more accurately than the best performing interpolation method, and this\nwith a speed that is competitive with the faster interpolation methods. It is\nconcluded that emulation can function as a fast and more accurate alternative\nto commonly used interpolation methods for reconstructing RTM spectral data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Dec 2020 10:04:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-21"}

However, given current and\nnear-term hardware limitations, the number of variables required to express a\nlarge real-world problem easily exceeds the hardware capabilities, thus hybrid\nmethods are usually developed in order to utilize the hardware. In this work,\nwe advocate for the development of hybrid methods that are built on top of the\nframeworks of existing state-of-art heuristics, thereby improving these\nmethods. We demonstrate this by building on the so called Louvain method, which\nis one of the most popular algorithms for the Community detection problem and\ndevelop and Ising-based Louvain method. The proposed method outperforms two\nstate-of-the-art community detection algorithms in clustering several small to\nlarge-scale graphs. The results show promise in adapting the same optimization\napproach to other unsupervised learning heuristics to improve their\nperformance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Dec 2020 20:11:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-08"}
