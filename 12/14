The kind of information involved\nin consciousness needs to be quantum for multiple reasons, including its\nintrinsic privacy and its power of building up thoughts by entangling qualia\nstates. As a result we reach a quantum-information-based panpsychism, with\nclassical physics supervening on quantum physics, quantum physics supervening\non quantum information, and quantum information supervening on consciousness.\nWe then argue that the internally experienced quantum state, since it\ncorresponds to a definite experience-not to a random choice-must be pure, and\nwe call it ontic, in contrast with the state predictable from the outside (i.e.\nthe state describing the knowledge of the experience from the point of view of\nan external observer) which we call epistemic and is generally mixed. Purity of\nthe ontic state requires an evolution that is purity preserving, namely a\nso-called 'atomic' quantum operation. The latter is generally probabilistic,\nand its particular outcome is interpreted as the free will, which is\nunpredictable even in principle since quantum probability cannot be interpreted\nas lack of knowledge. The same purity of state and evolution allows solving the\n'combination problem' of panpsychism. Quantum state evolution accounts for a\nshort-term buffer of experience and contains itself quantum-to-classical and\nclassical-to-quantum information transfers. Long term memory, on the other\nhand, is classical, and needs memorization and recall processes that are\nquantum-to-classical and classical-to-quantum, respectively...\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2020 11:04:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2021 09:59:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-29"}

This affects the evolution of\nglobular clusters (GCs) owing to the different mass-loss rates and the number\nof black holes formed. Previous numerical modeling of GCs usually assumed an\ninvariant canonical IMF. Using the state-of-the-art $NBODY6$ code, we perform a\ncomprehensive series of direct $N$-body simulations to study the evolution of\nstar clusters, starting with a top-heavy IMF and undergoing early gas\nexpulsion. Utilizing the embedded cluster mass-radius relation of Marks &\nKroupa (2012) for initializing the models, and by varying the degree of\ntop-heaviness, we calculate the minimum cluster mass needed for the cluster to\nsurvive longer than 12 Gyr. We document how the evolution of different\ncharacteristics of star clusters such as the total mass, the final size, the\ndensity, the mass-to-light ratio, the population of stellar remnants, and the\nsurvival of GCs is influenced by the degree of top-heaviness. We find that the\nlifetimes of clusters with different IMFs moving on the same orbit are\nproportional to the relaxation time to a power of $x$ that is in the range of\n0.8 to 1. The observed correlation between concentration and the mass function\nslope in Galactic GCs can be accounted for excellently in models starting with\na top-heavy IMF and undergoing an early phase of rapid gas expulsion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Dec 2020 16:34:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-15"}

By far the most well studied examples concern physical\ninteractions through a fluid: beating cilia, swimming sperm and worms, and\nflapping wings, all display synchronization behavior through fluid mechanical\ninteractions. However, as the density of a collective increases individuals may\nalso interact with each other through physical contact. In the field of \"active\nmatter\" systems, it is well known that inelastic contact between individuals\ncan produce long-range correlations in position, orientation, and velocity. In\nthis work we demonstrate that contact interactions between undulating robots\nyield novel phase dynamics such as synchronized motions. We consider undulatory\nsystems in which rhythmic motion emerges from time-independent oscillators that\nsense and respond to undulatory bending angle and speed. In pair experiments we\ndemonstrate that robot joints will synchronize to in-phase and anti-phase\noscillations through collisions and a phase-oscillator model describes the\nstability of these modes. To understand how contact interactions influence the\nphase dynamics of larger groups we perform simulations and experiments of\nsimple three-link undulatory robots that interact only through contact.\nCollectives synchronize their movements through contact as predicted by the\ntheory and when the robots can adjust their position in response to contact we\nno longer observe anti-phase synchronization. Lastly we demonstrate that\nsynchronization dramatically reduces the interaction forces within confined\ngroups of undulatory robots indicating significant energetic and safety\nbenefits from group synchronization.

It is unclear how well LSST microlensing will be able to\nconstrain alternative models of DCOs with different Galactic spatial profile\ndistributions at a subdominant DM fraction. In this work, we investigate how\nwell LSST microlensing will constrain spherical or disk-like Galactic spatial\ndistributions of DCOs, taking into account extended observing times, baryonic\nmicrolensing background, and sky distribution of LSST sources. These extensions\nrepresent significant improvements over existing microlensing forecasts in\nterms of both accuracy and versatility.

To explore a more scalable way of acquiring\ncausality knowledge, in this paper, we jump out of the textual domain and\ninvestigate the possibility of learning contextual causality from the visual\nsignal. Compared with pure text-based approaches, learning causality from the\nvisual signal has the following advantages: (1) Causality knowledge belongs to\nthe commonsense knowledge, which is rarely expressed in the text but rich in\nvideos; (2) Most events in the video are naturally time-ordered, which provides\na rich resource for us to mine causality knowledge from; (3) All the objects in\nthe video can be used as context to study the contextual property of causal\nrelations. In detail, we first propose a high-quality dataset Vis-Causal and\nthen conduct experiments to demonstrate that with good language and visual\nrepresentation models as well as enough training signals, it is possible to\nautomatically discover meaningful causal knowledge from the videos. Further\nanalysis also shows that the contextual property of causal relations indeed\nexists, taking which into consideration might be crucial if we want to use the\ncausality knowledge in real applications, and the visual signal could serve as\na good resource for learning such contextual causality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Dec 2020 20:24:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-15"}

In fact, they arise from an action of the monoidal category\nof Soergel bimodules via Rouquier complexes in the usual way, the first time\n(to the author's knowledge) such an expression has been obtained for braiding\nbimodules in Heegaard Floer homology.\n  Furthermore, the singular crossing bimodule naturally factors into two\nbimodules for trivalent vertices; such bimodules have not appeared in previous\nbordered-Floer approaches to knot Floer homology. The action of the Soergel\ncategory comes from an action of categorified quantum gl(2) on the\n2-representation 2-category of U^- in line with the ideas of skew Howe duality,\nwhere the trivalent vertex bimodules are associated to 1-morphisms E, F in\ncategorified quantum gl(2).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Dec 2020 23:46:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-15"}

In addition to the challenge of\nknowledge reasoning, how to deal with the annotator bias also remains unsolved,\nwhich often leads to superficial over-fitted correlations between questions and\nanswers. To address this issue, we propose a novel dataset named\nKnowledge-Routed Visual Question Reasoning for VQA model evaluation.\nConsidering that a desirable VQA model should correctly perceive the image\ncontext, understand the question, and incorporate its learned knowledge, our\nproposed dataset aims to cutoff the shortcut learning exploited by the current\ndeep embedding models and push the research boundary of the knowledge-based\nvisual question reasoning.

The\nprograms can select one or two triplets from the scene graph or knowledge base\nto push multi-step reasoning, avoid answer ambiguity, and balanced the answer\ndistribution. In contrast to the existing VQA datasets, we further imply the\nfollowing two major constraints on the programs to incorporate knowledge\nreasoning: i) multiple knowledge triplets can be related to the question, but\nonly one knowledge relates to the image object. This can enforce the VQA model\nto correctly perceive the image instead of guessing the knowledge based on the\ngiven question solely; ii) all questions are based on different knowledge, but\nthe candidate answers are the same for both the training and test sets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2020 00:33:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-15"}

On the other hand, the properties of short\nGRBs in high-energy gamma rays are still poorly constrained, with only $\\sim$20\nevents detected in the GeV band, and none in the TeV band. GRB~160821B is one\nof the nearest short GRBs known at $z=0.162$. Recent analyses of the\nmultiwavelength observational data of its afterglow emission revealed an\noptical-infrared kilonova component, characteristic of heavy-element\nnucleosynthesis in a BNS merger. Aiming to better clarify the nature of short\nGRBs, this burst was automatically followed up with the MAGIC telescopes,\nstarting from 24 seconds after the burst trigger. Evidence of a gamma-ray\nsignal is found above $\\sim$0.5 TeV at a significance of $\\sim3\\,\\sigma$ during\nobservations that lasted until 4 hours after the burst. Assuming that the\nobserved excess events correspond to gamma-ray emission from GRB 160821B, in\nconjunction with data at other wavelengths, we investigate its origin in the\nframework of GRB afterglow models. The simplest interpretation with one-zone\nmodels of synchrotron-self-Compton emission from the external forward shock has\ndifficulty accounting for the putative TeV flux. Alternative scenarios are\ndiscussed where the TeV emission can be relatively enhanced. The role of future\nGeV-TeV observations of short GRBs in advancing our understanding of BNS\nmergers and related topics is briefly addressed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2020 00:41:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-18"}

However, such a linear\nthroughput gain is suspended in the 5G mmWave network mainly due to the short\ncommunication distances in mmWave bands and the dense deployments of mmWave\nAPs. As being operated in the interference-limited regime, the aggregate\ninterference resulted from the increasing mmWave APs will gradually become the\nnetwork performance bottleneck, which leads to the saturation of the\nthroughput. In this paper, we propose to overcome the densification plateau of\na mmWave network by employing spatial multiplexing at APs. To study the effect\nof spatial multiplexing on mmWave networks, we first derive the coverage\nprobability as a function of spatial multiplexing gain. The fixed-rate coding\nscheme is then used to provide the network throughput. We also introduce the\nconcept of densification gain to capture the improvement in network throughput\nachieved through the AP densification. Our results indicate that without the\nspatial multiplexing at APs, the throughput of mmWave networks will reach the\nplateau when the density of APs becomes sufficiently large. By enabling the\nspatial multiplexing at APs, however, the mmWave network can continuously\nharvest the throughput gains as the number of APs grows. By deriving the upper\nbound for the throughput of mmWave networks, we quantify the potential\nthroughput improvement as the spatial multiplexing gain increases. However, our\nnumerical results show that such a potential throughput gain cannot be explored\nby the fixed-rate coding scheme. We then demonstrate the necessity for\ndeploying the multi-rate coding scheme in mmWave networks, especially when the\nspatial multiplexing gain at mmWave APs is large.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2020 01:51:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-15"}

However, these variables cannot be\neffectively handled by traditional monitoring methods such as LDA, PCA and PLS.\nRecently, a mixed hidden naive Bayesian model (MHNBM) is developed for the\nfirst time to utilize both two-valued and continuous variables for abnormality\nmonitoring. Although MHNBM is effective, it still has some shortcomings that\nneed to be improved. For MHNBM, the variables with greater correlation to other\nvariables have greater weights, which cannot guarantee greater weights are\nassigned to the more discriminating variables. In addition, the conditional\nprobability must be computed based on the historical data. When the training\ndata is scarce, the conditional probability between continuous variables tends\nto be uniformly distributed, which affects the performance of MHNBM. Here a\nnovel feature weighted mixed naive Bayes model (FWMNBM) is developed to\novercome the above shortcomings. For FWMNBM, the variables that are more\ncorrelated to the class have greater weights, which makes the more\ndiscriminating variables contribute more to the model. At the same time, FWMNBM\ndoes not have to calculate the conditional probability between variables, thus\nit is less restricted by the number of training data samples. Compared with\nMHNBM, FWMNBM has better performance, and its effectiveness is validated\nthrough the numerical cases of a simulation example and a practical case of\nZhoushan thermal power plant (ZTPP), China.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2020 03:05:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Jan 2021 08:47:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2021 02:14:11 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 2022 07:30:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-26"}

We prove that SEMO with probability one does not compute\nthe full Pareto front, regardless of the runtime. In contrast, for all problem\nsizes $n$ and all jump sizes ${k \\in [4..\\frac n2 - 1]}$, the global SEMO\n(GSEMO) covers the Pareto front in an expected number of $\\Theta((n-2k)n^{k})$\niterations. For $k = o(n)$, we also show the tighter bound $\\frac 32 e n^{k+1}\n\\pm o(n^{k+1})$, which might be the first runtime bound for an MOEA that is\ntight apart from lower-order terms. We also combine the GSEMO with two\napproaches that showed advantages in single-objective multimodal problems. When\nusing the GSEMO with a heavy-tailed mutation operator, the expected runtime\nimproves by a factor of at least $k^{\\Omega(k)}$. When adapting the recent\nstagnation-detection strategy of Rajabi and Witt (2022) to the GSEMO, the\nexpected runtime also improves by a factor of at least $k^{\\Omega(k)}$ and\nsurpasses the heavy-tailed GSEMO by a small polynomial factor in $k$. Via an\nexperimental analysis, we show that these asymptotic differences are visible\nalready for small problem sizes: A factor-$5$ speed-up from heavy-tailed\nmutation and a factor-$10$ speed-up from stagnation detection can be observed\nalready for jump size~$4$ and problem sizes between $10$ and $50$.

However, the old tasks of the most previous rehearsal-based methods\nsuffer from the unpredictable domain shift when training the new task. This is\nbecause these methods always ignore two significant factors. First, the Data\nImbalance between the new task and old tasks that makes the domain of old tasks\nprone to shift. Second, the Task Isolation among all tasks will make the domain\nshift toward unpredictable directions; To address the unpredictable domain\nshift, in this paper, we propose Multi-Domain Multi-Task (MDMT) rehearsal to\ntrain the old tasks and new task parallelly and equally to break the isolation\namong tasks. Specifically, a two-level angular margin loss is proposed to\nencourage the intra-class/task compactness and inter-class/task discrepancy,\nwhich keeps the model from domain chaos.

The strong correlation\nbetween the equivalent widths of BAL and the continuum luminosity, reveals that\nthe variation of BAL trough is dominated by the photoionization.

The main idea is to\nuse CNNs to learn local appearances of vessels in image crops while using\nanother point-cloud network to learn the global geometry of vessels in the\nentire image. In inference, the proposed approach extracts local segments of\nvessels using CNNs, classifies each segment based on global geometry using the\npoint-cloud network, and finally connects all the segments that belong to the\nsame vessel using the shortest-path algorithm. This combination results in an\nefficient, fully-automatic and template-free approach to centerline extraction\nfrom 3D images. We validate the proposed approach on CTA datasets and\ndemonstrate its superior performance compared to both traditional and CNN-based\nbaselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2020 05:22:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-15"}

Strong deviations from the Arrhenius law make the\ninterpretation of the activation energy difficult. In the present study, a\nreasonable interpretation of the apparent activation energy is demonstrated\nalong similar lines as those adopted in solid-state physics and chemistry. In\ncontrast to the widely held view that phase transition in glass occurs at the\nreference temperature $T_{0}$ according to the Vogel--Fulcher--Tammann formula,\nin the present work the transition observed at the glass-transition temperature\n$T_{g}$ is regarded as a phase transition from the liquid to solid phases. A\ndistinct feature of glass is that the energy barrier significantly changes in\nthe transition range with width $\\Delta T_{g}$. This change in the energy\nbarrier alters the manner in which the apparent activation energy constitutes\nthe Arrhenius form. Analysis of available experimental data showed that the\nactual energy barrier is significantly smaller than the apparent activation\nenergy, and importantly, the values obtained were in the reasonable range of\nenergy expected for chemical bonds. The overestimation of the apparent\nactivation energy depends on the ratio $T_{g}/\\Delta T_{g}$, which explains the\nexistence of two types of glasses strong and fragile glasses. The fragility can\nbe re-interpreted as an indication of the degree of increase in the energy\nbarrier when approaching $T_{g}$ from high temperatures. Since no divergence in\nviscosity was observed below $T_{g}$, it is unlikely that a transition occurs\nat $T_{0}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2020 05:24:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-05"}

Hence, it provides an alternative to the\nconventional drift-plus-penalty (DPP) algorithm for the Lyapunov optimization.\nThe proposed DRL-based approach is applied to resource allocation in edge\ncomputing systems with queue stability and numerical results demonstrate its\nsuccessful operation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2020 05:55:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2020 11:02:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-16"}

However, most of them are\ntrained with teacher forcing with the ground truth label given at each time\nstep, without being exposed to incorrectly generated tokens during training,\nwhich hurts its generalization to unseen inputs, that is known as the \"exposure\nbias\" problem. In this work, we propose to mitigate the conditional text\ngeneration problem by contrasting positive pairs with negative pairs, such that\nthe model is exposed to various valid or incorrect perturbations of the inputs,\nfor improved generalization. However, training the model with naive contrastive\nlearning framework using random non-target sequences as negative examples is\nsuboptimal, since they are easily distinguishable from the correct output,\nespecially so with models pretrained with large text corpora. Also, generating\npositive examples requires domain-specific augmentation heuristics which may\nnot generalize over diverse domains. To tackle this problem, we propose a\nprincipled method to generate positive and negative samples for contrastive\nlearning of seq2seq models. Specifically, we generate negative examples by\nadding small perturbations to the input sequence to minimize its conditional\nlikelihood, and positive examples by adding large perturbations while enforcing\nit to have a high conditional likelihood. Such \"hard\" positive and negative\npairs generated using our method guides the model to better distinguish correct\noutputs from incorrect ones. We empirically show that our proposed method\nsignificantly improves the generalization of the seq2seq on three text\ngeneration tasks - machine translation, text summarization, and question\ngeneration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2020 06:20:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2021 05:40:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2021 05:19:38 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 2021 07:26:48 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 3 Mar 2021 08:44:34 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 2021 13:27:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-11"}

Existing works which aim to develop risk scores\neither rely on compartmental model-based reproduction numbers (which assume\nuniform population mixing) or develop coarse-grain spatial scores based on\nreproduction number (R0) and macro-level density-based mobility statistics.\nInstead, in this paper, we develop a Hawkes process-based technique to assign\nrelatively fine-grain spatial and temporal risk scores by leveraging\nhigh-resolution mobility data based on cell-phone originated location signals.\nWhile COVID-19 risk scores also depend on a number of factors specific to an\nindividual, including demography and existing medical conditions, the primary\nmode of disease transmission is via physical proximity and contact. Therefore,\nwe focus on developing risk scores based on location density and mobility\nbehaviour. We demonstrate the efficacy of the developed risk scores via\nsimulation based on real-world mobility data.

We employed the data from Hinode/SP to construct a\ntraining, validation and test dataset. The narrow-band Stokes I, Q, U, and V\nmaps at one wavelength point were selected from all the 112 wavelength points\nobserved by SP so as to simulate the single-wavelength observations of the\nfilter-based magnetograph. We used the residual network to model the nonlinear\nrelationship between the Stokes maps and the vector magnetic fields.

The proposed scheme is based on a notion of so-called pseudo-barrier\nfunctions computed for subsystems, by employing which one can synthesize hybrid\ncontrollers for interconnected systems enforcing complex specifications over a\nfinite-time horizon. Particularly, we first leverage sufficient small-gain type\nconditions to compositionally construct control barrier functions for\ninterconnected systems based on the corresponding pseudo-barrier functions\ncomputed for subsystems. Then, using the constructed control barrier functions,\nwe provide probabilistic guarantees on the satisfaction of given complex\nspecifications in a bounded time horizon. In this respect, we decompose the\ngiven complex specification to simpler reachability tasks based on automata\nrepresenting the complements of original finite-state automata. We then provide\nsystematic approaches to solve those simpler reachability tasks by computing\ncorresponding pseudo-barrier functions.

Synthesizing highly expressive facial videos from the\naudio input and static image is still a challenging task for generative\nadversarial networks. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal adaptive\nnormalization(MAN) based architecture to synthesize a talking person video of\narbitrary length using as input: an audio signal and a single image of a\nperson. The architecture uses the multi-modal adaptive normalization, keypoint\nheatmap predictor, optical flow predictor and class activation map[58] based\nlayers to learn movements of expressive facial components and hence generates a\nhighly expressive talking-head video of the given person.

A large\npart of the wind energy cost is due to the cost of maintaining the wind power\nequipment. To further reduce the maintenance cost, one can improve the design\nof the wind turbine components. One can also reduce the maintenance costs by\noptimal scheduling of the component replacements. The latter task is the main\nmotivation for this paper.\n  When a wind turbine component fails to function, it might need to be replaced\nunder less than ideal circumstances. This is known as corrective maintenance.\nTo minimize the unnecessary costs, a more active maintenance policy based on\nthe life expectancy of the key components is preferred. Optimal scheduling of\npreventive maintenance activities requires advanced mathematical modeling.\n  In this paper, an optimization model is developed using the renewal-reward\ntheorem. In the multi-component setting, our approach involves a new idea of\nvirtual maintenance which allows us to treat each replacement event as a\nrenewal event even if some components are not replaced by new ones.\n  The proposed optimization algorithm is applied to a four-component model of a\nwind turbine and the optimal maintenance plans are computed for various initial\nconditions.

A decentralized\nasynchronous algorithm is proven to converge towards this equilibrium under the\nsame conditions. Two frameworks are considered for the analysis of this game.\nOn the one hand, the game is rephrased as a Quasi-Variational Inequality (QVI).\nOn the other hand, the best response of the players is analyzed in light of the\ncontraction mappings. For this problem, the contraction approach is shown to\nlead to tighter results than the QVI one. When specializing the obtained\nresults to OFDM networks, the obtained conditions appear to significantly\noutperform state-of-the-art works, and to lead to much simpler decentralized\nalgorithms. Numerical results finally assess the obtained conditions in\ndifferent settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2020 07:51:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Jun 2021 14:59:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-18"}

In\nsome cases, the decision maker may want to examine only a few representative\nsolutions from which a final solution is selected. In other cases, a large\nnumber of non-dominated solutions may be needed to visualize the Pareto front.\nIn this paper, we suggest the use of a general EMO framework with three\nsolution sets to handle various situations with respect to the required number\nof solutions. The three solution sets are the main population of an EMO\nalgorithm, an external archive to store promising solutions, and a final\nsolution set which is presented to the decision maker.

Thus the population size and the archive size can\nbe arbitrarily specified as long as the archive size is not smaller than the\nrequired number of solutions.

One of the problems in audio captioning is the lack of\ntraining data due to the difficulty in collecting audio-caption pairs by\ncrawling the web. In this study, to overcome this problem, we propose to use a\npre-trained large-scale language model. Since an audio input cannot be directly\ninputted into such a language model, we utilize guidance captions retrieved\nfrom a training dataset based on similarities that may exist in different\naudio. Then, the caption of the audio input is generated by using a pre-trained\nlanguage model while referring to the guidance captions. Experimental results\nshow that (i) the proposed method has succeeded to use a pre-trained language\nmodel for audio captioning, and (ii) the oracle performance of the pre-trained\nmodel-based caption generator was clearly better than that of the conventional\nmethod trained from scratch.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2020 08:27:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-15"}

For practical reasons, their applications have focused on\ntransforming narrowly scoped use-cases in isolation. This has led to a\nproliferation of niche, isolated networks that are quickly becoming data and\nvalue silos. To increase value across the broader ecosystem, these networks\nmust seamlessly integrate with existing systems and interoperate with one\nanother. A fundamental requirement for enabling crosschain communication is the\nability to prove the validity of the internal state of a ledger to an external\nparty. However, due to the closed nature of permissioned ledgers, their\ninternal state is opaque to an external observer. This makes consuming and\nverifying states from these networks a non-trivial problem.\n  This paper addresses this fundamental requirement for state sharing across\npermissioned ledgers. In particular, we address two key problems for external\nclients: (i) assurances on the validity of state in a permissioned ledger and\n(ii) the ability to reason about the currency of state. We assume an\nadversarial model where the members of the committee managing the permissioned\nledger can be malicious in the absence of detectability and accountability. We\npresent a formalization of the problem for state sharing and examine its\nsecurity properties under different adversarial conditions. We propose the\ndesign of a protocol that uses a secure public ledger for providing guarantees\non safety and the ability to reason about time, with at least one honest member\nin the committee. We then provide a formal security analysis of our design and\na proof of concept implementation based on Hyperledger Fabric demonstrating the\neffectiveness of the proposed protocol.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2020 08:43:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2020 08:38:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 12 Mar 2021 11:53:05 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 10 May 2021 00:46:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-11"}

Here we explore the practical impact of kernelization (i.e. data\nreduction) on the NP-hard problem of computing the TBR distance between two\nunrooted binary phylogenetic trees. This problem is better-known in the\nliterature as the maximum agreement forest problem, where the goal is to\npartition the two trees into a minimum number of common, non-overlapping\nsubtrees. We have implemented two well-known reduction rules, the subtree and\nchain reduction, and five more recent, theoretically stronger reduction rules,\nand compare the reduction achieved with and without the stronger rules. We find\nthat the new rules yield smaller reduced instances and thus have clear\npractical added value. In many cases they also cause the TBR distance to\ndecrease in a controlled fashion. Next, we compare the achieved reduction to\nthe known worst-case theoretical bounds of 15k-9 and 11k-9 respectively, on the\nnumber of leaves of the two reduced trees, where k is the TBR distance,\nobserving in both cases a far larger reduction in practice. As a by-product of\nour experimental framework we obtain a number of new insights into the actual\ncomputation of TBR distance. We find, for example, that very strong lower\nbounds on TBR distance can be obtained efficiently by randomly sampling certain\ncarefully constructed partitions of the leaf labels, and identify instances\nwhich seem particularly challenging to solve exactly. The reduction rules have\nbeen implemented within our new solver Tubro which combines kernelization with\nan Integer Linear Programming (ILP) approach. Tubro also incorporates a number\nof additional features, such as a cluster reduction and a practical\nupper-bounding heuristic, and it can leverage combinatorial insights emerging\nfrom the proofs of correctness of the reduction rules to simplify the ILP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2020 09:09:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Oct 2021 12:21:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-06"}

The standard strategy is to\nsolve these constraints, eliminating the torsion from the classical theory,\nbefore quantization. Here we advocate leaving the torsion inside the other\nconstraints before quantization, leading at first to wave functions that can be\ncalled ``kinematical'' with regards to the torsion, but not the other\nconstraints. The torsion-free condition can then be imposed as a condition upon\nthe physical wave packets one constructs, satisfying the usual uncertainty\nrelations, and so with room for quantum fluctuations in the torsion. This\nalternative strategy has the surprising effect of clarifying the sense in which\nthe wave functions solving an explicitly real theory are ``delta-function\nnormalizable''. Such solutions with zero (or any fixed) torsion, should be\ninterpreted as plane waves in torsion space. Properly constructed wave packets\nare therefore normalizable in the standard sense. Given that they are canonical\nduals, this statement applies equally well to the Chern-Simons state\n(connection representation) and the Hartle-Hawking wave function (metric\nrepresentation). We show how, when torsion is taken into account, the\nHartle-Hawking wave function is replaced by a Gauss-Airy function, with finite\nnorm, which we call the Hartle-Hawking beam. The Chern-Simons state, instead,\nbecomes a packet with a Gaussian probability distribution in connection space.\nWe conclude the paper with two sections explaining how to generalize these\nresults beyond minisuperspace.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2020 09:18:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-12"}

In the present work,\nwe are probing possible roles of one such important forces, known as\n``blackbody friction force (BBFF)'', that may affect the precisions in the\nmeasurements made using atom interferometers based on the Rb and Cs atoms. The\nBBFF can be generated on atoms due to the black-body radiations emitted by the\nstray electromagnetic fields present in the experimental set-up and other\nmetallic shielding. The strength of the BBFF can be calculated by integrating\nthe complex parts of the dynamic polarizabilities of atoms, which show varying\nbehaviour at the resonant and non-resonant transitions in the above atoms. Our\nanalyses suggest that the off-resonant atomic transitions make significant\ncontributions to the BBFF at low temperatures in the Rb and Cs atom\ninterferometers.

The analysis of these data, whose angular resolution allows\nthe study of the induced effects of the perturbation down to the scale of\nindividual HII regions, also suggests that the increase of the star formation\nactivity is due to the compression of the gas along the stellar disc of the\ngalaxy, which is able to increase its mean electron density and boost the star\nformation process producing bright HII regions. The hydrodynamic interaction\nhas deeply perturbed the velocity field of the ionised gas component while\nleaving unaffected that of the stellar disc. The comparison of the data with\nhydrodynamic simulations accounting for the different gas phases (atomic,\nmolecular, ionised) consistently indicates that the perturbing event is very\nrecent, once again confirming that ram pressure stripping is a violent\nphenomenon able to perturb on short timescales the evolution of galaxies in\nrich environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2020 09:55:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-15"}

In this\ndiscussion paper it is argued that this reasoning to reject the aether is\nunfounded since the Lorentz factor also appears as an increased resistance term\nin fluid dynamics when the speed of sound is approached. This means that, for\nexample, particle accelerator tests of the Lorentz factor can be interpreted as\na form of detection of a fluidic aether. Furthermore, it is shown that the\nmass-energy equivalence is identical to the energy for compression of a fluid\nwith the speed of sound equal to the speed of light. It is thus possible that\nthe aether not only exists but that it also is the matter all particles are\nmade of.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2020 10:30:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-15"}

We consider whether keyword localisation is possible using two forms\nof weak supervision where location information is not provided explicitly. In\nthe first, only the presence or absence of a word is indicated, i.e. a\nbag-of-words (BoW) labelling. In the second, visual context is provided in the\nform of an image paired with an unlabelled utterance; a model then needs to be\ntrained in a self-supervised fashion using the paired data. For keyword\nlocalisation, we adapt a saliency-based method typically used in the vision\ndomain. We compare this to an existing technique that performs localisation as\na part of the network architecture. While the saliency-based method is more\nflexible (it can be applied without architectural restrictions), we identify a\ncritical limitation when using it for keyword localisation. Of the two forms of\nsupervision, the visually trained model performs worse than the BoW-trained\nmodel. We show qualitatively that the visually trained model sometimes locate\nsemantically related words, but this is not consistent.

This shielding effect\narises primarily due to ring currents in the carbon structure in the presence\nof a magnetic field, such that the observed chemical shift differences upon\nadsorption are nucleus-independent to a first approximation. Theoretical\nmodelling has played an important role in rationalising and explaining these\nexperimental observations. Together, experiments and simulations have enabled a\nlarge amount of information to be gained on the adsorption and diffusion of\nadsorbed species, as well as on the structural and magnetic properties of the\nporous carbon adsorbent. Here, we review the methodological developments and\napplications of NMR spectroscopy and related modelling in this field, and\nprovide perspectives on possible future applications and research directions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2020 11:04:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-15"}

Here we compute a grid of\nstellar evolution models using the Geneva code with the aim to improve our\nunderstanding of the evolution of zero-metallicity stars, with particular\ninterest in how rotation affects surface properties, interior structure, and\nmetal enrichment. We produce a range of models of initial masses (Mini) from\n1.7 Msun to 120 Msun, focusing on massive models of 9 Msun < Mini < 120 Msun.\nOur grid includes models with and without rotation, with rotating models having\nan initial velocity of 40% of the critical velocity. We find that rotation\nstrongly impacts the evolution of the first stars, mainly through increased\ncore size and stronger H-burning shells during core He-burning. Without\nradiative mass loss, angular momentum builds at the surface in rotating models,\nthus models of initial masses Mini > 60 Msun reach critical rotation on the\nmain sequence and experience mass loss. We find that rotational mixing strongly\naffects metal enrichment, but does not always increase metal production as we\nsee at higher metallicities. This is because rotation leads to an earlier CNO\nboost to the H shell during He-burning, which may hinder metal enrichment\ndepending on initial mass and rotational velocity.

In this paper we establish a general relation\nbetween chain complexes and continual Lie algebras. First, by defining and\nappropriate product among a chain complex spaces we endow it with the structure\nof an exterior differential graded algebra $\\mathcal C$. The natural\northogonality condition with respect to a product bring about to $\\mathcal C$\nthe structure of a graded algebra with differential relations and compatibility\nconditions for elements of chain complex spaces. By considering the union of\nall relations for independent elements in the tree graph structure of the\nsystem, we prove the main result of this paper: a chain complex brings about\nthe structure of a continual Lie algebra with the root space determined by\nparameters for the complex. This provides a new source of examples of continual\nLie algebras. Finally, as an example, we consider the case of \\v{C}ech-de Rham\ncomplex associated to a foliation on a smooth manifold. In a particular case of\nthis chain complex, we derive explicitly the commutation relations for\ncorresponding continual Lie algebra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2020 11:35:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-15"}

In these attacks, we infer the internal\nstate of the prandom PRNG from one OSI layer, and use it to either predict the\nvalues of the PRNG employed by the other OSI layer, or to correlate it to an\ninternal state of the PRNG inferred from the other protocol.\n  Using this approach we can mount a very efficient DNS cache poisoning attack\nagainst Linux.

Recent studies have shown the potential of\nTransformer to increase the prediction capacity. However, there are several\nsevere issues with Transformer that prevent it from being directly applicable\nto LSTF, including quadratic time complexity, high memory usage, and inherent\nlimitation of the encoder-decoder architecture. To address these issues, we\ndesign an efficient transformer-based model for LSTF, named Informer, with\nthree distinctive characteristics: (i) a $ProbSparse$ self-attention mechanism,\nwhich achieves $O(L \\log L)$ in time complexity and memory usage, and has\ncomparable performance on sequences' dependency alignment. (ii) the\nself-attention distilling highlights dominating attention by halving cascading\nlayer input, and efficiently handles extreme long input sequences. (iii) the\ngenerative style decoder, while conceptually simple, predicts the long\ntime-series sequences at one forward operation rather than a step-by-step way,\nwhich drastically improves the inference speed of long-sequence predictions.\nExtensive experiments on four large-scale datasets demonstrate that Informer\nsignificantly outperforms existing methods and provides a new solution to the\nLSTF problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2020 11:43:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2020 03:05:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 28 Mar 2021 14:45:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-30"}

Here we focus on a specific science case, namely\nthe complex circumbinary environments of a subset of evolved binaries, for\nwhich interferometric imaging provides the spatial resolution required to\nresolve the immediate circumbinary environment.\n  Indeed, many binaries where the main star is in the post-asymptotic giant\nbranch (post-AGB) phase are surrounded by circumbinary disks. Those disks were\nfirst inferred from the infrared excess produced by dust. Snapshot\ninterferometric observations in the infrared confirmed disk-like morphology and\nrevealed high spatial complexity of the emission that the use of geometrical\nmodels could not recover without being strongly biased. Arguably, the most\nconvincing proof of the disk-like shape of the circumbinary environment came\nfrom the first interferometric image of such a system (IRAS08544-4431) using\nthe PIONIER instrument at the VLTI. This image was obtained using the SPARCO\nimage reconstruction approach that enables to subtract a model of a component\nof the image and reconstruct an image of its environment only. In the case of\nIRAS08544-4431, the model involved a binary and the image of the remaining\nsignal revealed several unexpected features. Then, a second image revealed a\ndifferent but also complex circumstellar morphology around HD101584 that was\nwell studied by ALMA. To exploit the VLTI imaging capability to understand\nthese targets, we started a large program at the VLTI to image post-AGB binary\nsystems using both PIONIER and GRAVITY instruments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2020 12:03:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-15"}

The\ndesign flexibility comes, however, with the complexity of the underlying\nphysics. In fact, metal additive manufacturing introduces process-induced\ngeometrical defects that mainly result in deviations of the effective geometry\nfrom the nominal one. This change in the final printed shape is the primary\ncause of the gap between the as-designed and as-manufactured mechanical\nbehavior of AM products. Thus, the possibility to incorporate the precise\nmanufactured geometries into the computational analysis is crucial for the\nquality and performance assessment of the final parts. Computed tomography (CT)\nis an accurate method for the acquisition of the manufactured shape. However,\nit is often not feasible to integrate the CT-based geometrical information into\nthe traditional computational analysis due to the complexity of the meshing\nprocedure for such high-resolution geometrical models and the prohibitive\nnumerical costs.

We combine observations from the\nAtmospheric Imaging Assembly and the Helioseismic Magnetic Imager on board the\nSolar Dynamics Observatory to investigate homologous flaring activity over a\nsmall sunspot light bridge in an emerging flux region.

A non-linear force free extrapolation of the photospheric magnetic\nfield shows a low-lying flux rope connecting the light bridge to a remote\nopposite-polarity network. The persistent flares occur as a result of the rapid\nhorizontal motion of the leading sunspot that causes the relatively vertical\nmagnetic fields in the adjacent umbra to reconnect with the low-lying flux rope\nin the light bridge.

This CME presents a good opportunity for a\ntriple radial alignment study, as the spacecraft were separated by less than\n5$^\\circ$ in longitude.

We propose diff\npruning as a simple approach to enable parameter-efficient transfer learning\nwithin the pretrain-finetune framework. This approach views finetuning as\nlearning a task-specific diff vector that is applied on top of the pretrained\nparameter vector, which remains fixed and is shared across different tasks. The\ndiff vector is adaptively pruned during training with a differentiable\napproximation to the L0-norm penalty to encourage sparsity. Diff pruning\nbecomes parameter-efficient as the number of tasks increases, as it requires\nstoring only the nonzero positions and weights of the diff vector for each\ntask, while the cost of storing the shared pretrained model remains constant.\nIt further does not require access to all tasks during training, which makes it\nattractive in settings where tasks arrive in stream or the set of tasks is\nunknown.

In more demanding situations involving distant\nmicrophones, overlapped speech, background noise, or natural dialogue\nstructures, the ASR error rate is at least an order of magnitude higher. The\nvisual modality of speech carries the potential to partially overcome these\nchallenges and contribute to the sub-tasks of speaker diarisation, voice\nactivity detection, and the recovery of the place of articulation, and can\ncompensate for up to 15dB of noise on average. This article develops AV Taris,\na fully differentiable neural network model capable of decoding audio-visual\nspeech in real time. We achieve this by connecting two recently proposed models\nfor audio-visual speech integration and online speech recognition, namely AV\nAlign and Taris. We evaluate AV Taris under the same conditions as AV Align and\nTaris on one of the largest publicly available audio-visual speech datasets,\nLRS2. Our results show that AV Taris is superior to the audio-only variant of\nTaris, demonstrating the utility of the visual modality to speech recognition\nwithin the real time decoding framework defined by Taris. Compared to an\nequivalent Transformer-based AV Align model that takes advantage of full\nsentences without meeting the real-time requirement, we report an absolute\ndegradation of approximately 3% with AV Taris. As opposed to the more popular\nalternative for online speech recognition, namely the RNN Transducer, Taris\noffers a greatly simplified fully differentiable training pipeline. As a\nconsequence, AV Taris has the potential to popularise the adoption of\nAudio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) technology and overcome the inherent\nlimitations of the audio modality in less optimal listening conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2020 12:39:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-15"}

Although asynchronous access reduces\nthe energy consumption of IoT devices, the network performance suffers from\nhigh intra-network interference in dense deployments. Contrarily, synchronous\naccess can improve throughput and fairness, but it requires time\nsynchronization. Unfortunately, maintaining synchronization over the narrowband\nLPWANs wastes channel time and transmission opportunities. In this paper, we\npropose the use of out-of-band time-dissemination to relatively synchronize\nLoRa devices and thereby facilitate resource-efficient slotted uplink\ncommunication. To this end, we conceptualize and analyze a co-designed\nsynchronization and random access mechanism that can effectively exploit\ntechnologies providing limited time accuracy, such as FM radio data system\n(FM-RDS). While considering the LoRa-specific parameters, we derive the\nthroughput of the proposed mechanism, compare it to a generic synchronous\nrandom access using in-band synchronization, and design the communication\nparameters under time uncertainty. We scrutinize the transmission time\nuncertainty of a device by introducing a clock error model that accounts for\nthe errors in the synchronization source, local clock, propagation delay, and\ntransceiver's transmission time uncertainty. We characterize the time\nuncertainty of FM-RDS with hardware measurements and perform simulations to\nevaluate the proposed solution. The results, presented in terms of success\nprobability, throughput, and fairness for a single-cell scenario, suggest that\nFM-RDS, despite its poor absolute synchronization, can be used effectively to\nrealize slotted LoRa communication with performance similar to that of more\naccurate time-dissemination technologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2020 12:58:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-20"}

Sparsity is an important feature to ensure\nrobustness against noisy data, but also to find models that are interpretable\nand easy to analyze due to the small number of relevant terms. It is common\npractice to enforce sparsity by adding the $\\ell_1$-norm as a weighted penalty\nterm. In order to gain a better understanding and to allow for an informed\nmodel selection, we directly solve the corresponding multiobjective\noptimization problem (MOP) that arises when we minimize the main objective and\nthe $\\ell_1$-norm simultaneously.

It extends von Neumann's alternating projection\nfor finding a point in the intersection of two linear subspaces, Bregman's\nmethod for finding a common point of convex sets and the Kaczmarz method for\nsolving systems of linear equations to the more general case of multiple\nnonlinear and nonconvex sets. The existing convergence analyses on randomized\nKaczmarz are merely applicable to linear case. There are no theoretical\nconvergence results of the SP for solving nonlinear equations.

Simple,\nrobust, narrowband modulation schemes permit the implementation of low-cost\nradio devices offering high receiver sensitivity, thus improving the overall\nlink budget. The several technologies belonging to the LPWAN family, including\nthe well-known LoRaWAN solution, provide a cost-effective answer to many\nInternet-of-things (IoT) applications, requiring wireless communication capable\nof supporting large networks of many devices (e.g., smart metering). Generally,\nthe adopted MAC strategy is based on pure ALOHA, which, among other things,\nallows to minimize the traffic overhead under constrained duty cycle\nlimitations of the unlicensed bands. Unfortunately, ALOHA suffers from poor\nscalability, rapidly collapsing in dense networks. This work investigates the\ndesign of an improved LoRaWAN MAC scheme based on slotted ALOHA. In particular,\nthe required time dissemination is provided by out-of-band communications\nleveraging on FM-RDS broadcasting. An experimental setup based on low-cost\nhardware is used to characterize the obtainable synchronization performance and\nderive a timing error model. Consequently, improvements in success probability\nand energy efficiency have been validated by means of simulations in very large\nnetworks with up to 10000 nodes. It is shown that the advantage of the proposed\nscheme over conventional LoRaWAN communication is up to 100% when short update\ntime and large payload are required. Similar results are obtained regarding the\nenergy efficiency improvement, which is close to 100% for relatively short\ntransmission intervals and long message duration; however, due to the\nadditional overhead for listening to the time dissemination messages,\nefficiency gain can be negative for short-duration messages fastly repeating.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2020 14:34:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-20"}

This might lead to\nnew avenues to fully control topologically protected transport.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2020 14:38:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-10"}

Seasonal forcing is predominantly modelled as a sine\nwave but the transition between seasons is often more sudden. Some studies\nmentioned the robustness of their results to the shape of the forcing signal,\nwithout detailed analyses. Therefore, whether and how the shape of seasonal\nforcing affects the dynamics of coupled dynamical systems remains unclear,\nwhile abrupt seasonal transitions are widespread in ecological systems. To\nprovide some answers, we conduct a numerical analysis of the dynamical response\nof predator--prey communities to the shape of the forcing signal by exploring\nthe joint effect of two features of seasonal forcing: the magnitude of the\nsignal, which is classically the only one studied, and the shape of the signal,\nabrupt or sinusoidal. We consider both linear and saturating functional\nresponses, and focus on seasonal forcing of the predator's discovery rate,\nwhich fluctuates with changing environmental conditions and prey's ability to\nescape predation. Our numerical results highlight that a more abrupt seasonal\nforcing mostly alters the magnitude of population fluctuations and triggers\nperiod--doubling bifurcations, as well as the emergence of chaos, at lower\nforcing strength than for sine waves. Controlling the variance of the forcing\nsignal mitigates this trend but does not fully suppress it, which suggests that\nthe variance is not the only feature of the shape of seasonal forcing that acts\non community dynamics. Although theoretical studies may predict correctly the\nsequence of bifurcations using sine waves as a representation of seasonality,\nthere is a rationale for applied studies to implement as realistic seasonal\nforcing as possible to make precise predictions of community dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2020 14:58:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-15"}

Current removal methods normally leverage image-to-image\ntranslation techniques. Nevertheless, the uncertainty of the size, shape, color\nand transparency of the watermarks set a huge barrier for these methods. To\ncombat this, we combine traditional watermarked image decomposition into a\ntwo-stage generator, called Watermark-Decomposition Network (WDNet), where the\nfirst stage predicts a rough decomposition from the whole watermarked image and\nthe second stage specifically centers on the watermarked area to refine the\nremoval results.

In this paper, we revisit re-ranking and demonstrate\nthat re-ranking can be reformulated as a high-parallelism Graph Neural Network\n(GNN) function.

We suggest a simple model of\nthe $pp$ elastic scattering with two types of particle exchanges: 1) when the\nexchanged particle transfers the momentum $\\veQ$ from a quark of the proton\n$p_1$ to one quark in another proton $p_2$, producing the slope $B_1$; 2) when\nthe transfer occurs from two quarks in the $p_1$ to two quarks in the $p_2$,\ngiving the exponent with the slope $B_2$. The resulting amplitude is\nproportional to the product of the form factors of two protons, depending on\n$\\veQ$, but with different coefficients in the cases 1) and 2). Using the only\nparameter - the proton charge radius $r^2_{ch}= 0.93$~fm$^2$, one obtains $B_1\n= 16$~GeV$^{-2}$,~$ B_2 = 4$~GeV$^{-2}$ with the strict value of the ratio,\n$\\frac{B_1}{B_2} = 4.0$, independent of $r_{ch}$.

A fundamental\nchallenge in the design of load balancing algorithms is to achieve an optimal\ntrade-off between delay performance and implementation overhead (e.g.\ncommunication or memory usage). This trade-off has primarily been studied so\nfar from the angle of the amount of overhead required to achieve asymptotically\noptimal performance, particularly vanishing delay in large-scale systems. In\ncontrast, in the present paper, we focus on an arbitrarily sparse communication\nbudget, possibly well below the minimum requirement for vanishing delay,\nreferred to as the hyper-scalable operating region. Furthermore, jobs may only\nbe admitted when a specific limit on the queue position of the job can be\nguaranteed.\n  The centerpiece of our analysis is a universal upper bound for the achievable\nthroughput of any dispatcher-driven algorithm for a given communication budget\nand queue limit. We also propose a specific hyper-scalable scheme which can\noperate at any given message rate and enforce any given queue limit, while\nallowing the server states to be captured via a closed product-form network, in\nwhich servers act as customers traversing various nodes. The product-form\ndistribution is leveraged to prove that the bound is tight and that the\nproposed hyper-scalable scheme is throughput-optimal in a many-server regime\ngiven the communication and queue limit constraints. Extensive simulation\nexperiments are conducted to illustrate the results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2020 12:43:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-16"}

SCI devices include two\nmain parts: a hardware encoder and a software decoder. The hardware encoder\ntypically consists of an (optical) imaging system designed to capture\n{compressed measurements}. The software decoder on the other hand refers to a\nreconstruction algorithm that retrieves the desired high-dimensional signal\nfrom those measurements. In this paper, using deep unfolding ideas, we propose\nan SCI recovery algorithm, namely GAP-net, which unfolds the generalized\nalternating projection (GAP) algorithm. At each stage, GAP-net passes its\ncurrent estimate of the desired signal through a trained convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN). The CNN operates as a denoiser that projects the estimate back\nto the desired signal space. For the GAP-net that employs trained\nauto-encoder-based denoisers, we prove a probabilistic global convergence\nresult. Finally, we investigate the performance of GAP-net in solving video SCI\nand spectral SCI problems. In both cases, GAP-net demonstrates competitive\nperformance on both synthetic and real data. In addition to having high\naccuracy and high speed, we show that GAP-net is flexible with respect to\nsignal modulation implying that a trained GAP-net decoder can be applied in\ndifferent systems.

The\neffect of the initial particle shape is discussed by comparing packings of\npentagons with packings of soft circular particles. We characterize the\nevolution of the packing fraction, the elastic modulus, and the microstructure\n(particle rearrangement, connectivity, contact force and particle stress\ndistributions) as a function of the applied stresses. Both systems behave\nsimilarly; the packing fraction increases and tends asymptotically to a maximum\nvalue $\\phi_{max}$, where the bulk modulus diverges. At the microscopic scale\nwe show that particle rearrangements occur even beyond the jammed state, the\nmean coordination increases as a square root of the packing fraction and, the\nforce and stress distributions become more homogeneous as the packing fraction\nincreases. Soft pentagons present larger particle rearrangements than circular\nones, and such behavior decreases proportionally to the friction.\nInterestingly, the friction between particles also contributes to a better\nhomogenization of the contact force network in both systems. From the\nexpression of the granular stress tensor, we develop a model that describes the\ncompaction behavior as a function of the applied pressure, the Young modulus\nand the initial shape of the particles. This model, settled on the joint\nevolution of the particle connectivity and the contact stress, provides\noutstanding predictions from the jamming point up to very high densities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Dec 2020 19:43:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-16"}
