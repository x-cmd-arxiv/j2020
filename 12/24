Thus, this paper exploits intelligent reflecting\nsurface (IRS) to enhance anti-jamming communication performance and mitigate\njamming interference by adjusting the surface reflecting elements at the IRS.\nAiming to enhance the communication performance against smart jammer, an\noptimization problem for jointly optimizing power allocation at the base\nstation (BS) and reflecting beamforming at the IRS is formulated. As the\njamming model and jamming behavior are dynamic and unknown, a win or learn fast\npolicy hill-climbing (WoLF-PHC) learning approach is proposed to jointly\noptimize the anti-jamming power allocation and reflecting beamforming strategy\nwithout the knowledge of the jamming model.

We revisit the conventional mechanism of coalescence of\nprimarily generated and back-scattered Langmuir waves in quasihomogeneous\nplasma. Additionally, we propose and investigate another mechanism that\ngenerates the harmonic emission only in a strongly inhomogeneous plasma: the\nnonlinear coupling of incident and reflected Langmuir waves inside localized\nregions with enhanced plasma density (clumps), in the close vicinity of the\nreflection point. Both mechanisms imply the presence of strong density\nfluctuations in plasma. We use the results of a probabilistic model of\nbeam-plasma interaction and evaluate the efficiency of energy transfer from\nLangmuir waves to harmonic emission. We infer that harmonic emissions from a\nquasihomogeneous plasma are significantly more intense than found in previous\nstudies. The efficiency of Langmuir waves conversion into electromagnetic\nharmonic emission is expected to be higher at large heliospheric distances for\nthe mechanism operating in quasihomogeneous plasma, and at small heliocentric\ndistances - for the one operating in inhomogeneous. The evaluation of emission\nintensity in quasihomogeneous plasma may also be applied for type II solar\nradio bursts.

However, it is significantly more challenging to construct optimal\npreconditioners for them compared to diagonally implicit RK (or DIRK) schemes.\nTo address this challenge, we first introduce mathematically optimal\npreconditioners called block complex Schur decomposition (BCSD), block real\nSchur decomposition (BRSD), and block Jordan form (BJF), motivated by\nblock-circulant preconditioners and Jordan form solution techniques for IRK. We\nthen derive an efficient, near-optimal singly-diagonal approximate BRSD\n(SABRSD) by approximating the quasi-triangular matrix in real Schur\ndecomposition using an optimized upper-triangular matrix with a single diagonal\nvalue. A desirable feature of SABRSD is that it has comparable memory\nrequirements and factorization (or setup) cost as singly DIRK (SDIRK). We\napproximate the diagonal blocks in these preconditioning techniques using an\nincomplete factorization with (near) linear complexity, such as multilevel ILU,\nILU(0), or a multigrid method with an ILU-based smoother. We apply the block\npreconditioners in right-preconditioned GMRES to solve the advection-diffusion\nequation in 3D using finite element and finite difference methods. We show that\nBCSD, BRSD, and BJF significantly outperform other preconditioners in terms of\nGMRES iterations, and SABRSD is competitive with them and the prior state of\nthe art in terms of computational cost while requiring the least amount of\nmemory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2020 16:35:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 13 Jun 2021 18:54:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-13"}

Even\nmore recently, the intermittent plastic response was found to be generic for\nmicro- and nano-sized systems independently of their crystallographic symmetry.\nThese rather remarkable discoveries are reviewed in this paper in the\nperspective of the recent studies performed in our group. We discuss the\nphysical origin and the scaling properties of plastic fluctuations and address\nthe nature of their dependence on crystalline symmetry, system size, and\ndisorder content. A particular emphasis is placed on the associated emergent\nbehaviors, including the formation of dislocation structures, and on our\nability to temper plastic fluctuations by alloying. We also discuss the\n\"smaller is wilder\" size effect that culminates in a paradoxical crack-free\nbrittle behavior of very small, initially dislocation free crystals. We show\nthat the implied transition between different rheological behaviors is\nregulated by the ratio of length scales $R=L/l$, where $L$ is the system size\nand $l$ is the internal length. We link this new size effect with other related\nphenomena like size dependence of strength (\"smaller is stronger\") and the size\ninduced switch between different hardening mechanisms. One of the technological\nchallenges in nanoscience is to tame the intermittency of plastic flow. We show\nthat this task can be accomplished by generating tailored quenched disorder\nwhich allows one to control micro- and nano-scale forming and opens new\nperspectives in micro-metallurgy and structural engineering of ultra-small\nload-carrying elements.

But since CNNs\nwere originally developed for image classification, appearance modeling\nprovided by their deep layers might be not enough discriminative for the\ntracking task. In fact,such features represent high-level information, that is\nmore related to object category than to a specific instance of the object.\nMotivated by this observation, and by the fact that discriminative correlation\nfilters(DCFs) may provide a complimentary low-level information, we presenta\nnovel tracking algorithm taking advantage of both approaches. We formulate the\ntracking task as a two-stage procedure. First, we exploit the generalization\nability of deep features to coarsely estimate target translation, while\nensuring invariance to appearance change. Then, we capitalize on the\ndiscriminative power of correlation filters to precisely localize the tracked\nobject. Furthermore, we designed an update control mechanism to learn\nappearance change while avoiding model drift. We evaluated the proposed tracker\non object tracking benchmarks.

Traditionally, the independent system\noperators (ISOs) leveraged DC Optimal Power Flow (DCOPF) problem formulation to\nsettle the electricity market. The main quest of this work is to find what\nwould be the challenges and opportunities if ISOs leverage the full ACOPF as\nthe market-clearing Problem (MCP)? This paper presents tractable mathematical\nprogramming with equilibrium constraints for the convexified AC market-clearing\nproblem. Market participants maximize their profit via strategic bidding while\nconsidering the reactive power dispatch of generation units. The equilibrium\nconstraints are procured by presenting the dual form of the relaxed ACOPF\nproblem. The strategic bidding problem with ACOPF-based MCP improves the\nexactness of the location marginal prices (LMPs) and profit of market\nparticipants compared to the one with DCOPF. It is shown that the strategic\nbidding problem with DCOFP-based MCP is unable to model the limitations of\nreactive power support. The presented results display cases where the proposed\nstrategic bidding method renders $52.3\\%$ more profit for the Generation\nCompany (GENCO) than the DCOPF-based MCP model. The proposed strategic bidding\nframework also addresses the challenges in coupling real and reactive power\ndispatch of generation constraints, ramping constraints, demand response\nimplications with curtailable and time shiftable loads, and AC line flow\nconstraints. Therefore, the presented method will help market participants\nleverage the more accurate ACOPF model in the strategic bidding problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2020 16:49:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 May 2021 18:20:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 28 Feb 2022 21:16:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-25"}

Herein we report\ntime-domain THz spectroscopy measurements of several different high-quality\nmetallic ruthenate thin films and show that the optical conductivity can be\ninterpreted in more conventional terms. In all materials, the conductivity has\na two-Drude peak lineshape at low temperature and a crossover to a one-Drude\npeak lineshape at higher temperatures. The two-component low-temperature\nconductivity is indicative of two well-separated current relaxation rates for\ndifferent conduction channels. We discuss three particular possibilities for\nthe separation of rates: (a) Strongly energy-dependent inelastic scattering;\n(b) an almost-conserved pseudomomentum operator that overlaps with the current,\ngiving rise to the narrower Drude peak; (c) the presence of multiple conduction\nchannels that undergoes a crossover to stronger interband scattering at higher\ntemperatures. None of these scenarios require the existence of exotic\nquasiparticles. The results may give insight into the possible significance of\nHund's coupling in determining interband coupling in these materials. Our\nresults also show a route towards understanding the violation of Matthiessen's\nrule in this class of materials and deviations from the \"Gurzhi\" scaling\nrelations in Fermi liquids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2020 16:59:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-12"}

To\nfurther improve specificity of DWI in the breast, stronger and faster diffusion\nweighting is advantageous. With the target application in mind, the gradient\ncoil is designed on an irregularly shaped semi-open current-carrying surface.\nDue to the coil former closely fitting the non-spherical target region,\nnon-linear encoding fields become particularly advantageous for achieving\nlocally exceptionally high gradient strengths. As the breast tissue has a\npredominantly isotropic cellular microstructure, the direction of the\ndiffusion-weighting gradient may be allowed to vary within the target volume.\nHowever, due to the quadratic dependency of the b-factor on the gradient\nstrength, variation of the gradient magnitude needs to be carefully controlled.\n  To achieve the above design goals the corresponding multi-objective\noptimization problem is reformulated as a constrained optimization, allowing\nfor flexible and precise control of the coil properties.

It is demonstrated here how to couple two edge plasmons\nwith a waveguide mode to form a hybrid waveguide well tuned for applications in\nthe field of electro-optical transistors (modulators). A mixed polarization\nstate of edge plasmons allows them to couple with a horizontally polarized (TE)\noptical mode (which is not possible for usual surface plasmons) and open the\nway to polarization independent plasmonic modulators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2020 17:25:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-24"}

Both\nsimulations maintain the filamentary structure during the collapse, developing\na hierarchical accretion flow from the cloud to the plane; from there to the\nfilament, and from the filament to the core. The flow changes direction\nsmoothly at every step of the hierarchy, with no density divergence nor a shock\ndeveloping at the filament's axis during the studied prestellar evolution. The\nflow drives accretion onto the central core and drains material from the\nfilament, slowing down the growth of the latter. As a consequence, the ratio of\nthe central density of the core to the filament density increases in time,\ndiverging at the time of singularity formation in the core. The stratified\nsimulation produces the best match for observed Plummer-like radial column\ndensity profiles of filaments, while the uniform simulation does not produce a\nflat central density profile. This result supports recent suggestions that MCs\nmay be preferentially flattened structures. We examine the possibility that the\nfilamentary flow might approach a quasi-stationary regime in which the radial\naccretion onto the filament is balanced by the longitudinal accretion onto the\ncore. A simple argument suggests that such a stationary state may be an\nattractor for the system. Our simulations, do not attain this stationary stage,\nbut appear to be approaching it during the prestellar stage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2020 17:28:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Jan 2022 10:07:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-12"}

Being able\nto obtain morphometric quantification (size, location, growth rate) of the\ntumor, edema, and cavity can result in improved monitoring and treatment\nplanning. Such quantification requires the segmentation of these structures\ninto three separate classes. However, manual segmentation of 3-dimensional\nstructures is time-consuming and tedious, motivating the development of\nautomated methods. Here, we tailor a model adapted to the spinal cord tumor\nsegmentation task. Data were obtained from 343 patients using\ngadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted and T2-weighted MRI scans with cervical,\nthoracic, and/or lumbar coverage. The dataset includes the three most common\nintramedullary spinal cord tumor types: astrocytomas, ependymomas, and\nhemangioblastomas. The proposed approach is a cascaded architecture with\nU-Net-based models that segments tumors in a two-stage process: locate and\nlabel. The model first finds the spinal cord and generates bounding box\ncoordinates. The images are cropped according to this output, leading to a\nreduced field of view, which mitigates class imbalance. The tumor is then\nsegmented. The segmentation of the tumor, cavity, and edema (as a single class)\nreached 76.7 $\\pm$ 1.5% of Dice score and the segmentation of tumors alone\nreached 61.8 $\\pm$ 4.0% Dice score. The true positive detection rate was above\n87% for tumor, edema, and cavity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst fully automatic deep learning model for spinal cord tumor segmentation.\nThe multiclass segmentation pipeline is available in the Spinal Cord Toolbox\n(https://spinalcordtoolbox.com/). It can be run with custom data on a regular\ncomputer within seconds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2020 17:31:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 2021 17:01:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 8 Mar 2021 05:25:53 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 30 Mar 2021 13:32:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-31"}

Most of the observed sources present the morphologies\nof a thermal core, hosting the protostar and exhibiting no proper motion, and\nassociated non-thermal radio lobes that are characterised by proper motions and\nlocated away from the thermal core. Some of the protostars drive jets whose\nlobes have dissimilar displacement vectors, implying precession of the jets or\nthe presence of multiple jet drivers.

Cohorting allows us to: ($i$) form\ntraveler bubbles, thereby decreasing the number of distinct interactions over\ntime; ($ii$) potentially quarantine an entire cohort if a single case is\ndetected, making contact tracing more efficient, and ($iii$) target cohorts for\ntesting and early detection of symptomatic as well as asymptomatic cases.\nStudying impact of cohorts using compartmental models is challenging because of\nthe ensuing representational complexity. Agent-based models provide a natural\nway to represent cohorts along with the representation of the cohort members\nwith the larger social network. This paper describes a novel multi-scale\nagent-based model to study the impact of cohorting strategies on COVID-19\ndynamics in Mumbai. We achieve this by modeling the Mumbai urban region using a\ndetailed agent-based model comprising of 12.4 million agents.

The resulting multi-scale model\nin conjunction with a detailed disease transmission and intervention simulator\nis used to assess various cohorting strategies.

The results show that cohorts can provide significant benefit\nin terms of reduced transmission without significantly impacting ridership and\nor economic \\& social activity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2020 18:06:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Dec 2020 08:20:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-25"}

In blind assessments using\nsimulated heterogeneous cryo-EM datasets, AlphaCryo4D achieved 3D\nclassification accuracy three times that of conventional method and\nreconstructed continuous conformational changes of a 130-kDa protein at\nsub-3-angstrom resolution. By using AlphaCryo4D to analyze a single\nexperimental cryo-EM dataset, we identified 64 conformers of the\nsubstrate-bound human 26S proteasome, revealing conformational entanglement of\ntwo regulatory particles in the doubly capped holoenzymes and their energetic\ndifferences with singly capped ones. Novel ubiquitin-binding sites are\ndiscovered on the RPN2, RPN10 and Alpha5 subunits to remodel polyubiquitin\nchains for deubiquitylation and recycle. Importantly, AlphaCryo4D choreographs\nsingle-nucleotide-exchange dynamics of proteasomal AAA-ATPase motor during\ntranslocation initiation, which upregulates proteolytic activity by\nallosterically promoting nucleophilic attack. Our systemic analysis illuminates\na grand hierarchical allostery for proteasome autoregulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2020 18:23:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 13 Jun 2021 06:34:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-15"}

The recent emergence of non-volatile memory (NVM) technologies\nincreases the interest in the development of persistent concurrent objects.\nThese are objects that are able to recover from system failures and ensure\nconsistency by retaining their state in NVM and fixing it, if required, upon\nrecovery.

Such states are sensitive to decoherence\nfrom their environment. Recently, in Ref. [1] we computed the rate of\ndecoherence of a piece of superposed matter that primarily only interacts\ngravitationally, a dark-matter-Schrodinger-cat-state (DMSCS), within the\nnonrelativistic approximation. In this work we improve this to a general\nrelativistic analysis. We firstly derive a single particle relativistic\nSchrodinger equation for a probe particle that passes through the DMSCS; the\ninteraction is provided by the weak field metric of general relativity from the\nsource. For a static DMSCS we find a neat generalization of our previous\nresults. We then turn to the interesting new case of a time dependent DMSCS,\nwhich can be provided by a coherently oscillating axion field leading to\nsuperposed time dependent oscillations in the metric; a truly quantum-general\nrelativistic phenomenon. We use scattering theory to derive the decoherence\nrate in all these cases. When the DMSCS is in a superposition of distinct\ndensity profiles, we find that the decoherence rate can be appreciable. We then\nconsider the novel special case in which the density is not in a superposition,\nbut the phase of its field oscillation is; this is a property that cannot be\ndecohered within the nonrelativistic framework. We find that if the probe\nparticle and/or the DMSCS's velocity dispersion is slow, then the rate of\ndecoherence of the phase is exponentially suppressed. However, if both the\nprobe and the DMSCS's velocity dispersion are relativistic, then the phase can\ndecohere more rapidly. As applications, we find that diffuse galactic axions\nwith superposed phases are robust against decoherence, while dense boson stars\nand regions near black hole horizons are not, and we discuss implications for\nexperiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2020 19:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 May 2021 20:31:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-26"}

By comparing the\nrole of disorder in a Kitaev chain with that in a nanowire, we find that\ndisorder affects both systems but in a nonuniversal manner. In general,\ndisorder has a much stronger effect on the nanowire than the Kitaev chain,\nparticularly for weak to intermediate disorder. For strong disorder, both the\nKitaev chain and nanowire manifest random featureless behavior due to universal\nAnderson localization.

Recently, p-type Sn2Nb2O7 and SnNb2O6 were developed; however,\nenhanced hole mobility by reducing defect concentrations is required for\npractical use. In this work, we investigate the correlation between the\nformation of oxygen vacancy which may reduce the hole-generation efficiency and\nhole mobility, and the crystal structure in Sn-Nb complex oxides. Extended\nX-ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy and Rietveld analysis of x-ray\ndiffraction revealed the preferential formation of oxygen vacancy at the O site\nbonded to the Sn ions in both the tin niobates. Moreover, a large amount of\noxygen vacancy around the Sn ions were found in the p-type Sn2Nb2O7, thereby\nindicating the effect of oxygen vacancy to the low hole-generation efficiency.\nThe dependence of the formation of oxygen vacancy on the crystal structure can\nbe elucidated from the Sn-O bond strength that is evaluated based on the bond\nvalence sum and Debye temperature. The differences in the bond strengths of the\ntwo Sn-Nb complex oxides are correlated through the steric hindrance of Sn2+\nwith asymmetric electron density distribution. This suggests the importance of\nthe material design with a focus on the local structure around the Sn ions to\nprevent the formation of oxygen vacancy in p-type Sn2+ oxides.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2020 19:09:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-25"}

We show that the\nmagnon band structure and Chern numbers of the magnon branches are\nsignificantly affected by the interlayer coupling $J_c$, which moreover has a\nqualitatively different effect in the ABC stacking compared to the AA stacking\nadopted by other authors. The nontrivial Chern number of the lowest magnon band\nis stabilized by the next-nearest-neighbour Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction in\neach honeycomb layer, resulting in the hopping term similar to that in the\nelectronic Haldane model for graphene. However, we also find several gapless\nWeyl points, separating the non-equivalent Chern insulating phases, tuned by\nthe ratio of the interlayer coupling $J_c$ and the third-neighbour Heisenberg\ninteraction $J_3$. We further show that the topological character of magnon\nbands results in non-zero thermal Hall conductivity, whose sign and magnitude\ndepend on $J_c$ and the intra-layer couplings.

Often, this characterization is achieved\nby fitting stellar evolution models to asteroseismic observations. The star\nunder investigation is then assumed to have the properties of the best-fitting\nmodel, such as its age. However, the models do not fit the observations\nperfectly. This is due to incorrect or missing physics in stellar evolution\ncalculations, resulting in predicted stellar structures that are discrepant\nwith reality. Through an inverse analysis of the asteroseismic data, it is\npossible to go further than fitting stellar models, and instead infer details\nabout the actual internal structure of the star at some locations in its\ninterior. Comparing theoretical and observed stellar structures then enables\nthe determination of the locations where the stellar models have discrepant\nstructure, and illuminates a path for improvements to our understanding of\nstellar evolution.

PSR J0537-6910\nhas the largest spin-down luminosity of any pulsar and is highly active with\nregards to glitches. Analyses of its long-term and inter-glitch braking indices\nprovided intriguing evidence that its spin-down energy budget may include\ngravitational-wave emission from a time-varying mass quadrupole moment. Its 62\nHz rotation frequency also puts its possible gravitational-wave emission in the\nmost sensitive band of LIGO/Virgo detectors. Motivated by these considerations,\nwe search for gravitational-wave emission at both once and twice the rotation\nfrequency. We find no signal, however, and report our upper limits. Assuming a\nrigidly rotating triaxial star, our constraints reach below the\ngravitational-wave spin-down limit for this star for the first time by more\nthan a factor of two and limit gravitational waves from the $l=m=2$ mode to\naccount for less than 14% of the spin-down energy budget.

Policymakers and DPT operators need to know\nwhether their system works as expected in terms of speed or yield (performance)\nand whether DPT is making an effective contribution to pandemic mitigation\n(also in comparison to and beyond established mitigation measures, particularly\nmanual contact tracing). Thereby, performance and effectiveness are not to be\nconfused. Not only are there conceptual differences but also diverse data\nrequirements. This article describes differences between performance and\neffectiveness measures and attempts to develop a terminology and classification\nsystem for DPT evaluation. We discuss key aspects for critical assessments of\nwhether the integration of additional data measurements into DPT apps - beyond\nwhat is required to fulfill its primary notification role - may facilitate an\nunderstanding of performance and effectiveness of planned and deployed DPT\napps. Therefore, the terminology and a classification matrix may offer some\nguidance to DPT system operators regarding which measurements to prioritize.\nDPT developers and operators may also make conscious decisions to integrate\nmeasures for epidemic monitoring but should be aware that this introduces a\nsecondary purpose to DPT that is not part of the original DPT design.\nUltimately, the integration of further information for epidemic monitoring into\nDPT involves a trade-off between data granularity and linkage on the one hand,\nand privacy on the other. Decision-makers should be aware of the trade-off and\ntake it into account when planning and developing DPT notification and\nmonitoring systems or intending to assess the added value of DPT relative to\nexisting contact tracing systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2020 19:19:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-25"}

At\nlower viscosities previous studies, based on 2D simulations have shown that\nmigration can be very chaotic and often characterized by phases of fast\nmigration. The reason is that in low-viscosity discs vortices appear due to the\nRossby-wave instability at the edges of the gap opened by the planet. Migration\nis then determined by vortex-planet interactions. Our aim is to study migration\nin low viscosity 3D discs. We performed numerical simulations using 2D\n(including self-gravity) and 3D codes. After selecting disc masses for which\nself-gravity is not important, 3D simulations without self-gravity can be\nsafely used. In our nominal simulation only numerical viscosity is present. We\nthen performed simulations with prescribed viscosity to assess the threshold\nbelow which the new migration processes appear. We show that for alpha\nviscosity <= 1.e-5 two migration modes are possible which differ from classical\nType-II migration, in the sense that they are not proportional to the disc's\nviscosity. The first occurs when the gap opened by the planet is not very deep.\nThis occurs in 3D simulations and/or when a big vortex forms at the outer edge\nof the planetary gap, diffusing material into the gap. We call this type of\nmigration \"vortex-driven migration\". This migration is very slow and cannot\ncontinue indefinitely, because eventually the vortex dissolves. The second\nmigration mode occurs when the gap is deep so that the planet's eccentricity\ngrows to a value ~0.2 due to inefficient eccentricity damping by corotation\nresonances. This second, faster migration mode appears to be typical of 2D\nmodels in discs with slower damping of temperature's perturbations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2020 19:36:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-03"}

Object detection process is inherently a challenging task as a generic\ncomputer vision problem, however, since the use of object detection algorithms\non UAVs (or on drones) is relatively a new area, it remains as a more\nchallenging problem to detect objects in aerial images. There are several\nreasons for that including: (i) the lack of large drone datasets including\nlarge object variance, (ii) the large orientation and scale variance in drone\nimages when compared to the ground images, and (iii) the difference in texture\nand shape features between the ground and the aerial images. Deep learning\nbased object detection algorithms can be classified under two main categories:\n(a) single-stage detectors and (b) multi-stage detectors. Both single-stage and\nmulti-stage solutions have their advantages and disadvantages over each other.\nHowever, a technique to combine the good sides of each of those solutions could\nyield even a stronger solution than each of those solutions individually. In\nthis paper, we propose an ensemble network, SyNet, that combines a multi-stage\nmethod with a single-stage one with the motivation of decreasing the high false\nnegative rate of multi-stage detectors and increasing the quality of the\nsingle-stage detector proposals.

The\npresence of a circumplanetary ring consisting of small water-ice particles has\na noticeable impact on the reflected polarized radiation.

Such a feature can be probed via gravitational-wave signals\nfrom binary neutron star inspirals that contain information of the induced\ntides. The dynamical part of the tides is caused by the resonance of pulsation\nmodes of stars, which causes a shift in the gravitational-wave phase. In this\npaper, we investigate the dynamical tides of the interfacial mode ($i$-mode) of\nspherical degree $l=2$, a non-radial mode caused by an interface associated\nwith a quark-hadron phase transition inside a hybrid star. In particular, we\nfocus on hybrid stars with a crystalline quark matter core and a fluid hadronic\nenvelope. We find that the resonant frequency of such $i$-modes typically\nranges from 300Hz to 1500Hz, and the frequency increases as the shear modulus\nof the quark core increases. We next estimate the detectability of such a mode\nwith existing and future gravitational-wave events from the inspiral waveform\nwith a Fisher analysis. We find that GW170817 and GW190425 have the potential\nto detect the $i$-mode if the quark-hadron phase transition occurs at\nsufficiently low pressure and the shear modulus of the quark matter phase is\nlarge enough.

The\nresulting algebraic (grid-free) approximation for the Coulomb tensor, closely\nrelated to the factorization appearing in pseudospectral and tensor\nhypercontraction approaches, is efficient and accurate, with significantly\nreduced rank compared to the naive (non-robust) approximation. Application of\nthe robust approximation to the particle-particle ladder term in the\ncoupled-cluster singles and doubles reduces the size complexity from\n$\\mathcal{O}(N^6)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(N^5)$ with robustness ensuring negligible\nerrors in chemically-relevant energy differences using CP ranks approximately\nequal to the size of the density-fitting basis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2020 22:06:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Feb 2021 03:36:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-22"}

Reinforcement learning (RL) approaches do not require\nsuch models, and instead learn domain dynamics by exploring the environment and\ncollecting rewards. However, RL approaches tend to require millions of episodes\nof experience and often learn policies that are not easily transferable to\nother tasks. In this paper, we address one aspect of the open problem of\nintegrating these approaches: how can decision-making agents resolve\ndiscrepancies in their symbolic planning models while attempting to accomplish\ngoals? We propose an integrated framework named SPOTTER that uses RL to augment\nand support (\"spot\") a planning agent by discovering new operators needed by\nthe agent to accomplish goals that are initially unreachable for the agent.\nSPOTTER outperforms pure-RL approaches while also discovering transferable\nsymbolic knowledge and does not require supervision, successful plan traces or\nany a priori knowledge about the missing planning operator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Dec 2020 00:31:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-25"}

At present,\nmost of the practical applications of machine learning use classic models based\non big data to solve the problem of small data sets. However, the deep neural\nnetwork model has complex structure, huge model parameters, and training\nrequires more advanced equipment, which brings certain difficulties to the\napplication. Therefore, this paper proposes the concept of union convolution,\ndesigning a light deep network model union-net with a shallow network structure\nand adapting to small data sets. This model combines convolutional network\nunits with different combinations of the same input to form a union module.\nEach union module is equivalent to a convolutional layer. The serial input and\noutput between the 3 modules constitute a \"3-layer\" neural network. The output\nof each union module is fused and added as the input of the last convolutional\nlayer to form a complex network with a 4-layer network structure. It solves the\nproblem that the deep network model network is too deep and the transmission\npath is too long, which causes the loss of the underlying information\ntransmission. Because the model has fewer model parameters and fewer channels,\nit can better adapt to small data sets.

In particular, a properly designed Runge-Kutta method will\ndamp out the errors committed in the initial stages. This is of particular\ninterest when we consider implicit Runge-Kutta methods. In such cases, the\nimplicit computation of the stage values can be considerably faster if the\nsolution can be of lower precision (or, equivalently, have a lower tolerance).\nWe provide a general theoretical additive framework for designing mixed\nprecision Runge-Kutta methods, and use this framework to derive order\nconditions for such methods. Next, we show how using this approach allows us to\nleverage low precision computation of the implicit solver while retaining high\nprecision in the overall method. We present the behavior of some\nmixed-precision implicit Runge-Kutta methods through numerical studies, and\ndemonstrate how the numerical results match with the theoretical framework.\nThis novel mixed-precision implicit Runge-Kutta framework opens the door to the\ndesign of many such methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Dec 2020 01:14:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-25"}

While the column density and\nvelocity structures of both filaments and hubs have been studied, their\nmagnetic fields (B-field) are not yet characterized. We aim to understand the\nrole of the B-field in the dynamical evolution of the NGC 6334 hub-filament\nnetwork. We present new observations of the dust polarized emission at\n850$\\mu$m towards NGC 6334 obtained with the JCMT/POL-2. We study the\ndistribution and dispersion of the polarized intensity ($PI$), the polarization\nfraction ($PF$), and the B-field angle ($\\theta_{B}$). We derive the power\nspectrum of the intensity and $\\theta_{B}$ along the ridge crest. Our analyses\nshow a complex B-field structure when observed over the whole region ($\\sim10$\npc), however, at smaller scales ($\\sim1$ pc), $\\theta_{B}$ varies coherently\nalong the filaments. The observed power spectrum of $\\theta_{B}$ can be well\nrepresented with a power law function with a slope $-1.33\\pm0.23$, which is\n$\\sim20\\%$ shallower than that of $I$. This result is compatible with the\nproperties of simulated filaments and may indicate the processes at play in the\nformation of filaments. $\\theta_{B}$ rotates from being mostly perpendicular to\nthe filament crests to mostly parallel as they merge with the hubs. This\nvariation of $\\theta_{B}$ may be tracing local velocity flows of matter\nin-falling onto the hubs. Our analysis suggests a variation of the energy\nbalance along the crests of these filaments, from magnetically\ncritical/supercritical at their far ends to magnetically subcritical near the\nhubs.

Nowadays, investigating\nproper priors into the unmixing problem has been popular as it can\nsignificantly enhance the unmixing performance. However, it is non-trivial to\nhandcraft a powerful regularizer, and complex regularizers may introduce extra\ndifficulties in solving optimization problems in which they are involved. To\naddress this issue, we present a plug-and-play (PnP) priors framework for\nhyperspectral unmixing. More specifically, we use the alternating direction\nmethod of multipliers (ADMM) to decompose the optimization problem into two\niterative subproblems. One is a regular optimization problem depending on the\nforward model, and the other is a proximity operator related to the prior model\nand can be regarded as an image denoising problem. Our framework is flexible\nand extendable which allows a wide range of denoisers to replace prior models\nand avoids handcrafting regularizers.

The XRD patterns were\nutilized to determine the structural parameters (lattice strain and crystallite\nsize) of ITO with different thicknesses.

In this paper, we explore this\ninconsistency caused by misclassified examples and add a novel consistency\nregularization term to make better use of the misclassified examples.\nSpecifically, we identified that the certified robustness of network can be\nsignificantly improved if the constraint of certified robustness on\nmisclassified examples and correctly classified examples is consistent.\nMotivated by this discovery, we design a new defense regularization term called\nMisclassification Aware Adversarial Regularization (MAAR), which constrains the\noutput probability distributions of all examples in the certified region of the\nmisclassified example.

The laser\nfeatures high modulation performance because of the accumulated strong coupling\nof the slow-light feedback from the surrounding lateral TCCs into the VCSEL\ncavity. Photon-photon resonance (PPR) is predicted to occur at ultra-high\nfrequencies exceeding 145 GHz due to the optical feedback from short TCCs,\nwhich achieves 3-dB MBW reaching 170 GHz. The study is based on the modeling of\nthe VCSEL dynamics under multiple transverse slow-light feedback from the\nsurrounding TCCs. We show that the integration of the VCSEL with four or six\nfeedback cavities is advantageous over the TCC-VCSEL in achieving much higher\nMBW enhancement under weaker coupling of slow-light into the VCSEL cavity.

The contingencies are filtered to distinguish those\nthat will be treated with preventive actions from those that will be left for\ncorrective actions. The selected contingencies for preventive action are\nincluded in the set of security constraints. Benders decomposition is employed\nto decompose the convexified Security-Constrained ACOPF problem into a master\nproblem and several security check sub-problems. Sub-problems are evaluated in\na parallel computing process with enhanced computational efficiency. AGC within\neach sub-problem is modeled by a set of proposed valid constraints, so the\nprocured solution is the physical response of each generation unit during a\ncontingency.

As reducing precision is one of the most\neffective knobs for boosting training time/energy efficiency, there has been a\ngrowing interest in low-precision DNN training. In this paper, we explore from\nan orthogonal direction: how to fractionally squeeze out more training cost\nsavings from the most redundant bit level, progressively along the training\ntrajectory and dynamically per input. Specifically, we propose FracTrain that\nintegrates (i) progressive fractional quantization which gradually increases\nthe precision of activations, weights, and gradients that will not reach the\nprecision of SOTA static quantized DNN training until the final training stage,\nand (ii) dynamic fractional quantization which assigns precisions to both the\nactivations and gradients of each layer in an input-adaptive manner, for only\n\"fractionally\" updating layer parameters.

One natural way for formulating this\nproblem is spectral hashing that directly incorporates affinity to learn binary\ncodes. However, due to binary constraints, the optimization becomes\nintractable. To mitigate this challenge, different relaxation approaches have\nbeen proposed to reduce the computational load of obtaining binary codes and\nstill attain a good solution. The problem with all existing relaxation methods\nis resorting to one or more additional auxiliary variables to attain high\nquality binary codes while relaxing the problem. The existence of auxiliary\nvariables leads to coordinate descent approach which increases the\ncomputational complexity. We argue that introducing these variables is\nunnecessary. To this end, we propose a novel relaxed formulation for spectral\nhashing that adds no additional variables to the problem. Furthermore, instead\nof solving the problem in original space where number of variables is equal to\nthe data points, we solve the problem in a much smaller space and retrieve the\nbinary codes from this solution.

Thus,\nin this study, we investigate changes in travel patterns in response to the\nCOVID-19 outbreak and related policy measures in Japan using longitudinal\naggregated mobile phone data. Specifically, we consider daily travel patterns\nas networks and analyze their structural changes by applying a framework for\nanalyzing temporal networks used in network science. The cluster analysis with\nthe network similarity measures across different dates showed that there are\nsix main types of mobility patterns in the three major metropolitan areas of\nJapan: (I) weekends and holidays prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, (II) weekdays\nprior to the COVID-19 outbreak, (III) weekends and holidays before and after\nthe SOE, (IV) weekdays before and after the SOE, (V) weekends and holidays\nduring the SOE, and (VI) weekdays during the SOE.

The PBik theory is a generalization of the classical\nPoisson-Boltzmann theory to include different steric energies of\ndifferent-sized ions and water similar to different electrical energies for\ndifferent-charged ions. Water and ions with interstitial voids in this\nmolecular mean field theory have their physical volumes as they do in molecular\ndynamics simulations. The PBik formula derived from Fermi distributions of ions\nand water in arbitrary shape and volume reduces to the Bikerman-Freise formula\nderived from the lattice model of equal-sized ions. The DC curves predicted by\nthe Gouy-Chapman formula are U-shaped (for point-like ions with zero volume and\nvery dilute solutions). The curves change from U shape to camel shape\n(Bactrian) and then to bell shape (for finite size ions) as the volume fraction\nof ions and water changes from zero to medium value then to large value. The\ntransition is characterized by critical and inflection voltages in terms of the\nparticle volume fraction. These voltages determine steric and electrical\nenergies that describe the space/charge competition and saturation properties\nof ions and water packed in the condensed layer of EDLs under high field\nconditions.

PBik computes symmetric DC curves from delicately balanced steric\ninteractions of asymmetric-size ions and water like the experimental data of\nKPF6 in aqueous solution.

However, the environment\naround the tunnel is composed mostly of an elliptical wall. Thereby, the unique\nfeature points for map matching are few unlike the case outdoors. As a result,\nit is a very difficult condition to perform vehicle navigation in the tunnel\nwith existing map-aided localization. In this paper, we propose tunnel\nfacility-based precise vehicle localization in highway tunnels using 3D LIDAR.\nFor vehicle localization in a highway tunnel, a point landmark map that stores\nthe center points of tunnel facilities and a probability distribution map that\nstores the probability distributions of the lane markings are used. Point\nlandmark-based localization is possible regardless of the number of feature\npoints, if only representative points of an object can be extracted. Therefore,\nit is a suitable localization method for highway tunnels where the feature\npoints are few. The tunnel facility points were extracted using 3D LIDAR.\nPosition estimation is conducted using an EKF-based navigation filter. The\nproposed localization algorithm is verified through experiments using actual\nhighway driving data.

Providing an\nadequate quality of experience to these applications is of paramount importance\nfor a network provider. The offered services are often regulated by tight\nService Level Agreements that needs to be continuously monitored. Since the\nfirst step to guarantee a metric is to measure it, delay measurement becomes a\nfundamental operation for a network provider. In many cases, the operator needs\nto measure the delay on all network links. We refer to the collection of all\nlink delays as the Link Delay Vector (LDV). Typical solutions to collect the\nLDV impose a substantial overhead on the network. In this paper, we propose a\nsolution to measure the LDV in real-time with a low-overhead approach. In\nparticular, we inject some flows into the network and infer the LDV based on\nthe delay of those flows. To this end, the monitoring flows and their paths\nshould be selected minimizing the network monitoring overhead. In this respect,\nthe challenging issue is to select a proper combination of flows such that by\nknowing their delay it is possible to solve a set of a linear equation and\nobtain a unique LDV. We first propose a mathematical formulation to select the\noptimal combination of flows, in form of ILP problem. Then we develop a\nheuristic algorithm to overcome the high computational complexity of existing\nILP solvers. As a further step, we propose a meta-heuristic algorithm to solve\nthe above-mentioned equations and infer the LDV. The challenging part of this\nstep is the volatility of link delays. The proposed solution is evaluated over\nreal-world emulated network topologies using the Mininet network emulator.\nEmulation results show the accuracy of the proposed solution with a negligible\nnetworking overhead in a real-time manner.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Dec 2020 09:49:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Dec 2020 09:53:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 1 Jan 2021 10:51:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-05"}

Data sharing is done in an initial context which\nis chosen by the users. However, data are used by social networks and third\nparties in different contexts which are often not transparent. In order to\nunveil such usages, we propose an approach which focuses on the effects of data\nsharing in impactful real-life situations. Focus is put on visual content\nbecause of its strong influence in shaping online user profiles. The approach\nrelies on three components: (1) a set of visual objects with associated\nsituation impact ratings obtained by crowdsourcing, (2) a corresponding set of\nobject detectors for mining users' photos and (3) a ground truth dataset made\nof 500 visual user profiles which are manually rated per situation. These\ncomponents are combined in LERVUP, a method which learns to rate visual user\nprofiles in each situation. LERVUP exploits a new image descriptor which\naggregates object ratings and object detections at user level and an attention\nmechanism which boosts highly-rated objects to prevent them from being\noverwhelmed by low-rated ones. Performance is evaluated per situation by\nmeasuring the correlation between the automatic ranking of profile ratings and\na manual ground truth. Results indicate that LERVUP is effective since a strong\ncorrelation of the two rankings is obtained. A practical implementation of the\napproach in a mobile app which raises user awareness about shared data usage is\nalso discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Dec 2020 09:52:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 7 Nov 2021 17:53:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-09"}

This\nproblem is formulated as an optimization problem whose goal is to minimize the\ntransmit power of UAVs via adjusting UAV deployment, phase shift of RISs, user\nassociation and RIS association. To solve this problem, the original\noptimization problem is divided into four subproblems and an alternating\nalgorithm is proposed.

Since the problems of user association and RIS\nassociation are integer programming, the fraction relaxation method is adopted\nbefore using dual method to find the optimal solution.

Inspired by the success, here we attempt to leverage\nNAS techniques to automatically design efficient network architectures for\nlow-level image restoration tasks. In particular, we propose a memory-efficient\nhierarchical NAS (termed HiNAS) and apply it to two such tasks: image denoising\nand image super-resolution. HiNAS adopts gradient based search strategies and\nbuilds a flexible hierarchical search space, including the inner search space\nand outer search space. They are in charge of designing cell architectures and\ndeciding cell widths, respectively. For the inner search space, we propose a\nlayer-wise architecture sharing strategy (LWAS), resulting in more flexible\narchitectures and better performance. For the outer search space, we design a\ncell-sharing strategy to save memory, and considerably accelerate the search\nspeed. The proposed HiNAS method is both memory and computation efficient. With\na single GTX1080Ti GPU, it takes only about 1 hour for searching for denoising\nnetwork on the BSD-500 dataset and 3.5 hours for searching for the\nsuper-resolution structure on the DIV2K dataset. Experiments show that the\narchitectures found by HiNAS have fewer parameters and enjoy a faster inference\nspeed, while achieving highly competitive performance compared with\nstate-of-the-art methods.

Although some solutions give really good results\nin a controlled environment (no occlusion), recognition in the presence of\npartial facial occlusion remains a challenging task. To handle occlusions,\nsolutions based on the reconstruction of the occluded part of the face have\nbeen proposed. These solutions are mainly based on the texture or the geometry\nof the face. However, the similarity of the face movement between different\npersons doing the same expression seems to be a real asset for the\nreconstruction. In this paper we exploit this asset and propose a new solution\nbased on an auto-encoder with skip connections to reconstruct the occluded part\nof the face in the optical flow domain. To the best of our knowledge, this is\nthe first proposition to directly reconstruct the movement for facial\nexpression recognition. We validated our approach in the controlled dataset CK+\non which different occlusions were generated. Our experiments show that the\nproposed method reduce significantly the gap, in terms of recognition accuracy,\nbetween occluded and non-occluded situations.

These applications feature complex,\nhighly parametric incentive mechanisms to equilibrate the loan market. This\ncomplexity makes the behaviour of lending pools difficult to understand and to\npredict: indeed, ineffective incentives and attacks could potentially lead to\nemergent unwanted behaviours. Reasoning about lending pools is made even harder\nby the lack of executable models of their behaviour: to precisely understand\nhow users interact with lending pools, eventually one has to inspect their\nimplementations, where the incentive mechanisms are intertwined with low-level\nimplementation details. Further, the variety of existing implementations makes\nit difficult to distill the common aspects of lending pools. We systematize the\nexisting knowledge about lending pools, leveraging a new formal model of\ninteractions with users, which reflects the archetypal features of mainstream\nimplementations. This enables us to prove some general properties of lending\npools, such as the correct handling of funds, and to precisely describe\nvulnerabilities and attacks. We also discuss the role of lending pools in the\nbroader context of decentralized finance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Dec 2020 12:53:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-25"}

We measured a flare occurrence rate of 6.35\nflares per day for flares with amplitudes in the range of $0.06\\% < f_{\\rm max}\n< 1.5\\%$ of the star flux. We employed a Bayesian MCMC analysis to model the\nfive transits of AU Mic b, improving the constraints on the planetary\nparameters. The planet radius of $4.07\\pm0.17$~R$_{\\oplus}$ and a mean density\nof $1.4\\pm0.4$~g~cm$^{-3}$ confirms that it is a Neptune-size moderately\ninflated planet. While a single feature possibly due to a second planet was\npreviously reported in the former TESS data, we report the detection of two\nadditional transit-like events in the new TESS observations of July 2020. This\nrepresents substantial evidence for a second planet (AU Mic c) in the system.\nWe analyzed its three transits and obtained an orbital period of\n$18.859019\\pm0.000016$~d and a planetary radius of $3.24\\pm0.16$~R$_{\\oplus}$,\nwhich defines it as a warm Neptune-size planet with an expected mass in the\nrange of 2.2~M$_{\\oplus}$~$< M_{\\rm c} < $25.0~M$_{\\oplus}$.

However,\nthe investigation of users' personalized preferences on the diversity\nproperties of an item set is usually ignored. To overcome this problem, we\npropose the Linear Modular Dispersion Bandit (LMDB) framework, which is an\nonline learning setting for optimizing a combination of modular functions and\ndispersion functions.

The objective function is\ntraditionally defined by adding a regularization function to a data fit term,\nwhich is subsequently minimized by using iterative optimization algorithms.\nRecently, several works have proposed to replace the operator related to the\nregularization by a more sophisticated denoiser. These approaches, known as\nplug-and-play (PnP) methods, have shown excellent performance. Although it has\nbeen noticed that, under some Lipschitz properties on the denoisers, the\nconvergence of the resulting algorithm is guaranteed, little is known about\ncharacterizing the asymptotically delivered solution. In the current article,\nwe propose to address this limitation. More specifically, instead of employing\na functional regularization, we perform an operator regularization, where a\nmaximally monotone operator (MMO) is learned in a supervised manner. This\nformulation is flexible as it allows the solution to be characterized through a\nbroad range of variational inequalities, and it includes convex regularizations\nas special cases. From an algorithmic standpoint, the proposed approach\nconsists in replacing the resolvent of the MMO by a neural network (NN). We\npresent a universal approximation theorem proving that nonexpansive NNs are\nsuitable models for the resolvent of a wide class of MMOs. The proposed\napproach thus provides a sound theoretical framework for analyzing the\nasymptotic behavior of first-order PnP algorithms. In addition, we propose a\nnumerical strategy to train NNs corresponding to resolvents of MMOs.

It is essentially different from a conventional\nquantum search algorithm. It is constructed with the duality-character oracle\noperations of unstructured search problem. It consists of the two consecutive\nsteps: (1) the search-space dynamical reduction and (2) the dynamical\nquantum-state-difference amplification (QUANSDAM). The QUANSDAM process is\ndirectly constructed with the SIC unitary propagators, while the latter each\nare prepared with the basic SIC unitary operators. Here the preparation for the\nSIC unitary propagators of a single-atom system is concretely carried out by\nstarting from the basic SIC unitary operators. The SIC unitary propagator of a\nquantum system may reflect the quantum symmetry of the quantum system, while\nthe basic SIC unitary operators may not. The quantum symmetry is considered as\nthe fundamental quantum-computing-speedup resource in the quantum-computing\nspeedup theory.

The main idea in IntroVAE is to train a VAE\nadversarially, using the VAE encoder to discriminate between generated and real\ndata samples. However, the original IntroVAE loss function relied on a\nparticular hinge-loss formulation that is very hard to stabilize in practice,\nand its theoretical convergence analysis ignored important terms in the loss.\nIn this work, we take a step towards better understanding of the IntroVAE\nmodel, its practical implementation, and its applications.

This precludes both optimal calibration\nand quantification of uncertainties. Traditional Bayesian calibration methods\nthat allow uncertainty quantification are too expensive for climate models;\nthey are also not robust in the presence of internal climate variability. For\nexample, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods typically require $O(10^5)$\nmodel runs and are sensitive to internal variability noise, rendering them\ninfeasible for climate models. Here we demonstrate an approach to model\ncalibration and uncertainty quantification that requires only $O(10^2)$ model\nruns and can accommodate internal climate variability. The approach consists of\nthree stages: (i) a calibration stage uses variants of ensemble Kalman\ninversion to calibrate a model by minimizing mismatches between model and data\nstatistics; (ii) an emulation stage emulates the parameter-to-data map with\nGaussian processes (GP), using the model runs in the calibration stage for\ntraining; (iii) a sampling stage approximates the Bayesian posterior\ndistributions by sampling the GP emulator with MCMC.

Existing works have focused on solving\n(vehicle) routing problems as they have a nice balance between non-triviality\nand difficulty. State-of-the-art approaches learn a policy using reinforcement\nlearning, and the learnt policy acts as a pseudo solver. These approaches have\ndemonstrated good performance in some cases, but given the large search space\ntypical combinatorial/routing problem, they can converge too quickly to poor\npolicy. To prevent this, in this paper, we propose an approach name entropy\nregularised reinforcement learning (ERRL) that supports exploration by\nproviding more stochastic policies, which tends to improve optimisation.\nEmpirically, the low variance ERRL offers RL training fast and stable. We also\nintroduce a combination of local search operators during test time, which\nsignificantly improves solution and complement ERRL.

In the classical theory, systems with\ninfinite-dimensional targets are considered as well (this then encompasses also\nhigher-dimensional field theories in the hamiltonian formalism). The properties\nof the Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) action are described in details and several\nexamples are explicitly computed (including nonabelian Chern-Simons theory,\nwhere the HJ action turns out to be the gauged Wess-Zumino-Witten action).\nPerturbative quantization, limited in this note to finite-dimensional targets,\nis performed in the framework of the Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV) formalism in the\nbulk and of the Batalin-Fradkin-Vilkovisky (BFV) formalism at the endpoints. As\na sanity check of the method, it is proved that the semiclassical contribution\nof the physical part of the evolution operator is still given by the HJ action.\nSeveral examples are computed explicitly. In particular, it is shown that the\ntoy model for nonabelian Chern-Simons theory and the toy model for 7D\nChern-Simons theory with nonlinear Hitchin polarization do not have quantum\ncorrections in the physical part (the extension of these results to the actual\ncases is discussed in the companion paper [arXiv:2012.13983]).

We derive sufficient\nconditions for Lyapunov stability of a DLCS when using a quadratic Lyapunov\nfunction that depends only on the state variables and a quadratic Lyapunov\nfunction that depends both on the state and the algebraic variables. The\nsufficient conditions require checking the feasibility of a copositive program\nover nonconvex cones. Our results only assume that the LCP is solvable and do\nnot require the solutions to be unique. We devise a novel, exact cutting plane\nalgorithm for the verification of stability and the computation of the Lyapunov\nfunctions. To the best of our knowledge, our algorithm is the first exact\napproach for stability verification of DLCS. A number of numerical examples are\npresented to illustrate the approach. Though our main object of study in this\npaper is the DLCS, the proposed algorithm can be readily applied to the\nstability verification of LCS. In this context, we show the equivalence between\nthe stability of a LCS and the DLCS, resulting from a time-stepping procedure\napplied to the LCS for all sufficiently small time steps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Dec 2020 15:09:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-25"}

The interviewer knows\nhow each candidate ranks relative to all others seen so far, and must\nimmediately appoint or reject each candidate as they arrive. The aim is to\nchoose the best overall. The $1/e$ strategy is to follow the rule: `Do nothing\nuntil time $1/e$, then appoint the first candidate thereafter who is best so\nfar (if any).'\n  The question, first discussed with Larry Shepp in 1983, was to know whether\nthe $1/e$-strategy is optimal if one has `no information about the total number\nof options'. Quite what this might mean is open to various interpretations, but\nwe shall take the proportional-increment process formulation of \\cite{BY}. Such\nprocesses are shown to have a very rigid structure, being time-changed {\\em\npure birth processes}, and this allows some precise distributional\ncalculations, from which we deduce that the $1/e$-strategy is in fact not\noptimal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Dec 2020 15:10:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-25"}

Diffused\ngraph signals, which correspond to an originally sparse (node-localized) signal\npercolated through the graph via filtering, fall into this class. In that\ncontext, this paper deals with the problem of jointly identifying graph filters\nand separating their (sparse) input signals from a mixture of diffused graph\nsignals, thus generalizing to the graph signal processing framework the\nclassical blind demixing (blind source separation) of temporal and spatial\nsignals.

In addition to\nthe standard media such as electrons and photons as CMB, we consider the medium\nwith invisible axions. The amount of GRB delays in different media are\ncalculated in details utilizing a novel technique in QFT by using the hitherto\nknown or estimated densities of particles in the space without introducing any\narbitrary parameter. Previously, the GRB delays have been interpreted as a sign\nof Lorentz invariance violation by modifying the dispersion relation of Special\nRelativity, which relates the energy, the momentum and the mass of a particle,\nbased on different mechanisms ii), such as a stringy spacetime foam, coming\nfrom a quantum gravity effect and using an adjustable parameter. Obviously, all\nthe above-mentioned mechanisms i) and ii) are induced (seeming) Lorentz\ninvariance violations but not an intrinsic (genuine) one. The amount of GRB\ndelay due to the two aforementioned interpretations can be distinguished by\nobserving the time of arrival of light with different frequencies. Namely,\ndispersion of light i) predicts that the higher energy GRB arrive the Earth\nearlier, while in the other interpretations ii), they arrive later.

Should this happen, it is likely that vehicles\npresently powered by hydrocarbons will be progressively replaced by Battery\nElectric Vehicles (BEVs). This paper describes the use of mathematical\nmodelling, drawing on real time records of the UK electricity grid, to\ninvestigate the likely performance of the grid when supplying power to a fleet\nof up to 35 million BEVs. The model highlights the importance of understanding\nhow the grid will cope when powering a BEV fleet under conditions similar to\nthose experienced during an extended wind lull during the 3rd week of January\n2017. Allowing a two-way flow of electricity between the BEVs and the grid,\nknown as the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) configuration, turns out to be of key\nimportance in minimising the need for additional gas turbine generation or\nenergy storage during wind lulls. This study has shown that with the use of\nV2G, it should be possible to provide power to about 15 million BEVs with the\ngas turbine capacity currently available. Without V2G, it is likely that the\ncurrent capacity of the gas turbines and associated gas infrastructure might be\noverwhelmed by even a relatively small BEV fleet. Since it is anticipated that\n80% of BEV owners will be able to park the vehicles at their residences,\nwidespread V2G will enable both the powering of residences when supply from the\ngrid is constrained and the charging of BEVs when supply is in excess. The\nmodel shows that this configuration will maintain a constant load on the grid\nand avoid the use of either expensive alternative storage or hydrogen obtained\nby reforming methane. There should be no insuperable problem in providing power\nto the 20% of BEV owners who do not have parking at their residences; their\npower could come directly from the grid.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Dec 2020 03:40:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-05"}

A UAV identified as an aerial base station communicates with a\nground base station over an RF channel. The communication units have dynamics\nbased on the logistic map. The map is chaotic in the appropriate parameter\nspace. Its states are non-periodic, broadband, and noise-like in the frequency\ndomain. They are useful for spreading information during transmission, making\nit difficult for an eavesdropper to recover the modulated message since state\nprediction is ultimately impossible. To retrieve it, we propose a variable\nfeedback controller. It asymptotically stabilizes the error dynamics when the\ninformation source is off. During transmission, the controller synchronizes the\nunits such that the error contains signatures of the information signal.\nTherefore, the information signal is retrievable by a suitable detection\nmechanism. Security depends on the confidentiality of the map, the variable\nfeedback controller, including its scale factor and bounded feedback gain, and\nthe designer`s choice of invertible function for use in the scrambling and\ndescrambling process. Also, the method is less prone to jamming attacks and\nmultipath effects as the broadband spectrum can be used to randomly select RF\nchannels. It uses only a few simple algorithms, including a correlation\nsummation and a detection mechanism. The algorithms collect subsamples of the\nreceived signal sequences and averages over each subsample length. The method\nrequires minimal programming efforts and low hardware resource utilization. It\nis energy-efficient, which is a vital consideration for any UAV security model.\nMoreover, we realize a prototype of the communication system on\nfield-programmable gate arrays.

In this paper, we focus on nature-inspired optimization algorithms\nconcerning the optimal coverage in WSNs. In the first half of the paper, we\nhave briefly discussed the taxonomy of the optimization algorithms along with\nthe problem domains in WSNs. In the second half of the paper, we have compared\nthe performance of two nature-inspired algorithms for getting optimal coverage\nin WSNs. The first one is a combined Improved Genetic Algorithm and Binary Ant\nColony Algorithm (IGABACA), and the second one is Lion Optimization (LO). The\nsimulation results confirm that LO gives better network coverage, and the\nconvergence rate of LO is faster than that of IGA-BACA. Further, we observed\nthat the optimal coverage is achieved at a lesser number of generations in LO\nas compared to IGA-BACA. This review will help researchers to explore the\napplications in this field as well as beyond this area.
