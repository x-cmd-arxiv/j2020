Detecting this attack\nis particularly important as it can be a threat to corporate secrets and can be\nused to steal information or commit fraud. In this paper, a machine\nlearning-based approach is proposed to tackle the typosquatting vulnerability.\nTo that end, exploratory data analytics is first used to better understand the\ntrends observed in eight domain name-based extracted features. Furthermore, a\nmajority voting-based ensemble learning classifier built using five\nclassification algorithms is proposed that can detect suspicious domains with\nhigh accuracy. Moreover, the observed trends are validated by studying the same\nfeatures in an unlabeled dataset using K-means clustering algorithm and through\napplying the developed ensemble learning classifier. Results show that\nlegitimate domains have a smaller domain name length and fewer unique\ncharacters. Moreover, the developed ensemble learning classifier performs\nbetter in terms of accuracy, precision, and F-score. Furthermore, it is shown\nthat similar trends are observed when clustering is used. However, the number\nof domains identified as potentially suspicious is high. Hence, the ensemble\nlearning classifier is applied with results showing that the number of domains\nidentified as potentially suspicious is reduced by almost a factor of five\nwhile still maintaining the same trends in terms of features' statistics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Dec 2020 16:51:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-29"}

To achieve the low-rank, we solve a\ngeneralized eigenvalue problem in each subdomain. NOSAS have the minimum energy\nfor a given rank of the coarse space. The condition number of the NOSAS methods\ndoes not depend on the coefficients. Additionally, the NOSAS methods have good\nparallelization properties.

However, a\ncomprehensive picture of topological phases and topological phase transitions\nin cold magnetized plasmas is still missing.

A sufficient and\nnecessary condition for the existence of this type of edge modes is given and\nverified by numerical solutions.

This development is\npart of a new class of dense, hydrogen rich materials with remarkably high\ncritical temperatures. Metal superhydrides are a subclass of these materials\nthat provide a different and potentially more promising route to very high Tc\nsuperconductivity. The most promising binary metal superhydrides contain\nalkaline or rare earth elements, and recent experimental observations of LaH10\nhave shown them capable of Tc s up to 250 to 260 kelvin. Predictions have shown\nyttrium superhydrides to be the most promising with an estimated Tc in excess\nof 300 kelvin for YH10. Here we report the synthesis of an yttrium superhydride\nthat exhibits superconductivity at a critical temperature of 262 kelvin at 182\ngigapascal. A palladium thin film assists the synthesis by protecting the\nsputtered yttrium from oxidation and promoting subsequent hydrogenation. Phonon\nmediated superconductivity is established by the observation of zero\nresistance, an isotope effect and the reduction of Tc under an external\nmagnetic field. The upper critical magnetic field is 103 tesla at zero\ntemperature. We suggest YH9 is the synthesized product based on comparison of\nthe measured Raman spectra and Tc to calculated Raman results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Dec 2020 20:38:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-24"}

While the effect of factors such as model\ncapacity and scale of training data on adversarial robustness have been\nextensively studied, little attention has been paid to the effect of a very\nimportant parameter in every network optimization on adversarial robustness:\nthe learning rate. In particular, we hypothesize that effective learning rate\nscheduling during adversarial training can significantly reduce the overfitting\nissue, to a degree where one does not even need to adversarially train a model\nfrom scratch but can instead simply adversarially fine-tune a pre-trained\nmodel. Motivated by this hypothesis, we propose a simple yet very effective\nadversarial fine-tuning approach based on a $\\textit{slow start, fast decay}$\nlearning rate scheduling strategy which not only significantly decreases\ncomputational cost required, but also greatly improves the accuracy and\nrobustness of a deep neural network.

The appearance of the gauge potential can\nbe ascribed to the motional (magneto-electric) Stark effect which is\nresponsible for the presence of a linear-in-momentum contribution to the\nexciton kinetic energy. We study the interplay of this phenomenon with the\ncompeting effect which arises from the Rabi-splitting renormalization due the\nreduction of the electron-hole overlap for a moving exciton. Accounting for\nthis mechanism is crucial in the structures with the high ratio of Rabi\nsplitting and the exciton binding energy. Besides, we propose an approach which\nboosts the gauge field in the considered system. It takes advantage of the\ncrossover from the hydrogen-like exciton to the strongly dipole-polarized\nexciton state at a specific choice of electric and magnetic fields. The strong\nsensitivity of the exciton energy to the momentum in this regime leads to the\nlarge values of the gauge field.

The problem is best addressed by\nforward modeling where different initial conditions and Neptune's orbital\nevolutions are tested, and the model predictions are compared to orbits of\nknown Kuiper belt objects (KBOs). It has previously been established that\nNeptune radially migrated, by gravitationally interacting with an outer disk of\nplanetesimals, from the original radial distance r < 25 au to its current orbit\nat 30 au. Here we show that the migration models with a very low orbital\neccentricity of Neptune e_N < 0.05 do not explain KBOs with semimajor axes 50 <\na < 60 au, perihelion distances q > 35 au and inclinations i < 10 deg. If e_N <\n0.05 at all times, the Kozai cycles control the implantation process and the\norbits with q > 35 au end up having, due to the angular momentum's z-component\nconservation, i > 10 deg. Better results are obtained when Neptune's\neccentricity is excited to e_N ~ 0.1 and subsequently damped by dynamical\nfriction. The low-e & low-i orbits at 50-60 au are produced in this model when\nKBOs are lifted from the scattered disk by secular cycles -- mainly the apsidal\nresonance nu_8 -- near various mean motion resonances. These results give\nsupport to a (mild) dynamical instability that presumably excited the orbits of\ngiant planets during Neptune's early migration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Dec 2020 23:57:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-03"}

We also propose a joint max-margin\nobjective function, which enforces that the minimum score of positive labels\nshould be larger than the maximum score of negative labels horizontally and\nvertically. This function can further improve our multi-label image\nclassification method. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method on two\npopular multi-label image datasets (i.e., Pascal VOC and MS-COCO). Our\nexperimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Dec 2020 02:36:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-29"}

Convergence of the AoI occupancy measure to the fluid limit,\nrepresented by a Partial Derivative Equation (PDE), is proved within an\napproximation error inversely proportional to the number of users. Global\nconvergence to the equilibrium of the PDE, i.e., stationary AoI distribution,\nis also proved. Based on this framework, it is shown that an existing AoI lower\nbound in the literature is in fact asymptotically tight, and a simple threshold\npolicy, with the thresholds explicitly derived, achieves the optimum\nasymptotically. The proposed threshold-based policy is also much easier to\ndecentralize than the widely-known index-based policies which require comparing\nuser indices. To showcase the usability of the framework, we also use it to\nanalyze the average non-linear AoI functions (with power and logarithm forms)\nin wireless networks.

To\nhandle this problem, some recent works adopt clustering algorithms to off-line\ngenerate pseudo labels, which can then be used as the supervision signal for\non-line feature learning in the target domain. However, the off-line generated\nlabels often contain lots of noise that significantly hinders the\ndiscriminability of the on-line learned features, and thus limits the final UDA\nre-ID performance. To this end, we propose a novel approach, called\nDual-Refinement, that jointly refines pseudo labels at the off-line clustering\nphase and features at the on-line training phase, to alternatively boost the\nlabel purity and feature discriminability in the target domain for more\nreliable re-ID. Specifically, at the off-line phase, a new hierarchical\nclustering scheme is proposed, which selects representative prototypes for\nevery coarse cluster. Thus, labels can be effectively refined by using the\ninherent hierarchical information of person images. Besides, at the on-line\nphase, we propose an instant memory spread-out (IM-spread-out) regularization,\nthat takes advantage of the proposed instant memory bank to store sample\nfeatures of the entire dataset and enable spread-out feature learning over the\nentire training data instantly.

Next, in each slit where variable separation is still available, wave\nfield could be expressed as a Fourier series in terms of a countable basis\nfunctions with unknown Fourier coefficients. Finally, by matching field on the\naperture, we establish a linear system of infinite number of equations\ngoverning the countable Fourier coefficients.

The Hamiltonian function is a constant of\nmotion (the energy) of the system. The properties of the Poisson bracket are\nencapsulated in the symplectic 2-form, a closed second order differential form.\nDue to closure, the symplectic 2-form is preserved by the Hamiltonian flow, and\nit assigns an invariant (Liouville) measure on the phase space through the\nLie-Darboux theorem. In this paper we propose a generalization of classical\nHamiltonian mechanics to a three-dimensional phase space: the classical Poisson\nbracket is replaced with a generalized Poisson bracket acting on a pair of\nHamiltonian functions, while the symplectic 2-form is replaced by a symplectic\n3-form. We show that, using the closure of the symplectic 3-form, a result\nanalogous to the classical Lie-Darboux theorem holds: locally, there exist\nsmooth coordinates such that the components of the symplectic 3-form are\nconstants, and the phase space is endowed with a preserved volume element.\nFurthermore, as in the classical theory, the Jacobi identity for the\ngeneralized Poisson bracket mathematically expresses the closure of the\nassociated symplectic form. As a consequence, constant skew-symmetric third\norder contravariant tensors always define generalized Poisson brackets. This is\nin contrast with generalizations of Hamiltonian mechanics postulating the\nfundamental identity as replacement for the Jacobi identity. In particular, we\nfind that the fundamental identity represents a stronger requirement than the\nclosure of the symplectic 3-form.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Dec 2020 09:48:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-22"}

In analyzing\nrandomized experiments, the traditional approach has been based on the Stable\nUnit Treatment Value (SUTVA: \\cite{rubin}) assumption which dictates that there\nis no interference between individuals. However, the SUTVA assumption fails to\nhold in many applications due to social interaction, general equilibrium,\nand/or externality effects. While much progress has been made in relaxing the\nSUTVA assumption, most of this literature has only considered a setting with\nperfect compliance to treatment assignment. In practice, however, noncompliance\noccurs frequently where the actual treatment receipt is different from the\nassignment to the treatment. In this paper, we study causal effects in\nrandomized experiments with network interference and noncompliance. Spillovers\nare allowed to occur at both treatment choice stage and outcome realization\nstage. In particular, we explicitly model treatment choices of agents as a\nbinary game of incomplete information where resulting equilibrium treatment\nchoice probabilities affect outcomes of interest. Outcomes are further\ncharacterized by a random coefficient model to allow for general unobserved\nheterogeneity in the causal effects. After defining our causal parameters of\ninterest, we propose a simple control function estimator and derive its\nasymptotic properties under large-network asymptotics.

We here propose a very simple stochastic\ninteraction at encounters that leads to agreement or geometric alignment in\nswarms of simple agents, and analyse the process of converging to consensus.\nConsider a group of agents whose \"states\" evolve in time by pairwise\ninteractions: the state of an agent is either a real value (a randomly\ninitialised position within an interval) or a vector that is either\nunconstrained (e.g. the location of the agent in the plane) or constrained to\nhave unit length (e.g. the direction of the agent's motion).

Given the current fast GANs development,\nin this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of adversarial models for\nimage synthesis.

We present milestones of adversarial models, review an extensive\nselection of previous works in various categories, and present insights on the\ndevelopment route from the model-based to data-driven methods.

Because of its fundamental status, this principle could be\na very powerful guide in formulating physical laws at regimes where both\ngravitational and quantum effects are relevant. However, its formulation\nimplicitly presupposes that reference frames are abstracted from classical\nsystems (rods and clocks) and that the spacetime background is well defined. It\nis unclear if it continues to hold when quantum systems, which can be in a\nquantum relationship with other physical systems, are taken as reference\nframes, and in a superposition of classical spacetime structures. Here, we\ntackle both questions by introducing a relational formalism to describe quantum\nsystems in a superposition of curved spacetimes. We build a unitary\ntransformation to the quantum reference frame (QRF) of a quantum system in\ncurved spacetime, and in a superposition thereof. In both cases, a QRF can be\nfound such that the metric looks locally minkowskian. Hence, one cannot\ndistinguish, with a local measurement, if the spacetime is flat or curved, or\nin a superposition of such spacetimes. This transformation identifies a Quantum\nLocal Inertial Frame. We also find a spacetime path-integral encoding the\ndynamics of a quantum particle in spacetime and show that the state of a freely\nfalling particle can be expressed as an infinite sum of all possible classical\ngeodesics. We then build the QRF transformation to the Fermi normal coordinates\nof such freely falling quantum particle and show that the metric is locally\nminkowskian. These results extend the Principle of Equivalence to QRFs in a\nsuperposition of gravitational fields. Verifying this principle may pave a\nfruitful path to establishing solid conceptual grounds for a future theory of\nquantum gravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Dec 2020 14:56:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Mar 2021 11:37:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 13 May 2022 18:49:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-17"}

Specifically,\njob dispatchers are implemented on access points (APs) which collect jobs from\nmobile users and distribute each job to a server at the edge or the cloud. A\nsignaling mechanism with periodic broadcast is introduced to facilitate\ncooperation among APs. The transmission latency is non-negligible in MAN, which\nleads to outdated information sharing among APs. Moreover, the fully-observed\nsystem state is discouraged as reception of all broadcast is time consuming.\nTherefore, we formulate the distributed optimization of job dispatching\nstrategies among the APs as a Markov decision process with partial and outdated\nsystem state, i.e., partially observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). The\nconventional solution for POMDP is impractical due to huge time complexity. We\npropose a novel low-complexity solution framework for distributed job\ndispatching, based on which the optimization of job dispatching policy can be\ndecoupled via an alternative policy iteration algorithm, so that the\ndistributed policy iteration of each AP can be made according to partial and\noutdated observation. A theoretical performance lower bound is proved for our\napproximate MDP solution. Furthermore, we conduct extensive simulations based\non the Google Cluster trace. The evaluation results show that our policy can\nachieve as high as $20.67\\%$ reduction in average job response time compared\nwith heuristic baselines, and our algorithm consistently performs well under\nvarious parameter settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Dec 2020 15:03:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-29"}

In this paper, we provide a\nfield-theoretical approach towards a complete list of mutually compatible\nbraiding phases of topological orders in (3+1)D spacetime. More concretely,\nconsidering a discrete gauge group as input data, topological excitations in\nthis paper are bosonic \\particles carrying gauge charges and loops carrying\ngauge fluxes. Among these excitations, there are three classes of root braiding\nprocesses: particle-loop braidings (i.e., the familiar Aharonov-Bohm phase of\nwinding an electric charge around a thin magnetic solenoid), multi-loop\nbraidings [Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 080403 (2014)], and particle-loop-loop\nbraidings [i.e., Borromean Rings braiding in Phys. Rev. Lett. 121, 061601\n(2018)]. A naive way to exhaust all topological orders is to arbitrarily\ncombine these root braiding processes. Surprisingly, we find that there exist\nillegitimate combinations in which certain braiding phases cannot coexist,\ni.e., are mutually incompatible. Thus, the resulting topological orders are\nillegitimate and must be excluded. It is not obvious to identify these\nillegitimate combinations. But with the help of the powerful (3+1)D topological\nquantum field theories (TQFTs), we find that illegitimate combinations violate\ngauge invariance.

First, to obtain low\nbit-width weights, most existing methods obtain the quantized weights by\nperforming quantization on the full-precision network weights. However, this\napproach would result in some mismatch: the gradient descent updates\nfull-precision weights, but it does not update the quantized weights. To\naddress this issue, we propose a novel method that enables {direct} updating of\nquantized weights {with learnable quantization levels} to minimize the cost\nfunction using gradient descent.

To address\nthis issue, we propose a method to take into account the quantization errors of\nindividual channels.

However,\nprogramming applications to directly manipulate NVM data is complex and\nerror-prone. Applications generally employ libraries that hide the low-level\ndetails of the hardware and provide a transactional programming model to\nachieve crash-consistency. Furthermore, applications continue to expect\ncorrectness during concurrent executions, achieved through the use of\nsynchronization. To achieve this, applications seek well-known ACID guarantees.\nHowever, realizing this presents designers of transactional systems with a\nrange of choices in how to combine several low-level techniques, given target\nhardware features and workload characteristics.\n  In this paper, we provide a comprehensive evaluation of the impact of\ncombining existing crash-consistency and synchronization methods for achieving\nperformant and correct NVM transactional systems. We consider different\nhardware characteristics, in terms of support for hardware transactional memory\n(HTM) and the boundaries of the persistence domain (transient or persistent\ncaches). By characterizing persistent transactional systems in terms of their\nproperties, we make it possible to better understand the tradeoffs of different\nimplementations and to arrive at better design choices for providing ACID\nguarantees. We use both real hardware with Intel Optane DC persistent memory\nand simulation to evaluate a persistent version of hardware transactional\nmemory, a persistent version of software transactional memory, and undo/redo\nlogging. Through our empirical study, we show two major factors that impact the\ncost of supporting persistence in transactional systems: the persistence domain\n(transient or persistent caches) and application characteristics, such as\ntransaction size and parallelism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Dec 2020 03:28:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-01"}

These characteristics include melodic rules, like where\nto stop and for how long, when to merge two letters in pronunciation or when to\nstretch some, or even when to put more strength on some letters over other.\nMost of the papers focus mainly on the main recitation rules and the\npronunciation but not (Ahkam AL Tajweed) which give different rhythm and\ndifferent melody to the pronunciation with every different rule of (Tajweed).\nWhich is also considered very important and essential in Reading the Quran as\nit can give different meanings to the words. In this paper we discuss in detail\nfull system for automatic recognition of Quran Recitation Rules (Tajweed) by\nusing support vector machine and threshold scoring system\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Dec 2020 11:24:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-13"}

In this work, ITO powder has been prepared utilizing\nsolid-state reaction methods. An electron beam gun technology has been used to\nprepare a ITO film (325 nm). The ITO window layer has been investigated at\nvarious temperatures. The effects of absolute temperature on the structural,\noptical, and electrical properties of the prepared ITO thin film layer are\ninvestigated. The energy band type corresponding to the orbital transitions has\nbeen determined, and the energies of the orbital transitions have been\ncalculated in the Tauc region, HOMO/LUMO gap, and charge transfer gap. In\nadditions, the exciton and Urbach energies have been computed. It has been\nfound that these energies increase with increasing the annealing temperature,\nexcept for Urbach's energies which behave differently. Thin-film quality\ncoefficient, surface resistance, and thermal emission in addition to the angle\nof refraction as a function of wavelength, have been determined.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Dec 2020 04:20:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-16"}
