Using mid-IR data in\ncombination with dust models, we find that high temperature (4250-4500 K), high\nextinction (E(B-V)>0.7) solutions are incompatible with the data. We therefore\nfavour a cool (~3500-3700 K) progenitor with a luminosity of log(L/Lsun)~4.53.\nComparing with evolutionary tracks, we infer progenitor masses in the 8-10 Msun\nrange in agreement with some previous studies. This mass is consistent with the\nobserved pattern of low-luminosity Type IIP SNe coming from the explosion of\nRSGs at the lower extremum for core-collapse.

The refactoring of systems for execution on such platforms\nis highly desired but also difficult to perform, mainly due the inherent\nincrease in software complexity. After exploration, we have identified a\ncurrent need for a systematic approach that supports engineers in the\nrefactoring process -- from CPU-centric applications to software that is\nexecuted on heterogeneous platforms. In this paper, we introduce a decision\nframework that assists engineers in the task of refactoring software to\nincorporate heterogeneous platforms.

In\naddition, many of the current methods fail to address the uncertainty in the\nlinkage, which may result in overly precise estimates of relationships between\nvariables that are exclusive to one of the files. Bayesian methods for record\nlinkage can reduce the bias in the estimation of scientific relationships of\ninterest and provide interval estimates that account for the uncertainty in the\nlinkage; however, implementation of these methods can often be complex and\ncomputationally intensive. This article presents the gfs_sampler package for\nthe Python programming language that utilizes a Bayesian approach for file\nlinkage. The linking procedure implemented in gfs_sampler samples from the\njoint posterior distribution of model parameters and the linking permutations.\nThe algorithm approaches file linkage as a missing data problem and generates\nmultiple linked data sets. For computational efficiency, only the linkage\npermutations are stored and multiple analyses are performed using each of the\npermutations separately. This implementation reduces the computational\ncomplexity of the linking process and the expertise required of researchers\nanalyzing linked data sets.

They are very large which makes it necessary to break each image down\ninto smaller patches for analysis, image features have to be extracted at\nmultiple scales in order to capture both detail and context, and extreme class\nimbalances may exist. Significant progress has been made in the analysis of\nthese images, thanks largely due to the availability of public annotated\ndatasets. We postulate, however, that even if a method scores well on a\nchallenge task, this success may not translate to good performance in a more\nclinically relevant workflow. Many datasets consist of image patches which may\nsuffer from data curation bias; other datasets are only labelled at the whole\nslide level and the lack of annotations across an image may mask erroneous\nlocal predictions so long as the final decision is correct. In this paper, we\noutline the differences between patch or slide-level classification versus\nmethods that need to localize or segment cancer accurately across the whole\nslide, and we experimentally verify that best practices differ in both cases.\nWe apply a binary cancer detection network on post neoadjuvant therapy breast\ncancer WSIs to find the tumor bed outlining the extent of cancer, a task which\nrequires sensitivity and precision across the whole slide. We extensively study\nmultiple design choices and their effects on the outcome, including\narchitectures and augmentations. Furthermore, we propose a negative data\nsampling strategy, which drastically reduces the false positive rate (7% on\nslide level) and improves each metric pertinent to our problem, with a 15%\nreduction in the error of tumor extent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2020 16:37:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-02"}

Successful solutions have many applications in human tracking, HCI, and\ngraphics. Most previous work focuses on predicting a time series of future 3D\njoint locations given a sequence 3D joints from the past. This Euclidean\nformulation generally works better than predicting pose in terms of joint\nrotations. Body joint locations, however, do not fully constrain 3D human pose,\nleaving degrees of freedom undefined, making it hard to animate a realistic\nhuman from only the joints. Note that the 3D joints can be viewed as a sparse\npoint cloud. Thus the problem of human motion prediction can be seen as point\ncloud prediction. With this observation, we instead predict a sparse set of\nlocations on the body surface that correspond to motion capture markers. Given\nsuch markers, we fit a parametric body model to recover the 3D shape and pose\nof the person. These sparse surface markers also carry detailed information\nabout human movement that is not present in the joints, increasing the\nnaturalness of the predicted motions. Using the AMASS dataset, we train MOJO,\nwhich is a novel variational autoencoder that generates motions from latent\nfrequencies. MOJO preserves the full temporal resolution of the input motion,\nand sampling from the latent frequencies explicitly introduces high-frequency\ncomponents into the generated motion. We note that motion prediction methods\naccumulate errors over time, resulting in joints or markers that diverge from\ntrue human bodies. To address this, we fit SMPL-X to the predictions at each\ntime step, projecting the solution back onto the space of valid bodies. These\nvalid markers are then propagated in time. Experiments show that our method\nproduces state-of-the-art results and realistic 3D body animations.

We have compared both ensemble and\ndynamic variants to identify an efficient approach. The results obtained show\nthat even the best State-of-the-Art models can be bettered. Thus showing us\nthat meta-embeddings can be used for several NLP tasks by harnessing the power\nof several individual representations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2020 16:58:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-02"}

We\nthen propose to assign different weights for updating the global model based on\nnode contribution adaptively through each training round. The contribution of\nparticipating nodes is first measured by the angle between the local gradient\nvector and the global gradient vector, and then, weight is quantified by a\ndesigned non-linear mapping function subsequently.

One of the major challenges in performing\nsubmillimeter dMRI is the inherently low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). While\napproaches capable of mitigating the low SNR in high resolution dMRI have been\nproposed, namely simultaneous multi-slab (SMSlab) and generalized slice\ndithered enhanced resolution with simultaneous multislice (gSlider-SMS),\nlimitations are associated with these approaches. The SMSlab sequences suffer\nfrom the slab boundary artifacts and require additional navigators for phase\nestimation. On the other hand, gSlider sequences require relatively high RF\npower and peak amplitude, which increase the SAR and complicate the RF\nexcitation. In this work, we developed a navigator-free multishot-encoded\nsimultaneous multi-slice (MUSIUM) imaging approach on a 3T MR scanner,\nachieving enhanced SNR, low RF power and peak amplitude, and being free from\nslab boundary artifacts. The dMRI with ultrahigh resolution (0.86 mm isotropic\nresolution), whole brain coverage and ~12.5 minute acquisition time were\nachieved, revealing detailed structures at cortical and white matter areas.

Moreover, the ratio of power in the patches is inversed once\nwithin the profile window. It is shown that the meridional circularization is\ncaused by a coherent OPM transition (COMT) produced by a varying mode ratio at\na fixed quarter-wave phase lag. The COMTs may be ubiquitous and difficult to\ndetect in radio pulsar data, because they can leave no trace in polarized\nfractions and they are described by equation similar to the rotating vector\nmodel. The circularization, which coincides with flux minima at lower\nfrequency, requires that profile components are formed by radiation with an\noscillation phase which increases with longitude in steps of 90 degrees per\ncomponent. The properties can be understood as an interference pattern\ninvolving two pairs of linear orthogonal modes (or two nonorthogonal elliptic\nwaves). The frequency-dependent coherent superposition of coplanar oscillations\ncan produce the minima in the pulse profile, and thereby the illusion of\ncomponents as separate entities.

Our assumption is that the data in both modalities are complex,\nstructured, and high dimensional (e.g., image and text), for which the\nconventional deep auto-encoding latent variable models such as the Variational\nAutoencoder (VAE) often suffer from difficulty of accurate decoder training or\nrealistic synthesis. A suboptimally trained decoder can potentially harm the\nmodel's capability of identifying the true factors. In this paper we propose a\nnovel idea of the implicit decoder, which completely removes the ambient data\ndecoding module from a latent variable model, via implicit encoder inversion\nthat is achieved by Jacobian regularization of the low-dimensional embedding\nfunction. Motivated from the recent Identifiable VAE (IVAE) model, we modify it\nto incorporate the query modality data as conditioning auxiliary input, which\nallows us to prove that the true parameters of the model can be identified\nunder some regularity conditions. Tested on various datasets where the true\nfactors are fully/partially available, our model is shown to identify the\nfactors accurately, significantly outperforming conventional encoder-decoder\nlatent variable models. We also test our model on the Recipe1M, the large-scale\nfood image/recipe dataset, where the learned factors by our approach highly\ncoincide with the most pronounced food factors that are widely agreed on,\nincluding savoriness, wateriness, and greenness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2020 17:47:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-02"}

We weave these two strands of research together,\nspecifically the tighter bounds of Monte-Carlo objectives and constraints on\nthe mutual information between the observable and the latent variables.\nEstimating the mutual information as the average Kullback-Leibler divergence\nbetween the easily available variational posterior $q(z|x)$ and the prior does\nnot work with Monte-Carlo objectives because $q(z|x)$ is no longer a direct\napproximation to the model's true posterior $p(z|x)$. Hence, we construct\nestimators of the Kullback-Leibler divergence of the true posterior from the\nprior by recycling samples used in the objective, with which we train models of\ncontinuous and discrete latents at much improved rate-distortion and no\nposterior collapse. While alleviated, the tradeoff between modelling the data\nand using the latents still remains, and we urge for evaluating inference\nmethods across a range of mutual information values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2020 18:14:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 May 2022 06:49:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-10"}

We provide explicit formulas for the eigenvectors and\neigenvalues of the covariance matrix of the multivariate distribution of these\nstatistics. Our techniques include and elaborate on a set of algebraic word\noperators, recently studied and employed by Dieker and Saliola (Adv Math,\n2018).\n  Subword counts find applications in Combinatorics, Statistics, and Computer\nScience. We revisit special cases from the combinatorial literature, such as\nintransitive dice, random core partitions, and questions on random walk. Our\nstructural approach describes in a unified framework several classical\nstatistical tests. We propose further potential applications to data analysis\nand machine learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2020 18:59:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Dec 2020 16:29:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-04"}

The ring is interpreted as the inner rim\nof an equatorial dust disk viewed from an inclination angle of ~50 degrees, and\nits axis is approximately aligned with the bipolar nebula. The disk is\nsurprisingly compact, with an inner radius of a mere 3.5 Rstar (2 au). Our 2-D\nradiative transfer modeling shows that an optically thick flared disk with\nsilicate grains as large as ~4 micron can reproduce the observed continuum\nimages and the spectral energy distribution. The images obtained in the CO\nfirst overtone bands reveal elongated extended emission around the central\nstar, suggesting the oblateness of the star's atmosphere or the presence of a\nCO gas disk inside the dust cavity. The object is unresolved with\nSPHERE-ZIMPOL, NACO, and VISIR. If the disk formed together with the bipolar\nnebula, the grain growth from sub-micron to a few microns should have taken\nplace over the nebula's dynamical age of ~3900 yrs. The non-detection of a\ncompanion in the reconstructed images implies that either its 2.2 micron\nbrightness is more than ~30 times lower than that of the red giant or it might\nhave been shredded due to binary interaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2020 19:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-03"}

We propose to observe\nEW restoration in double EW boson production via the convergence of the\nGoldstone boson equivalence theorem. This convergence is most easily measured\nin the vector boson plus Higgs production, $Vh$, which is dominated by the\nlongitudinal polarizations.

A recent analysis of a cluster sample at $z=1.13-1.75$ confirmed\nindications from previous studies of lower-redshift clusters, that the DTD has\na power-law form, ${\\rm DTD}(t)=R_1 (t/{\\rm Gyr})^\\alpha$, with amplitude\n$R_1$, at delay $t=1~\\rm Gyr$, several times higher than measured in\nfield-galaxy environments.

Herein, we propose a seven-step method that aims to determine CDL\nreliably by scan rate-dependent cyclic voltammetry. The method considers three\naspects that strongly influence the outcome of the analysis: measurement\nsettings, data collection, and data processing. To illustrate the proposed\nmethod, two systems were studied: a resistor-capacitor electric circuit and a\nglassy carbon disk in an electrochemical cell. With these studies it is\ndemonstrated that when any of the mentioned aspects of the procedure are\nneglected, substantial deviations of the results are observed with\nmisestimations as large as 61% in the case of the investigated electrochemical\nsystem.

The most popular mechanism aimed to explain the dynamics of\nthe nascent solar wind, including its heating and acceleration is\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. Most of the previous models focus on\nnonlinear cascade induced by interactions of outgoing Alfv\\'en waves and their\nreflections, ignoring effects that might be related to perpendicular\nstructuring of the solar coronal plasma, despite overwhelming evidence for it.\nIn this paper, for the first time, we analyse through 3D MHD numerical\nsimulations the dynamics of the perpendicularly structured solar corona and\nsolar wind, from the low corona to 15 R_Sun. We find that background\nstructuring has a strong effect on the evolution of MHD turbulence, on much\nfaster time scales than in the perpendicularly homogeneous case. On time scales\nshorter than nonlinear times, linear effects related to phase mixing result in\na 1/f perpendicular energy spectrum. As the turbulent cascade develops, we\nobserve a perpendicular (parallel) energy spectrum with the power law index of\n-3/2 or -5/3 (-2), a steeper perpendicular magnetic field than velocity\nspectrum, and a strong build-up of negative residual energy. We conclude that\nthe turbulence is most probably generated by the self-cascade of the driven\ntransverse kink waves, referred to previously as `uniturbulence', which might\nrepresent the dominant nonlinear energy cascade channel in the pristine solar\nwind.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2020 20:11:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-17"}

In contrast to most existing works which\neither align the data distributions or learn domain-invariant features, we\ndirectly learn a unified classifier for both domains within a high-dimensional\nhomogeneous feature space without explicit domain adaptation. To this end, we\nemploy the effective Selective Pseudo-Labelling (SPL) techniques to take\nadvantage of the unlabelled samples in the target domain. Surprisingly, data\ndistribution discrepancy across the source and target domains can be well\nhandled by a computationally simple classifier (e.g., a shallow Multi-Layer\nPerceptron) trained in the original feature space. Besides, we propose a novel\ngenerative model norm-VAE to generate synthetic features for the target domain\nas a data augmentation strategy to enhance classifier training. Experimental\nresults on several benchmark datasets demonstrate the pseudo-labelling strategy\nitself can lead to comparable performance to many state-of-the-art methods\nwhilst the use of norm-VAE for feature augmentation can further improve the\nperformance in most cases.

In this regard,\nOpportunistic Routing (OR), which utilizes the broadcast nature of wireless\nmedia to provide transmission cooperation amongst a selected number of\noverhearing nodes, has become more promising than ever. Crucial to the overall\nnetwork performance, which nodes to participate and where they stand on the\ntransmission-priority hierarchy, are decided by user-defined OR metrics\nembedded in OR protocols. Therefore, the task of choosing or designing an\nappropriate OR metric is a critical one. The numerousness, proprietary\nnotations, and the objective variousness of OR metrics can cause the interested\nresearcher to lose insight and become overwhelmed, making the metric selection\nor design effort-intensive.

Given the debilitating effect\nof cybersickness on the user experience in VR, academic interest in the\nautomatic detection of cybersickness from physiological measurements has\ncrested in recent years. Electroencephalography (EEG) has been extensively used\nto capture changes in electrical activity in the brain and to automatically\nclassify cybersickness from brainwaves using a variety of machine learning\nalgorithms. Recent advances in deep learning (DL) algorithms and increasing\navailability of computational resources for DL have paved the way for a new\narea of research into the application of DL frameworks to EEG-based detection\nof cybersickness. Accordingly, this review involved a systematic review of the\npeer-reviewed papers concerned with the application of DL frameworks to the\nclassification of cybersickness from EEG signals.

Here we show that the competition between intra- and\nintermolecular bonds at finite concentration is governed by a delicate balance\nof various entropic contributions and leads to a density dependent effective\nvalence. System-spanning networks are formed at relatively low monomer\ndensities and their stability is mediated by just a small number of\nintermolecular connections per chain. The formation of intermolecular bonds\nfurthermore can induce a non-monotonic dependence of the polymer size on the\ndensity for long bond lifetimes. Concomitantly, the polymers in the percolating\ncluster adopt an intramolecular structure characteristic for self-avoiding\nchains, which constitutes a strong contrast to the fractal globular behavior of\nirreversible SCNPs in crowded solutions with purely topological interactions\n(no intermolecular bonds). Finally, we study the dynamics of the system, which\ndisplays signatures expected for reversible gel-forming systems. An interesting\nbehavior emerges in the reorganization dynamics of the percolating cluster. The\nrelaxation is mostly mediated by the diffusion over long distances, through\nbreaking and formation of bonds, of chains that do not leave the percolating\ncluster. Regarding the few chains that are transiently free, the time they\nspend until they reattach to the cluster is solely governed by the bond\nstrength.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2020 22:00:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-15"}

With the prevalence of cyber-attacks on them,\nmeasuring their robustness has become an important issue. To date, many\nrobustness metrics have been proposed. It is desirable for a robustness metric\nto possess the following three properties: considering global network\ntopologies, strictly increasing upon link additions, and having a quadratic\ncomplexity in terms of the number of nodes on sparse networks. This paper\nproposes to use Average Network Flow (ANF) as a robustness metric, and proves\nthat it increases strictly, and gives an algorithm to compute ANF with a\nquadratic complexity by leveraging Gomory-Hu trees. Thus, with ANF\nintrinsically considering global network topologies, ANF is unveiled to be a\nnew robustness metric satisfying those three properties. Moreover, this paper\ncompares ANF with seven existing representative metrics, showing that each\nmetric has its own characteristics, so there is no silver bullet in measuring\nnetwork robustness and it is recommended to apply several metrics together to\ngain a comprehensive view. Finally, by experimenting on the scenarios in which\nnetwork topologies preserve the same numbers of nodes and links, some\ninteresting behaviors of robustness metrics are reported.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2020 22:48:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 2021 04:11:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-05"}

The system employs a\nplasmonic spectral encoder chip containing 252 different tiles of nanohole\narrays fabricated using a scalable and low-cost imprint lithography method,\nwhere each tile has a unique geometry and, thus, a unique optical transmission\nspectrum. The illumination spectrum of interest directly impinges upon the\nplasmonic encoder, and a CMOS image sensor captures the transmitted light,\nwithout any lenses, gratings, or other optical components in between, making\nthe entire hardware highly compact, light-weight and field-portable.

The main\nreason is that the leading methods employ time-consuming 3D convolutions\napplied to a 4D feature volume. A common way to speed up the computation is to\ndownsample the feature volume, but this loses high-frequency details. To\novercome these challenges, we propose a \\emph{displacement-invariant cost\ncomputation module} to compute the matching costs without needing a 4D feature\nvolume. Rather, costs are computed by applying the same 2D convolution network\non each disparity-shifted feature map pair independently. Unlike previous 2D\nconvolution-based methods that simply perform context mapping between inputs\nand disparity maps, our proposed approach learns to match features between the\ntwo images.

A non-monotonic change of photo-persistent cis ratio\nwith increasing temperature is observed accompanied by a reentrant\ncrystallization of trans below the melting temperature. A pseudo phase diagram\nis subsequently presented with varying temperature and light intensity along\nwith the resulting actuation strain. These insights can assist the further\ndevelopment of these materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2020 00:08:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2021 16:12:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 1 Mar 2021 20:29:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-24"}

The\nscientific goal is to reveal the physical/chemical properties of molecular\nclouds in the Galaxy by obtaining large-scale distributions of molecular gas\nwith an angular resolution of several arcminutes. A semi-automatic observation\nsystem created mainly in Python on Linux-PCs enables effective operations. A\nlarge-scale CO $J=$2--1 survey of the molecular clouds (e.g., Orion-A/B,\nCygnus-X/OB7, Taurus-California-Perseus complex, and Galactic Plane), and a\npilot survey of emission lines from minor molecular species toward Orion clouds\nhave been conducted so far. The telescope also is providing the opportunities\nfor technical demonstrations of new devices and ideas. For example, the\npractical realizations of PLM (Path Length Modulator) and waveguide-based\nsideband separating filter, installation of the newly designed waveguide-based\ncircular polarizer and OMT (Orthomode Transducer), and so on. As the next step,\nwe are now planning to relocate the telescope to San Pedro de Atacama in Chile\n(altitude 2500 m), and are developing very wideband receiver covering 210--375\nGHz (corresponding to Bands 6--7 of ALMA) and full-automatic observation\nsystem. The new telescope system will provide large-scale data in the spatial\nand frequency domain of molecular clouds of Galactic plane and Large/Small\nMagellanic Clouds at the southern hemisphere. The data will be precious for the\ncomparison with those of extra-galactic ones that will be obtained with ALMA as\nthe Bands 6/7 are the most efficient frequency bands for the surveys in\nextra-galaxies for ALMA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2020 00:21:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-03"}

Hence,\nthe perturbations are redundant, which are easily detected by human eyes. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel method to generate local region perturbations.\nThe main idea is to find a contributing feature region (CFR) of an image by\nsimulating the human attention mechanism and then add perturbations to CFR.\nFurthermore, a soft mask matrix is designed on the basis of an activation map\nto finely represent the contributions of each pixel in CFR. With this soft\nmask, we develop a new loss function with inverse temperature to search for\noptimal perturbations in CFR. Due to the network explanations, the\nperturbations added to CFR are more effective than those added to other\nregions.

Such an approach does not achieve optimal latency on\ncomplex and deep CNNs. Emerging CNNs have diverse per-layer computation\ncharacteristics including parallelism, arithmetic intensity, locality, and\nmemory footprint. Per-layer strategy selection and fine-grained tuning are\nrequired to achieve low end-to-end latency. However, specialized hardware\nmodules dedicated to each layer limit the per-layer utilization and adversely\naffect end-to-end latency. In this paper, we address these problems by an\nalgorithm-architecture co-optimization framework, DYNAMAP, consisting of (1) a\nunified hardware overlay that can be reused across layers, supporting dynamic\nmapping of all three families of popular convolution algorithms, and further\nallowing flexible dataflow switching to maximize hardware utilization for each\nlayer; (2) a novel software Design Space Exploration (DSE) flow that customizes\nthe hardware overlay and chooses optimal strategy mapping. We show that the\nalgorithm mapping space increases exponentially with network depth, and while\nthe optimal algorithm selection problem is NP-hard in general, by exploiting\nthe series-parallel structure of CNN models, we demonstrate a polynomial-time\nsolution for optimal algorithm mapping. DYNAMAP is optimized for any CNN,\nincluding those having diverse computation and memory requirements across the\nlayers.

However, achieving the accuracy needed to\noutperform classical methods has been an outstanding challenge. Here, using\neighteen superconducting qubits, we provide an experimental blueprint for an\naccurate condensed-matter simulator and demonstrate how to probe fundamental\nelectronic properties. We benchmark the underlying method by reconstructing the\nsingle-particle band-structure of a one-dimensional wire. We demonstrate nearly\ncomplete mitigation of decoherence and readout errors and arrive at an accuracy\nin measuring energy eigenvalues of this wire with an error of ~0.01 rad,\nwhereas typical energy scales are of order 1 rad. Insight into this\nunprecedented algorithm fidelity is gained by highlighting robust properties of\na Fourier transform, including the ability to resolve eigenenergies with a\nstatistical uncertainty of 1e-4 rad. Furthermore, we synthesize magnetic flux\nand disordered local potentials, two key tenets of a condensed-matter system.\nWhen sweeping the magnetic flux, we observe avoided level crossings in the\nspectrum, a detailed fingerprint of the spatial distribution of local disorder.\nCombining these methods, we reconstruct electronic properties of the\neigenstates where we observe persistent currents and a strong suppression of\nconductance with added disorder. Our work describes an accurate method for\nquantum simulation and paves the way to study novel quantum materials with\nsuperconducting qubits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2020 01:42:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Jun 2021 14:10:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-14"}

To complete the missing\ninformation, lots of Low-Rank Tensor Completion (LRTC) methods have been\nproposed, most of which depend on the low-rank property of tensor data. In this\nway, the low-rank component of the original data could be recovered roughly.\nHowever, the shortcoming is that the detail information can not be fully\nrestored, no matter the Sum of the Nuclear Norm (SNN) nor the Tensor Nuclear\nNorm (TNN) based methods. On the contrary, in the field of signal processing,\nConvolutional Sparse Coding (CSC) can provide a good representation of the\nhigh-frequency component of the image, which is generally associated with the\ndetail component of the data. Nevertheless, CSC can not handle the\nlow-frequency component well. To this end, we propose two novel methods,\nLRTC-CSC-I and LRTC-CSC-II, which adopt CSC as a supplementary regularization\nfor LRTC to capture the high-frequency components. Therefore, the LRTC-CSC\nmethods can not only solve the missing value problem but also recover the\ndetails.

For\nimproving reflection removal, cascaded deep models have been usually adopted to\nestimate the transmission in a progressive manner. However, most existing\nmethods are still limited in exploiting the result in prior stage for guiding\ntransmission estimation. In this paper, we present a novel two-stage network\nwith reflection-aware guidance (RAGNet) for single image reflection removal\n(SIRR). To be specific, the reflection layer is firstly estimated due to that\nit generally is much simpler and is relatively easier to estimate.\nReflectionaware guidance (RAG) module is then elaborated for better exploiting\nthe estimated reflection in predicting transmission layer. By incorporating\nfeature maps from the estimated reflection and observation, RAG can be used (i)\nto mitigate the effect of reflection from the observation, and (ii) to generate\nmask in partial convolution for mitigating the effect of deviating from linear\ncombination hypothesis. A dedicated mask loss is further presented for\nreconciling the contributions of encoder and decoder features.

However, single-view counting is not applicable to\nlarge and wide scenes (e.g., public parks, long subway platforms, or event\nspaces) because a single camera cannot capture the whole scene in adequate\ndetail for counting, e.g., when the scene is too large to fit into the\nfield-of-view of the camera, too long so that the resolution is too low on\nfaraway crowds, or when there are too many large objects that occlude large\nportions of the crowd. Therefore, to solve the wide-area counting task requires\nmultiple cameras with overlapping fields-of-view. In this paper, we propose a\ndeep neural network framework for multi-view crowd counting, which fuses\ninformation from multiple camera views to predict a scene-level density map on\nthe ground-plane of the 3D world. We consider three versions of the fusion\nframework: the late fusion model fuses camera-view density map; the naive early\nfusion model fuses camera-view feature maps; and the multi-view multi-scale\nearly fusion model ensures that features aligned to the same ground-plane point\nhave consistent scales. A rotation selection module further ensures consistent\nrotation alignment of the features. We test our 3 fusion models on 3 multi-view\ncounting datasets, PETS2009, DukeMTMC, and a newly collected multi-view\ncounting dataset containing a crowded street intersection.

Since users' utilities are their private information, which they\nmay not be willing to share, a mediator, known as the planner, is introduced to\nhelp optimize the overall satisfaction of the community (total utility minus\ntotal payments) by mechanism design. A mechanism consists of a message space, a\ntax/subsidy and an allocation function for each user.

An attentive cost volume is built to\nassociate two point clouds and obtain embedding motion patterns.

This work presents a\nnew clinical corpus, referred to as the COVID-19 Annotated Clinical Text (CACT)\nCorpus, which comprises 1,472 notes with detailed annotations characterizing\nCOVID-19 diagnoses, testing, and clinical presentation. We introduce a\nspan-based event extraction model that jointly extracts all annotated\nphenomena, achieving high performance in identifying COVID-19 and symptom\nevents with associated assertion values (0.83-0.97 F1 for events and 0.73-0.79\nF1 for assertions). In a secondary use application, we explored the prediction\nof COVID-19 test results using structured patient data (e.g. vital signs and\nlaboratory results) and automatically extracted symptom information. The\nautomatically extracted symptoms improve prediction performance, beyond\nstructured data alone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2020 05:25:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 2021 21:36:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-12"}

To this end, we implement beam-tracking based on\ndeep reinforcement learning (DRL) to learn the complicated relationships\nbetween the historical positions/velocities and appropriate beam steering\nangles.

In\ngenerating SWC, the conventional wisdom is that the dynamical elements should\nbe coupled in a nonlocal fashion. For this reason, it is commonly believed that\nSWC is excluded from the general reaction-diffusion (RD) systems possessing\nonly local couplings. Here, by an experimentally feasible model of\nthree-component FitzHugh-Nagumo-type RD system, we demonstrate that, even\nthough the system elements are locally coupled, stable SWCs can still be\nobserved in a wide region in the parameter space. The properties of SWCs are\nexplored, and the underlying mechanisms are analyzed from the point view of\ncoupled oscillators. Transitions from SWC to incoherent states are also\ninvestigated, and it is found that SWCs are typically destabilized in two\nscenarios, namely core breakup and core expansion. The former is characterized\nby a continuous breakup of the single asynchronous core into a number of small\nasynchronous cores, whereas the latter is featured by the continuous expansion\nof the single asynchronous core to the whole space. Remarkably, in the scenario\nof core expansion, the system may develop into an intriguing state in which\nregular spiral waves are embedded in a completely disordered background. This\nstate, which is named shadowed spirals, manifests from a new perspective the\ncoexistence of incoherent and coherent states in spatiotemporal systems,\ngeneralizing therefore the traditional concept of chimera states. Our studies\nprovide an affirmative answer to the observation of SWCs in RD systems, and\npave a way to the realization of SWCs in experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2020 06:14:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-14"}

However, interpretation of MRI\nsuffers from high inter-observer variability across radiologists, thereby\ncontributing to missed clinically significant cancers, overdiagnosed low-risk\ncancers, and frequent false positives. Interpretation of MRI could be greatly\nimproved by providing radiologists with an answer key that clearly shows cancer\nlocations on MRI. Registration of histopathology images from patients who had\nradical prostatectomy to pre-operative MRI allows such mapping of ground truth\ncancer labels onto MRI. However, traditional MRI-histopathology registration\napproaches are computationally expensive and require careful choices of the\ncost function and registration hyperparameters. This paper presents ProsRegNet,\na deep learning-based pipeline to accelerate and simplify MRI-histopathology\nimage registration in prostate cancer. Our pipeline consists of image\npreprocessing, estimation of affine and deformable transformations by deep\nneural networks, and mapping cancer labels from histopathology images onto MRI\nusing estimated transformations. We trained our neural network using MR and\nhistopathology images of 99 patients from our internal cohort (Cohort 1) and\nevaluated its performance using 53 patients from three different cohorts (an\nadditional 12 from Cohort 1 and 41 from two public cohorts). Results show that\nour deep learning pipeline has achieved more accurate registration results and\nis at least 20 times faster than a state-of-the-art registration algorithm.\nThis important advance will provide radiologists with highly accurate prostate\nMRI answer keys, thereby facilitating improvements in the detection of prostate\ncancer on MRI.

Various methods have been\nproposed and successfully applied to multi-view learning, typically based on\nmatrix factorization models. Recently, it is extended to the deep structure to\nexploit the hierarchical information of multi-view data, but the view-specific\nfeatures and the label information are seldom considered. To address these\nconcerns, we present a partially shared semi-supervised deep matrix\nfactorization model (PSDMF). By integrating the partially shared deep\ndecomposition structure, graph regularization and the semi-supervised\nregression model, PSDMF can learn a compact and discriminative representation\nthrough eliminating the effects of uncorrelated information. In addition, we\ndevelop an efficient iterative updating algorithm for PSDMF.

It is\nwell-known that numerical band structure calculations typically provide\nelectronic wave functions with an undetermined k-dependent phase which results\nin matrix elements which contain arbitrary k-dependent phases. In addition,\nsuch approaches usually mix degenerate bands and bands with an energy\ndifference smaller than the numerical precision in an arbitrary way for each\npoint in k-space. These ambiguities are problematic if one considers the\ndynamics induced by electric fields since the matrix elements of the position\noperator involve a derivative of the wave functions with respect to k. When the\nlight-matter interaction is described in the length gauge, the problem of\narbitrary phases and degenerate subspace mixing of Bloch states is solved by\nadopting a smooth gauge transformation along the field direction. The results\nobtained within this method are validated by comparing with calculations in the\nvelocity gauge. Although we obtain in both gauges the same overall result, the\nlength gauge is advantageous since it converges with a smaller number of bands\nand thus requires significantly less numerical effort than the velocity gauge.\nAlso an unique distinction between inter- and intraband contributions and thus\nan instructive physical interpretation is possible in the length gauge whereas\nin the velocity gauge this is unclear. The computed\npolarization-direction-dependent high-harmonic spectra agree well with\nexperimental data reported for GaAs. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that,\nunder proper conditions, the Berry curvature is largely responsible for the\neven-order harmonics which are polarized perpendicular to the driving field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2020 07:00:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-10"}

The sp2 hybridized and thermodynamically\nstable form of carbon forms a layered structure with strong in-plane carbon\nbonds and weak inter-layer van der Waals bonding. Graphite is also a\nhigh-temperature ceramic, and shaping them into complex geometries is\nchallenging, given its limited sintering behavior even at high temperatures.\nAlthough the geometric design of the graphite structure in many of the\napplications could dictate its precision performance, conventional synthesis\nmethods for formulating complex geometric graphite shapes are limited due to\nthe intrinsic brittleness and difficulties of high-temperature processing.\nHere, we report the development of colloidal graphite ink from commercial\ngraphite powders with reproducible rheological behavior that allows the\nfabrication of any complex architectures with tunable geometry and\ndirectionality via 3D printing at room temperature. The method is enabled via\nusing small amounts of clay, another layered material, as an additive, allowing\nthe proper design of the graphene ink and subsequent binding of graphite\nplatelets during printing. Sheared layers of clay are easily able to flow,\nadapt, and interface with graphite layers forming strong binding between the\nlayers and between particles that make the larger structures. The direct ink\nprinting of complex 3D architectures of graphite without further heat\ntreatments could lead to easy shape engineering and related applications of\ngraphite at various length scales, including complex graphite molds or\ncrucibles. The 3D printed complex graphitic structures exhibit excellent\nthermal, electrical, and mechanical properties, and the clay additive does not\nseem to alter these properties due to the excellent inter-layer dispersion and\nmixing within the graphite material.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2020 07:01:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-03"}

As the one technique of dimensionality reduction, a stochastic\nneighbor embedding (SNE) was introduced. The SNE leads powerful results to\nvisualize high-dimensional data by considering the similarity between the local\nGaussian distributions of high and low-dimensional space. To improve the SNE, a\nt-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) was also introduced. To\nvisualize high-dimensional data, the t-SNE leads to more powerful and flexible\nvisualization on 2 or 3-dimensional mapping than the SNE by using a\nt-distribution as the distribution of low-dimensional data. Recently, Uniform\nmanifold approximation and projection (UMAP) is proposed as a dimensionality\nreduction technique. We present a novel technique called a q-Gaussian\ndistributed stochastic neighbor embedding (q-SNE). The q-SNE leads to more\npowerful and flexible visualization on 2 or 3-dimensional mapping than the\nt-SNE and the SNE by using a q-Gaussian distribution as the distribution of\nlow-dimensional data. The q-Gaussian distribution includes the Gaussian\ndistribution and the t-distribution as the special cases with q=1.0 and q=2.0.\nTherefore, the q-SNE can also express the t-SNE and the SNE by changing the\nparameter q, and this makes it possible to find the best visualization by\nchoosing the parameter q. We show the performance of q-SNE as visualization on\n2-dimensional mapping and classification by k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)\nclassifier in embedded space compared with SNE, t-SNE, and UMAP by using the\ndatasets MNIST, COIL-20, OlivettiFaces, FashionMNIST, and Glove.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2020 07:21:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-03"}

A smart\nsafeguard function should adapt the activation conditions to the driving\npolicy, to avoid unnecessary interventions as well as improve vehicle safety.\nThis paper proposes a driving-policy adaptive safeguard (DPAS) design,\nincluding a collision avoidance strategy and an activation function. The\ncollision avoidance strategy is designed in a reinforcement learning framework,\nobtained by Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). It can learn from past collisions\nand manipulate both braking and steering in stochastic traffics. The\ndriving-policy adaptive activation function should dynamically assess current\ndriving policy risk and kick in when an urgent threat is detected. To generate\nthis activation function, MCTS' exploration and rollout modules are designed to\nfully evaluate the AV's current driving policy, and then explore other safer\nactions. In this study, the DPAS is validated with two typical highway-driving\npolicies. The results are obtained through and 90,000 times in the stochastic\nand aggressive simulated traffic. The results are calibrated by naturalistic\ndriving data and show that the proposed safeguard reduces the collision rate\nsignificantly without introducing more interventions, compared with the\nstate-based benchmark safeguards. In summary, the proposed safeguard leverages\nthe learning-based method in stochastic and emergent scenarios and imposes\nminimal influence on the driving policy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2020 08:01:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-03"}

Given a user query (i.e., a natural\nlanguage description), code retrieval aims at searching for the most relevant\nones from a set of code snippets. The main challenge of effective code\nretrieval lies in mitigating the semantic gap between natural language\ndescriptions and code snippets. With the ever-increasing amount of available\nopen-source code, recent studies resort to neural networks to learn the\nsemantic matching relationships between the two sources.

Its applicability, however, is still very much limited, due in\nlarge part to the lack of efficient computational methods for calculating\nhigher-dimensional models. The high computational complexity shows itself\nespecially in the calculation of the imprecise version of the Kolmogorov\nbackward equation. The equation is represented at every point of an interval in\nthe form of a minimization problem, solvable merely with linear programming\ntechniques. Consequently, finding an exact solution on an entire interval is\ninfeasible, whence approximation approaches have been developed. To achieve\nsufficient accuracy, in general, the linear programming optimization methods\nneed to be used in a large number of time points.\n  The principal goal of this paper is to provide a new, more efficient approach\nfor solving the imprecise Kolmogorov backward equation. It is based on the\nLipschitz continuity of the solutions of the equation with respect to time,\ncausing the linear programming problems appearing in proximate points of the\ntime interval to have similar optimal solutions. This property is exploited by\nutilizing the theory of normal cones of convex sets. The present article is\nprimarily devoted to providing the theoretical basis for the novel technique,\nyet, the initial testing shows that in most cases it decisively outperforms the\nexisting methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2020 08:53:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-30"}

Existing models assume that the\nattack at node u causes damage only at u. However, in many real-world security\nscenarios, the attack at a node u spreads to the neighbors of u and can cause\ndamage at multiple nodes, e.g., for the outbreak of a virus. In this paper, we\nconsider the network defending problem against contagious attacks.\n  Existing works that study shared resources assume that the resource allocated\nto a node can be shared or duplicated between neighboring nodes. However, in\nreal world, sharing resource naturally leads to a decrease in defending power\nof the source node, especially when defending against contagious attacks. To\nthis end, we study the model in which resources allocated to a node can only be\ntransferred to its neighboring nodes, which we refer to as a reallocation\nprocess.\n  We show that this more general model is difficult in two aspects: (1) even\nfor a fixed allocation of resources, we show that computing the optimal\nreallocation is NP-hard; (2) for the case when reallocation is not allowed, we\nshow that computing the optimal allocation (against contagious attack) is also\nNP-hard. For positive results, we give a mixed integer linear program\nformulation for the problem and a bi-criteria approximation algorithm. Our\nexperimental results demonstrate that the allocation and reallocation\nstrategies our algorithm computes perform well in terms of minimizing the\ndamage due to contagious attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2020 09:13:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2020 05:54:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-10"}

Security analysis shows the\nPiPoMonitor can effectively mitigate cross-core attacks and the Auto-Cuckoo\nfilter is immune to reverse engineering attacks. Evaluation results indicate\nPiPoMonitor has negligible impact on performance and the storage overhead is\nonly 0.37$\\%$, an order of magnitude lower than previous stateful approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2020 09:30:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Dec 2020 08:13:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-08"}

From the machine learning\nperspective, online disease diagnosis is a sequential feature (symptom)\nselection and classification problem. Reinforcement learning (RL) methods are\nthe standard approaches to this type of tasks. Generally, they perform well\nwhen the feature space is small, but frequently become inefficient in tasks\nwith a large number of features, such as the self-diagnosis. To address the\nchallenge, we propose a non-RL Bipartite Scalable framework for Online Disease\ndiAgnosis, called BSODA. BSODA is composed of two cooperative branches that\nhandle symptom-inquiry and disease-diagnosis, respectively. The inquiry branch\ndetermines which symptom to collect next by an information-theoretic reward. We\nemploy a Product-of-Experts encoder to significantly improve the handling of\npartial observations of a large number of features. Besides, we propose several\napproximation methods to substantially reduce the computational cost of the\nreward to a level that is acceptable for online services. Additionally, we\nleverage the diagnosis model to estimate the reward more precisely. For the\ndiagnosis branch, we use a knowledge-guided self-attention model to perform\npredictions. In particular, BSODA determines when to stop inquiry and output\npredictions using both the inquiry and diagnosis models. We demonstrate that\nBSODA outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on several public datasets.\nMoreover, we propose a novel evaluation method to test the transferability of\nsymptom checking methods from synthetic to real-world tasks. Compared to\nexisting RL baselines, BSODA is more effectively scalable to large search\nspaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2020 10:12:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 29 May 2021 14:53:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 20 Jan 2022 07:10:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-21"}

Non-linear\nelectrodynamics, e.g., Born-Infeld (BI) electrodynamics, generalizes Maxwell's\ntheory in the strong field regime. Non-minimally coupling the BI field to the\nscalar field, we study spontaneous scalarization of an\nEinstein-Born-Infeld-scalar (EBIS) model in this paper. It shows that there are\ntwo types of scalarized black hole solutions, i.e., scalarized RN-like and\nSchwarzschild-like solutions. Although the behavior of scalarized RN-like\nsolutions in the EBIS model is quite similar to that of scalarize solutions in\nthe EMS model, we find that there exist significant differences between\nscalarized Schwarzschild-like solutions in the EBIS model and scalarized\nsolutions in the EMS model. In particular, the domain of existence of\nscalarized Schwarzschild-like solutions possesses a certain region, which is\ncomposed of two branches. The branch of larger horizon area is a family of\ndisconnected scalarized solutions, which do not bifurcate from scalar-free\nblack holes. However, the branch of smaller horizon area may or may not\nbifurcate from scalar-free black holes depending on the parameters.\nAdditionally, these two branches of scalarized solutions can be both\nentropically disfavored over comparable scalar-free black holes in some\nparameter region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2020 10:18:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 7 Feb 2021 09:21:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-19"}

Formal\nperturbation expansions of the Koopman operator allow us to derive general\nstochastic parametrizations of weakly coupled dynamical systems. Such\nparametrizations yield a set of stochastic integro-differential equations with\nexplicit noise and memory kernel formulas to describe the effects of unresolved\nvariables.

An essential aspect in the development of AVs is the assessment\nof quality and performance aspects of the AVs, such as safety, comfort, and\nefficiency. Among other methods, a scenario-based approach has been proposed.\nWith scenario-based testing, the AV is subjected to a collection of scenarios\nthat represent real-world situations.\n  The collection of scenarios needs to cover the variety of what an AV can\nencounter in real traffic. As a result, many different scenarios are\nconsidered, that are grouped into so-called scenario categories. We propose a\nmethod for defining the scenario categories using a system of tags, where each\ntag describes a particular characteristic of a scenario category.\n  There is a balance between having generic scenario categories - very specific\nset of scenarios, while for another system one might be interested in a set of\nscenarios with a high variety. To accommodate this, tags are structured in\ntrees. The different layers of the trees can be regarded as different\nabstraction levels.\n  Next to presenting the method for describing scenario categories using tags,\nwe will illustrate the method by showing applicable trees of tags using\nconcrete examples in the Singapore traffic system. Trees of tags are shown for\nthe vehicle under test, the dynamic environment (e.g., the other road users),\nthe static environment (e.g., the road layout), and the environmental\nconditions (weather and lighting conditions). Few examples are presented to\nillustrate the proposed method for defining the scenario categories using tags.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2020 11:10:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-03"}

An important paramter for assessing the viability of an RF WPT\nsystem is its end-to-end efficiency. In this regard, we present a prototype\ntest-bed comprising a software-defined radio (SDR) transmitter and an energy\nharvesting receiver with a low resistive load; employing an SDR makes our\nresearch meaningful for simultaneous wireless information and power transfer\n(SWIPT). We analyze the effect of clipping and non-linear amplification at the\nSDR on multisine waveforms. Our experiments suggest that when the DC input\npower at the transmitter is constant, high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR)\nmultisine are unsuitable for RF WPT over a flat-fading channel, due to their\nlow average radiated power. The results indicate that the end-to-end efficiency\nis positively correlated to the average RF power of the waveform, and that it\nreduces with increasing PAPR. Consequently, digital modulations such as\nphase-shift keying (PSK) and quadrature amplitude modeulation (QAM) yield\nbetter end-to-end efficiency than multisines. Moreover, the end-to-end\nefficiency of PSK and QAM signals is invariant of the transmission bit rate.

SAMI609396B, at redshift\n$z=0.018$, is a low-mass galaxy in a minor merger with intense star formation,\nanalogous to conditions at high redshifts. We use three methods to derive\ndirect metallicities and compare with strong-line diagnostics. The spatial\nmetallicity trends show significant differences among the three direct methods.\nOur first method is based on the commonly used electron temperature\n$T_e$([OIII]) from the [OIII]$\\lambda$4363 auroral line and a traditional\n$T_e$([OII]) -- $T_e$([OIII]) calibration. The second method applies a recent\nempirical correction to the O$^+$ abundance from the [OIII]/[OII] strong-line\nratio. The third method infers the $T_e$([OII]) from the\n[SII]$\\lambda\\lambda$4069,76 auroral lines. The first method favours a positive\nmetallicity gradient along SAMI609396B, whereas the second and third methods\nyield flattened gradients. Strong-line diagnostics produce mostly flat\ngradients, albeit with unquantified contamination from shocked regions. We\nconclude that overlooked assumptions about the internal temperature structure\nof HII regions in the direct method can lead to large discrepancies in\nmetallicity gradient studies.

In such cases, organizations need to deploy\nPrivacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs) to strike a balance between the benefits\nthey get from analyzing these data and the requirements imposed onto them by\nprivacy regulations, particularly that of minimizing re-identification risks\nwhen data are disclosed to a process analyst.

In the task offloading, the task is\ntransmitted to the VFC system according to the 802.11p standard and processed\nby the computation resources in the VFC system. The delay of task offloading,\nconsisting of the transmission delay and computing delay, is extremely critical\nespecially for some delay-sensitive applications.

Contrary to expectations, it is\nsuggested that the mica substrate surface is modified by sulfur evaporated from\nthe Sn2S3 contaminant in the as-purchased powder and the lateral growth of\nmonolayer SnS is facilitated due to the enhanced surface diffusion of SnS\nprecursor molecules, unlike the growth from the highly purified powder. This\ninsight provides a guide to identify further controllable growth conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2020 12:41:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-03"}

The wide variety of\ndocument types, alphabets, and formats makes binarization challenging. There\nare multiple proposals with which to solve this problem, from classical\nmanually-adjusted methods, to more recent approaches based on machine learning.\nThe latter techniques require a large amount of training data in order to\nobtain good results; however, labeling a portion of each existing collection of\ndocuments is not feasible in practice. This is a common problem in supervised\nlearning, which can be addressed by using the so-called Domain Adaptation (DA)\ntechniques. These techniques take advantage of the knowledge learned in one\ndomain, for which labeled data are available, to apply it to other domains for\nwhich there are no labeled data. This paper proposes a method that combines\nneural networks and DA in order to carry out unsupervised document\nbinarization. However, when both the source and target domains are very\nsimilar, this adaptation could be detrimental. Our methodology, therefore,\nfirst measures the similarity between domains in an innovative manner in order\nto determine whether or not it is appropriate to apply the adaptation process.\nThe results reported in the experimentation, when evaluating up to 20 possible\ncombinations among five different domains, show that our proposal successfully\ndeals with the binarization of new document domains without the need for\nlabeled data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2020 13:42:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Jul 2021 09:44:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-02"}

Recent\ndeep learning based methods tailored for face images have achieved improved\nperformance by jointly trained with additional task such as face parsing and\nlandmark prediction. However, multi-task learning requires extra manually\nlabeled data. Besides, most of the existing works can only generate relatively\nlow resolution face images (e.g., $128\\times128$), and their applications are\ntherefore limited. In this paper, we introduce a novel SPatial Attention\nResidual Network (SPARNet) built on our newly proposed Face Attention Units\n(FAUs) for face super-resolution. Specifically, we introduce a spatial\nattention mechanism to the vanilla residual blocks. This enables the\nconvolutional layers to adaptively bootstrap features related to the key face\nstructures and pay less attention to those less feature-rich regions. This\nmakes the training more effective and efficient as the key face structures only\naccount for a very small portion of the face image. Visualization of the\nattention maps shows that our spatial attention network can capture the key\nface structures well even for very low resolution faces (e.g., $16\\times16$).\nQuantitative comparisons on various kinds of metrics (including PSNR, SSIM,\nidentity similarity, and landmark detection) demonstrate the superiority of our\nmethod over current state-of-the-arts. We further extend SPARNet with\nmulti-scale discriminators, named as SPARNetHD, to produce high resolution\nresults (i.e., $512\\times512$). We show that SPARNetHD trained with synthetic\ndata cannot only produce high quality and high resolution outputs for\nsynthetically degraded face images, but also show good generalization ability\nto real world low quality face images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2020 13:54:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 2020 12:33:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}

Extending beyond these known properties, our\ndiagrammatic approach also allows us to analytically derive that the Berry\nphase of any finite-length 1D AKLT chain is $\\pi$. In addition, we provide an\nalternative proof that the 2D AKLT state on a hexagonal lattice can be reduced\nto a graph state, demonstrating that it is a universal quantum computing\nresource. Lastly, we build 2D higher-order topological phases diagrammatically,\nwhich we use to illustrate a symmetry-breaking phase transition. Our results\nshow that the ZXH-calculus is a powerful language for representing and\ncomputing with physical states entirely graphically, paving the way to develop\nmore efficient many-body algorithms and giving a novel diagrammatic perspective\non quantum phase transitions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2020 14:03:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Aug 2021 17:47:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 8 Dec 2021 09:31:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-11"}

A central challenge in the study of\nanion-ordered compounds lies in developing robust synthetic strategies to\ncontrol anion occupation and in understanding the resultant implications for\nelectronic structure. Here, we show that epitaxial strain induces preferential\noccupation of F and O on the anion sites in perovskite oxyfluoride SrMnO2.5-dFg\nfilms grown on different substrates. Under compressive strain, F tends to take\nthe apical-like sites, which was revealed by F and O K-edge linearly polarized\nx-ray absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations,\nresulting in an enhanced c-axis expansion.

The anion ordered oxyfluoride films exhibit a significant orbital\npolarization of the 3d electrons, distinct F-site dependence to their valence\nband density of states, and an enhanced resistivity when F occupies the\napical-like anion site compared to the equatorial-like site.

In these cases, it is sometimes\npossible to identify a surrogate outcome that can more easily/quickly/cheaply\ncapture the effect of interest. Theory and methods for evaluating the strength\nof surrogate markers have been well studied in the context of a single\nsurrogate marker measured in the course of a randomized clinical study.\nHowever, methods are lacking for quantifying the utility of surrogate markers\nwhen the dimension of the surrogate grows and/or when study data are\nobservational. We propose an efficient nonparametric method for evaluating\nhigh-dimensional surrogate markers in studies where the treatment need not be\nrandomized. Our approach draws on a connection between quantifying the utility\nof a surrogate marker and the most fundamental tools of causal inference --\nnamely, methods for estimating the average treatment effect. We show that\nrecently developed methods for incorporating machine learning methods into the\nestimation of average treatment effects can be used for evaluating surrogate\nmarkers.

Aims: The goal is to study convection,\ndifferential rotation, and dynamos as functions of rotation in fully convective\nstars. Methods: Three-dimensional hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic\nnumerical simulations with a star-in-a-box model, where a spherical star is\nimmersed inside of a Cartesian cube, are used. The model corresponds to a\n$0.2M_\\odot$ M5 dwarf. Rotation periods ($P_{\\rm rot}$) between 4.3 and 430\ndays are explored. Results: The slowly rotating model with $P_{\\rm rot}=430$\ndays produces anti-solar differential rotation with a slow equator and fast\npoles, along with predominantly axisymmetric quasi-steady large-scale magnetic\nfields. For intermediate rotation ($P_{\\rm rot}=144$ and $43$ days)\ndifferential rotation is solar-like (fast equator, slow poles) and large-scale\nmagnetic fields are mostly axisymmetric and either quasi-stationary or cyclic.\nThe latter occurs in a similar parameter regime as in other numerical studies\nin spherical shells, and the cycle period is similar to observed cycles in\nfully convective stars with comparable $P_{\\rm rot}$. In the rapid rotation\nregime the differential rotation is weak and the large-scale magnetic fields\nare increasingly non-axisymmetric with a dominating $m=1$ mode. This\nlarge-scale non-axisymmetric field also exhibits azimuthal dynamo waves.\nConclusions: The results of the star-in-a-box models agree with simulations of\npartially convective late-type stars in spherical shells in that the\ntransitions in differential rotation and dynamo regimes occur at similar\nrotational regimes in terms of the Coriolis (inverse Rossby) number. This\nsimilarity between partially and fully convective stars suggests that the\nprocesses generating differential rotation and large-scale magnetism are\ninsensitive to the geometry of the star.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2020 15:07:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 2021 09:00:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-14"}

We notice that training a teacher with\ntransferable knowledge digested across domains can achieve better\ngeneralization capability to help knowledge distillation. Hence we propose a\nMeta-Knowledge Distillation (Meta-KD) framework to build a meta-teacher model\nthat captures transferable knowledge across domains and passes such knowledge\nto students.

Our rationale behind using RL is to\ncircumvent the challenges of analytically modeling user mobility and network\ndynamics. To accomplish this joint optimization, we integrate vector rewards\ninto the RL value network and conduct RL action via a separate policy network.\nWe name this method as Pareto deterministic policy gradients (PDPG). It is an\nactor-critic, model-free and deterministic policy algorithm which can handle\nthe coupling objectives with the following two merits: 1) It solves the\noptimization via leveraging the degree of freedom of vector reward as opposed\nto choosing handcrafted scalar-reward; 2) Cross-validation over multiple\npolicies can be significantly reduced. Accordingly, the RL enabled network\nbehaves in a self-organized way: It learns out the underlying user mobility\nthrough measurement history to proactively operate handover and antenna tilt\nwithout environment assumptions. Our numerical evaluation demonstrates that the\nintroduced RL method outperforms scalar-reward based approaches. Meanwhile, to\nbe self-contained, an ideal static optimization based brute-force search solver\nis included as a benchmark. The comparison shows that the RL approach performs\nas well as this ideal strategy, though the former one is constrained with\nlimited environment observations and lower action frequency, whereas the latter\nones have full access to the user mobility. The convergence of our introduced\napproach is also tested under different user mobility environment based on our\nmeasurement data from a real scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2020 15:35:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-03"}

The controller of each subsystem observes its local state\nand the mean-field of the state of all subsystems. The system has a\nnon-classical information structure. Exploiting the symmetry of the problem, we\nidentify an information state and use that to obtain a dynamic programming\ndecomposition. This dynamic program determines a globally optimal strategy for\nall controllers. Our solution approach works for arbitrary number of\ncontrollers and generalizes to the setup when the mean-field is observed with\nnoise. The size of the information state is time-invariant; thus, the results\ngeneralize to the infinite-horizon control setups as well. In addition, when\nthe mean-field is observed without noise, the size of the corresponding\ninformation state increases polynomially (rather than exponentially) with the\nnumber of controllers which allows us to solve problems with moderate number of\ncontrollers. We illustrate our approach by an example motivated by smart grids\nthat consists of $100$ coupled subsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2020 08:59:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-04"}

FL shows an inherent\nadvantage in privacy preservation, since users' raw data are processed locally.\nHowever, it relies on a centralized server to perform model aggregation.\nTherefore, FL is vulnerable to server malfunctions and external attacks. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel framework by integrating blockchain into FL,\nnamely, blockchain assisted decentralized federated learning (BLADE-FL), to\nenhance the security of FL. The proposed BLADE-FL has a good performance in\nterms of privacy preservation, tamper resistance, and effective cooperation of\nlearning. However, it gives rise to a new problem of training deficiency,\ncaused by lazy clients who plagiarize others' trained models and add artificial\nnoises to conceal their cheating behaviors. To be specific, we first develop a\nconvergence bound of the loss function with the presence of lazy clients and\nprove that it is convex with respect to the total number of generated blocks\n$K$. Then, we solve the convex problem by optimizing $K$ to minimize the loss\nfunction. Furthermore, we discover the relationship between the optimal $K$,\nthe number of lazy clients, and the power of artificial noises used by lazy\nclients. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of the\nproposed framework using the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. Our analytical\nresults are shown to be consistent with the experimental results. In addition,\nthe derived optimal $K$ achieves the minimum value of loss function, and in\nturn the optimal accuracy performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2020 12:18:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-04"}

The agents must learn the optimal strategies by interacting with\ntheir environment i.e., by decentralized Reinforcement Learning (RL). The\npresence of multiple agents with different information makes decentralized\nreinforcement learning conceptually more difficult than centralized\nreinforcement learning. In this paper, we develop a decentralized reinforcement\nlearning algorithm that learns $\\epsilon$-team-optimal solution for partial\nhistory sharing information structure, which encompasses a large class of\ndecentralized control systems including delayed sharing, control sharing, mean\nfield sharing, etc. Our approach consists of two main steps. In the first step,\nwe convert the decentralized control system to an equivalent centralized POMDP\n(Partially Observable Markov Decision Process) using an existing approach\ncalled common information approach.

However, the capacity constraints of services are ignored by\nrecommender systems, which may lead to unsatisfactory recommendation. This\nproblem can be solved by limiting the number of users who receive the\nrecommendation for a service, but this may be viewed as unfair. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel metric Top-N Fairness to measure the individual fairness of\nmulti-round recommendations of services with capacity constraints. By\nconsidering the fact that users are often only affected by top-ranked items in\na recommendation, Top-N Fairness only considers a sub-list consisting of top N\nservices. Based on the metric, we design FAST, a Fairness Assured service\nrecommendation STrategy. FAST adjusts the original recommendation list to\nprovide users with recommendation results that guarantee the long-term fairness\nof multi-round recommendations. We prove the convergence property of the\nvariance of Top-N Fairness of FAST theoretically. FAST is tested on the Yelp\ndataset and synthetic datasets.

Here, we demonstrate\nthat the sub-threshold swing of a topological transistor, in which conduction\nis enabled by a topological phase transition via electric field switching, can\nbe sizably reduced in a non-interacting system by modulating the Rashba\nspin-orbit interaction via a top-gate electric field. We refer to this as the\nTopological Quantum Field Effect and to the transistor as a Topological Quantum\nField Effect transistor (TQFET). By developing a general theoretical framework\nfor quantum spin Hall materials with honeycomb lattices we explicitly show that\nthe Rashba interaction can reduce the sub-threshold swing by more than 25%\ncompared to Boltzmann's limit in currently available materials, but without any\nfundamental lower bound, a discovery that can guide future materials design and\nsteer the engineering of topological quantum devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2020 03:09:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-08"}

The application\nof an electric field across the thickness results in the bending of the strip.\nConversely, a voltage can be detected between the two electrodes when the strip\nis bent. This phenomenon involves multiphysics couplings of\nelectro-mechanical-chemical type. We have previously modeled this system and\ndetermined its constitutive equations using the thermodynamics of linear\nirreversible processes.We applied this model to the case of a cantilevered PEA\nstrip subjected to a continuous voltage between its two faces (static case).\nThe applied forces and the tip displacement are calculated using a beam model\nin large displacements.

The obtained values of the tip\ndisplacement and the blocking force are in good agreement with the experimental\ndata published in the literature.

To obtain insights into how the angular and spectral\nbandwidth of meta-atoms relate to the metasurface focusing performance,\npoint-dipole models are used which incorporate different aspect's of the\nmeta-atoms' angular response. It is emphasized that despite the meta-atoms\nbeing designed under the assumption that they support a single dipolar\nresonance, other resonances exist within the meta-atom geometry and become\nstronger at oblique incidence. These resonances disturb the designed phase and\namplitude responses, resulting in lower focusing efficiency at higher incident\nangles. The modelling of higher order modes leads to good agreement with the\nexperimental measurements, confirming that angular dispersion of the meta-atoms\nis the dominant mechanism in determining off-axis aberrations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2020 08:15:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-15"}
