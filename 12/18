Since graph neural networks\n(GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable success in various graph-related tasks,\nGNNs have been considered as a promising tool to improve the binding affinity\nprediction in recent years. However, most of the existing GNN architectures can\nonly encode the topological graph structure of drugs and proteins without\nconsidering the relative spatial information among their atoms. Whereas,\ndifferent from other graph datasets such as social networks and commonsense\nknowledge graphs, the relative spatial position and chemical bonds among atoms\nhave significant impacts on the binding affinity. To this end, in this paper,\nwe propose a diStance-aware Molecule graph Attention Network (S-MAN) tailored\nto drug-target binding affinity prediction. As a dedicated solution, we first\npropose a position encoding mechanism to integrate the topological structure\nand spatial position information into the constructed pocket-ligand graph.\nMoreover, we propose a novel edge-node hierarchical attentive aggregation\nstructure which has edge-level aggregation and node-level aggregation. The\nhierarchical attentive aggregation can capture spatial dependencies among\natoms, as well as fuse the position-enhanced information with the capability of\ndiscriminating multiple spatial relations among atoms. Finally, we conduct\nextensive experiments on two standard datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness\nof S-MAN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2020 17:44:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-18"}

We\nintroduce a graph transformer with four new properties compared to the standard\nmodel. First, the attention mechanism is a function of the neighborhood\nconnectivity for each node in the graph. Second, the positional encoding is\nrepresented by the Laplacian eigenvectors, which naturally generalize the\nsinusoidal positional encodings often used in NLP.

Finally, the architecture is\nextended to edge feature representation, which can be critical to tasks s.a.\nchemistry (bond type) or link prediction (entity relationship in knowledge\ngraphs). Numerical experiments on a graph benchmark demonstrate the performance\nof the proposed graph transformer architecture.

The dataset consists of three attack groups and seven\ndifferent attack classes or categories. The same dataset further provides\nsignatures of 35 different types of sub-attacks which are related to those\nseven attack classes. The study entailed the design of three-stage machine\nlearning classifier as a misuse intrusion detection system to detect and\nidentify specifically each of the 35 attack subclasses. The first stage of the\nclassifier decides if a record is associated with normal operation or an attack\nsignature.

Three targets have 2-minute cadence light curves available\nby the TESS Science Processing Operations Center: for the rest, we prepared\ncustom light curves from the full-frame images with our own differential\nphotometric FITSH pipeline. Our main goal was to explore the potential and the\nlimitations of TESS concerning the various subtypes of Cepheids.

We also report signs of non-radial modes\nand the first discovery of such a mode in an anomalous Cepheid, the overtone\nstar XZ Cet, which we then confirmed with ground-based multicolor photometric\nmeasurements. We prepared a custom photometric solution to minimize saturation\neffects in the bright fundamental-mode classical Cepheid, $\\beta$ Dor with the\nlightkurve software, and we revealed strong evidence of cycle-to-cycle\nvariations in the star.

However, all these systems ideally assume that the pre-enrolled\nspeaker signals are available and are only evaluated on simple data\nconfigurations. In realistic multi-talker conversations, the speech signal\ncontains a large proportion of non-overlapped regions, where we can derive\nrobust speaker embedding of individual talkers. In this work, we adopt the\nSSUSI model in long recordings and propose a self-informed, clustering-based\ninventory forming scheme for long recording, where the speaker inventory is\nfully built from the input signal without the need for external speaker\nsignals. Experiment results on simulated noisy reverberant long recording\ndatasets show that the proposed method can significantly improve the separation\nperformance across various conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2020 16:44:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2020 15:59:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-21"}

Magnetospheric processes, occurring in\nthe close vicinity of the central black hole, could account for these flares.\n  Aims: We aim to bridge the gap between simulations and observations by\nsynthesizing gamma-ray lightcurves in order to characterize the activity of a\nblack-hole magnetosphere, using kinetic simulations.\n  Methods: We perform global axisymmetric two-dimensional general-relativistic\nparticle-in-cell simulations of a Kerr black-hole magnetosphere. We include a\nself-consistent treatment of radiative processes and plasma supply, as well as\na realistic magnetic configuration, with a large-scale equatorial current\nsheet. We couple our particle-in-cell code with a ray-tracing algorithm, in\norder to produce synthetic lightcurves.\n  Results: These simulations show a highly dynamic magnetosphere, as well as\nvery efficient dissipation of the magnetic energy. An external supply of\nmagnetic flux is found to maintain the magnetosphere in a dynamic state,\notherwise the magnetosphere settles in a quasi-steady Wald-like configuration.\nThe dissipated energy is mostly converted to gamma-ray photons. The lightcurves\nat low viewing angle (face-on) mainly trace the spark gap activity and exhibit\nhigh variability. On the other hand, no significant variability is found at\nhigh viewing angle (edge-on), where the main contribution comes from the\nreconnecting current sheet.\n  Conclusions: We observe that black-hole magnetospheres with a current sheet\nare characterized by a very high radiative efficiency. The typical amplitude of\nthe flares in our simulations is lower than what is detected in active galactic\nnuclei.

The system is capable of recording shot-to-shot\nresolved 6D coincidence datasets, i.e. the kinetic energy and the two take off\nangles for both coincident electrons. The mathematics behind extracting and\nanalysing these multi-dimensional coincidence datasets is introduced, with a\nfocus on coincidence statistics, resulting in fundamental limits of the\nsignal-to-noise ratio and its implications for acquisition times and the size\nof the raw data stream. The functionality of the CoESCA station is demonstrated\nfor the example of Auger electron - photoelectron coincidences from silver\nsurfaces for photoelectrons from the Ag 3d core levels and their corresponding\nMNN Auger electrons.

The gold-standard technique to assess\nstructural changes of the ONH clinically is optical coherence tomography (OCT).\nHowever, OCT is limited to the measurement of a few hand-engineered parameters,\nsuch as the thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), and has not yet\nbeen qualified as a stand-alone device for glaucoma diagnosis and prognosis\napplications.

Numerical\nsimulations show that a regime with bands obliquely drifting in two stream-wise\nsymmetrical directions bifurcates into an asymmetrical regime, before\nultimately decaying to laminar flow.

While previous theories and experiments focused mainly on $S=1/2$\nspin systems, more recently signals of a DSL were detected in an $S=3/2$ system\n$\\alpha$-CrOOH(D). In this work we develop a theory of DSLs on triangular\nlattice with spin-$S$ moments. We argue that in the most natural scenario, a\nspin-$S$ system realizes a $U(2S)$ DSL, described at low energy by gapless\nDirac fermions coupled with an emergent $U(2S)$ gauge field (also known as\n$U(2S)$ QCD$_3$). An appealing feature of this scenario is that at sufficiently\nlarge $S$, the $U(2S)$ QCD becomes intrinsically unstable toward spontaneous\nsymmetry breaking and confinement. The confined phase is simply the\n$120^{\\circ}$ coplanar magnetic order, which agrees with semiclassical\n(large-$S$) results on simple Heisenberg-like models. Other scenarios are\nnevertheless possible, especially at small $S$ when quantum fluctuations are\nstrong. For $S=3/2$, we argue that a $U(1)$ DSL is also theoretically possible\nand phenomenologically compatible with existing measurements. One way to\ndistinguish the $U(3)$ DSL from the $U(1)$ DSL is to break time-reversal\nsymmetry, for example by adding a spin chirality term\n$\\vec{S}_i\\cdot(\\vec{S}_j\\times\\vec{S}_k)$ in numerical simulations: the $U(1)$\nDSL becomes the standard Kalmeyer-Laughlin chiral spin liquid with\nsemion/anti-semion excitation; the $U(3)$ DSL, in contrast, becomes a\nnon-abelian chiral spin liquid described by the $SU(2)_3$ topological order,\nwith Fibonacci-like anyons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2020 18:20:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-18"}

On NISQ devices, two-qubit gates such as CNOTs are much\nnoisier than single-qubit gates, so it is essential to minimize their count.\nQuantum circuit synthesis is a process of decomposing an arbitrary unitary into\na sequence of quantum gates, and can be used as an optimization tool to produce\nshorter circuits to improve overall circuit fidelity. However, the\ntime-to-solution of synthesis grows exponentially with the number of qubits. As\na result, synthesis is intractable for circuits on a large qubit scale.\n  In this paper, we propose a hierarchical, block-by-block optimization\nframework, QGo, for quantum circuit optimization. Our approach allows an\nexponential cost optimization to scale to large circuits. QGo uses a\ncombination of partitioning and synthesis: 1) partition the circuit into a\nsequence of independent circuit blocks; 2) re-generate and optimize each block\nusing quantum synthesis; and 3) re-compose the final circuit by stitching all\nthe blocks together. We perform our analysis and show the fidelity improvements\nin three different regimes: small-size circuits on real devices, medium-size\ncircuits on noise simulations, and large-size circuits on analytical models.\nUsing a set of NISQ benchmarks, we show that QGo can reduce the number of CNOT\ngates by 29.9% on average and up to 50% when compared with industrial compilers\nsuch as t|ket>. When executed on the IBM Athens system, shorter depth leads to\nhigher circuit fidelity. We also demonstrate the scalability of our QGo\ntechnique to optimize circuits of 60+ qubits.

The rich variety of appearance and interactions between humans\ndepicted over a large temporal context in these films could be a valuable\nsource of data. However, the richness of data comes at the expense of\nfundamental challenges such as abrupt shot changes and close up shots of actors\nwith heavy truncation, which limits the applicability of existing human 3D\nunderstanding methods. In this paper, we address these limitations with an\ninsight that while shot changes of the same scene incur a discontinuity between\nframes, the 3D structure of the scene still changes smoothly. This allows us to\nhandle frames before and after the shot change as multi-view signal that\nprovide strong cues to recover the 3D state of the actors. We propose a\nmulti-shot optimization framework, which leads to improved 3D reconstruction\nand mining of long sequences with pseudo ground truth 3D human mesh. We show\nthat the resulting data is beneficial in the training of various human mesh\nrecovery models: for single image, we achieve improved robustness; for video we\npropose a pure transformer-based temporal encoder, which can naturally handle\nmissing observations due to shot changes in the input frames.

However, general-purpose platforms such as CPUs\nand GPUs are inefficient when performing attention inference due to complicated\ndata movement and low arithmetic intensity. Moreover, existing NN accelerators\nmainly focus on optimizing convolutional or recurrent models, and cannot\nefficiently support attention.

While various\nneural network representations have been developed, previous works are still\ninefficient to investigate the noise-resilient performance, especially on\naerial images with noise taken by the cameras with telephoto lenses, and most\nof the research is concentrated in the field of denoising. Of course, denoising\nusually requires an additional computational burden to obtain higher quality\nimages, while noise-resilient is more of a description of the robustness of the\nnetwork itself to different noises, which is an attribute of the algorithm\nitself. For this reason, the work will be started by analyzing the\nnoise-resilient performance of the neural network, and then propose two\nhypotheses to build a noise-resilient structure. Based on these hypotheses, we\ncompare the noise-resilient ability of the Oct-ResNet with frequency division\nprocessing and the commonly used ResNet. In addition, previous feature pyramid\nnetworks used for aerial object detection tasks are not specifically designed\nfor the frequency division feature maps of the Oct-ResNet, and they usually\nlack attention to bridging the semantic gap between diverse feature maps from\ndifferent depths. On the basis of this, a novel octave convolution-based\nsemantic attention feature pyramid network (OcSaFPN) is proposed to get higher\naccuracy in object detection with noise. The proposed algorithm tested on three\ndatasets demonstrates that the proposed OcSaFPN achieves a state-of-the-art\ndetection performance with Gaussian noise or multiplicative noise. In addition,\nmore experiments have proved that the OcSaFPN structure can be easily added to\nexisting algorithms, and the noise-resilient ability can be effectively\nimproved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2020 01:28:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-21"}

As a result, a previous study of AR Sco was unable to\ndetect the WD in the averaged far-ultraviolet spectrum from a Hubble Space\nTelescope (HST) observation. In an effort to unveil the WD's spectrum, we\nreanalyze these HST observations by calculating the average spectrum in the\ntroughs between synchrotron pulses.

The phenomenon emerges as a many-body\neffect of the interplay of the quadratic Zeeman effect, that breaks the\nrotational symmetry, and the spin-spin interactions. By performing full quantum\ndiagonalizations very accurate time evolution of large condensates are\nanalyzed, leading to heuristic analytic expressions for the time dependence of\nthe one-body density matrix, in the weak and strong interacting regimes, for\ninitial coherent states. We are able to find accurate analytical expressions\nfor both the decoherence and the recurrence times, in terms of the number of\natoms and strength parameters, that show remarkable differences depending on\nthe strength of the spin-spin interactions. The features of the stationary\nstates in both regimes is also investigated.

In small subsystems located in the bulk, the entropy continues to\nfurther grow towards $\\ln 3$, as domain walls traverse the subsystem and\nincrement the population of the two oppositely ordered states, restoring the\n$\\mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetry. The latter growth in entropy is seen also in small\nsubsystems near an open boundary in a non-chiral clock model. In contrast to\nthis, in the case of the chiral model, the entropy of small subsystems near an\nopen boundary saturates. We rationalize the difference in behavior in terms of\nqualitatively different scattering properties of domain walls at the open\nboundary in the chiral model.

This task is found in many applications such as\npersonalized medicine or targeted advertising and has gained a surge of\ninterest in recent years under the name of Uplift Modeling. It consists in\ntargeting treatment to the individuals for whom it would be the most\nbeneficial. In real life scenarios, when we do not have access to ground-truth\nindividual treatment effect, the capacity of models to do so is generally\nmeasured by the Area Under the Uplift Curve (AUUC), a metric that differs from\nthe learning objectives of most of the Individual Treatment Effect (ITE)\nmodels.

In this work,\nwe show how attention mechanisms can be used to replace another canonical\noperation: strided transposed convolution. We term our novel attention-based\noperation attention-based upsampling since it increases/upsamples the spatial\ndimensions of the feature maps. Through experiments on single image\nsuper-resolution and joint-image upsampling tasks, we show that attention-based\nupsampling consistently outperforms traditional upsampling methods based on\nstrided transposed convolution or based on adaptive filters while using fewer\nparameters. We show that the inherent flexibility of the attention mechanism,\nwhich allows it to use separate sources for calculating the attention\ncoefficients and the attention targets, makes attention-based upsampling a\nnatural choice when fusing information from multiple image modalities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2020 19:58:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-21"}

We identify a unique 'V-shape'\npattern for suppression of higher-order modes loss by optimizing free design\nparameters of HC-ARF. We find that a 5-tube nested HC-ARF has wider\ntransmission window and better single-mode operation than 6-tube HC-ARF. We\nshow that the propagation loss can be significantly improved by using\nanisotropic nested anti-resonant tubes elongated in the radial direction. Our\nsimulations indicate that with this novel fiber design, a propagation loss as\nlow as 0.11 dB/km at 1.55 $\\mu$m can be achieved. Our results provide design\ninsights towards fully exploiting single-mode, wide-band, and ultra low-loss\nHC-ARF. In addition, the extraordinary optical properties of the proposed fiber\ncan be beneficial for several applications such as future optical communication\nsystem, high energy light transport, extreme non-nonlinear optics and beyond.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2020 20:18:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-21"}

Reducing the statistical uncertainty in these analyses is an\nimportant objective for statisticians. Registries, prior trials, and health\nrecords constitute a growing compendium of historical data on patients under\nstandard-of-care that may be exploitable to this end. However, most methods for\nhistorical borrowing achieve reductions in variance by sacrificing strict\ntype-I error rate control. Here, we propose a use of historical data that\nexploits linear covariate adjustment to improve the efficiency of trial\nanalyses without incurring bias. Specifically, we train a prognostic model on\nthe historical data, then estimate the treatment effect using a linear\nregression while adjusting for the trial subjects' predicted outcomes (their\nprognostic scores). We prove that, under certain conditions, this prognostic\ncovariate adjustment procedure attains the minimum variance possible among a\nlarge class of estimators. When those conditions are not met, prognostic\ncovariate adjustment is still more efficient than raw covariate adjustment and\nthe gain in efficiency is proportional to a measure of the predictive accuracy\nof the prognostic model above and beyond the linear relationship with the raw\ncovariates. We demonstrate the approach using simulations and a reanalysis of\nan Alzheimer's Disease clinical trial and observe meaningful reductions in\nmean-squared error and the estimated variance. Lastly, we provide a simplified\nformula for asymptotic variance that enables power calculations that account\nfor these gains.

The Vision Transformer was the\nfirst major attempt to apply a pure transformer model directly to images as\ninput, demonstrating that as compared to convolutional networks,\ntransformer-based architectures can achieve competitive results on benchmark\nclassification tasks. However, the computational complexity of the attention\noperator means that we are limited to low-resolution inputs. For more complex\ntasks such as detection or segmentation, maintaining a high input resolution is\ncrucial to ensure that models can properly identify and reflect fine details in\ntheir output.

Past work has addressed this limitation via\nhandcrafted data augmentations that eliminate irrelevant information. This\napproach however does not work across all datasets and tasks. Further, data\naugmentations fail in addressing feature suppression in multi-attribute\nclassification when one attribute can suppress features relevant to other\nattributes.

This SoBEst\napproach takes into account both relevant and irrelevant records within a\ngeographic area, where relevant records contain a POI name or its variations in\ntheir text field. Our study is motivated by the following empirical\nobservation: a fixed representative coordinate of each POI that SoBEst\nbasically assumes may be far away from the centroid of the estimated social POI\nboundary for certain POIs. Thus, using SoBEst in such cases may possibly result\nin unsatisfactory performance on the boundary estimation quality (BEQ), which\nis expressed as a function of the $F$-measure. To solve this problem, we\nformulate a joint optimization problem of simultaneously finding the radius of\na circle and the POI's representative coordinate $c$ by allowing to update $c$.\nSubsequently, we design an iterative SoBEst (I-SoBEst) algorithm, which enables\nus to achieve a higher degree of BEQ for some POIs. The computational\ncomplexity of the proposed I-SoBEst algorithm is shown to scale linearly with\nthe number of records. We demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm over\ncompeting clustering methods including the original SoBEst.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2020 00:41:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-21"}

Recently, it has\nbeen reformulated in terms of a nonvanishing relative entropy density between\nmicrocanonical and canonical probabilities.

The aircraft\naerodynamics are inherently turbulent with mean-flow three-dimensionality,\noften accompanied by laminar-to-turbulent transition, flow separation,\nsecondary flow motions at corners, and shock wave formation, to name a few.\nHowever, the most widespread wall models are built upon the assumption of\nstatistically-in-equilibrium wall-bounded turbulence and do not faithfully\naccount for the wide variety of flow conditions described above.

In this work, we propose\ntackling the wall-modeling challenge by devising the flow as a collection of\nbuilding blocks, whose information enables the prediction of the stress as the\nwall. The model relies on the assumption that simple canonical flows contain\nthe essential flow physics to devise accurate models. Three types of building\nblock units were used to train the model: turbulent channel flows, turbulent\nducts and turbulent boundary layers with separation. This limited training set\nwill be extended in future versions of the model. The approach is implemented\nusing two interconnected artificial neural networks: a classifier, which\nidentifies the contribution of each building block in the flow; and a\npredictor, which estimates the wall stress via non-linear combinations of\nbuilding-block units. The output of the model is accompanied by the confidence\nin the prediction.

Physiologically, brain\nstrain is often considered the key parameter of brain injury. To evaluate the\nBIC's risk estimation accuracy across five datasets comprising different head\nimpact types, linear regression was used to model 95% maximum principal strain,\n95% maximum principal strain at the corpus callosum, and cumulative strain\ndamage (15%) on each of 18 BIC respectively. The results show a significant\ndifference in the relationship between BIC and brain strain across datasets,\nindicating the same BIC value may suggest different brain strain in different\nhead impact types. The accuracy of brain strain regression is generally\ndecreasing if the BIC regression models are fit on a dataset with a different\ntype of head impact rather than on the dataset with the same type.

While recent proposals (like spherical CNN)\nhave extended a number of deep neural network architectures to manifold-valued\ndata, and this has often provided strong improvements in performance, the\nliterature on generative models for manifold data is quite sparse. Partly due\nto this gap, there are also no modality transfer/translation models for\nmanifold-valued data whereas numerous such methods based on generative models\nare available for natural images. This paper addresses this gap, motivated by a\nneed in brain imaging -- in doing so, we expand the operating range of certain\ngenerative models (as well as generative models for modality transfer) from\nnatural images to images with manifold-valued measurements. Our main result is\nthe design of a two-stream version of GLOW (flow-based invertible generative\nmodels) that can synthesize information of a field of one type of\nmanifold-valued measurements given another. On the theoretical side, we\nintroduce three kinds of invertible layers for manifold-valued data, which are\nnot only analogous to their functionality in flow-based generative models\n(e.g., GLOW) but also preserve the key benefits (determinants of the Jacobian\nare easy to calculate).

One solution\nto increase model reliability and generalizability is to identify causal\nassociations between features and classes. In this paper, we propose to train a\nrobust text classifier by augmenting the training data with automatically\ngenerated counterfactual data. We first identify likely causal features using a\nstatistical matching approach. Next, we generate counterfactual samples for the\noriginal training data by substituting causal features with their antonyms and\nthen assigning opposite labels to the counterfactual samples. Finally, we\ncombine the original data and counterfactual data to train a robust classifier.\nExperiments on two classification tasks show that a traditional classifier\ntrained on the original data does very poorly on human-generated counterfactual\nsamples (e.g., 10%-37% drop in accuracy). However, the classifier trained on\nthe combined data is more robust and performs well on both the original test\ndata and the counterfactual test data (e.g., 12%-25% increase in accuracy\ncompared with the traditional classifier). Detailed analysis shows that the\nrobust classifier makes meaningful and trustworthy predictions by emphasizing\ncausal features and de-emphasizing non-causal features.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2020 03:57:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-21"}

We use the classical asymptotic\nmethods of stationary phase and steepest descents to show that solutions which\napproach the attracting quasi-steady state (QSS) before the Hopf bifurcation\nremain near that state for long times after the Hopf bifurcation and the QSS\nhas become repelling. In the complex time plane, the phase function of the\nlinear PDE has a saddle point, and the Stokes and anti-Stokes lines are central\nto the asymptotics. The nonlinear terms are treated by applying an iterative\nmethod to the mild form of the PDE given by perturbations about the linear\nparticular solution. This tracks the closeness of solutions near the attracting\nand repelling QSS. Next, we show that beyond a key Stokes line through the\nsaddle there is a space-time buffer curve along which the particular solution\nof the linear PDE ceases to be exponentially small, causing the solution of the\nnonlinear PDE to diverge from the repelling QSS and exhibit large-amplitude\noscillations. The homogeneous solution also stops being exponentially small in\na spatially dependent manner, as determined also by the initial time. We find\nfour different cases of DHB, depending on the competition between the\nhomogeneous and particular solutions, and we quantify how these depend on\nsystem parameters. Examples are presented for each case, with uni-modal,\nspatially-periodic, smooth step, and algebraically-growing source terms. Also,\nrich spatio-temporal dynamics are observed in the post-DHB oscillations.\nFinally, it is shown that large-amplitude source terms can be designed so that\nsolutions spend substantially longer times near the repelling QSS, and hence\nregion-specific control over the delayed onset of oscillations can be achieved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2020 04:32:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-21"}

As suggested in\nprevious multi-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, a sufficiently powerful\ncentral energy source can blow away the expanding supernova ejecta, leading to\nefficient mixing of stratified layers in the ejecta. We assume that the energy\ninjection is realized in the form of non-thermal radiation from the wind nebula\nembedded at the center of the ejecta. We found that the multi-dimensional\nmixing in the ejecta assists the injected non-thermal radiation escaping from\nthe ejecta. When the non-thermal radiation is absorbed by the ejecta, it is\nconverted into bright thermal radiation or is consumed as the kinetic energy of\nthe supernova ejecta. We found that central energy sources with the injection\ntimescale similar to the photon diffusion timescale realize an efficient\nconversion of the injected energy into thermal radiation. On the other hand, a\nrapid energy injection ends up accelerating the ejecta rather than giving rise\nto bright thermal emission. This remarkable difference potentially explains the\ndiversity of energetic supernovae including broad-lined Ic and superluminous\nsupernovae.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2020 05:40:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-03"}

Still, this assumption is not valid in practice, especially\nwhen applying learned dictionaries as sparsifying transforms. The problem is\nmore strongly pronounced with multidimensional sparsity. In this paper, we\npropose an algorithm for estimating the composite sparsity lying in multiple\ndomains defined by learned dictionaries.

This inference is achieved by a\nmachine learning prediction. This setting learns the intrinsic relationship\nbetween the columns of a dictionary and those of such a fixed basis.

We show that $\\mathsf{PSTray}(T)$ occupies $O(n)$\nspace and supports pattern matching queries in $O(m + \\log (\\sigma+\\pi) +\n\\mathit{occ})$ time, where $n$ is the length of $T$, $m$ is the length of a\nquery pattern $P$, $\\pi$ is the number of distinct symbols of $|\\Pi|$ in $T$,\n$\\sigma$ is the number of distinct symbols of $|\\Sigma|$ in $T$ and\n$\\mathit{occ}$ is the number of p-matching occurrences of $P$ in $T$. We also\npresent how to build $\\mathsf{PSTray}(T)$ in $O(n)$ time from the parameterized\nsuffix tree of $T$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2020 07:53:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Feb 2021 03:26:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-05"}

The aim of this paper is to introduce a mathematical\nframework that follows the whole trait distribution (without prior assumption)\nto study evolutionary dynamics of sexually reproducing populations.\nSpecifically, it focuses on complex traits, whose inheritance can be encoded by\nthe infinitesimal model of segregation (Fisher 1919). We show that it allows us\nto derive a regime in which our model gives the same dynamics as when assuming\na Gaussian trait distribution. To support that, we compare the stationary\nproblems of the system of moments derived from our model with the one given in\nRonce and Kirkpatrick 2001 and show that they are equivalent under this regime\nand do not need to be otherwise. Moreover, under this regime of equivalence, we\nshow that a separation bewteen ecological and evolutionary time scales arises.\nA fast relaxation toward monomorphism allows us to reduce the complexity of the\nsystem of moments, using a slow-fast analysis. This reduction leads us to\ncomplete, still in this regime, the analytical description of the bistable\nasymmetrical equilibria numerically found in Ronce and Kirkpatrick 2001.

FI is a subdivision of the IPC, an international\npatent classification code, that is related to Japanese technology. FIs are\nrevised to keep up with technological developments. These revisions have\nalready established more than 30,000 new FIs since 2006. However, these\nrevisions require a lot of time and workload.

Therefore, using machine learning to assist\nin the revision of patent classification codes (FI) will lead to improved\naccuracy and efficiency. This study analyzes patent documents from this new\nperspective of assisting in the revision of patent classification codes with\nmachine learning. To analyze time-series changes in patents, we used the\ndynamic topic model (DTM), which is an extension of the latent Dirichlet\nallocation (LDA). Also, unlike English, the Japanese language requires\nmorphological analysis. Patents contain many technical words that are not used\nin everyday life, so morphological analysis using a common dictionary is not\nsufficient. Therefore, we used a technique for extracting technical terms from\ntext. After extracting technical terms, we applied them to DTM. In this study,\nwe determined the technological progress of the lighting class F21 for 14 years\nand compared it with the actual revision of patent classification codes. In\nother words, we extracted technical terms from Japanese patents and applied DTM\nto determine the progress of Japanese technology.

When realizing such a\nsystem, one important issue is the segmentation of audio to deal with streaming\ninput or long recording. After audio segmentation, the ASR model with a small\nreal-time factor (RTF) is preferable because the latency of the system can be\nfaster. Recently, E2E ASR based on non-autoregressive models becomes a\npromising approach since it can decode an $N$-length token sequence with less\nthan $N$ iterations. We propose a system to concatenate audio segmentation and\nnon-autoregressive ASR to realize high accuracy and low RTF ASR. As a\nnon-autoregressive ASR, the insertion-based model is used. In addition, instead\nof concatenating separated models for segmentation and ASR, we introduce a new\narchitecture that realizes audio segmentation and non-autoregressive ASR by a\nsingle neural network.

In\norder to solve other type of optimization problems, it is necessary to apply\ncertain kinds of mathematical transformations. However, linear constraints\nreduce the size of problems that can be represented in quantum annealers, owing\nto the sparseness of connections between qubits. For example, the quadratic\nassignment problem (QAP) with linear equality constraints can be solved only up\nto size 12 in the quantum annealer D-Wave Advantage, which has 5640 qubits. To\novercome this obstacle, Ohzeki developed a method for relaxing the linear\nequality constraints and numerically verified the effectiveness of this method\nwith some target problems, but others remain unsolvable.

We explore several free parameters such as the belt's mass or the\nbinary's mass ratio and orbit. We use the GraTeR package to produce 2-D\nluminosity maps and system-integrated SEDs. We confirm a preliminary result\nobtained by earlier DyCoSS studies, which is that the coupled effect of\ncollisional activity, binary perturbations and stellar radiation pressure\nmaintains a halo of small grains in the dynamically unstable region between the\n2 stars. In addition, several spatial structures are identified, notably a\nsingle spiral arm stretching all the way from the PB belt to the companion\nstar. We also identify a fainter and more compact disc around the secondary\nstar, which is non-native and feeds off small grains from the unstable halo.\nBoth the halo, spiral arm and secondary disc should be detectable on resolved\nimages by instruments with capacities similar to SPHERE. The system as a whole\nis depleted in small grains when compared to a companion-free case. This\ndepletion leaves an imprint on the system's integrated SED, which appears\ncolder than for the same parent body belt around a single star.

As such, this out-dated player\ncharacterisation must be removed to provide true guarantees of safety and\nliveness in a major stride towards universal trust in state machine replication\nprotocols and a new scale of adoption. As all current state machine replication\nprotocols are built on these legacy standards, it is imperative that a new\nplayer model is identified and utilised to reflect the true nature of players\nin tokenised protocols, now and into the future.\n  To this effect, we propose the ByRa player model for state machine\nreplication protocols.

In the ByRa model, we identify the properties of strong incentive\ncompatibility in expectation and fairness that all protocols must satisfy in\norder to achieve state machine replication.

Existing models explaining the\nconvergence of appraisal networks to structural balance either diverge in\nfinite time, or could get stuck in jammed states, or converge to only complete\ngraphs. In this paper, we study the open problem how steady non-all-to-all\nstructural balance emerges via local dynamics of interpersonal appraisals. We\nfirst compare two well-justified definitions of structural balance for general\nnon-all-to-all graphs, i.e., the triad-wise structural balance and the\ntwo-faction structural balance, and thoroughly study their relations. Secondly,\nbased on three widely adopted sociological mechanisms: the symmetry mechanism,\nthe influence mechanism, and the homophily mechanism, we propose two simple\nmodels of gossip-like appraisal dynamics, the symmetry-influence-homophily\n(SIH) dynamics and the symmetry-influence-opinion-homophily (SIOH) dynamics. In\nthese models, the appraisal network starting from any initial condition almost\nsurely achieves non-all-to-all triad-wise and two-faction structural balance in\nfinite time respectively. Moreover, the SIOH dynamics capture the co-evolution\nof interpersonal appraisals and individuals' opinions. Regarding the\ntheoretical contributions, we show that the equilibrium set of the SIH (SIOH\nresp.) dynamics corresponds to the set of all the possible triad-wise\n(two-faction resp.) structural balance configurations of the appraisal\nnetworks. Moreover, we prove that, for any initial condition, the appraisal\nnetworks in the SIH (SIOH resp.) dynamics almost surely achieve triad-wise\n(two-faction resp.) structural balance in finite time.

Bulk\nfields and, more generally, defect fields inserted on defect lines, are given\nby internal natural transformations between the functors that label the types\nof defect lines. We use the theory of internal natural transformations to\nidentify candidates for operator products of defect fields (of which there are\ntwo types, either along a single defect line, or accompanied by the fusion of\ntwo defect lines), and for bulk-boundary OPEs. We show that the so obtained\nOPEs pass various consistency conditions, including in particular all\ngenus-zero constraints in Lewellen's list.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2020 10:38:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Apr 2021 16:08:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-21"}

This motivates the research on improving the retinal vasculature\nsegmentation. Nowadays, Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (FCNs) usually\nrepresent the most successful approach to image segmentation. However, the\nsuccess of these models is conditioned by an adequate selection and adaptation\nof the architectures and techniques used, as well as the availability of a\nlarge amount of annotated data. These two issues become specially relevant when\napplying FCNs to medical image segmentation as, first, the existent models are\nusually adjusted from broad domain applications over photographic images, and\nsecond, the amount of annotated data is usually scarcer. In this work, we\npresent multimodal transfer learning-based approaches for retinal vascular\nsegmentation, performing a comparative study of recent FCN architectures. In\nparticular, to overcome the annotated data scarcity, we propose the novel\napplication of self-supervised network pretraining that takes advantage of\nexistent unlabelled multimodal data. The results demonstrate that the\nself-supervised pretrained networks obtain significantly better vascular masks\nwith less training in the target task, independently of the network\narchitecture, and that some FCN architecture advances motivated for broad\ndomain applications do not translate into significant improvements over the\nvasculature segmentation task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2020 10:38:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-23"}

Flow control\nstrategies are investigated at a diameter-based Reynolds number Re_D = 100\nusing advantage actor-critic (A2C) algorithm by means of two symmetric plasma\nactuators located on the surface of the cylinder near the separation point.

Instrumental\nvariables must satisfy strong, often untestable assumptions, which means that\nfinding good genetic instruments among a large list of potential candidates is\nchallenging. This difficulty is compounded by the fact that many genetic\nvariants influence more than one phenotype through different causal pathways, a\nphenomenon called horizontal pleiotropy.

The output of the method is a posterior\ndistribution over the target causal effect, which provides an immediate and\neasily interpretable measure of the uncertainty in the estimation.

It is easily observable with several transitions in the\nmillimeter wavelength range, and has been widely used as a tracer of the gas\ndensity in the interstellar medium in our Galaxy and external galaxies.\nChemical models fail to account for the observed CS abundances when assuming\nthe cosmic value for the elemental abundance of sulfur. The CS+O -> CO + S\nreaction has been proposed as a relevant CS destruction mechanism at low\ntemperatures, and could explain the discrepancy between models and\nobservations. Its reaction rate has been experimentally measured at\ntemperatures of 150-400 K, but the extrapolation to lower temperatures is\ndoubtful. Here we calculate the CS+O reaction rate at temperatures <150 K which\nare prevailing in the interstellar medium.

These PESs are used to study\nthe reaction dynamics, using several methods to eventually calculate the CS+O\nthermal reaction rates.

Our detailed theoretical\nstudy on the CS+O reaction, which is in agreement with the experimental data\nobtained at 150-400 K, demonstrates the reliability of our approach. After a\ncareful analysis at lower temperatures, we find that the rate constant at 10 K\nis negligible, which is consistent with the extrapolation of experimental data\nusing the Arrhenius expression. We use the updated chemical network to model\nthe sulfur chemistry in TMC1 based on molecular abundances determined from GEMS\nproject observations.

The body's exterior metric is calculated\nin a simultaneous expansion in powers of the ratio between the distance to the\nbody and three distinct length scales: the radius of curvature of the external\nspacetime in which the body is inserted, the scale of spatial inhomogeneity of\nthe curvature, and the scale of temporal variation. The metric is valid in the\nbody's immediate neighborhood, which excludes the external matter responsible\nfor the tidal environment. The body's tidal response is encapsulated in four\ntypes of relativistic Love numbers: $k_\\ell$, the familiar Love number that\nmeasures the linear response to a static tidal field, $p_\\ell$, which measures\nthe quadratic response to the tidal field, $\\dot{k}_\\ell$ and $\\ddot{k}_\\ell$,\nassociated with first and second time derivatives of the tidal field,\nrespectively. The Love numbers acquire an operational meaning through the\ndefinition of tidally induced multipole moments. Previously proposed\ndefinitions for the moments suffer from ambiguities associated with the\nsubtraction of a \"pure tidal field\" from the full metric. A robust operational\ndefinition is proposed here. It relies on inserting the body's local metric\nwithin a global metric constructed in post-Newtonian theory; the global metric\nincludes the external matter responsible for the tidal environment. When viewed\nin the post-Newtonian spacetime, the compact body appears as a skeletonized\nobject with a specific multipole structure. The tidally induced multipole\nmoments provide a description of this structure. They manifest themselves, for\nexample, in the body's tidal acceleration, which is nonlinear in the tidal\nfield. At leading order in the tidal interaction, the acceleration is\nproportional to the $k_2$ Love number as calculated in full general relativity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2020 12:07:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 7 Mar 2021 18:39:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-24"}

True concurrency gives much richer models and logics, but is also\nharder to work with, as the interactions of causality and concurrency can\nbecome complex.\n  In probabilistic computation, we have by now many well understood\nprobabilistic models and logics on interleaving models, developed over the last\nthirty years or so. However, for true concurrency, adding probability has been\nmuch harder, owing to the interactions between probabilistic independence and\ncausal/concurrent independence, piling both conceptual and technical\ndifficulties upon an already complex model. Various notions of, e.g.,\nprobabilistic Petri net have been introduced, but for simpler cases such as\nfree-choice nets.\n  A significant contribution in the last decade was Abbes and Benveniste 2006,\nwhich gave a rigorous foundation for probabilistic concurrency in terms of\nWinskel's event structures, which can be seen as the lowest level of\nconcurrent/causal modelling.

Many real-world problems have large state-spaces and/or\naction-spaces such as in Go, StarCraft, protein folding, and robotics or are\nnon-Markovian, which cause significant challenges to RL algorithms. In this\nwork we address the large action-space problem by sequentializing actions,\nwhich can reduce the action-space size significantly, even down to two actions\nat the expense of an increased planning horizon. We provide explicit and exact\nconstructions and equivalence proofs for all quantities of interest for\narbitrary history-based processes.

On the upside, ESA enjoys similar optimality guarantees as Markovian\nmodels do. But a downside is that the size of the aggregated state-space\nbecomes exponential in the size of the action-space. In this work, we patch\nthis issue by binarizing the action-space.

It is often necessary to run programs of exclusive experiments, i.e.,\nexperiments that cannot be run on the same units during the same time. These\nprograms implies restriction on the random sampling, as units that are\ncurrently in an experiment cannot be sampled into a new one. Moreover, to\ntechnically enable this type of coordination with large populations, the units\nin the population are often grouped into 'buckets' and sampling is then\nperformed on the bucket level. This paper investigates some statistical\nimplications of both the restricted sampling and the bucket-level sampling. The\ncontribution of this paper is threefold: First, bucket sampling is connected to\nthe existing literature on randomized experiments in complex sampling designs\nwhich enables establishing properties of the difference-in-means estimator of\nthe average treatment effect. These properties are needed for inference to the\npopulation under random sampling of buckets. Second, the bias introduced by\nrestricting the sampling as imposed by programs of exclusive experiments, is\nderived. Finally, simulation results supporting the theoretical findings are\npresented together with recommendations on how to empirically evaluate and\nhandle this bias.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2020 12:46:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-21"}

Current models are limited in finding the appropriate decision\nboundary to balance the performances of both known intents and the open intent.\nIn this paper, we propose a post-processing method to learn the adaptive\ndecision boundary (ADB) for open intent classification.

Then, we automatically\nlearn the adaptive spherical decision boundary for each known class with the\naid of well-trained features. Specifically, we propose a new loss function to\nbalance both the empirical risk and the open space risk.

As the number of reflecting elements increases,\nthe reflection resource allocation (RRA) will become urgently needed in this\ncontext, which is due to the non-ignorable energy consumption. The goal of this\npaper, therefore, is to realize the RRA besides the active-passive beamforming\ndesign, where RRA is based on the introduced modular IRS architecture. The\nmodular IRS consists with multiple modules, each of which has multiple\nreflecting elements and is equipped with a smart controller, all the\ncontrollers can communicate with each other in a point-to-point fashion via\nfiber links.

To\nsearch adversarial modifiers, we directly search adversarial latent codes in\nthe latent space without tuning the pre-trained parameters.

VHE $\\gamma$-ray observations with\nH.E.S.S. and MAGIC during late May and early June 2016 resulted in the\ndetection of an unprecedented flare, which reveals for the first time VHE\n$\\gamma$-ray intranight variability in this source. While a common variability\ntimescale of $1.5\\,$hr is found, there is a significant deviation near the end\nof the flare with a timescale of $\\sim 20\\,$min marking the cessation of the\nevent. The peak flux is nearly two orders of magnitude above the low-level\nemission. For the first time, curvature is detected in the VHE $\\gamma$-ray\nspectrum of PKS 1510-089, which is fully explained through absorption by the\nextragalactic background light. Optical R-band observations with ATOM reveal a\ncounterpart of the $\\gamma$-ray flare, even though the detailed flux evolution\ndiffers from the VHE ightcurve. Interestingly, a steep flux decrease is\nobserved at the same time as the cessation of the VHE flare. In the high energy\n(HE, $E>100\\,$MeV) $\\gamma$-ray band only a moderate flux increase is observed\nwith Fermi-LAT, while the HE $\\gamma$-ray spectrum significantly hardens up to\na photon index of 1.6. A search for broad-line region (BLR) absorption features\nin the $\\gamma$-ray spectrum indicates that the emission region is located\noutside of the BLR. Radio VLBI observations reveal a fast moving knot\ninteracting with a standing jet feature around the time of the flare. As the\nstanding feature is located $\\sim 50\\,$pc from the black hole, the emission\nregion of the flare may have been located at a significant distance from the\nblack hole. If this correlation is indeed true, VHE $\\gamma$ rays have been\nproduced far down the jet where turbulent plasma crosses a standing shock.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2020 14:10:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-05"}

Judged from the\nformation enthalpy of different CSH compounds, our studies conclude that\ncertain levels of carbon doping (~5%-6%) in sulfur hydride (H$_3$S) in its R3m\nand phases gives rise to the most-stable structure (second to the H$_3$S\nitself) among the various CSH systems found. The replacement of a small amount\nof sulfur atoms by carbon in compounds like C$_1$S$_{15}$H$_{48}$ and\nC$_1$S$_{17}$H$_{54}$ results in a stronger electron-phonon coupling and a\nhigher averaged phonon frequency that increases with pressure, thereby leading\nto room-temperature superconductivity at ~270 GPa.

If the density of the drop is larger than the surrounding, the\ninterface between the drop liquid layer and its surrounding becomes unstable,\nproducing mushroom-shaped plumes growing radially outward. We interpret this\ninstability as a spherical Rayleigh-Taylor instability associated with the\ndeceleration of the interface between the drop and its surrounding, which\nsignificantly exceeds the ambient vertical gravity. We investigate\nexperimentally how changing the density contrast and the impact Froude number\naffects the instability and the resulting mixing layer. Using backlighting and\nplanar laser-induced fluorescence methods, the position of the air-liquid\ninterface, the thickness of the mixing layer, and an estimate of the\ninstability wavelength are obtained. First, the evolution of the mean crater\nradius is derived from an energy conservation model. The observed mixing layer\ndynamics is then explained by a model involving a competition between the\ngeometrical expansion of the crater tending to decrease its thickness, and\nmixing produced by the Rayleigh-Taylor instability tending to increase its\nthickness. The estimated instability wavelength is finally compared to an\napproximate linear stability analysis of a radially accelerated fluid sphere\ninto a less dense fluid. Mixing properties of this impact-related instability\nhave geophysical implications regarding the differentiation of terrestrial\nplanets, in particular by estimating the mass of magma ocean silicates that\nequilibrates with the metal core of the impacting planetesimals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2020 14:52:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-21"}

A bilinear (outer-product) expansion is thought to encourage models to\nlearn interactions between two feature spaces and has experimentally\noutperformed `simpler' vector operations (concatenation and\nelement-wise-addition/multiplication) on VQA benchmarks. Successive BLP\ntechniques have yielded higher performance with lower computational expense and\nare often implemented alongside attention mechanisms. However, despite\nsignificant progress in VQA, BLP methods have not been widely applied to more\nrecently explored video question answering (video-QA) tasks. In this paper, we\nbegin to bridge this research gap by applying BLP techniques to various\nvideo-QA benchmarks, namely: TVQA, TGIF-QA, Ego-VQA and MSVD-QA. We share our\nresults on the TVQA baseline model, and the recently proposed\nheterogeneous-memory-enchanced multimodal attention (HME) model. Our\nexperiments include both simply replacing feature concatenation in the existing\nmodels with BLP, and a modified version of the TVQA baseline to accommodate BLP\nwe name the `dual-stream' model. We find that our relatively simple integration\nof BLP does not increase, and mostly harms, performance on these video-QA\nbenchmarks. Using recently proposed theoretical multimodal fusion taxonomies,\nwe offer insight into why BLP-driven performance gain for video-QA benchmarks\nmay be more difficult to achieve than in earlier VQA models. We suggest a few\nadditional `best-practices' to consider when applying BLP to video-QA. We\nstress that video-QA models should carefully consider where the complex\nrepresentational potential from BLP is actually needed to avoid computational\nexpense on `redundant' fusion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2020 15:01:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-21"}

One important reason for this is a lack of model comprehensibility.\nRecently developed visualization methods for deriving CNN relevance maps may\nhelp to fill this gap. We investigated whether models with higher accuracy also\nrely more on discriminative brain regions predefined by prior knowledge.\n  Methods: We trained a CNN for the detection of AD in N=663 T1-weighted MRI\nscans of patients with dementia and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI)\nand verified the accuracy of the models via cross-validation and in three\nindependent samples including N=1655 cases.

Imputation methods\nfor compositional data are typically applied on additive, centered or isometric\nlog-ratio representations of the data.

Therefore one tries to impute missing values or measurements that were\nbelow a detection limit.

We are also interested in the question whether for ANNs, a\nrepresentation of the data in log-ratios for imputation purposes, is relevant.\nIt can be shown, that ANNs are competitive or even performing better when\nimputing rounded zeros of data sets with moderate size. They deliver better\nresults when data sets are big. Also, we can see that log-ratio transformations\nwithin the artificial neural network imputation procedure nevertheless help to\nimprove the results.

One example is the PIPE\narchitecture extension, which attaches metadata tags to register and memory\nvalues and executes tag-based rules at each machine instruction to enforce a\nsoftware-defined security policy. To use PIPE effectively, engineers should be\nable to write security policies in terms of source-level concepts like\nfunctions, local variables, and structured control operators, which are not\nvisible at machine level. It is the job of the compiler to generate PIPE-aware\nmachine code that enforces these source-level policies. The compiler thus\nbecomes part of the monitored system's trusted computing base -- and hence a\nprime candidate for verification.\n  To formalize compiler correctness in this setting, we extend the source\nlanguage semantics with its own form of user-specified tag-based monitoring,\nand show that the compiler preserves that monitoring behavior. The challenges\nof compilation include mapping source-level monitoring policies to\ninstruction-level tag rules, preserving fail-stop behaviors, and satisfying the\nsurprisingly complex preconditions for conventional optimizations. In this\npaper, we describe the design and verification of Tagine, a small prototype\ncompiler that translates a simple tagged WHILE language to a tagged register\ntransfer language and performs simple optimizations.

However, theoretical basis for Ampere's force law\nand Faraday's law remains unknown to this day. Furthermore, the Lorentz force\nis considered as experimental phenomena, the theoretical foundation of this\nforce is still unknown.\n  To answer these fundamental theoretical questions, we derive Lienard Wiechert\npotentials, Maxwell's equations and Lorentz force from two simple postulates:\n(a) when all charges are at rest the Coulomb's force acts between the charges,\nand (b) that disturbances caused by charge in motion propagate away from the\nsource with finite velocity. The special relativity was not used in our\nderivations nor the Lorentz transformation. In effect, it was shown all the\nelectrodynamic laws, including the Lorentz force, can be derived from Coulomb's\nlaw and time retardation.\n  This was accomplished by analysis of hypothetical experiment where test\ncharge is at rest and where previously moving source charge stops at some time\nin the past. Then the generalized Helmholtz decomposition theorem, also derived\nin this paper, was applied to reformulate Coulomb's force acting at present\ntime as the function of positions of source charge at previous time when the\nsource charge was moving. From this reformulation of Coulomb's law the Lienard\nWiechert potentials and Maxwell's equations were derived.\n  In the second part of this paper, the energy conservation principle valid for\nmoving charges is derived from the knowledge of electrostatic energy\nconservation principle valid for stationary charges.

Relaxing the requirement of data acquisition is a particularly\nattractive research to promote the applications of DECT in a wide range of\nimaging areas. In this work, we design a novel DECT imaging scheme with dual\nquarter scans and propose an efficient method to reconstruct the desired DECT\nimages from dual limited-angle projection data, which enables DECT on imaging\nconfigurations with half-scan and largely reduces scanning angles and radiation\ndoses. We first study the characteristics of image artifacts under dual quarter\nscans scheme, and find that the directional limited-angle artifacts of DECT\nimages are complementarily distributed in image domain because the\ncorresponding X-rays of high- and low-energy scans are orthogonal. Inspired by\nthis finding, a fusion CT image is generated by integrating the limited-angle\nDECT images of dual quarter scans. This strategy largely reduces the\nlimited-angle artifacts and preserves the image edges and inner structures.\nUtilizing the capability of neural network in the modeling of nonlinear\nproblem, a novel Anchor network with single-entry double-out architecture is\ndesigned in this work to yield the desired DECT images from the generated\nfusion CT image.

The Genetic\nalgorithm is modified to be suitable for this type of ANN in which a\nCoarse-level Stochastic Gradient Descent (CSGD) is exploited to make the\ndecision of the offspring qualification. Employing the presented approach, a\nconsiderable improvement in both accuracy and efficiency, compared with\nstandard training algorithms such as classical SGD and Adam optimiser, is\nobserved. The local displacement accuracy is studied and ensured by introducing\nthe results of Finite Element Method (FEM) at sufficiently fine mesh as the\nreference displacements. A slightly more complex problem is solved ensuring its\nfeasibility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2020 10:59:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-17"}

Its core issue\nis how to reconstruct the underlying hyperspectral image using compressive\nsensing reconstruction algorithms. Due to the diversity in the spectral\nresponse characteristics and wavelength range of different spectral imaging\ndevices, previous works are often inadequate to capture complex spectral\nvariations or lack the adaptive capacity to new hyperspectral imagers. In order\nto address these issues, we propose an unsupervised spatial-spectral network to\nreconstruct hyperspectral images only from the compressive snapshot\nmeasurement. The proposed network acts as a conditional generative model\nconditioned on the snapshot measurement, and it exploits the spatial-spectral\nattention module to capture the joint spatial-spectral correlation of\nhyperspectral images. The network parameters are optimized to make sure that\nthe network output can closely match the given snapshot measurement according\nto the imaging model, thus the proposed network can adapt to different imaging\nsettings, which can inherently enhance the applicability of the network.\nExtensive experiments upon multiple datasets demonstrate that our network can\nachieve better reconstruction results than the state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2020 12:29:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 31 Jul 2021 15:14:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-03"}

Computational complexity\nof simulating wireless sensor networks can be very high and as such must be\ncarefully managed. Application-level code prototyping with reasonable accuracy\nand fidelity can be accomplished through simulation that models only the\neffects of the wireless and distributed computations which materialize mainly\nas delay and drop for the messages being exchanged among the motes. This\napproach employs the abstraction that all physical or communication and\nprotocol level operations can be represented in terms of their effects as\nmessage delay and drop at the application level for a wireless sensor network.\nThis study proposes that idea of empirical modeling of delay and drop and\nemploying those models to affect the reception times of wirelessly communicated\nmessages. It further proposes the delay and drop to be modeled as random\nvariables with probability distributions empirically approximated based on the\ndata reported in the literature. The proposed approach is demonstrated through\ndevelopment of a neural network application with neurons distributed across the\nmotes of a wireless sensor network.

Among all\npossible query routing mechanisms, decentralized search, operating purely on\neach expert's local information without any knowledge of network global\nstructure, represents the most basic and scalable routing mechanism, which is\napplicable to any network scenarios even in dynamic networks. However, there is\nstill a lack of fundamental understanding of the efficiency of decentralized\nsearch in expert networks. In this regard, we investigate decentralized search\nby quantifying its performance under a variety of network settings. Our key\nfindings reveal the existence of network conditions, under which decentralized\nsearch can achieve significantly short query routing paths (i.e., between\n$O(\\log n)$ and $O(\\log^2 n)$ hops, $n$: total number of experts in the\nnetwork). Based on such theoretical foundation, we further study how the unique\nproperties of decentralized search in expert networks is related to the\nanecdotal small-world phenomenon. In addition, we demonstrate that\ndecentralized search is robust against estimation errors introduced by\nmisinterpreting the required expertise levels. To the best of our knowledge,\nthis is the first work studying fundamental behaviors of decentralized search\nin expert networks.
