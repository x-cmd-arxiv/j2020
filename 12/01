Its main\ncomponent is a binary composed of two main-sequence stars, one more massive\nthan the Sun and one less massive. The system's bright magnitude led to a\nwealth of astronomical observations over a long period, making it an appealing\ntestbed for stellar physics. In particular, detection of stellar pulsations in\nboth $\\alpha$ Cen A and B has revealed the potential of asteroseismology for\ndetermining its fundamental stellar parameters. Asteroseismic studies have also\nfocused on the presence of a convective core in the A component, but as yet\nwithout definitive confirmation. Progress in the determination of solar surface\nabundances and stellar opacities have yielded new input for stellar theoretical\nmodels. We investigate their impact on a reference system such as $\\alpha$ Cen\nAB. We seek to confirm the presence of a convective core in $\\alpha$ Cen A by\nanalysing the role of different stellar physics and the potential of\nasteroseismic inverse methods. We present a new series of asteroseismic\ncalibrations carried out using forward approach modelling and including updated\nchemical mixture and opacities in the models. We then complement our analysis\nwith help of recent asteroseismic diagnostic tools based on inverse methods\ndeveloped for solar-like stars. The inclusion of an updated chemical mixture --\nthat is less metal-rich -- appears to reduce the predicted asteroseismic masses\nof each component. Neither classical asteroseismic indicators such as frequency\nratios, nor asteroseismic inversions favour the presence of a convective core\nin $\\alpha$ Cen A. The quality of the observational seismic dataset is the main\nlimiting factor to settle the issue. Implementing new observing strategies to\nimprove the precision on the pulsation frequencies would certainly refine the\noutcome of asteroseismology for this binary system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2020 16:00:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-10"}

The use for small bodies of the Solar System requires to consider a\nhierarchical extension of the model, from the CRTBP to the the full $N$\nplanetary problem. The Elliptic Restricted Three Body, which is the first\nnatural extension of the CRTBP, represents already a challenge, since global\nfirst integrals such as the Jacobi constant are not known for this problem. In\nthis paper we extend the classification of the transits occurring close to the\nLagrangian points $L_1,L_2$ of the ERTBP using a combination of the Floquet\ntheory and Birkhoff normalizations.

The use of\ncomputer graphics processing units (GPUs) has greatly accelerated MC simulation\nand allows dose calculation within a few minutes for a typical radiotherapy\ntreatment plan. However, some clinical applications demand real time efficiency\nfor MC dose calculation. To tackle this problem, we have developed a real time,\ndeep learning based dose denoiser that can be plugged into a current GPU based\nMC dose engine to enable real time MC dose calculation. We used two different\nacceleration strategies to achieve this goal: 1) we applied voxel unshuffle and\nvoxel shuffle operators to decrease the input and output sizes without any\ninformation loss, and 2) we decoupled the 3D volumetric convolution into a 2D\naxial convolution and a 1D slice convolution.

In this paper, we show how an appropriate choice of\ndirectional discretization scheme as well as spatial model mesh can help\nalleviate the computational cost, while largely retaining the accuracy. First,\nwe discuss the adaptive ray-tracing scheme implemented in our 3D radiative\ntransfer library Magritte, that adapts the rays to the spatial mesh and uses a\nhierarchical directional discretization based on HEALPix.

Manually checking the influence of all possible\nsmall subsets is computationally infeasible, so we use an approximation to find\nthe most influential subset. Our metric, the \"Approximate Maximum Influence\nPerturbation,\" is based on the classical influence function, and is\nautomatically computable for common methods including (but not limited to) OLS,\nIV, MLE, GMM, and variational Bayes. We provide finite-sample error bounds on\napproximation performance. At minimal extra cost, we provide an exact\nfinite-sample lower bound on sensitivity. We find that sensitivity is driven by\na signal-to-noise ratio in the inference problem, is not reflected in standard\nerrors, does not disappear asymptotically, and is not due to misspecification.\nWhile some empirical applications are robust, results of several influential\neconomics papers can be overturned by removing less than 1% of the sample.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2020 17:05:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 17 Apr 2021 14:11:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 3 Nov 2021 16:58:05 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2023 20:58:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-13"}

Gaussian process based\nactive learning methods for reliability analysis have emerged as a promising\nway for reducing this computational cost. The learning phase of these methods\nconsists in building a Gaussian process surrogate model of the performance\nfunction and using the uncertainty structure of the Gaussian process to enrich\niteratively this surrogate model. For that purpose a learning criterion has to\nbe defined. Then, the estimation of the probability of failure is typically\nobtained by a classification of a population evaluated on the final surrogate\nmodel. Hence, the estimator of the probability of failure holds two different\nuncertainty sources related to the surrogate model approximation and to the\nsampling based integration technique. In this paper, we propose a methodology\nto quantify the sensitivity of the probability of failure estimator to both\nuncertainty sources. This analysis also enables to control the whole error\nassociated to the failure probability estimate and thus provides an accuracy\ncriterion on the estimation. Thus, an active learning approach integrating this\nanalysis to reduce the main source of error and stopping when the global\nvariability is sufficiently low is introduced. The approach is proposed for\nboth a Monte Carlo based method as well as an importance sampling based method,\nseeking to improve the estimation of rare event probabilities.

There has been a long search for a model\nin which monopoles would spontaneously become the building blocks of new\nground-states: the MeSI Hamiltonian is such a model. In spite of its simplicity\nand classical approach, it describes (both spin and oxygen lattice) the\ndouble-layered monopole crystal observed in Tb$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$.

In that work, typical values of\nmodel parameters were adopted. In the present work, we extend that study by\nexploring the effects of uncertainties of parameter values. Such a study is\nalso useful for us to understand the respective roles of various components of\nthe model. These parameters include the mass flux and velocity of AGN wind and\nradiative efficiency in both the hot and cold feedback modes, and the initial\nblack hole (BH) mass. We find that the velocity of AGN wind in the hot mode is\nthe most important quantity to control the typical accretion rate and\nluminosity of AGN, and the mass growth of the BH. The effect of the wind on\nstar formation is less sensitive. Within the limited parameter range explored\nin the current work, a stronger AGN wind suppresses star formation within ~100\npc but enhances star formation beyond this radius, while the star formation\nintegrated over the evolution time and the whole galaxy roughly remain\nunchanged. AGN radiation suppresses the BH accretion in a mild way, but dust is\nnot considered here. Finally, a smaller initial BH mass results in a more\nviolent evolution of the BH accretion rate. The corresponding AGN spends more\ntime in the high-luminosity state and the percentage of BH mass growth is\nhigher.

In this work, we\nconsider the problem of reviewer recruiting with a focus on the scarcity of\nqualified reviewers in large conferences.

These limitations manifest themselves by higher noise and\ndrifts due to insufficient rejection of refractive index fluctuations caused by\nvariation in temperature, solvent concentration, and most prominently,\nnon-specific binding. Diffractometric biosensors overcome these limitations\nwith inherent self-referencing on the submicron scale with no compromise on\nresolution. Despite this highly promising attribute, the field of\ndiffractometric biosensors has only received limited recognition. A major\nreason is the lack of a general quantitative analysis. This hinders comparison\nto other techniques and amongst different diffractometric biosensors. For\nrefractometric biosensors, on the other hand, such a comparison is possible by\nmeans of the refractive index unit (RIU). In this publication, we suggest the\ncoherent surface mass density, $\\Gamma_{\\rm{coh}}$, as a quantity for\nlabel-free diffractometric biosensors with the same purpose as RIU in\nrefractometric sensors. It is easy to translate $\\Gamma_{\\rm{coh}}$ to the\ntotal surface mass density $\\Gamma_{\\rm{tot}}$, which is an important parameter\nfor many assays. We provide a generalized framework to determine\n$\\Gamma_{\\rm{coh}}$ for various diffractometric biosensing arrangements which\nenables quantitative comparison. Additionally, the formalism can be used to\nestimate background scattering in order to further optimize sensor\nconfigurations. Finally, a practical guide with important experimental\nconsiderations is given to enable readers of any background to apply the\ntheory. Therefore, this paper provides a powerful tool for the development of\ndiffractometric biosensors and will help the field to mature and unveil its\nfull potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2020 17:50:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-17"}

To mitigate the spread of the virus, many states in the U.S.\nissued lockdown orders to urge their residents to stay at their homes, avoid\nget-togethers, and minimize physical interactions. While many offline workers\nare experiencing significant challenges performing their duties, digital\ntechnologies have provided ample tools for individuals to continue working and\nto maintain their productivity. Although using digital platforms to build\nresilience in remote work is effective, other aspects of remote work (beyond\nthe continuation of work) should also be considered in gauging true resilience.\nIn this study, we focus on content creators, and investigate how restrictions\nin individual's physical environment impact their online content creation\nbehavior. Exploiting a natural experimental setting wherein four states issued\nstate-wide lockdown orders on the same day whereas five states never issued a\nlockdown order, and using a unique dataset collected from a short video-sharing\nsocial media platform, we study the impact of lockdown orders on content\ncreators' behaviors in terms of content volume, content novelty, and content\noptimism. We combined econometric methods (difference-in-differences\nestimations of a matched sample) with machine learning-based natural language\nprocessing to show that on average, compared to the users residing in\nnon-lockdown states, the users residing in lockdown states create more content\nafter the lockdown order enforcement. However, we find a decrease in the\nnovelty level and optimism of the content generated by the latter group. Our\nfindings have important contributions to the digital resilience literature and\nshed light on managers' decision-making process related to the adjustment of\nemployees' work mode in the long run.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2020 18:05:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-01"}

The\nsituation where the absorption is fully canceled, and the atom thus has been\nturned completely transparent, has been coined electromagnetically induced\ntransparency (EIT). The characteristics of EIT is a narrow transparency window\nassociated with a fluorescence quench at its center frequency, indicating that\ninelastic scattering at this particular point is suppressed. The emergence of\nEIT-like transparency windows is common in waveguide quantum electrodynamics\n(QED) when multiple closely spaced quantum emitters are coupled to a waveguide.\nThe transparency depends on the separation and energy detuning of the atoms. In\nthis work, we study a number of different setups with two-level atoms in\nwaveguide QED that all exhibit EIT-like transparency windows. Unlike the case\nof a genuine three-level atom, no drive fields are required in the systems we\nconsider, and the coherent coupling of energy levels is mediated by the\nwaveguide. We specifically distinguish between systems with genuine EIT-like\ndynamics and those that exhibit a transparency window but lack the fluorescence\nquench. The systems that we consider consist of both small and giant atoms,\nwhich can be experimentally realized with artificial atoms coupled to either\nphotons or phonons.

Classical isostasy, however,\nneglects internal stresses and geoid contributions to topographical support,\nand yields ambiguous predictions of geoid anomalies. Isostasy should instead be\ndefined either by minimizing deviatoric elastic stresses within the elastic\nshell, or by studying the dynamic response of the body in the long-time limit.\nI implement here the first option by formulating Airy isostatic equilibrium as\nthe response of an elastic shell to surface and internal loads. Isostatic\nratios are defined in terms of deviatoric Love numbers which quantify\ndeviations with respect to a fluid state. The Love number approach separates\nthe physics of isostasy from the technicalities of elastic-gravitational\nspherical deformations, and provides flexibility in the choice of the interior\nstructure. Since elastic isostasy is invariant under a global rescaling of the\nshell shear modulus, it can be defined in the fluid shell limit, which reveals\na deep connection with viscous isostasy. If the shell is homogeneous, minimum\nstress isostasy is dual to a variant of elastic isostasy called zero deflection\nisostasy, which is less physical but simpler to compute. Each isostatic model\nis combined with general boundary conditions applied at the surface and bottom\nof the shell, resulting in one-parameter isostatic families. At long\nwavelength, the influence of boundary conditions disappears as all isostatic\nfamilies members yield the same isostatic ratios. At short wavelength,\ntopography is supported by shallow stresses so that Airy isostasy becomes\nsimilar to either pure top or bottom loading.

Using simulation\ndata enhances the performance of the real robot where limited or no real data\nis available.

Feature representation of\nthe data included discrete Fourier transforms, histograms of oriented\ngradients, and graph Laplacians. Various combinations of these features were\nused to train machine learning models that identify individual classes of\ngraphics corruptions and that later were assembled into a single mixed experts\n\"ensemble\" classifier. The ensemble classifier was tested on heldout test sets,\nand produced an accuracy of 84% on the games it had seen before, and 69% on\ngames it had never seen before.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2020 18:34:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-01"}

These\nevaluations become prohibitive if this parametric map is high-dimensional and\ninvolves expensive solution of partial differential equations (PDEs). To tackle\nthis challenge, we propose to construct surrogates for high-dimensional\nPDE-governed parametric maps in the form of projected neural networks that\nparsimoniously capture the geometry and intrinsic low-dimensionality of these\nmaps. Specifically, we compute Jacobians of these PDE-based maps, and project\nthe high-dimensional parameters onto a low-dimensional derivative-informed\nactive subspace; we also project the possibly high-dimensional outputs onto\ntheir principal subspace. This exploits the fact that many high-dimensional\nPDE-governed parametric maps can be well-approximated in low-dimensional\nparameter and output subspace. We use the projection basis vectors in the\nactive subspace as well as the principal output subspace to construct the\nweights for the first and last layers of the neural network, respectively. This\nfrees us to train the weights in only the low-dimensional layers of the neural\nnetwork. The architecture of the resulting neural network captures to first\norder, the low-dimensional structure and geometry of the parametric map.

Great efforts have recently been\nmade on developing new methods for feature selection that handle the above data\ncharacteristics, but almost all methods were evaluated based on performance of\nmodel predictions. However, little attention has been paid to address a\nfundamental question: how appropriate are those evaluation criteria? Most\nfeature selection methods often control the model fit, but the ability to\nidentify meaningful subsets of features cannot be evaluated simply based on the\nprediction accuracy. If tiny changes to the training data would lead to large\nchanges in the chosen feature subset, then many of the biological features that\nan algorithm has found are likely to be a data artifact rather than real\nbiological signal. This crucial need of identifying relevant and reproducible\nfeatures motivated the reproducibility evaluation criterion such as Stability,\nwhich quantifies how robust a method is to perturbations in the data. In our\npaper, we compare the performance of popular model prediction metric MSE and\nproposed reproducibility criterion Stability in evaluating four widely used\nfeature selection methods in both simulations and experimental microbiome\napplications.

We\nthen propagate the BNN-inferred posterior PDFs into ensemble $H_0$ inference,\nusing simulated time delay measurements from a plausible dedicated monitoring\ncampaign. Assuming well-measured time delays and a reasonable set of priors on\nthe environment of the lens, we achieve a median precision of $9.3$\\% per lens\nin the inferred $H_0$. A simple combination of 200 test-set lenses results in a\nprecision of 0.5 $\\textrm{km s}^{-1} \\textrm{ Mpc}^{-1}$ ($0.7\\%$), with no\ndetectable bias in this $H_0$ recovery test. The computation time for the\nentire pipeline -- including the training set generation, BNN training, and\n$H_0$ inference -- translates to 9 minutes per lens on average for 200 lenses\nand converges to 6 minutes per lens as the sample size is increased.

Eri II, which has an absolute magnitude of\nM_V = -7.1, is located at a distance of 339 kpc, just beyond the virial radius\nof the Milky Way. We determine the star formation history of Eri II and measure\nthe structure of the galaxy and its star cluster. We find that a star formation\nhistory consisting of two bursts, constrained to match the spectroscopic\nmetallicity distribution of the galaxy, accurately describes the Eri II stellar\npopulation. The best-fit model implies a rapid truncation of star formation at\nearly times, with >80% of the stellar mass in place before z~6. A small\nfraction of the stars could be as young as 8 Gyr, but this population is not\nstatistically significant; Monte Carlo simulations recover a component younger\nthan 9 Gyr only 15% of the time, where they represent an average of 7 +/- 4% of\nthe population. These results are consistent with theoretical expectations for\nquenching by reionization. The HST depth and angular resolution enable us to\nshow that Eri II's cluster is offset from the center of the galaxy by a\nprojected distance of 23 +/- 3 pc. This offset could be an indication of a\nsmall (~50-75 pc) dark matter core in Eri II. Moreover, we demonstrate that the\ncluster has a high ellipticity of 0.31 +0.05/-0.06 and is aligned with the\norientation of Eri II within 3 +/- 6 degrees, likely due to tides. The stellar\npopulation of the cluster is indistinguishable from that of Eri II itself.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2020 19:00:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-17"}

Our agent collects multi-view data, generates 2D and 3D\npseudo-labels, and fine-tunes its detector in a self-supervised manner.\nExperiments on both indoor and outdoor datasets show that (1) our method\nobtains high-quality 2D and 3D pseudo-labels from multi-view RGB-D data; (2)\nfine-tuning with these pseudo-labels improves the 2D detector significantly in\nthe test environment; (3) training a 3D detector with our pseudo-labels\noutperforms a prior self-supervised method by a large margin; (4) given weak\nsupervision, our method can generate better pseudo-labels for novel objects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2020 19:16:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Mar 2021 08:09:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-30"}

At the heart of the model is the self-driven force that is\napplied to an agent and is directed towards the exit. However, it is not clear\nif the application of this force results in optimal evacuation, especially in\ncomplex environments with obstacles. Here, we develop a deep reinforcement\nlearning algorithm in association with the social force model to train agents\nto find the fastest evacuation path. During training, we penalize every step of\nan agent in the room and give zero reward at the exit. We adopt the Dyna-Q\nlearning approach. We first show that in the case of a room without obstacles\nthe resulting self-driven force points directly towards the exit as in the\nsocial force model and that the median exit time intervals calculated using the\ntwo methods are not significantly different. Then, we investigate evacuation of\na room with one obstacle and one exit. We show that our method produces similar\nresults with the social force model when the obstacle is convex. However, in\nthe case of concave obstacles, which sometimes can act as traps for agents\ngoverned purely by the social force model and prohibit complete room\nevacuation, our approach is clearly advantageous since it derives a policy that\nresults in object avoidance and complete room evacuation without additional\nassumptions. We also study evacuation of a room with multiple exits. We show\nthat agents are able to evacuate efficiently from the nearest exit through a\nshared network trained for a single agent. Finally, we test the robustness of\nthe Dyna-Q learning approach in a complex environment with multiple exits and\nobstacles. Overall, we show that our model can efficiently simulate emergency\nevacuation in complex environments with multiple room exits and obstacles where\nit is difficult to obtain an intuitive rule for fast evacuation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2020 19:34:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-09"}

To address this open\nproblem, in this paper, we study three years of real-world market data from the\nCalifornia ISO energy market. First, we provide a data-driven overview of all\nsubmitted convergence bids (CBs) and analyze the performance of each individual\nconvergence bidder based on the number of their submitted CBs, the number of\nlocations that they placed the CBs, the percentage of submitted supply or\ndemand CBs, the amount of cleared CBs, and their gained profit or loss. Next,\nwe scrutinize the bidding strategies of the 13 largest market players that\naccount for 75\\% of all CBs in the California ISO market. We identify\nquantitative features to characterize and distinguish their different\nconvergence bidding strategies. This analysis results in revealing three\ndifferent classes of CB strategies that are used in practice.

To that end, integer\nlinear programming is fixed-parameter tractable with respect to the primal (or\ndual) treedepth of the Gaifman graph of its constraint matrix and the largest\ncoefficient (in absolute value). Motivated by this, Kouteck\\'y, Levin, and Onn\n[ICALP 2018] asked whether it is possible to extend these result to a more\nbroader class of integer linear programs. More formally, is integer linear\nprogramming fixed-parameter tractable with respect to the incidence treedepth\nof its constraint matrix and the largest coefficient (in absolute value)?\n  We answer this question in negative. In particular, we prove that deciding\nthe feasibility of a system in the standard form, ${A\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b}},\n{\\mathbf{l} \\le \\mathbf{x} \\le \\mathbf{u}}$, is $\\mathsf{NP}$-hard even when\nthe absolute value of any coefficient in $A$ is 1 and the incidence treedepth\nof $A$ is 5. Consequently, it is not possible to decide feasibility in\npolynomial time even if both the assumed parameters are constant, unless\n$\\mathsf{P}=\\mathsf{NP}$. Moreover, we complement this intractability result by\nshowing tractability for natural and only slightly more restrictive settings,\nnamely: (1) treedepth with an additional bound on either the maximum arity of\nconstraints or the maximum number of occurrences of variables and (2) the\nvertex cover number.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2020 20:03:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-02"}

It is about increasing the\nedge-connectivity of a graph by one unit in the cheapest possible way. More\nprecisely, given a $k$-edge-connected graph $G=(V,E)$ and a set of extra edges,\nthe task is to find a minimum cardinality subset of extra edges whose addition\nto $G$ makes the graph $(k+1)$-edge-connected. If $k$ is odd, the problem is\nknown to reduce to the Tree Augmentation Problem (TAP) -- i.e., $G$ is a\nspanning tree -- for which significant progress has been achieved recently,\nleading to approximation factors below $1.5$ (the currently best factor is\n$1.458$).

Indeed,\nonly very recently, Byrka, Grandoni, and Ameli (STOC 2020) managed to obtain\nthe first approximation factor below $2$ for CAP by presenting a\n$1.91$-approximation algorithm based on a method that is disjoint from recent\nadvances for TAP.\n  We first bridge the gap between TAP and CAP, by presenting techniques that\nallow for leveraging insights and methods from TAP to approach CAP.

To develop a better understanding of this mechanism we approach a\ntechnology as a body of knowledge consisting of interlinked inventions.\nTechnological cumulativeness can then be understood as the extent to which\ninventions build on other inventions within that same body of knowledge. The\ncumulativeness of a technology is therefore characterized by the structure of\nits knowledge base, which is different from, but closely related to, the size\nof its knowledge base. We analytically derive equations describing the relation\nbetween the cumulativeness and the size of the knowledge base. In addition, we\nempirically test our ideas for a number of selected technologies, using patent\ndata. Our results suggest that cumulativeness increases proportionally with the\nsize of the knowledge base, at a rate which varies considerably across\ntechnologies. At the same time we find that across technologies, this rate is\ninversely related to the rate of invention over time.

In\nsum, the presented approach allows for an in-depth, systematic analysis of\ncumulativeness variations across technologies and the knowledge dynamics\nunderlying technology development.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2020 21:10:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 May 2021 13:36:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-05"}

Such shuffled data is commonly observed\nin many real world problems. Taking flow cytometry as an example, the measuring\ninstruments may not be able to maintain the correspondence between the samples\nand the measurements. Due to the combinatorial nature of the problem, most\nexisting methods are only applicable when the sample size is small, and limited\nto linear regression models. To overcome such bottlenecks, we propose a new\ncomputational framework -- ROBOT -- for the shuffled regression problem, which\nis applicable to large data and complex nonlinear models. Specifically, we\nreformulate the regression without correspondence as a continuous optimization\nproblem. Then by exploiting the interaction between the regression model and\nthe data correspondence, we develop a hypergradient approach based on\ndifferentiable programming techniques. Such a hypergradient approach\nessentially views the data correspondence as an operator of the regression, and\ntherefore allows us to find a better descent direction for the model parameter\nby differentiating through the data correspondence. ROBOT can be further\nextended to the inexact correspondence setting, where there may not be an exact\nalignment between the input and output data.

In the\n$p$-processor cup game on $n$ cups, there are two players, a filler and an\nemptier, that take turns adding and removing water from a set of $n$ cups. In\neach turn, the filler adds $p$ units of water to the cups, placing at most $1$\nunit of water in each cup, and then the emptier selects $p$ cups to remove up\nto $1$ unit of water from. The emptier's goal is to minimize the backlog, which\nis the height of the fullest cup.\n  The $p$-processor cup game has been studied in many different settings,\ndating back to the late 1960's. All of the past work shares one common\nassumption: that $p$ is fixed. This paper initiates the study of what happens\nwhen the number of available processors $p$ varies over time, resulting in what\nwe call the \\emph{variable-processor cup game}.\n  Remarkably, the optimal bounds for the variable-processor cup game differ\ndramatically from its classical counterpart. Whereas the $p$-processor cup has\noptimal backlog $\\Theta(\\log n)$, the variable-processor game has optimal\nbacklog $\\Theta(n)$. Moreover, there is an efficient filling strategy that\nyields backlog $\\Omega(n^{1 - \\epsilon})$ in quasi-polynomial time against any\ndeterministic emptying strategy.\n  We additionally show that straightforward uses of randomization cannot be\nused to help the emptier. In particular, for any positive constant $\\Delta$,\nand any $\\Delta$-greedy-like randomized emptying algorithm $\\mathcal{A}$, there\nis a filling strategy that achieves backlog $\\Omega(n^{1 - \\epsilon})$ against\n$\\mathcal{A}$ in quasi-polynomial time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2020 21:58:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2021 19:13:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-11"}

Although the debate about the medical\nand ethical problems of immunity passports has been widespread, there has been\nless inspection of the technical foundations of immunity passport schemes.\nThese schemes are envisaged to be used for sharing COVID-19 test and\nvaccination results in general. The most prominent immunity passport schemes\nhave involved a stack of little-known standards, such as Decentralized\nIdentifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) from the World Wide Web\nConsortium (W3C). Our analysis shows that this group of technical identity\nstandards are based on under-specified and often non-standardized documents\nthat have substantial security and privacy issues, due in part to the\nquestionable use of blockchain technology. One concrete proposal for immunity\npassports is even susceptible to dictionary attacks. The use of `cryptography\ntheater' in efforts like immunity passports, where cryptography is used to\nallay the privacy concerns of users, should be discouraged in standardization.\nDeployment of these W3C standards for `self-sovereign identity' in use-cases\nlike immunity passports could just as well lead to a dangerous form identity\ntotalitarianism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2020 22:10:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-02"}

Because of the Peierls-Nabarro force the\ndislocations can oscillate around an equilibrium position with frequency\n$\\omega_0$. The coupling between waves and dislocations is given by the\nPeach-Koehler force. This leads to a wave equation with an inhomogeneous term\nthat involves a differential operator. In the coherent case, a Dyson equation\nfor a mass operator is set up and solved to all orders in perturbation theory\nin independent scattering approximation (ISA). As a result, a complex index of\nrefraction is obtained, from which an effectve wave velocity and attenuation\ncan be read off, for both longitudinal and transverse waves. In the incoherent\ncase a Bethe-Salpeter equation is set up, and solved to leading order in\nperturbation theory in the limit of low frequency and wave number. A diffusion\nequation is obtained and the (frequency-dependent) diffusion coefficient is\nexplicitly calculated. It reduces to the value obtained with energy transfer\narguments at low frequency. An important intermediate step is the obtention of\na Ward-Takahashi identity (WTI) for a wave equation that involves a\ndifferential operator, which is shown to be compatible with the ISA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2020 22:16:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-02"}

Methods: We analyzed data from\npatients who underwent knee MRI evaluation and consequently had arthroscopic\nknee surgery (207 with cartilage defect, 90 without cartilage defect).\nPatients' arthroscopic findings were compared to preoperative MRI images to\nverify the presence or absence of isolated tibiofemoral cartilage defects.

In this work, we introduce two formalisms that determine the\nindividual contributions of normal modes of vibration (phonons) to the\ndiffusion of ions through a solid, based on (i) Nudged Elastic Band (NEB)\ncalculations and (ii) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The results for a\nmodel ion conductor of $\\rm{Ge}$-substituted $\\rm{Li_3PO_4}$\n($\\rm{Li_{3.042}Ge_{0.042}P_{0.958}O_4}$) revealed that more than 87% of the\n$\\rm{Li^+}$ ion diffusion in the lattice originated from a subset of less than\n10% of the vibrational modes with frequencies between 8 and 20 THz. By\ndeliberately exciting a small targeted subset of these contributing modes (less\nthan 1%) to a higher temperature and still keeping the lattice at low\ntemperature, we observed an increase in diffusivity by several orders of\nmagnitude, consistent with what would be observed if the entire material (i.e.,\nall modes) were excited to the same high temperature. This observation suggests\nthat an entire material need not be heated to elevated temperatures to increase\ndiffusivity, but instead only the modes that contribute to diffusion, or more\ngenerally a reaction/transition pathway, need to be excited to elevated\ntemperatures. This new understanding identifies new avenues for increasing\ndiffusivity by engineering the vibrations in a material, and/or increasing\ndiffusivity by external stimuli/excitation of phonons (e.g., via photons or\nother interactions) without necessarily changing the compound chemistry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2020 23:07:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-02"}

From\nspectral and timing analyses we classify it as a Galactic low-mass X-ray binary\n(LMXB) with a black hole (BH) or neutron star (NS) accretor. AT2019wey stayed\nin the low/hard state (LHS) from 2019 December to 2020 August 21, and the\nhard-intermediate state (HIMS) from 2020 August 21 to 2020 November.

From\n2020 June to August, it brightened to $\\sim 20$ mCrab. Spectral features\ncharacteristic of relativistic reflection became prominent. On 2020 August 21,\nthe source left the \"hard line\" on the rms--intensity diagram, and transitioned\nfrom LHS to HIMS. The thermal disk component became comparable to the power-law\ncomponent.

It rose to prominence\nupon detection, three months later, by the Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG)\nmission in its first all-sky survey. X-ray observations reported in Yao et al.\nsuggest that AT2019wey is a Galactic low-mass X-ray binary (LMXB) with a black\nhole (BH) or neutron star (NS) accretor. Here we present ultraviolet, optical,\nnear-infrared, and radio observations of this object. We show that the\ncompanion is a short-period (P < 16 hr) low-mass (< 1 Msun) star. We consider\nAT2019wey to be a candidate BH system since its locations on the L_radio--L_X\nand L_opt--L_X diagrams are closer to BH binaries than NS binaries. We\ndemonstrate that from 2020 June to August, despite the more than 10 times\nbrightening at radio and X-ray wavelengths, the optical luminosity of AT2019wey\nonly increased by 1.3--1.4 times. We interpret the UV/optical emission before\nthe brightening as thermal emission from a truncated disk in a hot accretion\nflow and the UV/optical emission after the brightening as reprocessing of the\nX-ray emission in the outer accretion disk. AT2019wey demonstrates that\ncombining current wide-field optical surveys and SRG provides a way to discover\nthe emerging population of short-period BH LMXB systems with faint X-ray\noutbursts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2020 23:42:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Sep 2021 22:56:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-03"}

This type of problem is computationally\nchallenging because the vector space dimension grows exponentially with the\nphysical system size, and averaging over different configurations of the random\ndisorder is needed to obtain relevant statistical behavior. For each eigenvalue\nproblem, eigenvalues from different regions of the spectrum and their\ncorresponding eigenvectors need to be computed. Traditionally, the interior\neigenstates for a single eigenvalue problem are computed via the\nshift-and-invert Lanczos algorithm. Due to the extremely high memory footprint\nof the LU factorizations, this technique is not well suited for large number of\nspins $L$, e.g., one needs thousands of compute nodes on modern high\nperformance computing infrastructures to go beyond $L = 24$. The matrix-free\napproach does not suffer from this memory bottleneck, however, its scalability\nis limited by a computation and communication imbalance. We present a few\nstrategies to reduce this imbalance and to significantly enhance the\nscalability of the matrix-free eigensolver. To optimize the communication\nperformance, we leverage the consistent space runtime, CSPACER, and show its\nefficiency in accelerating the MBL irregular communication patterns at scale\ncompared to optimized MPI non-blocking two-sided and one-sided RMA\nimplementation variants. The efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed\nalgorithm is demonstrated by computing eigenstates on a massively parallel\nmany-core high performance computer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2020 02:10:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-02"}

First, only the outer\ncodes in AQCTPCs need to satisfy the orthogonal constraint in quantum codes,\nand any classical linear code can be used for the inner, which makes AQCTPCs\nvery easy to construct. Second, most AQCTPCs are highly degenerate, which means\nthey can correct many more errors than their classical TPC counterparts.\nConsequently, we construct several families of AQCs with better parameters than\nknown results in the literature. Third, AQCTPCs can be efficiently decoded\nalthough they are degenerate, provided that the inner and outer codes are\nefficiently decodable.

A 1T-1R synapse, adding a transistor (1T) in series with the memristive\nsynapse (1R), has been proposed to mitigate such non-idealities. We observe\nthat the non-linear characteristics of the transistor affect the overall\nconductance of the 1T-1R cell which in turn affects the\nMatrix-Vector-Multiplication (MVM) operation in crossbars. This 1T-1R\nnon-ideality arising from the input voltage-dependent non-linearity is not only\ndifficult to model or formulate, but also causes a drastic performance\ndegradation of DNNs when mapped onto crossbars. In this paper, we analyse the\nnon-linearity of the 1T-1R crossbar and propose a novel Non-linearity Aware\nTraining (NEAT) method to address the non-idealities. Specifically, we first\nidentify the range of network weights, which can be mapped into the 1T-1R cell\nwithin the linear operating region of the transistor. Thereafter, we regularize\nthe weights of the DNNs to exist within the linear operating range by using\niterative training algorithm. Our iterative training significantly recovers the\nclassification accuracy drop caused by the non-linearity.

Based on\nthis observation, we achieve energy efficiency while preserving classification\naccuracy by applying heterogeneous gate voltage control to the 1T-1R cells\nacross different layers.

The date palm (Phoenix dactylifera L.) is the iconic\nfruit crop of hot and arid regions of North Africa and the Middle East,\nproducing sugar-rich fruits, known as dates. There are many different cultivars\neach with distinctive fruit traits, and there are many wild Phoenix species\ntoo, which in total form a complex of related species. The understanding of\nplant domestication involves multiple disciplines, including phylogeography,\npopulation genetics and archaeology. In the past decade, they have prompted new\ndiscoveries on the evolutionary history of date palm, but a complete\nunderstanding of its origins remains to be elucidated, along with the genetic\narchitecture of its domestication syndrome. In this chapter, we review the\ncurrent state of the art regarding the origins of the domesticated date palm.\nWe first discuss whether date palms are domesticated, and highlight how they\ndiverge from their wild Phoenix relatives. We then outline patterns in the\npopulation genetic and archaeobotanical data, and review different models for\nthe origins of domesticated date palms by highlighting sources of evidence that\nare either consistent or inconsistent with each model. We then review the\nprocess of date palm domestication, and emphasize the human activities that\nhave prompted its domestication. We particularly focus on the evolution of\nfruit traits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2020 05:40:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-02"}

Unlike existing models, FairFaceGAN learns fair\nrepresentations with two separate latents - one related to the target\nattributes to translate, and the other unrelated to them. This strategy enables\nFairFaceGAN to separate the information about protected attributes and that of\ntarget attributes. It also prevents unwanted translation in protected\nattributes while target attributes editing. To evaluate the degree of fairness,\nwe perform two types of experiments on CelebA dataset. First, we compare the\nfairness-aware classification performances when augmenting data by existing\nimage translation methods and FairFaceGAN respectively. Moreover, we propose a\nnew fairness metric, namely Frechet Protected Attribute Distance (FPAD), which\nmeasures how well protected attributes are preserved. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that FairFaceGAN shows consistent improvements in terms of fairness\nover the existing image translation models. Further, we also evaluate image\ntranslation performances, where FairFaceGAN shows competitive results, compared\nto those of existing methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2020 05:43:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2020 05:38:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-03"}

Many prior works in object articulation\nidentification require manipulation of the object, either by the robot or a\nhuman. While recent works have addressed predicting articulation types from\nvisual observations alone, they often assume prior knowledge of category-level\nkinematic motion models or sequence of observations where the articulated parts\nare moving according to their kinematic constraints. In this work, we propose\nFormNet, a neural network that identifies the articulation mechanisms between\npairs of object parts from a single frame of an RGB-D image and segmentation\nmasks. The network is trained on 100k synthetic images of 149 articulated\nobjects from 6 categories. Synthetic images are rendered via a photorealistic\nsimulator with domain randomization. Our proposed model predicts motion\nresidual flows of object parts, and these flows are used to determine the\narticulation type and parameters. The network achieves an articulation type\nclassification accuracy of 82.5% on novel object instances in trained\ncategories. Experiments also show how this method enables generalization to\nnovel categories and be applied to real-world images without fine-tuning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2020 05:59:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 10 Apr 2021 14:15:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 9 Dec 2021 21:46:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-04"}

However, the forecast information inevitably contains errors\nall the time, which degrade the performance of the HVAC operation. Hence, in\nthis study, we propose MILP-based imitation learning method to control a HVAC\nsystem without using the forecast information in order to reduce energy cost\nand maintain thermal comfort at a given level. Our proposed controller is a\ndeep neural network (DNN) trained by using data labeled by a MILP solver with\nhistorical data. After training, our controller is used to control the HVAC\nsystem with real-time data. For comparison, we also develop a second method\nnamed forecast-based MILP which control the HVAC system using the forecast\ninformation. The performance of the two methods is verified by using real\noutdoor temperatures and real day-ahead prices in Detroit city, Michigan,\nUnited States. Numerical results clearly show that the performance of the\nMILP-based imitation learning is better than that of the forecast-based MILP\nmethod in terms of hourly power consumption, daily energy cost, and thermal\ncomfort. Moreover, the difference between results of the MILP-based imitation\nlearning method and optimal results is almost negligible. These optimal results\nare achieved only by using the MILP solver at the end of a day when we have\nfull information on the weather and prices for the day.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2020 06:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-23"}

While\nan individual directly influences only a few neighbors, over time indirect\ninfluences penetrate a much larger group. The abiding question is how this\nspread of influence comes to affect the collective. One or a few individuals\nare often identified as leaders, being more influential than others. Transfer\nentropy and time-delayed mutual information are used to identify underlying\nasymmetric interactions, such as leader-follower classification in aggregated\nindividuals--cells, birds, fish, and animals. However, these conflate distinct\nfunctional modes of information flow between individuals. Computing information\nmeasures conditioning on multiple agents requires the proper sampling of a\nprobability distribution whose dimension grows exponentially with the number of\nagents being conditioned on. Employing simple models of interacting\nself-propelled particles, we examine the pitfalls of using time-delayed mutual\ninformation and transfer entropy to quantify the strength of influence from a\nleader to a follower. Surprisingly, one must be wary of these pitfalls even for\ntwo interacting particles. As an alternative we decompose transfer entropy and\ntime-delayed mutual information into intrinsic, shared, and synergistic modes\nof information flow. The result not only properly reveals the underlying\neffective interactions, but also facilitates a more detailed diagnosis of how\nindividual interactions lead to collective behavior. This exposes the role of\nindividual and group memory in collective behaviors. In addition, we\ndemonstrate in a multi-agent system how knowledge of the decomposed information\nmodes between a single pair of agents reveals the nature of many-body\ninteractions without conditioning on additional agents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2020 06:27:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Apr 2021 10:48:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-12"}

Several works estimate\ndepth/inverse depth by treating the DP pair as a stereo pair. However,\ndual-pixel disparity only occurs in image regions with the defocus blur. The\nheavy defocus blur in DP pairs affects the performance of matching-based depth\nestimation approaches. Instead of removing the blur effect blindly, we study\nthe formation of the DP pair which links the blur and the depth information. In\nthis paper, we propose a mathematical DP model which can benefit depth\nestimation by the blur. These explorations motivate us to propose an end-to-end\nDDDNet (DP-based Depth and Deblur Network) to jointly estimate the depth and\nrestore the image. Moreover, we define a reblur loss, which reflects the\nrelationship of the DP image formation process with depth information, to\nregularise our depth estimate in training. To meet the requirement of a large\namount of data for learning, we propose the first DP image simulator which\nallows us to create datasets with DP pairs from any existing RGBD dataset.

However, the manual annotation of parts in\nlarge scale datasets is time consuming and expensive. In this paper, we aim at\ndiscovering object parts in an unsupervised manner, i.e., without ground-truth\npart or keypoint annotations. Our approach builds on the intuition that objects\nof the same class in a similar pose should have their parts aligned at similar\nspatial locations. We exploit the property that neural network features are\nlargely invariant to nuisance variables and the main remaining source of\nvariations between images of the same object category is the object pose.\nSpecifically, given a training image, we find a set of similar images that show\ninstances of the same object category in the same pose, through an affine\nalignment of their corresponding feature maps. The average of the aligned\nfeature maps serves as pseudo ground-truth annotation for a supervised training\nof the deep network backbone. During inference, part detection is simple and\nfast, without any extra modules or overheads other than a feed-forward neural\nnetwork.

At each round of the algorithm each agent chooses its actions\nfollowing an upper confidence bound (UCB) strategy and agents share information\nwith their immediate neighbors through a carefully designed consensus procedure\nthat repeats over cycles.

However, the\ntemporal modeling methods are not efficient or the 3D efficient architecture is\nless interested in temporal modeling. For bridging the gap between them, we\npropose an efficient temporal modeling 3D architecture, called VoV3D, that\nconsists of a temporal one-shot aggregation (T-OSA) module and depthwise\nfactorized component, D(2+1)D. The T-OSA is devised to build a feature\nhierarchy by aggregating temporal features with different temporal receptive\nfields. Stacking this T-OSA enables the network itself to model short-range as\nwell as long-range temporal relationships across frames without any external\nmodules. Inspired by kernel factorization and channel factorization, we also\ndesign a depthwise spatiotemporal factorization module, named, D(2+1)D that\ndecomposes a 3D depthwise convolution into two spatial and temporal depthwise\nconvolutions for making our network more lightweight and efficient. By using\nthe proposed temporal modeling method (T-OSA), and the efficient factorized\ncomponent (D(2+1)D), we construct two types of VoV3D networks, VoV3D-M and\nVoV3D-L. Thanks to its efficiency and effectiveness of temporal modeling,\nVoV3D-L has 6x fewer model parameters and 16x less computation, surpassing a\nstate-of-the-art temporal modeling method on both Something-Something and\nKinetics-400. Furthermore, VoV3D shows better temporal modeling ability than a\nstate-of-the-art efficient 3D architecture, X3D having comparable model\ncapacity. We hope that VoV3D can serve as a baseline for efficient video\nclassification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2020 07:40:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Dec 2020 06:21:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 22 Apr 2021 01:40:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-23"}

To this end, most existing works exploit this problem\nunder a supervised setting, i.e., using class labels to boost the hashing\nperformance, which suffers from the defects in both adaptivity and efficiency:\nFirst, large amounts of training batches are required to learn up-to-date hash\nfunctions, which leads to poor online adaptivity. Second, the training is\ntime-consuming, which contradicts with the core need of online learning. In\nthis paper, a novel supervised online hashing scheme, termed Fast Class-wise\nUpdating for Online Hashing (FCOH), is proposed to address the above two\nchallenges by introducing a novel and efficient inner product operation. To\nachieve fast online adaptivity, a class-wise updating method is developed to\ndecompose the binary code learning and alternatively renew the hash functions\nin a class-wise fashion, which well addresses the burden on large amounts of\ntraining batches. Quantitatively, such a decomposition further leads to at\nleast 75% storage saving. To further achieve online efficiency, we propose a\nsemi-relaxation optimization, which accelerates the online training by treating\ndifferent binary constraints independently. Without additional constraints and\nvariables, the time complexity is significantly reduced. Such a scheme is also\nquantitatively shown to well preserve past information during updating hashing\nfunctions. We have quantitatively demonstrated that the collective effort of\nclass-wise updating and semi-relaxation optimization provides a superior\nperformance comparing to various state-of-the-art methods, which is verified\nthrough extensive experiments on three widely-used datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2020 07:41:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-02"}

Therefore,\nwe formulate long-tailed visual recognition as a label shift problem where the\ntarget and source label distributions are different. One of the significant\nhurdles in dealing with the label shift problem is the entanglement between the\nsource label distribution and the model prediction. In this paper, we focus on\ndisentangling the source label distribution from the model prediction.

This damping\nhelps to alleviate problems such as thermoacoustic instabilities. During\ncomputational fluid dynamics simulations (CFD) of combustion chambers, these\nsmall-scale features are often neglected as the corresponding increase in the\nmesh cell count augments significantly the cost of simulation while the small\nphysical size of these cells can present problems for the stability of the\nsolver. In problems where acoustics are prevalent and critical to the validity\nof the simulation, the neglected small-scale features and the associated\nreduction in overall acoustic damping can cause problems with spurious,\nnonphysical noise and prevents accurate simulation of transients and limit\ncycle oscillations. Low-order dynamical systems (LODS) and artificial neural\nnetworks (ANNs) are proposed and tested in their ability to represent a simple\ntwo-dimensional acoustically forced simulation of an orifice at multiple\nfrequencies. These models were built using compressible CFD, using OpenFOAM, of\nan orifice placed between two ducts. The acoustic impedance of the orifice has\nbeen computed using the multi-microphone method and compared to a commonly used\nanalytical model. Following this, the flow field downstream of the orifice has\nbeen modelled using both a LODS and ANN model. Both methods have shown the\nability to closely represent the simulated dynamical flows at much lower\ncomputational cost than the original CFD simulation. Such models may also\nassist in the accurate simulation of flame quenching due to cooling flows or\nthe design of effusion cooled aerodynamic surfaces such as nozzle guide vanes\n(NGVs) and turbine blades.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2020 08:43:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Dec 2020 08:50:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-04"}

The results indicate that the matching layer acts as a\nbandpass frequency filter under the two excitation signal types.

All these positive aspects make this\nmaterial promising for large-scale applications of solid-state hydrogen\nstorage. On the other hand, activation and kinetic issues should be amended and\nthe role of elemental substitution should be further understood. This work\ninvestigates the thermodynamic changes induced by the variation of Ti content\nalong the homogeneity range of the TiFe phase (Ti:Fe ratio from 1:1 to 1:0.9)\nand of the substitution of Mn for Fe between 0 and 5 at.%. In all considered\nalloys, the major phase is TiFe-type together with minor amounts of TiFe2 or\n\\b{eta}-Ti-type and Ti4Fe2O-type at the Ti-poor and rich side of the TiFe phase\ndomain, respectively.

In one framework,\nwe use hyperedges to represent many-to-one influence -- the collective\ninfluence of a group of nodes on another node -- and define the hypergraph\ntriggering model as a natural extension to the classical triggering model. In\nanother framework, we use monotone Boolean functions to capture the diverse\nlogic underlying many-to-one influence behaviors, and extend the triggering\nmodel to the Boolean-function triggering model. We prove that the\nBoolean-function triggering model, even with refined details of influence\nlogic, is equivalent to the hypergraph triggering model, and both are\nequivalent to the general threshold model. Moreover, the general threshold\nmodel is optimal in the number of parameters, among all models with the same\nexpressive power. We further extend these three equivalent models by\nintroducing correlations among influence propagations on different nodes.\nSurprisingly, we discover that while the correlated hypergraph-based model is\nstill equivalent to the correlated Boolean-function-based model, the correlated\ngeneral threshold model is more restrictive than the two high-order models.

This problem has received increasing attention in\nrecent years: while several cohesiveness functions have been studied, the bulk\nof the literature looks for a solution subgraphs containing all the query\nvertices. However, in many exploratory analyses we might only have a reasonable\nbelief about the vertices of interest: if only one of them is not really\nrelated to the others, forcing the solution to include all of them might hide\nthe existence of much more cohesive and meaningful subgraphs, that we could\nhave found by allowing the solution to detect and drop the outlier vertex.

However, the determination of its\nshort-term effects on carbon emissions requires the knowledge of marginal\nemission factors (MEFs), which compared to grid mix emission factors (XEFs),\nare cumbersome to calculate due to the complex characteristics of national\nelectricity markets. This study, therefore, proposes two merit order-based\nmethods to approximate hourly MEFs and applies it to readily available datasets\nfrom 20 European countries for the years 2017-2019. Based on the resulting\nelectricity prices, MEFs, and XEFs, standardized daily load shifts were\nsimulated to quantify their effects on marginal costs and carbon emissions.\nFinally, by repeating the load shift simulations for different carbon price\nlevels, the impact of the carbon price on the resulting carbon emissions was\nanalyzed. Interestingly, the simulated price-based load shifts led to increases\nin operational carbon emissions for 8 of the 20 countries and to an average\nincrease of 2.1% across all 20 countries. Switching from price-based to\nMEF-based load shifts reduced the corresponding carbon emissions to a decrease\nof 35%, albeit with 56% lower monetary cost savings compared to the price-based\nload shifts. Under specific circumstances, PBDR leads to an increase in carbon\nemissions, mainly due to the economic advantage fuel sources such as lignite\nand coal have in the merit order. However, as the price of carbon is increased,\nthe correlation between the carbon intensity and the marginal cost of the fuels\nsubstantially increases. Therefore, with adequate carbon prices, PBDR can be an\neffective tool for both economical and environmental improvement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2020 10:04:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-11"}

A self-consistent calculation of the photoionization of the stellar\nwind by the X-rays from the accreting neutron star is included. This effect is\nconvolved with the modulation of the mass accretion rate induced by the\neccentric orbit to obtain the expected X-ray luminosity of a system along the\norbit. As part of our results, we first show that the bi-modality of low and\nhigh X-ray luminosity solutions for supergiant X-ray binaries reported in\nprevious papers is likely to result from the effect of the neutron star\napproaching first and then moving away from the companion (without coexisting\nsimultaneously).

Different\nfrom the 2003 SARS epidemic and the worldwide 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic,\nCOVID-19 has unique epidemiological characteristics in its infectious and\nrecovered compartments. This drives us to formulate a new infectious dynamic\nmodel for forecasting the COVID-19 pandemic within the human mobility network,\nnamed the SaucIR-model in the sense that the new compartmental model extends\nthe benchmark SIR model by dividing the flow of people in the infected state\ninto asymptomatic, pathologically infected but unconfirmed, and confirmed.\nFurthermore, we employ dynamic modeling of population flow in the model in\norder that spatial effects can be incorporated effectively. We forecast the\nspread of accumulated confirmed cases in some provinces of mainland China and\nother countries that experienced severe infection during the time period from\nlate February to early May 2020. The novelty of incorporating the geographic\nspread of the pandemic leads to a surprisingly good agreement with published\nconfirmed case reports. The numerical analysis validates the high degree of\npredictability of our proposed SaucIR model compared to existing resemblance.\nThe proposed forecasting SaucIR model is implemented in Python.

Researchers employed machine learning methods using\nhand-crafted features for seizure prediction. However, ML methods are too\ncomplicated to select the best ML model or best features. Deep Learning methods\nare beneficial in the sense of automatic feature extraction. One of the\nroadblocks for accurate seizure prediction is scarcity of epileptic seizure\ndata. This paper addresses this problem by proposing a deep convolutional\ngenerative adversarial network to generate synthetic EEG samples. We use two\nmethods to validate synthesized data namely, one-class SVM and a new proposal\nwhich we refer to as convolutional epileptic seizure predictor (CESP). Another\nobjective of our study is to evaluate performance of well-known deep learning\nmodels (e.g., VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, and Inceptionv3) by training models on\naugmented data using transfer learning with average time of 10 min between true\nprediction and seizure onset. Our results show that CESP model achieves\nsensitivity of 78.11% and 88.21%, and FPR of 0.27/h and 0.14/h for training on\nsynthesized and testing on real Epilepsyecosystem and CHB-MIT datasets,\nrespectively. Effective results of CESP trained on synthesized data shows that\nsynthetic data acquired the correlation between features and labels very well.\nWe also show that employment of idea of transfer learning and data augmentation\nin patient-specific manner provides highest accuracy with sensitivity of 90.03%\nand 0.03 FPR/h which was achieved using Inceptionv3, and that augmenting data\nwith samples generated from DCGAN increased prediction results of our CESP\nmodel and Inceptionv3 by 4-5% as compared to state-of-the-art traditional\naugmentation techniques. Finally, we note that prediction results of CESP\nachieved by using augmented data are better than chance level for both\ndatasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2020 12:00:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-02"}

As clusters might contain a large number of objects,\nhaving a representative for each cluster significantly facilitates\nunderstanding a clustering. Clustering methods relying on such representatives\nare called center-based. In this work we consider the problem of center-based\nclustering of trajectories.\n  In this setting, the representative of a cluster is again a trajectory. To\nobtain a compact representation of the clusters and to avoid overfitting, we\nrestrict the complexity of the representative trajectories by a parameter l.\nThis restriction, however, makes discrete distance measures like dynamic time\nwarping (DTW) less suited.\n  There is recent work on center-based clustering of trajectories with a\ncontinuous distance measure, namely, the Fr\\'echet distance. While the\nFr\\'echet distance allows for restriction of the center complexity, it can also\nbe sensitive to outliers, whereas averaging-type distance measures, like DTW,\nare less so. To obtain a trajectory clustering algorithm that allows\nrestricting center complexity and is more robust to outliers, we propose the\nusage of a continuous version of DTW as distance measure, which we call\ncontinuous dynamic time warping (CDTW). Our contribution is twofold:\n  1. To combat the lack of practical algorithms for CDTW, we develop an\napproximation algorithm that computes it.\n  2. We develop the first clustering algorithm under this distance measure and\nshow a practical way to compute a center from a set of trajectories and\nsubsequently iteratively improve it.\n  To obtain insights into the results of clustering under CDTW on practical\ndata, we conduct extensive experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2020 13:17:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-02"}

The\nsubmatrix $W^k$ is obtained computing the affinity between all triangles and\nonly a few special triangles: those which are farthest in the defined metric.\nThis is equivalent to select a sample of columns of $W$ without constructing it\ncompletely. The proposed method is computationally cheaper than other\nsegmentation algorithms, since it only calculates few columns of $W$ and it\ndoes not require the eigendecomposition of $W$ or of any submatrix of $W$.\n  We prove that the orthogonal projection of $W$ on the space generated by the\ncolumns of $W^k$ coincides with the orthogonal projection of $W$ on the space\ngenerated by the $k$ eigenvectors computed by Nystr\\\"om's method using the\ncolumns of $W^k$ as a sample of $W$. Further, it is shown that for increasing\nsize $k$, the proximity relationship among the rows of $W^k$ tends to\nfaithfully reflect the proximity among the corresponding rows of $W$.\n  The FSS method does not depend on parameters that must be tuned by hand and\nit is very flexible, since it can handle any metric to define the distance\nbetween triangles. Numerical experiments with several metrics and a large\nvariety of 3D triangular meshes show that the segmentations obtained computing\nless than the 10% of columns $W$ are as good as those obtained from clustering\nthe rows of the full matrix $W$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2020 13:31:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-02"}

In a seminal work, Kenyon [SODA 1996] introduced the\n(asymptotic) random order ratio as an alternative performance measure for\nonline algorithms. Here, an adversary specifies the items, but the order of\narrival is drawn uniformly at random. Kenyon's result establishes lower and\nupper bounds of 1.08 and 1.5, respectively, for the random order ratio of Best\nFit. Although this type of analysis model became increasingly popular in the\nfield of online algorithms, no progress has been made for the Best Fit\nalgorithm after the result of Kenyon.\n  We study the random order ratio of Best Fit and tighten the long-standing gap\nby establishing an improved lower bound of 1.10. For the case where all items\nare larger than 1/3, we show that the random order ratio converges quickly to\n1.25. It is the existence of such large items that crucially determines the\nperformance of Best Fit in the general case. Moreover, this case is closely\nrelated to the classical maximum-cardinality matching problem in the fully\nonline model. As a side product, we show that Best Fit satisfies a monotonicity\nproperty on such instances, unlike in the general case.\n  In addition, we initiate the study of the absolute random order ratio for\nthis problem. In contrast to asymptotic ratios, absolute ratios must hold even\nfor instances that can be packed into a small number of bins.

These occur as convolutions of the DNA profiles of\nthe individual contributors to the DNA sample. Thus, in cases where one or more\nof the contributors were unknown, an objective of interest would be the\nseparation, often called deconvolution, of these unknown profiles. In order to\nobtain deconvolutions of the unknown DNA profiles, we introduced a multiple\npopulation evolutionary algorithm (MEA). We allowed the mutation operator of\nthe MEA to utilise that the fitness is based on a probabilistic model and guide\nit by using the deviations between the observed and the expected value for\nevery element of the encoded individual. This guided mutation operator (GM) was\ndesigned such that the larger the deviation the higher probability of mutation.\nFurthermore, the GM was inhomogeneous in time, decreasing to a specified lower\nbound as the number of iterations increased. We analysed 102 two-person DNA\nmixture samples in varying mixture proportions. The samples were quantified\nusing two different DNA prep. kits: (1) Illumina ForenSeq Panel B (30 samples),\nand (2) Applied Biosystems Precision ID Globalfiler NGS STR panel (72 samples).\nThe DNA mixtures were deconvoluted by the MEA and compared to the true DNA\nprofiles of the sample. We analysed three scenarios where we assumed: (1) the\nDNA profile of the major contributor was unknown, (2) DNA profile of the minor\nwas unknown, and (3) both DNA profiles were unknown. Furthermore, we conducted\na series of sensitivity experiments on the ForenSeq panel by varying the\nsub-population size, comparing a completely random homogeneous mutation\noperator to the guided operator with varying mutation decay rates, and allowing\nfor hill-climbing of the parent population.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2020 14:23:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-02"}

The efficiency of the processing relies on the precise control of the\nmechanism, which has yet to be established. Here, we theoretically demonstrate\na new route to drive the electron displacement on a timescale faster than that\nof the dynamical distortion of the electron wavepacket by utilizing attosecond\nsingle-cycle pulses. The characteristic feature of these pulses relies on a\nvast momentum transfer to an electron, leading to its displacement following a\nunidirectional path. The scenario is illustrated by revealing the\nspatiotemporal nature of the displaced wavepacket encoding a quantum\nsuperposition state. We map out the associated phase information and retrieve\nit over long distances from the origin. Moreover, we show that a sequence of\nsuch pulses applied to a chain of ions enables attosecond control of the\ndirectionality of the coherent motion of the electron wavepacket back and forth\nbetween the neighbouring sites. An extension to a two-electron spin state\ndemonstrates the versatility of the use of these pulses.

First, we show that adversarial\ntraining, which is successful against imperceptible attacks, has limited\neffectiveness against state-of-the-art location-optimized patch attacks.\nSecond, we find that compositional deep networks, which have part-based\nrepresentations that lead to innate robustness to natural occlusion, are robust\nto patch attacks on PASCAL3D+ and the German Traffic Sign Recognition\nBenchmark, without adversarial training.

Most of the existing feature selection methods are computationally\ninefficient; inefficient algorithms lead to high energy consumption, which is\nnot desirable for devices with limited computational and energy resources. In\nthis paper, a novel and flexible method for unsupervised feature selection is\nproposed. This method, named QuickSelection, introduces the strength of the\nneuron in sparse neural networks as a criterion to measure the feature\nimportance. This criterion, blended with sparsely connected denoising\nautoencoders trained with the sparse evolutionary training procedure, derives\nthe importance of all input features simultaneously. We implement\nQuickSelection in a purely sparse manner as opposed to the typical approach of\nusing a binary mask over connections to simulate sparsity. It results in a\nconsiderable speed increase and memory reduction. When tested on several\nbenchmark datasets, including five low-dimensional and three high-dimensional\ndatasets, the proposed method is able to achieve the best trade-off of\nclassification and clustering accuracy, running time, and maximum memory usage,\namong widely used approaches for feature selection.

When all\nthe spins are initially in the direction of transverse field, both the time\nperiod and critical time exhibit logarithmic or power-law divergences depending\non the final field strength. In the case of convergence, we provide estimates\nfor the finite-size scaling and converged value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2020 15:09:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-06"}

It\nmodifies the geometry of an initial manifold mesh to minimize the photometric\nerror induced in a set of camera pairs. This initial mesh is usually the output\nof volumetric 3D reconstruction based on min-cut over Delaunay Triangulations.\nSuch methods produce a significant amount of non-manifold vertices, therefore\nthey require a vertex split step to explicitly repair them. In this paper, we\nextend this method to preemptively fix the non-manifold vertices by reasoning\ndirectly on the Delaunay Triangulation and avoid most vertex splits. The main\ncontribution of this paper addresses the problem of choosing the camera pairs\nadopted by the refinement process. We treat the problem as a mesh labeling\nprocess, where each label corresponds to a camera pair. Differently from the\nstate-of-the-art methods, which use each camera pair to refine all the visible\nparts of the mesh, we choose, for each facet, the best pair that enforces both\nthe overall visibility and coverage. The refinement step is applied for each\nfacet using only the camera pair selected. This facetwise refinement helps the\nprocess to be applied in the most evenly way possible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2020 15:16:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-02"}

Decentralized architectures can\nreduce these requirements by pre-processing the data before it arrives at a\ncentral processing unit (CPU).

To do so, we propose a general\nframework for centralized/decentralized architectures that can explore said\ninterplay by adjusting some system parameters, namely the number of connections\nto the CPU (level of decentralization), and the number of\nmultiplications/outputs per antenna (complexity/interconnection bandwidth).

First, this paper established a multi-layer\nperceptron predictive model of employee turnover rate. A model based on Sarsa\nwhich is a kind of reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to\nautomatically generate a set of strategies to reduce the employee turnover\nrate. These strategies are a collection of strategies that can reduce the\nemployee turnover rate the most and cost less from the perspective of the\nenterprise, and can be used as a reference plan for the enterprise to optimize\nthe employee system. The experimental results show that the algorithm can\nindeed improve the efficiency and accuracy of the specific strategy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2020 15:48:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-02"}

Our results cover those cut and project schemes for which\nthe lattice projects densely into the internal space and (possibly after\ntranslation) hits each supporting hyperplane of the polytopal window. Our main\nresult is that LR is satisfied if and only if the patterns are of low\ncomplexity (property C), and the projected lattice satisfies a Diophantine\ncondition (property D). Property C can be checked by computation of the ranks\nand dimensions of linear spans of the stabiliser subgroups of the supporting\nhyperplanes, as investigated in Part I to this article. To define the correct\nDiophantine condition D, we establish new results on decomposing polytopal cut\nand project schemes to factors, developing concepts initiated in the work of\nForrest, Hunton and Kellendonk. This means that, when C is satisfied, the\nwindow splits into components which induce a compatible splitting of the\nlattice. Then property D is the requirement that, for any suitable\ndecomposition, these factors do not project close to the origin in the internal\nspace, relative to the norm in the total space. On each factor, this\ncorresponds to the usual notion from Diophantine Approximation of a system of\nlinear forms being badly approximable. This extends previous work on cubical\ncut and project schemes to a very general class of cut and project schemes. We\ndemonstrate our main theorem on several examples, and derive some further\nconsequences of our main theorem, such as the equivalence LR, positivity of\nweights and satisfying a subadditive ergodic theorem for this class of\npolytopal cut and project sets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2020 15:59:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-02"}

However, a lack of policy interpretability\ncan inhibit their successful deployment in downstream applications,\nparticularly when differences in environmental conditions may result in\nunpredictable behaviour or generalisation failures. As a result, there has been\na growing emphasis in machine learning around the inclusion of stronger\ninductive biases in models to improve generalisation. This paper proposes an\nalternative strategy, inverse value estimation for interpretable policy\ncertificates (IV-Posterior), which seeks to identify the inductive biases or\nidealised conditions of operation already held by pre-trained policies, and\nthen use this information to guide their deployment. IV-Posterior uses\nMaskedAutoregressive Flows to fit distributions over the set of conditions or\nenvironmental parameters in which a policy is likely to be effective. This\ndistribution can then be used as a policy certificate in downstream\napplications. We illustrate the use of IV-Posterior across a two environments,\nand show that substantial performance gains can be obtained when policy\nselection incorporates knowledge of the inductive biases that these policies\nhold.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2020 21:45:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-04"}

A GMBL program specifies (1) how to parameterize geometric objects\n(or sets of geometric objects) and initialize these parameterized quantities,\n(2) which quantities to compute directly from other quantities, and (3)\nadditional constraints to accumulate into a (differentiable) loss function. A\nGMBL program induces a (usually) tractable numerical optimization problem whose\nsolutions correspond to diagrams of the original problem statement, and that we\ncan solve reliably using gradient descent. Of the 39 geometry problems since\n2000 appearing in the International Mathematical Olympiad, 36 can be expressed\nin our logic and our system can produce diagrams for 94% of them on average. To\nthe best of our knowledge, our method is the first in automated geometry\ndiagram construction to generate models for such complex problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2020 05:56:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 1 May 2021 00:41:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-04"}

In this\npaper, we describe a machine learning system that matches translator requests\nto volunteers at scale.

To be able to better explore\ntissue morphology it is useful to stitch sequentially acquired frames into a\nmosaic. However, low frame rates limit the maximum probe translation speed.\nLine-scanning confocal endomicroscopy provides higher frame rates, but residual\nout-of-focus light degrades images. Subtraction based approaches can suppress\nthis residue at the expense of introducing motion artifacts.\n  Aim: To generate high frame rate endomicroscopy images with improved optical\nsectioning, we develop a high-speed subtraction method that only requires the\nacquisition of a single camera frame.\n  Approach: The rolling shutter of a CMOS camera acts as both the aligned and\noffset detector slits required for subtraction-based sectioning enhancement.\nTwo images of the bundle are formed on different regions of the camera,\nallowing both images to be acquired simultaneously.\n  Results: We confirm improved optical sectioning compared to conventional\nline-scanning, particularly far from focus, and show that motion artifacts are\nnot introduced. We demonstrate high-speed mosaicing at frame rates of up to 240\nHz.\n  Conclusion: High-speed acquisition of optically sectioned images using the\nnew subtraction based approach leads to improved mosaicing at high frame rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2020 22:17:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-14"}

To improve the performance of SLU\nmodels on tasks with noisy and low training resources, we propose a new SLU\nbenchmarking task: few-shot robust SLU, where SLU comprises two core problems,\nintent classification (IC) and slot labeling (SL). We establish the task by\ndefining few-shot splits on three public IC/SL datasets, ATIS, SNIPS, and TOP,\nand adding two types of natural noises (adaptation example missing/replacing\nand modality mismatch) to the splits. We further propose a novel noise-robust\nfew-shot SLU model based on prototypical networks. We show the model\nconsistently outperforms the conventional fine-tuning baseline and another\npopular meta-learning method, Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML), in terms of\nachieving better IC accuracy and SL F1, and yielding smaller performance\nvariation when noises are present.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2020 18:53:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-15"}

In recent years, the nearest neighbor methods and\nprobabilistic data association filters were proposed. However, the performance\nof these methods diminishes as the number of measurements increases. In this\npaper, we propose a robust generative approach to effectively model multiple\nsensor measurements for tracking a moving target in an environment with high\nclutter. We assume a time-dependent number of measurements that include sensor\nobservations with unknown origin, some of which may only contain clutter with\nno additional information. We robustly and accurately estimate the trajectory\nof the moving target in a high clutter environment with an unknown number of\nclutters by employing Bayesian nonparametric modeling. In particular, we employ\na class of joint Bayesian nonparametric models to construct the joint prior\ndistribution of target and clutter measurements such that the conditional\ndistributions follow a Dirichlet process. The marginalized Dirichlet process\nprior of the target measurements is then used in a Bayesian tracker to estimate\nthe dynamically-varying target state. We show through experiments that the\ntracking performance and effectiveness of our proposed framework are increased\nby suppressing high clutter measurements. In addition, we show that our\nproposed method outperforms existing methods such as nearest neighbor and\nprobability data association filters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2020 18:32:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-18"}

Different susceptors geometries and coupling\nslit position were numerically tested in order to better understand how these\nparameters impact the field homogeneity and the process stability. It was found\nthat positioning the largest surface of the susceptors parallel to the\nelectrical field allows a very uniform and hybrid heating of the material,\nwhile avoiding plasma or thermal instabilities. This was correlated to the 3 D\nmodeling results. Finally, thanks to a fully automatized system this apparatus\nwas used to sinter large size (~30 cm 3) low-loss dielectric alumina samples.\nThe sintered materials were subsequently characterized in terms of density,\ngrains size distribution and homogeneity.
