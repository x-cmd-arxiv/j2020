On the other hand, general linear maps, such\nas positive but not completely positive maps, which can not be physically\nimplemented, are fundamental ingredients in quantum information, both in\ntheoretical and practical perspectives. This raises the question of how well\none can simulate or approximate the action of a general linear map by\nphysically implementable operations. In this work, we introduce a systematic\nframework to resolve this task using the quasiprobability decomposition\ntechnique. We decompose a target linear map into a linear combination of\nphysically implementable operations and introduce the physical implementability\nmeasure as the least amount of negative portion that the quasiprobability must\npertain, which directly quantifies the cost of simulating a given map using\nphysically implementable quantum operations. We show this measure is\nefficiently computable by semidefinite programs and prove several properties of\nthis measure, such as faithfulness, additivity, and unitary invariance. We\nderive lower and upper bounds in terms of the Choi operator's trace norm and\nobtain analytic expressions for several linear maps of practical interests.\nFurthermore, we endow this measure with an operational meaning within the\nquantum error mitigation scenario: it establishes the lower bound of the\nsampling cost achievable via the quasiprobability decomposition technique. In\nparticular, for parallel quantum noises, we show that global error mitigation\nhas no advantage over local error mitigation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Dec 2020 16:03:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Dec 2021 08:38:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-08"}

We show that a DeMorgan circuit is\nhazard-free if and only if the circuit produces (purely syntactically) all\nprime implicants as well as all prime implicates of the Boolean function it\ncomputes. This extends to arbitrary DeMorgan circuits a classical result of\nEichelberger [IBM J. Res. Develop., 9 (1965)] showing this property for special\ndepth-two circuits. Via an amazingly simple proof, we also strengthen a recent\nresult Ikenmeyer et al. [J. ACM, 66:4 (2019)]: not only the complexities of\nhazard-free and monotone circuits for monotone Boolean functions do coincide,\nbut every optimal hazard-free circuit for a monotone Boolean function must be\nmonotone. Then we show that hazard-free circuit complexity of a very simple\n(non-monotone) Boolean function is super-polynomially larger than its\nunrestricted circuit complexity. This function accepts a Boolean n x n matrix\niff every row and every column has exactly one 1-entry.

With the present study, we\nreport the quantitative assessment of contact patterns in a village in rural\nMalawi, based on proximity sensors technology that allows for high-resolution\nmeasurements of social contacts. The system provided information on community\nstructure of the village, on social relationships and social assortment between\nindividuals, and on daily contacts activity within the village. Our findings\nrevealed that the social network presented communities that were highly\ncorrelated with household membership, thus confirming the importance of family\nties within the village. Contacts within households occur mainly between adults\nand children, and adults and adolescents. This result suggests that the\nprincipal role of adults within the family is the care for the youngest. Most\nof the inter-household interactions occurred among caregivers and among\nadolescents. We studied the tendency of participants to interact with\nindividuals with whom they shared similar attributes (i.e., assortativity). Age\nand gender assortativity were observed in inter-household network, showing that\nindividuals not belonging to the same family group prefer to interact with\npeople with whom they share similar age and gender. Age disassortativity is\nobserved in intra-household networks. Family members congregate in the early\nmorning, during lunch time and dinner time. In contrast, individuals not\nbelonging to the same household displayed a growing contact activity from the\nmorning, reaching a maximum in the afternoon. The data collection\ninfrastructure used in this study seems to be very effective to capture the\ndynamics of contacts by collecting high resolution temporal data and to give\naccess to the level of information needed to understand the social context of\nthe village.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Dec 2020 17:49:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-22"}

Moreover we prove that these algebras generate the\nso-called minimal varieties of polynomial growth.\n  In the last part of the paper, devoted to the study of varieties of\npolynomial growth, we completely classify the subvarieties of the varieties of\nalgebras of almost polynomial growth introduced in an earlier paper of the same\nauthors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Dec 2020 18:52:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-22"}

While existing works\nstrive to find a single solution to the pose estimation problem, we make peace\nwith the ambiguities causing high uncertainty around which solutions to\nidentify as the best. Instead, we report a family of poses which capture the\nnature of the solution space. DBN extends the state of the art direct pose\nregression networks by (i) a multi-hypotheses prediction head which can yield\ndifferent distribution modes; and (ii) novel loss functions that benefit from\nBingham distributions on rotations. This way, DBN can work both in unambiguous\ncases providing uncertainty information, and in ambiguous scenes where an\nuncertainty per mode is desired. On a technical front, our network regresses\ncontinuous Bingham mixture models and is applicable to both 2D data such as\nimages and to 3D data such as point clouds.

Thereby, CTMs allow not only variance,\nkurtosis or skewness but the complete conditional distribution to depend on the\nexplanatory variables. We propose a Bayesian notion of conditional\ntransformation models (BCTMs) focusing on exactly observed continuous\nresponses, but also incorporating extensions to randomly censored and discrete\nresponses. Rather than relying on Bernstein polynomials that have been\nconsidered in likelihood-based CTMs, we implement a spline-based\nparametrization for monotonic effects that are supplemented with smoothness\npriors.

To guarantee important mechanical properties of the latter, the\ntolerances on deviations of the tensioned cable net geometry from the desired\ntarget form are very tight. Therefore, the form needs to be readjusted on the\nconstruction site. In order to employ model-based optimization techniques, the\nprecise identification of important uncertain model parameters of the cable net\nsystem is required. This paper proposes the use of Gaussian process regression\nto learn the function that maps the cable net geometry to the uncertain\nparameters. In contrast to previously proposed methods, this approach requires\nonly a single form measurement for the identification of the cable net model\nparameters. This is beneficial since measurements of the cable net form on the\nconstruction site are very expensive. For the training of the Gaussian\nprocesses, simulated data is efficiently computed via convex programming.

Theoretical results\non multispecies ecosystems points that interspecies interactions modify the\nspatial scale of population synchrony. In particular, recent results on two\nspecies ecosystems, for two competitors and for predator-prey, point that the\nspatial scale of population synchrony generally increases as the fluctuations\npropagates through the food web, i.e., the species more directly affected by\nenvironmental fluctuations presents the smaller spatial scale of population\nsynchrony.

Using a first-order perturbative\ntheory, we derive magnetic splittings of their frequencies as explicit\nfunctions of stellar parameters. As in the case of rotation, we show how\nasymptotic gravity and acoustic modes can allow us to probe the different\ncomponents of the magnetic field in the cavities where they propagate. This\ndemonstrates again the high potential of using mixed-modes when this is\npossible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Dec 2020 23:29:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-24"}

Within this paper, a Bayesian source\nlocalisation strategy that is robust to these complexities is presented. Under\nthis new framework, a Gaussian process is first used to learn the relationship\nbetween source locations and the corresponding difference-in-time-of-arrival\nvalues for a number of sensor pairings. As an acoustic emission event with an\nunknown origin is observed, a mapping is then generated that quantifies the\nlikelihood of the emission location across the surface of the structure.

Geometric mechanics\nprovides means for reduction of the dynamics by environmental homogeneity,\nwhile the dissipative nature minimizes the role of second order (inertial)\nfeatures in the dynamics. Here we extend the tools of geometric system\nidentification to ``Shape-Underactuated Dissipative Systems (SUDS)'' -- systems\nwhose motions are more dissipative than inertial, but whose actuation is\nrestricted to a subset of the body shape coordinates.\n  Many animal motions are SUDS, including micro-swimmers such as nematodes and\nflagellated bacteria, and granular locomotors such as snakes and lizards.

To achieve stabilization, various methods can be applied.\nProportional Feedback control suggests a proportional reduction of the state\nvariable at every $k$th step. First, if $k \\neq 1$, a cycle is stabilized\nrather than an equilibrium. Second, the equation can incorporate an additive\nnoise term, describing the variability of the environment, as well as\nmultiplicative noise corresponding to possible deviations in the control\nintensity. The present paper deals with both issues, it justifies a possibility\nof getting a stable blurred $k$-cycle. Presented examples include the Ricker\nmodel, as well as equations with unbounded $f$, such as the bobwhite quail\npopulation models.

To reason about the best next measurement, SD methods usually\nrequire a sample of possible fault explanations at each step of the iterative\ndiagnostic process. The computation of this sample can be accomplished by\nvarious diagnostic search algorithms. Among those, Reiter's HS-Tree is one of\nthe most popular due its desirable properties and general applicability.\nUsually, HS-Tree is used in a stateless fashion throughout the SD process to\n(re)compute a sample of possible fault explanations in each iteration, each\ntime given the latest (updated) system knowledge including all so-far collected\nmeasurements. At this, the built search tree is discarded between two\niterations, although often large parts of the tree have to be rebuilt in the\nnext iteration, involving redundant operations and calls to costly reasoning\nservices.\n  As a remedy to this, we propose DynamicHS, a variant of HS-Tree that\nmaintains state throughout the diagnostic session and additionally embraces\nspecial strategies to minimize the number of expensive reasoner invocations. In\nthis vein, DynamicHS provides an answer to a longstanding question posed by\nRaymond Reiter in his seminal paper from 1987.\n  Extensive evaluations on real-world diagnosis problems prove the\nreasonability of the DynamicHS and testify its clear superiority to HS-Tree\nwrt. computation time. More specifically, DynamicHS outperformed HS-Tree in 96%\nof the executed sequential diagnosis sessions and, per run, the latter required\nup to 800% the time of the former. Remarkably, DynamicHS achieves these\nperformance improvements while preserving all desirable properties as well as\nthe general applicability of HS-Tree.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2020 01:59:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-22"}

The past few years have\nwitnessed the popularity of the graph-based nearest neighbor search paradigm\nbecause of its superiority over the space-partitioning algorithms. While a lot\nof empirical studies demonstrate the efficiency of graph-based algorithms, not\nmuch attention has been paid to a more fundamental question: why graph-based\nalgorithms work so well in practice? And which data property affects the\nefficiency and how? In this paper, we try to answer these questions. Our\ninsight is that \"the probability that the neighbors of a point o tends to be\nneighbors in the KNN graph\" is a crucial data property for query efficiency.\nFor a given dataset, such a property can be qualitatively measured by\nclustering coefficient of the KNN graph. To show how clustering coefficient\naffects the performance, we identify that, instead of the global connectivity,\nthe local connectivity around some given query q has more direct impact on\nrecall. Specifically, we observed that high clustering coefficient makes most\nof the k nearest neighbors of q sit in a maximum strongly connected component\n(SCC) in the graph. From the algorithmic point of view, we show that the search\nprocedure is actually composed of two phases - the one outside the maximum SCC\nand the other one in it, which is different from the widely accepted single or\nmultiple paths search models. We proved that the commonly used graph-based\nsearch algorithm is guaranteed to traverse the maximum SCC once visiting any\npoint in it. Our analysis reveals that high clustering coefficient leads to\nlarge size of the maximum SCC, and thus provides good answer quality with the\nhelp of the two-phase search procedure. Extensive empirical results over a\ncomprehensive collection of datasets validate our findings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2020 02:18:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-22"}

Local thermal\ninstability in the hot gas leads to the formation of precipitating cold gas\nclouds that feed the central supermassive black holes, thus heating the hot gas\nand maintaining global thermal equilibrium. We perform three dimensional MHD\nsimulations of self-regulated AGN feedback in a Perseus-like galaxy cluster\nwith the aim of understanding the impact of the feedback physics on the\nturbulence properties of the hot and cold phases of the ICM. We find that, in\ngeneral, the cold phase velocity structure function (VSF) is steeper than the\nprediction from Kolmogorov's theory. We attribute the physical origin of the\nsteeper slope of the cold phase VSF to the driving of turbulent motions\nprimarily by the gravitational acceleration acting on the ballistic clouds. We\ndemonstrate that, in the pure hydrodynamical case, the precipitating cold\nfilaments may be the dominant agent driving turbulence in the hot ICM. The\narguments in favor of this hypothesis are that: (i) the cold phase mass\ndominates over hot gas mass in the inner cool core; (ii) hot and cold gas\nvelocities are spatially correlated; (iii) both the cold and hot phase velocity\ndistributions are radially biased. We show that, in the MHD case, the\nturbulence in the ambient hot medium (excluding the jet cone regions) can also\nbe driven by the AGN jets. The driving is then facilitated by enhanced coupling\ndue to magnetic fields of the ambient gas and the AGN jets. In the MHD case,\nturbulence may thus be driven by a combination of AGN jet stirring and filament\nmotions. We conclude that future observations, including those from high\nspatial and spectral resolution X-ray missions, may help to constrain\nself-regulated AGN feedback by quantifying the multi-temperature VSF in the\nICM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2020 02:32:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-14"}

Recent data mixing based augmentation strategies have\nachieved great success. Especially, CutMix uses a simple but effective method\nto improve the classifiers by randomly cropping a patch from one image and\npasting it on another image. To further promote the performance of CutMix, a\nseries of works explore to use the saliency information of the image to guide\nthe mixing. We systematically study the importance of the saliency information\nfor mixing data, and find that the saliency information is not so necessary for\npromoting the augmentation performance. Furthermore, we find that the cutting\nbased data mixing methods carry two problems of label misallocation and object\ninformation missing, which cannot be resolved simultaneously. We propose a more\neffective but very easily implemented method, namely ResizeMix. We mix the data\nby directly resizing the source image to a small patch and paste it on another\nimage. The obtained patch preserves more substantial object information\ncompared with conventional cut-based methods. ResizeMix shows evident\nadvantages over CutMix and the saliency-guided methods on both image\nclassification and object detection tasks without additional computation cost,\nwhich even outperforms most costly search-based automatic augmentation methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2020 03:43:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-22"}

In particular, our proposed\nmodel-based deep architecture is applied to the conventional phase retrieval\nproblem (via the incremental reshaped Wirtinger flow algorithm) and the sparse\nphase retrieval problem (via the sparse truncated amplitude flow algorithm),\nshowing immense promise in both cases. Furthermore, we consider a joint design\nof the sensing matrix and the signal processing algorithm and utilize the deep\nunfolding technique in the process.

A key question for this\nforecast is: how to fully utilize the historical data (e.g., retinal image) up\nto the current stage for future disease prediction? In this paper, we provide\nan answer with a novel framework, namely \\textbf{D}isease \\textbf{F}orecast via\n\\textbf{P}rogression \\textbf{L}earning (\\textbf{DFPL}), which exploits the\nirreversibility prior (i.e., cannot be reversed once diagnosed). Specifically,\nbased on this prior, we decompose two factors that contribute to the prediction\nof the future disease: i) the current disease label given the data (retinal\nimage, clinical attributes) at present and ii) the future disease label given\nthe progression of the retinal images that from the current to the future. To\nmodel these two factors, we introduce the current and progression predictors in\nDFPL, respectively. In order to account for the degree of progression of the\ndisease, we propose a temporal generative model to accurately generate the\nfuture image and compare it with the current one to get a residual image. The\ngenerative model is implemented by a recurrent neural network, in order to\nexploit the dependency of the historical data.

The critical and minimum depths of water above the inlet of\nthe drainpipe, where a surface dip starts to develop for drainpipes of various\ndiameters, were examined parametrically. This study explored the following\nnaturally occurring phenomena arising from a plughole vortex. (i) A plughole\nvortex initially causes a surface dip to develop towards the inlet of the\ndrainpipe and as the surface dip approaches the inlet of the drainpipe it\ncreates a droplet-shaped air bubble. (ii) A unique bubble transformation, i.e.,\nfrom a droplet-shaped to a donut-shaped bubble ring, occurs just after the\nseparation of the droplet-shaped air bubble from the surface dip. (iii) The\ndonut-shaped bubble ring flows with the drain water and initially causes bubbly\nflow in the drainpipe. (iv) As the water head above the inlet of the drainpipe\ndecreases, the droplet-shaped bubble size increases, and consequently, the\nbubble ring size increases and causes slug flow in the drainpipe. (v) As the\nslugs combine, the flow of the draining water eventually becomes annular flow\nin the drainpipe. Sounds, such as that of instantaneous fizz and bubble sink\ndraining, were observed to be produced as a result of the bubble formation\nprocess. Temporal changes in the shape and size of the air bubbles were\nstudied. Within the range of 0.45 to 0.6, the ratio of the bubble diameter to\nthe bubble length was found to be linearly proportional to the ratio of the\nwater depth to the diameter of the drainpipe.

First, a mathematical model is developed for the imbibition in a pore\ndoublet, which shows that the imbibition dynamics can be fully described by the\nviscosity ratio $\\lambda$ and capillary number $Ca_m$ which creatively\nincorporates the influence of channel width and length. Through the finite\ndifference solution of the mathematical model, a $\\lambda-Ca_m$ phase diagram\nis established to characterise the imbibition preference in the pore doublet.\nWe then investigate the imbibition process in a dual-permeability pore network\nusing a well-established lattice Boltzmann method, focusing on the competition\nbetween the viscous and capillary forces. Like in the pore doublet, the\npreferential imbibition occurs in high permeability zone at high $Ca_{m}$ but\nin low permeability zone at low $Ca_{m}$. When $Ca_m$ is not sufficiently high,\nan oblique advancing pattern is observed which is attributed to non-trivial\ninterfacial tension. Thanks to the newly defined capillary number, the critical\n$Ca_{m}$ curve on which the breakthrough simultaneously occurs in both\npermeability zones, is found to match perfectly with that from the pore doublet\nand it is the optimal condition for maximising the imbibition efficiency in the\nentire pore network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2020 05:35:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-01"}

A well-studied problem in such area is k-hop constrained s-t simple path\nenumeration. Nevertheless, all existing algorithms targeting this problem\nfollow the DFS-based paradigm, which cannot scale up well. Moreover, using\nhardware devices like FPGA to accelerate graph computation has become popular.\nMotivated by this, in this paper, we propose the first FPGA-based algorithm\nPEFP to solve the problem of k-hop constrained s-t simple path enumeration\nefficiently.

Traditionally, UAVs utilize\nexhaustive lawnmower exploration patterns to locate stranded survivors, without\nany information regarding the survivor's whereabouts. In real life disaster\nscenarios however, on-ground observers provide valuable information to the\nrescue effort, such as the survivor's last known location and heading.

In this\npaper, we introduce a powerful and versatile score-based framework for\nanalyzing nonstationarity in stochastic materials microstructures. The\nframework involves training a parametric supervised learning model to predict a\npixel value using neighboring pixels in images of microstructures~(as known as\nmicrographs), and this predictive model provides an implicit characterization\nof the stochastic nature of the microstructure. The basis for our approach is\nthe Fisher score vector, defined as the gradient of the log-likelihood with\nrespect to the parameters of the predictive model, at each micrograph pixel. A\nfundamental property of the score vector is that it is zero-mean if the\npredictive relationship in the vicinity of that pixel remains unchanged, which\nwe equate with the local stochastic nature of the microstructure remaining\nunchanged. Conversely, if the local stochastic nature changes, then the mean of\nthe score vector generally differs from zero. Our framework analyzes how the\nlocal mean of the score vector varies across one or more image samples to: (1)\nmonitor for nonstationarity by indicating whether new samples are statistically\ndifferent than reference samples and where they may differ and (2) diagnose\nnonstationarity by identifying the distinct types of stochastic microstructures\nand labeling accordingly the corresponding regions of the samples. Unlike\nfeature-based methods, our approach is almost completely general and requires\nno prior knowledge of the nature of the nonstationarities. Using a number of\nreal and simulated micrographs, including polymer composites and multiphase\nalloys, we demonstrate the power and versatility of the approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2020 06:24:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-22"}

HHR-GNN learns a personalized receptive field\nfor each node by leveraging knowledge graph embedding to learn relation scores\nbetween the central node's representations at different hops. In neighborhood\naggregation, our model simultaneously allows for hop-aware projection and\naggregation. This mechanism enables the central node to learn a hop-wise\nneighborhood mixing that can be applied to both homogeneous and heterogeneous\ngraphs.

However, the strong non-linearity of FWI resulting from\nfitting oscillatory waveforms can trap the optimization in local minima. We\npropose a neural-network-based full waveform inversion method (NNFWI) that\nintegrates deep neural networks with FWI by representing the velocity model\nwith a generative neural network. Neural networks can naturally introduce\nspatial correlations as regularization to the generated velocity model, which\nsuppresses noise in the gradients and mitigates local minima. The velocity\nmodel generated by neural networks is input to the same partial differential\nequation (PDE) solvers used in conventional FWI. The gradients of both the\nneural networks and PDEs are calculated using automatic differentiation, which\nback-propagates gradients through the acoustic PDEs and neural network layers\nto update the weights of the generative neural network. Experiments on 1D\nvelocity models, the Marmousi model, and the 2004 BP model demonstrate that\nNNFWI can mitigate local minima, especially for imaging high-contrast features\nlike salt bodies, and significantly improves the inversion in the presence of\nnoise. Adding dropout layers to the neural network model also allows analyzing\nthe uncertainty of the inversion results through Monte Carlo dropout. NNFWI\nopens a new pathway to combine deep learning and FWI for exploiting both the\ncharacteristics of deep neural networks and the high accuracy of PDE solvers.\nBecause NNFWI does not require extra training data and optimization loops, it\nprovides an attractive and straightforward alternative to conventional FWI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2020 07:01:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 18 Sep 2021 21:18:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 30 Sep 2021 22:14:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-04"}

A training dataset was created by manually\nsegmenting the regions of the phantom for 40 cases (20 cases each).\nSegmentation accuracy of the CNN model was assessed with the Dice coefficient\nand the average symmetric surface distance (ASD) through the 4-fold cross\nvalidation. Further, absolute differences of radiodensity values (in Hounsfield\nunits: HU) were compared between manually segmented regions and automatically\nsegmented regions.

In this thesis, we propose a new feedback for Feedback-driven Fuzz\ntesting that combines code coverage with the \"shape\" of the data. We learn\nlikely invariants for each basic block in order to divide into regions the\nspace described by the variables used in the block. The goal is to distinguish\nin the feedback when a block is executed with values that fall in different\nregions of the space. This better approximates the program state coverage and,\non some targets, improves the ability of the fuzzer in finding faults.

Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is dominant in\ntraining a DNN by adjusting neural network weights to minimize the DNNs loss\nfunction. As an alternative approach, neuroevolution is more in line with an\nevolutionary process and provides some key capabilities that are often\nunavailable in SGD, such as the heuristic black-box search strategy based on\nindividual collaboration in neuroevolution. This paper proposes a novel\napproach that combines the merits of both neuroevolution and SGD, enabling\nevolutionary search, parallel exploration, and an effective probe for optimal\nDNNs. A hierarchical cluster-based suppression algorithm is also developed to\novercome similar weight updates among individuals for improving population\ndiversity. We implement the proposed approach in four representative DNNs based\non four publicly-available datasets.

In our investigation, we find, however, that simple\ntransferable attacks which require neither additional data nor model training\ncan achieve surprisingly high targeted transferability. This insight has been\noverlooked until now, mainly due to the widespread practice of unreasonably\nrestricting attack optimization to a limited number of iterations. In\nparticular, we, for the first time, identify that a simple logit loss can yield\ncompetitive results with the state of the arts. Our analysis spans a variety of\ntransfer settings, especially including three new, realistic settings: an\nensemble transfer setting with little model similarity, a worse-case setting\nwith low-ranked target classes, and also a real-world attack against the Google\nCloud Vision API.

And then they make a comprehensive decision to\nconfirm the brain tumor based on the information obtained from multi-views.\nInspired by this diagnosing process and in order to further utilize the 3D\ninformation hidden in the dataset, this paper proposes a multi-view dynamic\nfusion framework to improve the performance of brain tumor segmentation. The\nproposed framework consists of 1) a multi-view deep neural network\narchitecture, which represents multi learning networks for segmenting the brain\ntumor from different views and each deep neural network corresponds to\nmulti-modal brain images from one single view and 2) the dynamic decision\nfusion method, which is mainly used to fuse segmentation results from\nmulti-views as an integrate one and two different fusion methods, the voting\nmethod and the weighted averaging method, have been adopted to evaluate the\nfusing process. Moreover, the multi-view fusion loss, which consists of the\nsegmentation loss, the transition loss and the decision loss, is proposed to\nfacilitate the training process of multi-view learning networks so as to keep\nthe consistency of appearance and space, not only in the process of fusing\nsegmentation results, but also in the process of training the learning network.\n\\par By evaluating the proposed framework on BRATS 2015 and BRATS 2018, it can\nbe found that the fusion results from multi-views achieve a better performance\nthan the segmentation result from the single view and the effectiveness of\nproposed multi-view fusion loss has also been proved.

The nonlinear\nconvective terms are discretized explicitly, while the remaining two subsystems\naccounting for the Alfven waves and the magneto-acoustic waves are treated\nimplicitly. The final algorithm is at least formally constrained only by a mild\nCFL stability condition depending on the velocity field of the pure\nhydrodynamic convection.

Specifically, task-specific pruning learns to adaptively\nremove the irrelevant network parameters for each task, while task-agnostic\npruning learns to find an efficient architecture by sharing the early layers of\nthe network across different tasks. Since the shared layers allow for feature\nreuse, only a single inference of the task-agnostic layers is needed to\ngenerate multiple imagery effects from the input image.

We analyze three policies in the many-passenger\nlimit by a geometric representation of the queue position and row designation\nof each passenger and apply a Lorentzian metric to calculate the total boarding\ntime. The boarding time is governed by the time each passenger needs to clear\nthe aisle, and the added time is determined by the aisle-clearing time\ndistribution through an effective aisle-clearing time parameter. The\nnon-organized queues under the common random boarding policy are characterized\nby large effective aisle-clearing time. We show that, subject to a mathematical\nassumption which we have verified by extensive numerical computations in all\nrealistic cases, the average total boarding time is always reduced when slow\npassengers are separated from faster passengers and the slow group is allowed\nto enter the airplane first. This is a universal result that holds for any\ncombination of the three main governing parameters: the ratio between effective\naisle-clearing times of the fast and the slow group, the fraction of slow\npassenger, and the congestion of passengers in the aisle. Separation into\ngroups based on aisle-clearing time allows for more synchronized seating, but\nthe result is non-trivial, as the similar fast-first policy -- where the two\ngroups enter the airplane in reverse order -- is inferior to random boarding\nfor a range of parameter settings.

In realistic\napplications, the efficiencies of these methods are always degraded by many\nlimiting factors, a quite important one being the shot noise induced by the\nfinite number density of biased matter tracers (i.e., luminous galaxies or dark\nmatter halos) in observations. In this work, we explore the gains of biased\ntracer reconstruction achieved from halo mass information, which can suppress\nshot noise component and dramatically improves the cross-correlation between\ntracer field and dark matter. To this end, we first closely study the\nclustering biases and the stochasticity properties of halo fields with various\nnumber densities under different weighting schemes, i.e., the uniform, mass and\noptimal weightings. Then, we apply the biased tracer reconstruction method to\nthese different weighted halo fields and investigate how linear bias and\nobservational mass scatter affect the reconstruction performance.

The proposed method is based on the\nminimization of an objective function mixing a fidelity term, a context\ncriterion and a regularizer. The solution of this objective function defines\nthe architecture of a bi-level hierarchical context network; the first level of\nthis network captures scene geometry while the second one corresponds to\nsemantic relationships.

In the quantum-mechanical framework of time-dependent\ndensity-functional theory, we investigate from first principles the impact of\nprotonation of triazine and amino groups in molecular building blocks of COFs\nin water solution. In all considered cases, we find that proton uptake leads to\na gap reduction and to a reorganization of the electronic structure, driven by\nthe presence of the proton and by the electrostatic attraction between the\npositively charged protonated species and the negative counterion in its\nvicinity. Structural distortions induced by protonation are found to play only\na minor role. The interplay between band-gap renormalization and exciton\nbinding strength determines the energy of the absorption onsets: when the\nformer prevails on the latter, a red-shift is observed. Furthermore, the\nspatial and energetic rearrangement of the molecular orbitals upon protonation\ninduces a splitting of the lowest-energy peaks and a decrease of their\noscillator strength in comparison with the pristine counterparts. Our results\noffer quantitative and microscopic insight into the role of protonation on the\nelectronic and optical properties of triazine derivatives as building blocks of\nCOFs.

Traps are characterized by the height of their\nassociated barrier for thermal detrapping, and a continuous distribution of\ntrap depths is often found in real materials. Accurately determining trap depth\ndistributions is hence of importance for the understanding and development of\npersistent phosphors. However, extracting the trap depth distribution is often\nhindered by the presence of a thermal barrier for charging as well, which\ncauses a temperature-dependent filling of traps. For this case, we propose a\nmethod for extracting the trap depth distribution from a set of\nthermoluminescence (TL) curves obtained at different charging temperatures. The\nTL curves are first transformed into electron population functions via the\nTikhonov regularization, assuming first-order kinetics. Subsequently, the\noccupation of the traps as a function of their depth, quantified by the\nso-called filling function, is obtained. Finally, the underlying trap depth\ndistribution is reconstructed from the filling functions. The proposed method\nprovides a substantial improvement in precision and resolution for the trap\ndepth distribution compared with existing methods. This is hence a step forward\nin understanding the (de)trapping behavior of persistent and storage phosphors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2020 13:01:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 13 Nov 2021 21:47:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 2 Jun 2022 12:07:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-03"}

These are general\nsolutions that, given a sufficiently fine-grained discretization of space and\ntime, can achieve highly realistic results. However, they are computationally\nexpensive and any scene modification prompts the need of re-simulation. Linear\nBlend Skinning (LBS) with PSD offers a lightweight alternative to PBS, though,\nit needs huge volumes of data to learn proper PSD. We propose using deep\nlearning, formulated as an implicit PBS, to unsupervisedly learn realistic\ncloth Pose Space Deformations in a constrained scenario: dressed humans.\nFurthermore, we show it is possible to train these models in an amount of time\ncomparable to a PBS of a few sequences. To the best of our knowledge, we are\nthe first to propose a neural simulator for cloth. While deep-based approaches\nin the domain are becoming a trend, these are data-hungry models. Moreover,\nauthors often propose complex formulations to better learn wrinkles from PBS\ndata. Supervised learning leads to physically inconsistent predictions that\nrequire collision solving to be used. Also, dependency on PBS data limits the\nscalability of these solutions, while their formulation hinders its\napplicability and compatibility. By proposing an unsupervised methodology to\nlearn PSD for LBS models (3D animation standard), we overcome both of these\ndrawbacks. Results obtained show cloth-consistency in the animated garments and\nmeaningful pose-dependant folds and wrinkles. Our solution is extremely\nefficient, handles multiple layers of cloth, allows unsupervised outfit\nresizing and can be easily applied to any custom 3D avatar.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2020 13:22:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 10:35:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 21 May 2021 18:41:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-25"}

Despite the vital importance of this result, its validity and\nperformance in practice has not been investigated yet. In this paper, we\nperformed Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes simulations of subsonic, transonic,\nand supersonic flows over a three-dimensional wing. The aerodynamic forces\nobtained from the universal force theory are compared with that from the\nstandard wall-stress integrals. The agreement between these two formulas\nconfirms for the first time the validity of the theory in three-dimensional\nsteady viscous and compressible flow. The good performance of the universal\nformula is mainly due to the fact that the turbulent viscosity in the wake is\nmuch larger than the molecular viscosity therein, which can reduce\nsignificantly the distance of the steady linear far field from the body. To\nfurther confirm the correctness of the theory, comparisons are made for the\nflow structures on the wake plane obtained from the analytical results and\nnumerical simulations. The underlying physics relevant to the universality of\nthe theory is explained by identifying different sources of vorticity in the\nwake.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2020 13:31:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-11"}

The interacting nature of the pores within a porous medium can\nbe well depicted by an interacting capillary model. However, the arrangement of\npores is crucial in understanding the flow behaviour in an interacting\ncapillary system, which also leads to different governing equations of\nspontaneous imbibition. To this end, in the present work, we first develop a\ngeneralized one-dimensional lubrication approximation model to predict the\nimbibition behaviour in an interacting multi-capillary system. Using our\ngeneralized model, we observe that the flow dynamics, the capillary having the\nleading meniscus and the breakthrough time are governed by the contrast in the\nradii and the arrangement of the capillaries. We also show that during\nbreakthrough, the saturation of the multi-capillary system depends on the\narrangement of the capillaries. We show that the breakthrough in the\nbundle-of-tubes model occurs at a dimensionless time of $0.5$, while the\nbreakthrough in the interacting capillary system occurs between the\ndimensionless times $0.31$ and $0.42$, for the capillary system considered in\nthis study.

Yet vanilla Transformers are notoriously resource-expensive,\nrequiring $O(L^2)$ in serial time and memory as functions of input length $L$.\nRecent works proposed various linear self-attention mechanisms, scaling only as\n$O(L)$ for serial computation. We perform a thorough analysis of recent\nTransformer mechanisms with linear self-attention, Performers, in terms of\noverall computational complexity. We observe a remarkable computational\nflexibility: forward and backward propagation can be performed with no\napproximations using sublinear memory as a function of $L$ (in addition to\nnegligible storage for the input sequence), at a cost of greater time\ncomplexity in the parallel setting. In the extreme case, a Performer consumes\nonly $O(1)$ memory during training, and still requires $O(L)$ time. This\ndiscovered time-memory tradeoff can be used for training or, due to complete\nbackward-compatibility, for fine-tuning on a low-memory device, e.g. a\nsmartphone or an earlier-generation GPU, thus contributing towards\ndecentralized and democratized deep learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2020 13:56:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-22"}

This paper studies a\nclass of non-cooperative games, known as N-cluster game, which subsumes both\ncooperative and non-cooperative nature among multiple agents in the two\nproblems: solving distributed optimization problem within the cluster, while\nplaying a non-cooperative game across the clusters. Moreover, we consider a\npartial-decision information game setup, i.e., the agents do not have direct\naccess to other agents' decisions, and hence need to communicate with each\nother through a directed graph. To solve the N-cluster game problem, we propose\na distributed NE seeking algorithm by a synthesis of consensus and gradient\ntracking. Unlike other existing discrete-time methods for N-cluster games where\neither a common step-size is publicly known by all agents or only known by\nagents from the same cluster, the proposed algorithm can work with fully\nuncoordinated constant step-sizes, which allows the agents (both within and\nacross the clusters) to choose their own preferred step-sizes. We prove that\nall agents' decisions converge linearly to their corresponding NE so long as\nthe largest step-size and the heterogeneity of the step-sizes are small. We\nverify the derived results through a numerical example in a Cournot competition\ngame.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2020 13:58:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Jun 2021 02:29:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 28 Feb 2023 06:13:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-01"}

To this end, we propose a visualization tool called AC2, which allows\nits users to examine the alterations in the architecture at both higher and\nlower levels of abstraction for the python projects. AC2 uses call graphs and\ncollaboration graphs to show the interaction between different architectural\ncomponents. The tool provides four different views to see the architectural\nchanges.

For\naggregated data under stationary conditions, flow and density are related by\nthe fundamental diagram. However, high resolution data obtained from modern\nsensor networks is generally non-stationary and disaggregated. Such data\nconsequently show significant statistical fluctuations. These fluctuations are\nbest described using a bivariate probability distribution in the density-flow\nplane. By applying kernel density estimation to high-volume data from the UK\nNational Traffic Information Service (NTIS), we empirically construct these\ndistributions for London's M25 motorway. Curves in the density-flow plane are\nthen constructed, analogous to quantiles of univariate distributions. These\ncurves quantitatively separate atypical fluctuations from typical traffic\nstates. Although the algorithm identifies anomalies in general rather than\nspecific events, we find that fluctuations outside the 95\\% probability curve\ncorrelate strongly with the spikes in travel time associated with significant\ncongestion events. Moreover, the size of an excursion from the typical region\nprovides a simple, real-time measure of the severity of detected anomalies. We\nvalidate the algorithm by benchmarking its ability to identify labelled events\nin historical NTIS data against some commonly used methods from the literature.\nDetection rate, time-to-detect and false alarm rate are used as metrics and\nfound to be generally comparable except in situations when the speed\ndistribution is bi-modal. In such situations, the new algorithm achieves a much\nlower false alarm rate without suffering significant degradation on the other\nmetrics.

QSO B1420+326 is a blazar classified as a Flat Spectrum Radio Quasar\n(FSRQ). In the beginning of 2020 it underwent an enhanced flux state. An\nextensive multiwavelength campaign allowed us to trace the evolution of the\nflare. Aims. We search for VHE gamma-ray emission from QSO B1420+326 during\nthis flaring state. We aim to characterize and model the broadband emission of\nthe source over different phases of the flare. Methods. The source was observed\nwith a number of instruments in radio, near infrared, optical (including\npolarimetry and spectroscopy), ultra-violet, X-ray and gamma-ray bands. We use\ndedicated optical spectroscopy results to estimate the accretion disk and the\ndust torus luminosity. We perform spectral energy distribution modeling in the\nframework of combined Synchrotron-Self-Compton and External Compton scenario in\nwhich the electron energy distribution is partially determined from\nacceleration and cooling processes. Results. During the enhanced state the flux\nof both SED components drastically increased and the peaks were shifted to\nhigher energies. Follow up observations with the MAGIC telescopes led to the\ndetection of very-high-energy gamma-ray emission from this source, making it\none of only a handful of FSRQs known in this energy range. Modeling allows us\nto constrain the evolution of the magnetic field and electron energy\ndistribution in the emission region. The gamma-ray flare was accompanied by a\nrotation of the optical polarization vector during a low polarization state.\nAlso, a new, superluminal radio knot contemporaneously appeared in the radio\nimage of the jet. The optical spectroscopy shows a prominent FeII bump with\nflux evolving together with the continuum emission and a MgII line with varying\nequivalent width.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2020 14:26:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-05"}

This is because, each ($J/\\Psi,\\Upsilon$) and\n($\\eta_c,\\eta_b$) meson group is usually assumed to have very similar\nproperties based on the heavy charm and bottom quark masses. The estimate for\nthe $\\Upsilon$ is made using an SU(5) effective Lagrangian and the anomalous\ncoupling one, by studying the $BB$, $BB^*$, and $B^*B^*$ meson loop\ncontributions for the self-energy. As for the $\\eta_b$, we include the $BB^*$\nand $B^*B^*$ meson loop contributions in the self-energy. The in-medium masses\nof the $B$ and $B^*$ mesons appearing in the self-energy are calculated by the\nquark-meson coupling model. An analysis on the $BB$, $BB^*$, and $B^*B^*$ meson\nloops in the $\\Upsilon$ mass shift is made by comparing with the corresponding\n$DD, DD^*$, and $D^*D^*$ meson loops for the $J/\\Psi$ mass shift. Our\nprediction for the $\\eta_b$ mass shift is made including only the lowest order\n$BB^*$ meson loop. The $\\Upsilon$ mass shift, with including only the $BB$\nloop, is predicted to be -16 to -22 MeV at the nuclear matter saturation\ndensity using the $\\Upsilon BB$ coupling constant determined by the vector\nmeson dominance model with the experimental data, while the $\\eta_b$ mass shift\nis predicted to be -75 to -82 MeV with the SU(5) universal coupling constant\ndetermined by the $\\Upsilon BB$ coupling constant.

Thus, those entity\npairs without relationships disperse the attention of the encoder-classifier\nDocRE for ones with relationships, which may further hind the improvement of\nDocRE. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel\nencoder-classifier-reconstructor model for DocRE. The reconstructor manages to\nreconstruct the ground-truth path dependencies from the graph representation,\nto ensure that the proposed DocRE model pays more attention to encode entity\npairs with relationships in the training. Furthermore, the reconstructor is\nregarded as a relationship indicator to assist relation classification in the\ninference, which can further improve the performance of DocRE model.\nExperimental results on a large-scale DocRE dataset show that the proposed\nmodel can significantly improve the accuracy of relation extraction on a strong\nheterogeneous graph-based baseline.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2020 14:29:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-22"}

Most existing HOP definitions\nare based on either homophily to place close and highly interconnected nodes\ntightly in embedding space or heterophily to place distant but structurally\nsimilar nodes together after embedding. In real-world networks, both can\nco-exist, and thus considering only one could limit the prediction performance\nand interpretability. However, there is no general and universal solution that\ntakes both into consideration. In this paper, we propose such a simple yet\npowerful framework called homophily and heterophliy preserving network\ntransformation (H2NT) to capture HOP that flexibly unifies homophily and\nheterophily. Specifically, H2NT utilises motif representations to transform a\nnetwork into a new network with a hybrid assumption via micro-level and\nmacro-level walk paths. H2NT can be used as an enhancer to be integrated with\nany existing network embedding methods without requiring any changes to latter\nmethods. Because H2NT can sparsify networks with motif structures, it can also\nimprove the computational efficiency of existing network embedding methods when\nintegrated. We conduct experiments on node classification, structural role\nclassification and motif prediction to show the superior prediction performance\nand computational efficiency over state-of-the-art methods.

While it is still unclear how to overcome these\nlimitations, one can observe a paradigm shift within the machine learning\ncommunity, with research interests shifting away from increasing the\nperformance of highly parameterized models to exceedingly specific tasks, and\ntowards employing machine learning algorithms in highly diverse domains. This\nresearch question can be approached from different angles. For instance, the\nfield of Informed AI investigates the problem of infusing domain knowledge into\na machine learning model, by using techniques such as regularization, data\naugmentation or post-processing.\n  On the other hand, a remarkable number of works in the recent years has\nfocused on developing models that by themselves guarantee a certain degree of\nversatility and invariance with respect to the domain or problem at hand. Thus,\nrather than investigating how to provide domain-specific knowledge to machine\nlearning models, these works explore methods that equip the models with the\ncapability of acquiring the knowledge by themselves. This white paper provides\nan introduction and discussion of this emerging field in machine learning\nresearch. To this end, it reviews the role of knowledge in machine learning,\nand discusses its relation to the concept of invariance, before providing a\nliterature review of the field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2020 15:07:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-22"}

Security of CNNs in robotics\napplications is an important issue, for which potential adversarial attacks on\nCNNs are worth research. Pooling is a typical step of dimension reduction and\ninformation discarding in CNNs. Such information discarding may result in\nmis-deletion and mis-preservation of data features which largely influence the\noutput of the network. This may aggravate the vulnerability of CNNs to\nadversarial attacks. In this paper, we conduct adversarial attacks on CNNs from\nthe perspective of network structure by investigating and exploiting the\nvulnerability of pooling. First, a novel adversarial attack methodology named\nStrict Layer-Output Manipulation (SLOM) is proposed. Then an attack method\nbased on Strict Pooling Manipulation (SPM) which is an instantiation of the\nSLOM spirit is designed to effectively realize both type I and type II\nadversarial attacks on a target CNN. Performances of attacks based on SPM at\ndifferent depths are also investigated and compared. Moreover, performances of\nattack methods designed by instantiating the SLOM spirit with different\noperation layers of CNNs are compared. Experiment results reflect that pooling\ntends to be more vulnerable to adversarial attacks than other operations in\nCNNs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2020 15:18:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-22"}

In this study, we investigate how the instellation and\nplanetary parameters influence the atmospheric climate, chemistry, and spectral\nappearance of LHS 1140 b. We study the detectability of selected molecules, in\nparticular potential biosignatures, with the upcoming James Webb Space\nTelescope (JWST) and Extremely Large Telescope (ELT). In a first step we use\nthe coupled climate-chemistry model, 1D-TERRA, to simulate a range of assumed\natmospheric chemical compositions dominated by H$_2$ and CO$_2$. Further, we\nvary the concentrations of CH$_4$ by several orders of magnitude. In a second\nstep we calculate transmission spectra of the simulated atmospheres and compare\nthem to recent transit observations. Finally, we determine the observation time\nrequired to detect spectral bands with low resolution spectroscopy using JWST\nand the cross-correlation technique using ELT. In H$_2$-dominated and\nCH$_4$-rich atmospheres O$_2$ has strong chemical sinks, leading to low\nconcentrations of O$_2$ and O$_3$. The potential biosignatures NH$_3$, PH$_3$,\nCH$_3$Cl and N$_2$O are less sensitive to the concentration of H$_2$, CO$_2$\nand CH$_4$ in the atmosphere. In the simulated H$_2$-dominated atmosphere the\ndetection of these gases might be feasible within 20 to 100 observation hours\nwith ELT or JWST, when assuming weak extinction by hazes.

To overcome this limitation, a possible solution consists in\netching on a grounded substrate two concentric radiating elements and combining\ntwo modes (one for each element) with proper amplitude/phase relations.\nAlthough this technique leads, in principle, to an infinite number of possible\nconfigurations (i.e., each patch element can support an infinite number of\nmodes), the theoretical and experimental verifications available in the\nliterature are limited to the first two radiating modes (TM 11 and TM 21 ) of a\ncircular patch antenna. Recently, we have shown that the design of this\ncircular patch can be effectively performed by exploiting the topological\nproperties of vortex fields and, in particular, by controlling the phase\nsingularity exhibited by the higher order right-handed circularly polarized\n(RHCP) TM 21 mode of the circular patch. Since the number of RHCP higher order\nmodes of a circular patch is infinite, we can in principle deal with an\narbitrary number of phase singularity points, whose combined control leads to\nunprecedented possibilities to shape the radiation pattern of a circular patch.\nIn this article, we present a complete design tool to determine the number and\nposition of phase singularity points arising when combining the RHCP modes of a\ncircular patch antenna and, eventually, manipulate them to synthesize the\nrequired radiation pattern. As a realistic application example, we show how the\nproposed tool can be used to effectively design a single antenna whose\nradiation pattern can be properly tailored to switch between two different\nstates, i.e., a sector and a saddle shape, widely used in base stations for\nmobile and satellite communications, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2020 12:55:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-25"}

This\nimplies that our model predicts +/- 1140 cases than the original in a\npopulation of 1 million. In addition, we forecast the location-wise percentage\nof the population testing positive for the next 30 days using self-reported\nsymptoms data from previous days. The MAE for this method is as low as 0.15\n(MRE of 23.61\\% with 95\\% confidence interval as (23.6, 13.7)) for New York. We\npresent an analysis of these results, exposing various clinical attributes of\ninterest across different demographics. Lastly, we qualitatively analyze how\nvarious policy enactments (testing, curfew) affect the prevalence of COVID-19\nin a community.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2020 00:37:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 19 Jun 2021 17:07:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-22"}

Customer satisfaction with airlines and airport performance is\nconsiderably influenced by how much flights are delayed. But how should the\ndelay be quantified with thousands of flights for each airport and airline?\nHere, we present a statistical analysis of arrival delays at several UK\nairports between 2018 and 2020. We establish a procedure to compare both mean\ndelay and extreme events among airlines and airports, identifying a power-law\ndecay of large delays. Furthermore, we note drastic changes in plane delay\nstatistics during the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, we find that delays are\ndescribed by a superposition of simple distributions, leading to a\nsuperstatistics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2020 10:04:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Mar 2021 17:48:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 31 Mar 2021 09:36:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-01"}

The epistemological process is understood as\nthe process of subjective extraction of some knowledge from the incoming\ninformation. The concepts of nonsense are introduced as a meaning that has a\nminimum value equal to one and the level of intelligence as a geometric mean of\nthe cumulative meaning. The thesis of the multiplicativity of meaning, its\npolymorphism is substantiated, and numerous examples from world history are\nprovided. By analogy with classical thermodynamics, three laws of\nthermodynamics of meaning are postulated. Estimates of the cumulative meaning\nwhen the comprehension of information (multiplicative cascade) is a random\nprocess with given statistical characteristics are carried out.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2020 07:49:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-23"}
