Apparently, the strong notion of envy-freeness, where no\nagent envies another for their resource or mates, cannot always be achieved and\nwe show that even to decide the existence of such a strongly envy-free\nassignment is an intractable problem. Thus, a more interesting question is\nwhether (and in what situations) a relaxed notion of envy-freeness, the Pareto\nenvy-freeness, can be achieved: an agent i envies another agent j only when i\nenvies both the resource and the mates of j. In particular, we are interested\nin a dorm assignment problem, where students are to be assigned to dorms with\nthe same capacity and they have dichotomous preference over their dorm-mates.\nWe show that when the capacity of the dorms is 2, a Pareto envy-free assignment\nalways exists and we present a polynomial-time algorithm to compute such an\nassignment; nevertheless, the result fails to hold immediately when the\ncapacities increase to 3, in which case even Pareto envy-freeness cannot be\nguaranteed.

Based on these measurements, imaging is usually\nperformed using the Synthetic Aperture Focusing Technique (SAFT). However, SAFT\nis sub-optimal in terms of resolution and requires oversampling in time domain\nto obtain a fine grid for the Delay-and-Sum (DAS). On the other hand,\nparametric reconstruction algorithms give better resolution, but their usage\nfor imaging becomes computationally expensive due to the size of the parameter\nspace and the large amount of measurement data in realistic 3-D scenarios. In\nthe literature, the remedies to this are twofold: First, the amount of\nmeasurement data can be reduced using state of the art sub-Nyquist sampling\napproaches to measure Fourier coefficients instead of time domain samples.\nSecond, parametric reconstruction algorithms mostly rely on matrix-vector\noperations that can be implemented efficiently by exploiting the underlying\nmodel structure. In this paper, we propose and compare different strategies to\nchoose the Fourier coefficients to be measured. Their asymptotic performance is\ncompared by numerically evaluating the Cram\\'er-Rao-Bound for the\nlocalizability of the defect coordinates. These subsampling strategies are then\ncombined with an $\\ell_1$-minimization scheme to compute 3-D reconstructions\nfrom the low-rate measurements. Compared to conventional DAS, this allows us to\nformulate a fully physically motivated forward model. To enable this, the\nprojection operations of the forward model matrix are implemented matrix-free\nby exploiting the underlying 2-level Toeplitz structure. Finally, we show that\nhigh resolution reconstructions from as low as a single Fourier coefficient per\nscan are possible based on simulated data as well as on measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2020 16:22:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-09"}

This linear inverse\nproblem is extremely under-determined since the measurements are far fewer than\nthe number of unknowns. Moreover, it is more challenging than conventional\ntomography where a sufficiently large number of projection angles forms the\nmeasurements, allowing for a simple inversion process. However, single-shot\ntomography becomes less severe if the target image is only composed of known\nshapes. Hence, the shape prior transforms a linear ill-posed image estimation\nproblem to a non-linear problem of estimating the roto-translations of the\nshapes.

Existing graph mining techniques including both\ncustom graph mining applications and general-purpose graph mining systems,\ndevelop efficient execution plans to speed up the exploration of the given\nquery patterns that represent subgraph structures of interest.\n  In this paper, we step beyond the traditional philosophy of optimizing the\nexecution plans for a given set of patterns, and exploit the sub-structural\nsimilarities across different query patterns. We propose Pattern Morphing, a\ntechnique that enables structure-aware algebra over patterns to accurately\ninfer the results for a given set of patterns using the results of a completely\ndifferent set of patterns that are less expensive to compute. Pattern morphing\n\"morphs\" (or converts) a given set of query patterns into alternative patterns,\nwhile retaining full equivalency. It is a general technique that supports\nvarious operations over matches of a pattern beyond just counting (e.g.,\nsupport calculation, enumeration, etc.), making it widely applicable to various\ngraph mining applications like Motif Counting and Frequent Subgraph Mining.\nSince pattern morphing mainly transforms query patterns before their\nexploration starts, it can be easily incorporated in existing general-purpose\ngraph mining systems. We evaluate the effectiveness of pattern morphing by\nincorporating it in Peregrine, a recent state-of-the-art graph mining system,\nand show that pattern morphing significantly improves the performance of\ndifferent graph mining applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2020 16:46:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-09"}

Firstly, these\nmethods suffer from the class-imbalanced problem where rating levels with lower\nproportions will be ignored to some extent. Thus, their performance on\nrelatively rare rating levels is unsatisfactory. As the first attempt in this\nfield to address this problem, we propose a flexible dual-optimizer model to\ngain robustness from both regression loss and classification loss. Secondly, to\naddress the problem caused by the insufficient contextual information\nextraction ability of word embedding, we first introduce BERT into the\nreview-based method to improve the performance of the semantic analysis.\nThirdly, the existing methods ignore the feature information of the\ntime-varying user preferences. Therefore, we propose a time-varying feature\nextraction module with bidirectional long short-term memory and multi-scale\nconvolutional neural network.

We prove\nthat all graphs of maximum degree $\\Delta$ have local boxicity $O(\\Delta)$,\nwhile almost all graphs of maximum degree $\\Delta$ have local boxicity\n$\\Omega(\\Delta)$, improving known upper and lower bounds. We also give improved\nbounds on the local boxicity as a function of the number of edges or the genus.\nFinally, we investigate local boxicity through the lens of chromatic graph\ntheory. We prove that the family of graphs of local boxicity at most 2 is\n$\\chi$-bounded, which means that the chromatic number of the graphs in this\nclass can be bounded by a function of their clique number. This extends a\nclassical result on graphs of boxicity at most 2.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2020 17:14:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Dec 2020 15:59:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 19 Nov 2021 08:22:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-01"}

The data modeling culture (DMC) refers to practices aiming to conduct\nstatistical inference on one or several quantities of interest. The algorithmic\nmodeling culture (AMC) refers to practices defining a machine-learning (ML)\nprocedure that generates accurate predictions about an event of interest.\nBreiman argued that statisticians should give more attention to AMC than to\nDMC, because of the strengths of ML in adapting to data. While twenty years\nlater, DMC has lost some of its dominant role in statistics because of the\ndata-science revolution, we observe that this culture is still the leading\npractice in the natural and social sciences. DMC is the modus operandi because\nof the influence of the established scientific method, called the\nhypothetico-deductive scientific method. Despite the incompatibilities of AMC\nwith this scientific method, among some research groups, AMC and DMC cultures\nmix intensely. We argue that this mixing has formed a fertile spawning pool for\na mutated culture that we called the hybrid modeling culture (HMC) where\nprediction and inference have fused into new procedures where they reinforce\none another. This article identifies key characteristics of HMC, thereby\nfacilitating the scientific endeavor and fueling the evolution of statistical\ncultures towards better practices. By better, we mean increasingly reliable,\nvalid, and efficient statistical practices in analyzing causal relationships.\nIn combining inference and prediction, the result of HMC is that the\ndistinction between prediction and inference, taken to its limit, melts away.\nWe qualify our melting-away argument by describing three HMC practices, where\neach practice captures an aspect of the scientific cycle, namely, ML for causal\ninference, ML for data acquisition, and ML for theory prediction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2020 17:15:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-09"}

This\nhas not been successful, however, and current state of the process is the\nneoclassical framework that bases on static optimization. By using a static\nframework, however, we cannot model and forecast the time paths of economic\nquantities because for a growing firm or a firm going into bankruptcy, a\npositive profit maximizing flow of production does not exist. Due to these\nproblems, we present a dynamic theory for the production of a profit-seeking\nfirm where the adjustment may be stable or unstable. This is important,\ncurrently, because we should be able to forecast the possible future\nbankruptcies of firms due to the Covid-19 pandemic. By using the model, we can\nsolve the time moment of bankruptcy of a firm as a function of several\nparameters. The proposed model is mathematically identical with Newtonian model\nof a particle moving in a resisting medium, and so the model explains the\nreasons that stop the motion too. The frameworks for modeling dynamic events in\nphysics are thus applicable in economics, and we give reasons why physics is\nmore important for the development of economics than pure mathematics.

These methods learn to predict the\nenvironment dynamics and expected reward from interaction and use this\npredictive model to plan and perform the task. However, MBRL methods vary in\ntheir fundamental design choices, and there is no strong consensus in the\nliterature on how these design decisions affect performance. In this paper, we\nstudy a number of design decisions for the predictive model in visual MBRL\nalgorithms, focusing specifically on methods that use a predictive model for\nplanning. We find that a range of design decisions that are often considered\ncrucial, such as the use of latent spaces, have little effect on task\nperformance. A big exception to this finding is that predicting future\nobservations (i.e., images) leads to significant task performance improvement\ncompared to only predicting rewards.

We show how this\nphenomenon is related to exploration and how some of the lower-scoring models\non standard benchmarks (that require exploration) will perform the same as the\nbest-performing models when trained on the same training data. Simultaneously,\nin the absence of exploration, models that fit the data better usually perform\nbetter on the downstream task as well, but surprisingly, these are often not\nthe same models that perform the best when learning and exploring from scratch.\nThese findings suggest that performance and exploration place important and\npotentially contradictory requirements on the model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2020 18:03:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-09"}

Named Data Networking (NDN) is one of the most recent and active ICN\narchitectures that provides a clean slate approach for Internet communication.\nNDN provides intrinsic content security where security is directly provided to\nthe content instead of communication channel. Among other security aspects,\nAccess Control (AC) rules specify the privileges for the entities that can\naccess the content. In TCP/IP-based AC systems, due to the client-server\ncommunication model, the servers control which client can access a particular\ncontent. In contrast, ICN-based networks use content names to drive\ncommunication and decouple the content from its original location. This\nphenomenon leads to the loss of control over the content causing different\nchallenges for the realization of efficient AC mechanisms. To date,\nconsiderable efforts have been made to develop various AC mechanisms in NDN. In\nthis paper, we provide a detailed and comprehensive survey of the AC mechanisms\nin NDN.

Finally, we present\nthe lessons learned from the existing AC mechanisms and identify the challenges\nof NDN-based AC at large, highlighting future research directions for the\ncommunity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2020 18:47:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-09"}

Here, we introduce and study HOD response\nfunctions $R_\\mathcal{O}^g$ that describe the response of the HODs to\nlong-wavelength perturbations $\\mathcal{O}$. The linear galaxy bias parameters\n$b_\\mathcal{O}^g$ are a weighted version of $b_\\mathcal{O}^h +\nR_\\mathcal{O}^g$, where $b_\\mathcal{O}^h$ is the halo bias, but the\ncontribution from $R_\\mathcal{O}^g$ is routinely ignored in the literature. We\ninvestigate the impact of this by measuring the $R_\\mathcal{O}^g$ in separate\nuniverse simulations of the IllustrisTNG model for three types of\nperturbations: total matter perturbations, $\\mathcal{O}=\\delta_m$; baryon-CDM\ncompensated isocurvature perturbations, $\\mathcal{O}=\\sigma$; and potential\nperturbations with local primordial non-Gaussianity, $\\mathcal{O}\\propto f_{\\rm\nNL}\\phi$. Our main takeaway message is that the $R_\\mathcal{O}^g$ are not\nnegligible in general and their size should be estimated on a case-by-case\nbasis. For stellar-mass selected galaxies, the responses $R_\\phi^g$ and\n$R_\\sigma^g$ are sizeable and cannot be neglected in HM calculations of the\nbias parameters $b_\\phi^g$ and $b_\\sigma^g$; this is relevant to constrain\ninflation using galaxies. On the other hand, we do not detect a strong impact\nof the HOD response $R_1^g$ on the linear galaxy bias $b_1^g$. These results\ncan be explained by the impact that the perturbations have on\nstellar-to-total-mass relations. We also look into the impact on the bias of\nthe gas distribution and find similar conclusions. We show that a single extra\nparameter describing the overall amplitude of $R_\\mathcal{O}^g$ recovers the\nmeasured $b_\\mathcal{O}^g$ well, which indicates that $R_\\mathcal{O}^g$ can be\neasily added to HM/HOD studies as a new ingredient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2020 18:55:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2020 02:05:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 8 May 2021 19:39:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-15"}

During simultaneous optical and radio monitoring of the nearby\ndM5.5e star Proxima Centauri, we detected a bright, long-duration optical\nflare, accompanied by a series of intense, coherent radio bursts. These\ndetections include the first example of an interferometrically detected\ncoherent stellar radio burst temporally coincident with a flare, strongly\nindicating a causal relationship between these transient events. The\npolarization and temporal structure of the trailing long-duration burst enable\nus to identify it as a type IV burst. This represents the most compelling\ndetection of a solar-like radio burst from another star to date. Solar type IV\nbursts are strongly associated with space weather events such as coronal mass\nejections and solar energetic particle events, suggesting that stellar type IV\nbursts may be used as a tracer of stellar coronal mass ejections. We discuss\nthe implications of this event for the occurrence of coronal mass ejections\nfrom Proxima Cen and other active M-dwarfs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2020 18:58:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-09"}

We point out that, in this model,\nthe rates at which mass and energy need to be added to the disc are implausibly\nlarge. What is required is that the disc has not only a source of mass but also\na continuing source of angular momentum. We argue that the disc evolution may\nbe more physically modelled by application of the non-zero torque inner\nboundary condition of Nixon & Pringle (2020), which determines the torque\napplied at the boundary as a fraction of the advected angular momentum flux\nthere and approaches the accretion and decretion disc cases in the appropriate\nlimits.

In this study we\nexplore the structure and dynamics of inner bars by deriving maps and radial\nprofiles of their mean stellar population content and comparing them to\nprevious findings in the context of main bars. To this end, we exploit\nobservations obtained with the integral-field spectrograph MUSE of three\ndouble-barred galaxies in the TIMER sample. The results indicate that inner\nbars can be distinguished based on their stellar population properties alone.\nMore precisely, inner bars show elevated metallicities and depleted\n[$\\alpha$/Fe] abundances. Although they exhibit slightly younger stellar ages\ncompared to the nuclear disc, the typical age differences are small, except at\ntheir outer ends. These ends of the inner bars are clearly younger compared to\ntheir inner parts, an effect known from main bars as orbital age separation. In\nparticular, the youngest stars (i.e. those with the lowest radial velocity\ndispersion) seem to occupy the most elongated orbits along the (inner) bar\nmajor axis. We speculate that these distinct ends of bars could be connected to\nthe morphological feature of ansae. Radial profiles of metallicity and\n[$\\alpha$/Fe] enhancements are flat along the inner bar major axis, but show\nsignificantly steeper slopes along the minor axis. This radial mixing in the\ninner bar is also known from main bars and indicates that inner bars\nsignificantly affect the radial distribution of stars. In summary, based on\nmaps and radial profiles of the mean stellar population content and in line\nwith previous TIMER results, inner bars appear to be scaled down versions of\nthe main bars seen in galaxies.

The physics of the inner crust is largely dependent on that of its\n$S$-wave neutron superfluid which has made its presence known through pulsar\nglitches and modifications on the neutron star cooling. Moreover, with recent\ngravitational-wave observations of neutron star mergers, the need for an\nequation of state for the matter of these compact stars is further accentuated\nand a model-independent treatment of neutron superfluidity is important.\n\\textit{Ab initio} techniques developed for finite systems can be guided to\nperform extrapolations to the thermodynamic limit and attain this\nmodel-independent extraction of various quantities of infinite superfluid\nneutron matter. To inform such an extrapolation scheme, we performed\ncalculations of the neutron $^1S_0$ pairing gap using the model-independent\nodd-even staggering in the context of the particle-conserving, projected BCS\ntheory under twisted boundary conditions.

The\nseveral orders of magnitude increase in the number of strong galaxy-galaxy lens\nsystems is an insurmountable challenge for traditional modelling techniques.\nWhilst machine learning techniques have dramatically improved the efficiency of\nlens modelling, parametric modelling of the lens mass profile remains an\nimportant tool for dealing with complex lensing systems.

This has given rise to the question of whether these\nsubstructures are triggered by planet-disc interactions. Besides direct\nimaging, one of the most promising methods to distinguish between different\ndisc shaping mechanisms is to study the kinematics of the gas disc. In\nparticular, the deviations of the rotation profile from Keplerian velocity can\nbe used to probe perturbations in the gas pressure profile that may be caused\nby embedded planets. In this paper we aim to analyze the gas brightness\ntemperature and kinematics of the transitional disc around the CQ Tau star in\norder to resolve and characterize substructure in the gas, caused by possible\nperturbers. For our analysis we use spatially resolved ALMA observations of\n12CO, 13CO and C18O (J=2-1). We further extract robust line centroids for each\nchannel map and fit a number of Keplerian disc models to the velocity field.\nThe gas kinematics of the CQ Tau disc present non-Keplerian features, showing\nbent and twisted iso-velocity curves in 12CO and 13CO. Significant spiral\nstructures are detected between 10-180 au in both the brightness temperature\nand the rotation velocity of 12CO after subtraction of an azimuthally symmetric\nmodel, which may be tracing planet-disc interactions with an embedded planet or\nlow-mass companion. We identify three spirals, two in the brightness\ntemperature and one in the velocity residuals, spanning a large azimuth and\nradial extent. The brightness temperature spirals are morphologically connected\nto spirals observed in NIR scattered light in the same disc, indicating a\ncommon origin. Together with the observed large dust and gas cavity, the\nspirals support the hypothesis of a massive embedded companion in the CQ Tau\ndisc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2020 19:07:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-07"}

Spontaneous\nparametric down conversion (SPDC) is a commonly used source of entangled\nphotons in which pump photons convert to a signal-idler pair. We propose to\nsearch for \"dark SPDC\" (dSPDC) events in which a new dark sector particle\nreplaces the idler. Though it does not interact, the presence of a dark\nparticle can be inferred by the properties of the signal photon. Examples of\ndark states include axion-like-particles and dark photons. We show that the\npresence of an optical medium opens the phase space of the down-conversion\nprocess, or decay, which would be forbidden in vacuum.

However, glass, a brittle\nmaterial, has its vulnerability to fracture. Processes such as heat treatment\n(heat tempering) or chemical strengthening through ion-exchange have been used\nto create residual stress profiles on the glass, in a bid to improve its\nfracture strength. However, failure still occurs, which is mostly catastrophic\nand expensive to repair. Therefore understanding, predicting, and eventually\nimproving the resistance to damage or fracture of chemically strengthened glass\nis important to designing new glasses that would be tougher while retaining\ntheir transparency. The relationship between the glass residual stress\nparameters such as the compressive stress (CS), depth of compression layer\n(DOL), and central tension (CT) versus apparent (effective) fracture toughness\nfor different crack depth was investigated in this study using a Silicon\nCarbide particle blast plus ring-on-ring (RoR) test method. The results also\nshowed that improving the fracture resistance of glass via chemical\nstrengthening requires a proper combination of CS, DOL, and CT, which is\nparticularly dependent on the initial/existing crack (flaw) depth. It was\ndetermined that for a damage event involving the introduction of a shallow\ncrack depth, the criterion for optimal resistance to fracture, in terms of\napparent fracture toughness, is weighted more towards a high CS, than deep DOL\nwhile for a deep flaw damage event, it is more weighted towards deep DOL, than\na high CS. These results provide a valuable piece of information in the design\nof a more robust glass in engineering applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2020 20:47:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-10"}

Three types of layers are\nproduced per obliquity cycle: a ~30 m-thick dust-rich (~25% dust VMR) layer\nforms at high obliquity, a ~0.5 m-thick dust lag forms at low obliquity, and\ntwo ~10 m-thick dust-poor (~3%) layers form when obliquity is\nincreasing/decreasing. The ~30 m-thick dust-rich layer is reminiscent of a ~30\nm feature derived from visible imagery analysis the north PLD, while the ~0.5\nm-thick dust lag is a factor of ~2 smaller than observed \"thin layers\".\nOverall, this investigation provides further evidence for obliquity forcing in\nthe PLD climate record, and demonstrates the importance of ice-on-dust\nnucleation in polar depositional processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2020 21:19:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-10"}

These specialized cells utilize an internal active amplifier to\nachieve highly sensitive mechanical detection. One of the manifestations of\nthis active process is the occurrence of spontaneous limit-cycle motion of the\nhair cell bundle. As hair bundles under in vivo conditions are typically\ncoupled to each other by overlying structures, we explore the role of this\ncoupling on the dynamics of the system, using a combination of theoretical and\nexperimental approaches. Our numerical model suggests that the presence of\nchaotic dynamics in the response of individual bundles enhances their ability\nto synchronize when coupled, resulting in significant improvement in the\nsystem's ability to detect weak signals. This synchronization persists even for\na large frequency dispersion and a large number of oscillators comprising the\nsystem. Further, the amplitude and coherence of the active motion is not\nreduced upon increasing the number of oscillators. Using artificial membranes,\nwe impose mechanical coupling on groups of live and functional hair bundles,\nselected from in vitro preparations of the sensory epithelium, allowing us to\nexplore the role of coupling experimentally. Consistent with the numerical\nsimulations of the chaotic system, synchronization occurs even for large\nfrequency dispersion and a large number of hair cells. Further, the amplitude\nand coherence of the spontaneous oscillations are independent of the number of\nhair cells in the network. We therefore propose that hair cells utilize their\nchaotic dynamics to stabilize the synchronized state and avoid the amplitude\ndeath regime, resulting in collective coherent motion that could play a role in\ngenerating spontaneous otoacoustic emissions and an enhanced ability to detect\nweak signals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2020 21:59:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-31"}

Conditional Adversarial\nGenerative Networks (cGANs) use a conditioning factor to generate images and\nhave shown great success in recent years. Intuitively, the information in an\nimage can be divided into two parts: 1) content which is presented through the\nconditioning vector and 2) style which is the undiscovered information missing\nfrom the conditioning vector. Current practices in using cGANs for medical\nimage generation, only use a single variable for image generation (i.e.,\ncontent) and therefore, do not provide much flexibility nor control over the\ngenerated image. In this work we propose a methodology to learn from the image\nitself, disentangled representations of style and content, and use this\ninformation to impose control over the generation process. In this framework,\nstyle is learned in a fully unsupervised manner, while content is learned\nthrough both supervised learning (using the conditioning vector) and\nunsupervised learning (with the inference mechanism). We undergo two novel\nregularization steps to ensure content-style disentanglement. First, we\nminimize the shared information between content and style by introducing a\nnovel application of the gradient reverse layer (GRL); second, we introduce a\nself-supervised regularization method to further separate information in the\ncontent and style variables. We show that in general, two latent variable\nmodels achieve better performance and give more control over the generated\nimage. We also show that our proposed model (DRAI) achieves the best\ndisentanglement score and has the best overall performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2020 22:10:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 16 May 2021 02:35:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 3 May 2022 23:53:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-05"}

A\nrecent study has proposed a charging infrastructure planning tool to support\nintercity trips for the estimated EV market share (6 percent) in Michigan for\n2030. The main goal of this study is to estimate the emission reduction\nassociated with this electrification rate and infrastructure investment for\nlight duty vehicles. To this end, a state-of-the-art emission estimation\nframework is proposed to be applied to the state-wide intercity travels. The\nmain contributions of the proposed framework includes: 1) Incorporating a micro\nemission estimation model for simulated vehicle trajectories of the intercity\nnetwork of Michigan, 2) Adjusting the micro emission model results considering\nimpacts of monthly travel demand and temperature variations, and heterogeneity\nof vehicles based on their make, model, and age. The emission estimation\nframework is then compared with the traditional VMT analysis method as a\nbenchmark. Finally, five different scenarios are explored for EV adoption to\nassess potential emission savings from the given electrification rate for each\nscenario. The results suggest an annual CO2 emission savings of 0.58-0.92\nmillion-ton. The CO2 social cost savings may justify the investment on the\nnetwork electrification.

This concept,\nnamed \"spectroscopic fourth-order coronagraphy\", is based on a fourth-order\ncoronagraph with a focal-plane mask that modulates the complex amplitude of the\nAiry disk along one direction. While coronagraphs applying the complex\namplitude mask can achieve the theoretical limit performance for any arbitrary\npupils, the focal plane mask severely limits the bandwidth. Here, focusing on\nthe fact that the focal-plane mask modulates the complex amplitude along one\ndirection, we noticed that the mask can be optimized for each spectral element\ngenerated by a spectrograph. We combine the fourth-order coronagraph with two\nspectrographs to produce a stellar spectrum on the focal plane and reconstruct\na white pupil on the Lyot stop.

Experimentally, a\ndouble-layer viscosity is generated by superposing two miscible fluids with\nsimilar densities but different dynamic viscosities. A synthetic helical\nmagnetically-driven swimmer is then made to move across the viscosity gradients\nalong four different configurations: either head-first (pusher swimmer) or\ntail-first (puller), and through either positive (i.e. going from low to high\nviscosity) or negative viscosity gradients. We observe qualitative differences\nin the penetration dynamics for each case. We find that the swimming speed can\neither increase or decrease while swimming across the viscosity interface,\nwhich results from the fact that the head and the tail of the swimmer can be in\nenvironments in which the local viscosity leads to different relative amounts\nof drag and thrust. In order to rationalize the experimental measurements, we\nnext develop a theoretical hydrodynamic model. We assume that the classical\nresistive-force theory of slender filaments is locally valid along the helical\npropeller and use it to calculate the swimming speed as a function of the\nposition of the swimmer relative to the fluid-fluid interface. The predictions\nof the model agree well with experiments for the case of positive viscosity\ngradients. When crossing across a negative gradient, gravitational forces in\nthe experiment become important, and we modify the model to include buoyancy,\nwhich agrees with experiments.

We develop\ncoupling techniques tailored to the setting of high-dimensional regression with\nshrinkage priors, which enable practical, non-asymptotic diagnostics of\nconvergence without relying on traceplots or long-run asymptotics. By\nestablishing geometric drift and minorization conditions for the algorithm\nunder consideration, we prove that the proposed couplings have finite expected\nmeeting time. Focusing on a class of shrinkage priors which includes the\n'Horseshoe', we empirically demonstrate the scalability of the proposed\ncouplings. A highlight of our findings is that less than 1000 iterations can be\nenough for a Gibbs sampler to reach stationarity in a regression on 100,000\ncovariates. The numerical results also illustrate the impact of the prior on\nthe computational efficiency of the coupling, and suggest the use of priors\nwhere the local precisions are Half-t distributed with degree of freedom larger\nthan one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2020 00:16:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Jan 2021 23:51:33 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 10 Jul 2021 03:03:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-13"}

In the model presented, the generation of BBSAN is assumed to arise from\nthe non-linear interaction between downstream-propagating coherent structures\nwith the quasi-periodic shock cells in the jet plume. The turbulent\nperturbations are represented as axially-extended wavepackets and the shock\ncells are modelled as a set of stationary waveguide modes. Unlike previous\nBBSAN models, the physical parameters describing the hydrodynamic components\nare not scaled using the acoustic field. Instead, the characteristics of both\nthe turbulent and shock components are educed from large-eddy simulation and\nparticle image velocimetry datasets. Apart from using extracted data, a\nreduced-order description of the wavepacket structure is obtained using\nparabolised stability equations (PSE). The validity of the model is tested by\ncomparing far-field sound pressure level predictions to azimuthally-decomposed\nexperimental acoustic data from a cold Mach 1.5 underexpanded jet. At polar\nangles and frequencies where BBSAN dominates, good agreement in spectral shape\nand sound amplitude is observed for the first three azimuthal modes.\nEncouraging comparisons of the radiated noise spectra, in both frequency and\namplitude, reinforce the suitability of using reduced-order linear wavepacket\nsources for predicting BBSAN peaks. On the other hand, the mismatch in sound\namplitude at interpeak frequencies reveals the role of wavepacket jitter in the\nunderlying sound generating mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2020 01:52:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-19"}

Several possible explanations have been\nfloated, including greater detection of mild cases due to expanded testing,\nshifts in age distribution among the infected, lags between confirmed cases and\nreported deaths, improvements in treatment, mutations in the virus, and\ndecreased viral load as a result of mask-wearing. Using both Florida line-level\ndata and recently released (but incomplete) national line level data from April\n1, 2020 to November 1, 2020 on cases, hospitalizations, and deaths--each\nstratified by age--we unpack the drop in case fatality rate (CFR). Under the\nhypothesis that improvements in treatment efficacy should correspond to\ndecreases in hospitalization fatality rate (HFR), we find that improvements in\nthe national data do not always match the story told by Florida data. In the\nnational data, treatment improvements between the first wave and the second\nwave appear substantial, but modest when compared to the drop in aggregate CFR.\nBy contrast, possibly due to constrained resources in a much larger second\npeak, Florida data suggests comparatively little difference between the first\nand second wave, with HFR slightly increasing in every age group. However, by\nNovember 1st, both Florida and national data suggest significant decreases in\nage-stratified HFR since April 1st. By accounting for several confounding\nfactors, our analysis shows how age-stratified HFR can provide a more realistic\npicture of treatment improvements than CFR. One key limitation of our analysis\nis that the national line-level data remains incomplete and plagued by\nartifacts. Our analysis highlights the crucial role that this data can play but\nalso the pressing need for public, complete, and high-quality age-stratified\nline-level data for both cases, hospitalizations, and deaths for all states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2020 02:25:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Dec 2020 07:41:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-14"}

First-order methods, such as the\nstochastic gradient method and Adam, are often used to find global minima.\nRecently, the consensus-based optimization (CBO) method has been introduced as\none of the gradient-free optimization methods and its convergence is proven\nwith dimension-dependent parameters, which may suffer from the curse of\ndimensionality. By replacing the isotropic geometric Brownian motion with the\ncomponent-wise one, the latest improvement of the CBO method is guaranteed to\nconverge to the global minimizer with dimension-independent parameters,\nalthough the initial data need to be well-chosen.

Advantages of the Adam-CBO method\ninclude: (1) capable of finding global minima of non-convex objective functions\nwith high success rates and low costs; (2) can handle non-differentiable\nactivation functions and thus approximate low-regularity functions with better\naccuracy.

The self-training scheme involves iterative\nprocessing of target data; it generates target pseudo labels and retrains the\nnetwork. However, since only the confident predictions are taken as pseudo\nlabels, existing self-training approaches inevitably produce sparse pseudo\nlabels in practice. We see this is critical because the resulting insufficient\ntraining-signals lead to a suboptimal, error-prone model. In order to tackle\nthis problem, we propose a novel Two-phase Pseudo Label Densification\nframework, referred to as TPLD. In the first phase, we use sliding window\nvoting to propagate the confident predictions, utilizing intrinsic\nspatial-correlations in the images.

Nevertheless, CNNs typically require a\nlarge amount of well-labeled data for training, which may not be available in\nmany biomedical image classification applications, especially when diseases are\nrare and where labeling by experts is costly.\n  This paper makes two contributions to address this issue: (1) It extends the\nconventional twin neural network and introduces a training method for low-shot\nlearning when labeled data are limited and imbalanced, and (2) it introduces a\nnovel semi-supervised learning strategy that uses additional unlabeled training\ndata to achieve greater accuracy.

In this work, we\ndemonstrate that the Markovian closed-loop Nash equilibrium of (i) is\nequivalent to that of (iv) for the LQG case. These two studies answer the\nlong-standing questions about the consistency of the solutions to major-minor\nLQG MFG systems derived using different approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2020 05:02:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 27 Feb 2021 16:30:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 18 Oct 2022 02:34:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-19"}

In this paper, we\ninvestigate the complimentary roles of spatial and temporal information and\npropose a novel dynamic spatiotemporal network (DS-Net) for more effective\nfusion of spatiotemporal information.

The north-east and\nwest extended structures are aligned with the galactic disk and dust lane in\nthe HST $V-H$ map, and located at the peak of molecular gas distribution.

If a patient\nhas a willing living donor with whom the patient is not compatible, the pair\npatient--donor can join a pool of incompatible pairs and, if compatibility\nbetween patient and donor in two our more pairs exists, organs can be exchanged\nbetween them. The problem can be modeled as an integer program that, in\ngeneral, aims at finding the pairs that should be selected for transplant such\nthat maximum number of transplants is performed. In this paper we consider that\nfor each patient there may exist a preference order over the organs that he/she\ncan receive, since a patient may be compatible with several donors but may have\na better fit over some than over others. Under this setting, the aim is to find\nthe maximum cardinality stable exchange, a solution where no blocking cycle\nexists. For this purpose we propose three novel integer programming models\nbased on the well-known edge and cycle formulations. These formulations are\nadjusted for both finding stable and strongly stable exchanges under strict\npreferences and for the case when ties in preferences may exist. Furthermore,\nwe study a situation when the stability requirement can be relaxed by\naddressing the trade-off between maximum cardinality versus number of blocking\ncycles allowed in a solution.

First observed in conical diffraction\nin the 1830s, the field of polarization singularities has been systematically\nreshaped and deepened by many pioneers of wave optics. Together with other\nexotic phenomena such as non-Hermiticity and topology, polarization\nsingularities have been introduced into the vibrant field of nanophotonics,\nrendering unprecedented flexibilities for manipulations of light-matter\ninteractions at the nanoscale. Here we review the recent results on the\ngeneration and observation of polarization singularities in metaphotonics. We\nstart with the discussion of polarization singularities in the Mie theory,\nwhere both electric and magnetic multipoles are explored from perspectives of\nlocal and global polarization properties. We then proceed with the discussion\nof various photonic-crystal structures, for which both near- and far-field\npatterns manifest diverse polarization singularities characterized by the\ninteger Poincare or more general half-integer Hopf indices (topological\ncharges). Next, we review the most recent studies of conversions from\npolarization to phase singularities in scalar wave optics, demonstrating how\nbound states in the continuum can be exploited to generate directly optical\nvortices of various charges. Throughout our paper, we discuss and highlight\nseveral fundamental concepts and demonstrate their close connections and\nspecial links to metaphotonics.

Traditionally\nsuccessful countermeasures such as synthetic over-sampling have had limited\nsuccess with complex, structured data handled by deep learning models. In this\nwork, we propose to use a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) equipped with a\ngenerator network G, a discriminator network D and a classifier network C to\nremove the class-imbalance in visual data sets. The generator network is\ninitialized with auto-encoder to make it stable. The discriminator D ensures\nthat G adheres to class distribution of imbalanced class. In conventional\nmethods, where Generator G competes with discriminator D in a min-max game, we\npropose to further add an additional classifier network to the original\nnetwork. Now, the generator network tries to compete in a min-max game with\nDiscriminator as well as the new classifier that we have introduced. An\nadditional condition is enforced on generator network G to produce points in\nthe convex hull of desired imbalanced class. Further the contention of\nadversarial game with classifier C, pushes conditional distribution learned by\nG towards the periphery of the respective class, compensating the problem of\nclass imbalance. Experimental evidence shows that this initialization results\nin stable training of the network.

These models exploit the explicit transformations\nthat are often available between an unobserved parameter space (objects) and\neach one of the observation spaces (sensors). We formulate the problem as a\nlikelihood maximization task and we derive the associated conjugate\nexpectation-maximization algorithm. The convergence properties of the proposed\nalgorithm are thoroughly investigated. Several local/global optimization\ntechniques are proposed in order to increase its convergence speed. Two\ninitialization strategies are proposed and compared. A consistent\nmodel-selection criterion is proposed. The algorithm and its variants are\ntested and evaluated within the task of 3D localization of several speakers\nusing both auditory and visual data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2020 10:13:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-10"}

In particular, by\ntranslating speech audio data without intermediate transcription, direct ST\nmodels are able to leverage and preserve essential information present in the\ninput (e.g. speaker's vocal characteristics) that is otherwise lost in the\ncascade framework. Although such ability proved to be useful for gender\ntranslation, direct ST is nonetheless affected by gender bias just like its\ncascade counterpart, as well as machine translation and numerous other natural\nlanguage processing applications. Moreover, direct ST systems that exclusively\nrely on vocal biometric features as a gender cue can be unsuitable and\npotentially harmful for certain users. Going beyond speech signals, in this\npaper we compare different approaches to inform direct ST models about the\nspeaker's gender and test their ability to handle gender translation from\nEnglish into Italian and French. To this aim, we manually annotated large\ndatasets with speakers' gender information and used them for experiments\nreflecting different possible real-world scenarios.

While the tight coupling of these two components has been\nregarded as the key for supporting CEP at high performance, such dependencies\npose several inherent challenges as follows. (1) Application development atop a\nCEP system requires extensive knowledge of how the runtime system operates,\nwhich is typically highly complex in nature.

Here, we study the\nunderlying hole spin physics of the first hole in a silicon planar MOS quantum\ndot. We show that non-uniform electrode-induced strain produces nanometre-scale\nvariations in the HH-LH splitting. Importantly, we find that this\n\\RR{non-uniform strain causes} the HH-LH splitting to vary by up to 50\\% across\nthe active region of the quantum dot. We show that local electric fields can be\nused to displace the hole relative to the non-uniform strain profile, allowing\na new mechanism for electric modulation of the hole g-tensor.

Two frameworks categorize these counting methods. Framework 1 describes\nselected mathematical properties of counting methods, and Framework 2 describes\narguments for choosing a counting method. Twenty of the 32 counting methods are\nrank-dependent, fractionalized, and introduced to measure contribution,\nparticipation, etc. of an object of study. Next, three criteria for internal\nvalidity are used to identify five methods that test the adequacy of counting\nmethods, two elements that test sensitivity, and three elements that test\nhomogeneity of the counting methods. These methods and elements may be used to\nassess the internal validity of counting methods. Finally, a literature search\nfinds research evaluations that use the counting methods. Only three of the 32\ncounting methods are used by four research evaluations or more. Of these three\ncounting methods, two are used with the same characteristics as defined in the\nstudies that introduced the counting methods.\n  The review provides practitioners in research evaluation and researchers in\nbibliometrics with a detailed foundation for working with counting methods. At\nthe same time, many of the findings in the review provide bases for future\ninvestigations of counting methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2020 11:29:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-22"}

However, the one-hot representation may\nnot adequately reflect the relation between the instances and labels, as labels\nare often not completely independent and instances may relate to multiple\nlabels in practice. The inadequate one-hot representations tend to train the\nmodel to be over-confident, which may result in arbitrary prediction and model\noverfitting, especially for confused datasets (datasets with very similar\nlabels) or noisy datasets (datasets with labeling errors). While training\nmodels with label smoothing (LS) can ease this problem in some degree, it still\nfails to capture the realistic relation among labels. In this paper, we propose\na novel Label Confusion Model (LCM) as an enhancement component to current\npopular text classification models. LCM can learn label confusion to capture\nsemantic overlap among labels by calculating the similarity between instances\nand labels during training and generate a better label distribution to replace\nthe original one-hot label vector, thus improving the final classification\nperformance. Extensive experiments on five text classification benchmark\ndatasets reveal the effectiveness of LCM for several widely used deep learning\nclassification models. Further experiments also verify that LCM is especially\nhelpful for confused or noisy datasets and superior to the label smoothing\nmethod.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2020 11:34:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-10"}

This is exacerbated in some structured prediction tasks, such as\nsemantic segmentation, which requires pixel-level annotations. This work\naddresses weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS), with the goal of\nbridging the gap between image-level annotations and pixel-level segmentation.\nWe formulate WSSS as a novel group-wise learning task that explicitly models\nsemantic dependencies in a group of images to estimate more reliable pseudo\nground-truths, which can be used for training more accurate segmentation\nmodels. In particular, we devise a graph neural network (GNN) for group-wise\nsemantic mining, wherein input images are represented as graph nodes, and the\nunderlying relations between a pair of images are characterized by an efficient\nco-attention mechanism. Moreover, in order to prevent the model from paying\nexcessive attention to common semantics only, we further propose a graph\ndropout layer, encouraging the model to learn more accurate and complete object\nresponses. The whole network is end-to-end trainable by iterative message\npassing, which propagates interaction cues over the images to progressively\nimprove the performance. We conduct experiments on the popular PASCAL VOC 2012\nand COCO benchmarks, and our model yields state-of-the-art performance.

Trajectories provide detailed views on specific routes, but\ntypically do not capture all traffic. Loop detectors capture all traffic flow\nat specific locations instead, but provide no information on individual routes.\nGiven a set of loop-detector measurements and a set of representative\ntrajectories, our goal is to investigate how one can effectively combine these\ntwo partial data sources to create a more complete picture of the underlying\nmobility. Specifically, we want to reconstruct a realistic set of routes from\nthe loop-detector data, using the given trajectories as representatives of\ntypical behavior.\n  We model loop-detector data as a network flow that needs to be covered by the\nreconstructed routes and we capture realism of the routes via the Fr\\'echet\ndistance to the representatives. We prove that several forms of the resulting\nproblem are NP-hard. Hence we explore heuristics that decompose the flow well\nwhile following the representatives to varying degrees. First we propose the\nFr\\'echet Routes (FR) heuristic which generates candidates routes with bounded\nFr\\'echet distance. Second we describe a variant of multi-commodity min-cost\nflow (MCMCF) which is loosely coupled to the trajectories. Lastly we consider\nglobal min-cost flow (GMCF) which is essentially agnostic to the\nrepresentatives.\n  We evaluate these approaches on synthetic and real-world trajectory data with\na map-matched ground truth. We find that GMCF explains the flow best, but\nproduces a large number of routes (significantly more than the ground truth);\nthese routes are often nonsensical. MCMCF produces a large number of mostly\nrealistic routes which explain the flow reasonably well. In contrast, FR\nproduces significantly smaller sets of realistic routes that still explain the\nflow well, albeit with a higher running time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2020 12:57:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-10"}

Features extracted by the neural\ncomponents define the structured context of labelled examples and the\nconfidence of the neural predictions determines the level of noise of the\nexamples. Using the scoring function of FastLAS, NSL searches for short,\ninterpretable rules that generalise over such noisy examples. We evaluate our\nframework on propositional and first-order classification tasks using the MNIST\ndataset as raw data.

However, the question of whether this trade-off\nexists in empirical human brain networks and, if so, how it takes effect is\nstill not well understood. Here, we employed a multiobjective evolutionary\nalgorithm to directly and quantitatively explore the cost-efficiency trade-off\nin human brain networks. Using this algorithm, we generated a population of\nsynthetic networks with optimal but diverse cost-efficiency trade-offs. It was\nfound that these synthetic networks could not only reproduce a large portion of\nconnections in the empirical brain networks but also embed a resembling\nsmall-world structure. Moreover, the synthetic and empirical brain networks\nwere found similar in terms of the spatial arrangement of hub regions and the\nmodular structure, which are two important topological features widely assumed\nto be outcomes of cost-efficiency trade-offs. The synthetic networks had high\nrobustness against random attack as the empirical brain networks did.\nAdditionally, we also revealed some differences of the synthetic networks from\nthe empirical brain networks, including lower segregated processing capacity\nand weaker robustness against targeted attack. These findings provide direct\nand quantitative evidence that the structure of human brain networks is indeed\nlargely influenced by optimal cost-efficiency trade-offs. We also suggest that\nsome additional factors (e.g., segregated processing capacity) might jointly\ndetermine the network organization with cost and efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2020 13:37:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-10"}

Recent changes, specifically, the\nincreasing renewable integration, have challenged such assumptions. In light of\nthis shift, this thesis intends to devise new frameworks and advance our\nunderstanding of the future markets. The first part focuses on mechanism design\nwhen the model fully reflects the physics of the grid and the participants. We\nconsider a market that involves continuous goods, general nonconvex\nconstraints, and second stage costs. We then design the payments and conditions\nunder which coalitions cannot influence the outcome. Under the\nincentive-compatible VCG mechanism, we prove that coalition-proof outcomes are\nachieved if bids are convex and constraints are polymatroids. By relaxing\nincentive-compatibility, we investigate core-selecting mechanisms that are\ncoalition-proof without conditions. We show that they generalize the economic\nrationale of the LMP mechanism, and can approximate truthfulness without the\nprice-taking assumption. Finally, they are budget-balanced. The second part\ncoordinates regional markets to exploit the geographic diversification of\nrenewables. In Europe, reserves remain an exclusive responsibility of regional\noperators. This limited coordination and the sequential structure hinder the\nutilization of generation and transmission. To promote reserve exchange, a\npreemptive model can optimally withdraw inter-area transmission capacity from\nday-ahead energy for reserves. This bilevel program however does not suggest\ncosts that guarantee coordination. We formulate a new preemptive model that\nallows us to obtain stable benefits immune to deviations. Our proposal,\nleast-core benefits, achieves minimal stability violation with a tractable\ncomputation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2020 13:50:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-10"}

Tubal rank is only defined on one mode of third\norder tensor without low rank structure in the other two modes. That is, low\nrank structures on the other two modes are missing. Motivated by this, we first\nintroduce multi-tubal rank, and then establish a relationship between\nmulti-tubal rank and Tucker rank. Based on the multi-tubal rank, we propose a\nnovel low rank tensor completion model. For this model, a tensor factorization\nbased method is applied and the corresponding convergence anlysis is\nestablished. In addition, spatio-temporal characteristics are intrinsic\nfeatures in video and internet traffic tensor data. To get better performance,\nwe make full use of such features and improve the established tensor completion\nmodel.

It relies on sophisticated data processing to reach high\ncontrasts at small angular separations. Most data processing techniques of this\ntype are based on the angular differential imaging (ADI) observing strategy to\nperform the reference PSF subtraction, and generally make use of\nsignal-to-noise (S/N) maps to infer the existence of planetary signals via\nthresholding. An alternative method for generating the final detection map was\nrecently proposed with the regime-switching model (RSM) map, which uses a\nregime-switching framework to generate a probability map based on cubes of\nresiduals generated by different PSF subtraction techniques. In this paper, we\npresent several improvements to the original RSM map, focusing on novel PSF\nsubtraction techniques and their optimal combinations, as well as a new\nprocedure for estimating the probabilities involved. We started by implementing\ntwo forward-model versions of the RSM map algorithm based on the LOCI and KLIP\nPSF subtraction techniques. We then addressed the question of optimally\nselecting the PSF subtraction techniques to optimise the overall performance of\nthe RSM map. A new forward-backward approach was also implemented to take into\naccount both past and future observations to compute the RSM map probabilities,\nleading to improved precision in terms of astrometry and lowering the\nbackground speckle noise. We tested the ability of these various improvements\nto increase the performance of the RSM map based on different data sets via a\ncomputation of ROC curves. These results demonstrate the benefits of these\nproposed improvements. Finally, we present a new framework to generate contrast\ncurves based on probability maps. The contrast curves highlight the higher\nperformance of the RSM map compared to a standard S/N map at small angular\nseparations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2020 14:55:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-10"}

However, computing task competition\ninvolving limited resources increases the task processing latency and energy\nconsumption of mobile devices, as well as time constraints. Mobile edge\ncomputing (MEC) has been widely used to address these problems. However, there\nare limitations to existing methods used during computation offloading. On the\none hand, they focus on independent tasks rather than dependent tasks. The\nchallenges of task dependency in the real world, especially task segmentation\nand integration, remain to be addressed. On the other hand, the multiuser\nscenarios related to resource allocation and the mutex access problem must be\nconsidered. In this paper, we propose a novel offloading approach, Com-DDPG,\nfor MEC using multiagent reinforcement learning to enhance the offloading\nperformance. First, we discuss the task dependency model, task priority model,\nenergy consumption model, and average latency from the perspective of server\nclusters and multidependence on mobile tasks. Our method based on these models\nis introduced to formalize communication behavior among multiple agents; then,\nreinforcement learning is executed as an offloading strategy to obtain the\nresults. Because of the incomplete state information, long short-term memory\n(LSTM) is employed as a decision-making tool to assess the internal state.\nMoreover, to optimize and support effective action, we consider using a\nbidirectional recurrent neural network (BRNN) to learn and enhance features\nobtained from agents' communication. Finally, we simulate experiments on the\nAlibaba cluster dataset.

When each device completes one\ntransmission, due to possible transmission failure, two cases with and without\ntransmission feedback to each device must be considered. Particularly, for the\ncase with no feedback, the device uses policy (I): It will go to an idle state\nand release the channel regardless of the outcome of the transmission. For the\ncase with perfect feedback, if the transmission succeeds, the device will go to\nan idle state, otherwise, it uses either policy (W), i.e., it will go to a\nwaiting state and re-contend for channel access; or it uses policy (S), i.e.,\nit will stay at a service state and occupy this channel to attempt another\ntransmission. For those three policies, the closed-form expressions of the\naverage age of information (AoI) of each device are characterized under schemes\nwith and without preemption in service. It is shown that, for each policy, the\nscheme with preemption in service always achieves a smaller average AoI,\ncompared with the scheme without preemption. Then, a mean-field approximation\napproach with guaranteed accuracy is developed to analyze the asymptotic\nperformance for the considered system with an infinite number of devices and\nthe effects of the system parameters on the average AoI are characterized.\nSimulation results show that the proposed mean-field approximation is accurate\neven for a small number of devices. The results also show that policy (S)\nachieves the smallest average AoI compared with policies (I) and (W), and the\naverage AoI does not always decrease with the arrival rate for all three\npolicies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2020 15:30:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-10"}

At each step a card is chosen uniformly from the pack\nand then transposed with another card chosen uniformly from below it. This\ndefines a random walk on the symmetric group generated by a distribution which\nis non-constant on the conjugacy class of transpositions. Nevertheless, we\nprovide an explicit formula for all eigenvalues of the shuffle by demonstrating\na useful correspondence between eigenvalues and standard Young tableaux. This\nallows us to prove the existence of a total-variation cutoff for the one-sided\ntransposition shuffle at time $n\\log n$. We also study weighted generalisations\nof the one-sided transposition shuffle called biased one-sided transposition\nshuffles. We compute the full spectrum for every biased one-sided transposition\nshuffle, and prove the existence of a total variation cutoff for certain\nchoices of weighted distribution. In particular, we recover the eigenvalues and\nwell known mixing time of the classical random transposition shuffle. We study\nthe hyperoctahedral group as an extension of the symmetric group, and formulate\nthe one-sided transposition shuffle and random transposition shuffle as random\nwalks on this new group. We determine the spectrum of each hyperoctahedral\nshuffle by developing a correspondence between their eigenvalues and standard\nYoung bi-tableaux. We prove that the one-sided transposition shuffle on the\nhyperoctahedral group exhibits a cutoff at $n\\log n$, the same time as its\nsymmetric group counterpart.

However, existing\nICN architectures are limited in terms of data plane programmability due to the\nlack of (i) in-network processing and (ii) data plane programming abstractions.\nSuch architectures can benefit from Complex Event Processing (CEP), an\nin-network processing paradigm to efficiently process data inside the data\nplane.

In contrast, a change to producer-initiated interaction, as\nfavored by CEP, imposes severe limitations for request-reply interactions.

This\nis in contrast to the \"open world\" setting where DNNs are envisioned to be\ndeployed to. From a functional safety point of view, the ability to detect\nso-called \"out-of-distribution\" (OoD) samples, i.e., objects outside of a DNN's\nsemantic space, is crucial for many applications such as automated driving. A\nnatural baseline approach to OoD detection is to threshold on the pixel-wise\nsoftmax entropy. We present a two-step procedure that significantly improves\nthat approach. Firstly, we utilize samples from the COCO dataset as OoD proxy\nand introduce a second training objective to maximize the softmax entropy on\nthese samples. Starting from pretrained semantic segmentation networks we\nre-train a number of DNNs on different in-distribution datasets and\nconsistently observe improved OoD detection performance when evaluating on\ncompletely disjoint OoD datasets. Secondly, we perform a transparent\npost-processing step to discard false positive OoD samples by so-called \"meta\nclassification\". To this end, we apply linear models to a set of hand-crafted\nmetrics derived from the DNN's softmax probabilities. In our experiments we\nconsistently observe a clear additional gain in OoD detection performance,\ncutting down the number of detection errors by up to 52% when comparing the\nbest baseline with our results.

The\ngoal of a ranking system is to help a user find the items they are looking for\nwith the least amount of effort. Thus the rankings they produce should place\nthe most relevant or preferred items at the top of the ranking. Learning to\nrank is a field within machine learning that covers methods which optimize\nranking systems w.r.t. this goal. Traditional supervised learning to rank\nmethods utilize expert-judgements to evaluate and learn, however, in many\nsituations such judgements are impossible or infeasible to obtain. As a\nsolution, methods have been introduced that perform learning to rank based on\nuser clicks instead. The difficulty with clicks is that they are not only\naffected by user preferences, but also by what rankings were displayed.\nTherefore, these methods have to prevent being biased by other factors than\nuser preference.

We demonstrate that\nknowledge of game type leads to an assumption of mirrored best responses and\nfaster convergence than Nash-Q. Specifically, the Friend-or-Foe algorithm\ndemonstrates signs of convergence to a Set Controller which jointly chooses\nactions for two agents.

A key novelty in our work stems\nfrom the explicit optimization of intermediate representations for the AD task.\nIndeed, differently from commonly used approaches that consider a neural\nnetwork as a single computational block, i.e., using the output of the last\nlayer only, MOCCA explicitly leverages the multi-layer structure of deep\narchitectures. Each layer's feature space is optimized for AD during training,\nwhile in the test phase, the deep representations extracted from the trained\nlayers are combined to detect anomalies. With MOCCA, we split the training\nprocess into two steps. First, the autoencoder is trained on the reconstruction\ntask only. Then, we only retain the encoder tasked with minimizing the L_2\ndistance between the output representation and a reference point, the\nanomaly-free training data centroid, at each considered layer.

The effectiveness of our proposed Outlier Detection model is\nevaluated by conducting experiments on Network Intrusion Dataset with\nevaluation metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy.\nExperimental results show that the classification accuracy of cyber anomalies\nhas been improved after removing outliers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2020 05:09:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-11"}

Continuous use of these\nsubstances can ultimately lead a human to disastrous consequences. As patients\ndisplay a high rate of relapse, prevention at an early stage can be an\neffective restraint. We therefore propose a binary classifier to identify any\nindividual's present vulnerability towards substance abuse by analyzing\nsubjects' socio-economic environment. We have collected data by a questionnaire\nwhich is created after carefully assessing the commonly involved factors behind\nsubstance abuse. Pearson's chi-squared test of independence is used to identify\nkey feature variables influencing substance abuse. Later we build the\npredictive classifiers using machine learning classification algorithms on\nthose variables. Logistic regression classifier trained with 18 features can\npredict individual vulnerability with the best accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2020 05:21:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-12"}

Extracting the exact section and re-observing the extracted\nvideo section in detail is important for imitating complex skills because human\nmotions give valuable hints for robots. However, the general video\nunderstanding methods focus more on the understanding of the full frame,lacking\nconsideration on extracting accurate sections and aligning them with the\nhuman's intent. We propose a Learning-from-Observation framework that splits\nand understands a video of a human demonstration with verbal instructions to\nextract accurate action sequences. The splitting is done based on local minimum\npoints of the hand velocity, which align human daily-life actions with\nobject-centered face contact transitions required for generating robot motion.\nThen, we extract a motion description on the split videos using video\ncaptioning techniques that are trained from our new daily-life action video\ndataset. Finally, we match the motion descriptions with the verbal instructions\nto understand the correct human intent and ignore the unintended actions inside\nthe video. We evaluate the validity of hand velocity-based video splitting and\ndemonstrate that it is effective. The experimental results on our new video\ncaptioning dataset focusing on daily-life human actions demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method. The source code, trained models, and the\ndataset will be made available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2020 05:22:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-14"}

However, it is found\nthat some formulas from RQMEs were lost in Schr\\\"odinger equation. For example,\na free relativistic particle has positive and negative energy branches. The\nformer includes positive kinetic energy (PKE) and the latter negative kinetic\nenergy (NKE). The latter should be treated on an equal footing as the former.\nNevertheless, from Schr\\\"odinger equation, a free particle can have only PKE.\nStarting from RQMEs and taking low momentum approximation, we derive NKE\nSchr\\\"odinger equation which is for the cases that free particles have NKE.\nThus negative energy branch of RQMEs can be retained in low momentum motion. We\npoint out a fact that whether Schr\\\"odinger equation is applicable in a region\nwhere a particle's energy E is less than potential V, E<V, has never been\nquantitatively verified. In such a region NKE Schr\\\"odinger equation should be\nemployed. With the help of NKE Schr\\\"odinger equation, the lost formulas are\nrecovered. The so-called difficulty of negative probability of Klein-Gordon\nequation for free particles is solved. A PKE (NKE) particle can have stationary\nmotion only when it is subject to an attractive (repulsive) potential, which is\ndetermined by Virial theorem. Two NKE electrons in a potential can constitute a\nstablesystem, a new kind of possible mechanism for electron paring. The whole\ndiscussion stems from RQMEs with no any new postulation. Experiments are\nsuggested, which may confirm that there are indeed NKE electrons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2020 23:49:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-13"}
