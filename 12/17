Second, a similar coincidence is observed for GCs and CGCs with\n$\\rm [X/H]<-1$ and $\\rm [X/H]> -1$ at redshifts $ 2 <z <3 $, where $[X/H]$ is\nthe metallicity determined from the sum of several elemental abundances (Dias\net al. 2016, Rafelski et al. 2012, Wotta et al. 2019, Quiret et al. 2016).\nThird, high-metallicity CGCs are observed starting from redshifts $\\rm z\\le\n2.5$, i.e. approximately 11 Gyrs ago. At the same time globular clusters were\nactively formed, and their supernovae were able to enrich the surrounding gas,\nfrom which the high-metal component of the clouds was formed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2020 16:23:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}

Unfortunately, datasets cannot capture the infinite variability of\nthe real world, thus neural networks are inherently limited by the restricted\nvisual and semantic information contained in their training set. In this\nthesis, we argue that it is crucial to design deep architectures that can\noperate in previously unseen visual domains and recognize novel semantic\nconcepts. In the first part of the thesis, we describe different solutions to\nenable deep models to generalize to new visual domains, by transferring\nknowledge from a labeled source domain(s) to a domain (target) where no labeled\ndata are available. We will show how variants of batch-normalization (BN) can\nbe applied to different scenarios, from domain adaptation when source and\ntarget are mixtures of multiple latent domains, to domain generalization,\ncontinuous domain adaptation, and predictive domain adaptation, where\ninformation about the target domain is available only in the form of metadata.\nIn the second part of the thesis, we show how to extend the knowledge of a\npretrained deep model to new semantic concepts, without access to the original\ntraining set. We address the scenarios of sequential multi-task learning, using\ntransformed task-specific binary masks, open-world recognition, with end-to-end\ntraining and enforced clustering, and incremental class learning in semantic\nsegmentation, where we highlight and address the problem of the semantic shift\nof the background class. In the final part, we tackle a more challenging\nproblem: given images of multiple domains and semantic categories (with their\nattributes), how to build a model that recognizes images of unseen concepts in\nunseen domains? We also propose an approach based on domain and semantic mixing\nof inputs and features, which is a first, promising step towards solving this\nproblem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2020 16:23:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-17"}

A particularly popular gate set in the literature on quantum\ncomputing consists of arbitrary single-qubit gates and 2-qubit CNOT gates. A\nCNOT gate is however not always the natural multi-qubit interaction that can be\nimplemented on a given physical quantum computer, necessitating a compilation\nstep that transforms these CNOT gates to the native gate set. A particularly\ninteresting case where compilation is necessary is for ion trap quantum\ncomputers, where the natural entangling operation can act on more than 2 qubits\nand can even act globally on all qubits at once. This calls for an entirely\ndifferent approach to constructing efficient circuits. In this paper we study\nthe problem of converting a given circuit that uses 2-qubit gates to one that\nuses global gates. Our three main contributions are as follows. First, we find\nan efficient algorithm for transforming an arbitrary circuit consisting of\nClifford gates and arbitrary phase gates into a circuit consisting of\nsingle-qubit gates and a number of global interactions proportional to the\nnumber of non-Clifford phases present in the original circuit. Second, we find\na general strategy to transform a global gate that targets all qubits into one\nthat targets only a subset of the qubits. This approach scales linearly with\nthe number of qubits that are not targeted, in contrast to the exponential\nscaling reported in (Maslov & Nam, N. J. Phys. 2018). Third, we improve on the\nnumber of global gates required to synthesise an arbitrary n-qubit Clifford\ncircuit from the 12n-18 reported in (Maslov & Nam, N. J. Phys. 2018) to 6n-8.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2020 16:29:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Mar 2021 11:32:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-05"}

Recently, convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs) have been shown to be adept at image analysis, and are\nbeginning to supersede traditional measurements of visual morphology and\nmodel-based structural parameters. In this work, we take a further step by\nextending CNNs to measure well known non-parametric structural quantities:\nconcentration ($C$) and asymmetry ($A$). We train CNNs to predict $C$ and $A$\nfrom individual images of $\\sim 150,000$ galaxies at $0 < z < 7$ in the CANDELS\nfields, using Bayesian hyperparameter optimisation to select suitable network\narchitectures. Our resulting networks accurately reproduce measurements\ncompared with standard algorithms.

While both approaches suffer from similar systematic biases\nwith redshift, these remain small out to $z \\sim 7$. Once trained, measurements\nwith our networks are $> 10^3$ times faster than previous methods.

To address the issues of mechanism\nheterogeneity and related data scarcity, we propose a data-efficient RL\nalgorithm that exploits structural causal models (SCMs) to model the state\ndynamics, which are estimated by leveraging both commonalities and differences\nacross subjects. The learned SCM enables us to counterfactually reason what\nwould have happened had another treatment been taken. It helps avoid real\n(possibly risky) exploration and mitigates the issue that limited experiences\nlead to biased policies. We propose counterfactual RL algorithms to learn both\npopulation-level and individual-level policies.

While prior work indicates\nthat mMIMO networks employing time division duplexing have a significant\ncapacity growth potential, deploying mMIMO in frequency division duplexing\n(FDD) networks remains problematic. The two main difficulties in FDD networks\nare the scalability of the downlink reference signals and the overhead\nassociated with the required uplink feedback for channel state information\n(CSI) acquisition. To address these difficulties, most existing methods utilize\nassumptions on the radio environment such as channel sparsity or angular\nreciprocity. In this work, we propose a novel cooperative method for a scalable\nand low-overhead approach to FDD mMIMO under the so-called grid-of-beams\narchitecture.

An agency's\nscoring function typically operates on a feature vector that contains a\ncombination of self-reported features and information available to the agency\nabout individuals or households.This can create incentives for agents to\nmisrepresent their self-reported features in order to receive resources or\navoid scrutiny, but agencies may be able to selectively audit agents to verify\nthe veracity of their reports.\n  We study the problem of optimal auditing of agents in such settings. When\ndecisions are made using a threshold on an agent's score, the optimal audit\npolicy has a surprisingly simple structure, uniformly auditing all agents who\ncould benefit from lying. While this policy can, in general, be hard to compute\nbecause of the difficulty of identifying the set of agents who could benefit\nfrom lying given a complete set of reported types, we also present necessary\nand sufficient conditions under which it is tractable.

However, due to their nanoscale\ndimension, they suffer more severe corrosion by the electrolyte solution than\nthe thin-film counterparts. Thus, short-term durability is the major obstacle\nfor using these NWs for practical water splitting applications. Here, we\ndemonstrated for the first time that a thin layer (~7 nm thick) of compact\nTiO$_2$ deposited by atomic layer deposition can provide robust protection to\nIII-V NWs. The protected GaAs NWs maintain 91.4% of its photoluminescence\nintensity after 14 months of storage in ambient atmosphere, which suggests the\nTiO$_2$ layer is pinhole-free. Working as a photocathode for water splitting,\nthey exhibited a 45% larger photocurrent density compared with un-protected\ncounterparts and a high Faraday efficiency of 91%, and can also maintain a\nrecord-long highly-stable performance among narrow-bandgap III-V NW\nphotoelectrodes; after 67 hours photoelectrochemical stability test reaction in\nstrong acid electrolyte solution (pH = 1), they show no apparent indication of\ncorrosion, which is in stark contrast to the un-protected NWs that are fully\nfailed after 35-hours.

In this work,\nwe explore the extent to which resolving and modeling individual galaxy\nformation histories affects predictions both for the galaxy populations\ndetectable by upcoming surveys and the signatures of reionization accessible to\nupcoming 21-cm experiments. We find that a common approach, in which galaxy\nluminosity is assumed to be a function of halo mass only, is biased with\nrespect to models in which galaxy properties are evolved through time via\nsemi-analytic modeling and thus reflective of the diversity of assembly\nhistories that naturally arise in $N$-body simulations. The diversity of galaxy\nformation histories also results in scenarios in which the brightest galaxies\ndo \\textit{not} always reside in the centers of large ionized regions, as there\nare often relatively low-mass halos undergoing dramatic, but short-term,\ngrowth.

A significant fraction of the predicted baryons remains undetected\nin the local universe. We adopted the common assumption that a large fraction\nof the missing baryons corresponds to the hot (log T(K) = 5.5-7) phase of the\nWarm Hot Intergalactic Medium (WHIM). We base our missing baryons search on the\nscenario whereby the WHIM has been heated up via accretion shocks and galactic\noutflows, and is concentrated towards the filaments of the Cosmic Web.\n  Aims. Our aim is to improve the observational search of the poorly detected\nhot WHIM.\n  Methods. We detect the filamentary structure within the EAGLE simulation by\napplying the Bisous formalism to the galaxy distribution. In addition, we use\nthe MMF/NEXUS+ classification of the large scale environment of the dark matter\ncomponent in EAGLE. We then study the spatio-thermal distribution of the hot\nbaryons within the extracted filaments.\n  Results. While the filaments occupy only 5% of the full simulation volume,\nthe diffuse hot intergalactic medium in filaments amounts to 23% $-$ 25% of the\ntotal baryon budget, or 79% $-$ 87% of all the hot WHIM. The most optimal\nfilament sample, with a missing baryon mass fraction of 82%, is obtained by\nselecting Bisous filaments with a high galaxy luminosity density.

Characterizing the origin of asymmetries\nas seen in HD 163296 might lead to a better understanding of planet formation\nand the underlying physical parameters of the system. We test the possibility\nof the formation of the crescent-shaped asymmetry in the HD 163296 disk through\nplanet-disk interaction. The goal is to obtain constraints on planet masses and\neccentricities and disk viscosities. Two dimensional, multi-fluid,\nhydrodynamical simulations are performed with the FARGO3D code including three\nembedded planets. Dust is described with the pressureless fluid approach and is\ndistributed over eight size bins. Resulting grids are post-processed with the\nradiative transfer code RADMC-3D and the CASA software to model synthetic\nobservations. We find that the crescent-shaped asymmetry can be qualitatively\nmodeled with a Jupiter mass planet at a radial distance of 48 au. Dust is\ntrapped preferably in the trailing Lagrange point L5 with a mass of 10 to 15\nearth masses. Increased values of eccentricity of the innermost Jupiter mass\nplanet damages the stability of the crescent-shaped feature and does not\nreproduce the observed radial proximity to the first prominent ring in the\nsystem.

The use of drone-mounted\nBS (UxNB) is a solution in places where UEs are densely populated, such as\nstadiums. UxNB emerges as a promising technology that can be used for capacity\ninjection purposes in the future due to its fast deployment. However, this\nemerging technology introduces a new security issue. Mutual authentication,\ncreating a communication channel between terrestrial BS and UxNB, and fast\nhandover operations may cause security issues in the use of UxNB for capacity\ninjection. This new protocol also suggests performing UE handover from\nterrestrial to UxNB as a group. To the best of the authors' knowledge, there is\nno authentication solution between BSs according to LTE and 5G standards. The\nproposed scheme provides a solution for the authentication of UxNB by the\nterrestrial BS.

In this paper, we propose a new NUM framework,\nLearning-NUM, where the users' utility functions are unknown apriori and the\nutility function values of the traffic rates can be observed only after the\ncorresponding traffic is delivered to the destination, which means that the\nutility feedback experiences \\textit{queueing delay}.\n  The goal is to design a policy that gradually learns the utility functions\nand makes rate allocation and network scheduling/routing decisions so as to\nmaximize the total utility obtained over a finite time horizon $T$. In addition\nto unknown utility functions and stochastic constraints, a central challenge of\nour problem lies in the queueing delay of the observations, which may be\nunbounded and depends on the decisions of the policy.\n  We first show that the expected total utility obtained by the best dynamic\npolicy is upper bounded by the solution to a static optimization problem.\nWithout the presence of feedback delay, we design an algorithm based on the\nideas of gradient estimation and Max-Weight scheduling. To handle the feedback\ndelay, we embed the algorithm in a parallel-instance paradigm to form a policy\nthat achieves $\\tilde{O}(T^{3/4})$-regret, i.e., the difference between the\nexpected utility obtained by the best dynamic policy and our policy is in\n$\\tilde{O}(T^{3/4})$. Finally, to demonstrate the practical applicability of\nthe Learning-NUM framework, we apply it to three application scenarios\nincluding database query, job scheduling and video streaming. We further\nconduct simulations on the job scheduling application to evaluate the empirical\nperformance of our policy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2020 19:36:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-18"}

The net modal gain of these CQWs reaches 530 cm-1 for the green and\n201 cm-1 for the red, two orders of magnitude larger than those of colloidal\nquantum dots (QDs) in solution owing to intrinsically larger gain\ncross-sections of these CQWs. To explain the root cause for ultrahigh gain\ncoefficient in solution, we show that for the first time that the gain\ncross-sections of these CQWs is 3.3x10-14 cm2 in the green and 1.3x10-14 cm2 in\nthe red which are two orders magnitude larger compared to those of CQDs. These\nfindings confirm the extraordinary prospects of these solution-processed CQWs\nas solution-based optical gain media in lasing applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2020 20:05:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-18"}

Prior attempts on\nthe challenging Semantic Scene Completion task - which entails the inference of\ndense 3D structure and associated semantic labels from \"sparse\" representations\n- have been, to a degree, successful in small indoor scenes when provided with\ndense point clouds or dense depth maps often fused with semantic segmentation\nmaps from RGB images.

This algorithm can be\nimplemented on parallel computers so that there is little increase in\ncomputation time (compared to linear increase) as the number of dimensions\nincreases. The time complexity of O(n) is achieved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2020 20:37:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-18"}

A popular approach to do this is\ncalled model reconciliation, where the agent tries to reconcile the differences\nin its model and the human's model such that the plan is also optimal in the\nhuman's model. In this paper, we present a logic-based framework for model\nreconciliation that extends beyond the realm of planning. More specifically,\ngiven a knowledge base $KB_1$ entailing a formula $\\varphi$ and a second\nknowledge base $KB_2$ not entailing it, model reconciliation seeks an\nexplanation, in the form of a cardinality-minimal subset of $KB_1$, whose\nintegration into $KB_2$ makes the entailment possible. Our approach, based on\nideas originating in the context of analysis of inconsistencies, exploits the\nexisting hitting set duality between minimal correction sets (MCSes) and\nminimal unsatisfiable sets (MUSes) in order to identify an appropriate\nexplanation. However, differently from those works targeting inconsistent\nformulas, which assume a single knowledge base, MCSes and MUSes are computed\nover two distinct knowledge bases.

By measuring the Time-Of-Flight (TOF)\nbetween a beam monitor placed upstream and the Prompt-Gamma (PG) detector, our\ngoal is to reconstruct the PG vertex distribution to detect a possible\ndeviation of proton beam delivery. In this paper, two non-iterative\nreconstruction strategies are proposed. The first is based on the resolution of\nan analytical formula describing the PG vertex distribution in 3D. Here, it was\nresolved under a one-dimensional approximation in order to measure a potential\nproton range shift along the beam direction. The second is based on the\ncalculation of the Centre-Of-Gravity (COG) of the TIARA pixel detectors counts\nand also provides 3D information on a possible beam displacement. The PG vertex\nreconstruction was evaluated in two different scenarios. A coincidence time\nresolution of 100 ps (rms) can be attained in single proton regime (operating a\nreduction of the beam current) and using an external beam monitor to provide a\nstart trigger for the TOF measurement. Under these conditions, MC simulations\nhave shown that a millimetric proton range shift sensitivity can be achieved at\n2$\\sigma$ with 10$^{8}$ incident protons. This level of accuracy would allow to\nact in real-time if the treatment does not conform to treatment plan. A worst\ncase scenario of a 1 ns (rms) TOF resolution was also considered to demonstrate\nthat a degraded timing information can be compensated by increasing the\nacquisition statistics: in this case, a 2 mm range shift would be detectable at\n2$\\sigma$ with 10$^{9}$ incident protons. The COG method has shown excellent\ncapabilities of detecting lateral beam displacements: a 2 mm sensitivity was\nfound at 2$\\sigma$ with 10$^{8}$ incident protons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2020 21:27:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-11"}

Deep convolutional neural nets (CNNs) have\nshown great promise in achieving clinically applicable image segmentation\nperformance on CT or MRI images. State-of-the-art CNN segmentation models apply\neither 2D or 3D convolutions on input images, with pros and cons associated\nwith each method: 2D convolution is fast, less memory-intensive but inadequate\nfor extracting 3D contextual information from volumetric images, while the\nopposite is true for 3D convolution.

The result is an unprecedented\nrecord of Saturn's climate that spans almost half a Saturnian year, which can\nbe used to test the seasonal predictions of radiative climate models, neutral\nand ion photochemistry models, and atmospheric circulation models. Hemispheric\nasymmetries in tropospheric and stratospheric temperatures were observed to\nreverse from northern winter to northern summer; spatial distributions of\nhydrocarbons and para-hydrogen shifted in response to atmospheric dynamics\n(e.g., seasonally-reversing Hadley cells, polar stratospheric vortex formation,\nequatorial stratospheric oscillations, and inter-hemispheric transport); and\nupper tropospheric and stratospheric aerosols exhibited changes in optical\nthickness that modulated Saturn's visible colours (from blue hues to a golden\nappearance in the north near solstice), reflectivity, and near-infrared\nemission. Numerical simulations of radiative balance and photochemistry do a\ngood job in reproducing the observed seasonal change and phase lags, but\ndiscrepancies between models and observations still persist, indicating a\ncrucial role for atmospheric dynamics and the need to couple chemical and\nradiative schemes to the next generation of circulation models.

Unlike previous\nmethods that either requires the sketch-image pairs or utilize low-quantity\ndetected edges as sketches, we study the exemplar-based sketch-to-image (s2i)\nsynthesis task in a self-supervised learning manner, eliminating the necessity\nof the paired sketch data. To this end, we first propose an unsupervised method\nto efficiently synthesize line-sketches for general RGB-only datasets. With the\nsynthetic paired-data, we then present a self-supervised Auto-Encoder (AE) to\ndecouple the content/style features from sketches and RGB-images, and\nsynthesize images that are both content-faithful to the sketches and\nstyle-consistent to the RGB-images. While prior works employ either the\ncycle-consistence loss or dedicated attentional modules to enforce the\ncontent/style fidelity, we show AE's superior performance with pure\nself-supervisions. To further improve the synthesis quality in high resolution,\nwe also leverage an adversarial network to refine the details of synthetic\nimages. Extensive experiments on 1024*1024 resolution demonstrate a new\nstate-of-art-art performance of the proposed model on CelebA-HQ and Wiki-Art\ndatasets.

SOTs generated from the in-plane spin\npolarization along y-axis originated by the spin Hall and Edelstein effects can\nswitch magnetization collinear with the spin polarization in the absence of\nexternal magnetic fields. However, an external magnetic field is required to\nswitch the magnetization along x and z-axes via SOT generated by y-spin\npolarization. Here, we present that the above limitation can be circumvented by\nunconventional SOT in magnetron-sputtered thin film MnPd3. In addition to the\nconventional in-plane anti-damping-like torque due to the y-spin polarization,\nout-of-plane and in-plane anti-damping-like torques originating from z-spin and\nx-spin polarizations, respectively have been observed at room temperature. The\nspin torque efficiency corresponding to the y-spin polarization from MnPd3 thin\nfilms grown on thermally oxidized silicon substrate and post annealed at 400\nDeg C is 0.34 - 0.44.

However, this explains little about\nthe dramatic drop in coercivity in FeNi alloys at a non-zero anisotropy value.\nHere, we develop a theoretical and computational tool to investigate the\nfundamental interplay between material constants that govern coercivity in bulk\nmagnetic alloys. The two distinguishing features of our coercivity tool are\nthat: (a) we introduce a large localized disturbance, such as a spike-like\nmagnetic domain, that provides a nucleation barrier for magnetization reversal;\nand (b) we account for magneto-elastic energy -- however small -- in addition\nto the anisotropy and magnetostatic energy terms. We apply this coercivity tool\nto show that the interactions between local instabilities and material\nconstants, such as anisotropy and magnetostriction constants, are key factors\nthat govern magnetic coercivity in bulk alloys.

This effect has been known for decades, observed theoretically and\nexperimentally via one-dimensional and two-dimensional structures commonly\nknown as resonant gratings, metamaterials, and metasurfaces. The physical cause\nof this extraordinary phenomenon is guided-mode resonance mediated by lateral\nBloch modes excited by evanescent diffraction orders in the subwavelength\nregime. In recent years, hundreds of papers have declared Fabry-Perot or Mie\nresonance to be basis of the perfect reflection possessed by periodic\nmetasurfaces. Treating a simple one-dimensional cylindrical-rod lattice, here\nwe show clearly and unambiguously that Mie resonance does not cause perfect\nreflection. In fact, the spectral placement of the Bloch-mode-mediated\nzero-order reflectance is primarily controlled by the lattice period by way of\nits direct effect on the homogenized effective-medium refractive index of the\nlattice. In general, perfect reflection appears away from Mie resonance.\nHowever, when the lateral leaky-mode field profiles approach the\nisolated-particle Mie field profiles, the resonance locus tends towards the Mie\nresonance wavelength. The fact that the lattice fields remember the isolated\nparticle fields is referred here as Mie modal memory. On erasure of the Mie\nmemory by an index-matched sublayer, we show that perfect reflection survives\nwith the resonance locus approaching the homogenized effective-medium waveguide\nlocus. The results presented here will aid in clarifying the physical basis of\ngeneral resonant photonic lattices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2020 23:37:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-01"}

FELs can produce a variety of different\noptical polarizations of the output radiation ranging from linear through\nelliptic to circular polarization depending upon the characteristics of the\nundulators used. For example, x-ray FELs use long undulator lines composed of a\nseries of relatively short undulators. Most such FELs use linearly polarized\nundulators due to the ease of manufacture and tuning; hence the optical output\nis linearly polarized. However, elliptic or circular polarizations are possible\nby varying the orientation of the undulators along the line. Alternately,\nAPPLE-II or Delta undulator designs allow for producing undulating magnetic\nfields with arbitrary polarizations. Here, we present a three-dimensional,\ntime-dependent formulation that self-consistently models two independent\noptical polarizations and, therefore, completely treats any given sequence or\ncombination of undulator, undulator imperfections, and undulator degradation\nThere are two principal characteristics of the formulation that underpin this\ncapability. In the first place, the particle trajectories are integrated by\nmeans of the full Lorentz force equations using three-dimensional analytic\nmodels of the undulators fields. This permits an accurate model of the\ninteraction of the electrons with a large variety of undulator fields and\norientations. In the second place, the formulation allows the electrons to\ncouple simultaneously to two independent polarizations of the electromagnetic\nwave and, therefore, allows the optical polarization to evolve\nself-consistently along the undulator line. After first describing the\nnumerical model, we proceed to give some examples using different undulator\nconfigurations that are of interest.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2020 00:56:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-18"}

However, there is limited fast-charging\ninfrastructure in most parts of the world to support EV travel, especially\nlong-distance trips. The goal of this study is to develop a stochastic dynamic\nsimulation modeling framework of a regional system of EV fast-charging stations\nfor real-time management and strategic planning (i.e., capacity allocation)\npurposes. To model EV user behavior, specifically fast-charging station\nchoices, the framework incorporates a multinomial logit station choice model\nthat considers charging prices, expected wait times, and detour distances. To\ncapture the dynamics of supply and demand at each fast-charging station, the\nframework incorporates a multi-server queueing model in the simulation. The\nstudy assumes that multiple fast-charging stations are managed by a single\nentity and that the demand for these stations are interrelated. To manage the\nsystem of stations, the study proposes and tests dynamic demand-responsive\nprice adjustment (DDRPA) schemes based on station queue lengths. The study\napplies the modeling framework to a system of EV fast-charging stations in\nSouthern California. The results indicate that DDRPA strategies are an\neffective mechanism to balance charging demand across fast-charging stations.\nSpecifically, compared to the no DDRPA scheme case, the quadratic DDRPA scheme\nreduces average wait time by 26%, increases charging station revenue (and user\ncosts) by 5.8%, while, most importantly, increasing social welfare by 2.7% in\nthe base scenario. Moreover, the study also illustrates that the modeling\nframework can evaluate the allocation of EV fast-charging station capacity, to\nidentify stations that require additional chargers and areas that would benefit\nfrom additional fast-charging stations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2020 01:41:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-18"}

Our\narchitecture builds on the basic BERT model with three specific components for\nreranking: (a). document-query matching (b). keyword extraction and (c).\nfacet-conditioned abstractive summarization. The outcomes of (b) and (c) are\nused to essentially transform a candidate document into a concise summary that\ncan be compared with the query at hand to compute a relevance score.

Under appropriate management of EV charging and\ndischarging, the grid can currently satisfy the energy requirements of a\nconsiderable number of EVs. Furthermore, EVs can help enhance the reliability\nand stability of the energy grid through ancillary services such as energy\nstorage. This paper proposes the EV routing problem with time windows under\ntime-variant electricity prices (EVRPTW-TP) which optimizes the routing of an\nEV fleet that are delivering products to customers, jointly with the scheduling\nof the charging and discharging of the EVs from/to the grid. The proposed model\nis a multiperiod vehicle routing problem where EVs can stop at charging\nstations to either recharge their batteries or inject stored energy to the\ngrid. Given the energy costs that vary based on time-of-use, the charging and\ndischarging schedules of the EVs are optimized to benefit from the capability\nof storing energy by shifting energy demands from peak hours to off-peak hours\nwhen the energy price is lower. The vehicles can recover the energy costs and\npotentially realize profits by injecting energy back to the grid at high price\nperiods. EVRPTW-TP is formulated as an optimization problem. A Lagrangian\nrelaxation approach and a hybrid variable neighborhood search/tabu search\nheuristic are proposed to obtain high quality lower bounds and feasible\nsolutions, respectively.

Moreover, considering the insulating nature of TmIG,\nour results cannot be explained by the SOT mechanism established for metallic\nmagnets where the transverse charge spin current can inject and dephase in the\nmagnetic layers. Rather we can explain this non-monotonic behavior by a model\nbased on the interfacial spin mixing conductance that is affected by the\nthickness-dependent exchange splitting energy by determining the phase\ndifference of the reflected spin-up and spin-down electrons at the TmIG / Pt\ninterface. By studying the Pt thickness dependence, we find that the effective\nDMI for GGG / TmIG / Pt does not depend on the Pt thickness, which indicates\nthat the GGG / TmIG interface is the source of the iDMI in this system.

We also found that across all topics, negative sentiment among\nstudents post COVID-19 was much higher compared to pre-COVID-19. We expect our\nstudy to have an impact on policy-makers in higher education across several\nspectra, including college administrators, teachers, parents, and mental health\ncounselors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2020 02:46:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-18"}

In this paper, we propose a Semi-Global Shape-aware\nNetwork (SGSNet) considering both feature similarity and proximity for\npreserving object shapes when modeling long-range dependencies. A hierarchical\nway is taken to aggregate global context.

However, an effective DCT must not only preserve\nuser privacy but also augment the existing manual contact tracing process.\nIndeed, not every member of a population may own a cell phone or have a DCT app\ninstalled and enabled.

Designing a general OoD generalization framework to\na wide range of applications is challenging, mainly due to possible correlation\nshift and diversity shift in the real world. Most of the previous approaches\ncan only solve one specific distribution shift, such as shift across domains or\nthe extrapolation of correlation. To address that, we propose DecAug, a novel\ndecomposed feature representation and semantic augmentation approach for OoD\ngeneralization.

Furthermore, we perform gradient-based augmentation on context-related\nfeatures to improve the robustness of the learned representations.

Typically, defense is performed on the entire\nadversarial example, both image and perturbation are modified, making it\ndifficult to tell how it defends against the perturbations. To evaluate the\nrobustness of these denoising strategies intuitively, we directly apply them to\ndefend against adversarial noise itself (assuming we have obtained all of it),\nwhich saving us from sacrificing benign accuracy.

In this\nwork, we directly estimate the unwindowed power spectrum multipoles using\nquadratic estimators akin to those introduced in the late 1990s. Under Gaussian\nassumptions, these are optimal and free from the leading-order effects of\npixellization and non-Poissonian shot-noise. They may be straightforwardly\ncomputed given the survey data-set and a suite of simulations of known\ncosmology. We implement the pixel-based maximum-likelihood estimator and a\nsimplification based on the FKP weighting scheme, both of which can be computed\nvia FFTs and conjugate gradient descent methods. Furthermore, the estimators\nallow direct computation of spectrum coefficients in an arbitrary linear\ncompression scheme, without needing to first bin the statistic. Applying the\ntechnique to a subset of the BOSS DR12 galaxies, we find that the pixel-based\nquadratic estimators give statistically consistent power spectra, compressed\ncoefficients, and cosmological parameters to those obtained with the usual\nwindowed approaches. Due to the sample's low number density and compact window\nfunction, the optimal weighting scheme gives little improvement over the\nsimplified form; this may change for dense surveys or those focusing on\nprimordial non-Gaussianity. The technique is shown to be efficient and robust,\nand shows significant potential for measuring the windowless power spectrum and\nbispectrum in the presence of weak non-Gaussianity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2020 04:43:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Apr 2021 23:07:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-12"}

However, the reliability of the\nfine-tuned text classifiers is an often underlooked performance criterion. For\ninstance, one may desire a model that can detect out-of-distribution (OOD)\nsamples (drawn far from training distribution) or be robust against domain\nshifts. We claim that one central obstacle to the reliability is the\nover-reliance of the model on a limited number of keywords, instead of looking\nat the whole context. In particular, we find that (a) OOD samples often contain\nin-distribution keywords, while (b) cross-domain samples may not always contain\nkeywords; over-relying on the keywords can be problematic for both cases. In\nlight of this observation, we propose a simple yet effective fine-tuning\nmethod, coined masked keyword regularization (MASKER), that facilitates\ncontext-based prediction. MASKER regularizes the model to reconstruct the\nkeywords from the rest of the words and make low-confidence predictions without\nenough context. When applied to various pre-trained language models (e.g.,\nBERT, RoBERTa, and ALBERT), we demonstrate that MASKER improves OOD detection\nand cross-domain generalization without degrading classification accuracy.

We used\nco-observations from the AIA and HMI/SDO, together with data from the Fast\nImaging Solar Spectrograph taken in the Halpha and Ca II 8542 lines. We used a\nnew multi-layer spectral inversion technique to derive the temporal variations\nof the temperature of the Halpha loops (HLs). We find that the counterpart of\nthe CBP, as seen at chromospheric temperatures, is composed of a bundle of dark\nelongated features named in this work Halpha loops, which constitute an\nintegral part of the CBP loop magnetic structure. An increase in the\nphotospheric magnetic flux due to flux emergence is accompanied by a rise of\nthe coronal emission of the CBP loops, that is a heating episode. We also\nobserve enhanced chromospheric activity associated with the occurrence of new\nHLs and mottles. While the coronal emission and magnetic flux increases appear\nto be co-temporal, the response of the Halpha counterpart of the CBP occurs\nwith a small delay of less than 3 min. A sharp temperature increase is found in\none of the HLs and in one of the CBP footpoints estimated at 46% and 55% with\nrespect to the pre-event values, also starting with a delay of less than 3~min\nfollowing the coronal heating episode. The low-lying CBP loop structure remains\nnon-potential for the entire observing period. The magnetic topological\nanalysis of the overlying corona reveals the presence of a coronal null point\nat the beginning and towards the end of the heating episode. The delay in the\nresponse of the chromospheric counterpart of the CBP suggests that the heating\nmay have occurred at coronal heights.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2020 07:34:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2020 18:02:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-17"}

Owing to the flexible representation of GP, a new\nknowledge sharing mechanism based on a new individual representation is\ndeveloped to allow GP to automatically learn what to share across two tasks and\nto improve its learning performance. The shared knowledge is encoded as a\ncommon tree, which can represent the common/general features of two tasks. With\nthe new individual representation, each task is solved using the features\nextracted from a common tree and a task-specific tree representing\ntask-specific features. To learn the best common and task-specific trees, a new\nevolutionary process and new fitness functions are developed. The performance\nof the proposed approach is examined on six multitask problems of 12 image\nclassification datasets with limited training data and compared with three GP\nand 14 non-GP-based competitive methods. Experimental results show that the new\napproach outperforms these compared methods in almost all the comparisons.\nFurther analysis reveals that the new approach learns simple yet effective\ncommon trees with high effectiveness and transferability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2020 08:34:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2020 20:51:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-16"}

Among the various\npartition strategies, edge partition has demonstrated more promising\nperformance in power-law graphs than vertex partition and thereby has been more\nwidely adopted as the default partition strategy by existing graph systems. The\ngraph edge partition problem, which is to split the edge set into multiple\nbalanced parts to minimize the total number of copied vertices, has been widely\nstudied from the view of optimization and algorithms. In this paper, we study\nlocal search algorithms for this problem to further improve the partition\nresults from existing methods.

Based on these, we develop a\ngreedy heuristic as well as an improved search algorithm utilizing the property\nof the max-flow model. To evaluate the performance of our algorithms, we first\nprovide adequate theoretical analysis in terms of the approximation quality. We\nsignificantly improve the previously known approximation ratio for this\nproblem.

The differences are severe enough to clutter the analysis of Juno's\ndata and even cast doubts on the usefulness of these computationally expensive\nEOSs for the modeling of the interior of Jupiter and exoplanets at large.

Here, we\nconstruct an analogous treatment for an active rubber fibre actuated via an\naxisymmetric pattern of spontaneous distortion. We start by constructing an\nexact large-deformation solution to the equations of elasticity for such fibre\nsubject to imposed twist and stretch, which reveals spontaneous warping and\ntwisting of the fibre cross-section absent in passive rubbers. We then compute\nthe corresponding non-linear elastic energy, which encompasses the Poynting\neffect, but is minimized by a finite spontaneous twist and stretch. In the\nsecond half of the paper, we apply these results to understand the\ntwist-contraction actuation of nematic elastomer fibres fabricated with\ndirector-fields that encode helical patterns of contraction on heating. We\nfirst consider patterns making a constant angle with respect to the local\ncylindrical coordinate system (conical spiral director curves) and verify the\npredicted spontaneous twist, contraction and cross-section deformation via\nfinite elements. Secondly, we consider realistic director distributions for the\nexperimentally reported fibres fabricated by cross-linking while simultaneously\napplying stretch and twist. Counter-intuitively, we find that maximum actuation\ntwist is produced by applying a finite optimal twist during fabrication.\nFinally, we illustrate that spontaneously twisting fibres will coil into\nspring-like shapes on actuation if the ends are prevented from twisting\nrelative to each other. Such twist-torsion coupling would allow to make a\ntendril-like \"soft-spring\" actuator with low force and high linear stroke\ncompared to the intrinsic contraction of the elastomer itself.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2020 09:32:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Mar 2021 09:24:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-29"}

Our theory relies\non a mapping from the optical non-Hermitian coupling matrix to an effective\ntopological insulator Hamiltonian. This mapping is based on the singular value\ndecomposition of non-Hermitian coupling matrices, whose inverse matrix\ndetermines the linear input-output response of the system. In topologically\nnon-trivial regimes, the input-output response of the lattice is dominated by\nsingular vectors with zero singular values that are the equivalent of\nzero-energy states in topological insulators, leading to directional\namplification of a coherent input signal. In such topological amplification\nregime, our theoretical framework allows us to fully characterize the\namplification properties of the quantum device such as gain, bandwidth, added\nnoise, and noise-to-signal ratio. We exemplify our ideas in a one-dimensional\nnon-reciprocal photonic lattice, for which we derive fully analytical\npredictions.

Experimental tests are of\nparamount importance for improving the current comprehension and validate\nexisting models. However, experiments involving blast scenarios are, at\npresent, partial and limited in number, compared to tests under different\ndynamic conditions, such as earthquakes. The reason lies on the fact that\nfull-scale blast experiments present many difficulties, mainly due to the\nnature of the loading action. Experiments in reduced-scale offer instead\ngreater flexibility. Nevertheless, appropriate scaling laws for the response of\nmasonry structures under blast excitations are needed before performing such\ntests. We propose here new scaling laws for the dynamic, rigid-body response\nand failure modes of masonry structures under blast loads.

Via evaluation of the\nmaximum Lyapunov exponent of orbits of particles launched from the equatorial\nplane with an axial velocity (the angular velocity sets the length and energy\nscales of the system), we found prominent regions of quasi-periodic orbits\naround stable periodic orbits in the equatorial plane at high-energies.\nParticles in these orbits oscillate around the equatorial plane and their\nradial distance from the dipole can vary by a factor of/,2. Relativistic\nelectrons in such orbits may be responsible for the almost 100% polarized\nemission from FRB 121102.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2020 10:41:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-10"}

The benefits of our method are\nillustrated by the principle of multi-task learning (MTL), i.e., by separating\nless-related joints into different groups (as different tasks), our method\nlearns different features for each of them, therefore efficiently avoids the\nnegative transfer (among less related tasks/groups of joints). The key of our\nmethod is a novel binary selector that automatically selects related joints\ninto the same group. We implement such a selector with binary values\nstochastically sampled from a Concrete distribution, which is constructed using\nGumbel softmax on trainable parameters. This enables us to preserve the\ndifferentiable property of the whole network. We further exploit features from\nthose less-related groups by carrying out an additional feature fusing scheme\namong them, to learn more discriminative features. This is realized by\nimplementing multiple 1x1 convolutions on the concatenated features, where each\njoint group contains a unique 1x1 convolution for feature fusion. The detailed\nablation analysis and the extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate the promising performance of the proposed method over the\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Luckily, medical AEs are also easy to detect in hierarchical feature\nspace per our study herein. To better understand this phenomenon, we thoroughly\ninvestigate the intrinsic characteristic of medical AEs in feature space,\nproviding both empirical evidence and theoretical explanations for the\nquestion: why are medical adversarial attacks easy to detect? We first perform\na stress test to reveal the vulnerability of deep representations of medical\nimages, in contrast to natural images. We then theoretically prove that typical\nadversarial attacks to binary disease diagnosis network manipulate the\nprediction by continuously optimizing the vulnerable representations in a fixed\ndirection, resulting in outlier features that make medical AEs easy to detect.\nHowever, this vulnerability can also be exploited to hide the AEs in the\nfeature space. We propose a novel hierarchical feature constraint (HFC) as an\nadd-on to existing adversarial attacks, which encourages the hiding of the\nadversarial representation within the normal feature distribution. We evaluate\nthe proposed method on two public medical image datasets, namely {Fundoscopy}\nand {Chest X-Ray}. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our\nadversarial attack method as it bypasses an array of state-of-the-art\nadversarial detectors more easily than competing attack methods, supporting\nthat the great vulnerability of medical features allows an attacker more room\nto manipulate the adversarial representations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2020 11:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 May 2021 03:05:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-31"}

Meanwhile, the clusterzymes each demonstrate preferential\nenzyme-mimicking catalytic activities with compelling selectivity: Au25\nexhibits superior glutathione peroxidase-like (GPx-like) activity; Au24Cu1\nshows a distinct advantage towards catalase-like (CAT-like) activity by its Cu\nsingle active site; Au24Cd1 preferably acts as a superoxide dismutase-like\n(SOD-like) enzyme via the Cd single active site. This unique diversified\ncatalytic landscape manifests distinctive reactions against inflammation in\nbrain. Au24Cu1 behaves as an endogenous multi-enzyme mimic that directly\ndecreases peroxide in injured brain via catalytic reactions, while Au24Cd1,\ncatalyzes superoxide and nitrogenous signal molecules by preference, and\nsignificantly decreases inflammation factors such as IL-1\\b{eta}, IL-6, and\nTNF{\\alpha}, indicative of an important role in mitigating neuroinflammation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2020 11:51:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-18"}

An attractive design of spin injectors\ninto semiconductors is based on a spin pumping from a precessing ferromagnet,\ntypically excited by a microwave magnetic field leading to a high power\nconsumption of the device. Here we describe theoretically a spin injector with\ngreatly reduced energy losses, in which the magnetic dynamics is excited by an\nelastic wave injected into a ferromagnet-semiconductor heterostructure. To\ndemonstrate the efficient functioning of such an injector, we perform\nmicromagnetoelastic simulations of the coupled elastic and magnetic dynamics in\nNi films and Ni/GaAs bilayers. For thick Ni films, it is shown that a\nmonochromatic acoustic wave generates a spin wave with the same frequency and\nwavelength, which propagates over distances of several micrometers at the\nexcitation frequencies close to the frequency of ferromagnetic resonance. The\nsimulations of Ni/GaAs bilayers with Ni thicknesses comparable to the\nwavelength of the injected acoustic wave demonstrate the development of a\nsteady-state magnetization precession at the Ni/GaAs interface. The amplitude\nof such a precession has a maximum at Ni thickness amounting to three quarters\nof the wavelength of the elastic wave, which is explained by an analytical\nmodel. Using simulation data obtained for the magnetization precession at the\nNi/GaAs interface, we evaluate the spin current pumped into GaAs and calculate\nthe spin accumulation in it by solving the spin diffusion equation. Then the\nelectrical signals resulting from the spin flow and the inverse spin Hall\neffect are determined via the numerical solution of the Laplace's equation. It\nis shown that amplitudes of these ac signals are large enough for experimental\nmeasurement, which indicates an efficient acoustically driven spin pumping into\nGaAs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2020 12:03:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-12"}

There are few in\nsitu observations of 2D velocity fields in the marginal ice zone. Particle\ntracking velocimetry and particle image velocimetry are well known laboratory\ntechniques for measuring 2D velocity fields, but they usually rely on fragile\nequipment and pollutive plastic tracers. Therefore, in order to bring these\nmethods to the field, we have developed a new system which combines a compact\nopen-source remotely operated vehicle as an imaging device, and air bubbles as\ntracing particles. The data obtained can then be analyzed using image\nprocessing techniques tuned for field measurements in the polar regions. The\nproperties of the generated bubbles, such as the relation between terminal\nvelocity and diameter, have been investigated under controlled conditions. The\naccuracy and the spread of the velocity measurements have been quantified in a\nwave tank and compared with theoretical solutions. Horizontal velocity\ncomponents under periodic waves were measured within the order of 10% accuracy.\nThe deviation from theoretical solutions is attributed to the bubble inertia\ndue to the accelerated flow. We include an example from an Arctic field\nexpedition where the system was deployed and successfully tested from an ice\nfloe. This work is an important milestone towards performing detailed 2D flow\nmeasurements under the ice in the Arctic, which we anticipate will help perform\nmuch needed direct observations of the dynamics happening under sea ice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2020 12:41:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-26"}

The latter typically\nfollows from a strongly simplified, unidirectional shear flow under a constant\nstress assumption. We first derive the adjoint companion of the simplified\nmomentum equation, while distinguishing between two strategies. Using\nmixing-length arguments, we demonstrate that the frozen turbulence strategy and\na LoW-consistent (differentiated) approach provide virtually the same adjoint\nmomentum equations, that differ only in a single scalar coefficient controlling\nthe inclination in the logarithmic region. Moreover, it is seen that an adjoint\nLoW can be derived which resembles its primal counterpart in many aspects. The\nstrategy is also compatible with wall-function assumptions for prominent\nRANS-type two-equation turbulence models, which ground on the mixing-length\nhypothesis. As a direct consequence of the frequently employed assumption that\nall primal flow properties algebraically scale with the friction velocity, it\nis demonstrated that a simple algebraic expression provides a consistent\nclosure of the adjoint momentum equation in the logarithmic layer. This\nalgebraic adjoint closure might also serve as an approximation for more general\nadjoint flow optimization studies using standard one- or two-equation\nBoussinesq-viscosity models for the primal flow. Results obtained from the\nsuggested algebraic closure are verified against the primal/adjoint LoW\nformulations for both, low- and high-Re settings. Applications included in this\npaper refer to two- and three-dimensional shape optimizations of internal and\nexternal engineering flows.

This\nshows in particular that the minimal variance price is free from arbitrage.\n  -Then for the general case we apply a suitable maximum principle of optimal\nstochastic control to relate the minimal variance price z^=p_{mv}(F) to the\nHamiltonian and its adjoint processes, and we show that, under some conditions,\nz^=E_{Q_0}[F] for any Q_0 in a family M_0 of EMMs, described by the set of\nsolutions of a system of linear equations.\n  -Finally, we illustrate our results by looking at specific examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2020 13:36:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Feb 2021 11:34:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 27 Apr 2021 12:14:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-28"}

In fact, one may not even see rates proportional to the polynomial order\n$p > 1$ when the exact solution is a constant function. We show that the\nconvergence rate is limited by the regularity of an extraneous Lagrange\nmultiplier variable which naturally appears via a saddle-point analysis. In\nturn, limited convergence rates appear because the regularity of this Lagrange\nmultiplier is determined, in part, by the geometry of the domain. Numerical\nexperiments support our conclusions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2020 14:07:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2020 23:34:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 30 Aug 2021 17:21:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-31"}

This has to be taken into\naccount when interpreting models estimated from such measurements. For that\nreason, a measurement sensitivity analysis and determining the depth of\ninvestigation are standard steps during geophysical data processing. In\ndeterministic gradient-based inversion, the most used sensitivity measure, the\ndifferential sensitivity, is readily available since these inversions require\nthe computation of Jacobian matrices. In contrast, differential sensitivity may\nnot be readily available in Monte Carlo inversion methods, since these methods\ndo not necessarily include a linearization of the forward problem. Instead, a\nprior ensemble is used to simulate an ensemble of forward responses. Then, the\nprior ensemble is updated according to Bayesian inference. We propose to use\nthe covariance between the prior ensemble and the forward response ensemble for\nconstructing sensitivity measures. In Monte Carlo approaches, the estimation of\nthis covariance does not require additional computations of the forward model.\nNormalizing this covariance by the variance of the prior ensemble, one obtains\na simplied regression coefficient. We investigate differences between this\nsimplified regression coefficient and differential sensitivity using simple\nforward models. For linear forward models, the simplied regression coefficient\nis equal to differential sensitivity, except for the influences of the sampling\nerror and of the correlation structure of the prior distribution. In the\nnon-linear case, the behaviour of the simplified regression coefficient as\nsensitivity measure is analysed for a simple non-linear forward model and a\nfrequency-domain electromagnetic forward model.

AC-OPF is traditionally cast as a\nconstrained optimization problem that seeks optimal generation set points\nwhilst fulfilling a set of non-linear equality constraints -- the power flow\nequations. With increasing penetration of renewable generation, grid operators\nneed to solve larger problems at shorter intervals. This motivates the research\ninterest in learning OPF solutions with neural networks, which have fast\ninference time and is potentially scalable to large networks. The main\ndifficulty in solving the AC-OPF problem lies in dealing with this equality\nconstraint that has spurious roots, i.e. there are assignments of voltages that\nfulfill the power flow equations that however are not physically realizable.\nThis property renders any method relying on projected-gradients brittle because\nthese non-physical roots can act as attractors.

So far, there are two kinds of approaches for\ncoarse-grained selection module: (1) sparse representation; (2) dense\nrepresentation. To the best of our knowledge, there is no systematic comparison\nbetween these two approaches in retrieval-based chatbots, and which kind of\nmethod is better in real scenarios is still an open question. In this paper, we\nfirst systematically compare these two methods from four aspects: (1)\neffectiveness; (2) index stoarge; (3) search time cost; (4) human evaluation.\nExtensive experiment results demonstrate that dense representation method\nsignificantly outperforms the sparse representation, but costs more time and\nstorage occupation. In order to overcome these fatal weaknesses of dense\nrepresentation method, we propose an ultra-fast, low-storage, and highly\neffective Deep Semantic Hashing Coarse-grained selection method, called DSHC\nmodel. Specifically, in our proposed DSHC model, a hashing optimizing module\nthat consists of two autoencoder models is stacked on a trained dense\nrepresentation model, and three loss functions are designed to optimize it. The\nhash codes provided by hashing optimizing module effectively preserve the rich\nsemantic and similarity information in dense vectors.

For many\ntwo dimensional van der Waals materials, twisting two adjacent layers with\nrespect to each other leads to flat electronic bands in the two corresponding\nspatial directions -- a notion sometimes referred to as twistronics as it\nenables a wealth of physical phenomena. Within this two dimensional plane,\nlarge moir\\'e patterns of nanometer size form.

If the pattern is chosen such that with respect to the stacking\ndirection of layers, the large spatial moir\\'e features are spatially shifted\nfrom one twisted layer to the next, the system exhibits twist angle controlled\nflat bands in all of the three spatial directions. With this, our proposal\nextends the use of twistronic to three dimensions.

For hexagonal boron nitride we develope an ab initio fitted\ntight binding model that captures the corresponding three dimensional\nlow-energy electronic structure.

Instead of making do with\nselected small areas, it is shown here that the wide variation of signal level\nin a spectroscopic `flat-field' can be used to obtain accurate values of the\nCCD gain, needing only a matched pair of exposures (that differ in their\nrealisation of the noise). Once the gain is known, the CCD readout noise (in\nelectrons) is easily found from a pair of bias frames. Spatial stability of the\nimage in the two flat-fields is important, although correction of minor shifts\nis shown to be possible, at the expense of further analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2020 00:04:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-28"}

Since a black hole's event\nhorizon absorbs all electromagnetic waves, it is difficult to actively probe\nthe horizon's existence. However, with the help of a family of extremely\ncompact, horizon-less objects, named gravastars\", whose external space-times\nnearly identical to those of black holes, one can test the absence of event\nhorizons: absences of additional features that arise due to the existence of\nthe gravastar, or its surface, can be used as quantitative evidence for black\nholes.

In\nboth cases, the transmission of rays through gravastars, or their reflections\non their surfaces, lead to more rings in their images. For simple emission\nmodels, where the redshifted emissivity of the disk is peaked at a particular\nradius r-peak, the position of a series of rings can be related in a simple\nmanner to light ray propagation: a ring shows up around impact parameter b\nwhenever rays incident from infinity at b intersects the disk at r-peak. We\nshow that additional rings will appear in the images of transparent and\nreflective gravastars. In particular, one of the additional rings for the\nreflective gravastar is due to the prompt reflection of light on the gravastar\nsurface and appears to be well separated from the others.

This often leads to a\nvariety of cyber-attacks, including botnet network attacks. One promising\nsolution to detect DNS-based botnet attacks is adopting machine learning (ML)\nbased solutions. To that end, this paper proposes a novel optimized ML-based\nframework to detect botnets based on their corresponding DNS queries. More\nspecifically, the framework consists of using information gain as a feature\nselection method and genetic algorithm (GA) as a hyper-parameter optimization\nmodel to tune the parameters of a random forest (RF) classifier. The proposed\nframework is evaluated using a state-of-the-art TI-2016 DNS dataset.\nExperimental results show that the proposed optimized framework reduced the\nfeature set size by up to 60%. Moreover, it achieved a high detection accuracy,\nprecision, recall, and F-score compared to the default classifier. This\nhighlights the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed framework in\ndetecting botnet attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2020 16:34:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-22"}

Specifically, VQA models tend\nto answer questions (e.g., what color is the banana?) based on the\nhigh-frequency answers (e.g., yellow) ignoring image contents. Existing\napproaches tackle this problem by creating delicate models or introducing\nadditional visual annotations to reduce question dependency while strengthening\nimage dependency. However, they are still subject to the language prior problem\nsince the data biases have not been even alleviated. In this paper, we\nintroduce a self-supervised learning framework to solve this problem.\nConcretely, we first automatically generate labeled data to balance the biased\ndata, and propose a self-supervised auxiliary task to utilize the balanced data\nto assist the base VQA model to overcome language priors. Our method can\ncompensate for the data biases by generating balanced data without introducing\nexternal annotations. Experimental results show that our method can\nsignificantly outperform the state-of-the-art, improving the overall accuracy\nfrom 49.50% to 57.59% on the most commonly used benchmark VQA-CP v2.

These techniques operate by assigning video frames to\nclusters and then representing the video by aggregating residuals of frames\nwith respect to the mean of each cluster. Since some clusters may see very\nlittle video-specific data, these features can be noisy. In this paper, we\npropose a new cluster-and-aggregate method which we call smoothed Gaussian\nmixture model (SGMM), and its end-to-end discriminatively trained equivalent,\nwhich we call deep smoothed Gaussian mixture model (DSGMM). SGMM represents\neach video by the parameters of a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) trained for that\nvideo. Low-count clusters are addressed by smoothing the video-specific\nestimates with a universal background model (UBM) trained on a large number of\nvideos. The primary benefit of SGMM over VLAD is smoothing which makes it less\nsensitive to small number of training samples. We show, through extensive\nexperiments on the YouTube-8M classification task, that SGMM/DSGMM is\nconsistently better than VLAD/NetVLAD by a small but statistically significant\nmargin.
