In particular, gaze transition entropy (GTE) is a\npopular method to quantify the predictability of fixation transitions. However,\nGTE does not account for temporal dependencies beyond two consecutive fixations\nand may thus underestimate a scanpath's actual predictability. Instead, we\npropose to quantify scanpath predictability by estimating the active\ninformation storage (AIS), which can account for dependencies spanning multiple\nfixations. AIS is calculated as the mutual information between a processes'\nmultivariate past state and its next value. It is thus able to measure how much\ninformation a sequence of past fixations provides about the next fixation,\nhence covering a longer temporal horizon. Applying the proposed approach, we\nwere able to distinguish between induced observer states based on estimated\nAIS, providing first evidence that AIS may be used in the inference of user\nstates to improve human-machine interaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2020 16:02:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-24"}

We find that in heterostructures with dissimilar chalcogen\nspecies there is a strong compression of the inter-layer spacing, compared to\nthe bulk compounds. This compression of the heterostructure is caused by an\nincrease in the strength of the induced polarization interaction between the\nlayers, but not a full charge transfer. We argue that this effect is real, not\ndue to the imposed commensurability, and should be observable in\nheterostructures combining different chalcogens. Interestingly, we find that\nincommensurate stacking of Ti-based dichalcogenides leads to the stabilization\nof the charge density wave phonon mode, which is unstable in the 1T phase at\nlow temperature. Mixed Ti- and Zr-heterostructures are still unstable, but with\na charge density wave or a ferroelectric instability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2020 16:29:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-16"}

However, they still remain challenging, and\ntheir solutions need to be further improved for real-world applications in\nterms of both accuracy and efficiency. In this paper, we propose a hybrid\nneural architecture, called Self-Attentive Recurrent Convolutional Networks\n(SARCoN), to learn multi-faceted representations for univariate time series.\nSARCoN is the synthesis of long short-term memory networks with self-attentive\nmechanisms and Fully Convolutional Networks, which work in parallel to learn\nthe representations of univariate time series from different perspectives. The\ncomponent modules of the proposed architecture are trained jointly in an\nend-to-end manner and they classify the input time series in a cooperative way.\nDue to its domain-agnostic nature, SARCoN is able to generalize a diversity of\ndomain tasks. Our experimental results show that, compared to the\nstate-of-the-art approaches for time series classification, the proposed\narchitecture can achieve remarkable improvements for a set of univariate time\nseries benchmarks from the UCR repository. Moreover, the self-attention and the\nglobal average pooling in the proposed architecture enable visible\ninterpretability by facilitating the identification of the contribution regions\nof the original time series. An overall analysis confirms that multi-faceted\nrepresentations of time series aid in capturing deep temporal corrections\nwithin complex time series, which is essential for the improvement of time\nseries classification performance. Our work provides a novel angle that deepens\nthe understanding of time series classification, qualifying our proposed model\nas an ideal choice for real-world applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2020 16:42:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-22"}

Revisiting the original\nresult, we observe that the key observation, i.e. that only threshold\nscattering information can be extracted at large separations, can be understood\nby interpreting the correlator as a spectral function, $\\rho(\\omega)$,\nconvoluted with the Euclidean kernel, $e^{- \\omega t}$, which is sharply peaked\nat threshold. We therefore consider a modification in which a smooth step\nfunction, equal to one above a target energy, is inserted in the spectral\ndecomposition. This can be achieved either through Backus-Gilbert-like methods\nor more directly using the variational approach. The result is a shifted\nresolution function, such that the large $t$ limit projects onto scattering or\ndecay amplitudes above threshold. The utility of this method is highlighted\nthrough large $t$ expansions of both three- and four-point functions that\ninclude leading terms proportional to the real and imaginary parts (separately)\nof the target observable.

Given a\nfield K of characteristic zero, a term a(n) is called hypergeometric with\nrespect to K, if the ratio a(n+1)/a(n) is a rational function over K. The\nsolutions space of holonomic recurrence equations gained more interest in the\n1990s from the well known Zeilberger's algorithm. In particular, algorithms\ncomputing the subspace of hypergeometric term solutions which covers\npolynomial, rational, and some algebraic solutions of these equations were\ninvestigated by Marko Petkov\\v{s}ek (1993) and Mark van Hoeij (1999). The\nalgorithm proposed by the latter is characterized by a much better efficiency\nthan that of the other; it computes, in Gamma representations, a basis of the\nsubspace of hypergeometric term solutions of any given holonomic recurrence\nequation, and is considered as the current state of the art in this area.

The problem of ZO optimization has emerged in many\nrecent machine learning applications, where the gradient of the objective\nfunction is either unavailable or difficult to compute. In such cases, we can\napproximate the full gradients or stochastic gradients through function value\nbased gradient estimates. Here, we propose a novel hybrid gradient estimator\n(HGE), which takes advantage of the query-efficiency of random gradient\nestimates as well as the variance-reduction of coordinate-wise gradient\nestimates.

Developing an effective partial discharge\ndetection system can lead to significant savings on maintenance and prevent\npower disruptions. Traditional methods rely on hand-crafted features and domain\nexpertise to identify partial discharge patterns in the electrical current.\nMany data-driven deep learning-based methods have been proposed in recent years\nto remove these ad hoc feature extraction. However, most of these methods\neither operate in the time-domain or frequency-domain. Many research approaches\nhave been developed to generate phase-resolved partial discharge (PRPD)\npatterns from raw PD sensor data.

Most prior work in offline RL has focused on tasks with\ncompact state representations.

With the technological possibility of producing\nmaterials with antagonist wetting behavior, as for example a substrate that\nrepeal water and absorb oil, the understanding of the properties that control\nthis selective capacity has increased with the goal of being used as mechanism\nto separate mixed liquids. Besides the experimental advance in this field, less\nis known from the theoretical side. In this work we propose a theoretical model\nto predict the wetting properties of a given substrate and introduce\nsimulations with a 4-spins cellular Potts model to study its efficiency in\nseparating water from oil. Our results show that the efficiency of the\nsubstrates depends both on the interaction between the liquids and on the\nwetting behavior of the substrates itself. The water behavior of the droplet\ncomposed of both liquids is roughly controlled by the hidrophobicity of the\nsubstrate. To predict the oil behavior, however, is more complex because the\nsubstrate being oleophilic do not guarantee that the total amount of oil\npresent on the droplet will be absorbed by the substrate. For both types of\nsubstrates considered is this work, pillared and porous with a reservoir, there\nis always an amount of reminiscent oil on the droplet which is not absorbed by\nthe substrate due to the interaction with the water and the gas. Both\ntheoretical and numerical models can be easily modified to analyse other types\nof substrates and liquids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2020 18:41:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-31"}

However, in fields such as demographics (for e.g.\nbirth years), outliers may be more easily found in terms of the histogram\nsmoothness where techniques such as Whipple's or Myers' indices handle\nsuccessfully only specific anomalies. This paper proposes smoothness outliers\ndetection among histograms by using the relation between their discrete total\nvariations (DTV) and their respective sample sizes. This relation is\nmathematically derived to be applicable in all cases and simplified by an\naccurate linear model. The deviation of the histogram's DTV from the value\npredicted by the model is used as the outlier score and the proposed method is\nnamed Total Variation Outlier Recognizer (TVOR). TVOR requires no prior\nassumptions about the histograms' samples' distribution, it has no\nhyperparameters that require tuning, it is not limited to only specific\npatterns, and it is applicable to histograms with the same bins. Each bin can\nhave an arbitrary interval that can also be unbounded. TVOR finds DTV outliers\neasier than Pearson's chi-squared test. In case of distribution outliers, the\nopposite holds.

We use a dynamical-radiative numerical\nmodel and multiwavelength data to constrain the properties of a pulsar wind\nthat may power the non-thermal emitter in LS~5039.

Such interactions involve physical contact between surfaces that is\nsemantically meaningful. Our goal is to learn how humans interact with scenes\nand leverage this to enable virtual characters to do the same. To that end, we\nintroduce a novel Human-Scene Interaction (HSI) model that encodes proximal\nrelationships, called POSA for \"Pose with prOximitieS and contActs\". The\nrepresentation of interaction is body-centric, which enables it to generalize\nto new scenes. Specifically, POSA augments the SMPL-X parametric human body\nmodel such that, for every mesh vertex, it encodes (a) the contact probability\nwith the scene surface and (b) the corresponding semantic scene label. We learn\nPOSA with a VAE conditioned on the SMPL-X vertices, and train on the PROX\ndataset, which contains SMPL-X meshes of people interacting with 3D scenes, and\nthe corresponding scene semantics from the PROX-E dataset. We demonstrate the\nvalue of POSA with two applications. First, we automatically place 3D scans of\npeople in scenes. We use a SMPL-X model fit to the scan as a proxy and then\nfind its most likely placement in 3D. POSA provides an effective representation\nto search for \"affordances\" in the scene that match the likely contact\nrelationships for that pose. We perform a perceptual study that shows\nsignificant improvement over the state of the art on this task. Second, we show\nthat POSA's learned representation of body-scene interaction supports monocular\nhuman pose estimation that is consistent with a 3D scene, improving on the\nstate of the art.

Over the last few years, we have seen significant\nprogress on visual question answering. Though impressive as the accuracy grows,\nit still lags behind to get knowing whether these models are undertaking\ngrounding visual reasoning or just leveraging spurious correlations in the\ntraining data. Recently, a number of works have attempted to answer this\nquestion from perspectives such as grounding and robustness. However, most of\nthem are either focusing on the language side or coarsely studying the\npixel-level attention maps. In this paper, by leveraging the step-wise object\ngrounding annotations provided in the GQA dataset, we first present a\nsystematical object-centric diagnosis of visual reasoning on grounding and\nrobustness, particularly on the vision side. According to the extensive\ncomparisons across different models, we find that even models with high\naccuracy are not good at grounding objects precisely, nor robust to visual\ncontent perturbations. In contrast, symbolic and modular models have a\nrelatively better grounding and robustness, though at the cost of accuracy. To\nreconcile these different aspects, we further develop a diagnostic model,\nnamely Graph Reasoning Machine. Our model replaces purely symbolic visual\nrepresentation with probabilistic scene graph and then applies teacher-forcing\ntraining for the visual reasoning module.

Methods.\nTo evaluate the extension of the X-ray emission around 3C 187 we extracted\nsurface flux profiles along and across the radio axis. We also extracted X-ray\nspectra in the region of the radio lobes and in the cross-cone region to\nestimate the contribution of the non-thermal (IC/CMB) and thermal (IGM)\nprocesses to the observed emission, making use of radio (VLA and GMRT) data to\ninvestigate the multi-wavelength emission arising from the lobes. We collected\nPan-STARRS photometric data to investigate the presence of a galaxy cluster\nhosting 3C 187, looking for the presence of a \"red sequence\" in the source\nfield in the form of a tight clustering of the galaxies in the color space...\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2020 19:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-17"}

This partial order,\nwhich we build by defining the notion of relative passivity, offers a\nfine-grained comparison between passive states based on virtual temperatures\n(just like thermal states are compared based on their temperatures). We then\ncharacterize the quantum operations that are closed on the set of virtually\ncooler states with respect to some fixed input and output passive states.\nViewing the activity, i.e., non-passivity, of a state as a resource, our main\nresult is then a necessary and sufficient condition on the transformation of a\nclass of pure active states under these relative passivity-preserving\noperations. This condition gives a quantum thermodynamical meaning to the\nmajorization relation on the set of non-increasing vectors due to Hoffman. The\nmaximum extractable work under relative passivity-preserving operations is then\nshown to be equal to the ergotropy of these pure active states. Finally, we are\nable to fully characterize passivity-preserving operations in the simpler case\nof qubit systems, and hence to derive a state interconversion condition under\npassivity-preserving qubit operations. The prospect of this work is a general\nresource-theoretical framework for the extractable work via quantum operations\ngoing beyond thermal operations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2020 19:00:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Aug 2021 15:19:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-13"}

In\nthis study, we discuss the rich morphology revealed by the X-ray observations\n(also in combination with the SZ data) and argue that the most salient features\ncan be naturally explained by a recent (on-going) merger with the NGC 4839\ngroup. In particular, we identify a faint X-ray bridge connecting the group\nwith the cluster, which is convincing proof that NGC 4839 has already crossed\nthe main cluster. The gas in the Coma core went through two shocks, first\nthrough the shock driven by NGC 4839 during its first passage through the\ncluster some Gyr ago, and, more recently, through the \"mini-accretion shock\"\nassociated with the gas settling back to quasi-hydrostatic equilibrium in the\ncore. After passing through the primary shock, the gas should spend much of the\ntime in a rarefaction region, where radiative losses of electrons are small,\nuntil the gas is compressed again by the mini-accretion shock. Unlike \"runway\"\nmerger shocks, the mini-accretion shock does not feature a rarefaction region\ndownstream and, therefore, the radio emission can survive longer. Such a\ntwo-stage process might explain the formation of the radio halo in the Coma\ncluster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2020 19:00:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 May 2021 19:40:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-14"}

These large samples of LAEs are useful to address two major astrophysical\nissues, galaxy formation and cosmic reionization. Statistical studies have\nrevealed the general picture of LAEs' physical properties: young stellar\npopulations, remarkable luminosity function evolutions, compact morphologies,\nhighly ionized inter-stellar media (ISM) with low metal/dust contents, low\nmasses of dark-matter halos. Typical LAEs represent low-mass high-$z$ galaxies,\nhigh-$z$ analogs of dwarf galaxies, some of which are thought to be candidates\nof population III galaxies. These observational studies have also pinpointed\nrare bright Ly$\\alpha$ sources extended over $\\sim 10-100$ kpc, dubbed\nLy$\\alpha$ blobs, whose physical origins are under debate. LAEs are used as\nprobes of cosmic reionization history through the Ly$\\alpha$ damping wing\nabsorption given by the neutral hydrogen of the inter-galactic medium (IGM),\nwhich complement the cosmic microwave background radiation and 21cm\nobservations. The low-mass and highly-ionized population of LAEs can be major\nsources of cosmic reionization. The budget of ionizing photons for cosmic\nreionization has been constrained, although there remain large observational\nuncertainties in the parameters. Beyond galaxy formation and cosmic\nreionization, several new usages of LAEs for science frontiers have been\nsuggested such as the distribution of {\\sc Hi} gas in the circum-galactic\nmedium and filaments of large-scale structures.

Contrary to results reported in certain earlier papers, the new\nanalysis finds that concerted hopping events do occur in all simulations, but\nthat the majority of events are the product of proton rattling, where the\nexcess proton will rattle between two or more waters.

Word alignment plays\na key role in this setting. However, most of the existing word alignment\nmethods are designed for a high resource setting in machine translation where\nmillions of parallel sentences are available. This amount reduces to a few\nthousands of sentences when dealing with low-resource languages failing the\nexisting established IBM models. In this paper, we propose subword\nsampling-based alignment of text units. This method's hypothesis is that the\naggregation of different granularities of text for certain language pairs can\nhelp word-level alignment. For certain languages for which gold-standard\nalignments exist, we propose an iterative Bayesian optimization framework to\noptimize selecting possible subwords from the space of possible subword\nrepresentations of the source and target sentences. We show that the subword\nsampling method consistently outperforms word-level alignment on six language\npairs: English-German, English-French, English-Romanian, English-Persian,\nEnglish-Hindi, and English-Inuktitut. In addition, we show that the\nhyperparameters learned for certain language pairs can be applied to other\nlanguages at no supervision and consistently improve the alignment results. We\nobserve that using $5K$ parallel sentences together with our proposed subword\nsampling approach, we obtain similar F1 scores to the use of $100K$'s of\nparallel sentences in existing word-level fast-align/eflomal alignment methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2020 19:47:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Jun 2021 21:38:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-17"}

The central reasons for this are largely\ndue to the so-called curse of dimensionality, combined with the black-box\nnature of the resulting control policies themselves. This paper aims at the\nfirst of these issues. Although the full state space of a system may be quite\nlarge in dimensionality, it is a common feature of most model-based control\nmethods that the resulting closed-loop systems demonstrate dominant dynamics\nthat are rapidly driven to some lower-dimensional sub-space within. In this\nwork we argue that the dimensionality of this subspace is captured by tools\nfrom fractal geometry, namely various notions of a fractional dimension.

We investigate the structure of the jet-wind\nsystem for a model of Population III microquasar on scales beyond the jet-wind\nformation region. Using relativistic hydrodynamic simulations we find that the\nratio of kinetic power between the jet and the disk wind determines the\nconfiguration of the system. When the power is dominated by the wind, the jet\nfills a narrow channel, collimated by the dense outflow. When the jet dominates\nthe power of the system, part of its energy is diverted turning the wind into a\nquasi-equatorial flow, while the jet widens. From the results of our\nsimulations, we implement semi-analytical calculations of the impact of the\nquasiequatorial wind on scales of the order of the size of the binary system.\nOur results indicate that Population III microquasars might inject gamma rays\nand relativistic particles into the early intergalactic medium, contributing to\nits reionization at large distances from the binary system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2020 20:18:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-23"}

Typically, this problem is\ntackled by training binary classifiers on historical data. Unfortunately,\nrecent research has shown that such approaches underperform due to the\nfollowing two reasons: a) the imbalanced nature of the problem, and b) the\ninherently noisy historical data, i.e., most vulnerabilities are discovered\nmuch later than they are introduced. This misleads classifiers as they learn to\nrecognize actual vulnerable components as non-vulnerable. To tackle these\nissues, we propose TROVON, a technique that learns from known vulnerable\ncomponents rather than from vulnerable and non-vulnerable components, as\ntypically performed. We perform this by contrasting the known vulnerable, and\ntheir respective fixed components. This way, TROVON manages to learn from the\nthings we know, i.e., vulnerabilities, hence reducing the effects of noisy and\nunbalanced data.

Lynden-Bell on\nviolent relaxation and extends to the issue of virialization of dark matter\n(DM) halos. An important prediction of such a relaxation process is that\nspherical equilibrium states can be described by a Fermi-Dirac phase-space\ndistribution, when the extremization of a coarse-grained entropy is reached. In\nthe case of DM fermions, the most general solution develops a degenerate\ncompact core surrounded by a diluted halo. As shown recently, the latter is\nable to explain the galaxy rotation curves while the DM core can mimic the\ncentral black hole. A yet open problem is whether this kind of astrophysical\ncore-halo configurations can form at all, and if they remain stable within\ncosmological timescales. We assess these issues by performing a thermodynamic\nstability analysis in the microcanonical ensemble for solutions with given\nparticle number at halo virialization in a cosmological framework. For the\nfirst time we demonstrate that the above core-halo DM profiles are stable (i.e.\nmaxima of entropy) and extremely long lived. We find the existence of a\ncritical point at the onset of instability of the core-halo solutions, where\nthe fermion-core collapses towards a supermassive black hole. For particle\nmasses in the keV range, the core-collapse can only occur for $M_{\\rm vir}\n\\gtrsim 10^9 M_\\odot$ starting at $z_{\\rm vir}\\approx 10$ in the given\ncosmological framework.

Despite promising progress, existing representations\nlearned with neural networks still struggle to generalize in closed-loop\npredictions (e.g., output colliding trajectories). This issue largely arises\nfrom the non-i.i.d. nature of sequential prediction in conjunction with\nill-distributed training data. Intuitively, if the training data only comes\nfrom human behaviors in safe spaces, i.e., from \"positive\" examples, it is\ndifficult for learning algorithms to capture the notion of \"negative\" examples\nlike collisions. In this work, we aim to address this issue by explicitly\nmodeling negative examples through self-supervision: (i) we introduce a social\ncontrastive loss that regularizes the extracted motion representation by\ndiscerning the ground-truth positive events from synthetic negative ones; (ii)\nwe construct informative negative samples based on our prior knowledge of rare\nbut dangerous circumstances.

Nonthermal radiation, such as\nphotoluminescence, is a fundamental light matter interaction that\nconventionally involves the absorption of an energetic photon, thermalization,\nand the emission of a redshifted photon. Such a quantum process is governed by\nrate conservation, which is contingent on the quantum efficiency. In the past,\nthe role of rate conservation for significant thermal excitation had not been\nstudied. Recently, we presented the theory and an experimental demonstration\nthat showed, in contrast to thermal emission, that the PL rate is conserved\nwhen the temperature increases while each photon is blueshifted. A further rise\nin temperature leads to an abrupt transition to thermal emission where the\nphoton rate increases sharply. We also demonstrated how such thermally enhanced\nPL, TEPL, generates orders of magnitude more energetic photons than thermal\nemission at similar temperatures. These findings show that TEPL is an ideal\noptical heat pump that can harvest thermal losses in photovoltaics with a\nmaximal theoretical efficiency of 70%, and practical concepts potentially\nreaching 45% efficiency. Here we move the TEPL concept onto the engineering\nlevel and present Cr:Nd:YAG as device grade PL material, absorbing solar\nradiation up to 1 micrometer wavelength and heated by thermalization of\nenergetic photons. Its blueshifted emission, which can match GaAs cells, is 20%\nof the absorbed power. Based on a detailed balance simulation, such a material\ncoupled with proper photonic management can reach 34% power conversion\nefficiency. These results raise confidence in the potential of TEPL becoming a\ndisruptive technology in photovoltaics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2020 22:26:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-23"}

In a previous paper we\nstudied the Solar-wind (SW) models used in pulsar timing to mitigate the excess\nof DM annually induced by the SW, and found these to be insufficient for\nhigh-precision pulsar timing. Here we analyze additional pulsar datasets to\nfurther investigate which aspects of the SW models currently used in pulsar\ntiming can be readily improved, and at what levels of timing precision SW\nmitigation is possible. Our goals are to verify: a) whether the data are better\ndescribed by a spherical model of the SW with a time-variable amplitude rather\nthan a time-invariant one as suggested in literature, b) whether a temporal\ntrend of such a model's amplitudes can be detected. We use the pulsar-timing\ntechnique on low-frequency pulsar observations to estimate the DM and quantify\nhow this value changes as the Earth moves around the Sun. Specifically, we\nmonitor the DM in weekly to monthly observations of 14 pulsars taken with LOFAR\nacross time spans of up to 6 years. We develop an informed algorithm to\nseparate the interstellar variations in DM from those caused by the SW and\ndemonstrate the functionality of this algorithm with extensive simulations.\nAssuming a spherically symmetric model for the SW density, we derive the\namplitude of this model for each year of observations. We show that a spherical\nmodel with time-variable amplitude models the observations better than a\nspherical model with constant amplitude, but that both approaches leave\nsignificant SW induced delays uncorrected in a number of pulsars in the sample.\nThe amplitude of the spherical model is found to be variable in time, as\nopposed to what has been previously suggested.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2020 22:44:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-17"}

The use of quantum calculations in machine learning enables the\ngeneration of a diverse dataset and ensures that learning is less affected by\nnoise inherent to experimental databases. In this work, we propose a transfer\nlearning approach for the prediction of solvation free energies that combines\nfundamentals from quantum calculations with the higher accuracy of experimental\nmeasurements. The employed model architecture is based on the directed-message\npassing neural network for the molecular embedding of solvent and solute\nmolecules. A significant advantage of models pre-trained on quantum\ncalculations is demonstrated for small experimental datasets and for\nout-of-sample predictions. The improved out-of-sample performance is shown for\nnew solvents, for new solute elements, and for the extension to higher molar\nmass solutes. The overall performance of the pre-trained models is limited by\nthe noise in the experimental test data, known as the aleatoric uncertainty. On\na random test split, a mean absolute error of 0.21 kcal/mol is achieved. This\nis a significant improvement compared to the mean absolute error of the quantum\ncalculations (0.40 kcal/mol).

Some of these latent variables may be\npartially correlated with the phenotype of interest and therefore helpful,\nwhile others may be uncorrelated and thus merely contribute additional noise.\nMoreover, whether potentially helpful or not, these latent variables may\nobscure weaker effects that impact only a small number of features but more\ndirectly capture the signal of primary interest. We propose the\ncross-residualization classifier to better account for the latent variables in\ngenomic data. Through an adjustment and ensemble procedure, the\ncross-residualization classifier essentially estimates the latent variables and\nresidualizes out their effects, trains a classifier on the residuals, and then\nre-integrates the the latent variables in a final ensemble classifier.

One of the popular methods is Counterfactual\nExplanation (CE), also known as Actionable Recourse, which provides a user with\na perturbation vector of features that alters the prediction result. Given a\nperturbation vector, a user can interpret it as an \"action\" for obtaining one's\ndesired decision result. In practice, however, showing only a perturbation\nvector is often insufficient for users to execute the action. The reason is\nthat if there is an asymmetric interaction among features, such as causality,\nthe total cost of the action is expected to depend on the order of changing\nfeatures. Therefore, practical CE methods are required to provide an\nappropriate order of changing features in addition to a perturbation vector.\nFor this purpose, we propose a new framework called Ordered Counterfactual\nExplanation (OrdCE).

Moreover, the agent needs to follow a consistent high-level policy to\ntransfer the learned teammate preferences to a new scenario while lower-level\ndetailed plans are different. Our evaluation confirmed the process of\nunderstanding an explanation, especially a complex and detailed explanation, is\nhierarchical. The human preference that reflected this aspect corresponded\nexactly to creating and employing abstraction for knowledge assimilation hidden\ndeeper in our cognitive process. We showed that hierarchical explanations\nachieved better task performance and behavior interpretability while reduced\ncognitive load. These results shed light on designing explainable agents\nutilizing reinforcement learning and planning across various domains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Dec 2020 02:14:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Feb 2021 03:42:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-01"}

Furthermore, we provide a theoretical justification that\nthis numerical algorithm has a unique solution, such that the positivity is\nalways preserved for the phase variable at a point-wise level, so that a\nsingularity is avoided in the scheme. In fact, the singular nature of the\nLeonard-Jones potential term around the value of 0 prevents the numerical\nsolution reaching such singular value, so that the positivity structure is\nalways preserved.

Embedding a Kalman Filter (KF) or\nany of its extensions such as extended and unscented Kalman filters with the\noptical tracker resolves this issue by reducing the estimation variance and\nregularizing the temporal behavior. However, the current rigid-body KF\nimplementations are computationally burdensome and hence, takes long execution\ntime which hinders real-time surgical tracking.

However, estimation of the parameters of $N_p(\\mu,\\Sigma)$ under\njoint constraints such as $\\Sigma\\mu = \\mu$ has not received much attention. It\ncan be viewed as a multivariate counterpart of the classical estimation problem\nin the $N(\\theta,\\theta^2)$ distribution. In addition to the usual inference\nchallenges under such non-linear constraints among the parameters (curved\nexponential family), one has to deal with the basic requirements of symmetry\nand positive definiteness when estimating a covariance matrix. We derive the\nnon-linear likelihood equations for the constrained maximum likelihood\nestimator of $(\\mu,\\Sigma)$ and solve them using iterative methods. Generally,\nthe MLE of covariance matrices computed using iterative methods do not satisfy\nthe constraints. We propose a novel algorithm to modify such (infeasible)\nestimators or any other (reasonable) estimator. The key step is to re-align the\nmean vector along the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix using the idea of\nregression. In using the Lagrangian function for constrained MLE (Aitchison et\nal. 1958), the Lagrange multiplier entangles with the parameters of interest\nand presents another computational challenge.

Since\nmanual analysis is highly time and effort consuming, computer-assisted\nautomatic chromosome karyotype analysis based on images is routinely used to\nimprove the efficiency and accuracy of the analysis. Due to the strip shape of\nthe chromosomes, they easily get overlapped with each other when imaged,\nsignificantly affecting the accuracy of the analysis afterward. Conventional\noverlapping chromosome segmentation methods are usually based on manually\ntagged features, hence, the performance of which is easily affected by the\nquality, such as resolution and brightness, of the images. To address the\nproblem, in this paper, we present an adversarial multiscale feature learning\nframework to improve the accuracy and adaptability of overlapping chromosome\nsegmentation. Specifically, we first adopt the nested U-shape network with\ndense skip connections as the generator to explore the optimal representation\nof the chromosome images by exploiting multiscale features.

Departing from the recent literature which largely assumes the label\nnoise rate is only determined by the true label class, the errors in\nhuman-annotated labels are more likely to be dependent on the difficulty levels\nof tasks, resulting in settings with instance-dependent label noise. We first\nprovide evidences that the heterogeneous instance-dependent label noise is\neffectively down-weighting the examples with higher noise rates in a\nnon-uniform way and thus causes imbalances, rendering the strategy of directly\napplying methods for class-dependent label noise questionable. Built on a\nrecent work peer loss [24], we then propose and study the potentials of a\nsecond-order approach that leverages the estimation of several covariance terms\ndefined between the instance-dependent noise rates and the Bayes optimal label.\nWe show that this set of second-order statistics successfully captures the\ninduced imbalances. We further proceed to show that with the help of the\nestimated second-order statistics, we identify a new loss function whose\nexpected risk of a classifier under instance-dependent label noise is\nequivalent to a new problem with only class-dependent label noise.

Therefore, we proposed a saliency model\nto predict the saliency map, which can capture both scene semantic and\ngeometric information.

Several techniques,\nlike the multiple PRFs (MPRF) method, have been proposed to mitigate this\nproblem. The drawback of the MPRF method is that the received samples are not\nprocessed jointly, decreasing signal to noise ratio (SNR). To overcome the\ndrawbacks of MPRF, we employ a random pulse phase coding approach to increase\nthe unambiguous range region while preserving the unambiguous Doppler region.\nOur method encodes each pulse with a random phase, varying from pulse to pulse,\nand then processes the received samples jointly to resolve the range ambiguity.\nThis technique increases the SNR through joint processing without the parameter\nmatching procedures required in the MPRF method. The recovery algorithm is\ndesigned based on orthogonal matching pursuit so that it can be directly\napplied to either Nyquist or sub-Nyquist samples. The unambiguous delay-Doppler\nrecovery condition is derived with compressed sensing theory in noiseless\nsettings. In particular, an upper bound to the number of targets is given, with\nrespect to the number of samples in each pulse repetition interval and the\nnumber of transmit pulses.

SIMDRAM consists of\nthree key steps to enable a desired operation in DRAM: (1) building an\nefficient majority-based representation of the desired operation, (2) mapping\nthe operation input and output operands to DRAM rows and to the required DRAM\ncommands that produce the desired operation, and (3) executing the operation.\nThese three steps ensure efficient computation of any arbitrary and complex\noperation in DRAM. The first two steps give users the flexibility to\nefficiently implement and compute any desired operation in DRAM. The third step\ncontrols the execution flow of the in-DRAM computation, transparently from the\nuser.

To solve this\nissue, meta-learning formulates ASR for each source language into many small\nASR tasks and meta-learns a model initialization on all tasks from different\nsource languages to access fast adaptation on unseen target languages. However,\nfor different source languages, the quantity and difficulty vary greatly\nbecause of their different data scales and diverse phonological systems, which\nleads to task-quantity and task-difficulty imbalance issues and thus a failure\nof multilingual meta-learning ASR (MML-ASR). In this work, we solve this\nproblem by developing a novel adversarial meta sampling (AMS) approach to\nimprove MML-ASR. When sampling tasks in MML-ASR, AMS adaptively determines the\ntask sampling probability for each source language. Specifically, for each\nsource language, if the query loss is large, it means that its tasks are not\nwell sampled to train ASR model in terms of its quantity and difficulty and\nthus should be sampled more frequently for extra learning.

By an appropriate sequence\nof measurements on the evolution of each degreeof freedom (DOF), the full\nquantum state of the observed photonic system can be determined. The first\nproposal to extend the application of QT to reconstruction of complete quantum\nstates of matter wavepackets had generated enormous interest in ultrafast\ndiffraction imaging and pump-probe spectroscopy of molecules. This interest was\nelevated with the advent of ultrafast electron and X-ray diffraction techniques\nusing electron accelerators and X-ray free electron lasers to add temporal\nresolution to the observed nuclear and electron distributions. However, the\ngreat interest in this area has been tempered by the illustration of an\nimpossibility theorem, known as the dimension problem. Not being able to\nassociate unitary evolution to every DOF of molecular motion, quantum\ntomography could not be used beyond 1D and categorically excludes most\nvibrational and all rotational motion of molecules. Here we present a\ntheoretical advance to overcome the notorious dimension problem. Solving this\nchallenging problem is important to push imaging molecular dynamics to the\nquantum limit. The new theory has solved this problem, which makes quantum\ntomography a truly useful methodology in ultrafast physics and enables the\nmaking of quantum version of a molecular movie. With the new theory, quantum\ntomography can be finally advanced to a sufficient level to become a general\nmethod for reconstructing quantum states of matter, without being limited in\none dimension.

Such models include parameters that are\nassigned specific meanings in relation to the system under consideration, which\nis examined by estimating the parameters using the corresponding data. As the\nparameters of unidentifiable models cannot be uniquely determined from the\ngiven data, it is difficult to examine the systems described by such models.

We consider compact dark\nobjects, which initially reside in the centers of NSs and which may consist of\nself-interacting dark matter (DM). By approximating the compact dark objects as\ntest particles, we model the merging of NS binaries hosting DM components with\nthree-dimensional relativistic simulations. Our simulation results suggest that\nthe DM components remain gravitationally bound and orbit inside the merger\nremnant with orbital separations of typically a few km. The subsequent orbital\nmotion of the DM components generates a GW signal with frequencies in the range\nof a few kHz. When considering a range of different binary masses and\nhigh-density equations of state (EoS), we find that the GW frequency of the\norbiting DM components scales with the compactness of NSs. Similarly, we find\nrelations between the DM GW frequency and the dominant postmerger GW frequency\nof the stellar fluid or the tidal deformability, which quantifies EoS effects\nduring the binary inspiral. Hence, a measurement of these quantities can be\nused to specify the frequency range of the GW emission by DM. Under the\nassumption that GW back reaction is the only relevant dissipative process, the\nGW signal may last between seconds and years depending on the mass of the DM\ncomponent. We estimate the detectability of the GW signals and find that DM\ncomponents in NS mergers may only be detectable with existing and projected GW\ninstruments if the dark objects are as massive as about 0.01 to 0.1 M_sun. We\nemphasize that the GW emission is limited by the lifetime of the remnant.

Such a collective behavior\noccurs spontaneously, i.e. is not caused by any specific interparticle force\nfavoring the alignment of the velocities. This phenomenon was investigated in\nthe absence of thermal noise and in the overdamped regime where inertial forces\ncould be neglected. In this work, we demonstrate through numerical simulations\nand theoretical analysis that the velocity alignment is a robust property of\nABP and persists even in the presence of inertial forces and thermal\nfluctuations. We also show that a single dimensionless parameter, such as the\nP\\'eclet number customarily employed in the description of self-propelled\nparticles, is not sufficient to fully characterize such a phenomenon neither in\nthe regimes of large viscosity nor small mass. Indeed, the size of the velocity\ndomains, measured through the correlation length of the spatial velocity\ncorrelation, remains constant when the swim velocity increases while decreases\nas the rotational diffusion becomes larger. We find that the spatial velocity\ncorrelation depends on the inertia but, contrary to common belief, are\nnon-symmetrically affected by mass and inverse viscosity variations. We\nconclude that in self-propelled systems, at variance with passive systems,\nvariations of the inertial time (mass over solvent viscosity) and mass act as\nindependent control parameters. Finally, we highlight the non-thermal nature of\nthe spatial velocity correlations that are fairly insensitive both to solvent\nand active temperatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Dec 2020 10:34:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-23"}

The main goal is to address the physical and chemical\nproperties as well as the dynamical state of the Serpens filament at a spatial\nresolution of $\\sim$0.07 pc and a spectral resolution of\n$\\lesssim$0.1~km~s$^{-1}$. We performed $^{13}$CO (1--0), C$^{18}$O (1--0),\nC$^{17}$O (1--0), $^{13}$CO (2--1), C$^{18}$O (2--1), and C$^{17}$O (2--1)\nimaging observations toward the Serpens filament with the Institut de\nRadioastronomie Millim{\\'e}trique 30-m (IRAM-30 m) and Atacama Pathfinder\nEXperiment (APEX) telescopes. Widespread narrow $^{13}$CO (2--1)\nself-absorption is observed in this filament, causing the $^{13}$CO morphology\nto be different from the filamentary structure traced by C$^{18}$O and\nC$^{17}$O. Our excitation analysis suggests that the opacities of C$^{18}$O\ntransitions become higher than unity in most regions, and this analysis\nconfirms the presence of widespread CO depletion. Further we show that the\nlocal velocity gradients have a tendency to be perpendicular to the filament's\nlong axis in the outskirts and parallel to the large-scale magnetic field\ndirection. The magnitudes of the local velocity gradients decrease toward the\nfilament's crest. The observed velocity structure can be a result of\ngravity-driven accretion flows. The isochronic evolutionary track of the\nC$^{18}$O freeze-out process indicates the filament is young with an age of\n$\\lesssim$2 Myr.

This has conditioned the preparation\nof the input signals, the network architecture, and the post-processing of the\noutput in line with the domain knowledge. Specifically, we focused the\ndiscussion on three main aspects: 1) how to aggregate the classification\nresults on signal segments provided by the DL model into a larger time scale,\nat the seizure-level; 2) what are the relevant frequency patterns learned in\nthe first convolutional layer of different models, and their relation with the\ndelta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma frequency bands on which the visual\ninterpretation of EEG is based; and 3) the identification of the signal\nwaveforms with larger contribution towards the ictal class, according to the\nactivation differences highlighted using the DeepLIFT method.

Next, specific examples of tight-binding models giving\nrise to lattice versions of the Dirac equation in various space dimension are\npresented: in 1D (Su-Schrieffer-Heeger and Rice-Mele models), 2D (graphene,\nboron nitride, Haldane model) and 3D (Weyl semi-metals). The focus is on\ntopological insulators and topological semi-metals. The latter have a Fermi\nsurface that is characterized as a topological defect.

Algorithms that achieve the optimal number of function\nevaluations for a given precision level typically rely on explicitly\nconstructing an approximation of the function which is then minimized with\nalgorithms that have exponential running-time complexity. In this paper, we\nconsider an approach that jointly models the function to approximate and finds\na global minimum. This is done by using infinite sums of square smooth\nfunctions and has strong links with polynomial sum-of-squares hierarchies.\nLeveraging recent representation properties of reproducing kernel Hilbert\nspaces, the infinite-dimensional optimization problem can be solved by\nsubsampling in time polynomial in the number of function evaluations, and with\ntheoretical guarantees on the obtained minimum.\n  Given $n$ samples, the computational cost is $O(n^{3.5})$ in time, $O(n^2)$\nin space, and we achieve a convergence rate to the global optimum that is\n$O(n^{-m/d + 1/2 + 3/d})$ where $m$ is the degree of differentiability of the\nfunction and $d$ the number of dimensions. The rate is nearly optimal in the\ncase of Sobolev functions and more generally makes the proposed method\nparticularly suitable for functions that have a large number of derivatives.\nIndeed, when $m$ is in the order of $d$, the convergence rate to the global\noptimum does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality, which affects only\nthe worst-case constants (that we track explicitly through the paper).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Dec 2020 12:59:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-23"}

To\naddress this issue, we propose a more natural and practical paradigm, i.e.,\nlow-resource medical dialogue generation, which can transfer the diagnostic\nexperience from source diseases to target ones with a handful of data for\nadaptation. It is capitalized on a commonsense knowledge graph to characterize\nthe prior disease-symptom relations.

However at low frequencies, Faraday rotation substantially\ndepolarizes the emission, meaning that comparatively few polarized radio\ngalaxies are known at low frequencies. Using the LOFAR Two Metre Sky Survey at\n150 MHz and at 20 arcsec resolution, we select 342 radio galaxies brighter than\n50 mJy and larger than 100 arcsec in angular size, of which 67 are polarized\n(18 per cent detection fraction).

We compare the sources\nin our sample detected by LOFAR to those also detected in NVSS at 1400 MHz, and\nfind that our selection bias toward bright radio galaxies drives a tendency for\nsources depolarized between 1400 and 150 MHz to have flatter spectra over that\nfrequency range than those that remain polarized at 150 MHz.

Three types of bond rearrangement reactions are found by MD\nsimulations at 3000 K in odd fullerenes which contain an extra sp atom among\nall other sp$^2$ atoms. The first type is sto-chastic sp-defect migration\nanalogous to exchange mechanism of adatom migration on a surface. The second\ntype cor-responds to changes in the ring configuration of the sp$^2$-structure\nassisted by the sp atom which can lead to annealing of seven-membered rings or\nseparation of five-membered rings. The third type is formation of short-living\none-coordinated atoms or two additional sp atoms. Annihilation of a pair of sp\ndefects has been also observed in the MD simulations. It is shown that the\nfrequency of sp-defect migration at a lower temperature, as estimated from\nperformed density functional theory calculations of the barriers of sp-defect\nmigration events, is sufficient to deliver the sp atom to defects of sp$^2$\nstructure during the fullerene formation time.

The third is the addition of a skip concatenation with\ntransposed convolution within a feature pyramid network. The proposed BPMSegNet\nis evaluated by conducting experiments on our constructed Ultrasound Brachial\nPlexus Dataset (UBPD).

Current models learn pose encoding from an image\nusing deep convolutional networks which are trained per scene. The resulting\nencoding is typically passed to a multi-layer perceptron in order to regress\nthe pose. In this work, we propose that scene-specific pose encoders are not\nrequired for pose regression and that encodings trained for visual similarity\ncan be used instead. In order to test our hypothesis, we take a shallow\narchitecture of several fully connected layers and train it with pre-computed\nencodings from a generic image retrieval model. We find that these encodings\nare not only sufficient to regress the camera pose, but that, when provided to\na branching fully connected architecture, a trained model can achieve\ncompetitive results and even surpass current \\textit{state-of-the-art} pose\nregressors in some cases. Moreover, we show that for outdoor localization, the\nproposed architecture is the only pose regressor, to date, consistently\nlocalizing in under 2 meters and 5 degrees.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Dec 2020 13:59:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-23"}

Based on the\nidea that dissipation in fully developed turbulence is by singular events\nresulting from an evolution described by the Euler equations, it has been\nrecently observed that the closure problem is strongly restricted, and that it\nimplies that the turbulent stress is a non local function in space of the\naverage velocity field, a kind of extension of classical Boussinesq theory of\nturbulent viscosity. This leads to rather complex nonlinear integral\nequation(s) for the time averaged velocity field. This one satisfies some\nsymmetries of the Euler equations. Such symmetries were used by Prandtl and\nLandau to make various predictions about the shape of the turbulent domain in\nsimple geometries. We explore specifically the case of mixing layer for which\nthe average velocity field only depends on the angle in the wedge behind the\nsplitter plate. This solution yields a pressure difference between the two\nsides of the splitter which contributes to the lift felt by the plate.\nMoreover, because of the structure of the equations for the turbulent stress,\none can satisfy the Cauchy-Schwarz inequalities, also called the realizability\nconditions, for this turbulent stress. Such realizability conditions cannot be\nsatisfied with a simple turbulent viscosity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Dec 2020 14:46:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-14"}

We leverage generative\nadversarial networks (GANs) to accurately estimate frequency selective channels\nwith few pilots at low SNR. The proposed estimator first learns to produce\nchannel samples from the true but unknown channel distribution via training the\ngenerative network, and then uses this trained network as a prior to estimate\nthe current channel by optimizing the network's input vector in light of the\ncurrent received signal. Our results show that at an SNR of -5 dB, even if a\ntransceiver with one-bit phase shifters is employed, our design achieves the\nsame channel estimation error as an LS estimator with SNR = 20 dB or the LMMSE\nestimator at 2.5 dB, both with fully digital architectures.

To date, conventional detectors such as photomultipliers, avalanche\nphotodiodes, and superconducting nanowires, all rely at their core on linear\nexcitation of bound electrons with light, posing fundamental restrictions on\nthe detection. In contrast, the interaction of free electrons with light in the\ncontext of quantum optics is highly nonlinear and offers exciting\npossibilities. The first experiments that promoted this direction appeared over\nthe past decade as part of photon-induced nearfield electron microscopy\n(PINEM), wherein free electrons are capable of high-order multi-photon\nabsorption and emission. Here we propose using free electrons for\nquantum-optical detection of the complete quantum state of light. We show how\nthe precise control of the electron before and after its interaction with\nquantum light enables to extract the photon statistics and implement full\nquantum state tomography using PINEM. This technique can reach sub-attosecond\ntime resolutions, measure temporal coherence of any degree (e.g., g(1), g(2)),\nand simultaneously detect large numbers of photons with each electron.\nImportantly, the interaction of the electron with light is non-destructive,\nthereby leaving the photonic state (modified by the interaction) intact, which\nis conceptually different from conventional detectors. By using a pulse of\nmultiple electrons, we envision how PINEM quantum detectors could achieve a\nsingle-shot measurement of the complete state of quantum light, even for\nnon-reproducible emission events. Altogether, our work paves the way to novel\nkinds of photodetectors that utilize the ultrafast duration, high nonlinearity,\nand non-destructive nature of electron-light interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Dec 2020 14:59:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-23"}

While nonlinearity can provide a rich\nenvironment where the chaotic power exchange among thousands of modes can lead\nto novel behaviors, at the same time, it poses a major challenge in terms of\nunderstanding and harnessing these processes to advantage. Over the years,\nstatistical models have been developed to macroscopically describe the response\nof these complex systems. One of the cornerstones of these theoretical\nformalisms is the prediction of a photon-photon mediated thermalization process\nthat leads to a Rayleigh-Jeans distribution of mode occupations. Here we report\nthe use of mode-resolved measurement techniques to make the first direct\nobservations of thermalization to a Rayleigh-Jeans power distribution in a\nmultimode optical fiber. We experimentally demonstrate that the underlying\nsystem Hamiltonian remains invariant during propagation while power\nequipartition takes place among degenerate groups of modes - all in full accord\nwith theoretical predictions.

The coupling mechanism in\nsuch a system is supposed to be of activation type, with the recovery rate\ngoverned by the Arrhenius-like law. In this case, economic resource formally\nplays the role of effective market temperature and the minimum level of\nresource consumption is associated with activation energy. Such a coupling can\nresult in the collapsing effect opposite to thermal explosion, so that the\nepidemic could ultimately drive the system to a collapse at nonzero activation\nenergy because of the limited resource. In this case, the system can no longer\nstabilize and return to the stable pre-epidemic state or a poorer post-epidemic\nstate. We demonstrate that the system's collapse can partially be mitigated by\nexternal subsidies meaning constant resource inflow from some external source\nor by means of debt interpreted as a negative resource. We also consider a\nsimple quarantine scenario and show that it can lead to different socioeconomic\noutcomes, depending on initial resource (market temperature) and the minimum\nlevel of resource consumption (activation energy).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Dec 2020 15:49:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-23"}

When integrated over long optical path lengths,\namplitude aberrations (seen as scintillation) can nullify local areas in the\nrecorded image of a coherent beam, complicating the wavefront reconstruction\nprocess. To estimate phase aberrations experienced by a telescope beam control\nsystem in the presence of strong turbulence, the wavefront sensor (WFS) of an\nadaptive optics must be robust to scintillation. We have designed and built a\nWFS, which we refer to as a \"Fresnel sensor,\" that uses near-field diffraction\nto measure phase errors under moderate to strong turbulent conditions.\nSystematic studies of its sensitivity were performed with laboratory\nexperiments using a point source beacon. The results were then compared to a\nShack-Hartmann WFS (SHWFS). When the SHWFS experiences irradiance fade in the\npresence of moderate turbulence, the Fresnel WFS continues to routinely extract\nphase information. For a scintillation index of $S = 0.55$, we show that the\nFresnel WFS offers a factor of $9\\times$ gain in sensitivity over the SHWFS.

Why can we use relatively vanilla gradient descent algorithms\n(e.g., without strong regularization) to tune a model with hundreds of millions\nof parameters on datasets with only hundreds or thousands of labeled examples?\nIn this paper, we argue that analyzing fine-tuning through the lens of\nintrinsic dimension provides us with empirical and theoretical intuitions to\nexplain this remarkable phenomenon. We empirically show that common pre-trained\nmodels have a very low intrinsic dimension; in other words, there exists a low\ndimension reparameterization that is as effective for fine-tuning as the full\nparameter space. For example, by optimizing only 200 trainable parameters\nrandomly projected back into the full space, we can tune a RoBERTa model to\nachieve 90\\% of the full parameter performance levels on MRPC. Furthermore, we\nempirically show that pre-training implicitly minimizes intrinsic dimension\nand, perhaps surprisingly, larger models tend to have lower intrinsic dimension\nafter a fixed number of pre-training updates, at least in part explaining their\nextreme effectiveness. Lastly, we connect intrinsic dimensionality with low\ndimensional task representations and compression based generalization bounds to\nprovide intrinsic-dimension-based generalization bounds that are independent of\nthe full parameter count.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Dec 2020 07:42:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-25"}

Such models often assume a particular\nnetwork-generating mechanism, which when fit to data produces estimates of\nmechanism-specific parameters that describe how systems function. For instance,\na social network model might assume new individuals connect to others with\nprobability proportional to their number of pre-existing connections\n('preferential attachment'), and then estimate the disparity in interactions\nbetween famous and obscure individuals with similar qualifications. However,\nwithout a means of testing the relevance of the assumed mechanism, conclusions\nfrom such models could be misleading. Here we introduce a simple empirical\napproach which can mechanistically classify arbitrary network data. Our\napproach compares empirical networks to model networks from a user-provided\ncandidate set of mechanisms, and classifies each network--with high\naccuracy--as originating from either one of the mechanisms or none of them. We\ntested 373 empirical networks against five of the most widely studied network\nmechanisms and found that most (228) were unlike any of these mechanisms. This\nraises the possibility that some empirical networks arise from mixtures of\nmechanisms. We show that mixtures are often unidentifiable because different\nmixtures can produce functionally equivalent networks. In such systems, which\nare governed by multiple mechanisms, our approach can still accurately predict\nout-of-sample functional properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Dec 2020 01:41:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 4 Jan 2021 16:57:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-17"}

The majority of existing approaches focuses\non completed process executions, i.e., offline conformance checking. Recently,\nnovel approaches have been designed to monitor ongoing processes, i.e., online\nconformance checking. Such techniques detect deviations of an ongoing process\nexecution from a normative process model at the moment they occur. Thereby,\ncountermeasures can be taken immediately to prevent a process deviation from\ncausing further, undesired consequences. Most online approaches only allow to\ndetect approximations of deviations. This causes the problem of falsely\ndetected deviations, i.e., detected deviations that are actually no deviations.\nWe have, therefore, recently introduced a novel approach to compute exact\nconformance checking results in an online environment. In this paper, we focus\non the practical application and present a scalable, distributed implementation\nof the proposed online conformance checking approach.
