We run our simulations with the software snmachine, a\nphotometric classification pipeline using machine learning. The\nmachine-learning algorithms struggle to classify supernovae when the training\nsample is magnitude-limited, in contrast to representative training samples.\nClassification performance noticeably improves when we combine the\nmagnitude-limited training sample with a simulated realistic sample of faint,\nhigh-redshift supernovae observed from larger spectroscopic facilities; the\nalgorithms' range of average area under ROC curve (AUC) scores over 10 runs\nincreases from 0.547-0.628 to 0.946-0.969 and purity of the classified sample\nreaches 95 per cent in all runs for 2 of the 4 algorithms. By creating new,\nartificial light curves using the augmentation software avocado, we achieve a\npurity in our classified sample of 95 per cent in all 10 runs performed for all\nmachine-learning algorithms considered. We also reach a highest average AUC\nscore of 0.986 with the artificial neural network algorithm. Having `true'\nfaint supernovae to complement our magnitude-limited sample is a crucial\nrequirement in optimisation of a 4MOST spectroscopic sample. However, our\nresults are a proof of concept that augmentation is also necessary to achieve\nthe best classification results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Dec 2020 16:03:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Aug 2021 13:20:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 24 Sep 2021 14:22:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-27"}

In a by-now classical paper, Beeri, Fagin, Maier, and\nYannakakis established several different equivalent characterizations of\nacyclicity; in particular, they showed that the sets of attributes of a schema\nform an acyclic hypergraph if and only if the local-to-global consistency\nproperty for relations over that schema holds, which means that every\ncollection of pairwise consistent relations over the schema is globally\nconsistent. Even though real-life databases consist of bags (multisets), there\nhas not been a study of the interplay between local consistency and global\nconsistency for bags. We embark on such a study here and we first show that the\nsets of attributes of a schema form an acyclic hypergraph if and only if the\nlocal-to global consistency property for bags over that schema holds. After\nthis, we explore algorithmic aspects of global consistency for bags by\nanalyzing the computational complexity of the global consistency problem for\nbags: given a collection of bags, are these bags globally consistent? We show\nthat this problem is in NP, even when the schema is part of the input. We then\nestablish the following dichotomy theorem for fixed schemas: if the schema is\nacyclic, then the global consistency problem for bags is solvable in polynomial\ntime, while if the schema is cyclic, then the global consistency problem for\nbags is NP-complete. The latter result contrasts sharply with the state of\naffairs for relations, where, for each fixed schema, the global consistency\nproblem for relations is solvable in polynomial time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Dec 2020 16:04:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-23"}

In particular, we show that for the constrained best approximation of\nthe Lebesgue measure by a discrete measure, the discrete measure whose support\nis a triangular lattice is asymptotically optimal.

While causal inference requires randomized\nexperiments, researchers and policymakers are increasingly using observational\nstudies to test causal hypotheses due to the wide availability of observational\ndata and the infeasibility of experiments. The matching method is the most used\ntechnique to make causal inference from observational data. However, the pair\nassignment process in one-to-one matching creates uncertainty in the inference\nbecause of different choices made by the experimenter. Recently, discrete\noptimization models are proposed to tackle such uncertainty. Although a robust\ninference is possible with discrete optimization models, they produce nonlinear\nproblems and lack scalability. In this work, we propose greedy algorithms to\nsolve the robust causal inference test instances from observational data with\ncontinuous outcomes. We propose a unique framework to reformulate the nonlinear\nbinary optimization problems as feasibility problems. By leveraging the\nstructure of the feasibility formulation, we develop greedy schemes that are\nefficient in solving robust test problems. In many cases, the proposed\nalgorithms achieve global optimal solutions. We perform experiments on three\nreal-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms\nand compare our result with the state-of-the-art solver. Our experiments show\nthat the proposed algorithms significantly outperform the exact method in terms\nof computation time while achieving the same conclusion for causal tests.

This requires that the algorithm controlling the ship is able to\naccount for the vessel's dynamics, and obeys the rules specified in the\ninternational regulations for preventing collision at sea (COLREGs). To account\nfor these properties, this work proposes a two-step optimization-based and\nCOLREGs-compliant motion planner tailored for large vessels. In the first step,\na lattice-based motion planner is used to compute a suboptimal trajectory based\non a library of precomputed motion primitives. To comply with the rules\nspecified in COLREGs, the lattice-based planner is augmented with discrete\nstates that represent what type of COLREGs situations that are active with\nrespect to other nearby vessels. The trajectory computed by the lattice-based\nplanner is then used as warm-start for the second receding-horizon step based\non direct optimal control techniques. The aim of the second step is to solve\nthe problem to local optimality with the discrete COLREGs states remained\nfixed. The applicability of the proposed motion planner is demonstrated in\nsimulations, where it computes energy-efficient and COLREGs-compliant\ntrajectories.

Central to this ZT\nimprovement is the drastic reduction in the material thermal conductivity due\nto the scattering of phonons on the numerous interfaces, boundaries,\ndislocations, point defects, phases, etc., which are purposely included. In\nthese new generation of nanostructured materials, phonon scattering centers of\ndifferent sizes and geometrical configurations (atomic, nano- and macro-scale)\nare formed, which are able to scatter phonons of mean-free-paths across the\nspectrum. Beyond thermal conductivity reductions, ideas are beginning to emerge\non how to use similar hierarchical nanostructuring to achieve power factor\nimprovements. Ways that relax the adverse interdependence of the electrical\nconductivity and Seebeck coefficient are targeted, which allows power factor\nimprovements.

Photoresponse in these devices is typically caused by a\ncombination of two physical mechanisms: photoconductive effect (PCE) and\nphotogating effect (PGE). In earlier literature for monolayer (1L) MoS2\nphototransistors PGE is generally attributed to charge trapping by polar\nmolecules adsorbed to the semiconductor channel, giving rise to a very slow\nphotoresponse. Thus, the photoresponse of 1L-MoS2 phototransistors at\nhigh-frequency light modulation is assigned to PCE alone. Here we investigate\nthe photoresponse of a fully h-BN encapsulated monolayer (1L) MoS2\nphototransistor. In contrast with previous understanding, we identify a rapidly\nresponding PGE mechanism that becomes the dominant contribution to\nphotoresponse under high-frequency light modulation. Using a Hornbeck-Haynes\nmodel for the photocarrier dynamics, we fit the illumination power dependence\nof this PGE and estimate the energy level of the involved traps.

Although the read-retry mechanism is\nessential to ensuring the reliability of modern NAND flash memory, it can\nsignificantly increase the read latency of an SSD by introducing multiple retry\nsteps that read the target page again with adjusted read-reference voltage\nvalues. Through a detailed analysis of the read mechanism and rigorous\ncharacterization of 160 real 3D NAND flash memory chips, we find new\nopportunities to reduce the read-retry latency by exploiting two advanced\nfeatures widely adopted in modern NAND flash-based SSDs: 1) the CACHE READ\ncommand and 2) strong ECC engine. First, we can reduce the read-retry latency\nusing the advanced CACHE READ command that allows a NAND flash chip to perform\nconsecutive reads in a pipelined manner. Second, there exists a large\nECC-capability margin in the final retry step that can be used for reducing the\nchip-level read latency. Based on our new findings, we develop two new\ntechniques that effectively reduce the read-retry latency: 1) Pipelined\nRead-Retry (PR$^2$) and 2) Adaptive Read-Retry (AR$^2$).

Such\nnetworks are well suited for FPGAs, as their dominant computations are bitwise\narithmetic and the memory requirement is also significantly reduced. However,\ncompared to start-of-the-art compact convolutional neural network (CNN) models,\nBNNs tend to produce a much lower accuracy on realistic datasets such as\nImageNet. In addition, the input layer of BNNs has gradually become a major\ncompute bottleneck, because it is conventionally excluded from binarization to\navoid a large accuracy loss. This work proposes FracBNN, which exploits\nfractional activations to substantially improve the accuracy of BNNs.\nSpecifically, our approach employs a dual-precision activation scheme to\ncompute features with up to two bits, using an additional sparse binary\nconvolution. We further binarize the input layer using a novel thermometer\nencoding. Overall, FracBNN preserves the key benefits of conventional BNNs,\nwhere all convolutional layers are computed in pure binary MAC operations\n(BMACs). We design an efficient FPGA-based accelerator for our novel BNN model\nthat supports the fractional activations. To evaluate the performance of\nFracBNN under a resource-constrained scenario, we implement the entire\noptimized network architecture on an embedded FPGA (Xilinx Ultra96v2). Our\nexperiments on ImageNet show that FracBNN achieves an accuracy comparable to\nMobileNetV2, surpassing the best-known BNN design on FPGAs with an increase of\n28.9% in top-1 accuracy and a 2.5x reduction in model size. FracBNN also\noutperforms a recently introduced BNN model with an increase of 2.4% in top-1\naccuracy while using the same model size.

Empirical data in modern European countries support\nsuch universality but are consistent with a larger exponent.

Learning discriminative\nrepresentations of local geometric features is unquestionably the most\nimportant task for accurate point cloud analyses. However, it is challenging to\ndevelop rotation or scale-invariant descriptors. Most previous studies have\neither ignored rotations or empirically studied optimal scale parameters, which\nhinders the applicability of the methods for real-world datasets. In this\npaper, we present a new local feature description method that is robust to\nrotation, density, and scale variations. Moreover, to improve representations\nof the local descriptors, we propose a global aggregation method. First, we\nplace kernels aligned around each point in the normal direction. To avoid the\nsign problem of the normal vector, we use a symmetric kernel point distribution\nin the tangential plane. From each kernel point, we first projected the points\nfrom the spatial space to the feature space, which is robust to multiple scales\nand rotation, based on angles and distances. Subsequently, we perform graph\nconvolutions by considering local kernel point structures and long-range global\ncontext, obtained by a global aggregation method. We experimented with our\nproposed descriptors on benchmark datasets (i.e., ModelNet40 and ShapeNetPart)\nto evaluate the performance of registration, classification, and part\nsegmentation on 3D point clouds.

Knowledge tracing (KT) refers to the detection of students'\nknowledge states and predict future performance given their past outcomes for\nproviding adaptive solution to Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS). Bayesian\nKnowledge Tracing (BKT) is a model to capture mastery level of each skill with\npsychologically meaningful parameters and widely used in successful tutoring\nsystems. However, it is unable to detect learning transfer across skills\nbecause each skill model is learned independently and shows lower efficiency in\nstudent performance prediction. While recent KT models based on deep neural\nnetworks shows impressive predictive power but it came with a price. Ten of\nthousands of parameters in neural networks are unable to provide\npsychologically meaningful interpretation that reflect to cognitive theory.

A\nmaterial that has recently attracted attention in research to reduce noise is\nacoustic metamaterial, and most of the research projects so far have been\nlimited to the case of static media without flow. We have studied the sound\ntransmission properties of acoustic metamaterial with turbulent flow to develop\nacoustic metamaterial that be used in transportation. In this paper, the effect\nof geometrical structure, the convective effect, and the eddy effect on sound\npropagation in acoustic metamaterial with turbulent flow are investigated, and\nthe relationships between them are analyzed. The convective effect and the eddy\neffect both reduce the resonant strength of sound transmission loss resulting\nfrom the unique geometry of the acoustic crystal, but shift the resonant\nfrequencies in opposite directions. In addition, when the convective effect and\nthe eddy effect of the airflow, as well as the intrinsic interaction effect\ngenerated from the unique geometrical structure of the acoustic metamaterial\ncannot be ignored, they exhibit competition phenomena with each other,\nresulting in a widening of the resonance peak. As a result, these three effects\ncause the shift of the resonance frequency of the sound transmission loss and\nthe widening of the resonance peak. The results of this study show that even in\nthe case of turbulent flow, acoustic metamaterial can be used for\ntransportation by properly controlling the geometric size and shape of the\nacoustic metamaterial.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Dec 2020 18:15:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-13"}

Solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) for electron-hole\npairs usually yields accurate predictions of absorption spectra, but it is\ncomputationally expensive, especially if thermal averages of spectra computed\nfor multiple configurations are required. We present a method based on machine\nlearning to evaluate a key quantity entering the definition of absorption\nspectra: the dielectric screening. We show that our approach yields a model for\nthe screening that is transferable between multiple configurations sampled\nduring first principles molecular dynamics simulations; hence it leads to a\nsubstantial improvement in the efficiency of calculations of finite temperature\nspectra. We obtained computational gains of one to two orders of magnitude for\nsystems with 50 to 500 atoms, including liquids, solids, nanostructures, and\nsolid/liquid interfaces. Importantly, the models of dielectric screening\nderived here may be used not only in the solution of the BSE but also in\ndeveloping functionals for time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT)\ncalculations of homogeneous and heterogeneous systems.

Half of the\nelongated stream of debris comes back to the stellar pericenter where\nrelativistic apsidal precession induces a self-crossing shock. As a result, the\ngas gets launched into an outflow that can experience additional interactions,\nleading to the formation of an accretion disc. We carry out the first\nradiation-hydrodynamics simulations of this process, making use of the same\ninjection procedure to treat the self-crossing shock as in our previous\nadiabatic study (Bonnerot & Lu 2020). Two sets of realistic parameters of the\nproblem are considered that correspond to different strengths of this initial\ninteraction. In both cases, we find that the injected matter has its\ntrajectories promptly circularized by secondary shocks taking place near the\nblack hole. However, the generated internal energy efficiently diffuses away in\nthe form of radiation, which results in a thin vertical profile of the formed\ndisc. The diffusing photons promptly irradiate the surrounding debris until\nthey emerge with a bolometric luminosity of $L\\approx 10^{44} \\, \\rm erg\\,\ns^{-1}$. Towards the self-crossing shock, diffusion is however slowed that\nresults in a shallower luminosity increase, with a potentially significant\ncomponent in the optical band. Matter launched to large distances continuously\ngains energy through radiation pressure, which can cause a significant fraction\nto become unbound.

Thus, we will\nanalyze the finite temperature pseudo-transition property observed in some\none-dimensional models and its relationship with finite size effect. In\nparticular, we consider two chain models to study the finite size effects;\nthese are the Ising-Heisenberg tetrahedral chain and an Ising-Heisenberg-type\nladder model. Although the anomalous peaks of these one-dimensional models have\nalready been studied in the thermodynamic limit, here we will discuss the\nfinite size effects of the chain and why the peaks do not diverge in the\nthermodynamic limit. So, we discuss the dependence of the finite size effects,\nfor moderately and sufficiently large systems, in which the specific heat and\nmagnetic susceptibility exhibit peculiar rounded towering peaks for a given\ntemperature. This behavior is quite similar to a continuous phase transition,\nbut there is no singularity. For moderately large systems, the peaks narrow and\nincrease in height as the number of unit cells is increased, and the location\nof peak shifts slightly. Hence, one can naively induce that the sharp peak\nshould lead to a divergence in the thermodynamic limit. However, for a rather\nlarge system, the height of a peak goes asymptotically to a finite value. Our\nresult confirms the dependence of the peak height with the number of unit cells\nat the pseudo-critical temperature. We also provide an alternative empirical\nfunction that satisfactorily fits specific heat and magnetic susceptibility at\npseudo-critical temperature. Certainly, our result is crucial to understand the\nfinite size correction behavior in quantum spin models, which in general are\nonly numerically tractable within the framework of the finite size analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Dec 2020 19:20:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-24"}

We found\nthat the peak to peak amplitude of the solar photocentre displacement would\nreach 0.5 mas if the Sun were located 10 pc away from the observer and observed\nin the Gaia G filter. This is by far too small to be detected by the Gaia\nmission. However, the Sun is a relatively inactive star so that one can expect\nsignificantly larger signals for younger, and, consequently, more active stars.\nThe model developed in this study can be combined with the simulations of\nemergence and surface transport of magnetic flux which have recently became\navailable to model the astrometric jitter over the broad range of magnetic\nactivities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Dec 2020 19:33:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-03"}

We identify deficiencies including lack of soundness, i.e., the\nability of a metric to capture a notion accurately as promised by the metric,\nlack of support for assessing software architecture quality, and insufficient\nsupport for assessing software testing and infrastructure. In the second part\nof the paper, we focus on one specific code quality metric-LCOM as a case study\nto explore opportunities towards improved metrics. We evaluate existing LCOM\nalgorithms qualitatively and quantitatively to observe how closely they\nrepresent the concept of cohesion. In this pursuit, we first create eight\ndiverse cases that any LCOM algorithm must cover and obtain their cohesion\nlevels by a set of experienced developers and consider them as a ground truth.\nWe show that the present set of LCOM algorithms do poorly w.r.t. these cases.\nTo bridge the identified gap, we propose a new approach to compute LCOM and\nevaluate the new approach with the ground truth.

Structure-based drug similarities and\nsequence-based target protein similarities are the commonly used information\nfor DTI prediction. Among numerous computational methods, neighborhood-based\nchemogenomic approaches that leverage drug and target similarities to perform\npredictions directly are simple but promising ones. However, existing\nsimilarity-based methods need to be re-trained to predict interactions for any\nnew drugs or targets and cannot directly perform predictions for both new\ndrugs, new targets, and new drug-target pairs. Furthermore, a large amount of\nmissing (undetected) interactions in current DTI datasets hinders most DTI\nprediction methods. To address these issues, we propose a new method denoted as\nWeighted k-Nearest Neighbor with Interaction Recovery (WkNNIR). Not only can\nWkNNIR estimate interactions of any new drugs and/or new targets without any\nneed of re-training, but it can also recover missing interactions (false\nnegatives). In addition, WkNNIR exploits local imbalance to promote the\ninfluence of more reliable similarities on the interaction recovery and\nprediction processes. We also propose a series of ensemble methods that employ\ndiverse sampling strategies and could be coupled with WkNNIR as well as any\nother DTI prediction method to improve performance. Experimental results over\nfive benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches in\npredicting drug-target interactions.

The meaning of\nthe two-particle visibility originally defined by Jaeger, Horne, Shimony, and\nVaidman with the use of an indirect method that first corrects the two-particle\nprobability distribution by adding and subtracting other distributions with\nvarying degree of entanglement, however, deserves further analysis.\nFurthermore, the origin of complementarity between one-particle visibility and\ntwo-particle visibility is somewhat elusive and it is not entirely clear what\nis the best way to associate particular two-particle quantum observables with\nthe two-particle visibility.

The complementarity\nrelation between one-particle visibility and two-particle visibility obtained\nwith the direct method is exact in the limit of infinite Gaussian precision\nwhere the entangled Gaussian state approaches an ideal EPR state.

Under phonon-limited scattering conditions, a considerable\nimprovement of ~6x in the power factor is observed around d = 10 nm. The\nintroduction of surface roughness scattering in the calculation reduces this\npower factor improvement to ~2x. As the diameter is decreased down to d = 3 nm,\nthe power factor is diminished. Our results show that, although low effective\nmass materials such as InAs can reach low-dimensional behavior at larger\ndiameters and demonstrate significant thermoelectric power factor improvements,\nsurface roughness is also stronger at larger diameters, which takes most of the\nanticipated power factor advantages away.

Finally, we exploit quantum connections to a generalization of the\nGrothendieck problem to obtain a classical constant-factor approximation for\nthe physically relevant special case of strictly quadratic traceless 2-Local\nHamiltonians on bipartite interaction graphs, where a inverse logarithmic\napproximation was the best previously known (for general interaction graphs).\nOur work employs recently developed techniques for analyzing classical\napproximations of CSPs and is intended to be accessible to both quantum\ninformation scientists and classical computer scientists.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Dec 2020 20:41:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-16"}

To improve the accessibility of these devices and to enable their usage\nin a variety of settings, building models that can assist users and accomplish\ntasks through the UI is vitally important. However, there are several\nchallenges to achieve this. First, UI components of similar appearance can have\ndifferent functionalities, making understanding their function more important\nthan just analyzing their appearance. Second, domain-specific features like\nDocument Object Model (DOM) in web pages and View Hierarchy (VH) in mobile\napplications provide important signals about the semantics of UI elements, but\nthese features are not in a natural language format. Third, owing to a large\ndiversity in UIs and absence of standard DOM or VH representations, building a\nUI understanding model with high coverage requires large amounts of training\ndata.\n  Inspired by the success of pre-training based approaches in NLP for tackling\na variety of problems in a data-efficient way, we introduce a new pre-trained\nUI representation model called ActionBert. Our methodology is designed to\nleverage visual, linguistic and domain-specific features in user interaction\ntraces to pre-train generic feature representations of UIs and their\ncomponents. Our key intuition is that user actions, e.g., a sequence of clicks\non different UI components, reveals important information about their\nfunctionality. We evaluate the proposed model on a wide variety of downstream\ntasks, ranging from icon classification to UI component retrieval based on its\nnatural language description.

At the level of individual neurons,\nnonlinear dynamics are both experimentally established and essential for\nneuronal functioning. An implicit assumption has thus formed that an accurate\ncomputational model of whole-brain dynamics must also be highly nonlinear,\nwhereas linear models may provide a first-order approximation. Here, we provide\na rigorous and data-driven investigation of this hypothesis at the level of\nwhole-brain blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) and macroscopic field potential\ndynamics by leveraging the theory of system identification.

We assess relative model fit using predictive power,\ncomputational complexity, and the extent of residual dynamics unexplained by\nthe model. Contrary to our expectations, linear auto-regressive models achieve\nthe best measures across all three metrics, eliminating the trade-off between\naccuracy and simplicity. To understand and explain this linearity, we highlight\nfour properties of macroscopic neurodynamics which can counteract or mask\nmicroscopic nonlinear dynamics: averaging over space, averaging over time,\nobservation noise, and limited data samples. Whereas the latter two are\ntechnological limitations and can improve in the future, the former two are\ninherent to aggregated macroscopic brain activity.

Different from\nconventional classification approaches, fair classification concerns the issues\nof unintentional biases against the sensitive features (e.g., gender, race).\nDue to high nonconvexity of fairness measures, existing methods are often\nunable to model exact fairness, which can cause inferior fair classification\noutcomes. This paper fills the gap by developing a novel unified framework to\njointly optimize accuracy and fairness. The proposed framework is versatile and\ncan incorporate different fairness measures studied in literature precisely as\nwell as can be applicable to many classifiers including deep classification\nmodels. Specifically, in this paper, we first prove Fisher consistency of the\nproposed framework. We then show that many classification models within this\nframework can be recast as mixed-integer convex programs, which can be solved\neffectively by off-the-shelf solvers when the instance sizes are moderate and\ncan be used as benchmarks to compare the efficiency of approximation\nalgorithms. We prove that in the proposed framework, when the classification\noutcomes are known, the resulting problem, termed \"unbiased subdata selection,\"\nis strongly polynomial-solvable and can be used to enhance the classification\nfairness by selecting more representative data points. This motivates us to\ndevelop an iterative refining strategy (IRS) to solve the large-scale\ninstances, where we improve the classification accuracy and conduct the\nunbiased subdata selection in an alternating fashion. We study the convergence\nproperty of IRS and derive its approximation bound. More broadly, this\nframework can be leveraged to improve classification models with unbalanced\ndata by taking F1 score into consideration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Dec 2020 21:09:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Dec 2020 05:20:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-25"}

In this case we realize a perfect thermal rectification,\nand we can not find apparent rectification effect for the former interaction.\nFinally and more importantly, our results show that whether this approximation\nis valid or not is closely related to the quantum correlations between the\nsubsystems, i.e., the weaker the quantum correlations, the more justified the\napproximation and vice versa.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2020 09:34:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-28"}

In this paper, we test whether the system cost further decreases when\ntransmission is extended to intercontinental connections. We analyze a Eurasian\ninterconnection between China, Mid-Asia and Europe, using a capacity expansion\nmodel with hourly time resolution. The model is constrained by an increasingly\ntighter global cap on CO2 emissions in order to investigate the effect of\ndifferent levels of reliance on variable sources. Our results show that a\nsupergrid option decreases total system cost by a maximum of 5%, compared to\ncontinental grid integration. This maximum effect is achieved when (i) the\ngeneration is constrained to be made up almost entirely by renewables, (ii) the\nland available for VRE farms is relatively limited and the demand is relatively\nhigh and (iii) the cost for solar PV and storage is high. The importance of\nthese two factors is explained by that a super grid allows for harnessing of\nremote wind-, solar- and hydro resources as well as management of variations,\nboth of which are consequential only in cases where dispatchable resources are\nlimited or very costly. As for the importance of the cost for storage, it\nrepresents a competing variation management option, and when it has low cost,\nit substitutes part of the role of the supergrid, which is to manage variations\nthrough long-distance trade. The cost decrease from a Eurasian supergrid was\nfound to be between 0% and 5%, compared to the cost in the case of\ncontinental-scale grids. We conclude that the benefits of a supergrid from a\ntechno-economic perspective are in most cases negligible, or modest at best.17\npages, f\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Dec 2020 21:33:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-24"}

Adversarial Training (AT) is a technique that\napproximately solves a robust optimization problem to minimize the worst-case\nloss and is widely regarded as the most effective defense. Due to the high\ncomputation time for generating strong adversarial examples in the AT process,\nsingle-step approaches have been proposed to reduce training time. However,\nthese methods suffer from catastrophic overfitting where adversarial accuracy\ndrops during training, and although improvements have been proposed, they\nincrease training time and robustness is far from that of multi-step AT. We\ndevelop a theoretical framework for adversarial training with FW optimization\n(FW-AT) that reveals a geometric connection between the loss landscape and the\n$\\ell_2$ distortion of $\\ell_\\infty$ FW attacks. We analytically show that high\ndistortion of FW attacks is equivalent to small gradient variation along the\nattack path. It is then experimentally demonstrated on various deep neural\nnetwork architectures that $\\ell_\\infty$ attacks against robust models achieve\nnear maximal distortion, while standard networks have lower distortion. It is\nexperimentally shown that catastrophic overfitting is strongly correlated with\nlow distortion of FW attacks. This mathematical transparency differentiates FW\nfrom Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) optimization. To demonstrate the utility\nof our theoretical framework we develop FW-AT-Adapt, a novel adversarial\ntraining algorithm which uses a simple distortion measure to adapt the number\nof attack steps during training to increase efficiency without compromising\nrobustness. FW-AT-Adapt provides training time on par with single-step fast AT\nmethods and closes the gap between fast AT methods and multi-step PGD-AT with\nminimal loss in adversarial accuracy in white-box and black-box settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Dec 2020 21:36:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Feb 2021 17:38:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 15 Jul 2021 15:54:03 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 29 Nov 2021 18:38:45 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 25 Mar 2022 15:54:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-28"}

To address these\nissues, techniques such as Tube MPC (TMPC) utilize an ancillary\noffline-generated robust controller to ensure that the system remains within an\ninvariant set, referred to as a tube, around an online-generated trajectory.\nHowever, TMPC is unable to modify its tube and ancillary controller in response\nto changing state-dependent uncertainty, often resulting in overly-conservative\nsolutions. Dynamic Tube MPC (DTMPC) addresses these problems by simultaneously\noptimizing the desired trajectory and tube geometry online. Building upon this\nframework, Adaptive DTMPC (ADTMPC) produces better model approximations by\nreducing model uncertainty, resulting in more accurate control policies. This\nwork presents an experimental analysis and performance evaluation of TMPC,\nDTMPC, and ADTMPC for an uncertain nonlinear system. In particular, DTMPC is\nshown to outperform TMPC because it is able to dynamically adjust to changing\nenvironments, limiting aggressive control and conservative behavior to only the\ncases when the constraints and uncertainty require it. Applied to a pendulum\ntestbed, this enables DTMPC to use up to 30% less control effort while\nachieving up to 80% higher speeds. This performance is further improved by\nADTMPC, which reduces the feedback control effort by up to another 35%, while\ndelivering up to 34% better trajectory tracking. This analysis establishes that\nthe DTMPC and ADTMPC frameworks yield significantly more effective robust\ncontrol policies for systems with changing uncertainty, goals, and operating\nconditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Dec 2020 23:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-24"}

However, conventional DC and\nmulti-phase AC biasing techniques already encounter serious challenges for\nscaling circuits above several hundred thousand junctions. In this work, we\npropose a novel AC-based biasing scheme for RSFQ-type logic families requiring\nDC bias. The major step toward this scheme is a superconducting AC/DC rectifier\nwhich we introduced at ASC 2014. Initially, we proposed to connect the\nrectifiers to 'payload cells' via superconducting inductors with large\ninductance in order to reduce parasitic effects of flux quantization. Recently,\nwe discovered that this powering scheme works even better at a much lower value\nof the inductance, when it is just sufficient to hold only one or two flux\nquanta in the inductive loop between the converter and the payload. In this\ncase, flux quantization in the loop becomes beneficial because the value of\ncurrent fed into the payload is defined by the value of the coupling\ninductance. Therefore, our AC/SFQ converter powers the payload cell by a single\nflux quantum rather than by DC current. Such mode of operation is extremely\nenergy efficient because the energy is used only to recover flux quantum\nconsumed by the cell during the logic operation. We present designs of AC/SFQ\nconverters comprising an AC/DC rectifier and a current conditioning circuit\nwhich we termed an SFQ filter. We also present test results and demonstrate\nAC/SFQ powering a payload circuit using circuits fabricated in a new, 150-nm\nnode of Lincoln Laboratory fabrication technology using self-shunted\nNb/AlOx-Al/Nb Josephson junctions with 600 $\\mu$A/$\\mu$$m^2$ critical current\ndensity and 200 nm minimum linewidth of inductors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 22 Dec 2020 23:07:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 7 Feb 2021 20:14:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-02"}

Mass-loss rates are traced by infrared colours\nusing 2MASS and WISE and by observed-to-model WISE fluxes, and are also\nestimated using dust mass-loss rates from literature assuming a typical\ngas-to-dust mass ratio of 400. To specify the pulsations, we extract the period\nand height of the highest peak in the power spectrum of oscillation. Absolute\nmagnitudes are obtained from the 2MASS Ks band and the Gaia DR2 parallaxes. Our\nresults follow. (i) Substantial mass loss sets in at pulsation periods above\n~60 and ~100 days, corresponding to Asymptotic-Giant-Branch stars at the base\nof the period-luminosity sequences C' and C. (ii) The mass-loss rate starts to\nrapidly increase in semiregulars for which the luminosity is just above the\nRed-Giant-Branch tip and gradually plateaus to a level similar to that of\nMiras.

The prediction strategy is,\nroughly, that once the dipole intensity drops below a threshold, then the field\nwill continue to decrease and a reversal (or a major excursion) will occur. We\nfirst present a rigorous definition of an intensity threshold-based prediction\nstrategy and then describe a mathematical and numerical framework to\ninvestigate its validity and robustness in view of the data being limited. We\napply threshold-based predictions to a hierarchy of numerical models, ranging\nfrom simple scalar models to 3D geodynamos. We find that the skill of\nthreshold-based predictions varies across the model hierarchy. The differences\nin skill can be explained by differences in how reversals occur: if the field\ndecreases towards a reversal slowly (in a sense made precise in this paper),\nthe skill is high, and if the field decreases quickly, the skill is low. Such a\nproperty could be used as an additional criterion to identify which models\nqualify as Earth-like. Applying threshold-based predictions to Virtual Axial\nDipole Moment (VADM) paleomagnetic reconstructions (PADM2M and Sint-2000)\ncovering the last two million years, reveals a moderate skill of\nthreshold-based predictions for Earth's dynamo. Besides all of their\nlimitations, threshold-based predictions suggest that no reversal is to be\nexpected within the next 10 kyr.

Hence, we proposed a\nhigh-resolution CT retroperitoneal atlas specifically optimized for the kidney\nacross non-contrast CT and early arterial, late arterial, venous and delayed\ncontrast enhanced CT. Briefly, we introduce a deep learning-based volume of\ninterest extraction method and an automated two-stage hierarchal registration\npipeline to register abdominal volumes to a high-resolution CT atlas template.\nTo generate and evaluate the atlas, multi-contrast modality CT scans of 500\nsubjects (without reported history of renal disease, age: 15-50 years, 250\nmales & 250 females) were processed. We demonstrate a stable generalizability\nof the atlas template for integrating the normal kidney variation from small to\nlarge, across contrast modalities and populations with great variability of\ndemographics. The linkage of atlas and demographics provided a better\nunderstanding of the variation of kidney anatomy across populations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2020 01:03:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Dec 2020 01:44:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-25"}

Ternary nitride materials, with many possible metastable\npolymorphs, provide a rich materials space to study what influences\nthermodynamic stability and polymorph synthesizability. For example, ZnZrN2 is\ntheoretically predicted at zero Kelvin to have an unusual layered \"wurtsalt\"\nground state crystal structure with compelling optoelectronic properties, but\nit is unknown whether this structure can be realized experimentally under\npractical synthesis conditions. Here, we use combinatorial sputtering to\nsynthesize hundreds of ZnxZr1-xNy thin film samples, and find metastable\nrocksalt-derived or boron-nitride-derived structures rather than the predicted\nwurtsalt structure. Using a statistical polymorph sampler approach, it is\ndemonstrated that although rocksalt is the least stable polymorph at zero\nKelvin, it becomes the most stable polymorph at high effective temperatures\nsimilar to those achieved using this sputter deposition method, and thus\ncorroborates experimental results. Additional calculations show that this\ndestabilization of the wurtsalt polymorph is due to configurational entropic\nand enthalpic effects, and that vibrational contributions are negligible.\nSpecifically, rocksalt- and boron-nitride-derived structures become the most\nstable polymorphs in the presence of disorder because of higher tolerances to\ncation cross-substitution and off-stoichiometry than the wurtsalt structure.\nThis understanding of the role of disorder tolerance in the synthesis of\ncompeting polymorphs can enable more accurate predictions of synthesizable\ncrystal structures and their achievable material properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2020 02:31:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Aug 2021 21:30:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 12 Mar 2022 03:02:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-15"}

Due to interference, the rate\nof packet depletion at any given node is entangled with both the spatial\nconfigurations, which determine the path loss, and temporal dynamics, which\ninfluence the active states, of the other transmitters, resulting in the queues\nto interact with each other in both space and time over the entire network. To\nthat end, variants in the packet update frequency affect not just the\ninter-arrival time but also the departure process, and the impact of such\nphenomena on the AoI is not well understood. In this paper, we establish a\ntheoretical framework to characterize the AoI performance in the aforementioned\nsetting. Particularly, tractable expressions are derived for both the peak and\naverage AoI under two different transmission protocols, namely the FCFS and the\nLCFS-PR. Based on the theoretical outcomes, we find that: i) networks operating\nunder LCFS-PR are able to attain smaller values of peak and average AoI than\nthat under FCFS, whereas the gain is more pronounced when the infrastructure is\ndensely deployed, ii) in sparsely deployed networks, ALOHA with a universally\ndesigned channel access probability is not instrumental in reducing the AoI,\nthus calling for more advanced channel access approaches, and iii) when the\ninfrastructure is densely rolled out, there exists a non-trivial ALOHA channel\naccess probability that minimizes the peak and average AoI under both FCFS and\nLCFS-PR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2020 03:57:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-24"}

Only one label is provided at a time, and the model has to figure out\nthe other label if it has already learnfed it. This setup is more aligned with\nreal-life scenarios, where a learner usually interacts with the same family of\nentities multiple times, discovers more granularity about them, while still\ntrying not to forget previous knowledge. Moreover, this setup enables\nevaluating models for some important lifelong learning challenges that cannot\nbe easily addressed under the existing setups. These challenges can be\nmotivated by the example \"if a model was trained on the class bear in one task\nand on polar bear in another task, will it forget the concept of bear, will it\nrightfully infer that a polar bear is still a bear? and will it wrongfully\nassociate the label of polar bear to other breeds of bear?\".

Specifically, we simulate time series from simple data\ngenerating processes (DGP), such as Auto Regressive (AR) and Seasonal AR, to\ncomplex DGPs, such as Chaotic Logistic Map, Self-Exciting Threshold\nAuto-Regressive, and Mackey-Glass Equations. The data heterogeneity is\nintroduced by mixing time series generated from several DGPs into a single\ndataset. The lengths and the number of series in the dataset are varied in\ndifferent scenarios.

This is\nachieved using a model for the quasi-two-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic flow\nin a duct with moving lateral walls and an orthogonal magnetic field. In this\nenvironment, conventional subcritical routes to turbulence, which are highly\nthree-dimensional, are prohibited. To elucidate the remaining mechanisms\ninvolved in quasi-two-dimensional turbulent transitions, the magnetic field\nstrength and degree of antisymmetry in the base flow are varied, the latter via\nthe relative motion of the lateral duct walls. Introduction of any amount of\nantisymmetry to the base flow drives the critical Reynolds number infinite, as\nthe TS instabilities take on opposite signs of rotation, and destructively\ninterfere. However, an increasing magnetic field strength limits interaction\nbetween the instabilities, permitting finite critical Reynolds numbers.

Often, many probabilistic forecast systems\nare available while evaluations of their performance are not standardized, with\ndifferent scoring rules being used to measure different aspects of forecast\nperformance. Even when the discussion is restricted to strictly proper scoring\nrules, there remains considerable variability between them; indeed strictly\nproper scoring rules need not rank competing forecast systems in the same order\nwhen none of these systems are perfect. The locality property is explored to\nfurther distinguish scoring rules.

The DSDL provides a\nsimple but elegant way to exploit and reconcile the label, semantic and visual\nspaces simultaneously via conducting the dictionary learning among them.\nMoreover, inspired by iterative optimization of traditional dictionary\nlearning, we further devise a novel training strategy named Alternately\nParameters Update Strategy (APUS) for optimizing DSDL, which alternately\noptimizes the representation coefficients and the semantic dictionary in\nforward and backward propagation.

This occurs when pebbles drifting in from the\nouter disk and entering a dead zone experience a decrease in vertical\nturbulence. The scale height of the pebble subdisk then decreases, and for\nsmall enough values of the turbulence in the dead zone and high values of the\npebble to gas flux ratio, the back-reaction of pebbles on gas leads to a\nsignificant decrease in their drift velocity and thus their progressive\naccumulation.

In this paper, we sum up five\nshortcomings of center loss and solved all of them by proposing a dual distance\ncenter loss (DDCL). Especially we solve the shortcoming that center loss must\ncombine with the softmax loss to supervise training the model, which provides\nus with a new perspective to examine the center loss. In addition, we verify\nthe inconsistency between the proposed DDCL and softmax loss in the feature\nspace, which makes the center loss no longer be limited by the softmax loss in\nthe feature space after removing the softmax loss. To be specifically, we add\nthe Pearson distance on the basis of the Euclidean distance to the same center,\nwhich makes all features of the same class be confined to the intersection of a\nhypersphere and a hypercube in the feature space. The proposed Pearson distance\nstrengthens the intra-class compactness of the center loss and enhances the\ngeneralization ability of center loss. Moreover, by designing a Euclidean\ndistance threshold between all center pairs, which not only strengthens the\ninter-class separability of center loss, but also makes the center loss (or\nDDCL) works well without the combination of softmax loss. We apply DDCL in the\nfield of vehicle re-identification named VeRi-776 dataset and VehicleID\ndataset. And in order to verify its good generalization ability, we also verify\nit in two datasets commonly used in the field of person re-identification named\nMSMT17 dataset and Market1501 dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2020 07:14:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-24"}

We demonstrate that for certain\nexperimental geometry nonresonant corrections could be significant for the\ndetermination of Rydberg constant and proton charge radius.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2020 08:21:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-03"}

Our contribution is two-fold: first,\nwe propose a model that has both interpolating and extrapolating capabilities;\nsecond, we propose a guiding mechanism that sequentially generates suggestions\nfor what frame to annotate next, based on the annotations made previously. We\nextensively evaluate our approach on several challenging datasets in simulation\nand demonstrate a reduction in terms of the number of manual bounding boxes\ndrawn by 60% over linear interpolation and by 35% over an off-the-shelf\ntracker. Moreover, we also show 10% annotation time improvement over a\nstate-of-the-art method for video annotation with bounding boxes [25].

Most major financial markets now\ninvolve many \"robot traders\", autonomous adaptive software agents, rather than\nhumans. This paper explores how to give such trader-agents a reliable\nanticipatory sensitivity to block orders, such that markets populated entirely\nby robot traders also show market-impact effects. In a 2019 publication Church\n& Cliff presented initial results from a simple deterministic robot trader,\nISHV, which exhibits this market impact effect via monitoring a metric of\nimbalance between supply and demand in the market. The novel contributions of\nour paper are: (a) we critique the methods used by Church & Cliff, revealing\nthem to be weak, and argue that a more robust measure of imbalance is required;\n(b) we argue for the use of multi-level order-flow imbalance (MLOFI: Xu et al.,\n2019) as a better basis for imbalance-sensitive robot trader-agents; and (c) we\ndemonstrate the use of the more robust MLOFI measure in extending ISHV, and\nalso the well-known AA and ZIP trading-agent algorithms (which have both been\npreviously shown to consistently outperform human traders). We demonstrate that\nthe new imbalance-sensitive trader-agents introduced here do exhibit market\nimpact effects, and hence are better-suited to operating in markets where\nimpact is a factor of concern or interest, but do not suffer the weaknesses of\nthe methods used by Church & Cliff.

Adapted feature learning usually cannot detect\ndomain shifts at the pixel level and is not able to achieve good results in\ndense semantic segmentation tasks. Image appearance translation, e.g. CycleGAN,\ntranslates images into different styles with good appearance, despite its\npopulation, its semantic consistency is hardly to maintain and results in poor\ncross-modality segmentation. In this paper, we propose intra- and\ncross-modality semantic consistency (ICMSC) for UDA and our key insight is that\nthe segmentation of synthesised images in different styles should be\nconsistent. Specifically, our model consists of an image translation module and\na domain-specific segmentation module. The image translation module is a\nstandard CycleGAN, while the segmentation module contains two domain-specific\nsegmentation networks. The intra-modality semantic consistency (IMSC) forces\nthe reconstructed image after a cycle to be segmented in the same way as the\noriginal input image, while the cross-modality semantic consistency (CMSC)\nencourages the synthesized images after translation to be segmented exactly the\nsame as before translation.

By setting an order parameter, we show that the synchronization of\ntwo elevators occurs irrespective of final destination (whether the elevators\ndid or did not go to the top floor). It indicates that the spontaneous ordering\nof elevators emerges from the Poisson noise. We also reproduce the round-trip\ntime of two elevators by a self-consistent equation considering the interaction\nthrough the existence of passengers and the absence of volume exclusion. Those\nresults suggest that such interaction stabilizes and characterizes the\nspontaneous ordering of elevators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2020 09:59:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Dec 2020 09:29:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 30 Mar 2021 07:38:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-14"}

When constructing an\ninstance that avoids one pattern, it is observed that other patterns emerge.\nFor example, repetition emerges when avoiding arithmetic progression (Van der\nWaerden numbers), while reflection emerges when avoiding monochromatic\nsolutions of $a+b=c$ (Schur numbers). We exploit observed patterns when\ncoloring a grid while avoiding monochromatic rectangles.

Central to this drive is the appeal of engineering a\ncomputational system that both discovers and deploys high-performance solutions\nto arbitrary ML problems with minimal human interaction. Beyond this, an even\nloftier goal is the pursuit of autonomy, which describes the capability of the\nsystem to independently adjust an ML solution over a lifetime of changing\ncontexts. However, these ambitions are unlikely to be achieved in a robust\nmanner without the broader synthesis of various mechanisms and theoretical\nframeworks, which, at the present time, remain scattered across numerous\nresearch threads. Accordingly, this review seeks to motivate a more expansive\nperspective on what constitutes an automated/autonomous ML system, alongside\nconsideration of how best to consolidate those elements. In doing so, we survey\ndevelopments in the following research areas: hyperparameter optimisation,\nmulti-component models, neural architecture search, automated feature\nengineering, meta-learning, multi-level ensembling, dynamic adaptation,\nmulti-objective evaluation, resource constraints, flexible user involvement,\nand the principles of generalisation.

Conventional\nmeasurement of these angles suffers from huge variability and low reliability\ndue to intensive manual intervention. However, since there exist high ambiguity\nand variability around boundaries of vertebrae, it is challenging to obtain\nCobb angles automatically. In this paper, we formulate the estimation of the\nCobb angles from spinal X-rays as a multi-output regression task. We propose\nstructured support vector regression (S^2VR) to jointly estimate Cobb angles\nand landmarks of the spine in X-rays in one single framework. The proposed\nS^2VR can faithfully handle the nonlinear relationship between input images and\nquantitative outputs, while explicitly capturing the intrinsic correlation of\noutputs. We introduce the manifold regularization to exploit the geometry of\nthe output space. We propose learning the kernel in S2VR by kernel target\nalignment to enhance its discriminative ability. The proposed method is\nevaluated on the spinal X-rays dataset of 439 scoliosis subjects, which\nachieves the inspiring correlation coefficient of 92.76% with ground truth\nobtained manually by human experts and outperforms two baseline methods.

We investigate the model in three distinct stages of\nevolution: (i) The linear regime, where the ergophage amplitude grows or decays\nexponentially on average, with a randomly fluctuating instantaneous growth\nrate. The growth rate has a small auto-correlation time, and follows a\nprobability distribution featuring a power-law tail with exponent between -2\nand -5/3 (up to a cut-off), depending on the point-vortex base flow.\nConsequently, the logarithmic ergophage amplitude performs a free L\\'evy\nflight.

Therefore, unlike for indoor\nscenes where the scanning effort is mainly devoted to the discovery of boundary\nsurfaces, scanning an open and unbounded area requires actively delimiting the\nextent of scanning region and dynamically planning a traverse path within that\nregion. Thus, for outdoor scenes, we formulate the planning of an\nenergy-efficient autonomous scanning through a discrete-continuous optimization\nof robot scanning paths. The discrete optimization computes a topological map,\nthrough solving an online traveling sales problem (Online TSP), which\ndetermines the scanning goals and paths on-the-fly. The dynamic goals are\ndetermined as a collection of visit sites with high reward of\nvisibility-to-unknown. A visit graph is constructed via connecting the visit\nsites with edges weighted by traversing cost. This topological map evolves as\nthe robot scans via deleting outdated sites that are either visited or become\nrewardless and inserting newly discovered ones. The continuous part optimizes\nthe traverse paths geometrically between two neighboring visit sites via\nmaximizing the information gain of scanning along the paths. The discrete and\ncontinuous processes alternate until the traverse cost of the current graph\nexceeds the remaining energy capacity of the robot. Our approach is evaluated\nwith both synthetic and field tests, demonstrating its effectiveness and\nadvantages over alternatives.

In a\ntime-dependent setting, the gauge-invariant, total current density takes that\nrole. A peculiar feature of the static ground-state setting is, however, that\nthe gauge-dependent paramagnetic current density appears as the additional\nvariable instead. An alternative, exact reformulation in terms of the total\ncurrent density has long been sought but to date a work by Diener is the only\navailable candidate. In that work, an unorthodox variational principle was used\nto establish a ground-state density-functional theory of the total current\ndensity as well as an accompanying Hohenberg-Kohn-like result. We here\nreinterpret and clarify Diener's formulation based on a maximin variational\nprinciple. Using simple facts about convexity implied by the resulting\nvariational expressions, we prove that Diener's formulation is unfortunately\nnot capable of reproducing the correct ground-state energy and, furthermore,\nthat the suggested construction of a Hohenberg-Kohn map contains an irreparable\nmistake.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2020 13:54:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Apr 2021 15:51:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-07"}

One approach aims at tailoring arrays of\nnanomagnetic islands in which the magnetostatic interactions constrain the\nequilibrium orientation of the magnetization to embed logical\nfunctionalities[9-12]. Despite the realization of several proofs of concepts of\nsuch nanomagnetic logic[13-15], it is still unclear what the advantages are\ncompared to the widespread CMOS designs, due to their need for clocking[16, 17]\nand/or thermal annealing [18,19] for which fast convergence to the ground state\nis not guaranteed. In fact, it seems increasingly evident that \"beyond CMOS\"\ntechnology will require a fundamental rethinking of our computing paradigm[20].\nIn this respect, a type of terminal-agnostic logic was suggested[21], where a\ngiven gate is able to \"self-organize\" into its correct logical states,\nregardless of whether the signal is applied to the traditional input terminals,\nor the output terminals.

In the\npresent study, the natural oscillation of a sessile drop on flat surfaces with\nfree contact lines (FCL) is investigated through numerical and theoretical\nanalysis. The FCL condition represents a limit of contact line mobility, i.e.\nthe contact angle remains constant when the contact line moves. In the\nnumerical simulation, the interfaces are captured by the volume-of-fluid method\nand the contact angle at the boundary is specified using the height-function\nmethod. The oscillation frequencies for sessile drops with FCL are mainly\ncontrolled by the contact angle and the Bond number and a parametric study is\ncarried out to characterize their effects on the frequencies for the first and\nhigh-order modes. Particular attention is paid to the frequency of the first\nmode, since it is usually the dominant mode. An inviscid theoretical model for\nthe first mode is developed. The model yields an explicit expression for the\nfirst-mode frequency as a function of the contact angle and the Bond number,\nwith all parameters involved fully determined by the equilibrium drop theory\nand the simulation. The predicted frequencies for a wide range of contact\nangles agree very well with the simulation results for small Bond numbers. The\nfrequencies for both the first and high-order modes decrease with the contact\nangle and increase with the Bond number. For the high-order modes, the\nfrequencies for different modes generally scale with the Rayleigh frequencies.\nThe scaling relation performs better for small Bond numbers and large contact\nangles. A simple model is proposed to predict the frequencies of high-order\nmodes for large contact angles and a good agreement with the simulation results\nis observed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2020 15:13:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-24"}

For the case\nof instantaneous reheating, the resulting strength of the magnetic field at\npresent is too small and violates the observational constraints. However, the\nproblem is solved provided there is a reheating phase with a non-zero e-fold\nnumber. During reheating, the energy density of the magnetic field is seen to\nevolve as $(a^3H)^{-2}$ and, after that, as $a^{-4}$ up to the present epoch\n(here $a$ is the scale factor and $H$ the Hubble parameter). It is found that\nthis reheating phase -- characterized by a certain e-fold number, a constant\nvalue of the equation of state parameter, and a given reheating temperature --\nrenders the magnetogenesis model compatible with the observational constraints.\nThe model provides, in turn, a viable way of constraining the reheating\nequation of state parameter, from data analysis of the cosmic microwave\nbackground radiation.

As the analogue of the chromatic polynomial\n$P(G,m)$, the DP color function of a graph $G$, denoted $P_{DP}(G,m)$, counts\nthe minimum number of DP-colorings over all possible $m$-fold covers. It is\nknown that, unlike the list color function $P_{\\ell}(G,m)$, for any $g \\geq 3$\nthere exists a graph $G$ with girth $g$ such that $P_{DP}(G,m) < P(G,m)$ when\n$m$ is sufficiently large. Thus, two fundamental open questions regarding the\nDP color function are: (i) for which $G$ does there exist an $N \\in \\mathbb{N}$\nsuch that $P_{DP}(G,m) = P(G,m)$ whenever $m \\geq N$, (ii) Given a graph $G$\ndoes there always exist an $N \\in \\mathbb{N}$ and a polynomial $p(m)$ such that\n$P_{DP}(G,m) = p(m)$ whenever $m \\geq N$?\n  In this paper we give exact formulas for the DP color function of a Theta\ngraph based on the parity of its path lengths.

Sample coupon tests using a\ncalibration chamber were conducted for polymer-based PSP (PHFIPM-PSP),\npolymer/ceramic PSP (PC-PSP), and anodized-aluminium PSP (AA-PSP). The oxygen\nmole fraction was set to be between 0.1-100% and the ambient pressure was set\nto be between 0.5-140 kPa. The localized Stern-Volmer coefficient $B_{\\rm\nlocal}$ once increases and then decreases as the oxygen mole fraction\nincreases. The value of $B_{\\rm local}$ depends on both ambient pressure and\noxygen mole fraction, but the effect of this parameter can be characterized as\na function of the partial pressure of oxygen. The value of $B_{\\rm local}$ of\nAA-PSP and PHFIPM-PSP, which are low-pressure type and relatively low-pressure\ntype PSP, have a peak at the relatively low partial pressure of oxygen, and\n$B_{\\rm local}$ of PC-PSP, which are atmospheric pressure type PSP, has a peak\nat the relatively high partial pressure of oxygen. The peak of the intensity\nchange with respect to pressure fluctuation proportional to the ambient\npressure $S_{\\mathcal{PR}}$ appears at the lower partial pressure of oxygen\nthan that of $B_{\\rm local}$.

It introduces the notion of a logic of the mind, where\nneurophysiological data are encoded as logical expressions representing mental\nactivity. Effective logical expressions are likely to be extensive, involving\ndozens of variables. Large expressions require considerable computational power\nto be processed. This is problematic for BCI applications because they require\nfast reaction times to execute sequences of commands. Quantum computers hold\nmuch promise in terms of processing speed for some problems, including those\ninvolving logical expressions. Hence, we propose to use quantum computers to\nprocess the logic of the mind. The chapter begins with an introduction to BCI\nand the electroencephalogram, which is the neurophysiological signal that is\nnormally used in BCI. Then, it briefly discusses how the EEG corresponds to\nmental states, followed by an introduction to the logic of the mind. After\nthat, there is an overview of quantum computing, focusing on the basics deemed\nnecessary to understand how it processes logical expressions. An example of a\nBCI system is presented. In a nutshell, the system reads the EEG and builds\nlogical expressions, which are sent to a quantum computer to solve them. In\nturn, the system converts the results into sounds by means of a bespoke\nsynthesiser. Essentially, the BCI here is a musical instrument controlled by\nthe mind of the player.

However,\nexisting UAV communication and trajectory schemes are inefficient as they\nassume limited drone mobility and static transmission power. Furthermore, they\ntend to rely upon convex approximations to highly non-linear functions and fail\nto adopt a combination of heuristic and convex methods. This paper considers a\nMulti-UAV system where UAV-mounted mobile base stations serve users on the\nground. An iterative approach using block gradient descent is used to jointly\noptimize user scheduling, UAV trajectories, and transmission power for\nmaximizing throughput over all users. Subsequently, an innovative technique for\ninitial trajectory predictions was developed using a K-means clustering\nalgorithm for partitioning users into subgroups and a genetic algorithm for\ninitializing shortest flight paths within clusters. Finally, convex\noptimization solvers such as MATLAB's Fmincon are used for fine-tuning\nparameters. Extensive simulation and optimization results demonstrate a 33.57%,\n87.4%, and 53.2% increase in system throughput for the 1, 2, and 3 UAV\nscenarios respectively when compared to existing trajectory and communication\ndesign schemes. Furthermore, the K-means and genetic algorithm reveal\nadditional improvements in throughput by around 15%. Our results note\ndiminished increases in throughput for increases in UAV trajectory period as\nthe period approaches higher values. Further research into joint adoption of\nconvex and non-convex schemes as well as consideration of environment-dependent\nchannel models would allow for a faster and more optimal deployment of UAVs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 23 Dec 2020 01:04:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-27"}
