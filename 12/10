The simulation study uses survival outcomes and the Cox\nproportional hazards regression as the outcome model. It concludes that using\nthe LASSO for variable selection is preferable to balancing a maximal set of\ncovariates. However, there are no treatment effect modifiers in imbalance in\nthe study. The LASSO is more efficient because it selects a subset of the\nmaximal set of covariates but there are no cross-study imbalances in effect\nmodifiers inducing bias. We highlight the following points: (1) in the anchored\nsetting, MAIC is necessary where there are cross-trial imbalances in effect\nmodifiers; (2) the standard indirect comparison provides greater precision and\naccuracy than MAIC if there are no effect modifiers in imbalance; (3) while the\ntarget estimand of the simulation study is a conditional treatment effect, MAIC\ntargets a marginal or population-average treatment effect; (4) in MAIC,\nvariable selection is a problem of low dimensionality and sparsity-inducing\nmethods like the LASSO may be problematic.

The mechanism applies\nto wormhole and virtual-cut-through, each of them with different advantages.\nNEBB-Hybrid is proposed to employ the best flow control in each situation. The\nmechanism is extended to torus topologies, using FBFC and shared buffers.\n  The proposals have been evaluated using Booksim, showing up to 75% reduction\nof the buffered flits for single-flit packets, which translates into latency\nand dynamic power reductions of up to 30% and 23% respectively.

The effects of wildfires are heterogeneous, meaning that the\nmagnitude of their effects depends on many factors such as geographical region,\nclimate and land cover/vegetation type. Yet, which areas are more affected by\nthese events remains unclear. Here we present a novel application of the\nGeneralised Synthetic Control (GSC) method that enables quantification and\nprediction of vegetation changes due to wildfires through a time-series\nanalysis of in situ and satellite remote sensing data. We apply this method to\nmedium to large wildfires ($>$ 1000 acres) in California throughout a time-span\nof two decades (1996--2016). The method's ability for estimating counterfactual\nvegetation characteristics for burned regions is explored in order to quantify\nabrupt system changes. We find that the GSC method is better at predicting\nvegetation changes than the more traditional approach of using nearby regions\nto assess wildfire impacts. We evaluate the GSC method by comparing its\npredictions of spectral vegetation indices to observations during pre-wildfire\nperiods and find improvements in correlation coefficient from $R^2 = 0.66$ to\n$R^2 = 0.93$ in Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), from $R^2 =\n0.48$ to $R^2 = 0.81$ for Normalised Burn Ratio (NBR), and from $R^2 = 0.49$ to\n$R^2 = 0.85$ for Normalised Difference Moisture Index (NDMI). Results show\ngreater changes in NDVI, NBR, and NDMI post-fire on regions classified as\nhaving a lower Burning Index. The GSC method also reveals that wildfire effects\non vegetation can last for more than a decade post-wildfire, and in some cases\nnever return to their previous vegetation cycles within our study period.\nLastly, we discuss the usefulness of using GSC in remote sensing analyses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2020 16:22:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Dec 2020 09:38:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 7 May 2021 10:42:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-10"}

Prolonged periods of the gamma-ray emission\nhave prompted the suggestion that the source of the energetic protons is\nacceleration at a coronal mass ejection (CME)-driven shock, followed by\nparticle back-precipitation onto the solar atmosphere over extended times. We\nstudy the latter hypothesis using test particle simulations, which allow us to\ninvestigate whether scattering associated with turbulence aids particles in\novercoming the effect of magnetic mirroring, which impedes back-precipitation\nby reflecting particles as they travel sunwards. The instantaneous\nprecipitation fraction, $P$, the proportion of protons that successfully\nprecipitate for injection at a fixed height, $r_i$, is studied as a function of\nscattering mean free path, $\\lambda$ and $r_i$. Upper limits to the total\nprecipitation fraction, $\\overline{P}$, were calculated for eight LDGRF events\nfor moderate scattering conditions ($\\lambda$=0.1 au). We find that the\npresence of scattering helps back-precipitation compared to the scatter-free\ncase, although at very low $\\lambda$ values outward convection with the solar\nwind ultimately dominates. For eight LDGRF events, due to strong mirroring,\n$\\overline{P}$ is very small, between 0.56 and 0.93% even in the presence of\nscattering. Time-extended acceleration and large total precipitation fractions,\nas seen in the observations, cannot be reconciled for a moving shock source\naccording to our simulations. Therefore, it is not possible to obtain both long\nduration $\\gamma$ ray emission and efficient precipitation within this\nscenario. These results challenge the CME shock source scenario as the main\nmechanism for $\\gamma$ ray production in LDGRFs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2020 16:32:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Aug 2021 11:43:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 8 Nov 2021 18:04:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-02"}

One group of approaches\nis the raster methods, which rely on approximating the objects with pixelated\nrepresentations. Although they are versatile in treating irregular geometries,\nthe raster methods received limited attention in solving problems involving\nrotatable objects, where available studies generally analyze only right-angled\nrotations. In addition, raster approximation allows the use of unique\nperformance metrics and indirect consideration of constraints, which have not\nbeen exploited in the literature. This study presents the new Concurrent or\nOrdered Matrix-based Packing Arrangement Computation Technique (COMPACT). The\nmethod relies on raster representations of the objects that can be rotated by\narbitrary angles, unlike the right-angled rotation restrictions imposed in many\nexisting packing optimization studies based on raster methods. The raster\napproximations are obtained through loop-free operations that improve\nefficiency. Besides, a novel performance metric is introduced, which favors\nefficient filling of the available space by maximizing the internal contact\nbetween the objects as well as the contact between the objects and domain\nboundaries. Moreover, the objective functions are exploited to discard overlap\nand overflow constraints and enable the use of unconstrained optimization\nmethods. Several test problems involving concurrent and ordered packing of\nmultiple rectangular and circular objects into square bins are investigated.\nThe results show that the proposed technique performs effectively in\ndetermining the packing arrangements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2020 16:37:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-10"}

The\nframework is based on the nonaffine extension of lattice dynamics to amorphous\nsystems, or nonaffine response theory. The size effects due to the confinement\nare taken into account via the nonaffine part of the shear storage modulus\n$G'$. The nonaffine contribution is written as a sum over modes in $k$-space.\nWith a rigorous argument based on the analysis of the $k$-space integral over\nmodes, it is shown that the confinement size $L$ in one spatial dimension, e.g.\nthe $z$ axis, leads to a infrared cut-off for the modes contributing to the\nnonaffine (softening) correction to the modulus that scales as $L^{-3}$.\nCorrections for finite sample size $D$ in the two perpendicular dimensions\nscale as $\\sim (L/D)^4$, and are negligible for $L \\ll D$. For liquids it is\npredicted that $G'\\sim L^{-3}$ in agreement with a previous more approximate\nanalysis, whereas for amorphous materials $G' \\sim G'_{bulk} + \\beta L^{-3}$.\nFor the case of liquids, four different experimental systems are shown to be\nvery well described by the $L^{-3}$ law.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2020 16:37:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Feb 2021 16:24:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-10"}

Importantly, the\nbinding problem is not only relevant for vision but also for general\nintelligence, sensorimotor integration, event processing, and language. Various\nartificial neural network models have tackled this problem with dynamic neural\nfields and related approaches. Here we focus on a generative encoder-decoder\narchitecture that adapts its perspective and binds features by means of\nretrospective inference. We first train a model to learn sufficiently accurate\ngenerative models of dynamic biological motion or other harmonic motion\npatterns, such as a pendulum. We then scramble the input to a certain extent,\npossibly vary the perspective onto it, and propagate the prediction error back\nonto a binding matrix, that is, hidden neural states that determine feature\nbinding. Moreover, we propagate the error further back onto perspective taking\nneurons, which rotate and translate the input features onto a known frame of\nreference. Evaluations show that the resulting gradient-based inference process\nsolves the perspective taking and binding problem for known biological motion\npatterns, essentially yielding a Gestalt perception mechanism. In addition,\nredundant feature properties and population encodings are shown to be highly\nuseful. While we evaluate the algorithm on biological motion patterns, the\nprincipled approach should be applicable to binding and Gestalt perception\nproblems in other domains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2020 16:43:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-19"}

Two tasks -- text-based visual question\nanswering and text-based image captioning, with a text extension from existing\nvision-language applications, are catching on rapidly. To address these\nproblems, many sophisticated multi-modality encoding frameworks (such as\nheterogeneous graph structure) are being used. In this paper, we argue that a\nsimple attention mechanism can do the same or even better job without any bells\nand whistles. Under this mechanism, we simply split OCR token features into\nseparate visual- and linguistic-attention branches, and send them to a popular\nTransformer decoder to generate answers or captions.

Transferring it to text-based image captioning, we also surpass the\nTextCaps Challenge 2020 winner.

Motivated by functional magnetic resonance imaging\n(fMRI) studies, we propose a novel method for constructing brain connectivity\nnetworks with correlated replicates and latent effects. In a typical fMRI\nstudy, each participant is scanned and fMRI measurements are collected across a\nperiod of time. In many cases, subjects may have different states of mind that\ncannot be measured during the brain scan: for instance, some subjects may be\nawake during the first half of the brain scan, and may fall asleep during the\nsecond half of the brain scan. To model the correlation among replicates and\nlatent effects induced by the different states of mind, we assume that the\ncorrelated replicates within each independent subject follow a one-lag vector\nautoregressive model, and that the latent effects induced by the unmeasured\nconfounders are piecewise constant. The proposed method results in a convex\noptimization problem which we solve using a block coordinate descent algorithm.\nTheoretical guarantees are established for parameter estimation.

In\nautomatic song writing, lyric-to-melody generation and melody-to-lyric\ngeneration are two important tasks, both of which usually suffer from the\nfollowing challenges: 1) the paired lyric and melody data are limited, which\naffects the generation quality of the two tasks, considering a lot of paired\ntraining data are needed due to the weak correlation between lyric and melody;\n2) Strict alignments are required between lyric and melody, which relies on\nspecific alignment modeling. In this paper, we propose SongMASS to address the\nabove challenges, which leverages masked sequence to sequence (MASS)\npre-training and attention based alignment modeling for lyric-to-melody and\nmelody-to-lyric generation. Specifically, 1) we extend the original\nsentence-level MASS pre-training to song level to better capture long\ncontextual information in music, and use a separate encoder and decoder for\neach modality (lyric or melody); 2) we leverage sentence-level attention mask\nand token-level attention constraint during training to enhance the alignment\nbetween lyric and melody. During inference, we use a dynamic programming\nstrategy to obtain the alignment between each word/syllable in lyric and note\nin melody. We pre-train SongMASS on unpaired lyric and melody datasets, and\nboth objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that SongMASS generates\nlyric and melody with significantly better quality than the baseline method\nwithout pre-training or alignment constraint.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2020 16:56:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-10"}

Blazars are the most numerous class of High Energy (HE; E about 50\nMeV - few 100 GeV) and Very High Energy (VHE; E about 100 GeV - 10 TeV)\ngamma-ray emitters. As of today, a measured spectroscopic redshift is available\nfor only about 50% of gamma-ray BL Lacs, mainly due to the difficulty of\nmeasuring reliable redshifts from their nearly featureless, continuum-dominated\noptical spectra. The knowledge of the redshift is fundamental for understanding\nthe emission from blazars, for population studies and also for indirect studies\nof the extragalactic background light and searches for Lorentz invariance\nviolation and axion-like particles using blazars.

This paper is the first\nof a series of papers which aim to measure the redshift of a sample of blazars\nlikely to be detected with the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA), a\nground based gamma-ray observatory. Methods. Monte Carlo simulations were\nperformed to select those hard spectrum gamma-ray blazars detected with the\nFermi-LAT telescope still lacking redshift measurements but likely to be\ndetected by CTA in 30 hours of observing time or less. Optical observing\ncampaigns involving deep imaging and spectroscopic observations were organised\nto efficiently constrain their redshifts.

Designing a generic face anti-spoofing model to\nestimate those spoof traces can improve not only the generalization of the\nspoof detection, but also the interpretability of the model's decision. Yet,\nthis is a challenging task due to the diversity of spoof types and the lack of\nground truth in spoof traces. In this work, we design a novel adversarial\nlearning framework to disentangle spoof faces into the spoof traces and the\nlive counterparts. Guided by physical properties, the spoof generation is\nrepresented as a combination of additive process and inpainting process.\nAdditive process describes spoofing as spoof material introducing extra\npatterns (e.g., moire pattern), where the live counterpart can be recovered by\nremoving those patterns. Inpainting process describes spoofing as spoof\nmaterial fully covering certain regions, where the live counterpart of those\nregions has to be \"guessed\". We use 3 additive components and 1 inpainting\ncomponent to represent traces at different frequency bands. The disentangled\nspoof traces can be utilized to synthesize realistic new spoof faces after\nproper geometric correction, and the synthesized spoof can be used for training\nand improve the generalization of spoof detection. Our approach demonstrates\nsuperior spoof detection performance on 3 testing scenarios: known attacks,\nunknown attacks, and open-set attacks. Meanwhile, it provides a\nvisually-convincing estimation of the spoof traces. Source code and pre-trained\nmodels will be publicly available upon publication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2020 17:22:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-10"}

A combination of explicit computations,\nformal asymptotics, and numerical simulations has led to conjectures on the\nbifurcation behavior, certain aspects of which are proven rigorously in this\nwork. In particular, the stability of the zero state, where the model has a\nsmoothness deficit is analyzed by a combination of regularizing transformations\nand blow-up techniques.

To do\nso, we simulate the contact shapes that a dense set of object poses would\nproduce on the sensor. Then, given a new contact shape obtained from the sensor\noutput, we match it against the pre-computed set using the object-specific\nembedding learned purely in simulation using contrastive learning.\n  This results in a perception model that can localize objects from a single\ntactile observation. It also allows reasoning over pose distributions and\nincluding additional pose constraints coming from other perception systems or\nmultiple contacts. We provide quantitative results for four objects.

The view\nthat the axiomatization of the subject is primarily a mathematical problem has\nbeen prevalent. This view, however, implicitly asserts that said axiomatization\ncan be achieved without readdressing the basic concepts of quantum theory -- an\nassertion that becomes more implausible the longer the debate on the conceptual\nfoundations of quantum mechanics itself continues.\n  In this work we suggest a new approach to the above problem, which views the\nnon-relativistic theory from a purely statistical perspective: to generalize\nthe quantum-mechanical Born rule for particle position probability to the\ngeneral-relativistic setting. The advantages of this approach are that one\nobtains a statistical theory from the onset and that it is independent of any\nparticular dynamical models and the symmetries of Minkowski spacetime.\n  Here we develop the smooth $1$-body generalization, based on prior\ncontributions mainly due to C. Eckart and J. Ehlers.

The\npublication of 1.47 billion stellar parallaxes from Gaia is a major\ncontribution to this. Yet despite Gaia's precision, the majority of these stars\nare so distant or faint that their fractional parallax uncertainties are large,\nthereby precluding a simple inversion of parallax to provide a distance. Here\nwe take a probabilistic approach to estimating stellar distances that uses a\nprior constructed from a three-dimensional model of our Galaxy. This model\nincludes interstellar extinction and Gaia's variable magnitude limit. We infer\ntwo types of distance. The first, geometric, uses the parallax together with a\ndirection-dependent prior on distance. The second, photogeometric, additionally\nuses the colour and apparent magnitude of a star, by exploiting the fact that\nstars of a given colour have a restricted range of probable absolute magnitudes\n(plus extinction). Tests on simulated data and external validations show that\nthe photogeometric estimates generally have higher accuracy and precision for\nstars with poor parallaxes. We provide a catalogue of 1.47 billion geometric\nand 1.35 billion photogeometric distances together with asymmetric uncertainty\nmeasures.

We give a strong negative answer by showing that the\nlog n overhead is still necessary for some transitive functions even when we\nallow the quantum communication protocol an error probability that can be\narbitrarily close to 1/2.\n  - We also give, among other things, a general recipe to construct functions\nfor which the log n overhead is required in the BCW simulation in the\nbounded-error communication model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2020 18:58:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Apr 2023 18:10:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-27"}

As a result, we obtain\nring-like images and triple-forked images around the black hole for face-on and\nedge-on cases, respectively.

We find that the initial GRF spectral\nindex $\\alpha$ has a dramatic impact on the pure hydrodynamic development of\nthermal instability, influencing the size, number and motions of clouds. Cloud\nfragmentation happens due to two mechanisms: tearing and contraction rebound.\nIn the runs with isotropic conduction and viscosity, the structures and\ndynamics of the clouds are dominated by evaporation and condensation flows in\nthe non-linear regime, and the flow speed is regulated by viscosity. Cloud\ndisruptions happen as a result of the Darrieus--Landau instability (DLI).\nAlthough at very late times, all individual clouds merge into one cold\nstructure in all hydrodynamic runs. In the MHD case, the cloud structure is\ndetermined by both the initial perturbations and the initial magnetic field\nstrength. In high $\\beta$ runs, anisotropic conduction causes dense filaments\nto align with the local magnetic fields and the field direction can become\nreoriented. Strong magnetic fields suppress cross-field contraction and cold\nfilaments can form along or perpendicular to the initial fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2020 19:00:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 21 Aug 2021 19:41:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-24"}

When element-based amplitude calibration is\nnot needed, as is typical in optical interferometry, the 3-element interference\nimage formed from phase-uncalibrated correlations is a true and uncorrupted\nrepresentation of the source object's morphology, except for a possible shift.\nBased on this SOS conservation principle, we present two geometric methods to\nmeasure the closure phase directly from a 3-element interference image (without\nrequiring an aperture-plane view): (i) the closure phase is directly measurable\nfrom any one of the triangle's heights, and (ii) the squared closure phase is\nproportional to the product of the areas enclosed by the triad of array\nelements and the principal triangle in the aperture and image planes,\nrespectively.

The utility of random quantum circuits in these settings stems\nfrom their ability to rapidly generate quantum pseudo-randomness. In a seminal\npaper by Brand\\~ao, Harrow, and Horodecki, it was proven that the $t$-th moment\noperator of local random quantum circuits on $n$ qudits with local dimension\n$q$ has a spectral gap of at least $\\Omega(n^{-1}t^{-5-3.1/\\log(q)})$, which\nimplies that they are efficient constructions of approximate unitary designs.\nAs a first result, we use Knabe bounds for the spectral gaps of\nfrustration-free Hamiltonians to show that $1D$ random quantum circuits have a\nspectral gap scaling as $\\Omega(n^{-1})$, provided that $t$ is small compared\nto the local dimension: $t^2\\leq O(q)$.

Especially in small central convective regions the value is\nhighly uncertain due to its tight connection to the pressure scale height.\nLong-term multi-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations can be used to study the\nsize of the overshooting region and the involved mixing processes. Here we show\nhow one can calibrate an overshooting parameter by performing 2D Maestro\nsimulations of Zero-Age-Main-Sequence stars ranging from $1.3$ to $3.5\nM_\\odot$. The simulations cover the convective cores of the stars and a large\nfraction of the surrounding radiative envelope. We follow the convective flow\nfor at least 20 convective turnover times, while the longest simulation covers\n430 turnover time scales. This allows us to study how the mixing as well as the\nconvective boundary evolve with time, and how the resulting entrainment can be\ninterpreted in terms of overshooting parameters. We find that increasing the\novershooting parameter $f_{ov}$ beyond a certain value in the initial model of\nour simulations, changes the mixing behaviour completely. This result can be\nused to put limits on the overshooting parameter. We find $0.010 < f_{ov} <\n0.017$ to be in good agreement with our simulations of a $3.5 M_\\odot$ mass\nstar. We also identify a diffusive mixing component due to internal gravity\nwaves (IGW) that is active throughout the convectively stable layer, but likely\noverestimated in our simulations. Furthermore, applying our calibration method\nto simulations of less massive stars suggests a need for a mass-dependent\novershooting description where the mixing in terms of the pressure scale height\nis reduced for small convective cores.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2020 19:03:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-08"}

To that end, prior research has investigated a wide range of\nmethods that guide the geographic placement of WQ sensors. These methods assign\na metric for fixed sensor placement (SP) followed by\n\\textit{metric-optimization} to obtain optimal SP. These metrics include\nminimizing intrusion detection time, minimizing the expected population and\namount of contaminated water affected by an intrusion event. In contrast to the\nliterature, the objective of this paper is to provide a computational method\nthat considers the overlooked metric of state estimation and network-wide\nobservability of the WQ dynamics. This metric finds the optimal WQ sensor\nplacement that minimizes the state estimation error via the Kalman filter for\nnoisy WQ dynamics -- a metric that quantifies WDN observability. To that end,\nthe state-space dynamics of WQ states for an entire WDN are given and the\nobservability-driven sensor placement algorithm is presented. The algorithm\ntakes into account the time-varying nature of WQ dynamics due to changes in the\nhydraulic profile -- a collection of hydraulic states including heads\n(pressures) at nodes and flow rates in links which are caused by a demand\nprofile over a certain period of time. Thorough case studies are given,\nhighlighting key findings, observations, and recommendations for WDN operators.\nGithub codes are included for reproducibility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2020 19:12:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-11"}

Bayesian networks (BNs) are often used in these\ndomains because of their graphical and causal interpretations. BN parameter\nlearning from incomplete data is usually implemented with the\nExpectation-Maximisation algorithm (EM), which computes the relevant sufficient\nstatistics (\"soft EM\") using belief propagation. Similarly, the Structural\nExpectation-Maximisation algorithm (Structural EM) learns the network structure\nof the BN from those sufficient statistics using algorithms designed for\ncomplete data. However, practical implementations of parameter and structure\nlearning often impute missing data (\"hard EM\") to compute sufficient statistics\ninstead of using belief propagation, for both ease of implementation and\ncomputational speed. In this paper, we investigate the question: what is the\nimpact of using imputation instead of belief propagation on the quality of the\nresulting BNs? From a simulation study using synthetic data and reference BNs,\nwe find that it is possible to recommend one approach over the other in several\nscenarios based on the characteristics of the data.

Second, neutrino mass is usually held fixed in the analyses which\ncould obscure its relation to MG parameters.

The spectral statistics are characterized by the traces\nof powers $t$ of the Floquet operator, and our approach hinges on the fact\nthat, for integer $t$ in systems with local interactions, these traces can be\nre-expressed in terms of products of dual transfer matrices, each representing\na spatial slice of the system. We focus on properties of the dual transfer\nmatrix products as represented by a spectrum of Lyapunov exponents, which we\ncall \\textit{spectral Lyapunov exponents}. In particular, we examine the\nfeatures of this spectrum that distinguish chaotic and MBL phases. The transfer\nmatrices can be block-diagonalized using time-translation symmetry, and so the\nspectral Lyapunov exponents are classified according to a momentum in the time\ndirection. For large $t$ we argue that the leading Lyapunov exponents in each\nmomentum sector tend to zero in the chaotic phase, while they remain finite in\nthe MBL phase. These conclusions are based on results from three complementary\ntypes of calculation. We find exact results for the chaotic phase by\nconsidering a Floquet random quantum circuit with on-site Hilbert space\ndimension $q$ in the large-$q$ limit.

A wide range of approaches\nhave been proposed, which can be applied in k-space and/or image-space.\nPromising results have been demonstrated from a range of methods, enabling\nnatural looking images and rapid computation. In this review article we\nsummarize the current machine learning approaches used in MRI reconstruction,\ndiscuss their drawbacks, clinical applications, and current trends.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2020 20:38:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-11"}

However, because most contemporary scene understanding\napproaches are applied under ideal-weather conditions, such approaches may not\nprovide genuinely optimal performance when compared to established a priori\ninsights on extreme-weather understanding. In this paper, we propose a complex\nbut competitive multi-task learning approach capable of performing in real-time\nsemantic scene understanding and monocular depth estimation under foggy weather\nconditions by leveraging both recent advances in adversarial training and\ndomain adaptation. As an end-to-end pipeline, our model provides a novel\nsolution to surpass degraded visibility in foggy weather conditions by\ntransferring scenes from foggy to normal using a GAN-based model. For optimal\nperformance in semantic segmentation, our model generates depth to be used as\ncomplementary source information with RGB in the segmentation network. We\nprovide a robust method for foggy scene understanding by training two models\n(normal and foggy) simultaneously with shared weights (each model is trained on\neach weather condition independently). Our model incorporates RGB colour,\ndepth, and luminance images via distinct encoders with dense connectivity and\nfeatures fusing, and leverages skip connections to produce consistent depth and\nsegmentation predictions. Using this architectural formulation with light\ncomputational complexity at inference time, we are able to achieve comparable\nperformance to contemporary approaches at a fraction of the overall model\ncomplexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2020 20:38:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-11"}

Using numerical simulations, alterations to the unsteady wake\ndynamics imposed by abrupt changes in the phase angle between two pitching\nside-by-side foils were examined at Reynolds number of 4;000 and Strouhal\nnumber of 0:50. Four hybrid modes were considered in thisstudy with two modes\nrepresenting an abrupt phase change by pi during the 20th cycle. The other two\nmodes represented a simplified case of burst-and-coast swimming, in which there\nwas a brief (2 oscillation periods) suspension of oscillations before imposing\na change in phase angle. In all cases, the foils initially performed\nout-of-phase pitching, and then they started their in-phase motion by either\nperforming the upstroke or down-stroke first. This kinematic change resulted in\nthe formation and growth of a secondary vortex street in between two primary\nstreets, which enabled and maintained a split wake configuration. Furthermore,\nthe phase switching altered the pressure levels on the top and bottom surfaces\nof both foils to almost similar levels, which attributed to a reduction in the\nside-force.

To overcome this difficulty, in practice, the\nfunctional data that belong to the infinite-dimensional space are generally\nprojected into a finite-dimensional space of basis functions. The\nfunction-on-function regression model is converted to a multivariate regression\nmodel of the basis expansion coefficients.

Our approach incorporates RGB colour, depth and\nluminance images via distinct encoders with dense connectivity and features\nfusion to effectively exploit information from different inputs, which\ncontributes to an optimal feature representation within the overall model.\nUsing this architectural formulation with dense skip connections, our model\nachieves comparable performance to contemporary approaches at a fraction of the\noverall model complexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2020 21:04:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-11"}

In the quest for DL\ntrustworthiness, recent works claimed the inherent robustness of Spiking Neural\nNetworks (SNNs) to these attacks, without considering the variability in their\nstructural spiking parameters. This paper explores the security enhancement of\nSNNs through internal structural parameters.

It is therefore\ndifficult to develop fully-automated analysis routines for phase contrast TEM\nstudies using conventional image processing tools. For automated analysis of\nlarge sample regions of graphene, one of the key problems is segmentation\nbetween the structure of interest and unwanted structures such as surface\ncontaminant layers.

The key idea is to couple SPHinXsys, an open-source\nmulti-physics library in unified smoothed particle hydrodynamic (SPH)\nframework, with Simbody which presents an object-oriented Application\nProgramming Interface (API) for multi-body dynamics. More precisely, the wave\ndynamics and its interaction with OWSC is resolved by Riemann-based\nweakly-compressible SPH method using SPHinXsys, and the solid-body kinematics\nis computed by Simbody library. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the\nproposed solver can accurately predict the wave elevations, flap rotation and\nwave loading on the flap in comparison with laboratory experiment. In\nparticularly, the new solver shows optimized computational performance through\nCPU cost analysis and comparison with commercial software package ANSYS FLUENT\nand other SPH-based solvers in literature. Furthermore, a linear damper is\napplied for imitating the power take-off (PTO) system to study its effects on\nthe hydrodynamics properties of OWSC and efficiency of energy harvesting. In\naddition, the present solver is used to model extreme wave condition using the\nfocused wave approach to investigate the extreme loads and motions of OWSC\nunder such extreme wave conditions. It worth noting that though the model\nvalidation used herein is a bottom hinged oscillating Wave Energy Converter\n(WEC), the obtained numerical results show promising potential of the proposed\nsolver to future applications in the design of high-performance WECs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2020 21:23:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-11"}

In this work, we introduce a novel relaxation of local differential\nprivacy (LDP) that naturally arises in fully decentralized algorithms, i.e.,\nwhen participants exchange information by communicating along the edges of a\nnetwork graph without central coordinator. This relaxation, that we call\nnetwork DP, captures the fact that users have only a local view of the system.\nTo show the relevance of network DP, we study a decentralized model of\ncomputation where a token performs a walk on the network graph and is updated\nsequentially by the party who receives it. For tasks such as real summation,\nhistogram computation and optimization with gradient descent, we propose simple\nalgorithms on ring and complete topologies. We prove that the privacy-utility\ntrade-offs of our algorithms under network DP significantly improve upon what\nis achievable under LDP, and often match the utility of the trusted curator\nmodel. Our results show for the first time that formal privacy gains can be\nobtained from full decentralization.

It is therefore\nnecessary to have a principled way to combine and reconcile these estimates. To\nthis end, we present a Bayesian hierarchical model for estimating the size of\nkey populations that combines multiple estimates from different sources of\ninformation. The proposed model makes use of multiple years of data and\nexplicitly models the systematic error in the data sources used. We use the\nmodel to estimate the size of people who inject drugs in Ukraine. We evaluate\nthe appropriateness of the model and compare the contribution of each data\nsource to the final estimates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2020 22:15:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Jul 2021 01:44:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-14"}

It is an important aspect of user\nexperience to know the Remaining Charging Time (RCT) of an EV with confidence.\nHowever, it is difficult to find an algorithm that accurately estimates the RCT\nfor vehicles in the current EV market. The maximum RCT estimation error of the\nTesla Model X can be as high as 60 minutes from a 10 % to 99 % state-of-charge\n(SOC) while charging at direct current (DC). A highly accurate RCT estimation\nalgorithm for electric vehicles is in high demand and will continue to be as\nEVs become more popular. There are currently two challenges to arriving at an\naccurate RCT estimate. First, most commercial chargers cannot provide requested\ncharging currents during a constant current (CC) stage. Second, it is hard to\npredict the charging current profile in a constant voltage (CV) stage. To\naddress the first issue, this study proposes an RCT algorithm that updates the\ncharging accuracy online in the CC stage by considering the confidence interval\nbetween the historical charging accuracy and real-time charging accuracy data.\nTo solve the second issue, this study proposes a battery resistance prediction\nmodel to predict charging current profiles in the CV stage, using a Radial\nBasis Function (RBF) neural network (NN). The test results demonstrate that the\nRCT algorithm proposed in this study achieves an error rate improvement of 73.6\n% and 84.4 % over the traditional method in the CC and CV stages, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2020 22:48:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-11"}

A lot of problems in applications\nare defined on bounded intervals or domains. Therefore, it is important in both\ntheory and application to construct all possible wavelets on intervals with\nsome desired properties from (bi)orthogonal (multi)wavelets on the real line.\nVanishing moments of compactly supported wavelets are the key property for\nsparse wavelet representations and are closely linked to polynomial\nreproduction of their underlying refinable (vector) functions. Boundary\nwavelets with low order vanishing moments often lead to undesired boundary\nartifacts as well as reduced sparsity and approximation orders near boundaries\nin applications.

We demonstrate this\ntoolkit by using it to establish the intractability of a number of MOT problems\nstudied in the literature that have resisted previous algorithmic efforts. For\ninstance, we provide evidence that repulsive costs make MOT intractable by\nshowing that several such problems of interest are NP-hard to solve--even\napproximately.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Dec 2020 01:36:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-16"}

However, considering the data privacy and the inefficiency of data\ntransmission, it is impractical in real scenarios. Hence, it draws our eyes to\noptimize the network in the target domain without accessing labeled source\ndata. To explore this direction in object detection, for the first time, we\npropose a source data-free domain adaptive object detection (SFOD) framework\nvia modeling it into a problem of learning with noisy labels. Generally, a\nstraightforward method is to leverage the pre-trained network from the source\ndomain to generate the pseudo labels for target domain optimization. However,\nit is difficult to evaluate the quality of pseudo labels since no labels are\navailable in target domain. In this paper, self-entropy descent (SED) is a\nmetric proposed to search an appropriate confidence threshold for reliable\npseudo label generation without using any handcrafted labels. Nonetheless,\ncompletely clean labels are still unattainable. After a thorough experimental\nanalysis, false negatives are found to dominate in the generated noisy labels.\nUndoubtedly, false negatives mining is helpful for performance improvement, and\nwe ease it to false negatives simulation through data augmentation like Mosaic.\nExtensive experiments conducted in four representative adaptation tasks have\ndemonstrated that the proposed framework can easily achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance. From another view, it also reminds the UDA community that the\nlabeled source data are not fully exploited in the existing methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Dec 2020 01:42:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-11"}

In the case of thermal DM of a mass between a few MeV and a\nfew GeV, a compelling and much-explored framework is that of a dark\nphoton/vector portal, which posits a new $U(1)$ \"dark photon\" which only\ncouples to the SM via small kinetic mixing (KM) with the SM hypercharge. This\nmixing can be mediated at the one-loop level by portal matter (PM) fields which\nare charged under both the dark $U(1)$ and the SM gauge group. In earlier work,\none of the authors has noted that models with appropriate portal matter content\nto produce finite and calculable kinetic mixing can arise from non-minimal dark\nsectors, in which the dark $U(1)$ is a subgroup of a larger gauge symmetry\nunder which SM particles might have non-trivial representations.

We also demonstrate the underlying kinetics of the\nphase transition by studying the time evolution of the probability distribution\nof the state in the ensemble as well as the MFPT and the kinetic fluctuation of\nthe state switching process caused by the thermal fluctuations. The final\ndistribution is determined by the Boltzmann law and the MFPT and its\nfluctuation are closely related to the free energy landscape topography through\nbarrier heights and ensemble temperature.

Additionally, most lung nodules visible on chest X-ray are benign;\ntherefore, the narrow task of computer vision-based lung nodule detection\ncannot be equated to automated lung cancer detection. Addressing both concerns,\nthis study introduces a novel hybrid deep learning and decision tree-based\ncomputer vision model which presents lung cancer malignancy predictions as\ninterpretable decision trees. The deep learning component of this process is\ntrained using a large publicly available dataset on pathological biomarkers\nassociated with lung cancer. These models are then used to inference biomarker\nscores for chest X-ray images from two, independent data sets for which\nmalignancy metadata is available. We mine multi-variate predictive models by\nfitting shallow decision trees to the malignancy stratified datasets and\ninterrogate a range of metrics to determine the best model. Our best decision\ntree model achieves sensitivity and specificity of 86.7% and 80.0% respectively\nwith a positive predictive value of 92.9%. Decision trees mined using this\nmethod may be considered as a starting point for refinement into clinically\nuseful multi-variate lung cancer malignancy models for implementation as a\nworkflow augmentation tool to improve the efficiency of human radiologists.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Dec 2020 04:11:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2020 08:57:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 29 Aug 2021 10:20:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-31"}

Moreover and unlike most of the existing nonparametric\nregression estimators, no extra regularization step is required by our proposed\nestimator. Although, this estimator is initially designed to work with random\nsampling set of uni-variate i.i.d. random variables following a Beta\ndistribution, we show that it is still works for a wide range of sampling\ndistribution laws.

We propose a dynamic chunk-based attention strategy\nto allow arbitrary right context length. At inference time, the CTC decoder\ngenerates n-best hypotheses in a streaming way. The inference latency could be\neasily controlled by only changing the chunk size. The CTC hypotheses are then\nrescored by the attention decoder to get the final result. This efficient\nrescoring process causes very little sentence-level latency. Our experiments on\nthe open 170-hour AISHELL-1 dataset show that, the proposed method can unify\nthe streaming and non-streaming model simply and efficiently. On the AISHELL-1\ntest set, our unified model achieves 5.60% relative character error rate (CER)\nreduction in non-streaming ASR compared to a standard non-streaming\ntransformer.

So far, much\nefforts have been made to produce 2D compound materials with large domain size,\ncontrollable number of layers, fast-growth rate, and high quality features,\netc. However, due to the complicated growth mechanism like sublimation and\ndiffusion processes of multiple precursors, maintaining the controllability,\nrepeatability, and high quality of CVD grown 2D binary and ternary materials is\nstill a big challenge, which prevents their widespread use. Here, taking 2D\ntransition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) as examples, we review current\nprogress and highlight some promising growth strategies for the growth of 2D\ncompound materials. The key technology issues which affect the CVD process,\nincluding non-metal precursor, metal precursor, substrate engineering,\ntemperature, and gas flow, are discussed. Also, methods in improving the\nquality of CVD-grown 2D materials and current understanding on their growth\nmechanism are highlighted.

Existing deep learning models have achieved great\nprogress to tackle the problem of fake news detection.

To improve the detection performance of fake news, we take\nadvantage of the event correlations of news and propose an event correlation\nfiltering method (ECFM) for fake news detection, mainly consisting of the news\ncharacterizer, the pseudo label annotator, the event credibility updater, and\nthe news entropy selector. The news characterizer is responsible for extracting\ntextual features from news, which cooperates with the pseudo label annotator to\nassign pseudo labels for unlabeled news by fully exploiting the event\ncorrelations of news. In addition, the event credibility updater employs\nadaptive Kalman filter to weaken the credibility fluctuations of events. To\nfurther improve the detection performance, the news entropy selector\nautomatically discovers high-quality samples from pseudo labeled news by\nquantifying their news entropy.

The model can be used for a wide range of flows: from the pure\ncapillary flow regime, where the capillary forces are the main driver of the\nliquid in the channel, to the external pressure flow regime where the external\npressure applied to the liquid at the entrance to the channel is much larger\nthan the capillary pressure in the channel, so that the capillary force can be\nignored. We apply the model to rectangular Y-shape junctions, where the base\nchannel is connected to a reservoir and the end channels are exposed to\natmospheric air. We show that, in asymmetric Y-shape junctions, there can be a\ntime of meniscus arrest, where only one of the two channels with a smaller\nradius fills, and, the other one, with a larger radius, is arrested. The time\nof meniscus arrest decreases with an increase in the applied external pressure;\nwhen this pressure becomes large enough, the meniscus arrest disappears.\nHowever, if the ratio of the radii of the end channels is large, the meniscus\narrest does not appear because the flow resistance in the channel with the\nsmaller radius is much large than in the channel with the larger radius so that\nthe initial flow in the wider channel cannot be stopped by the differences in\nthe surface tension pressures in these channels. In this article, we also\ninvestigate the applicability of the fully developed flow approximation assumed\nin the model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Dec 2020 07:52:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-14"}

During ECAAF, the interactions of communication\ncapacity, video offloading, 3D map quality, and channel state of the trajectory\nform a positive feedback loop.

In addition, X-ray\nand CT imaging methods are also used to support this method. Since it is known\nthat the accuracy sensitivity in rRT-PCR test is low, auxiliary diagnostic\nmethods have a very important place. Computer-aided diagnosis and detection\nsystems are developed especially with the help of X-ray and CT images. Studies\non the detection of COVID19 in the literature are increasing day by day. In\nthis study, the effect of different batch size (BH=3, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50)\nparameter values on their performance in detecting COVID19 and other classes\nwas investigated using data belonging to 4 different (Viral Pneumonia, COVID19,\nNormal, Bacterial Pneumonia) classes. The study was carried out using a\npre-trained ResNet50 convolutional neural network. According to the obtained\nresults, they performed closely on the training and test data. However, it was\nobserved that the steady state in the test data was delayed as the batch size\nvalue increased. The highest COVID19 detection was 95.17% for BH = 3, while the\noverall accuracy value was 97.97% with BH = 20. According to the findings, it\ncan be said that the batch size value does not affect the overall performance\nsignificantly, but the increase in the batch size value delays obtaining stable\nresults.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Dec 2020 09:25:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-11"}

Numerous\nshape modelling applications use surface evolution in order to improve shape\nproperties, such as appearance or accuracy.

However, explicit mesh\nrepresentations, while allowing for accurate surface modelling, suffer from the\ninherent difficulty of reliably dealing with self-intersections and topological\nchanges such as merges and splits. As a consequence, a majority of methods rely\non implicit representations of surfaces, e.g. level-sets, that naturally\novercome these issues. Nevertheless, these methods are based on volumetric\ndiscretizations, which introduce an unwanted precision-complexity trade-off.\nThe method that we propose handles topological changes in a robust manner and\nremoves self intersections, thus overcoming the traditional limitations of\nmesh-based approaches.

Depending\non particle size and dispersity, either an amorphous arrangement, a crystalline\narrangement, or a rate-dependent amorphous-to-crystalline transition occurs at\nthe drying surface. Amorphous arrangements are observed in the two most\npolydisperse suspensions while crystallinity occurs when dispersity is lower.\nCounter-intuitively in the latter case, a higher drying rate favors ordering of\nthe particles. To complement these measurements and to take stock of the bulk\nproperties of the layer, tests on the layer porosity were undertaken.

Our results show that the elliptical\naccretion disks have distinctive hydrodynamic structures and spectral energy\ndistributions, associated with TDEs. The soft X-ray photons generated at\npericenter and nearby are trapped in the disk and advected around the ellipse\nbecause of large electron scattering opacity. They are absorbed and reprocessed\ninto emission lines and low-frequency continuum via recombination and\nbremsstrahlung emission. Because of the rapid increase of bound-free and\nfree-free opacities with radius, the low-frequency continuum photons become\ntrapped in the disk at large radius and are advected through apocenter and back\nto the photon-trapping radius. Elliptical accretion disks predict sub-Eddington\nluminosities and emit mainly at the photon-trapping radius of thousands of\nSchwarzschild radii with a blackbody spectrum of nearly single temperature of\ntypically about 3X10^4 K. Because of the self-regulation, the photon-trapping\nradius expands and contracts following the rise and fall of accretion rate.

Existing stereo matching methods estimate disparity\ninstead of depth. They treat the disparity errors as the evaluation metric of\nthe depth estimation errors, since the depth can be calculated from the\ndisparity according to the triangulation principle. However, we find that the\nerror of the depth depends not only on the error of the disparity but also on\nthe depth range of the points. Therefore, even if the disparity error is low,\nthe depth error is still large, especially for the distant points. In this\npaper, a novel Direct Depth Learning Network (DDL-Net) is designed for stereo\nmatching. DDL-Net consists of two stages: the Coarse Depth Estimation stage and\nthe Adaptive-Grained Depth Refinement stage, which are all supervised by depth\ninstead of disparity. Specifically, Coarse Depth Estimation stage uniformly\nsamples the matching candidates according to depth range to construct cost\nvolume and output coarse depth. Adaptive-Grained Depth Refinement stage\nperforms further matching near the coarse depth to correct the imprecise\nmatching and wrong matching. To make the Adaptive-Grained Depth Refinement\nstage robust to the coarse depth and adaptive to the depth range of the points,\nthe Granularity Uncertainty is introduced to Adaptive-Grained Depth Refinement\nstage. Granularity Uncertainty adjusts the matching range and selects the\ncandidates' features according to coarse prediction confidence and depth range.\nWe verify the performance of DDL-Net on SceneFlow dataset and DrivingStereo\ndataset by different depth metrics. Results show that DDL-Net achieves an\naverage improvement of 25% on the SceneFlow dataset and $12\\%$ on the\nDrivingStereo dataset comparing the classical methods.

The WD progenitor evolves in\nisolation, but its wind during the AGB phase pollutes the companion surface and\ntransfers some angular momentum. Within SHINE survey that uses SPHERE at the\nVLT, we acquired images of HD2133, HD114174, and CD-567708 and combined this\ndata with high resolution spectra of the primaries, TESS, and literature data.\nWe performed accurate abundance analyses for the MS. We found brighter J and K\nmagnitudes for HD114174B than obtained previously and extended the photometry\ndown to 0.95 micron. Our new data indicate a higher temperature and then\nshorter cooling age (5.57+/-0.02 Gyr) and larger mass (0.75+/-0.03 Mo) for this\nWD than previously assumed. This solved the discrepancy previously found with\nthe age of the MS star. The two other WDs are less massive, indicating\nprogenitors of ~1.3 Mo and 1.5-1.8 Mo for HD2133B and CD-56 7708B,\nrespectively. We were able to derive constraints on the orbit for HD114174 and\nCD-56 7708. The composition of the MS stars agrees fairly well with\nexpectations from pollution by the AGB progenitors of the WDs: HD2133A has a\nsmall enrichment of n-capture elements, which is as expected for pollution by\nan AGB star with a mass <1.5 Mo; CD-56 7708A is a previously unrecognized mild\nBa-star, which is expected due to pollution by an AGB star with a mass in the\nrange of 1.5-3.0 Mo; and HD114174 has a very moderate excess of n-capture\nelements, which is in agreement with the expectation for a massive AGB star to\nhave a mass >3.0 Mo. On the other hand, none of these stars show the excesses\nof C that are expected to go along with those of n-capture elements.

To this end, we first propose to\ndecompose the full matching task into multiple stages of the cost aggregation\nmodule.

The focus of\ncaloric materials investigations has shifted recently from solid-state\nmaterials toward soft materials, such as liquid crystals and liquid crystalline\nelastomers. It has been shown recently that a large electrocaloric effect\nexceeding 7 K can be observed in smectic liquid crystals.

These\nsyntactic foams are closed cell composite foams with thin-walled microballoons\ndispersed in a matrix (resin) whose closed cell structure provides excellent\nmechanical properties, like high strength and low density. There are several\nparameters that can contribute towards their mechanical properties, including,\nmicroballoon volume fraction, microballoon wall thickness, bonding between the\nmicroballoons and the matrix, and the crushing strength of microballoons.\nConducting purely experimental testing by varying these parameters can be very\ntime sensitive and expensive.

Hence, the\ninfluence of key structural and material parameters associated with syntactic\nfoams that dictate the mechanics of densification is studied here by\nimplementing micromechanics based computational models and multiple linear\nregression analysis.

In this paper, we\ncalculate Yoshinaga's explicit formula through the decomposition of the Ehrhart\nquasi-polynomial into several quasi-polynomials and a modified shift operator,\nand obtain new formulas for the characteristic quasi-polynomial of the Linial\narrangement. In particular, when the parameter of the Linial arrangement is\nrelatively prime to the period of the Ehrhart quasi-polynomial, we prove the\nPostnikov-Stanley Linial arrangement conjecture. This generalizes some of the\nresults for the root systems of classical types that have been proved by\nPostnikov-Stanley and Athanasiadis. For other cases, we verify this conjecture\nfor exceptional root systems using a computational approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Dec 2020 12:36:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-11"}

However, most of the existing large ECG datasets are roughly\nannotated, so the classification model trained on them can only detect the\nexistence of abnormalities in a whole recording, but cannot determine their\nexact occurrence time. In addition, it may take huge time and economic cost to\nconstruct a fine-annotated ECG dataset. Therefore, this study proposes weakly\nsupervised deep learning models for detecting abnormal ECG events and their\noccurrence time. The available supervision information for the models is\nlimited to the event types in an ECG record, excluding the specific occurring\ntime of each event. By leverage of feature locality of deep convolution neural\nnetwork, the models first make predictions based on the local features, and\nthen aggregate the local predictions to infer the existence of each event\nduring the whole record. Through training, the local predictions are expected\nto reflect the specific occurring time of each event. To test their potentials,\nwe apply the models for detecting cardiac rhythmic and morphological\narrhythmias by using the AFDB and MITDB datasets, respectively. The results\nshow that the models achieve beat-level accuracies of 99.09% in detecting\natrial fibrillation, and 99.13% in detecting morphological arrhythmias, which\nare comparable to that of fully supervised learning models, demonstrating their\neffectiveness.

So far,\nchannel measurements at sea have mainly been conducted with antennas placed a\ncouple of meters above the sea surface, which is higher than the buoys\nthemselves. Therefore, we investigated the validity of the published channel\nmodels at sea by means of path loss measurements using a LoRa link with a\ntransmitter antenna height of 0.35 m and a base station antenna height of 2.65\nm and 5.2 m. Our results show that the round earth loss model is not accurate\nat these antenna heights. The ITU-R P.2001-3 model and a model by Bullington\nshow a better agreement with our measurements.

Here we study how to design\nartificial agents that can interact naturally with humans using the\nsimplification of a virtual environment. This setting nevertheless integrates a\nnumber of the central challenges of artificial intelligence (AI) research:\ncomplex visual perception and goal-directed physical control, grounded language\ncomprehension and production, and multi-agent social interaction. To build\nagents that can robustly interact with humans, we would ideally train them\nwhile they interact with humans. However, this is presently impractical.\nTherefore, we approximate the role of the human with another learned agent, and\nuse ideas from inverse reinforcement learning to reduce the disparities between\nhuman-human and agent-agent interactive behaviour. Rigorously evaluating our\nagents poses a great challenge, so we develop a variety of behavioural tests,\nincluding evaluation by humans who watch videos of agents or interact directly\nwith them. These evaluations convincingly demonstrate that interactive training\nand auxiliary losses improve agent behaviour beyond what is achieved by\nsupervised learning of actions alone. Further, we demonstrate that agent\ncapabilities generalise beyond literal experiences in the dataset. Finally, we\ntrain evaluation models whose ratings of agents agree well with human\njudgement, thus permitting the evaluation of new agent models without\nadditional effort. Taken together, our results in this virtual environment\nprovide evidence that large-scale human behavioural imitation is a promising\ntool to create intelligent, interactive agents, and the challenge of reliably\nevaluating such agents is possible to surmount.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Dec 2020 13:55:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Jan 2021 03:25:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-22"}

However, collecting micro-sleep data during driving is inefficient and\nhas a high risk of obtaining poor data quality due to noisy driving situations.\nNight-sleep data at home is easier to collect than micro-sleep data during\ndriving. Therefore, we proposed a deep learning approach using night-sleep EEG\nto improve the performance of micro-sleep detection.

An extensive study of\nMn$_y$Ru$_x$Ga films on MgO (100) substrates with $1.8 \\leq y \\leq 2.6$ and $x\n= 0.5$, 0.7 or 0.9, including crystallographic, magnetic order,\nmagneto-transport and spin polarisation is undertaken to map specific\ncomposition-dependent properties in this versatile ternary system. A comparison\nof experimental densities obtained from X-ray reflectivity with calculated\ndensities indicates full site occupancy for all compositions, which implies\nchemical disorder. All moments lie on the Slater-Pauling plot with slope 1 and\nall except $x = 0.5$, $y = 2.2$ exhibit magnetic compensation at \\tcmp~below\n500~K. The coercivity near \\tcmp~exceeds 10~T. Increasing the Mn or Ru content\nraises \\tcmp, but increasing Ru also decreases the spin polarisation determined\nby point contact Andreev reflection. Molecular field theory is used to model\nthe temperature dependence of the net ferrimagnetic moment and three principal\nexchange coefficients are deduced. Marked differences in the shape of anomalous\nHall and net magnetisation hysteresis loops are explained by substantial\ncanting of the small net moment by up to \\SI{40}{\\degree} relative to the\n$c$-axis in zero field, which is a result of slight non-collinearity of the\nMn$^{4c}$ sublattice moments due to competing intra-sublattice exchange\ninteractions arising from antisite disorder and excess Mn in the unit cell.\nConsequences are reduced spin polarisation and an enhanced intrinsic\ncontribution to the anomalous Hall effect. The systematic investigation of the\nphysical properties as a function of $x$ and $y$ will guide the selection of\ncompositions to meet the requirements for magnonic and spintronic MRG-based\ndevices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Dec 2020 15:14:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Mar 2021 18:15:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 9 Apr 2021 14:30:26 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 12 Apr 2021 12:37:58 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 22 Apr 2021 18:27:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-18"}

We explain why\nexponentially small correlations in the radiation emitted by a black hole are\nsufficient to resolve the original paradox put forward by Hawking. We then\ndescribe a refinement of the paradox that makes essential reference to the\nblack-hole interior. This analysis leads to a broadly-applicable physical\nprinciple: in a theory of quantum gravity, a copy of all the information on a\nCauchy slice is also available near the boundary of the slice. This principle\ncan be made precise and established -- under weak assumptions, and using only\nlow-energy techniques -- in asymptotically global AdS and in four dimensional\nasymptotically flat spacetime. When applied to black holes, this principle\ntells us that the exterior of the black hole always retains a complete copy of\nthe information in the interior. We show that accounting for this redundancy\nprovides a resolution of the information paradox for evaporating black holes\nand, conversely, that ignoring this redundancy leads to paradoxes even in the\nabsence of black holes. We relate this perspective to recent computations of\nthe Page curve for holographic CFTs coupled to nongravitational baths. But we\nargue that such models may provide an inaccurate picture of the rate at which\ninformation can be extracted from evaporating black holes in asymptotically\nflat space. We discuss large black holes dual to typical states in AdS/CFT and\nthe new paradoxes that arise in this setting. These paradoxes also extend to\nthe eternal black hole. They can be resolved by assuming that the map between\nthe boundary CFT and the black-hole interior is state dependent. We discuss the\nconsistency of state-dependent bulk reconstructions.

Overloading an\naircraft with passengers and baggage might result in a safety hazard. In\ncontrast, not fully utilizing an aircraft's payload-carrying capacity\nundermines its operational efficiency and airline profitability. However,\naccurate determination of the aircraft mass for each operating flight is not\nfeasible because it is impractical to weigh each aircraft component, including\nthe payload. The existing methods for aircraft-mass estimation are dependent on\nthe aircraft- and engine-performance parameters, which are usually considered\nproprietary information. Moreover, the values of these parameters vary under\ndifferent operating conditions while those of others might be subject to large\nestimation errors. This paper presents a data-driven method involving use of\nthe quick access recorder (QAR)-a digital flight-data recorder-installed on all\naircrafts to record the initial aircraft climb mass during each flight. The\nmethod requires users to select appropriate parameters among several thousand\nothers recorded by the QAR using physical models. The selected data are\nsubsequently processed and provided as input to a multilayer perceptron neural\nnetwork for building the model for initial-climb aircraft-mass prediction.\nThus, the proposed method offers the advantages of both the model-based and\ndata-driven approaches for aircraft-mass estimation. Because this method does\nnot explicitly rely on any aircraft or engine parameter, it is universally\napplicable to all aircraft types. In this study, the proposed method was\napplied to a set of Boeing 777-300ER aircrafts, the results of which\ndemonstrated reasonable accuracy. Airlines can use this tool to better utilize\naircraft's payload.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Dec 2020 04:44:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-14"}

In contrast to the 2019 challenge, we focused our radiologist\nevaluations on pathological assessment in brain images. We also debuted a new\nTransfer track that required participants to submit models evaluated on MRI\nscanners from outside the training set. We received 19 submissions from eight\ndifferent groups. Results showed one team scoring best in both SSIM scores and\nqualitative radiologist evaluations. We also performed analysis on alternative\nmetrics to mitigate the effects of background noise and collected feedback from\nthe participants to inform future challenges. Lastly, we identify common\nfailure modes across the submissions, highlighting areas of need for future\nresearch in the MRI reconstruction community.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2020 19:20:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Dec 2020 05:18:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 3 May 2021 12:29:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-04"}

Currently, scenario-based approaches are investigated in research\nand industry, aiming at a reduction of testing efforts by specifying safety\nrelevant scenarios. To define those scenarios and operate in a complex\nreal-world design domain, a structured description of the environment is\nneeded. Within the PEGASUS research project, the 6-Layer Model (6LM) was\nintroduced for the description of highway scenarios. This paper refines the 6LM\nand extends it to urban traffic and environment. As defined in PEGASUS, the 6LM\nprovides the possibility to categorize the environment and, therefore,\nfunctions as a structured basis for subsequent scenario description. The model\nenables a structured description and categorization of the general environment,\nwithout incorporating any knowledge or anticipating any functions of actors.\nBeyond that, there is a variety of other applications of the 6LM, which are\nelaborated in this paper. The 6LM includes a description of the road network\nand traffic guidance objects, roadside structures, temporary modifications of\nthe former, dynamic objects, environmental conditions and digital information.\nThe work at hand specifies each layer by categorizing its items. Guidelines are\nformulated and explanatory examples are given to standardize the application of\nthe model for an objective environment description. In contrast to previous\npublications, the model and its design are described in far more detail.\nFinally, the holistic description of the 6LM presented includes remarks on\npossible future work when expanding the concept to machine perception aspects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2020 16:11:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 2021 16:39:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}

In this paper, we compile\nand test numerous approaches to defend against such adversarial attacks.

Theoretical mean-field\nmodels have been successful in explaining this property of the solar NSSL,\nwhile global direct convection models have been unsuccessful. We investigate\nreason for this discrepancy by measuring the mean flows, Reynolds stress, and\nturbulent transport coefficients under NSSL conditions. Simulations have\nminimal ingredients. These ingredients are inhomogeneity due to boundaries,\nanisotropic turbulence, and rotation. Parameters of the simulations are chosen\nsuch they match the weakly rotationally constrained NSSL. The simulations probe\nlocally Cartesian patches of the star at a given depth and latitude. The depth\nof the patch is varied by changing the rotation rate such that the resulting\nCoriolis numbers<1. We measure the turbulent transport coefficient relevant for\nthe non-diffusive and diffusive parts of the Reynolds stress and compare them\nwith predictions of current mean-field theories. A negative radial gradient of\nmean flow similar to the solar NSSL is generated only at the equator where\nmeridional flows are absent. At other latitudes the meridional flow is\ncomparable to the mean flow corresponding to differential rotation. We also\nfind that meridional components of the Reynolds stress cannot be ignored.\nAdditionally, we find that the turbulent viscosity is quenched by rotation by\nabout 50\\% from the surface to the bottom of the NSSL. Our local simulations do\nnot validate the explanation for the generation of the NSSL from mean-field\ntheory where meridional stresses are neglected. However, the rotational\ndependence of turbulent viscosity in our simulations is in good agreement with\ntheoretical prediction. Our results are in qualitative agreement with global\nconvection simulations in that a NSSL obtained near the equator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Dec 2020 14:45:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-01"}

Moreover, we apply our methods to a recent issue\n(Coronavirus diagnose). Several current studies indicate that lung Computed\nTomography (CT) images can be used for a fast and accurate COVID-19 diagnosis.\nHowever, the well-labeled training data cannot be easily accessed due to the\nnovelty of the disease and a number of privacy policies.

Finding a CNN architecture that can learn CA is\nequivalent to showing that a time-varying time-evolution operator can be\nrepresented as a finite composition of time-independent linear functions and\nReLU type non-linear functions. As a concrete example, block CA, which is time\nreversible and expressed as a matrix multiplication that changes with time,\nwill be used as the time-evolution law, and the CNN architecture that can learn\nthis evolution law will be proposed. However, by the universal approximation\ntheorem, even with data of arbitrary quantum systems, if the depth of the\nnetwork is deep enough, a CNN architecture that can learn actual rules can be\nfound, regardless of the Hamiltonian, and therefore, the time-evolution law can\nbe consistently expressed as a CNN. Also, since the convolution layer can be\nexpressed in a covariant form, it could be helpful to find a CNN architecture\nthat can learn the evolution law for a data set that includes gravity.\nMeanwhile, it will be shown that if the activation function of the first and\nlast hidden layer is bypass, the CNN can be trained to include the\ncorresponding part of the probabilistic interpretation in conventional quantum\nmechanics.

A\ndifferential equation that has only one independent variable is called an\nOrdinary Differential Equation (ODE), and all derivatives in it are taken with\nrespect to that variable. Most often, the variable is time, t; although, I will\nuse x in this paper as the independent variable. The differential equation\nwhere the unknown function depends on two or more variables is referred to as\nPartial Differential Equations (PDE). Ordinary differential equations can be\nsolved by a variety of methods, analytical and numerical. Although there are\nmany analytic methods for finding the solution of differential equations, there\nexist quite a number of differential equations that cannot be solved\nanalytically [8]. This means that the solution cannot be expressed as the sum\nof a finite number of elementary functions (polynomials, exponentials,\ntrigonometric, and hyperbolic functions). For simple differential equations, it\nis possible to find closed form solutions [9]. But many differential equations\narising in applications are so complicated that it is sometimes impractical to\nhave solution formulas; or at least if a solution formula is available, it may\ninvolve integrals that can be calculated only by using a numerical quadrature\nformula. In either case, numerical methods provide a powerful alternative tool\nfor solving the differential equations under the prescribed initial condition\nor conditions [9]. In this paper, I present the basic and commonly used\nnumerical and analytical methods of solving ordinary differential equations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Dec 2020 14:06:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-15"}

Currently, chest CT imaging is preferred as the\nprimary screening tool for evaluating the COVID-19 pneumonia by radiological\nimaging. However, CT imaging requires larger radiation doses, longer exposure\ntime, higher cost, and may suffer from patient movements. X-Ray imaging is a\nfast, cheap, more patient-friendly and available in almost every healthcare\nfacility.

However, there is no study using the artwork or painting of\nBangladeshi painters. Bangladeshi painting has a long history of more than two\nthousand years and is still being practiced by Bangladeshi painters. This study\ngenerates NST stylized image on Bangladeshi paintings and analyzes the human\npoint of view regarding the aesthetic preference of NST on Bangladeshi\npaintings. To assure our study's acceptance, we performed qualitative human\nevaluations on generated stylized images by 60 individual humans of different\nage and gender groups. We have explained how NST works for Bangladeshi\npaintings and assess NST algorithms, both qualitatively \\& quantitatively. Our\nstudy acts as a pre-requisite for the impact of NST stylized image using\nBangladeshi paintings on mobile UI/GUI and material translation from the human\nperspective. We hope that this study will encourage new collaborations to\ncreate more NST related studies and expand the use of Bangladeshi artworks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Dec 2020 15:22:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-14"}

The performances of the models were measured using both the\ndatasets and the combination of the two datasets. In order to achieve maximum\nefficiency, we used various augmentations, hyperparameter tuning, and\noptimizations techniques.

Identity Leakage in\n  Generative Models","comments":"To appear at WACV 2021","journal-ref":null,"doi":null,"report-no":null,"categories":"cs.CV","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","abstract":"  Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are able to generate high resolution\nphoto-realistic images of objects that \"do not exist.\" These synthetic images\nare rather difficult to detect as fake. However, the manner in which these\ngenerative models are trained hints at a potential for information leakage from\nthe supplied training data, especially in the context of synthetic faces. This\npaper presents experiments suggesting that identity information in face images\ncan flow from the training corpus into synthetic samples without any\nadversarial actions when building or using the existing model. This raises\nprivacy-related questions, but also stimulates discussions of (a) the face\nmanifold's characteristics in the feature space and (b) how to create\ngenerative models that do not inadvertently reveal identity information of real\nsubjects whose images were used for training. We used five different face\nmatchers (face_recognition, FaceNet, ArcFace, SphereFace and Neurotechnology\nMegaMatcher) and the StyleGAN2 synthesis model, and show that this identity\nleakage does exist for some, but not all methods. So, can we say that these\nsynthetically generated faces truly do not exist? Databases of real and\nsynthetically generated faces are made available with this paper to allow full\nreplicability of the results discussed in this work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Dec 2020 15:32:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-14"}
