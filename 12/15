The DSN extracts\nsalient and interpretable features in signals by cascading wavelet transforms,\ncomplex modulus and extract the representation of the data via a\ntranslation-invariant operator. First, leveraging the development of highly\nspecialized wavelet filters over the last decades, we propose a multi-family\napproach to DSN. In particular, we propose to cross multiple wavelet transforms\nat each layer of the network, thus increasing the feature diversity and\nremoving the need for an expert to select the appropriate filter. Secondly, we\ndevelop an optimal thresholding strategy adequate for the DSN that regularizes\nthe network and controls possible instabilities induced by the signals, such as\nnon-stationary noise. Our systematic and principled solution sparsifies the\nnetwork's latent representation by acting as a local mask distinguishing\nbetween activity and noise. The SMF-DSN enhances the DSN by (i) increasing the\ndiversity of the scattering coefficients and (ii) improves its robustness with\nrespect to non-stationary noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2020 16:06:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-15"}

What predicts\ncooperation in anonymous contexts is inconsistent across populations, levels of\nanalysis, and games. For instance, market integration is a key predictor across\nethnolinguistic groups but has inconsistent predictive power at the individual\nlevel. We adapt an idea from 19th-century sociology: people in societies with\ngreater overlap in ties across domains among community members (Durkheim's\n\"mechanical\" solidarity) will cooperate more with their network partners and\nless in anonymous contexts than people in societies with less overlap\n(\"organic\" solidarity). This hypothesis, which can be tested at the individual\nand community level, assumes that these two types of societies differ in the\nimportance of keeping existing relationships as opposed to recruiting new\npartners. Using multiplex networks, we test this idea by comparing cooperative\ntendencies in both anonymous experimental games and real-life communal labor\ntasks across 9 Makushi villages in Guyana that vary in the degree of\nwithin-village overlap. Average overlap in a village predicts both real-world\ncooperative and anonymous interactions in the predicted direction; individual\noverlap also has effects in the expected direction. These results reveal a\nconsistent patterning of cooperative tendencies at both individual and local\nlevels and contribute to the debate over the emergence of norms for cooperation\namong humans.

This process takes advantage of the crystal\nstructure and relative difference in etching rates between the (100) and (111)\nplanes such that we can produce parts that have surface errors < {\\lambda}/4.\nPrevious measurements indicate that chemical etching can yield a final etched\nblaze that slightly differs from the orientation of the (111) plane.

We show that, while dense molecular cloud gas-phase chemistry alone\nleads to very low fractionation, 14N atoms are preferentially depleted from the\ngas-phase due to a mass dependent grain surface sticking rate for atomic\nnitrogen.

For the quantum SVM under NISQ, we use quantum\nfeature maps to translate data into quantum states and build the SVM kernel out\nof these quantum states, and further compare with classical SVM with radial\nbasis function (RBF) kernels. As data sets are more complex or abstracted in\nsome sense, classical SVM with classical kernels leads to less accuracy\ncompared to QSVM, as classical SVM with typical classical kernels cannot easily\nseparate different class data. Similarly, QSVM should be able to provide\ncompetitive performance over a broader range of data sets including ``simpler''\ndata cases in which smoother decision boundaries are required to avoid any\nmodel variance issues (i.e., overfitting). To bridge the gap between\n``classical-looking'' decision boundaries and complex quantum decision\nboundaries, we propose to utilize general shallow unitary transformations to\ncreate feature maps with rotation factors to define a tunable quantum kernel,\nand added regularization to smooth the separating hyperplane model.

Kinetics teaches us that for a\nparticle to be cooled down by several orders of magnitude, it will typically\ntake many elastic collisions as each one only carries away a certain fraction\nof the collision energy. Recently, for a system consisting of hot ions and cold\natoms, a much faster cooling process has been suggested where cooling over\nseveral orders of magnitude can occur in a single step. Namely, in a\nhomo-nuclear atom-ion collision, an electron can resonantly hop from an\nultracold atom onto the hot ion, converting the cold atom into a cold ion.\nHere, we demonstrate such swap cooling in a direct way as we experimentally\nobserve how a single energetic ion loses energy in a cold atom cloud. In order\nto contrast swap cooling with standard sympathetic cooling, we perform the same\nmeasurements with a hetero-nuclear atom-ion system, for which swap cooling\ncannot take place, and indeed observe much different cooling dynamics. Ab\ninitio numerical model calculations agree well with our measured data and\ncorroborate our interpretations.

While this evolution is\ninstigated by Sagittarius, it is also driven by the intertwined influences of\nthe dark matter halo and the disc itself. We analyse an N-body simulation\nfollowing a Sagittarius-like galaxy interacting with a MW-like host to\ndisentangle these different influences during the stages of a minor merger. The\naccelerations in the disc plane from each component are calculated for each\nsnapshot in the simulation, and then decomposed into Fourier series on annuli.\nThe analysis maps quantify and compare the scales of the individual\ncontributions over space and through time: (i) accelerations due to the\nsatellite are only important around disc passages; (ii) the influence around\nthese passages is enhanced and extended by the distortion of the dark matter\nhalo; (iii) the interaction drives disc asymmetries within and perpendicular to\nthe plane and the self-gravity of these distortions increase in importance with\ntime eventually leading to the formation of a bar. These results have\ninteresting implications for identifying different influences within our own\nGalaxy. Currently, Sagittarius is close enough to a plane crossing to search\nfor localized signatures of its effect at intermediate radii, the distortion of\nthe MW's dark matter halo should leave its imprint in the outer disc and the\ndisc's own self-consistent response is sculpting the intermediate and inner\ndisc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2020 18:17:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 Oct 2021 05:08:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-11"}

It was\nassumed that a phenomenology for quantum-gravity effects that are triggered by\ncurvature might be a dead end because of a double suppression: by the smallness\nof the characteristic quantum-gravity length scale and by the smallness of\ncurvature. This state of affairs is becoming increasingly unsatisfactory in\nlight of some recent quantum-gravity studies providing evidence of the fact\nthat the presence of curvature might be required in order to have the novel\nrelativistic properties. We here analyze an explicit scenario for\ncurvature-induced quantum-gravity effects, and show that the smallness of\ncurvature does not pose a challenge for phenomenology since it is compensated\nby the large distances traveled by the particles considered in the relevant\nphenomenological studies.

This approach combines a magnified linear cavity with an\nintracavity Pockels cell. The Pockels cell introduces a voltage tunable\nbirefringence allowing the cavity mode frequencies to track the Raman lasers as\nthey scan to compensate for gravitationally induced Doppler shifts, removing\nthe dominant limitation of current cavity enhanced systems. A cavity is built\nto this geometry and shown to simultaneously realize the capability required\nfor Doppler compensation, with a 5.04~mm $1/e^{2}$ diameter beam waist and an\nenhancement factor of $>$5x at a finesse of 35. Furthermore, this has a tunable\nGouy phase, allowing the suppression of higher order spatial modes and the\navoidance of regions of instability. This approach can therefore enable\nenhanced contrast and longer atom interferometry times while also enabling the\nkey features of cavity enhanced atom interferometry, power enhancement and the\nreduction of aberrations.

However, the\nsteeply falling production spectrum introduces a strong bias toward small\nenergy losses that obfuscates a direct interpretation of the impact of medium\neffects in the measured jet ensemble. Modern machine learning techniques offer\nthe potential to tackle this issue on a jet-by-jet basis. In this paper, we\nemploy a convolutional neural network (CNN) to diagnose such modifications from\njet images where the training and validation is performed using the hybrid\nstrong/weak coupling model. By analyzing measured jets in heavy-ion collisions,\nwe extract the original jet transverse momentum, i.e., the transverse momentum\nof an identical jet that did not pass through a medium, in terms of an energy\nloss ratio. Despite many sources of fluctuations, we achieve good performance\nand put emphasis on the interpretability of our results. We observe that the\nangular distribution of soft particles in the jet cone and their relative\ncontribution to the total jet energy contain significant discriminating power,\nwhich can be exploited to tailor observables that provide a good estimate of\nthe energy loss ratio. With a well-predicted energy loss ratio, we study a set\nof jet observables to estimate their sensitivity to bias effects and reveal\ntheir medium modifications when compared to a more equivalent jet population,\ni.e., a set of jets with similar initial energy.

The model accounts for dissipative process under the assumption that\nviscoelastic losses are localized at the (micro)-contact lines. Numerical\npredictions are then compared with experimental measurements, which show a\nstrong adhesion hysteresis mostly due to viscous energy dissipation occurring\nduring pull-off. This hysteresis is satisfactorily described by the contact\nmodel which allows to distinguish the energy loss due to material dissipation\nfrom the adhesion hysteresis due to elastic instability. Our analysis shows\nthat the pull-off force required to detach the surfaces is strongly influenced\nby the detachment rate and the rms roughness amplitude, but it is almost\nunaffected by the maximum load from which unloading starts. Moreover, the\nincrease in the boundary line separating contact and non-contact regions,\nobserved when moving from smooth to rough contacts, negligibly affects the\nviscous dissipation. Such increase is much less significant than the reduction\nin contact area, which therefore is the main parameter governing the strong\ndecrease in the effective surface energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2020 18:32:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-15"}

Such microlensing can cause\npotentially observable beating patterns on the waveform due to waveform\nsuperposition and magnify the signal. On the one hand, the beating patterns and\nmagnification could lead to the first detection of a microlensed gravitational\nwave. On the other hand, microlensing introduces a systematic error in strong\nlensing use-cases, such as localization and cosmography studies. We show that\ndiffraction effects are important when we consider GWs in the LIGO frequency\nband lensed by objects with masses $\\lesssim 100 \\, \\rm M_\\odot$.

Moreover, these protocols can be reverted to\nreduce the amount of injected energy, while preserving the generated\nentanglement and making it more resilient to noise. We present the principle at\nwork, discuss its application in a variety of physical settings, including\nlevitated and tethered mechanical harmonic oscillators, and present example\napplications to Casimir and gravitational forces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2020 18:50:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Jun 2021 15:10:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-07"}

In this work, a dimensionality reduction technique is investigated\nto exploit flows presenting an homogeneous direction, such as wake flows of\nextruded two-dimensional (2-D) geometries. First, we examine the effect of the\nhomogeneous direction span on the wake turbulence dynamics of incompressible\nflow past a circular cylinder at $Re=10^4$. It is found that the presence of a\nsolid wall induces 3-D structures even in highly constricted domains. The 3-D\nstructures are rapidly two-dimensionalised by the large-scale K\\'{a}rm\\'{a}n\nvortices if the cylinder span is 50\\% of the diameter or less, as a result of\nthe span being shorter than the natural wake Mode B instability\nwavelength[...]. With this physical understanding, a 2-D data-driven model that\nincorporates 3-D effects, as found in the 3-D wake flow, is presented. The 2-D\nmodel is derived from a novel flow decomposition based on a local spanwise\naverage of the flow, yielding the spanwise-averaged Navier-Stokes (SANS)\nequations[...]. A machine-learning (ML) model is employed to provide closure to\nthe SANS equations. In the a-priori framework, the ML model yields accurate\npredictions of the SSR terms, in contrast to a standard eddy-viscosity model\nwhich completely fails to capture the closure term structures[...]. In the\na-posteriori analysis, while we find evidence of known stability issues with\nlong-time ML predictions for dynamical systems, the closed SANS equations are\nstill capable of predicting wake metrics and induced forces with errors from\n1-10%. This results in approximately an order of magnitude improvement over\nstandard 2-D simulations while reducing the computational cost of 3-D\nsimulations by 99.5%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2020 18:57:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-16"}

The initial fragment stream is extremely eccentric, while\nobservational evidence suggest that discs are circular or nearly so. Here we\npropose a novel mechanism to bridge this gap and show that the fragments can\nrapidly circularise through dust or gas drag when they interact with a\npre-existing compact disc. We assume that the tidal stream mainly consists of\nsmall cohesive fragments in the size range 10-1000 m, capable of resisting the\nWD tidal forces, whereas the compact discs span a wide mass range. We provide\nan analytical model, accompanied by N-body simulations, and find a large\nparameter space in fragment sizes and orbital separation that leads to full\ncircularization. Partial circularization is possible for compact discs that are\nseveral orders of magnitudes less massive. We show that dust-induced\ncircularization inherently produces gas as tidal fragments collisionally\nvaporize the pre-existing dust along their path. We show that ongoing gas\nproduction has a higher probability to occur during the early stages of tidal\ndisruption events, resulting from the fact that smaller fragments are the first\nto circularize. Intermittent gas production however becomes more likely as the\ntidal stream matures. This could explain why only a small subset of systems\nwith dusty compact discs also have an observed gaseous component.

Its isolation, extended star formation history (SFH), and recent\nperigalacticon passage (~1 Gyr ago) make Leo~I one of the most interesting\nnearby stellar systems. Here, we analyse deep photometric Hubble Space\nTelescope data via colour-magnitude diagram fitting techniques to study its\nglobal and radially-resolved SFH. We find global star formation enhancements in\nLeo I ~13, 5.5, 2.0, and 1.0 Gyr ago, after which it was substantially\nquenched. Within the context of previous works focused on Leo I, we interpret\nthe most ancient and the youngest ones as being linked to an early formation\n(surviving reionisation) and the latest perigalacticon passage (transition from\ndIrr to dSph), respectively. We clearly identify the presence of very metal\npoor stars ([Fe/H]~-2) ageing ~5-6 and ~13 Gyr old. We speculate with the\npossibility that this metal-poor population in Leo I is related to the merging\nwith a low mass system (possibly an ultra-faint dwarf). This event would have\ntriggered star formation (peak of star formation ~5.5 Gyr ago) and accumulated\nold, metal poor stars from the accreted system in LeoI. Some of the stars born\nduring this event would also form from accreted gas of low-metallicity (giving\nrise to the 5-6 Gyr low-metallicity tail). Given the intensity and extension of\nthe 2.0 Gyr burst, we hypothesise that this enhancement could also have an\nexternal origin. Despite the quenching of star formation around 1 Gyr ago (most\nprobably induced by ram pressure stripping with the Milky Way halo at\npericentre), we report the existence of stars as young as 300-500 Myr. We also\ndistinguish two clear spatial regions: the inner ~190 pc presents an\nhomogeneous stellar content (size of the gaseous star forming disc in LeoI from\n~4.5 to 1 Gyr ago), whereas the outer regions display a clear positive age\ngradient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2020 19:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-23"}

Specifically, at fixed maximum circular velocity,\n$V_{\\rm max}$, subhalos with smaller $r_{\\rm peri}$ are more concentrated (have\nsmaller $r_{\\rm max}$ values) and have lost more mass, with larger peak\ncircular velocities, $V_{\\rm peak}$, prior to infall. These trends provide\ninformation that can tighten constraints on the inferred $V_{\\rm max}$ and\n$V_{\\rm peak}$ values for known Milky Way satellites. We illustrate this using\npublished pericenter estimates enabled by Gaia for the nine classical Milky Way\ndwarf spheroidal satellites. The two densest dSph satellites (Draco and Ursa\nMinor) have relatively small pericenters, and this pushes their inferred\n$r_{\\rm max}$ and $V_{\\rm max}$ values lower than they would have been without\npericenter information. For Draco, we infer $V_{\\rm max} = 23.5 \\, \\pm 3.3$ km\ns$^{-1}$ (compared to $27.3 \\, \\pm 7.1$ km s$^{-1}$ without pericenter\ninformation).

We propose a combined power-law integrated sensitivity (CPLS) curve\ncombining GW experiments over different frequency bands, which shows the\nmidband improves sensitivity to SGWBs by up to two orders of magnitude at\n$10^{-2} - 10$ Hz.

We explicitly model\nvarious astrophysical SGWB sources, most importantly from unresolved black hole\nmergers. Using Markov Chain Monte Carlo, we demonstrated that midband\nexperiments can, when combined with LIGO A+ and LISA, significantly improve\nsensitivities to cosmological SGWBs and better separate them from astrophysical\nSGWBs. In particular, we forecast that a midband experiment improves\nsensitivity to cosmic string tension $G\\mu$ by up to a factor of $10$, driven\nby improved component separation from astrophysical sources. For phase\ntransitions, a midband experiment can detect signals peaking at $0.1 - 1$ Hz,\nwhich for our fiducial model corresponds to early Universe temperatures of\n$T_*\\sim 10^4 - 10^6$ GeV, generally beyond the reach of LIGO and LISA.

According to the standard picture, they are launched at accretion disc\nscales with relativistic velocities, up to 0.3-0.4 c. Their high kinetic power\nis enough to induce an efficient feedback on galactic-scale, possibly\ncontributing to the co-evolution between the central supermassive black hole\n(SMBH) and the host galaxy. It is therefore of paramount importance to fully\nunderstand the UFO physics, in particular the forces driving their acceleration\nand the relation with the accretion flow they originate from. In this paper we\ninvestigate the impact of special relativity effects on the radiative pressure\nexerted onto the outflow. The radiation received by the wind decreases for\nincreasing outflow velocity v, implying that the standard Eddington limit\nargument has to be corrected according to v. Due to the limited ability of the\nradiation to counteract the SMBH gravity, we expect to find lower typical\nvelocities with respect to the non-relativistic scenario. We integrate the\nrelativistic-corrected outflow equation of motion for a realistic set of\nstarting conditions. We concentrate on UFO typical values of ionisation, column\ndensity and launching radius. We explore a one-dimensional, spherical geometry\nand a 3D setting with a rotating thin accretion disc. We find that the\ninclusion of relativistic effects leads to sizeable differences in the wind\ndynamics and that v is reduced up to 50% with respect to the non-relativistic\ntreatment. We compare our results with a sample of UFO from the literature, and\nwe find that the relativistic-corrected velocities are systematically lower\nthan the reported ones, indicating the need for an additional mechanism, such\nas magnetic driving, to explain the highest velocity components.

This theory is a generalization of an existing theory for predicting the\nperformance of Echo State Networks and connectionist models for symbolic\nreasoning known as Vector Symbolic Architectures. In this paper, we first show\nthat the proposed perceptron theory can predict the performance of Echo State\nNetworks, which could not be described by the previous theory. Second, we apply\nour perceptron theory to the last layers of shallow randomly connected and deep\nmulti-layer networks. The full theory is based on Gaussian statistics, but it\nis analytically intractable. We explore numerical methods to predict network\nperformance for problems with a small number of classes. For problems with a\nlarge number of classes, we investigate stochastic sampling methods and a\ntractable approximation to the full theory. The quality of predictions is\nassessed in three experimental settings, using reservoir computing networks on\na memorization task, shallow randomly connected networks on a collection of\nclassification datasets, and deep convolutional networks with the ImageNet\ndataset. This study offers a simple, bipartite approach to understand deep\nneural networks: the input is encoded by the last-but-one layers into a\nhigh-dimensional representation. This representation is mapped through the\nweights of the last layer into the postsynaptic sums of the output neurons.\nSpecifically, the proposed perceptron theory uses the mean vector and\ncovariance matrix of the postsynaptic sums to compute classification accuracies\nfor the different classes.

The robots are equipped with individual sensors that\nallow them to continuously learn a grid map of the unknown environment using\nexisting Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) methods. The goal of the\nrobots is to accomplish complex collaborative tasks, captured by global Linear\nTemporal Logic (LTL) formulas. The majority of existing LTL planning approaches\nrely on discrete abstractions of the robot dynamics operating in known\nenvironments and, as a result, they cannot be applied to the more realistic\nscenarios where the environment is initially unknown. In this paper, we address\nthis novel challenge by proposing the first reactive, abstraction-free, and\ndistributed LTL planning algorithm that can be applied for complex mission\nplanning of multiple robots operating in unknown environments. The proposed\nalgorithm is reactive, i.e., planning is adapting to the updated environmental\nmap and abstraction-free as it does not rely on designing abstractions of the\nrobot dynamics. Also, our algorithm is distributed in the sense that the global\nLTL task is decomposed into single-agent reachability problems constructed\nonline based on the continuously learned map. The proposed algorithm is\ncomplete under mild assumptions on the structure of the environment and the\nsensor models. We provide extensive numerical simulations and hardware\nexperiments that illustrate the theoretical analysis and show that the proposed\nalgorithm can address complex planning tasks for large-scale multi-robot\nsystems in unknown environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2020 19:51:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-16"}

A number of recent approaches propose to\novercome this bottleneck through compression of gradient updates. However, as\nmodels become larger, so does the size of the gradient updates. In this paper,\nwe propose an alternate approach to learn from distributed data that quantizes\ndata instead of gradients, and can support learning over applications where the\nsize of gradient updates is prohibitive. Our approach leverages the dependency\nof the computed gradient on data samples, which lie in a much smaller space in\norder to perform the quantization in the smaller dimension data space. At the\ncost of an extra gradient computation, the gradient estimate can be refined by\nconveying the difference between the gradient at the quantized data point and\nthe original gradient using a small number of bits. Lastly, in order to save\ncommunication, our approach adds a layer that decides whether to transmit a\nquantized data sample or not based on its importance for learning. We analyze\nthe convergence of the proposed approach for smooth convex and non-convex\nobjective functions and show that we can achieve order optimal convergence\nrates with communication that mostly depends on the data rather than the model\n(gradient) dimension.

The idea is to use an l0\npenalization scheme with second-generation p-values (SGPV), instead of\ntraditional ones, to determine which variables remain in a model.

In this paper we present the first systematic study of\nthe CO properties of AGN hosts at z~2 for a sample of 27 X-ray selected AGN\nspanning two orders of magnitude in AGN bolometric luminosity (Lbol=\n10^44.7-10^46.9 erg/s) by using ALMA Band 3 observations of the CO(3-2)\ntransition (~1\" angular resolution). To search for evidence of AGN feedback on\nthe CO properties of the host galaxies, we compared our AGN with a sample of\ninactive (i.e., non-AGN) galaxies from the PHIBSS survey with similar redshift,\nstellar masses, and SFRs. We used the same CO transition as a consistent proxy\nfor the gas mass for the two samples in order to avoid systematics involved\nwhen assuming conversion factors. By adopting a Bayesian approach to take upper\nlimits into account, we analyzed CO luminosities as a function of stellar\nmasses and SFRs, as well as the ratio LCO(3-2)/M* (proxy for the gas fraction).\nThe two samples show statistically consistent trends in the LCO(3-2)-Lfir and\nLCO(3-2)-M* planes. However, there are indications that AGN feature lower\nCO(3-2) luminosities (0.4-0.7 dex) than inactive galaxies at the 2-3sigma level\nwhen we focus on the subset of parameters where the results are better\nconstrained and on the distribution of the mean LCO(3-2)/M*. Therefore, even by\nconservatively assuming the same excitation factor r31, we would find lower\nmolecular gas masses in AGN, and assuming higher r31 would exacerbate this\ndifference. We interpret our result as a hint of the potential effect of AGN\nactivity (e.g., radiation and outflows), which may be able to heat, excite,\ndissociate, and/or deplete the gas reservoir of the host galaxies.

The two interfaces also\nexhibit different chemical gradients, with the BFO/LSMO interface being\nSr-terminated by a spectroscopically distinctive high binding energy component\nin Sr 2p core-level spectra, which is spatially contained within 1 unit cell\nfrom the interface. From the electronic point of view, unique valence band\nfeatures were observed for bulk-BFO, bulk-LSMO and their interfaces. Our X-ray\noptical analysis revealed a unique electronic signature at the BFO/LSMO\ninterface, which we attribute to the coupling between those respective layers.\nValence band decomposition based on the Bragg-reflection standing-wave\nmeasurement also revealed the band alignment between BFO and LSMO layers. Our\nwork demonstrates that standing-wave hard x-ray photoemission is a reliable\nnon-destructive technique for probing depth-resolved electronic structure of\nburied layers and interfaces with sub-unit-cell resolution. Equivalent\ninvestigations can be successfully applied to a broad class of material such as\nperovskite complex oxides with emergent interfacial phenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2020 22:52:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-16"}

However,\nother rotational states are possible, particularly when higher eccentricity\norbits can be maintained in a system, including spin-orbit resonant\nconfigurations. Additionally, the oscillating strain as a planet moves from\nperiastron to apoastron results in friction and tidal heating, which can be an\nimportant energy source. Here, we simulate the climate of ocean-covered planets\nnear the inner edge of the habitable zone around M to solar stars with\nROCKE-3D, and leverage the planetary evolution software package, VPLanet, to\ncalculate tidal heating rates for Earth-sized planets orbiting 2600 K and 3000\nK stars. This study is the first to use a 3-D General Circulation Model that\nimplements tidal heating to investigate habitability for multiple resonant\nstates. We find that in the absence of tidal heating, the resonant state has\nlittle impact on the inner edge, because for a given stellar flux, higher-order\nstates tend to be warmer than synchronous rotators, but for a given\ntemperature, have drier upper atmospheres. However, when strong tidal heating\nis present, the rotational component implies a strong dependence of habitable\nconditions on the system evolution and rotational state. Since tidal and\nstellar heating both decrease with orbital distance, this results in a compact\norbital width separating temperate and uninhabitable climates. We summarize\nthese results and also compare ROCKE-3D to previously published simulations of\nthe inner edge that used a modified version of the NCAR CAM4 model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2020 22:57:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-17"}

The objective of this paper is to discover company- and\ncompetitor-specific intelligence from OCR using an unsupervised text analytics\napproach. First, the key aspects (or topics) discussed in the OCR are extracted\nusing three topic models - probabilistic latent semantic analysis (pLSA) and\ntwo variants of Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA-VI and LDA-GS). Subsequently,\nwe propose an ensemble-assisted topic model (EA-TM), which integrates the\nindividual topic models, to classify each review sentence to the most\nrepresentative aspect. Likewise, to determine the sentiment corresponding to a\nreview sentence, an ensemble sentiment analyzer (E-SA), which combines the\npredictions of three opinion mining methods (AFINN, SentiStrength, and VADER),\nis developed. An aspect-based opinion summary (AOS), which provides a snapshot\nof passenger-perceived strengths and weaknesses of an airline, is established\nby consolidating the sentiments associated with each aspect. Furthermore, a\nbi-gram analysis of the labeled OCR is employed to perform root cause analysis\nwithin each identified aspect. A case study involving 99,147 airline reviews of\na US-based target carrier and four of its competitors is used to validate the\nproposed approach.

While these communication\nnetworks are designed to be highly available with continuous uptime, there may\nbe times when an end-user experiences little or no access to network\nconnectivity.\n  The growing interest in digital forms of payments has led central banks\naround the world to explore the possibility of issuing a new type of\ncentral-bank money, known as central bank digital currency (CBDC). To\nfacilitate the secure issuance and transfer of CBDC, we envision a CBDC design\nunder a two-tier hierarchical trust infrastructure, which is implemented using\npublic-key cryptography with the central bank as the root certificate authority\nfor generating digital signatures, and other financial institutions as\nintermediate certificate authorities. One important design feature for CBDC\nthat can be developed under this hierarchical trust infrastructure is an\noffline capability to create secure point-to-point offline payments through the\nuse of authorized hardware. An offline capability for CBDC as digital cash can\ncreate a resilient payment system for consumers and businesses to transact in\nany situation.\n  We propose an offline payment system (OPS) protocol for CBDC that allows a\nuser to make digital payments to another user while both users are temporarily\noffline and unable to connect to payment intermediaries (or even the Internet).\nOPS can be used to instantly complete a transaction involving any form of\ndigital currency over a point-to-point channel without communicating with any\npayment intermediary, achieving virtually unbounded throughput and real-time\ntransaction latency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2020 23:22:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-16"}

These predicted masks along with derivative features are used to\nclassify image attributes that are passed onto the next stage to assimilate the\ngameplay understanding. Our end-to-end model yields an accuracy of ~95% for the\nmain bet detection and ~97% for card detection in a controlled environment\ntrained using transfer learning approach with 900 training examples. Our\napproach is generalizable and scalable and shows promising results in varied\ngaming scenarios and test data. Such granular level gathered data, helped in\nunderstanding player's deviation from optimum strategy and thereby separate the\nskill of the player from the luck of the game. Our system also assesses the\nlikelihood of card counting by correlating the player's betting pattern to the\ndeck's scaled count. Such a system lets casinos flag fraudulent activity and\ncalculate expected personalized profitability for each player and tailor their\nmarketing reinvestment decisions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2020 23:46:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-16"}

In this paper, we\ninvestigate the extent to which neural models can reason about natural language\nrationales that explain model predictions, relying only on distant supervision\nwith no additional annotation cost for human-written rationales. We investigate\nmultiple ways to automatically generate rationales using pre-trained language\nmodels, neural knowledge models, and distant supervision from related tasks,\nand train generative models capable of composing explanatory rationales for\nunseen instances. We demonstrate our approach on the defeasible inference task,\na nonmonotonic reasoning task in which an inference may be strengthened or\nweakened when new information (an update) is introduced. Our model shows\npromises at generating post-hoc rationales explaining why an inference is more\nor less likely given the additional information, however, it mostly generates\ntrivial rationales reflecting the fundamental limitations of neural language\nmodels. Conversely, the more realistic setup of jointly predicting the update\nor its type and generating rationale is more challenging, suggesting an\nimportant future direction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2020 23:50:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-16"}

Direct access to the shower muon content allows for\nthe study of both of the composition of primary cosmic rays and of high-energy\nhadronic interactions in the forward direction. As the muon density can vary\nbetween tens of muons per m$^2$ close to the intersection of the shower axis\nwith the ground to much less than one per m$^2$ when far away, the necessary\nbroad dynamic range is achieved by the simultaneous implementation of two\nacquisition modes in the read-out electronics: the binary mode, tuned to count\nsingle muons, and the ADC mode, suited to measure a high number of them. In\nthis work, we present the end-to-end calibration of the muon detector modules:\nfirst, the SiPMs are calibrated by means of the binary channel, and then, the\nADC channel is calibrated using atmospheric muons, detected in parallel to the\nshower data acquisition.

Standard machine learning approaches alleviate these concerns by\napplying a normalization scheme to the matrix of covariates, scaling all values\nto sit within some interval (such as the unit simplex).

The atmospheric\nconditions fuel the ocean circulation and its variability, but the extent to\nwhich ocean processes can affect the atmosphere at decadal time scales remains\nunclear. In particular, such low-frequency variability is difficult to extract\nfrom the short observational record, meaning that climate models are the\nprimary tools deployed to resolve this question. Here, we assess how the\nocean's intrinsic variability leads to patterns of upper-ocean heat content\nthat vary at decadal time scales. These patterns have the potential to feed\nback on the atmosphere and thereby affect climate modes of variability, such as\nEl Ni\\~no or the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation. We use the output from a\nglobal ocean-sea ice circulation model at three different horizontal\nresolutions, each driven by the same atmospheric reanalysis. To disentangle the\nvariability of the ocean's direct response to atmospheric forcing from the\nvariability due to intrinsic ocean dynamics, we compare model runs driven with\ninter-annually varying forcing (1958-2018) and model runs driven with\nrepeat-year forcing. Models with coarse resolution that rely on eddy\nparameterizations, show (i) significantly reduced variance of the upper-ocean\nheat content at decadal time scales and (ii) differences in the spatial\npatterns of low-frequency variability compared with higher resolution models.\nClimate projections are typically done with general circulation models with\ncoarse-resolution ocean components. Therefore, these biases affect our ability\nto predict decadal climate modes of variability and, in turn, hinder climate\nprojections. Our results suggest that for improving climate projections, the\ncommunity should move towards coupled climate models with higher oceanic\nresolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2020 00:52:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Mar 2021 20:05:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 13 Jun 2021 22:53:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-08"}

Yet, while the notion of width has become\npart of the state-of-the-art planning algorithms like BFWS, there is still no\ngood explanation for why so many benchmark domains have bounded width. In this\nwork, we address this question by relating bounded width and serialized width\nto ideas of generalized planning, where general policies aim to solve multiple\ninstances of a planning problem all at once. We show that bounded width is a\nproperty of planning domains that admit optimal general policies in terms of\nfeatures that are explicitly or implicitly represented in the domain encoding.\nThe results are extended to much larger class of domains with bounded\nserialized width where the general policies do not have to be optimal.

It has been\nsuggested that in this case post-linear corrections to the evolution of small\nfluctuations would result, for the standard $\\Lambda$-dominated cold DM (CDM)\nmodel, in delayed formation of early objects as supersonic advection flows\ndevelop after recombination, so baryons are not immediately captured by the DM\ngravity on small scales. We develop the hydrodynamical description of such\ntwo-component advection and show that, in the supersonic regime, the advection\nwithin irrotational fluids is governed by the gradient of the difference of the\nkinetic energies of the two (DM and baryonic here) components. We then apply\nthis formalism to the case where DM is made up of LIGO-type black holes (BHs)\nand show that there the advection process on scales relevant for early\nstructure collapse will differ significantly from the earlier discussed (CDM)\ncase because of the additional granulation component to the density field\nproduced during inflation. The advection here will lead efficiently to the\ncommon motion of the DM and baryon components on scales relevant for collapse\nand formation of first luminous sources.This leads to early collapse making\neasier to explain the existence of supermassive BHs observed in quasars at high\n$z>7$.

In stead of a single\ndepth network as used in conventional paradigms, we propose an extra semantic\nsegmentation branch to offer extra contextual features for depth estimation.\nBased on this framework, we enhance the local feature representation by\nsampling and feeding the point-based features that locate on the semantic edges\nto an individual Semantic-guided Edge Enhancement module (SEEM), which is\nspecifically designed for promoting depth estimation on the challenging\nsemantic borders.

Mixed\nsupervision could mitigate this difficulty, with a small fraction of the data\ncontaining complete pixel-wise annotations, while the rest being less\nsupervised, e.g., only a handful of pixels are labeled. In this work, we\npropose a dual-branch architecture, where the upper branch (teacher) receives\nstrong annotations, while the bottom one (student) is driven by limited\nsupervision and guided by the upper branch. In conjunction with a standard\ncross-entropy over the labeled pixels, our novel formulation integrates two\nimportant terms: (i) a Shannon entropy loss defined over the less-supervised\nimages, which encourages confident student predictions at the bottom branch;\nand (ii) a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, which transfers the knowledge from\nthe predictions generated by the strongly supervised branch to the\nless-supervised branch, and guides the entropy (student-confidence) term to\navoid trivial solutions. Very interestingly, we show that the synergy between\nthe entropy and KL divergence yields substantial improvements in performances.\nFurthermore, we discuss an interesting link between Shannon-entropy\nminimization and standard pseudo-mask generation and argue that the former\nshould be preferred over the latter for leveraging information from unlabeled\npixels.

The expansion velocity of the\nblueshifted bow shock traced by the 22 GHz H2O masers was 28 km s-1\ncorresponding to a dynamical timescale of 60 years. The direction of the maser\noutflow is slightly tilted compared with the radio jet, which could suggest a\nmore recent ejection episode during the accretion burst event. The total flux\ndensity of the 22 GHz H2O masers has gradually increased from early 2017 and\nhas become almost constant in 2018. For the first time, we reveal extended H2O\nmaser emission at 22 GHz in a star forming region, which is partly resolved out\nby VERA and even by the most extended VLA configurations.

The survival probability of a GC increases\nrapidly with the radial distance at which it formed ($r_{\\rm init}$): it is 37\nper cent for GCs with $r_{\\rm init} \\leq 1$ kpc and 92 per cent for GCs with\n$r_{\\rm init} \\geq 1$ kpc. The present-day radial distribution of GCs in\nE-MOSAICS turns out to be indistinguishable from that in Fornax, demonstrating\nthat, contrary to claims in the literature, the presence of five GCs in the\ncentral kiloparsec of Fornax does not exclude a cuspy DM halo.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2020 03:13:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-18"}

We verify the\nresulting formula with an all-sky observation using the Murchison Widefield\nArray (MWA) telescope. Methods: The sensitivity expression is developed from\nfirst principles by applying the concept of System Equivalent Flux Density\n(SEFD) to a polarimetric radio interferometer not by computing $A_e/T_{sys}$.\nThe SEFD is calculated from the standard deviation of the noisy flux density\nestimate for a target source due to system noise. Results: The SEFD for a\npolarimetric radio interferometer is generally not $1/\\sqrt{2}$ of a\nsingle-polarized interferometer as is often assumed for narrow FoV. This\nassumption can lead to significant errors for a dual-polarized dipole based\nsystem, which is common in low-frequency radio astronomy: up to $\\sim 15\\%$ for\na zenith angle (ZA) coverage of $45^\\circ$, and up to $\\sim45\\%$ for $60^\\circ$\ncoverage.

NLC is bell-shaped, with its peak occurring at a\nvoltage, Vh, where sensor charge is equally distributed across the plasma\nmembrane. Thus, Vh provides information on the conformational state of prestin.\nVh is sensitive to membrane tension, shifting to positive voltage as tension\nincreases and is the basis for considering prestin piezoelectric (PZE).

At a particular frequency, Fis, the complex\ncomponent magnitudes intersect. Using this metric, Fis, which depends on the\nfrequency response of each complex component, we find that initial Vh\ninfluences Fis; thus, by categorizing patches into groups of different Vh,\n(above and below -30 mV) we find that Fis is lower for the negative Vh group.\nWe also find that the effect of membrane tension on complex NLC is dependent,\nbut differentially so, on initial Vh. Whereas the negative group exhibits\nshifts to higher frequencies for increasing tension, the opposite occurs for\nthe positive group. Despite complex component trade-offs, the low-pass roll-off\nin absolute magnitude of NLC, which varies little with our perturbations and is\nindicative of diminishing total charge movement, poses a challenge for a role\nof voltage-driven prestin in cochlear amplification at very high frequencies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2020 04:54:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Dec 2020 00:52:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-27"}

A cost-effective reserve deployment and\nuncertainty pricing mechanism are critical to deal with the uncertainty and\nvariability of RES. To this end, this paper proposes a novel locational\nmarginal pricing mechanism in day-ahead market for managing uncertainties from\nRES. Firstly, an improved multi-ellipsoidal uncertainty set (IMEUS) considering\nthe temporal correlation and conditional correlation of wind power forecast is\nformulated to better capture the uncertainty of wind power. The dimension of\neach ellipsoidal subset is optimized based on a comprehensive evaluation index\nto reduce the invalid region without large loss of modeling accuracy, so as to\nreduce the conservatism. Then, an IMEUS-based robust unit commitment (RUC)\nmodel and a robust economic dispatch (RED) model are established for the\nday-ahead market clearing. Both the reserve cost and ramping constraints are\nconsidered in the overall dispatch process. Furthermore, based on the\nLangrangian function of the RED model, a new locational marginal pricing\nmechanism is developed. The uncertainty locational marginal price (ULMP) is\nintroduced to charge the RES for its uncertainties and reward the generators\nwho provide reserve to mitigate uncertainties. The new pricing mechanism can\nprovide effective price signals to incentivize the uncertainty management in\nthe day-ahead market.

Those systems\nare often characterized by a pair of multivariate datasets. To detect anomaly\nin such a system and localize element(s) associated with anomaly, one would\nneed to estimate scores that quantify anomalousness of the entire system as\nwell as its elements. However, it is not trivial to estimate such scores by\nconsidering changes of relationships between the elements, which strongly\ncorrelate with each other. Moreover, it is necessary to estimate the scores for\nthe entire system and its elements from a single framework, in order to\nidentify relationships among the scores for localizing elements associated with\nanomaly. Here, we developed a new method to quantify anomalousness of an entire\nsystem and its elements simultaneously.\n  The purpose of this paper is threefold. The first one is to propose a new\nanomaly detection method: Double Kernelized Scoring (DKS). DKS is a unified\nframework for entire-system anomaly scoring and element-wise anomaly scoring.\nTherefore, DKS allows for conducting simultaneously 1) anomaly detection for\nthe entire system and 2) localization for identifying faulty elements\nresponsible for the system anomaly. The second purpose is to propose a new\nkernel function: Matrix Kernel. The Matrix Kernel is defined between general\nmatrices, which might have different dimensions, allowing for conducting\nanomaly detection on systems where the number of elements change over time. The\nthird purpose is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method\nexperimentally. We evaluated the proposed method with synthetic and real time\nseries data. The results demonstrate that DKS is able to detect anomaly and\nlocalize the elements associated with it successfully.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2020 05:25:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-16"}

In order to reduce the computational cost, we propose an annealing\nmechanism, Amata, to reduce the overhead associated with adversarial training.\nThe proposed Amata is provably convergent, well-motivated from the lens of\noptimal control theory and can be combined with existing acceleration methods\nto further enhance performance. It is demonstrated that on standard datasets,\nAmata can achieve similar or better robustness with around 1/3 to 1/2 the\ncomputational time compared with traditional methods. In addition, Amata can be\nincorporated into other adversarial training acceleration algorithms (e.g.\nYOPO, Free, Fast, and ATTA), which leads to further reduction in computational\ntime on large-scale problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2020 06:27:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Mar 2021 20:37:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 13 Aug 2021 22:34:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-17"}

A large amount of building energy is used for heating, cooling,\nventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC). However, compared to its importance,\nbuilding energy management systems nowadays are limited in controlling HVAC\nbased on simple rule-based control (RBC) technologies. The ability to design\nsystems that can efficiently manage HVAC can reduce energy usage and greenhouse\ngas emissions, and, all in all, it can help us to mitigate climate change. This\npaper proposes predictive time-series models of occupancy patterns using LSTM.\nPrediction signal for future room occupancy status on the next time span (e.g.,\nnext 30 minutes) can be directly used to operate HVAC. For example, based on\nthe prediction and considering the time for cooling or heating, HVAC can be\nturned on before the room is being used (e.g., turn on 10 minutes earlier).\nAlso, based on the next room empty prediction timing, HVAC can be turned off\nearlier, and it can help us increase the efficiency of HVAC while not\ndecreasing comfort. We demonstrate our approach's capabilities using real-world\nenergy data collected from multiple rooms of a university building.

Traditionally, modal noise is reduced\nby agitating or \"shaking\" the fiber. This way, the light propagating in the\nfiber is redistributed over many different modes. However, in case of fibers\nwith only a limited number of modes, e.g. at near-infrared wavelengths or in\nadaptive-optics assisted systems, this method becomes very inefficient. The\nstrong agitation that would be needed stresses the fiber and could lead to\nfocal ratio degradation, or worse, to damaging the fiber. As an alternative\napproach, we propose to make use of a classic optical double scrambler, a\ndevice that is already implemented in many high-precision radial-velocity\nspectrographs, to mitigate the effect of modal noise by rotating the\nscrambler's first fiber end during each exposure. Because of the rotating\nillumination pattern of the scrambler's second fiber, the modes that are\nexcited vary continuously. This leads to very efficient averaging of the modal\npattern at the fiber exit and to a strong reduction of modal noise. In this\ncontribution, we present a prototype design and preliminary laboratory results\nof the rotating double scrambler.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2020 06:39:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-16"}

These methods can aggregate\ninformation from neighboring nodes but may also bring noise from neighbors.\nMost recently, several researchers attempted to compare neighboring nodes in\npairs to enhance the entity alignment. However, they ignored the relations\nbetween entities which are also important for neighborhood matching. In\naddition, existing methods paid less attention to the positive interactions\nbetween the entity alignment and the relation alignment. To deal with these\nissues, we propose a novel Relation-aware Neighborhood Matching model named RNM\nfor entity alignment. Specifically, we propose to utilize the neighborhood\nmatching to enhance the entity alignment. Besides comparing neighbor nodes when\nmatching neighborhood, we also try to explore useful information from the\nconnected relations. Moreover, an iterative framework is designed to leverage\nthe positive interactions between the entity alignment and the relation\nalignment in a semi-supervised manner. Experimental results on three real-world\ndatasets demonstrate that the proposed model RNM performs better than\nstate-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2020 07:22:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-16"}

Many regularization strategies have been proposed to\nmitigate the phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting.

We investigate systems with\ndifferent types of elementary spin degrees of freedom (three-state Potts, XY,\nand Heisenberg spins) which all exhibit characteristic subsystem symmetries and\nfracton-like excitations. The mobility constraints of isolated fractons and\nbound fracton pairs in the three-state Potts model are, however, strikingly\ndifferent compared to the known type-I or type-II fracton models.

Our extensive classical Monte-Carlo\nsimulations further indicate a crossover into a low temperature glassy phase\nwhere the system gets trapped in metastable fracton states. Moving on to XY\nspins, we find that in addition to fractons the system hosts fractional vortex\nexcitations. As a result of the restricted mobility of both types of defects,\nour classical Monte-Carlo simulations do not indicate a Kosterlitz-Thouless\ntransition but again show a crossover into a glassy low-temperature regime.\nFinally, the energy barriers associated with fractons vanish in the case of\nHeisenberg spins, such that defect states may continuously decay into a ground\nstate. These decays, however, exhibit a power-law relaxation behavior which\nleads to slow equilibration dynamics at low temperatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2020 09:36:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-11"}

However, most methods are designed for\nverification of an idealized model of the actual network which works over real\narithmetic and ignores rounding imprecisions. This idealization is in stark\ncontrast to network quantization, which is a technique that trades numerical\nprecision for computational efficiency and is, therefore, often applied in\npractice. Neglecting rounding errors of such low-bit quantized neural networks\nhas been shown to lead to wrong conclusions about the network's correctness.\nThus, the desired approach for verifying quantized neural networks would be one\nthat takes these rounding errors into account. In this paper, we show that\nverifying the bit-exact implementation of quantized neural networks with\nbit-vector specifications is PSPACE-hard, even though verifying idealized\nreal-valued networks and satisfiability of bit-vector specifications alone are\neach in NP. Furthermore, we explore several practical heuristics toward closing\nthe complexity gap between idealized and bit-exact verification.

This voltage is generated by a\nprocess which is termed spin hydrodynamic generation (SHDG), a result of the\ncollective electron spin--coupling to the vorticity field in the laminar flow\nin combination with an inverse spin-Hall effect. We study this phenomenon in\nlaminar duct flows with different width-to-height aspect ratios ranging from 1\n(square ducts) to infinite (two dimensional channels). First, we analytically\nsolve the governing Valet-Fert spin diffusion equations for the SHDG by means\nof the method of small parameters together with proper boundary conditions for\nthe set of inhomogeneous elliptic partial differential equations. Secondly, the\nproposed linear scaling law is validated through a series of experiments using\ncapillary tubes with rectangular and square cross-sections. The experimental\nresults show a very good agreement to the analytically found scaling law. A\nsubsequent substitution of the bulk velocity of the laminar wall-bounded flows\nby the pressure drop reveals a universal scaling law for the electrical voltage\nthat incorporates all pipe and duct geometries which we could study in our\nexperiments. Finally, the efficiency of the system is estimated for circular\npipes, rectangular and square ducts. This study shows that the efficiency of a\nspin hydrodynamic generator is the same for a circular pipe and a square duct\nwith the same diameter and height, respectively. Hence, due to the ease of\nmanufacturing and the possibility to scale the experiments up to parallel\nsettings in a compact form, micro-channels with a square cross-section seem to\nbe the optimum for a spin hydrodynamic generator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2020 10:11:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-05"}

One example is the\nregistration of 2D X-ray images with preoperative three-dimensional computed\ntomography (CT) images in intraoperative surgical guidance systems. Due to the\nhigh safety requirements in medical applications, estimating registration\nuncertainty is of a crucial importance in such a scenario. However, previously\nproposed methods, including classical iterative registration methods and deep\nlearning-based methods have one characteristic in common: They lack the\ncapacity to represent the fact that a registration problem may be inherently\nambiguous, meaning that multiple (substantially different) plausible solutions\nexist. To tackle this limitation, we explore the application of invertible\nneural networks (INN) as core component of a registration methodology. In the\nproposed framework, INNs enable going beyond point estimates as network output\nby representing the possible solutions to a registration problem by a\nprobability distribution that encodes different plausible solutions via\nmultiple modes. In a first feasibility study, we test the approach for a 2D 3D\nregistration setting by registering spinal CT volumes to X-ray images. To this\nend, we simulate the X-ray images taken by a C-Arm with multiple orientations\nusing the principle of digitially reconstructed radiographs (DRRs). Due to the\nsymmetry of human spine, there are potentially multiple substantially different\nposes of the C-Arm that can lead to similar projections. The hypothesis of this\nwork is that the proposed approach is able to identify multiple solutions in\nsuch ambiguous registration problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2020 10:28:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-16"}

The explanations can be either obtained by\npost-hoc diagnostics after fitting a relatively complex model or embedded into\nan intrinsically interpretable model. In this paper, we propose the explainable\nrecommendation systems based on a generalized additive model with manifest and\nlatent interactions (GAMMLI). This model architecture is intrinsically\ninterpretable, as it additively consists of the user and item main effects, the\nmanifest user-item interactions based on observed features, and the latent\ninteraction effects from residuals. Unlike conventional collaborative filtering\nmethods, the group effect of users and items are considered in GAMMLI. It is\nbeneficial for enhancing the model interpretability, and can also facilitate\nthe cold-start recommendation problem. A new Python package GAMMLI is developed\nfor efficient model training and visualized interpretation of the results.

This results in a Hudson-Parthasarathy quantum stochastic\ndifferential equation (QSDE) whose drift and dispersion terms are affine and\nlinear functions of the system variables. The quasilinearity of the QSDE leads\nto tractable dynamics of mean values and higher-order multi-point moments of\nthe system variables driven by vacuum input fields. This allows for the\nclosed-form computation of the quasi-characteristic function of the invariant\nquantum state of the system and infinite-horizon asymptotic growth rates for a\nclass of cost functionals. The tractability of the moment dynamics is also used\nfor mean square optimal Luenberger observer design in a measurement-based\nfiltering problem for a quasilinear quantum plant, which leads to a Kalman-like\nquantum filter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2020 11:01:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-16"}

We consider that aircraft velocity vectors may be\nperturbed due to weather effects, such as wind, or measurement errors.

Our goal is to solve the\naircraft conflict resolution problem in the presence of such perturbations and\nguarantee that aircraft are separated for any realization of the uncertain\ndata. We propose an uncertainty model wherein aircraft velocities are\nrepresented as random variables and the uncertainty set is assumed to be\npolyhedral. We consider a robust optimization approach and embed the proposed\nuncertainty model within state-of-the-art mathematical programming formulations\nfor aircraft conflict resolution. We then adopt the approach of Bertsimas and\nSim (2004) to formulate the robust counterpart.

In practice, a map between two shapes is commonly\nrepresented by two meshes with same connectivity and different embedding. The\nstandard approach is to input a meshing of one of the two domains plus a\nfunction that projects its boundary to the other domain, and then solve for the\nposition of the interior vertices. Inspired by basic principles in mesh\ngeneration, in this paper we present the reader a novel point of view on mesh\nparameterization: we consider connectivity as an additional unknown, and assume\nthat our inputs are just two boundaries that enclose the domains we want to\nconnect. We compute the map by simultaneously growing the same mesh inside both\nshapes.This change in perspective allows us to recast the parameterization\nproblem as a mesh generation problem, granting access to a wide set of mature\ntools that are typically not used in this setting. Our practical outcome is a\nprovably robust yet trivial to implement algorithm that maps any planar shape\nwith simple topology to a homotopic domain that is weakly visible from an inner\nconvex kernel.

We calculate the quadrupolar ($l=2$) $f$-mode oscillation ($f_{2f}$) of\nnon-rotating and rotating neutron stars using a nonlinear hydrodynamics code in\nthe conformally-flat approximation and obtain the gravitational-wave frequency\nassociated with the peak amplitude ($f_{\\rm max}$) of binary-neutron stars from\na set of publicly available simulations.

To identify and segment contextual information from complex images\nobtained in these environments, data-driven methods such as Convolutional\nNeural Networks (CNNs) are used. However, these methods require large amounts\nof human labeled data which are slow and time-consuming to obtain. Weakly\nsupervised methods address this limitation by generating pseudo segmentation\nlabels (PSLs). In this paper, we present the novel Weakly Supervised Mask Data\nDistillation (WeSuperMaDD) architecture for autonomously generating PSLs using\nCNNs not specifically trained for the task of context segmentation; i.e., CNNs\ntrained for object classification, image captioning, etc. WeSuperMaDD uniquely\ngenerates PSLs using learned image features from sparse and limited diversity\ndata; common in robot navigation tasks in human-centred environments (malls,\ngrocery stores). Our proposed architecture uses a new mask refinement system\nwhich automatically searches for the PSL with the fewest foreground pixels that\nsatisfies cost constraints. This removes the need for handcrafted heuristic\nrules. Extensive experiments successfully validated the performance of\nWeSuperMaDD in generating PSLs for datasets with text of various scales, fonts,\nand perspectives in multiple indoor/outdoor environments. A comparison with\nNaive, GrabCut, and Pyramid methods found a significant improvement in label\nand segmentation quality. Moreover, a context segmentation CNN trained using\nthe WeSuperMaDD architecture achieved measurable improvements in accuracy\ncompared to one trained with Naive PSLs. Our method also had comparable\nperformance to existing state-of-the-art text detection and segmentation\nmethods on real datasets without requiring segmentation labels for training.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2020 13:24:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-16"}

In this paper, we propose a new hybrid\nquantum-classical framework for supervised quantum learning, which we call\nVariational Shadow Quantum Learning (VSQL). Our method in particular utilizes\nthe classical shadows of quantum data, which fundamentally represent the side\ninformation of quantum data with respect to certain physical observables.\nSpecifically, we first use variational shadow quantum circuits to extract\nclassical features in a convolution way and then utilize a fully-connected\nneural network to complete the classification task. We show that this method\ncould sharply reduce the number of parameters and thus better facilitate\nquantum circuit training. Simultaneously, less noise will be introduced since\nfewer quantum gates are employed in such shadow circuits. Moreover, we show\nthat the Barren Plateau issue, a significant gradient vanishing problem in\nquantum machine learning, could be avoided in VSQL. Finally, we demonstrate the\nefficiency of VSQL in quantum classification via numerical experiments on the\nclassification of quantum states and the recognition of multi-labeled\nhandwritten digits. In particular, our VSQL approach outperforms existing\nvariational quantum classifiers in the test accuracy in the binary case of\nhandwritten digit recognition and notably requires much fewer parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2020 13:51:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-16"}

The required local\noptimality rule (FTR) is proved, in order to minimize the sum or the linear\ncombination of the tasks' flow-time and tardiness costs. This rule has served\nto design a scheduling algorithm, with O(n 3) complexity when it is applied to\nschedule a set of n tasks on one processor.

For an\nidealized mixed plasma which is assumed with a sharp plasma-vacuum interface\nand uniform density distribution, when it is irradiated by a weakly\nrelativistic laser pulse, well-defined signals at harmonics of the plasma\nfrequency in the harmonic spectrum are observed. These characteristic signals\nare attributed to the inverse two-plasmon decay of the counterpropagating\nmonochromatic plasma waves which are excited by the energetic electrons and the\npositron beam accelerated by the laser. Particle-in-cell simulations show the\nsignal at twice the plasma frequency can be observed for a pair density as low\nas $\\sim 10^{-5}$ of the plasma density. In the self-consistent scenario of\npair production by an ultraintense laser striking a solid target,\nparticle-in-cell simulations, which account for quantum electrodynamic effects\n(photon emission and pair production), show that dense (greater than the\nrelativistically-corrected critical density) and hot pair plasmas can be\ncreated. The harmonic spectrum shows weak low order harmonics, indicating a\nhigh laser absorption due to quantum electrodynamic effects. The characteristic\nsignals at harmonics of the plasma frequency are absent, because broadband\nplasma waves are excited due to the high plasma inhomogeneity introduced by the\ninteraction. However, the high frequency harmonics are enhanced due to the\nhigh-frequency modulations from the direct laser coupling with created pair\nplasmas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2020 14:28:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-20"}

Most existing matting methods leverage a user-supplied trimap as an\nauxiliary input to produce good alpha matte. However, obtaining high-quality\ntrimap itself is arduous, thus restricting the application of these methods.\nRecently, some trimap-free methods have emerged, however, the matting quality\nis still far behind the trimap-based methods. The main reason is that, without\nthe trimap guidance in some cases, the target network is ambiguous about which\nis the foreground target. In fact, choosing the foreground is a subjective\nprocedure and depends on the user's intention. To this end, this paper proposes\nan improved deep image matting framework which is trimap-free and only needs\nseveral user click interactions to eliminate the ambiguity. Moreover, we\nintroduce a new uncertainty estimation module that can predict which parts need\npolishing and a following local refinement module.

Deep Ensembles are widely\nconsidered as being one of the best methods for generating uncertainty\nestimates but are very expensive to train and evaluate.

Our\ncentral intuition is that there is a continuous spectrum of ensemble-like\nmodels of which MC-Dropout and Deep Ensembles are extreme examples. The first\nuses an effectively infinite number of highly correlated models while the\nsecond relies on a finite number of independent models.\n  To combine the benefits of both, we introduce Masksembles. Instead of\nrandomly dropping parts of the network as in MC-dropout, Masksemble relies on a\nfixed number of binary masks, which are parameterized in a way that allows to\nchange correlations between individual models. Namely, by controlling the\noverlap between the masks and their density one can choose the optimal\nconfiguration for the task at hand. This leads to a simple and easy to\nimplement method with performance on par with Ensembles at a fraction of the\ncost.

When developing the\nimplicit KIF, a phenomenon is noticed that the kinetic flux vector splitting\n(KFVS) part in boundary layers not only reduces the accuracy, but seriously\nreduces the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) number as well. As a result, in this\npaper, a new weight is proposed about how to combine the KFVS method well with\nthe totally thermalized transport (TTT) method. Besides admitting the using of\nlarger CFL numbers, this new weight brings about more accurate numerical\nresults like pressure, friction coefficient and heat flux when solving shock\nwaves, boundary layers and complex supersonic/hypersonic flows. In order to\nexamine the validity, accuracy and efficiency of the present method, six\nnumerical test cases, covering the whole speed regime, are conducted, including\nthe hypersonic viscous flow past a cylinder, the hypersonic double-cone flow,\nthe hypersonic double-ellipsoid flow, the laminar shock boundary layer\ninteraction, the supersonic flow around a ramp segment and the lid-driven\ncavity flow.

FRBs have thus far been\ndetected between 300 MHz and 8 GHz, but lower-frequency emission has remained\nelusive. A subset of FRBs is known to repeat, and one of those sources, FRB\n20180916B, does so with a 16.3 day activity period. Using simultaneous Apertif\nand LOFAR data, we show that FRB 20180916B emits down to 120 MHz, and that its\nactivity window is both narrower and earlier at higher frequencies. Binary wind\ninteraction models predict a narrower periodic activity window at lower\nfrequencies, which is the opposite of our observations. Our detections\nestablish that low-frequency FRB emission can escape the local medium. For\nbursts of the same fluence, FRB 20180916B is more active below 200 MHz than at\n1.4 GHz. Combining our results with previous upper-limits on the all-sky FRB\nrate at 150 MHz, we find that there are 3-450 FRBs/sky/day above 50 Jy ms at\n90% confidence. We are able to rule out the scenario in which companion winds\ncause FRB periodicity. We also demonstrate that some FRBs live in clean\nenvironments that do not absorb or scatter low-frequency radiation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2020 15:05:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-03"}

Next, allowing both $p$ and $k$ to diverge, we\nderive limiting distributions of the spiked sample eigenvalues using random\nmatrix theory techniques.

Its\nproximity (~150 Mpc), along with detailed studies of the bursts, have revealed\nmany clues about its nature -- including a 16.3-day periodicity in its\nactivity. Here we report on the detection of 18 bursts using LOFAR at 110-188\nMHz, by far the lowest-frequency detections of any FRB to date. Some bursts are\nseen down to the lowest-observed frequency of 110 MHz, suggesting that their\nspectra extend even lower. These observations provide an order-of-magnitude\nstronger constraint on the optical depth due to free-free absorption in the\nsource's local environment. The absence of circular polarization and nearly\nflat polarization angle curves are consistent with burst properties seen at\n300-1700 MHz. Compared with higher frequencies, the larger burst widths\n(~40-160 ms at 150 MHz) and lower linear polarization fractions are likely due\nto scattering. We find ~2-3 rad/m^2 variations in the Faraday rotation measure\nthat may be correlated with the activity cycle of the source. We compare the\nLOFAR burst arrival times to those of 38 previously published and 22 newly\ndetected bursts from the uGMRT (200-450 MHz) and CHIME/FRB (400-800 MHz).\nSimultaneous observations show 5 CHIME/FRB bursts when no emission is detected\nby LOFAR.

For example, processes must be allowed to run asynchronously and\nconcurrently, taking their complex relations into account. This paper\ncontributes the operational semantics of coordination processes, which enforces\nthe coordination constraints at run-time. Coordination processes form complex\nstructures to adequately represent processes and their relations, specifically\nsupporting many-to-many relationships. Based on these complex structures,\nmarkings and process rules allow for the flexible enactment of the\ninterdependent processes while fulfilling all challenges. Coordination\nprocesses represent a sophisticated solution to the complex problem of\ncoordinating interdependent, concurrently running processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2020 18:47:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-16"}

The potential drivers of\nillegal extraction included rebound effect of fishing effort displacement by\nMAs, level of enforcement, distance to surveillance authorities, wave exposure\nand land-based access to the MA, and alternative economic activities in the\nfishing village. The exploitation state of limpets was assessed by the\nproportion of the catch that is below the minimum legal size, with high\nproportions indicating a poor state, and by the relative median size of limpets\nfished within the MAs in comparison with neighbouring OA areas, with larger\nrelative sizes in the MA indicating a good state.

The previous study has shown that uniformity is a key property of\ncontrastive learning. We build relations between the uniformity and the\ntemperature {\\tau} .

Pushing semantically\nconsistent samples apart has no positive effect for acquiring a prior\ninformative to general downstream tasks.

Most studies focus on accomplishing this goal using particles\nthat can localize at the immiscible fluid interface. Therefore, researchers\ntypically seek to optimize the surface activity of particles, as well as their\nability to freely move through a pore space with minimal deposition onto the\nsurrounding solid matrix. Here, we demonstrate that deposition can,\nsurprisingly, promote mobilization of a trapped fluid from a porous medium\nwithout requiring any surface activity. Using confocal microscopy, we directly\nvisualize both colloidal particles and trapped immiscible fluid within a\ntransparent, three-dimensional (3D) porous medium. We find that as non-surface\nactive particles deposit on the solid matrix, increasing amounts of trapped\nfluid become mobilized. We unravel the underlying physics by analyzing the\nextent of deposition, as well as the geometry of trapped fluid droplets, at the\npore scale: deposition increases the viscous stresses on trapped droplets,\novercoming the influence of capillarity that keeps them trapped. Given an\ninitial distribution of trapped fluid, this analysis enables us to predict the\nextent of fluid mobilized through colloidal deposition. Taken together, our\nwork reveals a new way by which colloids can be harnessed to mobilize trapped\nfluid from a porous medium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2020 18:48:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-07"}

However, thermal imaging is strongly material dependent and\ntherefore measured and real temperatures can differ significantly. The emission\ncoefficient resides between 0 and 1 and changes mainly with the electrical\nconductivity of the surface. While non-conductive surfaces (stone, wood, glass\netc.) have a high emissivity of ca. 0.9, metallic surfaces reside around 0.2.\nIf e.g. an object with a temperature of 100$^\\circ$C and E=0.9 gets recorded\nvia thermography, the recording shows a temperature of 90$^\\circ$C. The same\nconditions for a metallic surface on the other hand can result in a measured\ntemperature of only 20$^\\circ$C, so room temperature.\n  This article introduces a novel method how to approximate the electrical\nconductivity of surfaces by the combination of geometric and spectral\ninformation. A new thermographic panorama system called \"ThermoHead\" is used to\ngenerate high-resolution and geometrically calibrated thermal images of the\nsurrounding. For the geometric information, a 3D point cloud from the very same\npoint of view will be recorded with an arbitrary commercial available\nterrestrial 3D laser scanner. Since both data sets have been recorded\nsuccessively from the exact same point of view, the congruent combination\nallows to transfer all geometric informations from the terrestrial 3D laser\nscanner to the thermographic measurement. The radiometric intensity depends on\ne.g. the angle of incidence of the thermographic measurement, which is now\nknown and can be used to narrow down the electrical conductivity of the\nmeasured object.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2020 06:01:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-22"}
