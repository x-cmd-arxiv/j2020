State-of-the-art memory security-reliability co-designs\n(e.g. Synergy) have achieved a good balance on performance, confidentiality,\nintegrity, and reliability. However, these works merely rely on encryption to\nensure data confidentiality, which has been proven unable to prevent\ninformation leakage from memory access patterns. Ring ORAM is an attractive\nconfidential protection protocol to hide memory access patterns to the\nuntrusted storage system. Unfortunately, it does not compatible with the\nsecurity-reliability co-designs. A forced combination would result in more\nsevere performance loss.\n  In this paper, we propose IRO, an Integrity and Reliability enhanced Ring\nORAM design. To reduce the overhead of integrity verification, we propose a low\noverhead integrity tree RIT and use a Minimum Update Subtree Tree (MUST) to\nreduce metadata update overhead. To improve memory reliability, we present\nSecure Replication to provide channel-level error resilience for the ORAM tree\nand use the mirrored channel technique to guarantee the reliability of the\nMUST. Last, we use the error correction pointer (ECP) to repair permanent\nmemory cell fault to further improve device reliability and lifetime. A compact\nmetadata design is used to reduce the storage and consulting overhead of the\nECP.\n  IRO provides strong security and reliability guarantees, while the resulting\nstorage and performance overhead is very small. Our evaluation shows that IRO\nonly increases 7.54% execution time on average over the Baseline under two\nchannels four AES-GCM units setting. With enough AES-GCM units to perform\nconcurrent MAC computing, IRO can reduce 2.14% execution time of the Baseline.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Dec 2020 16:00:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2021 02:27:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-20"}

We present a universal\nrepresentation model, BURT (BERT-inspired Universal Representation from\nlearning meaningful segmenT), to encode different levels of linguistic unit\ninto the same vector space.

Each user\ncan get the fresh files from any relay as long as the relay has stored the\nfresh versions of the requested files. Due to the limited storage capacity and\nupdating capacity of each relay, different cache designs will lead to different\naverage freshness of all updating files at users. In order to keep the average\nfreshness as large as possible in the cache updating system, we formulate an\naverage freshness-optimal cache updating problem (AFOCUP) to obtain an optimal\ncache scheme. However, because of the nonlinearity of the AFOCUP, it is\ndifficult to seek out the optimal cache scheme.

Our experimental results show that WiFresh can improve\ninformation freshness by two orders of magnitude when compared to an equivalent\nstandard WiFi network.

However, there are not many biomechanical studies of muscle\ntransfers, with the available ones often limited to passive movements in\nanatomical planes. Using data from three activities of daily living (ADL) and\nan available computational musculoskeletal model of the shoulder, we analyse\nthe impact of a subscapularis tear and its treatment by a pectoralis major\n(PMA) transfer of the clavicular, sternal, or both segments. The shoulder model\nis validated against experimental data: the model kinematics with motion\ncapture, muscle activity with EMG measurements, and model joint reaction force\nwith in-vivo data from an instrumented prosthesis. Our results indicate that\nsubscapularis tear requires a compensatory activation of the supraspinatus and\nis accompanied by a reduced co-contraction of the infraspinatus, both of which\ncan be partially recovered after PMA transfer. Furthermore, although the PMA\nacts asynchronously to the subscapularis before the transfer, its patterns of\nactivation change significantly after the transfer. Overall, this study\ndemonstrates that muscle transfers have a significant impact on the\nneuromuscular system of the joint during active motion, beyond mere kinematics.\nCapability of a transferred muscle segment to activate similarly to intact\nsubscapularis is found to be dependent on a considered motion. Differences in\nthe activation patterns between intact subscapularis and segments of PMA may\nexplain the difficulty of some patients in adapting their psycho-motor patterns\nduring the rehabilitation period. Thereby, rehabilitation programs could\nbenefit from targeted training on specific motion patterns and biofeedback\nprograms. Finally, the condition of the anterior deltoid should be considered\nto avoid adding limitations to the joint function before a transfer of the\nclavicular part.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Dec 2020 16:32:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-29"}

This paper\nadvances the state of the art by presenting DeepBeam, a framework for beam\nmanagement that does not require pilot sequences from the TX, nor any beam\nsweeping or synchronization from the RX. This is achieved by inferring (i) the\nAngle of Arrival (AoA) of the beam and (ii) the actual beam being used by the\ntransmitter through waveform-level deep learning on ongoing transmissions\nbetween the TX to other receivers. In this way, the RX can associate\nSignal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) levels to beams without explicit coordination with\nthe TX. This is possible because different beam patterns introduce different\nimpairments to the waveform, which can be subsequently learned by a\nconvolutional neural network (CNN). We conduct an extensive experimental data\ncollection campaign where we collect more than 4 TB of mmWave waveforms with\n(i) 4 phased array antennas at 60.48 GHz, (ii) 2 codebooks containing 24\none-dimensional beams and 12 two-dimensional beams; (iii) 3 receiver gains;\n(iv) 3 different AoAs; (v) multiple TX and RX locations. Moreover, we collect\nwaveform data with two custom-designed mmWave software-defined radios with\nfully-digital beamforming architectures at 58 GHz. Results show that DeepBeam\n(i) achieves accuracy of up to 96%, 84% and 77% with a 5-beam, 12-beam and\n24-beam codebook, respectively; (ii) reduces latency by up to 7x with respect\nto the 5G NR initial beam sweep in a default configuration and with a 12-beam\ncodebook. The waveform dataset and the full DeepBeam code repository are\npublicly available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Dec 2020 16:40:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Jun 2021 19:41:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-09"}

The cluster hosts the most powerful radio halo known to date.\nThese new observations, in combination with published uGMRT (300$-$850 MHz) and\nVLA (1$-$6.5 GHz) data, reveal that the halo is more extended than previously\nthought, with a largest linear size of $\\sim2.2 \\rm Mpc$. The halo shows a\nsteep spectrum ($\\alpha_{144\\,\\text{MHz}}^{1.5\\,\\text{GHz}}\\sim-1.4$) and a\nsteepening ($\\alpha_{1.5 \\text{GHz}}^{5.5 \\text{GHz}}\\sim-1.9$) above 1.5 GHz.\nWe find a strong scattering in spectral index maps on scales of 50$-$100 kpc.\nWe suggest that such a strong scattering may be a consequence of the regime\nwhere inverse Compton dominate the energy losses of electrons. The spectral\nindex becomes steeper and shows an increased curvature in the outermost regions\nof the halo. We combined the radio data with \\textit{Chandra} observations to\ninvestigate the connection between the thermal and non-thermal components of\nthe intracluster medium (ICM). Despite a significant substructure in the halo\nemission, the radio brightness correlates strongly with the X-ray brightness at\nall observed frequencies. The radio-versus-X-ray brightness correlation slope\nsteepens at a higher radio frequency (from $b_{144 \\text{MHz}}=0.67\\pm0.05$ to\n$b_{3.0 \\text{GHz}}=0.98\\pm0.09$) and the spectral index shows a significant\nanti correlation with the X-ray brightness. Both pieces of evidence further\nsupport a spectral steepening in the external regions. The compelling evidence\nfor a steep spectral index, the existence of a spectral break above 1.5 GHz,\nand the dependence of radio and X-ray surface brightness correlation on\nfrequency are interpreted in the context of turbulent reacceleration models.\nUnder this scenario, our results allowed us to constrain that the turbulent\nkinetic pressure of the ICM is up to 10%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Dec 2020 17:29:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-24"}

Most remarkably, this contribution is also present when the axion is\ncoupled to the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity, hence allowing\nfor a canonical coupling of a pseudo-scalar to general relativity. For this\ncase we schematically present the influence of the axion coupling on the fixed\npoints in the cosmological dynamics understood as dynamical system. Finally, we\ndisplay possible generalizations and similar extensions in other geometric\nframeworks to model gravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Dec 2020 18:59:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 8 May 2021 21:05:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-11"}

A particularly interesting class of\nalgorithms, the quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNN) could learn\nfeatures of a quantum data set by performing a binary classification task on a\nnontrivial phase of quantum matter. Inspired by this promise, we present a\ngeneralization of QCNN, the branching quantum convolutional neural network, or\nbQCNN, with substantially higher expressibility.

It is, however, known that federated learning is prone to multiple\nsystem challenges including system heterogeneity where clients have different\ncomputation and communication capabilities. Such heterogeneity in clients'\ncomputation speeds has a negative effect on the scalability of federated\nlearning algorithms and causes significant slow-down in their runtime due to\nthe existence of stragglers. In this paper, we propose a novel\nstraggler-resilient federated learning method that incorporates statistical\ncharacteristics of the clients' data to adaptively select the clients in order\nto speed up the learning procedure. The key idea of our algorithm is to start\nthe training procedure with faster nodes and gradually involve the slower nodes\nin the model training once the statistical accuracy of the data corresponding\nto the current participating nodes is reached. The proposed approach reduces\nthe overall runtime required to achieve the statistical accuracy of data of all\nnodes, as the solution for each stage is close to the solution of the\nsubsequent stage with more samples and can be used as a warm-start.

The lack of a\ncontinuous and reliable power supply reduces their average daily output. Since\nthe infrared part is not utilized to produce electricity, conventional\nphotovoltaic cells use only about half of the solar spectrum. Direct radiation\nflux is also necessary for solar Stirling engine to work efficiently. The\nhybrid system can largely overcome these problems. The design combines the\nphotovoltaic and energy storage-integrated Stirling engine or thermal field\nemission technologies in the same concentrating solar power system, providing a\ngreat potential in terms of energy production per unit area. The photovoltaic\ncells can be deposited on the concentrating solar power main mirror to allow\nthe system to collect and convert the diffuse component of the light. The\ndesign allows utilization of existing equipment, particularly a high-grade\nparabolic dish or midgrade Fresnel concentrator for rooftop installation. To\noptimize the use of solar energy, beam splitters thermally decouple the modules\nby splitting the solar spectrum into three spectral ranges and directing\nvisible, ultraviolet and infrared radiation into the photovoltaic cells,\ngate/Cs-filled gap and cavity-type solar receiver, respectively. A\nphoton-enhanced gate electrode creates on the cathode surface an electrostatic\nfield large enough to compensate space charge field and initiates thermal field\nemission process. In the thermal field emission cathodes with nano-structured\nsurfaces, the current density can reach values close to the field emission\nlimit. The design of the electrodes based on nano-structured emission materials\nwere experimentally explored by the co-authors. In these experiments,\nefficiency of heat-to-electricity conversion was investigated and conditions\nfor advanced nano-materials application for harvesting solar energy were found.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Dec 2020 20:14:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-01"}

The usual difficulties are to\nclarify the connection between the demand for certain physical features in the\ntheory and the corresponding mathematical requirement of self-adjointness, and\nto distinguish between self-adjoint and hermitian operator not just at the\nlevel of the mathematical definition but most importantly from the perspective\nthat mere hermiticity, without self-adjointness, does not ensure the desired\nphysical requirements and leaves the theory inconsistent.

Due to low computational complexity of the\nsuperpixel estimation step, our setup can capture hyperspectral images of the\nscenes with little overhead over traditional snapshot hyperspectral cameras,\nbut with significantly higher spatial and spectral resolutions.

We study the spectrum of\nintraband and interband transitions through the joint density of states (JDOS),\nthe optical conductivity tensor, and the Drude spectral weight. The energy\nbands present an indirect gap in each valley. Thus a new possibility opens for\nthe position of the Fermi level (an ``indirect zone''), and for the momentum\nspace for allowed transitions. The JDOS near each gap displays a set of three\nvan Hove singularities which are in contrast to the case of gapped graphene (an\nabsorption edge only) or 8-$Pmmn$ borophene (two interband critical points due\nto the tilt). For the Fermi level lying in the gap, the JDOS shows the usual\nlinear dependence on frequency, while when above an indirect zone it looks\nsimilar to the borophene case. These spectral characteristics determine the\nprominent structure of the optical conductivity. The longitudinal conductivity\nillustrates the strong anisotropy of the optical response. Similarly, the Drude\nweight is anisotropic and shows regions of nonlinear dependence on the Fermi\nlevel. The breaking of valley symmetry leads to a finite Hall response and\nassociated optical properties. The anomalous and valley Hall conductivities\npresent graphene-like behavior with characteristic modifications due to the\nindirect zones. Almost perfect circular dichroism can be achieved by tuning the\nexciting frequency with an appropriate Fermi level position. We also calculate\nthe spectra of optical opacity and polarization rotation, which can reach\nmagnitudes of tenths of radians in some cases. The spectral features of the\ncalculated response properties are signatures of the simultaneous presence of\ntilt and mass and suggest optical ways to determine the formation of different\ngaps in such class of Dirac systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Dec 2020 22:23:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-21"}

Of this, corporate legal departments pay\nlaw firms $80 billion for their services. Every month, legal departments\nreceive and process invoices from these law firms and legal service providers.\nLegal invoice review is and has been a pain point for corporate legal\ndepartment leaders.

The goal is to minimize both the number of centers\nand the $k$-means cost. Previous works in this setting assume that the input's\norder is random, or that the input's aspect ratio is bounded.

A fusion chain\nsustained by elastic collisions between the alpha particles and fuel ions, this\nway scattered to suprathermal energies, has been proposed as a possible route\nto overcome this limitation.

Hazard pointer (HP)\nbased algorithms bound unreclaimed memory at all times, but tend to be slower\nthan other approaches. Epoch based reclamation (EBR) algorithms are faster, but\ndo not bound memory reclamation. Other algorithms follow hybrid approaches,\nrequiring special compiler or hardware support, changes to record layouts,\nand/or extensive code changes. Not all SMR algorithms can be used to reclaim\nmemory for all data structures.\n  We propose a new neutralization based reclamation (NBR) algorithm that is\nfaster than the best known EBR algorithms and achieves bounded unreclaimed\nmemory. It is non-blocking when used with a non-blocking operating system (OS)\nkernel, and only requires atomic read, write and CAS. NBR is straightforward to\nuse with many different data structures, and in most cases, require similar\nreasoning and programmer effort to two-phased locking. NBR is implemented using\nOS signals and a lightweight handshaking mechanism between participating\nthreads to determine when it is safe to reclaim a record. Experiments on a\nlock-based binary search tree and a lazy linked list show that NBR\nsignificantly outperforms many state of the art reclamation algorithms. In the\ntree NBR is faster than next best algorithm, DEBRA by upto 38% and HP by upto\n17%.

The maximal order of approximation in the decomposition can\nbe specified or left unlimited. If a first order approximation is chosen, the\nresult is an additive model. In the other extreme case, if the order of\napproximation is not limited, the resulting model places no restrictions on the\nform of the regression function.

A rapidly growing field\nof CAN security research has emerged that seeks to detect intrusions on CANs.\nProducing vehicular CAN data with a variety of intrusions is out of reach for\nmost researchers as it requires expensive assets and expertise. To assist\nresearchers, we present the first comprehensive guide to the existing open CAN\nintrusion datasets, including a quality analysis of each dataset and an\nenumeration of each's benefits, drawbacks, and suggested use case. Current\npublic CAN IDS datasets are limited to real fabrication (simple message\ninjection) attacks and simulated attacks often in synthetic data, which lack\nfidelity. In general, the physical effects of attacks on the vehicle are not\nverified in the available datasets. Only one dataset provides signal-translated\ndata but not a corresponding raw binary version. Overall, the available data\npigeon-holes CAN IDS works into testing on limited, often inappropriate data\n(usually with attacks that are too easily detectable to truly test the method),\nand this lack data has stymied comparability and reproducibility of results. As\nour primary contribution, we present the ROAD (Real ORNL Automotive\nDynamometer) CAN Intrusion Dataset, consisting of over 3.5 hours of one\nvehicle's CAN data. ROAD contains ambient data recorded during a diverse set of\nactivities, and attacks of increasing stealth with multiple variants and\ninstances of real fuzzing, fabrication, and unique advanced attacks, as well as\nsimulated masquerade attacks. To facilitate benchmarking CAN IDS methods that\nrequire signal-translated inputs, we also provide the signal time series format\nfor many of the CAN captures. Our contributions aim to facilitate appropriate\nbenchmarking and needed comparability in the CAN IDS field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Dec 2020 04:18:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 8 Jan 2022 20:46:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-11"}

In this work, we take a step toward bridging this gap by\nintroducing the Emergent Symbol Binding Network (ESBN), a recurrent network\naugmented with an external memory that enables a form of variable-binding and\nindirection. This binding mechanism allows symbol-like representations to\nemerge through the learning process without the need to explicitly incorporate\nsymbol-processing machinery, enabling the ESBN to learn rules in a manner that\nis abstracted away from the particular entities to which those rules apply.\nAcross a series of tasks, we show that this architecture displays nearly\nperfect generalization of learned rules to novel entities given only a limited\nnumber of training examples, and outperforms a number of other competitive\nneural network architectures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Dec 2020 04:28:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 2021 01:13:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-11"}

In order to estimate cosmic curvature from cosmological\nprobes like standard candles, one has to be able to measure the luminosity\ndistance $D_L(z)$, it's derivative with respect to redshift $D'_L(z)$ and\nindependently know the expansion rate $H(z)$ at the same redshift.

Since transmission is robust\nin topological insulators, the essential field variable is the phase of the\ntransmitted field, or, equivalently, its spectral derivative, which is the\ntransmission time. Except near resonances with bulk localized modes that couple\nthe upper and lower edges of a topological insulator, the transmission time in\na topological insulator is proportional to the density of states and to the\nenergy excited within the sample. The average transmission time is enhanced in\ndisordered TIs near the band edge and slightly suppressed in the center of the\nband gap. The variance of the transmission time at the band edge for a random\nensemble with moderate disorder is dominated by fluctuations at resonances with\nlocalized states, and initially scales quadratically. When modes are absent,\nsuch as in the center of the band gap, the transmission time self-averages and\nits variance scales linearly. This leads to significant sample-to-sample\nfluctuations in the transmission time. However, because the transmission time\nis the sum of contributions from the continuum edge mode, which stretches\nacross the band gap, and far-off-resonance modes near the band edge, there are\nno sharp features in the spectrum of transmission time in the center of the\nband gap. As a result, ultrashort, broadband pulses are faithfully transmitted\nin the center of the band gap of topological insulators with moderate disorder\nand bent paths. This allows for robust signal propagation in complex\ntopological metawaveguides for applications in high-speed optoelectronics and\ntelecommunications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Dec 2020 04:59:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-12"}

Many trajectory\nplanning algorithms use a reference curve based Frenet frame with time to\nreduce the planning dimension. However, there is a common implicit assumption\nin classic trajectory planning approaches, which is that the generated\ntrajectory should follow the reference curve continuously. This assumption is\nnot always true in real applications and it might cause some undesired issues\nin planning. One issue is that the projection of the planned trajectory onto\nthe reference curve maybe discontinuous. Then, some segments on the reference\ncurve are not the image of any part of the planned path. Another issue is that\nthe planned path might self-intersect when following a simple reference curve\ncontinuously.

Compared with the rapid development of deep\nlearning for two-dimensional (2D) image tasks, deep learning-based instance\nsegmentation of 3D point cloud still has a lot of room for development. In\nparticular, distinguishing a large number of occluded objects of the same class\nis a highly challenging problem, which is seen in a robotic bin-picking. In a\nusual bin-picking scene, many identical objects are stacked together and the\nmodel of the objects is known. Thus, the semantic information can be ignored;\ninstead, the focus in the bin-picking is put on the segmentation of instances.\nBased on this task requirement, we propose a Fast Point Cloud Clustering (FPCC)\nfor instance segmentation of bin-picking scene. FPCC includes a network named\nFPCC-Net and a fast clustering algorithm. FPCC-net has two subnets, one for\ninferring the geometric centers for clustering and the other for describing\nfeatures of each point. FPCC-Net extracts features of each point and infers\ngeometric center points of each instance simultaneously. After that, the\nproposed clustering algorithm clusters the remaining points to the closest\ngeometric center in feature embedding space. Experiments show that FPCC also\nsurpasses the existing works in bin-picking scenes and is more computationally\nefficient.

In many important settings,\n$f$ uniquely determines $P$ (up to a constant) and therefore a common approach\nis to focus on the design of $f$ and neglect the role of the payment function.\nFadel and Segal [JET, 2009] question this approach by taking the lenses of\ncommunication complexity: can it be that the communication complexity of an\nincentive compatible mechanism that implements $f$ (that is, computes both the\noutput and the payments) is much larger than the communication complexity of\ncomputing the output? I.e., can it be that $cc_{IC}(f)>>cc(f)$? Fadel and Segal\nshow that for every $f$, $cc_{IC}(f)\\leq exp(cc(f))$. They also show that fully\ncomputing the incentive compatible mechanism is strictly harder than computing\nonly the output: there exists a social choice function $f$ such that\n$cc_{IC}(f)=cc(f)+1$. In a follow-up work, Babaioff, Blumrosen, Naor, and\nSchapira [EC'08] provide a social choice function $f$ such that\n$cc_{IC}(f)=\\Theta(n\\cdot cc(f))$, where $n$ is the number of players. The\nquestion of whether the exponential upper bound of Fadel and Segal is tight\nremained wide open. In this paper we solve this question by explicitly\nproviding an $f$ such that $cc_{IC}(f)= exp(cc(f))$. In fact, we establish this\nvia two very different proofs. In contrast, we show that if the players are\nrisk-neutral and we can compromise on a randomized truthful-in-expectation\nimplementation (and not on deterministic ex-post implementation) gives that\n$cc_{TIE}(f)=poly(n,cc(f))$ for every function $f$, as long as the domain of\n$f$ is single parameter or a convex multi-parameter domain. We also provide\nefficient algorithms for deterministic computation of payments in several\nimportant domains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Dec 2020 06:38:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-01"}

It is a challenging task which requires learning\nfrom new data as well as preserving the knowledge extracted from the previously\naccessed data. This challenge is known as the stability-plasticity dilemma. We\npropose AILearn, a generic model for incremental learning which overcomes the\nstability-plasticity dilemma by carefully integrating the ensemble of base\nclassifiers trained on new data with the current ensemble without retraining\nthe model from scratch using entire data. We demonstrate the efficacy of the\nproposed AILearn model on spoof fingerprint detection application. One of the\nsignificant challenges associated with spoof fingerprint detection is the\nperformance drop on spoofs generated using new fabrication materials. AILearn\nis an adaptive incremental learning model which adapts to the features of the\n``live'' and ``spoof'' fingerprint images and efficiently recognizes the new\nspoof fingerprints as well as the known spoof fingerprints when the new data is\navailable. To the best of our knowledge, AILearn is the first attempt in\nincremental learning algorithms that adapts to the properties of data for\ngenerating a diverse ensemble of base classifiers. From the experiments\nconducted on standard high-dimensional datasets LivDet 2011, LivDet 2013 and\nLivDet 2015, we show that the performance gain on new fake materials is\nsignificantly high.

Notably,\nwe propose a quadratic price model for the ESO charging its consumers by their\nrequested RUS and formulate their interactions as a Stackelberg game, which\nadmits an equilibrium. We prove the CES model outperforms individual ES (IES)\nmodel in social welfare. Besides, we study the performance of the CES model\ncompared with the IES model and an existing ES sharing model (referring to VES\nmodel) via case studies.

Despite the remarkable\nachievements, the repetition problem has been observed in nearly all text\ngeneration models undermining the generation performance extensively. To solve\nthe repetition problem, many methods have been proposed, but there is no\nexisting theoretical analysis to show why this problem happens and how it is\nresolved. In this paper, we propose a new framework for theoretical analysis\nfor the repetition problem. We first define the Average Repetition Probability\n(ARP) to characterize the repetition problem quantitatively. Then, we conduct\nan extensive analysis of the Markov generation model and derive several upper\nbounds of the average repetition probability with intuitive understanding. We\nshow that most of the existing methods are essentially minimizing the upper\nbounds explicitly or implicitly. Grounded on our theory, we show that the\nrepetition problem is, unfortunately, caused by the traits of our language\nitself. One major reason is attributed to the fact that there exist too many\nwords predicting the same word as the subsequent word with high probability.\nConsequently, it is easy to go back to that word and form repetitions and we\ndub it as the high inflow problem. Furthermore, we derive a concentration bound\nof the average repetition probability for a general generation model. Finally,\nbased on the theoretical upper bounds, we propose a novel rebalanced encoding\napproach to alleviate the high inflow problem. The experimental results show\nthat our theoretical framework is applicable in general generation models and\nour proposed rebalanced encoding approach alleviates the repetition problem\nsignificantly.

It is evaluated against the PID\n(proportional-integral-derivative) strategy, using a unified framework. RL is\nan autonomous learning mechanism that learns by interacting with its\nenvironment. It is gaining increasing attention in the world of control systems\nas a means of building optimal-controllers for challenging dynamic and\nnonlinear processes. Published RL research often uses open-source tools (Python\nand OpenAI Gym environments). We use MATLAB's recently launched (R2019a)\nReinforcement Learning Toolbox to develop the valve controller; trained using\nthe DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy-Gradient) algorithm and Simulink to\nsimulate the nonlinear valve and create the experimental test-bench for\nevaluation. Simulink allows industrial engineers to quickly adapt and\nexperiment with other systems of their choice. Results indicate that the RL\ncontroller is extremely good at tracking the signal with speed and produces a\nlower error with respect to the reference signal. The PID, however, is better\nat disturbance rejection and hence provides a longer life for the valves.\nSuccessful machine learning involves tuning many hyperparameters requiring\nsignificant investment of time and efforts. We introduce \"Graded Learning\" as a\nsimplified, application oriented adaptation of the more formal and algorithmic\n\"Curriculum for Reinforcement Learning\".

In order to test these\ntheories, we need accurate models of observable binary populations. The Kepler\nEclipsing Binary Catalog (KEBC), with its estimated $>$90% completeness,\nprovides an observational anchor on binary population models. In this work we\npresent the results of a new forward-model of the binary star population in the\nKepler field. The forward-model takes a single star population from a model of\nthe galaxy and pairs the stars into binaries by applying the constraints on the\npopulation from the results of observational binary population surveys such as\narXiv:1007.0414 and arXiv:1303.3028. A synthetic binary population is\nconstructed from the initial distributions of orbital parameters. We identify\nthe eclipsing binary sample from the generated binary star population and\ncompare this with the observed sample of eclipsing binaries contained in the\nKEBC. Finally, we update the distributions of the synthetic population and\nrepeat the process until the synthetic eclipsing binary sample agrees with the\nKEBC. The end result of this process is a model of the underlying binary star\npopulation that has been fit to observations. We find that for fixed flat mass\nratio and eccentricity input distributions, the binary period distribution is\nlogarithmically flat above $\\sim$3.2d. With additional constraints on\ndistributions from observations, we can further adjust the synthetic binary\npopulation by relaxing other input constraints, such as mass ratio and\neccentricity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Dec 2020 09:15:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-24"}

The laser\nintensity (I, units W.cm$^{-2}$) is tuned between 1 and 480 MW.cm$^{-2}$, and\nthe depletion of the density of the Kr 5p'[3/2]$_2$ fluorescing state through\nphotoionization (PIN) and amplified stimulated emission (ASE) is investigated.\nThis is done by combining TALIF experiments with a simple 0D numerical model.\nWe demonstrate that for a gas pressure of 3 mbar and 15 < $\\le$ 480\nMW.cm$^{-2}$, a saturated fluorescence signal is obtained, which is largely\nattributed to PIN, ASE being negligible. Also, a broadening of the two-photon\nabsorption line (i.e. 4p$^6$ $^1$S0$\\to$5p'[3/2]$_2$) is recorded due to the\nproduction of charged species through PIN, inducing a Stark effect. For\nI$\\le$15 MW.cm$^{-2}$, though, PIN is significantly limited, the absorption\nline is noticeably narrowed, and the quadratic dependence of the TALIF signal\nintensity versus the laser energy is obtained. Thus, in this case, the\ninvestigated Kr TALIF scheme, using the 5p'[3/2]$_2\\to$5s[3/2]$_1$ fluorescence\nchannel, can be used for calibration purposes in ps-TALIF experiments. These\nresults are of interest for fundamental research since most ps-TALIF studies\nperformed in Kr do not investigate in detail the role of PIN and ASE on the\ndepletion of the Kr 5p'[3/2]$_2$ state density. Moreover, this work contributes\nto the development of ps-TALIF for determining absolute densities and quenching\ncoefficients of H and N atoms in plasmas. This is useful in numerous\nplasma-based applications (e.g. thin film synthesis, biomedical treatments,\nplasma-assisted combustion, ...), for which the knowledge of the\ndensity/kinetics of reactive atoms is essential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Dec 2020 09:46:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-14"}

We also prove a converse of the main result showing\nthat the condition $I$ being generated by a $J$-filter regular sequence is the\nbest possible for its validity. The main result can be also extended to\nperturbations with respect to filtrations of ideals. As a consequence, if $R$\nis a power series ring, $f_1,...,f_r$ is a filter regular sequence, and $f_i'$\nis the $n$-jet of $f_i$ for $n \\gg 0$, then $I$ and $I'$ have the same initial\nideal with respect to any Noetherian monomial order. A special case of this\nconsequence was a conjecture of Adamus and Seyedinejad on approximations of\nanalytic complete intersection singularities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Dec 2020 12:02:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 16 Jan 2021 04:31:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 22 Jan 2023 17:41:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-24"}

Representation learning on\nheterogeneous graphs aims to obtain low-dimensional node representations that\ncould preserve both node attributes and relation information. However, most of\nthe existing graph convolution approaches were designed for homogeneous graphs,\nand therefore cannot handle heterogeneous graphs. Some recent methods designed\nfor heterogeneous graphs are also faced with several issues, including the\ninsufficient utilization of heterogeneous properties, structural information\nloss, and lack of interpretability. In this paper, we propose HGConv, a novel\nHeterogeneous Graph Convolution approach, to learn comprehensive node\nrepresentations on heterogeneous graphs with a hybrid micro/macro level\nconvolutional operation. Different from existing methods, HGConv could perform\nconvolutions on the intrinsic structure of heterogeneous graphs directly at\nboth micro and macro levels: A micro-level convolution to learn the importance\nof nodes within the same relation, and a macro-level convolution to distinguish\nthe subtle difference across different relations. The hybrid strategy enables\nHGConv to fully leverage heterogeneous information with proper\ninterpretability. Moreover, a weighted residual connection is designed to\naggregate both inherent attributes and neighbor information of the focal node\nadaptively. Extensive experiments on various tasks demonstrate not only the\nsuperiority of HGConv over existing methods, but also the intuitive\ninterpretability of our approach for graph analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Dec 2020 12:12:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-01"}

Once a deployer trusts the\nhypocritical performance and applies the \"well-performed\" model in real-world\napplications, unexpected failures may happen even in benign environments.

However, existing methods still fall short in predicting rare\nposes. The reason is that most of the current models perform regression based\non a single human prototype, which is similar to common poses while far from\nthe rare poses. In this work, we 1) identify and analyze this learning obstacle\nand 2) propose a prototype memory-augmented network, PM-Net, that effectively\nimproves performances of predicting rare poses. The core of our framework is a\nmemory module that learns and stores a set of 3D human prototypes capturing\nlocal distributions for either common poses or rare poses. With this\nformulation, the regression starts from a better initialization, which is\nrelatively easier to converge. Extensive experiments on several widely employed\ndatasets demonstrate the proposed framework's effectiveness compared to other\nstate-of-the-art methods.

Recently proposed deep\nlearning based methods largely improve the estimation accuracy but their\nperformance can be greatly affected by data and often difficult for system\ndeployment.\n  In this paper, we revitalize the Bayesian networks (BN) for CardEst by\nincorporating the techniques of probabilistic programming languages.

Apart from increased performance,\nlarge scale systems face two challenges that hinder further growth: energy\nefficiency and resiliency. At the same time, applications seeking increased\nperformance rely on advanced parallelism for exploiting system resources, which\nleads to increased pressure on system interconnects. At large system scales,\nincreased communication locality can be beneficial both in terms of application\nperformance and energy consumption. Towards this direction, several studies\nfocus on deriving a mapping of an application's processes to system nodes in a\nway that communication cost is reduced. A common approach is to express both\nthe application's communication patterns and the system architecture as graphs\nand then solve the corresponding mapping problem. Apart from communication\ncost, the completion time of a job can also be affected by node failures. Node\nfailures may result in job abortions, requiring job restarts. In this paper, we\naddress the problem of assigning processes to system resources with the goal of\nreducing communication cost while also taking into account node failures. The\nproposed approach is integrated into the Slurm resource manager. Evaluation\nresults show that, in scenarios where few nodes have a low outage probability,\nthe proposed process placement approach achieves a notable decrease in the\ncompletion time of batches of MPI jobs.

In this paper, we present a deep learning framework for\nfeature-level fusion that generates a secure multimodal template from each\nuser's face and iris biometrics. We integrate a deep hashing (binarization)\ntechnique into the fusion architecture to generate a robust binary multimodal\nshared latent representation. Further, we employ a hybrid secure architecture\nby combining cancelable biometrics with secure sketch techniques and integrate\nit with a deep hashing framework, which makes it computationally prohibitive to\nforge a combination of multiple biometrics that pass the authentication.

However,\nclinical dose evaluations follow the water-based TG-43 approach with its\nconsiderable approximations. Towards clinical adoption of advanced TG-186\nmodel-based dose evaluations, this study presents a comprehensive investigation\nfor PBSI considering both target and normal tissue doses. METHODS: Dose\ncalculations are performed with the free open-source Monte Carlo (MC) code,\negs_brachy, using 2 types of virtual patient models: TG43sim (simulated TG-43\nconditions: all water with no interseed attenuation) and MCref (heterogeneous\ntissue modelling from patient CT, interseed attenuation, seeds at implant\nangle) for 35 patients. Sensitivity of dose metrics to seed orientation and the\nthreshold for glandular/adipose tissue segmentation are assessed. RESULTS: In\nthe target volume, D90 is 14.1% lower with MCref than with TG43sim, on average.\nConversely, normal tissue doses are generally higher with MCref than with\nTG43sim, e.g., by 22% for skin D1cm2, 82% for ribs Dmax, and 71% for heart\nD1cm3. Discrepancies between MCref and TG43sim doses vary over the patient\ncohort, as well as with the tissue and metric considered. Doses are sensitive\nto the glandular/adipose tissue segmentation threshold with differences of a\nfew percent in target D90. Skin doses are sensitive to seed orientation.\nCONCLUSIONS: TG-43 dose evaluations generally underestimate doses to critical\nnormal organs/tissues while overestimating target doses. There is considerable\nvariation in MCref and TG43sim on a patient-by-patient basis, suggesting that\nclinical adoption of patient-specific MC dose calculations is motivated. The\nMCref framework presented herein provides a consistent modelling approach for\nclinical implementation of advanced TG-186 dose calculations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Dec 2020 14:24:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-27"}

However, it is still\nnot entirely clear why and when EncoderFusion should work. In this paper, our\nmain contribution is to take a step further in understanding EncoderFusion.\nMany of previous studies believe that the success of EncoderFusion comes from\nexploiting surface and syntactic information embedded in lower encoder layers.\nUnlike them, we find that the encoder embedding layer is more important than\nother intermediate encoder layers. In addition, the uppermost decoder layer\nconsistently pays more attention to the encoder embedding layer across NLP\ntasks. Based on this observation, we propose a simple fusion method,\nSurfaceFusion, by fusing only the encoder embedding layer for the softmax\nlayer. Experimental results show that SurfaceFusion outperforms EncoderFusion\non several NLP benchmarks, including machine translation, text summarization,\nand grammatical error correction. It obtains the state-of-the-art performance\non WMT16 Romanian-English and WMT14 English-French translation tasks.

Methods: In this institutional\nreview board approved study, a stroke database of 962 cases (mean age 65+/-17\nyears, 255 males, 449 scans with DW positive stroke lesions) and a normal\ndatabase of 2,027 patients (mean age 38+/-24 years,1088 females) were obtained.\nBrain volumes with synthetic DW stroke lesions were produced by warping the\nrelative signal increase of real strokes to normal brain volumes. A generic 3D\nU-Net was trained on four different databases to generate four different\nmodels: (a) 375 neuroradiologist-labeled clinical DW positive stroke\ncases(CDB);(b) 2,000 synthetic cases(S2DB);(c) CDB+2,000 synthetic\ncases(CS2DB); or (d) CDB+40,000 synthetic cases(CS40DB).

The two model\ncomponents are strongly coupled. On one hand, the flow affects the\nconcentration of the solute; on the other hand, the surface tension is a\nfunction of the solute, which impacts the capillary pressure and, consequently,\nthe flow.

It can be regarded as a personalized and\ninteractive emotion recognition task, which is supposed to consider not only\nthe semantic information of text but also the influences from speakers. The\ncurrent method models speakers' interactions by building a relation between\nevery two speakers. However, this fine-grained but complicated modeling is\ncomputationally expensive, hard to extend, and can only consider local context.\nTo address this problem, we simplify the complicated modeling to a binary\nversion: Intra-Speaker and Inter-Speaker dependencies, without identifying\nevery unique speaker for the targeted speaker. To better achieve the simplified\ninteraction modeling of speakers in Transformer, which shows excellent ability\nto settle long-distance dependency, we design three types of masks and\nrespectively utilize them in three independent Transformer blocks. The designed\nmasks respectively model the conventional context modeling, Intra-Speaker\ndependency, and Inter-Speaker dependency. Furthermore, different speaker-aware\ninformation extracted by Transformer blocks diversely contributes to the\nprediction, and therefore we utilize the attention mechanism to automatically\nweight them. Experiments on two ERC datasets indicate that our model is\nefficacious to achieve better performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Dec 2020 14:47:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-01"}

The \\kovats retention indices of a large number of molecules have been\ndetermined experimentally. The \"NIST 20: GC Method\\slash Retention Index\nLibrary\" database has collected and, more importantly, curated retention\nindices of a subset of these compounds resulting in a highly valued reference\ndatabase. The experimental data in the library form an ideal data set for\ntraining machine learning models for the prediction of retention indices of\nunknown compounds. In this article, we describe the training of a graph neural\nnetwork model to predict the \\kovats retention index for compounds in the NIST\nlibrary and compare this approach with previous work \\cite{2019Matyushin}. We\npredict the \\kovats retention index with a mean unsigned error of 28 index\nunits as compared to 44, the putative best result using a convolutional neural\nnetwork \\cite{2019Matyushin}. The NIST library also incorporates an estimation\nscheme based on a group contribution approach that achieves a mean unsigned\nerror of 114 compared to the experimental data. Our method uses the same input\ndata source as the group contribution approach, making its application\nstraightforward and convenient to apply to existing libraries.

The population version of any of these measures captures\nthe strength of conditional dependence and it is 0 if and only if $Y$ and $Z$\nare conditionally independent given $X$, and 1 if and only if $Y$ is a\nmeasurable function of $Z$ and $X$. Thus, our measure -- which we call kernel\npartial correlation (KPC) coefficient -- can be thought of as a nonparametric\ngeneralization of the partial correlation coefficient that possesses the above\nproperties when $(X,Y,Z)$ is jointly normal. We describe two consistent methods\nof estimating KPC. Our first method utilizes the general framework of geometric\ngraphs, including $K$-nearest neighbor graphs and minimum spanning trees. A\nsub-class of these estimators can be computed in near linear time and converges\nat a rate that automatically adapts to the intrinsic dimension(s) of the\nunderlying distribution(s). Our second strategy involves direct estimation of\nconditional mean embeddings using cross-covariance operators in the reproducing\nkernel Hilbert spaces. Using these empirical measures we develop forward\nstepwise (high-dimensional) nonlinear variable selection algorithms. We show\nthat our algorithm, using the graph-based estimator, yields a provably\nconsistent model-free variable selection procedure, even in the\nhigh-dimensional regime when the number of covariates grows exponentially with\nthe sample size, under suitable sparsity assumptions.

Currently, there is no systematic way for deriving or\nextracting such information from reference simulations, such as discrete\ndislocation dynamics or molecular dynamics. Here, a novel data-mining approach\nis proposed through which energy density data from systems of discrete\ndislocations can be extracted. Our approach relies on a systematic and\ncontrolled coarse-graining process and thereby is consistent with the length\nscale of interest. For data-mining, a range of different dislocation\nmicrostructures that were generated from 2D and 3D discrete dislocation\ndynamics simulations, are used. The analyses of the data sets result in energy\ndensity formulations as function of various dislocation density fields. The\nproposed approach solves the long-standing problem of voxel-size dependent\nenergy calculation during coarse graining of dislocation microstructures.

The external energy input impresses a force per\nunit charge within the voltage source, to form an active physical dipole in the\nstatic case, or an active Hertzian dipole in the time dependent case. This\nsystem is the dual of an electromagnet or permanent magnet excited by a\ncirculating electrical current or fictitious bound current respectively, which\nsupplies a magnetomotive force described by a magnetic vector potential with a\nmagnetic geometric phase proportional to the enclosed magnetic flux. In\ncontrast, the active electric dipole may be described macroscopically by a\ncirculating fictitious magnetic current boundary source described by an\nelectric vector potential with an electric geometric phase proportional to the\nenclosed electric flux density. This macroscopic description of an active\ndipole is an average description of some underlying microscopic description\nexhibiting emergent nonconservative behaviour not found in classical\nconservative laws of electrodynamics. We show that the electromotive force\nproduced by an active dipole must have both electric scalar and vector\npotential components to account for the magnitude of the voltage it produces.\nFollowing this we analyse an active cylindrical dipole in terms of scalar and\nvector potential and confirm that the electromotive force produced, and hence\npotential difference across the terminals is a combination of vector and scalar\npotential difference depending on aspect ratio of the dipole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Dec 2020 01:23:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Jan 2021 23:24:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 26 Mar 2021 08:22:03 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 2 Mar 2022 22:17:19 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 14 Sep 2022 04:24:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-06"}

Under the condition of (nearly) commensurable natural\nfrequencies, the nonlinear character of friction can cause so-called nonlinear\nmodal interactions. If harmonic forcing near the natural frequency of a\nspecific mode is applied, for instance, another mode may be excited due to\nnonlinear energy transfer and thus contribute considerably to the vibration\nresponse. We investigate how this phenomenon affects the performance of\nfriction damping. To this end, we study the steady-state, periodic forced\nvibrations of a system of two beams connected via a local mechanical friction\njoint. The system can be tuned to continuously adjust the ratio between the\nfirst two natural frequencies in the range around the $1:3$ internal resonance,\nin order to trigger or suppress the emergence of modal interactions. Due to the\nre-distribution of the vibration energy, the vibration level can in fact be\nreduced in certain situations. However, in other situations, the multi-harmonic\ncharacter of the vibration has detrimental effects on the effective damping\nprovided by the friction joint. The resulting response level can be\nsignificantly larger than in the absence of modal interactions. Moreover, it is\nshown that the vibration behavior is highly sensitive in the neighborhood of\ninternal resonances. It is thus concluded that the condition of internal\nresonance should be avoided in the design of friction-damped systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Dec 2020 19:37:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-12"}

Recent experimental observations\nsuggest that the system passively (self-)adapts the axial location of the\nslider to achieve and maintain a condition of self-resonance, which could be\nuseful in applications such as energy harvesting. The purpose of this work is\nto provide a theoretical explanation of this phenomenon based on an appropriate\nmodel. A key feature of the proposed model is a small clearance between the\nslider and the beam. This clearance gives rise to backlash and frictional\ncontact interactions, both of which are found to be essential for the\nself-adaptive behavior. Contact is modeled in terms of the Coulomb and\nSignorini laws, together with the Newton impact law. The set-valued character\nof the contact laws is accounted for in a measure differential inclusion\nformulation. Numerical integration is carried out using Moreau's time-stepping\nscheme. The proposed model reproduces qualitatively most experimental\nobservations. However, although the system showed a distinct self-adaptive\ncharacter, the behavior was found to be non-resonant for the considered set of\nparameters. Beside estimating the relationship between resonance frequency and\nslider location, the model permits predicting the operating limits with regard\nto excitation level and frequency. Finally, some specific dynamical phenomena\nsuch as hysteresis effects and transient resonance captures underline the rich\ndynamical behavior of the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Dec 2020 20:15:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-12"}
