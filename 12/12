Data gathered by its onboard magnetometer reveal a dipole-dominated\nsurface magnetic field accompanied by strong localised magnetic flux patches.\nThe gravity measurements indicate that the fierce surface zonal jets extend\nseveral thousands of kilometers below the cloud level before rapidly decaying\nbelow $0.94-0.96\\,R_J$, $R_J$ being the mean Jovian radius at the one bar\nlevel. Several internal models suggest an intricate internal structure with a\nthin intermediate region in which helium would segregate from hydrogen, forming\na compositionally-stratified layer. Here, we develop the first global Jovian\ndynamo which incorporates an intermediate stably-stratified layer between\n$0.82\\,R_J$ and $0.86\\,R_J$. Analysing the energy balance reveals that the\nmagnetic energy is almost one order of magnitude larger than kinetic energy in\nthe metallic region, while most of the kinetic energy is pumped into zonal\nmotions in the molecular envelope. Those result from the different underlying\nforce hierarchy with a triple balance between Lorentz, Archimedean and\nageostrophic Coriolis forces in the metallic core and inertia, buoyancy and\nageostrophic Coriolis forces controlling the external layers. The simulation\npresented here is the first to demonstrate that multiple zonal jets and\ndipole-dominated dynamo action can be consolidated in a global simulation. The\ninclusion of an stable layer is a necessary ingredient that allows zonal jets\nto develop in the outer envelope without contributing to the dynamo action in\nthe deeper metallic region. Stable stratification however also smooths out the\nsmall-scale features of the magnetic field by skin effect. These constraints\nsuggest that possible stable layers in Jupiter should be located much closer to\nthe surface ($0.9-0.95\\,R_J$).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Dec 2020 16:00:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Apr 2021 08:10:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 20 May 2021 12:00:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-21"}

Our main contribution is the introduction of a novel\nloss formulation, which jointly enhances the discriminability of latent\nembeddings and robustness of the output temporal class activations with respect\nto foreground-background noise caused by weak supervision. The proposed\nformulation comprises a discriminative and a denoising loss term for enhancing\ntemporal action localization. The discriminative term incorporates a\nclassification loss and utilizes a top-down attention mechanism to enhance the\nseparability of latent foreground-background embeddings. The denoising loss\nterm explicitly addresses the foreground-background noise in class activations\nby simultaneously maximizing intra-video and inter-video mutual information\nusing a bottom-up attention mechanism. As a result, activations in the\nforeground regions are emphasized whereas those in the background regions are\nsuppressed, thereby leading to more robust predictions.

For medical images, a desirable method should be\nsensitive enough to detect deviation from normal-appearing tissue of each\nanatomical region; here, anatomy is the context. We introduce a novel approach\nwith two levels of self-supervised representation learning objectives: one on\nthe regional anatomical level and another on the patient-level. We use graph\nneural networks to incorporate the relationship between different anatomical\nregions. The structure of the graph is informed by anatomical correspondences\nbetween each patient and an anatomical atlas. In addition, the graph\nrepresentation has the advantage of handling any arbitrarily sized image in\nfull resolution. Experiments on large-scale Computer Tomography (CT) datasets\nof lung images show that our approach compares favorably to baseline methods\nthat do not account for the context.

With the\nneed to embed additional constraints in the solution, we reformulate the\nfunctional linear discriminant analysis as a regularization problem with an\nappropriate penalty. Inspired by the success of $\\ell_1$-type regularization at\ninducing zero coefficients for scalar variables, we develop a new\nregularization method for functional linear discriminant analysis that\nincorporates an $L^1$-type penalty, $\\int |f|$, to induce zero regions. We\ndemonstrate that our formulation has a well defined solution that contains zero\nregions, achieving a functional sparsity in the sense of domain selection.

While these parental control\nsolutions may help digital parenting, they may also introduce serious security\nand privacy risks to children and parents, due to their elevated privileges and\nhaving access to a significant amount of privacy-sensitive data. In this paper,\nwe present an experimental framework for systematically evaluating security and\nprivacy issues in parental control software and hardware solutions. Using the\ndeveloped framework, we provide the first comprehensive study of parental\ncontrol tools on multiple platforms including network devices, Windows\napplications, Chrome extensions and Android apps. Our analysis uncovers\npervasive security and privacy issues that can lead to leakage of private\ninformation, and/or allow an adversary to fully control the parental control\nsolution, and thereby may directly aid cyberbullying and cyber predators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Dec 2020 17:06:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-14"}

Beside spectral analysis, polarimetry is\nbecoming more and more important, motivated by the development of new\ntechniques which will soon allow to perform measurements also in the X- and\n{\\gamma}-rays. Photons emitted from black hole accretion discs in the soft\nstate are indeed expected to be polarized, with an energy dependence which can\nprovide an estimate of the black hole spin. Calculations performed so far,\nhowever, considered scattering as the only process to determine the\npolarization state of the emitted radiation, implicitly assuming that the\ntemperatures involved are such that material in the disc is entirely ionized.\nIn this work we generalize the problem by calculating the ionization structure\nof a surface layer of the disc with the public code CLOUDY , and then by\ndetermining the polarization properties of the emerging radiation using the\nMonte Carlo code STOKES . This allows us to account for absorption effects\nalongside scattering ones. We show that including absorption can deeply modify\nthe polarization properties of the emerging radiation with respect to what is\nobtained in the pure-scattering limit. As a general rule, we find that the\npolarization degree is larger when absorption is more important, which occurs\ne.g. for low accretion rates and/or spins when the ionization of the matter in\nthe innermost accretion disc regions is far from complete.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Dec 2020 17:14:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-23"}

Fault injection, however, is not\noften relevant to emulate real-world software faults since it \"blindly\" injects\nlarge numbers of faults. It remains indeed challenging to inject few but\nrealistic faults that target a particular functionality in a program. In this\nwork, we introduce IBIR, a fault injection tool that addresses this challenge\nby exploring change patterns associated to user-reported faults. To inject\nrealistic faults, we create mutants by retargeting a bug report driven\nautomated program repair system, i.e., reversing its code transformation\ntemplates. IBIR is further appealing in practice since it requires deep\nknowledge of neither of the code nor the tests, but just of the program's\nrelevant bug reports. Thus, our approach focuses the fault injection on the\nfeature targeted by the bug report. We assess IBIR by considering the Defects4J\ndataset. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the fault\ninjection performed by traditional mutation testing in terms of semantic\nsimilarity with the original bug, when applied at either system or class levels\nof granularity, and provides better, statistically significant, estimations of\ntest effectiveness (fault detection). Additionally, when injecting 100 faults,\nIBIR injects faults that couple with the real ones in 36% of the cases, while\nmutants from mutation testing inject less than 1%. Overall, IBIR targets real\nfunctionality and injects realistic and diverse faults.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Dec 2020 17:19:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-15"}

In the present work,\nwe revisit the physical origin of the mass-velocity relationship $m(v)$ in\njet-driven protostellar outflows.

We find that by excluding the jet contribution, $m(v)$ is satisfyingly\nfitted with a single exponential law, with $v_0$ well in the range of\nobservational values. The jet contribution results in additional components in\nthe mass-velocity relationship. This empirical mass-velocity relationship is\nfound to be valid locally in the outflow. The exponent $v_0$ is almost constant\nin time and for a given level of mixing between the ambient medium and the jet\nmaterial. In general, $v_0$ displays only a weak spatial dependence. A simple\nmodeling of the L1157 outflow successfully reproduces the various components of\nthe observed CO intensity-velocity relationship. Our simulations indicate that\nthese components trace the outflow cavity of swept-up gas and the material\nentrained along the jet, respectively. The CO intensity-velocity exponential\nlaw is naturally explained by the jet-driven outflow model.

This is achieved by accounting for the possibility that players may make\nmistakes while following recommendations independently at each information set\nof the game. After providing an axiomatic definition of EFPCE, we show that one\nalways exists since any perfect (Nash) equilibrium constitutes an EFPCE, and\nthat it is a refinement of EFCE, as any EFPCE is also an EFCE.

While most of interesting cases of\ndisordered hyperuniformity are provided by complex many-body systems like\nliquids or amorphous solids, classical spin chains with certain long-range\ninteractions have been shown to demonstrate the same phenomenon. It is\nwell-known that the transverse field Ising model shows a quantum phase\ntransition (QPT) at zero temperature. Under the quantum effects of a transverse\nmagnetic field, classical hyperuniform spin chains are expected to lose their\nhyperuniformity. High-precision simulations of these cases are complicated\nbecause of the presence of highly nontrivial long-range interactions. We\nperform extensive analysis of these systems using density matrix\nrenormalization group to study the possibilities of phase transitions and the\nmechanism by which they lose hyperuniformity. We discover first-order QPTs in\nthe hyperuniform spin chains. An interesting feature of the phase transitions\nin these disordered hyperuniform spin chains is that, depending on the\nparameter values, the presence of transverse magnetic field may remarkably lead\nto increase in the order of the ground state as measured by the \"$\\tau$ order\nmetric,\" even if hyperuniformity is lost. Therefore, it would be possible to\ndesign materials to target specific novel quantum behaviors in the presence of\na transverse magnetic field. Our numerical investigations suggest that these\nspin chains can show no more than two QPTs. We further analyze the long-range\ninteracting spin chains via the Jordan-Wigner mapping, showing that under the\npairwise interacting approximation and a mean-field treatment, there can be at\nmost two QPTs. Based on these numerical and theoretical explorations, we\nconjecture that these spin chains can show a maximum of two QPTs at zero\ntemperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Dec 2020 18:21:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2020 17:45:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}

We then\nconstruct a fiducial axisymmetric model for the supernova and dust densities,\nfeaturing an exponential dependence on galactocentric radius and height, with\ncore-collapse events in a thin disk and Type Ia events including a thick disk\ncomponent. When no flux limit is applied, our model predicts supernovae are\nintrinsically concentrated in the Galactic plane, with Type Ia events extending\nto higher latitudes reflecting their thick disk component.

Such constructions are especially\ninteresting in light of the recent Xenon-1T excess and of hints from stellar\ncooling. In DFSZ models, for $m_a\\gtrsim 0.1$ eV, scatterings of pions and\nmuons can produce a sizable cosmic background of thermal axions, that behave\nsimilarly to massive neutrinos. However, the pion coupling depends on the\nalignment between the vevs of two Higgs doublets, and can be significantly\nsuppressed or enhanced with respect to the KSVZ scenario. Using the latest\nPlanck and BAO data, we find $m_a\\leq 0.2~\\text{eV}$ at $95\\%$ C.L., when the\naxion coupling to pions $c_{a\\pi}$ is maximal. Constraints on $m_a$, instead,\ncan be significantly relaxed when $c_{a\\pi}$ is small.

In this work, we consider a\nnew target for quantum simulation algorithms; analysing the data arising from\nphysics experiments -- specifically, muon spectroscopy experiments.

Despite the increasing use of word embeddings for text classification,\nthese are generally used in an unsupervised manner, i.e. information derived\nfrom class labels in the training data are not exploited.

In this work we analyze this\ncombination in detail in nonlinear vision models and propose a purely\npsychophysical methodology to quantify the early noise and the late noise. Our\nanalysis generalizes classical results from linear systems (Burgess and\nColborne, 1988) by combining the theory of noise propagation through a\nnonlinear network (Ahumada, 1987) with the expressions to obtain the perceptual\nmetric along the nonlinear network (Malo and Simoncelli, 2006; Laparra,\nMu\\~noz, and Malo, 2010). The proposed method shows that the scale of the late\nnoise can only be determined if the experiments include substantial noise in\nthe input. This means that knowing the magnitude of early noise is necessary as\nit is needed as a scaling factor for the late noise. Moreover, it suggests that\nthe use of external noise in the experiments may be helpful as an extra\nreference. Therefore, we propose to use accurate measurements of pattern\ndiscrimination in external noise, where the spectrum of this external noise was\nwell controlled (Henning, Bird, and Wichmann, 2002). Our psychophysical\nestimate of early noise (assuming a conventional cascade of linear+nonlinear\nstages) is discussed in light of the noise in cone photocurrents computed via\naccurate models of retinal physiology (Brainard and Wandell, 2020). Finally, in\nline with Maximum Differentiation (Wang and Simoncelli, 2008), we discuss how\nto the proposed method may be used to design stimuli to decide between\nalternative vision models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Dec 2020 19:25:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-15"}

Therefore, a detailed study of RR Lyrae will help us\nunderstand the accreted outskirts of the Milky Way. In this contribution, we\npresent the current state of our systematic search for distant RR Lyrae stars\nin the halo using the DECam imager at the 4m telescope on Cerro Tololo (Chile).\nThe total surveyed area consists of more than 110 DECam fields (~ 350 sq. deg)\nand includes two recent independent campaigns carried out in 2017 and 2018 with\nwhich we have detected > 650 candidate RR Lyrae stars.

If the planet is unmagnetized and initially slowly\nrotating, it will accrete gas via a radially narrow boundary layer and rapidly\nspin up. Radial broadening of the boundary layer as the planet spins up reduces\nthe specific angular momentum of accreted gas, allowing the planet to find a\nterminal rotation rate short of the breakup rate. Here, we use axisymmetric\nviscous hydrodynamic simulations to quantify the terminal rotation rate of\nplanets accreting from their circumplanetary disks. For an isothermal\nplanet-disk system with a disk scale height $h/r =0.1$ near the planetary\nsurface, spin up switches to spin down at between 70\\% and 80\\% of the planet's\nbreakup angular velocity. In a qualitative difference from vertically-averaged\nmodels -- where spin down can co-exist with mass accretion -- we observe\n\\emph{decretion} accompanying solutions where angular momentum is being lost.\nThe critical spin rate depends upon the disk thickness near the planet. For an\nisothermal system with a disk scale height of $h/r = 0.15$ near the planet, the\ncritical spin rate drops to between 60\\% and 70\\% of the planet's breakup\nangular velocity. In the disk outside the boundary layer, we identify\nmeridional circulation flows, which are unsteady and instantaneously asymmetric\nacross the mid-plane. The simulated flows are strong enough to vertically\nredistribute solid material in early-stage satellite formation. We discuss how\nextrasolar planetary rotation measurements, when combined with spectroscopic\nand variability studies of protoplanets with circumplanetary disks, could\ndetermine the role of magnetic and non-magnetic processes in setting giant\nplanet spins.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Dec 2020 21:24:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-17"}

We characterize how the large deviation\nrates and rate functions depend on the initial size of the mutant cell\npopulation. We finally look at the large deviations rate of early recurrence\nconditioned on the number of mutant clones present at recurrence in the special\ncase of a deterministically decaying sensitive population. We find that if\nrecurrence occurs before the predicted law of large numbers limit then there\nwill likely be an increase in the number of clones present at recurrence time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Dec 2020 21:38:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Aug 2021 19:24:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-06"}

This paper provides forecasts of a global surface temperature\ntrajectory to 2100 resulting from the effect of these two scenarios. The\ntime-series models developed both displayed high statistical significance and\nconverged in their forecasts, so adding to the potential robustness of the\nfindings. Under the effect of the combination of the peak fossil fuel and\nfirst-difference CO2 scenarios, we found that temperature is forecast to\ncontinue to rise, but only gently, until around 2023 where it reaches a level\nslightly higher than at present; and from then to display an also gentle steady\ndecrease. It is shown that this trajectory is markedly lower than that\ngenerated by the IPCC business-as-usual level-of-CO2 (RCP8.5) model (Riahi et\nal. 2011).

Purpose: In this work we study three such tools in the context of\nnuclear reactions with the goal of constraining the optical potential. Method:\nThe three statistical tools examined are: i) the principal component analysis;\nii) the sensitivity analysis based on derivatives; and iii) the Bayesian\nevidence. We first apply these tools to a toy-model case, comparing the form of\nthe imaginary part of the optical potential. Then we consider two different\nreaction observables, elastic angular distributions and polarization data for\nreactions on 48Ca at two different beam energies. Results: For the toy-model\ncase, we find significant discrimination power in the sensitivities and the\nBayesian evidence, showing clearly that the volume imaginary term is more\nuseful to describe scattering at higher energies. When comparing between\nelastic cross sections and polarization data using realistic optical models,\nsensitivity studies indicate that both observables are roughly equally\nsensitive but the variability of the optical model parameters is strongly angle\ndependent. The Bayesian evidence shows some variability between the two\nobservables, but the Bayes factor obtained is not sufficient to discriminate\nbetween angular distributions and polarization. Conclusions: From the cases\nconsidered, we conclude that in general elastic scattering angular\ndistributions have similar impact in constraining the optical potential\nparameters compared to the polarization data. The angular ranges for the\noptimum experimental constraints can vary significantly with the observable\nconsidered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Dec 2020 21:47:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Dec 2021 22:40:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-22"}

A common but\noften under-studied problem in developing RL agents for continuous control is\nthat the control policies developed are not always smooth. This lack of\nsmoothness can be a major problem when learning controllers %intended for\ndeployment on real hardware as it can result in control instability and\nhardware failure. Issues of noisy control are further accentuated when training\nRL agents in simulation due to simulators ultimately being imperfect\nrepresentations of reality - what is known as the reality gap. To combat issues\nof instability in RL agents, we propose a systematic framework,\n`REinforcement-based transferable Agents through Learning' (RE+AL), for\ndesigning simulated training environments which preserve the quality of trained\nagents when transferred to real platforms.

The hallmark feature of the double descent phenomenon is a spike\nin the regularization gap at the interpolation threshold, i.e. when the number\nof features in the RFM equals the number of training samples. To close this\ngap, the hybrid method considered in our paper combines the respective\nstrengths of the two most common forms of regularization: early stopping and\nweight decay. The scheme does not require hyperparameter tuning as it\nautomatically selects the stopping iteration and weight decay hyperparameter by\nusing generalized cross-validation (GCV). This also avoids the necessity of a\ndedicated validation set. While the benefits of hybrid methods have been\nwell-documented for ill-posed inverse problems, our work presents the first use\ncase in machine learning. To expose the need for regularization and motivate\nhybrid methods, we perform detailed numerical experiments inspired by image\nclassification. In those examples, the hybrid scheme successfully avoids the\ndouble descent phenomenon and yields RFMs whose generalization is comparable\nwith classical regularization approaches whose hyperparameters are tuned\noptimally using the test data.

In this paper, we show that it is possible to\nfully coordinate the GFL and GFM inverters to achieve accurate power sharing,\nfrequency/voltage regulation, and circulating var mitigation in networked\nmicrogrids even without the support of any synchronous generators or the bulk\npower system. We use the leader-follower consensus framework to develop a\nGFM-GFL coordination control. The effectiveness of the proposed coordination is\nverified under different disturbances and communication degradation. In\naddition, we find that the proposed fully-coordinated secondary control\noutperforms other approaches such as un-coordinated and partially-coordinated\nsecondary controls, in aspects of load sharing and frequency and voltage\nregulation. Overall, this study emphasizes the need and benefits of GFL-GFM\ncoordination in microgrids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Dec 2020 00:24:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Oct 2021 23:02:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-01"}

However, training a GAN is\nknown to be a challenging task. This is often attributed to the lack of\ncorrelation between the training progress and the trajectory of the generator\nand discriminator losses and the need for the GAN's subjective evaluation. A\nrecently proposed measure inspired by game theory - the duality gap, aims to\nbridge this gap. However, as we demonstrate, the duality gap's capability\nremains constrained due to limitations posed by its estimation process. This\npaper presents a theoretical understanding of this limitation and proposes a\nmore dependable estimation process for the duality gap. At the crux of our\napproach is the idea that local perturbations can help agents in a zero-sum\ngame escape non-Nash saddle points efficiently. Through exhaustive\nexperimentation across GAN models and datasets, we establish the efficacy of\nour approach in capturing the GAN training progress with minimal increase to\nthe computational complexity. Further, we show that our estimate, with its\nability to identify model convergence/divergence, is a potential performance\nmeasure that can be used to tune the hyperparameters of a GAN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Dec 2020 04:32:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-15"}

However, many real-world tasks require multiple arms, such as\nlifting a heavy object or assembling a desk. Unfortunately, applying IL to\nmulti-arm manipulation tasks has been challenging -- asking a human to control\nmore than one robotic arm can impose significant cognitive burden and is often\nonly possible for a maximum of two robot arms. To address these challenges, we\npresent Multi-Arm RoboTurk (MART), a multi-user data collection platform that\nallows multiple remote users to simultaneously teleoperate a set of robotic\narms and collect demonstrations for multi-arm tasks. Using MART, we collected\ndemonstrations for five novel two and three-arm tasks from several\ngeographically separated users. From our data we arrived at a critical insight:\nmost multi-arm tasks do not require global coordination throughout its full\nduration, but only during specific moments. We show that learning from such\ndata consequently presents challenges for centralized agents that directly\nattempt to model all robot actions simultaneously, and perform a comprehensive\nstudy of different policy architectures with varying levels of centralization\non our tasks. Finally, we propose and evaluate a base-residual policy framework\nthat allows trained policies to better adapt to the mixed coordination setting\ncommon in multi-arm manipulation, and show that a centralized policy augmented\nwith a decentralized residual model outperforms all other models on our set of\nbenchmark tasks.

Recently, multiple papers from different research groups\nconsistently report that learned models have the potential to replace existing\ncardinality estimators. In this paper, we ask a forward-thinking question: Are\nwe ready to deploy these learned cardinality models in production? Our study\nconsists of three main parts. Firstly, we focus on the static environment\n(i.e., no data updates) and compare five new learned methods with eight\ntraditional methods on four real-world datasets under a unified workload\nsetting. The results show that learned models are indeed more accurate than\ntraditional methods, but they often suffer from high training and inference\ncosts. Secondly, we explore whether these learned models are ready for dynamic\nenvironments (i.e., frequent data updates). We find that they cannot catch up\nwith fast data up-dates and return large errors for different reasons. For less\nfrequent updates, they can perform better but there is no clear winner among\nthemselves. Thirdly, we take a deeper look into learned models and explore when\nthey may go wrong. Our results show that the performance of learned methods can\nbe greatly affected by the changes in correlation, skewness, or domain size.\nMore importantly, their behaviors are much harder to interpret and often\nunpredictable. Based on these findings, we identify two promising research\ndirections (control the cost of learned models and make learned models\ntrustworthy) and suggest a number of research opportunities. We hope that our\nstudy can guide researchers and practitioners to work together to eventually\npush learned cardinality estimators into real database systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Dec 2020 06:52:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2020 07:04:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 15 Mar 2021 23:35:27 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 10 Aug 2021 20:39:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-12"}

To address these problems, we transfer discriminatory\ninformation from the face to support the training of a periocular network by\nusing knowledge distillation. Specifically, we leverage face images for\nperiocular embedding learning, but periocular alone is utilized for identity\nidentification or verification. To enhance periocular embeddings by face\neffectively, we proposeConsistent Knowledge Distillation (CKD) that imposes\nconsistency between face and periocular networks across prediction and feature\nlayers. We find that imposing consistency at the prediction layer enables (1)\nextraction of global discriminative relationship information from face images\nand (2) effective transfer of the information from the face network to the\nperiocular network. Particularly, consistency regularizes the prediction units\nto extract and store profound inter-class relationship information of face\nimages. (3) The feature layer consistency, on the other hand, makes the\nperiocular features robust against identity-irrelevant attributes. Overall, CKD\nempowers the sole periocular network to produce robust discriminative\nembeddings for periocular recognition in the wild.

The GRMERS estimator is implemented\nutilizing a Minimum Error Robust Simultaneous (MERS) estimator and Gap Reducing\n(GR) compensators. The MERS estimator provides robust simultaneous estimation\nwith minimal largest worst-case estimation error even in the presence of a\nbounded energy exogenous disturbance signal.

A sufficient condition for the existence of a\nsimultaneous estimator is established using LMIs and robust estimation theory.\nFurther, MERS estimator and GR compensator design are formulated as non-convex\ntractable optimization problems and are solved using the population-based\ngenetic algorithms. The performance of the GRMERS estimator consisting of MERS\nestimator and GR compensators from the population-based genetic algorithms is\nvalidated through simulation studies.

To\neffectively thwart spatial and temporal memory vulnerabilities, full logical\nmemory safety is required. However, current mitigation techniques for memory\nsafety are either too expensive or trade security against efficiency. One\npromising attempt to detect memory safety vulnerabilities in hardware is memory\ncoloring, a security policy deployed on top of tagged memory architectures.\nHowever, due to the memory storage and bandwidth overhead of large tags,\ncommodity tagged memory architectures usually only provide small tag sizes,\nthus limiting their use for security applications. Irrespective of logical\nmemory safety, physical memory safety is a necessity in hostile environments\nprevalent for modern cloud computing and IoT devices. Architectures from Intel\nand AMD already implement transparent memory encryption to maintain\nconfidentiality and integrity of all off-chip data. Surprisingly, the\ncombination of both, logical and physical memory safety, has not yet been\nextensively studied in previous research, and a naive combination of both\nsecurity strategies would accumulate both overheads. In this paper, we propose\nCrypTag, an efficient hardware/software co-design mitigating a large class of\nlogical memory safety issues and providing full physical memory safety. At its\ncore, CrypTag utilizes a transparent memory encryption engine not only for\nphysical memory safety, but also for memory coloring at hardly any additional\ncosts. The design avoids any overhead for tag storage by embedding memory\ncolors in the upper bits of a pointer and using these bits as an additional\ninput for the memory encryption. A custom compiler extension automatically\nleverages CrypTag to detect logical memory safety issues for commodity programs\nand is fully backward compatible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Dec 2020 09:13:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Mar 2021 10:39:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-10"}

We examine: i) the\ncolumn densities of carbon species across the cycle of CII, CI and CO, along\nwith OI, in relation to the HI-to-H$_2$ transition; ii) the velocity-integrated\nemission of [CII]~$158\\mu$m, [$^{13}$CII]~$158\\mu$m, [CI]~$609\\mu$m and\n$370\\mu$m, [OI]~$63\\mu$m and $146\\mu$m, and of the first ten $^{12}$CO\nrotational transitions; iii) the corresponding Spectral Line Energy\nDistributions; iv) the usage of [CII] and [OI]~$63\\mu$m to describe the\ndynamical state of the clouds; v) the behavior of the most commonly used ratios\nbetween transitions of CO and [CI]; and vi) the conversion factors for using CO\nand CI as H$_2$-gas tracers. We find that enhanced cosmic-ray energy densities\nenhance all aforementioned line intensities. At low metallicities, the emission\nof [CII] is well connected with the H$_2$ column, making it a promising new\nH$_2$ tracer in metal-poor environments. The conversion factors of $X_{\\rm CO}$\nand $X_{\\rm CI}$ depend on metallicity and the cosmic-ray ionization rate, but\nnot on FUV intensity. In the era of ALMA, SOFIA and the forthcoming CCAT-prime\ntelescope, our results can be used to understand better the behaviour of\nsystems in a wide range of galactic and extragalactic environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Dec 2020 09:51:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-20"}

For this reason, PSF-subtraction effects is currently the main\nlimitations to the precise characterization of exoplanetary dust with\nscattered-light imaging. Forward-modeling techniques have long been developed\nfor point source objects. However, forward-modeling with disks is complicated\nby the fact that the disk cannot be simplified using a simple point source\nconvolved by the PSF as the astrophysical model; all hypothetical disk\nmorphologies must be explored to understand the subtle and non-linear effects\nof the PSF subtraction algorithm on the shape and local geometry of these\nsystems. Because of their complex geometries, the forward-modeling process has\nto be repeated tens or hundred of thousands of times on disks with slightly\ndifferent physical properties.

However, most existing coverless steganography\nalgorithms select images as carriers, and few studies are reported on coverless\nvideo steganography. In fact, video is a securer and more informative carrier.\nIn this paper, a novel coverless video steganography algorithm based on maximum\nDirect Current (DC) coefficients is proposed. Firstly, a Gaussian distribution\nmodel of DC coefficients considering video coding process is built, which\nindicates that the distribution of changes for maximum DC coefficients in a\nblock is more stable than the adjacent DC coefficients. Then, a novel hash\nsequence generation method based on the maximum DC coefficients is proposed.\nAfter that, the video index structure is established to speed up the efficiency\nof searching videos. In the process of information hiding, the secret\ninformation is converted into binary segments, and the video whose hash\nsequence equals to secret information segment is selected as the carrier\naccording to the video index structure. Finally, all of the selected videos and\nauxiliary information are sent to the receiver. Especially, the subjective\nsecurity of video carriers, the cost of auxiliary information and the\nrobustness to video compression are considered for the first time in this\npaper. Experimental results and analysis show that the proposed algorithm\nperforms better in terms of capacity, robustness, and security, compared with\nthe state-of-the-art coverless steganography algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Dec 2020 13:21:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-15"}

The nature of these\ntransitions is discussed on the basis of first-principles DFT calculation of\ntheir electron-hole Lindhard response function. As a result of stronger\ninter-chain interactions the Fermi surface (FS) and Lindhard function of\nNbSe$_3$ are considerably more complex than those for $m$-TaS$_3$; however a\ncommon scenario can be put forward to rationalize the results. The intra-chain\ninter-band nesting processes dominate the strongest response for both type I\nand type III chains of the two compounds.

Many recent trackers adopt the multiple-stage tracking strategy\nto improve the quality of bounding box estimation. These methods first coarsely\nlocate the target and then refine the initial prediction in the following\nstages. However, existing approaches still suffer from limited precision, and\nthe coupling of different stages severely restricts the method's\ntransferability. This work proposes a novel, flexible, and accurate refinement\nmodule called Alpha-Refine (AR), which can significantly improve the base\ntrackers' box estimation quality.

The\ndesign and evaluation of diffusion models has been subjective and empirical.\nWhen being applied to a network represented by a graph, the diffusion model\ngenerates a sequence of edges on which the influence flows, such sequence forms\na temporal network. In most scenarios, the statistical properties or the\ncharacteristics of a network are inferred by analyzing the temporal networks\ngenerated by diffusion models. To analyze real temporal networks, the motif has\nbeen proposed as a reliable feature. However, it is unclear how the network\ntopology and the diffusion model affect the motif feature of a generated\ntemporal network. In this paper, we adopt the motif feature to evaluate the\ntemporal graph generated by a diffusion model, thence the diffusion model\nitself. Two benchmarks for quantitively evaluating diffusion models with motif,\nstability and separability, are proposed and measured on numerous diffusion\nmodels. One motif-based metric is proposed to measure the similarity between\ndiffusion models. The experiments suggest that the motif of a generated\ntemporal network is dominated by the diffusion model, while the network\ntopology is almost ignored. This result indicates that more practical and\nreliable diffusion models have to be designed with delicacy in order to capture\nthe propagation patterns of real temporal networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Dec 2020 13:35:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-15"}

Despite the better performance of hybrid\nconstraints, they are usually implemented with heavy network architecture. As a\nmatter of fact, previous efforts contribute more as pioneering works in new\ncross-modal Re-ID area while leaving large space for improvement. This can be\nmainly attributed to: (1) lack of abundant person image pairs from different\nmodalities for training, and (2) scarcity of salient modality-invariant\nfeatures especially on coarse representations for effective matching. To\naddress these issues, a novel Multi-Scale Part-Aware Cascading framework\n(MSPAC) is formulated by aggregating multi-scale fine-grained features from\npart to global in a cascading manner, which results in a unified representation\ncontaining rich and enhanced semantic features. Furthermore, a marginal\nexponential centre (MeCen) loss is introduced to jointly eliminate mixed\nvariances from intra- and inter-modal examples.

The two phases of this attack could be regarded as\ntwo QAA instances separately, and the first QAA instance consists of four\nsub-QAA instances. We conclude that the encryption complexity and circuit\ncomplexity of quantum dedicated attacks on 19-round SIMON32/64, 19-round SIMON\n48 and 26-round SIMON64/128 are both lower than those of the quantum exhaustive\nsearch on these variants separately. Our work firstly studies the quantum\ndedicated attack on SIMON block cipher from the perspective of quantum circuit\ncomplexity, which is a more fine-grained analysis of quantum dedicated attacks'\ncomplexity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Dec 2020 02:15:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Jun 2021 11:03:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-03"}

At such a point, the gravitational field equations\nfail. As an alternative to the problem of the singularity arises the existence\nof Exotic Compact Objects (ECOs) that prevent the problem of the singularity\nthrough a transition phase of matter once it has crossed the horizon. ECOs are\ncharacterized by a closeness parameter or cutoff, $\\epsilon$, which measures\nthe degree of compactness of the object. This parameter is established as the\ndifference between the radius of the ECO's surface and the gravitational\nradius. Thus, different values of $\\epsilon$ correspond to different types of\nECOs. If $\\epsilon$ is very big, the ECO behaves more like a star than a black\nhole. On the contrary, if $\\epsilon$ tends to a very small value, the ECO\nbehaves like a black hole. It is considered a conceptual model of the origin of\nthe cutoff for ECOs, when a dust shell contracts gravitationally from an\ninitial position to near the Schwarzschild radius. This allowed us to find that\nthe cutoff makes two types of contributions: a classical one governed by\nGeneral Relativity and one of a quantum nature, if the ECO is very close to the\nhorizon, when estimating that the maximum entropy is contained within the\nmaterial that composes the shell. Such entropy coincides with the\nBekenstein--Hawking entropy. The established cutoff corresponds to a dynamic\nquantity dependent on coordinate time that is measured by a Fiducial Observer\n(FIDO). Without knowing the details about quantum gravity, parameter $\\epsilon$\nis calculated, which, in general, allows distinguishing the ECOs from BHs.\nSpecifically, a black shell (ECO) is undistinguishable from a BH.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Dec 2020 22:48:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-07"}

Thus far, empirical evidence has been unable to\nconclusively determine the validity of these rules, and there is consequently\nmuch controversy regarding the impact of both color and patterns on the visual\nperception of weight.

We gathered a dataset of around 1,000 images of people from\nthe Web together with their ground-truth weight and height, as well as clothing\nattributes about colors and patterns. To elicit the effects of colors and\npatterns, we asked crowd workers to estimate the weight in each image. For the\nanalysis, we controlled potential confounds by matching images in pairs where\nthe two images differ with respect to color or pattern, but are similar with\nrespect to other relevant aspects. We created image pairs in two ways: first,\nobservationally, i.e., from two real images; and second, experimentally, by\nmanipulating the color or pattern of clothing in a real image via photo\nediting. Based on our analysis, we conclude that (1) dark clothes indeed\ndecrease perceived weight slightly but statistically significantly, and (2)\nhorizontal stripes have no discernible effect compared to solid light-colored\nclothes. These results contribute to advancing the debate around the effect of\nspecific clothing colors and patterns and thus provide empirical grounds for\neveryday fashion decisions.

Many studies\nare carried out on this subject, it is aimed to reduce the duration of the\noperation and the processing power required, except to obtain the best result\nwith the changes made in the variables, functions and data in the models used.\nIn this study, in the leaf classification made using Mendeley data set\nconsisting of leaf images with a fixed background, all other variables such as\nlayer number, iteration, number of layers in the model and pooling process were\nkept constant, except for the filter dimensions of the convolution layers in\nthe determined model. Convolution layers in 3 different filter sizes and in\naddition to this, many results obtained in 2 different structures, increasing\nand decreasing, and 3 different image sizes were examined. In the literature,\nit is seen that different uses of pooling layers, changes due to increase or\ndecrease in the number of layers, the difference in the size of the data used,\nand the results of many functions used with different parameters are evaluated.\nIn the leaf classification of the determined data set with CNN, the change in\nthe filter size of the convolution layer together with the change in different\nfilter combinations and in different sized images was focused. Using the data\nset and data reproduction methods, it was aimed to make the differences in\nfilter sizes and image sizes more distinct. Using the fixed number of\niterations, model and data set, the effect of different filter sizes has been\nobserved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Dec 2020 11:05:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-05"}
