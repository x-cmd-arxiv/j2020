The same linguistic\ninquiry (e.g., How are you?) might induce responses with different affects\ndepending on the affective state of the conversational partner(s) and the\ncontext of the conversation. Yet, most dialog systems do not consider affect as\nconstitutive aspect of response generation. In this paper, we introduce\nAffectON, an approach for generating affective responses during inference. For\ngenerating language in a targeted affect, our approach leverages a\nprobabilistic language model and an affective space. AffectON is language model\nagnostic, since it can work with probabilities generated by any language model\n(e.g., sequence-to-sequence models, neural language models, n-grams). Hence, it\ncan be employed for both affective dialog and affective language generation. We\nexperimented with affective dialog generation and evaluated the generated text\nobjectively and subjectively. For the subjective part of the evaluation, we\ndesigned a custom user interface for rating and provided recommendations for\nthe design of such interfaces. The results, both subjective and objective\ndemonstrate that our approach is successful in pulling the generated language\ntoward the targeted affect, with little sacrifice in syntactic coherence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Dec 2020 16:02:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-15"}

As user profiles are generally not available in this\nscenario, capturing the user intent lying in the item transitions plays a\npivotal role. Recent graph neural networks (GNNs) based SBR methods regard the\nitem transitions as pairwise relations, which neglect the complex high-order\ninformation among items. Hypergraph provides a natural way to capture\nbeyond-pairwise relations, while its potential for SBR has remained unexplored.\nIn this paper, we fill this gap by modeling session-based data as a hypergraph\nand then propose a hypergraph convolutional network to improve SBR. Moreover,\nto enhance hypergraph modeling, we devise another graph convolutional network\nwhich is based on the line graph of the hypergraph and then integrate\nself-supervised learning into the training of the networks by maximizing mutual\ninformation between the session representations learned via the two networks,\nserving as an auxiliary task to improve the recommendation task.

In this paper, we present an end-to-end autoencoder-based multiple\ninstance neural network (AMINN) for the prediction of survival outcomes in\nmultifocal CRLM patients using radiomic features extracted from\ncontrast-enhanced MRIs. Specifically, we jointly train an autoencoder to\nreconstruct input features and a multiple instance network to make predictions\nby aggregating information from all tumour lesions of a patient. Also, we\nincorporate a two-step normalization technique to improve the training of deep\nneural networks, built on the observation that the distributions of radiomic\nfeatures are almost always severely skewed.

In this paper, we look\ninto two problem types: one that does not rely on the initial condition, and\nthe other that is initial condition dependent. Data Assimilation is\ndemonstrated on two examples: runoff monitoring and forecasting in the city of\nDhaka (initial condition independent) and convection in the atmosphere (initial\ncondition dependent). We show that standard DA works well for problems with no\ninitial condition dependence and piecewise DA is to be utilized when the\nproblem has initial condition dependence.

In order to get insight on the\ncontent of the model in the case of the complicated heavy-ion reactions,\nresults are compared with those of the semiclassical transfer to the continuum\n(TC) model. Because the TC is based on analytical formulae the dynamics of the\nbreakup as it is contained in the rather involved IAV formalism will become\nmore transparent.

Current\nprogress in these materials is dependent on the interface engineering for the\noptimization of spin transmission. Here, we advance the analysis of ultrafast\nspin-charge conversion phenomena at ferromagnetic-transition metal interfaces\ndue to their inverse spin-Hall effect properties. In particular the intrinsic\ninverse spin Hall effect of Pt-based systems and extrinsic inverse spin-Hall\neffect of Au:W and Au:Ta in NiFe/Au:(W,Ta) bilayers are investigated. The\nspin-charge conversion is probed by complementary techniques -- ultrafast THz\ntime domain spectroscopy in the dynamic regime for THz pulse emission and\nferromagnetic resonance spin-pumping measurements in the GHz regime in the\nsteady state -- to determine the role played by the material properties,\nresistivities, spin transmission at metallic interfaces and spin-flip rates.\nThese measurements show the correspondence between the THz time domain\nspectroscopy and ferromagnetic spin-pumping for the different set of samples in\nterm of the spin mixing conductance. The latter quantity is a critical\nparameter, determining the strength of the THz emission from spintronic\ninterfaces. This is further supported by ab-initio calculations, simulations\nand analysis of the spin-diffusion and spin relaxation of carriers within the\nmultilayers in the time domain, permitting to determine the main trends and the\nrole of spin transmission at interfaces. This work illustrates that time domain\nspectroscopy for spin-based THz emission is a powerful technique to probe\nspin-dynamics at active spintronic interfaces and to extract key material\nproperties for spin-charge conversion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Dec 2020 20:07:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-15"}

As\nsecondary cues, colours and textures are also beneficial in this regard.\nConvolutional neural networks (CNNs), an imitation of biological neural\nnetworks, have been shown to exhibit conflicting properties. Some studies\nindicate that CNNs are biased towards textures whereas, another set of studies\nsuggests shape bias for a classification task. However, they do not discuss the\nrole of colours, implying its possible humble role in the task of object\nrecognition. In this paper, we empirically investigate the importance of\ncolours in object recognition for CNNs. We are able to demonstrate that CNNs\noften rely heavily on colour information while making a prediction. Our results\nshow that the degree of dependency on colours tend to vary from one dataset to\nanother. Moreover, networks tend to rely more on colours if trained from\nscratch. Pre-training can allow the model to be less colour dependent. To\nfacilitate these findings, we follow the framework often deployed in\nunderstanding role of colours in object recognition for humans. We evaluate a\nmodel trained with congruent images (images in original colours eg. red\nstrawberries) on congruent, greyscale, and incongruent images (images in\nunnatural colours eg. blue strawberries).

Its origin lies in the nature\nof quantum entanglement, although understanding the precise relationship\nbetween nonlocality and entanglement has been a notorious open problem. In this\npaper, we resolve this problem by developing a dynamical framework in which\nquantum Bell nonlocality emerges as special form of entanglement, and both are\nunified as resources under local operations and classical communication (LOCC).\nOur framework is built on the notion of quantum processes, which are abstract\nquantum channels mapping elements between fixed intervals in space and time.\nEntanglement is then identified as a quantum process that cannot be generated\nby LOCC while Bell nonlocality is the subset of these processes that have an\ninstantaneous input-output delay time. LOCC pre-processing is a natural set of\nfree operations in this theory, thereby enabling all entangled states to\nactivate some form of Bell nonlocality. In addition, we generalize the CHSH\nwitnesses from the state domain to the domain of entangled quantum\nmeasurements, and provide a systematic method to quantify the Bell nonlocality\nof a bipartite quantum channel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Dec 2020 23:02:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-03"}

We formally\nconsider offline policy selection as learning preferences over a set of policy\nprospects given a fixed experience dataset.

We propose BayesDICE for estimating this belief\ndistribution in terms of posteriors of distribution correction ratios derived\nfrom stochastic constraints (as opposed to explicit likelihood, which is not\navailable). Empirically, BayesDICE is highly competitive to existing\nstate-of-the-art approaches in confidence interval estimation. More\nimportantly, we show how the belief distribution estimated by BayesDICE may be\nused to rank policies with respect to any arbitrary downstream policy selection\nmetric, and we empirically demonstrate that this selection procedure\nsignificantly outperforms existing approaches, such as ranking policies\naccording to mean or high-confidence lower bound value estimates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 12 Dec 2020 23:09:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-15"}

This is consistent with the redshift of the previous grism\nobservations, supporting GN-z11 as the most distant galaxy known to date. Its\nUV lines likely originate from dense ionized gas that is rarely seen at low\nredshifts, and its strong [C III] and C III] emission is partly due to an\nactive galactic nucleus (AGN) or enhanced carbon abundance. GN-z11 is luminous\nand young, yet moderately massive, implying a rapid build-up of stellar mass in\nthe past.

A central problem in conversational grocery is the automatic\ngeneration of short product titles that can be read out fast during a\nconversation. Several supervised models have been proposed in the literature\nthat leverage manually labeled datasets and additional product features to\ngenerate short titles automatically. However, obtaining large amounts of\nlabeled data is expensive and most grocery item pages are not as feature-rich\nas other categories. To address this problem we propose a pre-training based\nsolution that makes use of unlabeled data to learn contextual product\nrepresentations which can then be fine-tuned to obtain better title compression\neven in a low resource setting.

Here, we propose and theoretically analyze a magnetic tunnel junction\nwith no fixed layers but two free layers that are circularly shaped disk\nmagnets.

Most existing group comparison methods use features extracted from\nthe fMRI time series, such as connectivity features, independent component\nanalysis (ICA), and functional connectivity density (FCD) methods. However, in\ngroup studies, especially in the case of spectrum disorders, distances to a\nsingle atlas or a representative subject do not fully reflect the differences\nbetween subjects that may lie on a multi-dimensional spectrum. Moreover, there\nmay not exist an individual subject or even an average atlas in such cases that\nis representative of all subjects. Here we describe an approach that measures\npairwise distances between the synchronized rs-fMRI signals of pairs of\nsubjects instead of to a single reference point. We also present a method for\nfMRI data comparison that leverages this generated pairwise feature to\nestablish a radial basis function kernel matrix. This kernel matrix is used in\nturn to perform kernel regression of rs-fMRI to a clinical variable such as a\ncognitive or neurophysiological performance score of interest. This method\nopens a new pointwise analysis paradigm for fMRI data. We demonstrate the\napplication of this method by performing a pointwise analysis on the cortical\nsurface using rs-fMRI data to identify cortical regions associated with\nvariability in ADHD index. While pointwise analysis methods are common in\nanatomical studies such as cortical thickness analysis and voxel- and\ntensor-based morphometry and its variants, such a method is lacking for rs-fMRI\nand could improve the utility of rs-fMRI for group studies.

These attacks vary from exploiting\nbackdoors to disrupting the communication network of the devices. Intrusion\nDetection Systems (IDS) play an essential role in ensuring information privacy\nand security of IoT devices against these attacks. Recently, deep\nlearning-based IDS techniques are becoming more prominent due to their high\nclassification accuracy. However, conventional deep learning techniques\njeopardize user privacy due to the transfer of user data to a centralized\nserver. Federated learning (FL) is a popular privacy-preserving decentralized\nlearning method. FL enables training models locally at the edge devices and\ntransferring local models to a centralized server instead of transferring\nsensitive data. Nevertheless, FL can suffer from reverse engineering ML attacks\nthat can learn information about the user's data from model. To overcome the\nproblem of reverse engineering, mimic learning is another way to preserve the\nprivacy of ML-based IDS. In mimic learning, a student model is trained with the\npublic dataset, which is labeled with the teacher model that is trained by\nsensitive user data. In this work, we propose a novel approach that combines\nthe advantages of FL and mimic learning, namely federated mimic learning to\ncreate a distributed IDS while minimizing the risk of jeopardizing users'\nprivacy, and benchmark its performance compared to other ML-based IDS\ntechniques using NSL-KDD dataset.

Building on top of two-stream CNNs, GeoNet++ captures the\ngeometric relationships between depth and surface normals with the proposed\ndepth-to-normal and normal-to-depth modules. In particular, the\n\"depth-to-normal\" module exploits the least square solution of estimating\nsurface normals from depth to improve their quality, while the\n\"normal-to-depth\" module refines the depth map based on the constraints on\nsurface normals through kernel regression. Boundary information is exploited\nvia an edge-aware refinement module. GeoNet++ effectively predicts depth and\nsurface normals with strong 3D consistency and sharp boundaries resulting in\nbetter reconstructed 3D scenes. Note that GeoNet++ is generic and can be used\nin other depth/normal prediction frameworks to improve the quality of 3D\nreconstruction and pixel-wise accuracy of depth and surface normals.\nFurthermore, we propose a new 3D geometric metric (3DGM) for evaluating depth\nprediction in 3D. In contrast to current metrics that focus on evaluating\npixel-wise error/accuracy, 3DGM measures whether the predicted depth can\nreconstruct high-quality 3D surface normals. This is a more natural metric for\nmany 3D application domains.

In\npractice, mobility patterns of an entire population is never available, and we\nusually have access to location data of a subset of individuals. In this paper,\nwe formalize and study the problem of estimating the spread of a phenomena in a\npopulation, given that we only have access to sub-samples of location visits of\nsome individuals in the population. We show that simple solutions such as\nestimating the spread in the sub-sample and scaling it to the population, or\nmore sophisticated solutions that rely on modeling location visits of\nindividuals do not perform well in practice, the former because it ignores\ncontacts between unobserved individuals and sampled ones and the latter because\nit yields inaccurate modeling of co-locations.

We introduce PollSpreader and\nPollSusceptible, two novel approaches that model the co-locations between\nindividuals using a contact network, and infer the properties of the contact\nnetwork using the subsample to estimate the spread of the phenomena in the\nentire population. We show that our estimates provide an upper bound and a\nlower bound on the spread of the disease in expectation. Finally, using a large\nhigh-resolution real-world mobility dataset, we experimentally show that our\nestimates are accurate, while other methods that do not correctly account for\nco-locations between individuals result in wrong observations (e.g, premature\nherd-immunity).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Dec 2020 07:13:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-20"}

Besides, encoding\nmultiple existing utterances endows C2C with a wider view of existing\nexpressions, helping to reduce generation that duplicates existing data.\nExperiments on ATIS and Snips datasets show that instances augmented by\nC2C-GenDA improve slot filling by 7.99 (11.9%) and 5.76 (13.6%) F-scores\nrespectively, when there are only hundreds of training utterances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Dec 2020 08:35:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-15"}

Current learning\ntechniques, however, have a major drawback that these models are mostly trained\non datasets labeled for particular downstream tasks, and code representations\nmay not be suitable for other tasks. While some techniques produce\nrepresentations from unlabeled code, they are far from satisfactory when\napplied to downstream tasks. Although certain techniques generate\nrepresentations from unlabeled code when applied to downstream tasks they are\nfar from satisfactory. This paper proposes InferCode to overcome the limitation\nby adapting the self-supervised learning mechanism to build source code model.\nThe key novelty lies in training code representations by predicting\nautomatically identified subtrees from the context of the ASTs. Subtrees in\nASTs are treated with InferCode as the labels for training code representations\nwithout any human labeling effort or the overhead of expensive graph\nconstruction, and the trained representations are no longer tied to any\nspecific downstream tasks or code units. We trained an InferCode model instance\nusing the Tree-based CNN as the encoder of a large set of Java code and applied\nit to downstream unsupervised tasks such as code clustering, code clone\ndetection, cross-language code search or reused under a transfer learning\nscheme to continue training the model weights for supervised tasks such as code\nclassification and method name prediction. Compared to previous code learning\ntechniques applied to the same downstream tasks, such as Code2Vec, Code2Seq,\nASTNN, higher performance results are achieved using our pre-trained InferCode\nmodel with a significant margin for most tasks including those involving\ndifferent programming languages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Dec 2020 10:33:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2020 16:37:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-16"}

Despite that\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have achieved good performance for this\ntask, they rely on a large set of labeled images for training, which is\nexpensive and time-consuming to acquire. In this paper, we propose a novel\nframework with Uncertainty Rectified Pyramid Consistency (URPC) regularization\nfor semi-supervised NPC GTV segmentation. Concretely, we extend a backbone\nsegmentation network to produce pyramid predictions at different scales. The\npyramid predictions network (PPNet) is supervised by the ground truth of\nlabeled images and a multi-scale consistency loss for unlabeled images,\nmotivated by the fact that prediction at different scales for the same input\nshould be similar and consistent. However, due to the different resolution of\nthese predictions, encouraging them to be consistent at each pixel directly has\nlow robustness and may lose some fine details. To address this problem, we\nfurther design a novel uncertainty rectifying module to enable the framework to\ngradually learn from meaningful and reliable consensual regions at different\nscales. Experimental results on a dataset with 258 NPC MR images showed that\nwith only 10% or 20% images labeled, our method largely improved the\nsegmentation performance by leveraging the unlabeled images, and it also\noutperformed five state-of-the-art semi-supervised segmentation methods.\nMoreover, when only 50% images labeled, URPC achieved an average Dice score of\n82.74% that was close to fully supervised learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Dec 2020 11:45:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 27 Feb 2021 07:16:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 4 Mar 2021 06:04:41 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 4 Jun 2021 03:31:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-07"}

To address\nthis problem, we present a one-shot framework for organ and landmark\nlocalization in volumetric medical images, which does not need any annotation\nduring the training stage and could be employed to locate any landmarks or\norgans in test images given a support (reference) image during the inference\nstage. Our main idea comes from that tissues and organs from different human\nbodies have a similar relative position and context. Therefore, we could\npredict the relative positions of their non-local patches, thus locate the\ntarget organ. Our framework is composed of three parts: (1) A projection\nnetwork trained to predict the 3D offset between any two patches from the same\nvolume, where human annotations are not required. In the inference stage, it\ntakes one given landmark in a reference image as a support patch and predicts\nthe offset from a random patch to the corresponding landmark in the test\n(query) volume. (2) A coarse-to-fine framework contains two projection\nnetworks, providing more accurate localization of the target. (3) Based on the\ncoarse-to-fine model, we transfer the organ boundingbox (B-box) detection to\nlocating six extreme points along x, y and z directions in the query volume.\nExperiments on multi-organ localization from head-and-neck (HaN) CT volumes\nshowed that our method acquired competitive performance in real time, which is\nmore accurate and 10^5 times faster than template matching methods with the\nsame setting.

Given a budget for labelling, active learning aims to\nimprove performance by carefully choosing which nodes to label. Previous graph\nactive learning methods learn representations using labelled nodes and select\nsome unlabelled nodes for label acquisition. However, they do not fully utilize\nthe representation power present in unlabelled nodes. We argue that the\nrepresentation power in unlabelled nodes can be useful for active learning and\nfor further improving performance of active learning for node classification.\nIn this paper, we propose a latent space clustering-based active learning\nframework for node classification (LSCALE), where we fully utilize the\nrepresentation power in both labelled and unlabelled nodes. Specifically, to\nselect nodes for labelling, our framework uses the K-Medoids clustering\nalgorithm on a latent space based on a dynamic combination of both unsupervised\nfeatures and supervised features.

In\nthat way, The mathematical form of an equipartition theorem can be related to\nthe algebraic expression of a particular entropy, different from the standard\nBekenstein entropy, initially chosen to describe the black hole event horizon,\nsee E. M. C. Abreu et al., MPLA 32, 2050266 (2020). Motivated by these works,\nwe address three new uncertainty principles leading to recently introduced\ngeneralized entropies. In addition, the corresponding energy-time uncertainty\nrelations and Unruh temperatures are also calculated. As a result, it seems\nthat systems described by generalized entropies, such as those of Tsallis, do\nnot necessarily meet HUP and may satisfy modified forms of HUP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Dec 2020 06:05:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Apr 2021 05:23:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-11"}

Most LP algorithms estimate a score for currently non-neighboring\nnode pairs, and rank them by this score. Recent LP systems compute this score\nby comparing dense, low dimensional vector representations of nodes. Graph\nneural networks (GNNs), in particular graph convolutional networks (GCNs), are\npopular examples. For two nodes to be meaningfully compared, their embeddings\nshould be indifferent to reordering of their neighbors. GNNs typically use\nsimple, symmetric set aggregators to ensure this property, but this design\ndecision has been shown to produce representations with limited expressive\npower. Sequence encoders are more expressive, but are permutation sensitive by\ndesign. Recent efforts to overcome this dilemma turn out to be unsatisfactory\nfor LP tasks. In response, we propose PermGNN, which aggregates neighbor\nfeatures using a recurrent, order-sensitive aggregator and directly minimizes\nan LP loss while it is `attacked' by adversarial generator of neighbor\npermutations. By design, PermGNN{} has more expressive power compared to\nearlier symmetric aggregators. Next, we devise an optimization framework to map\nPermGNN's node embeddings to a suitable locality-sensitive hash, which speeds\nup reporting the top-$K$ most likely edges for the LP task. Our experiments on\ndiverse datasets show that \\our outperforms several state-of-the-art link\npredictors by a significant margin, and can predict the most likely edges fast.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Dec 2020 03:52:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 28 Mar 2021 04:13:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-30"}

In the analysis of rare events in\nstochastic dynamics, it plays a central role in characterizing the statistics\nof transition events and the likely transition paths. However, computing the\nquasipotential is challenging, especially in high dimensional dynamical systems\nwhere a global landscape is sought. Traditional methods based on the dynamic\nprogramming principle or path space minimization tend to suffer from the curse\nof dimensionality. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient machine\nlearning method to resolve this problem. The key idea is to learn an orthogonal\ndecomposition of the vector field that drives the dynamics, from which one can\nidentify the quasipotential. We demonstrate on various example systems that our\nmethod can effectively compute quasipotential landscapes without requiring\nspatial discretization or solving path-space optimization problems. Moreover,\nthe method is purely data driven in the sense that only observed trajectories\nof the dynamics are required for the computation of the quasipotential. These\nproperties make it a promising method to enable the general application of\nquasipotential analysis to dynamical systems away from equilibrium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Dec 2020 02:32:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-17"}

Instability of the\neconomy is the instability of the difference equation about the equilibrium\nprice around the full-employment equilibrium, which means that a fall in the\nnominal wage rate caused by the presence of involuntary unemployment further\nreduces employment. This instability is due to the negative real balance effect\nthat occurs when consumers' net savings (the difference between savings and\npensions) are smaller than their debt multiplied by the marginal propensity to\nconsume from childhood consumption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 13 Dec 2020 09:23:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-23"}
