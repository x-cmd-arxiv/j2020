DRG is\nbased on decoupling the input-output dynamics of the system, followed by the\ndeployment of a bank of SRGs for each decoupled channel. We present two\nformulations of DRG: DRG-tf, which is based on system decoupling using transfer\nfunctions, and DRG-ss, which is built on state feedback decoupling. A detailed\nset-theoretic analysis of DRG, which highlights its main characteristics, is\npresented. We also show a quantitative comparison between DRG and the VRG to\nillustrate the computational advantages of DRG. The robustness of this approach\nto disturbances and uncertainties is also investigated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Dec 2020 16:04:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-04"}

In this paper, we derived the population version of Spearman's rho\ncorrelation via copulas when both random variables are discrete. The\nclosed-form expressions of the Spearman correlation are obtained for some\ncopulas of simple structure such as Archimedean copulas with different marginal\ndistributions. We derive the upper bound and the lower bound of the Spearman's\nrho for Bernoulli random variables. Then, the proposed Spearman's rho\ncorrelations are compared with their corresponding Kendall's tau values.

Such systems comprise of a large number of\nsensor devices at fixed locations, wherein each individual sensor obtains\nmeasurements that are subsequently fused and processed at a central processing\nnode. A key problem for such systems is to detect targets and identify their\nlocations, for which a large body of literature has been developed focusing\nprimarily on employing parametric models for signal attenuation from target to\ndevice. In this paper, we adopt a nonparametric approach that only assumes that\nthe signal is nonincreasing as function of the distance between the sensor and\nthe target. We propose a simple tuning parameter free estimator for the target\nlocation, namely, the simple score estimator (SSCE). We show that the SSCE is\n$\\sqrt{n}$ consistent and has a Gaussian limit distribution which can be used\nto construct asymptotic confidence regions for the location of the target.

Gaia Early Data Release 3 (Gaia EDR3) provides accurate astrometry\nfor about 1.6 million compact (QSO-like) extragalactic sources, 1.2 million of\nwhich have the best-quality five-parameter astrometric solutions.\n  Aims. The proper motions of QSO-like sources are used to reveal a systematic\npattern due to the acceleration of the solar system barycentre with respect to\nthe rest frame of the Universe. Apart from being an important scientific result\nby itself, the acceleration measured in this way is a good quality indicator of\nthe Gaia astrometric solution. Methods. The effect of the acceleration is\nobtained as a part of the general expansion of the vector field of proper\nmotions in Vector Spherical Harmonics (VSH). Various versions of the VSH fit\nand various subsets of the sources are tried and compared to get the most\nconsistent result and a realistic estimate of its uncertainty. Additional tests\nwith the Gaia astrometric solution are used to get a better idea on possible\nsystematic errors in the estimate.\n  Results. Our best estimate of the acceleration based on Gaia EDR3 is $(2.32\n\\pm 0.16) \\times 10^{-10}$ m s${}^{-2}$ (or $7.33 \\pm 0.51$ km s$^{-1}$\nMyr${}^{-1}$) towards $\\alpha = 269.1^\\circ \\pm 5.4^\\circ$, $\\delta =\n-31.6^\\circ \\pm 4.1^\\circ$, corresponding to a proper motion amplitude of $5.05\n\\pm 0.35$ $\\mu$as yr${}^{-1}$.

The key technical\ningredient was an SU(1, 1) group and Lie algebra structure of the physical\nobservables as well as the use of Perelomov coherent states for SU(1, 1). It\nwas shown that the coarse graining operation is completely captured by changing\ngroup representations. Based on this result, it was subsequently shown that one\ncan extract an explicit renormalisation group flow of the loop quantum\ncosmology Hamiltonian operator in a simple model with dust-clock. In this\npaper, we continue this line of investigation and derive a coherent state path\nintegral formulation of this quantum theory and extract an explicit expression\nfor the renormalisation-scale dependent classical Hamiltonian entering the path\nintegral for a coarse grained description at that scale. We find corrections to\nthe non-renormalised Hamiltonian that are qualitatively similar to those\npreviously investigated via canonical quantisation. In particular, they are\nagain most sensitive to small quantum numbers, showing that the large quantum\nnumber (spin) description captured by so called \"effective equations\" in loop\nquantum cosmology does not reproduce the physics of many small quantum numbers\n(spins). Our results have direct impact on path integral quantisation in loop\nquantum gravity, showing that the usually taken large spin limit should be\nexpected not to capture (without renormalisation, as mostly done) the physics\nof many small spins that is usually assumed to be present in physically\nreasonable quantum states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Dec 2020 16:57:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-30"}

This\nis ultimately performed by point spread function (PSF) fitting, which in turn\nrequires an accurate reconstruction of the PSF. Gaia Early Data Release 3\n(EDR3) will, for the first time, use a PSF calibration that models several of\nthe strongest dependences, leading to signficantly reduced systematic errors.\nAims: We describe the PSF model and calibration pipeline implemented for Gaia\nEDR3, including an analysis of the calibration results over the 34 months of\ndata. We include a discussion of the limitations of the current pipeline and\ndirections for future releases. This will be of use both to users of Gaia data\nand as a reference for other precision astrometry missions. Methods: We develop\nmodels of the 1D line spread function (LSF) and 2D PSF profiles based on a\nlinear combination of basis components. We fit the models to selected primary\nsources in independent time ranges, using simple parameterisations for the\ncolour and other dependences. Variation in time is smoothed by merging the\nindependent calibrations in a square root information filter, with resets at\ncertain mission events that induce a discontinuous change in the PSF. Results:\nThe PSF calibration shows strong time and colour dependences that accurately\nreproduce the varying state of the Gaia astrometric instrument. Analysis of the\nresiduals reveals both the performance and the limitations of the current\nmodels and calibration pipeline, and indicates the directions for future\ndevelopment. Conclusions: The PSF modelling and calibration carried out for\nGaia EDR3 represents a major step forwards in the data processing and will lead\nto reduced systematic errors in the core mission data products. Further\nsignificant improvements are expected in the future data releases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Dec 2020 16:57:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-28"}

We focus on the\nunconcentrated component of the EPIC/pn background - supposedly related to\ncosmic rays interacting with the telescope. We find that the out-field of view\nregion of the pn detector is actually exposed to the sky. After cleaning from\nthe sky contamination, the unconcentrated background does not show significant\nspatial variations and its time behaviour is anti-correlated with the solar\ncycle.

We investigate that segmenting a\nbrain tumor is facing to the imbalanced data problem where the number of pixels\nbelonging to the background class (non tumor pixel) is much larger than the\nnumber of pixels belonging to the foreground class (tumor pixel). To address\nthis problem, we propose a multi-task network which is formed as a cascaded\nstructure. Our model consists of two targets, i.e., (i) effectively\ndifferentiate the brain tumor regions and (ii) estimate the brain tumor mask.\nThe first objective is performed by our proposed contextual brain tumor\ndetection network, which plays a role of an attention gate and focuses on the\nregion around brain tumor only while ignoring the far neighbor background which\nis less correlated to the tumor. The second objective is built upon a 3D atrous\nresidual network and under an encode-decode network in order to effectively\nsegment both large and small objects (brain tumor). Our 3D atrous residual\nnetwork is designed with a skip connection to enables the gradient from the\ndeep layers to be directly propagated to shallow layers, thus, features of\ndifferent depths are preserved and used for refining each other. In order to\nincorporate larger contextual information from volume MRI data, our network\nutilizes the 3D atrous convolution with various kernel sizes, which enlarges\nthe receptive field of filters. Our proposed network has been evaluated on\nvarious datasets including BRATS2015, BRATS2017 and BRATS2018 datasets with\nboth validation set and testing set.

Moreover, because of the particular masses of black\nholes in the current sample of gravitational-wave sources, the correlations\nimposed by the two experiments are aligned and of similar magnitudes when\nexpressed in terms of the far field, post-Newtonian predictions of the metrics.\nIf a future coalescing black-hole binary with two low-mass (e.g., ~3 Msun)\ncomponents is discovered, the degeneracy between the deviation parameters can\nbe broken by combining the inspiral constraints with those from the black-hole\nshadow measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Dec 2020 17:51:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-26"}

In this paper, we address this gap by analyzing and\nevaluating the throughput and capacity performance of LEO NTN. The evaluation\nresults show that the downlink capacity of a LEO satellite in S band with 30\nMHz bandwidth serving handheld terminal is about 600 Mbps and the downlink\ncapacity of a LEO satellite in Ka band with 400 MHz bandwidth serving very\nsmall aperture terminal (VSAT) is about 7 Gbps. For a LEO NTN similar to the\nKuiper project proposed by Amazon, we find that, due to the large cell sizes in\nthe LEO NTN, the area capacity density is moderate: 1-10 kbps/km$^2$ in the S\nband downlink and 14-120 kbps/km$^2$ in the Ka band downlink depending on\nlatitude.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Dec 2020 18:16:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-04"}

It can be found in a\nbroad spectrum of applications, ranging from neuroscience to power-grids, to\nmention a few. Such systems synchronize because of the complex set of coupling\nthey exhibit, the latter being modeled by complex networks. The dynamical\nbehavior of the system and the topology of the underlying network are strongly\nintertwined, raising the question of the optimal architecture that makes\nsynchronization robust. The Master Stability Function (MSF) has been proposed\nand extensively studied as a generic framework to tackle synchronization\nproblems. Using this method, it has been shown that for a class of models,\nsynchronization in strongly directed networks is robust to external\nperturbations. In this paper, our approach is to transform the non-autonomous\nsystem of coupled oscillators into an autonomous one, showing that previous\nresults are model-independent. Recent findings indicate that many real-world\nnetworks are strongly directed, being potential candidates for optimal\nsynchronization. Inspired by the fact that highly directed networks are also\nstrongly non-normal, in this work, we address the matter of non-normality by\npointing out that standard techniques, such as the MSF, may fail in predicting\nthe stability of synchronized behavior. These results lead to a trade-off\nbetween non-normality and directedness that should be properly considered when\ndesigning an optimal network, enhancing the robustness of synchronization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Dec 2020 18:24:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 2020 23:26:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}

This practice is subjective, inconsistent, slow, and\ndiscontinuous. To develop a reliable medical interpretation, several automated\napproaches have been proposed to enhance the current practice. These approaches\nare unimodal and focus mainly on assessing neonatal procedural (acute) pain. As\npain is a multimodal emotion that is often expressed through multiple\nmodalities, the multimodal assessment of pain is necessary especially in case\nof postoperative (acute prolonged) pain. Additionally, spatio-temporal analysis\nis more stable over time and has been proven to be highly effective at\nminimizing misclassification errors. In this paper, we present a novel\nmultimodal spatio-temporal approach that integrates visual and vocal signals\nand uses them for assessing neonatal postoperative pain. We conduct\ncomprehensive experiments to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed\napproach. We compare the performance of the multimodal and unimodal\npostoperative pain assessment, and measure the impact of temporal information\nintegration. The experimental results, on a real-world dataset, show that the\nproposed multimodal spatio-temporal approach achieves the highest AUC (0.87)\nand accuracy (79%), which are on average 6.67% and 6.33% higher than unimodal\napproaches. The results also show that the integration of temporal information\nmarkedly improves the performance as compared to the non-temporal approach as\nit captures changes in the pain dynamic. These results demonstrate that the\nproposed approach can be used as a viable alternative to manual assessment,\nwhich would tread a path toward fully automated pain monitoring in clinical\nsettings, point-of-care testing, and homes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Dec 2020 18:52:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-04"}

In the present study,\nwe perform a series of isothermal magnetohydrodynamics simulations of filament\nformation. We focus on the influences of shock velocity and turbulence on the\nformation mechanism and identified three different mechanisms for the filament\nformation. The results indicate that when the shock is fast, at shock velocity\nv_sh = 7 km/s, the gas flows driven by the curved shock wave create filaments\nirrespective of the presence of turbulence and self-gravity. However, at a slow\nshock velocity v_sh = 2.5 km/s, the compressive flow component involved in the\ninitial turbulence induces filament formation. When both the shock velocities\nand turbulence are low, the self-gravity in the shock-compressed sheet becomes\nimportant for filament formation. Moreover, we analyzed the line-mass\ndistribution of the filaments and showed that strong shock waves can naturally\ncreate high-line-mass filaments such as those observed in the massive\nstar-forming regions in a short time.

To\nimprove the higher-mode content, and in particular to facilitate an accurate\nincorporation of precession effects in the strong-field regime into waveform\nmodels, we introduce a new dimensional reduction through an effective\nprecession spin vector, $\\vec{\\chi}_\\perp$, which takes into account precessing\nspin information from both black holes. We show that this adapted effective\nprecession spin (i) mimics the precession dynamics of the fully precessing\nconfiguration remarkably well, (ii) captures the signature features of\nprecession in higher-order modes, and (iii) reproduces the final state of the\nremnant black hole with high accuracy for the overwhelming majority of\nconfigurations. We demonstrate the efficacy of this two-dimensional precession\nspin in the strong-field regime, paving the path for meaningful calibration of\nthe precessing sector of semi-analytic waveform models with a faithful\nrepresentation of higher-order modes through merger and the remnant black hole\nspin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Dec 2020 19:00:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Mar 2021 20:03:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 27 Apr 2021 23:29:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-05"}

In\nparticular, this holds for inner functions with a tight Khrapchenko bound. Our\nrandom projections are tailor-made to the function's structure so that the\nfunction maintains structure even under projection -- using such projections is\nnecessary, as standard random restrictions simplify $\\mathbf{AC}^0$ circuits.\nIn contrast, we show that any De Morgan formula shrinks by a quadratic factor\nunder our random projections, allowing us to prove the cubic lower bound. Our\nproof techniques build on the proof of H\\r{a}stad for the simpler case of\nbalanced formulas. This allows for a significantly simpler proof at the cost of\nslightly worse parameters. As such, when specialized to the case of $p$-random\nrestrictions, our proof can be used as an exposition of H\\r{a}stad's result.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Dec 2020 19:00:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Dec 2020 15:35:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-01"}

The CCS algorithm is a two-point root-finding algorithm specifically\ndesigned for the VOF interface positioning problem, where the volume fraction\nfunction has diminishing derivatives at the ends of the search interval. As a\ntwo-point iterative algorithm, CCS re-uses function values and derivatives from\nprevious iterations and does not rely on interval bracketing. The CCS algorithm\nonly requires only two iterations on average to position the interface with a\ntolerance of $10^{-12}$, even with numerically very challenging volume fraction\nvalues, e.g. near $10^{-9}$ or $1-10^{-9}$.\n  The proposed CCS algorithm is very straightforward to implement because its\ninput is already calculated by every geometrical VOF method. It builds upon and\nsignificantly improves the predictive Newton method and is independent of the\ncell's geometrical model and related intersection algorithm. Geometrical\nparametrizations of truncated volumes used by other contemporary methods are\ncompletely avoided.

Possible uses of this approach include for example\nComputer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems working with medical imaging data, such\nas Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or Computed Tomography (CT) scans. We\ndemonstrate the viability of our method in the domain of medical imaging for\npatient condition diagnosis, as the proposed decision explanation method via\nsimilar ground truth domain examples (e.g. from existing diagnosis archives)\nwill be interpretable by the operating medical personnel. Our results indicate\nthat our method is capable of detecting distinct prediction strategies that\nenable us to identify the most similar predictions from an existing atlas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Dec 2020 20:36:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-07"}

It has been\nknown that the X-ray emission is dominated by the optically thin thermal plasma\nemission, and its flux level varies significantly over the orbital phase. The\nX-ray emission also contains a component that modulates with the beat frequency\nbetween the white dwarf's spin frequency and orbital frequency. In this new\nanalysis, the 2020 data taken by NICER shows that the X-ray emission is\nmodulating with the spin frequency as well as the beat frequency, indicating\nthat part of the X-ray emission is coming from the white dwarf's magnetosphere.\nIt is found that the signal of the spin frequency appears only at a specific\norbital phase, while the beat signal appears over the orbital phase. We\ninterpret the X-ray emission modulating with the spin frequency and the beat\nfrequency as a result of the synchrotron emission from electrons with a smaller\nand larger pitch angle, respectively. In a long-term evolution, the beat pulse\nprofile averaged over the orbital phase changed from a single-peak structure in\n2016/2018 to a double-peak structure in 2020. The observed X-ray flux levels\nmeasured in 2016/2017 are higher than those measured in 2018/2020. The plasma\ntemperature and amplitude of the orbital waveform might vary with time too.\nThese results indicate that the X-ray emission from AR Scorpii evolves on a\ntimescale of years. This long-term evolution would be explained by a\nsuper-orbital modulation related to, for example, a precession of the white\ndwarf, or a fluctuation of the system related to activity of the companion\nstar.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Dec 2020 21:43:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-17"}

The new\nloss functions can supervise the mask training without relying on mask\nannotations. This is made possible with two loss terms, namely, 1) a surrogate\nterm that minimizes the discrepancy between the projections of the ground-truth\nbox and the predicted mask; 2) a pairwise loss that can exploit the prior that\nproximal pixels with similar colors are very likely to have the same category\nlabel. Experiments demonstrate that the redesigned mask loss can yield\nsurprisingly high-quality instance masks with only box annotations. For\nexample, without using any mask annotations, with a ResNet-101 backbone and 3x\ntraining schedule, we achieve 33.2% mask AP on COCO test-dev split (vs. 39.1%\nof the fully supervised counterpart).

The primary\nintention was to leverage off-the-shelf pre-trained NN models as a basis for\nassisting individual performers either as musical novices looking to engage\nwith more experienced performers or as a tool to expand musical possibilities\nthrough new forms of creative expression. The system expands upon a variety of\nideas found in different research areas including new interfaces for musical\nexpression, generative music and group performance to produce a networked\nperformance solution served via a web-browser interface. The final\nimplementation of the system offers performers a mixture of high and low-level\ncontrols to influence the shape of sequences of notes output by locally run NN\nmodels in real time, also allowing performers to define their level of\nengagement with the assisting generative models. Two test performances were\nplayed, with the system shown to feasibly support four performers over a four\nminute piece while producing musically cohesive and engaging music. Iterations\non the design of the system exposed technical constraints on the use of a\nJavaScript environment for generative models in a live music context, largely\nderived from inescapable processing overheads.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Dec 2020 23:11:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-07"}

The solar system giant planets rapidly\nformed during the protoplanetary disk stage and, after t_0, radially migrated\nby interacting with outer disk planetesimals. An early (t<100 Myr) dynamical\ninstability is thought to have occurred with Jupiter having gravitational\nencounters with a planetary-size body, jumping inward by ~0.2-0.5 au, and\nlanding on its current, mildly eccentric orbit. Here we investigate how the\ngiant planet instability affected formation of the terrestrial planets. We\nstudy several instability cases that were previously shown to match many solar\nsystem constraints. We find that resonances with the giant planets help to\nremove solids available for accretion near ~1.5 au, thus stalling the growth of\nMars. It does not matter, however, whether the giant planets are placed on\ntheir current orbits at t_0 or whether they realistically evolve in one of our\ninstability models; the results are practically the same. The tight orbital\nspacing of Venus and Earth is difficult to reproduce in our simulations,\nincluding cases where bodies grow from a narrow annulus at 0.7-1 au, because\nprotoplanets tend to radially spread during accretion. The best results are\nobtained in the narrow-annulus model when protoplanets emerging from the\ndispersing gas nebula are assumed to have (at least) the Mars mass. This\nsuggests efficient accretion of the terrestrial protoplanets during the first\n~10 Myr of the solar system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Dec 2020 23:12:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-13"}

However, unambiguous observational\nconfirmation of the fluctuation dynamo action in a galactic environment is\nstill missing. This is because, in spiral galaxies, it is difficult to\ndifferentiate between small-scale magnetic fields generated by a fluctuation\ndynamo and those due to the tangling of the large-scale field. We propose that\nobservations of magnetic fields in elliptical galaxies would directly probe the\nfluctuation dynamo action. This is motivated by the fact that in ellipticals,\ndue to their lack of significant rotation, the conventional large-scale dynamo\nis absent and the fluctuation dynamo is responsible for controlling the\nmagnetic field strength and structure. By considering turbulence injected by\nType Ia supernova explosions and possible magnetic field amplification by\ncooling flows, we estimate expected magnetic field strengths of $0.2~-~1\n\\,\\mu{\\rm G}$ in quiescent elliptical galaxies.

The Bayesian hierarchical model (BHM)\nprovides an attractive approach to design phase II tissue-agnostic trials by\nallowing information borrowing across multiple disease types. In this article,\nwe elucidate two intrinsic and inevitable issues that may limit the use of BHM\nto tissue-agnostic trials: sensitivity to the prior specification of the\nshrinkage parameter and the competing \"interest\" among disease types in\nincreasing power and controlling type I error. To address these issues, we\npropose the optimal BHM (OBHM) approach. With OBHM, we first specify a flexible\nutility function to quantify the tradeoff between type I error and power across\ndisease type based on the study objectives, and then we select the prior of the\nshrinkage parameter to optimize the utility function of clinical and regulatory\ninterest. OBMH effectively balances type I and II errors, addresses the\nsensitivity of the prior selection, and reduces the \"unwarranted\" subjectivity\nin the prior selection. Simulation study shows that the resulting OBHM and its\nextensions, clustered OBHM (COBHM) and adaptive OBHM (AOBHM), have desirable\noperating characteristics, outperforming some existing methods with better\nbalanced power and type I error control. Our method provides a systematic,\nrigorous way to apply BHM and solve the common problem of blindingly using a\nnon-informative inverse-gamma prior (with a large variance) or priors\narbitrarily chosen that may lead to pathological statistical properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 2020 03:12:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-07"}

Being able to reliably locate the same\nanatomical structure across varying images is a fundamental task in medical\nimage analysis. In principle it is possible to use landmark detection or\nsemantic segmentation for this task, but to work well these require large\nnumbers of labeled data for each anatomical structure and sub-structure of\ninterest. A more universal approach would learn the intrinsic structure from\nunlabeled images. We introduce such an approach, called Self-supervised\nAnatomical eMbedding (SAM). SAM generates semantic embeddings for each image\npixel that describes its anatomical location or body part. To produce such\nembeddings, we propose a pixel-level contrastive learning framework. A\ncoarse-to-fine strategy ensures both global and local anatomical information\nare encoded. Negative sample selection strategies are designed to enhance the\nembedding's discriminability. Using SAM, one can label any point of interest on\na template image and then locate the same body part in other images by simple\nnearest neighbor searching. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SAM in multiple\ntasks with 2D and 3D image modalities. On a chest CT dataset with 19 landmarks,\nSAM outperforms widely-used registration algorithms while only taking 0.23\nseconds for inference. On two X-ray datasets, SAM, with only one labeled\ntemplate image, surpasses supervised methods trained on 50 labeled images.

In order to realize\nscale economies associated with transportation operations both on the outbound\nand inbound sides, dispatch schedules must be synchronized over time with\ninventory replenishment decisions. An immediate delivery policy on the outbound\nside does not make economic sense because outbound dispatch operations and\ncosts will benefit from a temporal shipment consolidation policy. Our\nparticular interest in this setting is the exact modeling and analysis of\nhybrid shipment consolidation policies, in comparison to the time- and\nquantity-based counterparts. Since shipment consolidation prolongs customer\nwaiting and inventory holding, we investigate average delay penalty per order\nand average inventory per time unit as critical measures of performance of the\ndistribution operation, along with the annual cost. By fixing the expected\ninbound replenishment and outbound dispatch frequencies, we compare these\nmeasures among the alternative ways of operation under hybrid, time-based, and\nquantity-based policies. This comparison then lends itself to an explicit\nanalytical comparison of average costs under these three policies, without a\nneed for solving the corresponding optimization problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 2020 04:10:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-07"}

Considering the features\nof the two technologies, LiDAR-SLAM and PPP, this paper proposes a SLAM system,\nnamely P3-LOAM (PPP based LiDAR Odometry and Mapping) which couples LiDAR-SLAM\nand PPP.

We examine the systems with a large Maki parameter so that the orbital\npair-breaking effect is negligible, except for the locking of the direction of\nthe FFLO vector q in the field direction.It is known that the nesting effect\nfor the FFLO state can be strong in QLD systems in which the orbital\npair-breaking effect is suppressed by applying the mag. field parallel to the\nlayers.

For decades, AA Tau exhibited photometric and spectroscopic\nvariability that were successfully modelled as occultations of the primary star\nby circumstellar material. In 2011, AA Tau entered an extended faint state,\npresumably due to enhanced levels of circumstellar dust. We use two sets of\ncontemporaneous optical-NIR spectra of AA Tau, obtained in December of 2008 and\n2014, to directly measure the wavelength-dependent extinction associated with\nthe dust enhancement driving AA Tau's 2011 optical fade. Taken alone, AA Tau's\napparent optical-NIR increased extinction curve cannot be fit well with\nstandard extinction laws. At optical wavelengths, AA Tau's dimming event is\nconsistent with predictions of common extinction models for an increase of\n$A_V=2$, but no such model reproduces AA Tau's color-color excess at NIR\nwavelengths. We show that veiling emission accounts for the apparent anomalous\nNIR extinction: after including this veiling flux, AA Tau's dimming event is\nconsistent with a standard $A_V=2$ extinction law across the full optical-NIR\nrange. We also report an increase in AA Tau's mid-IR flux since its 2011 fade,\nand suggest that an increase in the height of AA Tau's inner disk is the most\nlikely explanation for both the IR brightening and the additional extinction\nalong the line of sight. In addition to informing our understanding of AA Tau,\nthis analysis demonstrates that caution should be exercised when inferring\nextinction (and stellar parameters) from the NIR color-color excess of young\nstars with measurable NIR veiling fluxes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 2020 05:57:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-20"}

The \"large-scale\" notion refers\nto that the decision variable has a large number of values to choose from on\neach dimension. The proposed algorithms are targeted to identify a solution\nthat is close to the optimal solution given any precision level with any given\nprobability. To achieve this target, utilizing the convexity structure, our\nalgorithm design does not need to scan all the choices of the decision\nvariable, but instead sequentially draws a subset of choices of the decision\nvariable and uses them to \"localize\" potentially near-optimal solutions to an\nadaptively shrinking region.\n  To show the power of the localization operation, we first consider\none-dimensional large-scale problems. We propose the shrinking uniform sampling\nalgorithm, which is proved to achieve the target with an optimal expected\nsimulation cost under an asymptotic criterion. For multi-dimensional problems,\nwe combine the idea of localization with subgradient information and propose a\nframework to design stochastic cutting-plane methods and the dimension\nreduction algorithm, whose expected simulation cost have a low dependence on\nthe scale and the dimension of the problems.

However, noises prevail in real-world networks,\nwhich compromise networks to a large extent in that edges in networks propagate\nnoises through the whole network instead of only the node itself. While\nexisting methods tend to focus on preserving structural properties, the\nrobustness of the learned representations against noises is generally ignored.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel framework to learn noise-free node\nrepresentations and eliminate noises simultaneously. Since noises are often\nunknown on real graphs, we design two generators, namely a graph generator and\na noise generator, to identify normal structures and noises in an unsupervised\nsetting. On the one hand, the graph generator serves as a unified scheme to\nincorporate any useful graph prior knowledge to generate normal structures. We\nillustrate the generative process with community structures and power-law\ndegree distributions as examples. On the other hand, the noise generator\ngenerates graph noises not only satisfying some fundamental properties but also\nin an adaptive way. Thus, real noises with arbitrary distributions can be\nhandled successfully. Finally, in order to eliminate noises and obtain\nnoise-free node representations, two generators need to be optimized jointly,\nand through maximum likelihood estimation, we equivalently convert the model\ninto imposing different regularization constraints on the true graph and noises\nrespectively. Our model is evaluated on both real-world and synthetic data. It\noutperforms other strong baselines for node classification and graph\nreconstruction tasks, demonstrating its ability to eliminate graph noises.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 2020 07:18:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-07"}

Therefore, we analyzed the rumor spreading\nmechanism and propose a method to quantify a rumors' influence by the speed of\nnew insiders. The search frequency of the rumor is used as an observation\nvariable of new insiders. The peak coefficient and the attenuation coefficient\nare calculated for the search frequency, which conforms to the exponential\ndistribution. We designed several rumor features and used the above two\ncoefficients as predictable labels. A 5-fold cross-validation experiment using\nthe mean square error (MSE) as the loss function showed that the decision tree\nwas suitable for predicting the peak coefficient, and the linear regression\nmodel was ideal for predicting the attenuation coefficient. Our feature\nanalysis showed that precursor features were the most important for the\noutbreak coefficient, while location information and rumor entity information\nwere the most important for the attenuation coefficient. Meanwhile, features\nthat were conducive to the outbreak were usually harmful to the continued\nspread of rumors.

However,\nin actual computations, this kind of neural network no longer holds any upper\nbound and is therefore susceptible to adversarial examples. Following similar\nprocedures, we explain why adversarial examples can fool other deep neural\nnetworks with skip connections.

We next model the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity\nMapping Experiment FRB survey (CHIME/FRB).

From the outcome of these two methods we thus conclude\nthat all FRBs originate from a single and mostly uniform population of varying\nrepeaters.

Yet, the\nadversarial robustness of such pre-trained graph learning models remains\nlargely unexplored. More importantly, most existing defense techniques designed\nfor end-to-end graph representation learning methods require pre-specified\nlabel definitions, and thus cannot be directly applied to the pre-training\nmethods. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised defense technique to\nrobustify pre-trained deep graph models, so that the perturbations on the input\ngraph can be successfully identified and blocked before the model is applied to\ndifferent downstream tasks. Specifically, we introduce a mutual\ninformation-based measure, \\textit{graph representation vulnerability (GRV)},\nto quantify the robustness of graph encoders on the representation space. We\nthen formulate an optimization problem to learn the graph representation by\ncarefully balancing the trade-off between the expressive power and the\nrobustness (\\emph{i.e.}, GRV) of the graph encoder. The discrete nature of\ngraph topology and the joint space of graph data make the optimization problem\nintractable to solve. To handle the above difficulty and to reduce\ncomputational expense, we further relax the problem and thus provide an\napproximate solution. Additionally, we explore a provable connection between\nthe robustness of the unsupervised graph encoder and that of models on\ndownstream tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that even without access to\nlabels and tasks, our model is still able to enhance robustness against\nadversarial attacks on three downstream tasks (node classification, link\nprediction, and community detection) by an average of +16.5% compared with\nexisting methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 2020 09:29:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 May 2021 13:05:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-31"}

Physiological models often present\ninter-correlated parameters. The inclusion of correlated factors in GSA and the\nsensitivity indices interpretation has proven an issue for these models.

These methods either focus more on the entire\ngraph, or pay more attention to a part of the graph, e.g., paths between the\ntarget entity pair. However, we find that document-level RE may benefit from\nfocusing on both of them simultaneously. Therefore, to obtain more\ncomprehensive entity representations, we propose the Coarse-to-Fine Entity\nRepresentation model (CFER) that adopts a coarse-to-fine strategy involving two\nphases. First, CFER uses graph neural networks to integrate global information\nin the entire graph at a coarse level. Next, CFER utilizes the global\ninformation as a guidance to selectively aggregate path information between the\ntarget entity pair at a fine level.

When\nevaluated on the standard MIRACL-VC1 dataset, the proposed model achieved an\naccuracy of 98.1%, underscoring its effectiveness as an effective and robust\nsystem. The proposed method is also data-efficient since the model gave good\nresults even when trained with only 10 positive video samples. The competence\nof the training of the network is also demonstrated by benchmarking the\nproposed system against various compounded Facial recognition and Lip reading\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 2020 10:46:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 19 Dec 2020 08:52:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-22"}

Our\nmethod is based on Taylor expanding the equations for cosmological fluctuations\nin a small quantity, which parameterizes the duration of the non-slow-roll\neras. The super-horizon spectrum of perturbations is described by few effective\nparameters, and is characterized by a pronounced dip followed by a rapid growth\nin its amplitude, as typically found in numerical and analytical studies.

However, an approach that considers the\nreceiver design from a wider perspective rather than treating it block-by-block\nmay take advantage of the impacts of these blocks on each other and provide\nbetter performance. Herein, we can benefit from machine learning and compose a\nreceiver model implementing supervised learning techniques. With this\nmotivation, we consider a one-to-one transmission system over a flat fast\nfading wireless channel and propose a support vector machines (SVM)-based\nreceiver that combines the pilot-based channel estimation, data demodulation\nand decoding processes in one joint operation. We follow two techniques in the\nreceiver design. We first design one SVM-based classifier that outputs the\nclass of the encoding codeword that enters the encoder at the transmitter side.\nThen, we put forward a model with one SVM-based classifier per one bit in the\nencoding codeword, where each classifier assigns the value of the corresponding\nbit in the encoding vector. With the second technique, we simplify the receiver\ndesign especially for longer encoding codewords. We show that the SVM-based\nreceiver performs very closely to the maximum likelihood decoder, which is\nknown to be the optimal decoding strategy when the encoding vectors at the\ntransmitter are equally likely. We further show that the SVM-based receiver\noutperforms the conventional receivers that perform channel estimation, data\ndemodulation and decoding in blocks. Finally, we show that we can train the\nSVM-based receiver with 1-bit analog-to-digital converter (ADC) outputs and the\nSVM-based receiver can perform very closely to the conventional receivers that\ntake 32-bit ADC outputs as inputs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 2020 11:07:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-07"}

Our robot interacts with objects using an initial action\nrepertoire that is assumed to be acquired earlier and observes the effects it\ncan create in the environment. To form action-grounded object, effect, and\nrelational categories, we employ a binary bottleneck layer in a predictive,\ndeep encoder-decoder network that takes the image of the scene and the action\napplied as input, and generates the resulting effects in the scene in pixel\ncoordinates. After learning, the binary latent vector represents action-driven\nobject categories based on the interaction experience of the robot. To distill\nthe knowledge represented by the neural network into rules useful for symbolic\nreasoning, a decision tree is trained to reproduce its decoder function.\nProbabilistic rules are extracted from the decision paths of the tree and are\nrepresented in the Probabilistic Planning Domain Definition Language (PPDDL),\nallowing off-the-shelf planners to operate on the knowledge extracted from the\nsensorimotor experience of the robot.

By blocking unused functionality, the impact of potential\nexploits can be reduced. While seccomp provides a solution for filtering\nsyscalls, it requires manual implementation of filter rules for each individual\napplication. Recent work has investigated automated approaches for detecting\nand installing the necessary filter rules. However, as we show, these\napproaches make assumptions that are not necessary or require overly\ntime-consuming analysis.\n  In this paper, we propose Chestnut, an automated approach for generating\nstrict syscall filters for Linux userspace applications with lower requirements\nand limitations. Chestnut comprises two phases, with the first phase consisting\nof two static components, i.e., a compiler and a binary analyzer, that extract\nthe used syscalls during compilation or in an analysis of the binary. The\ncompiler-based approach of Chestnut is up to factor 73 faster than previous\napproaches without affecting the accuracy adversely. On the binary analysis\nlevel, we demonstrate that the requirement of position-independent binaries of\nrelated work is not needed, enlarging the set of applications for which\nChestnut is usable. In an optional second phase, Chestnut provides a dynamic\nrefinement tool that allows restricting the set of allowed syscalls further. We\ndemonstrate that Chestnut on average blocks 302 syscalls (86.5%) via the\ncompiler and 288 (82.5%) using the binary-level analysis on a set of 18 widely\nused applications. We found that Chestnut blocks the dangerous exec syscall in\n50% and 77.7% of the tested applications using the compiler- and binary-based\napproach, respectively. For the tested applications, Chestnut prevents\nexploitation of more than 62% of the 175 CVEs that target the kernel via\nsyscalls.

Moreover, the limit gradient system can be equivalently\ndescribed by a coarse-grained gradient system, which induces a diffusion\nequation with a mixed diffusion constant for the coarse-grained slow variable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 2020 13:08:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-07"}

To counter the COVID-19 infodemic, the\nTrollHunter leverages a unique linguistic analysis of a multi-dimensional set\nof Twitter content features to detect whether or not a tweet was meant to\ntroll.

We present an in-depth\nanalysis of the spatio-temporal demand and supply, level of service, and origin\nand destination patterns of Belleville ODT users, based on the data collected\nfrom September 2018 till May 2019. The independent and combined effects of the\ndemographic characteristics (population density, working-age, and median\nincome) on the ODT trip production and attraction levels were studied using GIS\nand the K-means machine learning clustering algorithm. The results indicate\nthat ODT trips demand is highest for 11:00 pm-11:45 pm during the weekdays and\n8:00 pm-8:30 pm during the weekends. We expect this to be the result of users\nreturning home from work or shopping. Results showed that 39% of the trips were\nfound to have a waiting time of smaller than 15 minutes, while 28% of trips had\na waiting time of 15-30 minutes. The dissemination areas with higher population\ndensity, lower median income, or higher working-age percentages tend to have\nhigher ODT trip attraction levels, except for the dissemination areas that have\nhighly attractive places like commercial areas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 2020 13:56:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Feb 2022 01:48:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-23"}

The shallow water equations\n(SWEs) are commonly used for prediction of the flow velocities. However,\naccurate and fast prediction with standard SWE solvers is challenging in many\ncases. Traditional approaches are computationally expensive and require\nhigh-resolution riverbed profile measurement ( bathymetry) for accurate\npredictions. As a result, they are a poor fit in situations where they need to\nbe evaluated repetitively due, for example, to varying boundary condition (BC),\nor when the bathymetry is not known with certainty. In this work, we propose a\ntwo-stage process that tackles these issues. First, using the principal\ncomponent geostatistical approach (PCGA) we estimate the probability density\nfunction of the bathymetry from flow velocity measurements, and then we use\nmultiple machine learning algorithms to obtain a fast solver of the SWEs, given\naugmented realizations from the posterior bathymetry distribution and the\nprescribed range of BCs. The first step allows us to predict flow velocities\nwithout direct measurement of the bathymetry. Furthermore, the augmentation of\nthe distribution in the second stage allows incorporation of the additional\nbathymetry information into the flow velocity prediction for improved accuracy\nand generalization, even if the bathymetry changes over time. Here, we use\nthree solvers, referred to as PCA-DNN (principal component analysis-deep neural\nnetwork), SE (supervised encoder), and SVE (supervised variational encoder),\nand validate them on a reach of the Savannah river near Augusta, GA. Our\nresults show that the fast solvers are capable of predicting flow velocities\nwith good accuracy, at a computational cost that is significantly lower than\nthe cost of solving the full boundary value problem with traditional methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 2020 14:26:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-07"}

In this study, we explore the\nusage of a new modality of dataset, online food delivery data, to detect job\nand housing mobility. By leveraging millions of meal orders from a popular\nonline food ordering and delivery service in Beijing, China, we are able to\ndetect job and housing moves at much higher spatial and temporal resolutions\nthan using traditional data sources. Popular moving seasons and\norigins/destinations can be well identified. More importantly, we match the\ndetected moves to both macro- and micro-level factors so as to characterize job\nand housing dynamics. Our findings suggest that commuting distance is a major\nfactor for job and housing mobility. We also observe that: (1) For home movers,\nthere is a trade-off between lower housing cost and shorter commuting distance\ngiven the urban spatial structure; (2) For job hoppers, those who frequently\nwork overtime are more likely to reduce their working hours by switching jobs.\nWhile this new modality of dataset has its limitations, we believe that\nensemble approaches would be promising, where a mash-up of multiple datasets\nwith different characteristic limitations can provide a more comprehensive\npicture of job and housing dynamics. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness of\nutilizing food delivery data to detect and analyze job and housing mobility,\nand contributes to realizing the full potential of ensemble-based approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 2020 02:48:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-08"}

Furthermore, neural models timed by\nspiking neurons operate below the rate necessary to overcome processing error.\nUsing retinal processing as our example, we demonstrate that the contemporary\ntheory of nerve conduction based on cable theory is inappropriate to account\nfor the short computational time necessary for the full functioning of the\nretina and by implication the rest of the brain.

In this paper, we propose an online approach to handle missing\nvalues while a classification model is learnt. To reach this goal, we develop a\nmulti-objective optimization model with two objective functions for imputation\nand model selection. We also propose three formulations for imputation\nobjective function. We use an evolutionary algorithm based on NSGA II to find\nthe optimal solutions as the Pareto solutions. We investigate the reliability\nand robustness of the proposed model using experiments by defining several\nscenarios in dealing with missing values and classification. We also describe\nhow the proposed model can contribute to medical informatics. We compare the\nperformance of three different formulations via experimental results. The\nproposed model results get validated by comparing with a comparable literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 2020 03:44:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-25"}

This has motivated the use of fully connected\nartificial neural networks to predict stiff chemical source terms as functions\nof the thermochemical state of the combustion system. However, due to the\nnonlinearities and multi-scale nature of combustion, the predicted solution\noften diverges from the true solution when these deep learning models are\ncoupled with a computational fluid dynamics solver. This is because these\napproaches minimize the error during training without guaranteeing successful\nintegration with ordinary differential equation solvers. In the present work, a\nnovel neural ordinary differential equations approach to modeling chemical\nkinetics, termed as ChemNODE, is developed. In this deep learning framework,\nthe chemical source terms predicted by the neural networks are integrated\nduring training, and by computing the required derivatives, the neural network\nweights are adjusted accordingly to minimize the difference between the\npredicted and ground-truth solution. A proof-of-concept study is performed with\nChemNODE for homogeneous autoignition of hydrogen-air mixture over a range of\ncomposition and thermodynamic conditions. It is shown that ChemNODE accurately\ncaptures the correct physical behavior and reproduces the results obtained\nusing the full chemical kinetic mechanism at a fraction of the computational\ncost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 3 Dec 2020 23:49:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2021 20:18:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 7 Oct 2021 21:17:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-11"}
