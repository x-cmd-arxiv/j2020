In particular, it can be\napplied to derive quantitative bounds on the expected suprema and the degree of\ncontinuity of sample paths for many processes.\n  One of the crowning achievements of the theory is Talagrand's tight\nalternative characterization of the suprema of Gaussian processes in terms of\nmajorizing measures. The proof of this theorem was difficult, and thus\nconsiderable effort was put into the task of developing both shorter and easier\nto understand proofs. A major reason for this difficulty was considered to be\ntheory of majorizing measures itself, which had the reputation of being opaque\nand mysterious. As a consequence, most recent treatments of the theory\n(including by Talagrand himself) have eschewed the use of majorizing measures\nin favor of a purely combinatorial approach (the generic chaining) where\nobjects based on sequences of partitions provide roughly matching upper and\nlower bounds on the desired expected supremum.\n  In this paper, we return to majorizing measures as a primary object of study,\nand give a viewpoint that we think is natural and clarifying from an\noptimization perspective. As our main contribution, we give an algorithmic\nproof of the majorizing measures theorem based on two parts: (1) We make the\nsimple (but apparently new) observation that finding the best majorizing\nmeasure can be cast as a convex program. This also allows for efficiently\ncomputing the measure using off-the-shelf methods from convex optimization.

In this study, we investigate static output feedback controllers for\nreducing transient energy growth of flow perturbations within linear and\nnonlinear simulations of a sub-critical channel flow. A static output feedback\nlinear quadratic regulator~(SOF-LQR) is designed to reduce the worst-case\ntransient energy growth due to flow perturbations. The controller directly uses\nwall-based measurements to optimally regulate the flow with wall-normal blowing\nand suction from the upper and lower channel walls.

Oftentimes, both\nthe portfolio and the algorithm selector are chosen using a training set of\ntypical problem instances from the application domain at hand.

Given the high\ndimensions of control space, this problem is particularly challenging for\nmulti-legged robots walking in complex and unknown environments. Existing\nliteratures often regard the gait generation as an optimization problem and\nsolve the gait optimization from scratch for robots walking in a specific\nenvironment. However, such approaches do not consider the use of pre-acquired\nknowledge which can be useful in improving the quality and speed of motion\ngeneration in complex environments. To address the issue, this paper proposes a\ntransfer learning-based evolutionary framework for multi-objective gait\noptimization, named Tr-GO. The idea is to initialize a high-quality population\nby using the technique of transfer learning, so any kind of population-based\noptimization algorithms can be seamlessly integrated into this framework. The\nadvantage is that the generated gait can not only dynamically adapt to\ndifferent environments and tasks, but also simultaneously satisfy multiple\ndesign specifications (e.g., speed, stability). The experimental results show\nthe effectiveness of the proposed framework for the gait optimization problem\nbased on three multi-objective evolutionary algorithms: NSGA-II, RM-MEDA and\nMOPSO. When transferring the pre-acquired knowledge from the plain terrain to\nvarious inclined and rugged ones, the proposed Tr-GO framework accelerates the\nevolution process by a minimum of 3-4 times compared with non-transferred\nscenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Dec 2020 16:41:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-25"}

Recent advances in CNNs\nare producing outstanding results in super-resolution and contrast synthesis of\nMRI.

Here we study the\ngeneralizability of optimal control, namely, optimal controls that can be\nsystematically updated across a range of parameters with minimal cost. In cases\nwhere control channels can completely reverse the shift in the Hamiltonian due\nto a change in parameters, we provide an analytical method which efficiently\ngenerates optimal controls for any parameter starting from an initial optimal\ncontrol found by either GRAPE or reinforcement learning. When the control\nchannels are restricted, the analytical scheme is invalid, but reinforcement\nlearning still retains a level of generalizability, albeit in a narrower range.\nIn cases where the shift in the Hamiltonian is impossible to decompose to\navailable control channels, no generalizability is found for either the\nreinforcement learning or the analytical scheme.

This paper provides a\nsystematic review on principles and methods in spatial and spatiotemporal\nprediction. We provide a taxonomy of methods categorized by the key challenge\nthey address. For each method, we introduce its underlying assumption,\ntheoretical foundation, and discuss its advantages and disadvantages. Our goal\nis to help interdisciplinary domain scientists choose techniques to solve their\nproblems, and more importantly, to help data mining researchers to understand\nthe main principles and methods in spatial and spatiotemporal prediction and\nidentify future research opportunities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Dec 2020 18:17:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-25"}

They are\nbased on partitions of the computational domain by polygonal/polyhedral\nsubregions, where the shape functions approximate local Dirichlet problems with\npiecewise polynomial trace data. Using this operator adaptation approach, and\nby imposing a starlike scaling requirement on the subregions, the\nrepresentation of local SBFEM shape functions in radial and surface directions\nare obtained from eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of an ODE system, whose\ncoefficients are determined by the element geometry and the trace polynomial\nspaces. The aim of this paper is to derive a priori error estimates for SBFEM's\nsolutions of harmonic test problems. For that, the SBFEM spaces are\ncharacterized in the context of Duffy's approximations for which a\ngradient-orthogonality constraint is imposed. As a consequence, the scaled\nboundary functions are gradient-orthogonal to any function in Duffy's spaces\nvanishing at the mesh skeleton, a mimetic version of a well-known property\nvalid for harmonic functions. This orthogonality property is applied to provide\na priori SBFEM error estimates in terms of known finite element interpolant\nerrors of the exact solution. Similarities with virtual harmonic approximations\nare also explored for the understanding of SBFEM convergence properties.\nNumerical experiments with 2D and 3D polytopal meshes confirm optimal SBFEM\nconvergence rates for two test problems with smooth solutions. Attention is\nalso paid to the approximation of a point singular solution by using SBFEM\nclose to the singularity and finite element approximations elsewhere, revealing\noptimal accuracy rates of standard regular contexts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Dec 2020 19:02:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-07"}

DNNs tend to essentially fit on clean\nsamples at a higher rate in the initial stages, and later fit on the noisy\nsamples at a relatively lower rate. Thus, with a noisy dataset, the test\naccuracy increases initially and drops in the later stages. To find an early\nstopping point at the maximum obtainable test accuracy (MOTA), recent studies\nassume either that i) a clean validation set is available or ii) the noise\nratio is known, or, both. However, often a clean validation set is unavailable,\nand the noise estimation can be inaccurate. To overcome these issues, we\nprovide a novel training solution, free of these conditions. We analyze the\nrate of change of the training accuracy for different noise ratios under\ndifferent conditions to identify a training stop region.

ThamizhiPOSt is our POS tagger, which is based on the\nStanza, trained with Amrita POS-tagged corpus. It is the current\nstate-of-the-art in Tamil POS tagging with an F1 score of 93.27. Our\nmorphological analyzer, ThamizhiMorph is a rule-based system with a very good\ncoverage of Tamil. Our dependency parser ThamizhiUDp was trained using\nmultilingual data. It shows a Labelled Assigned Score (LAS) of 62.39, 4 points\nhigher than the current best achieved for Tamil dependency parsing.

In this manuscript, we have\ndeveloped two models to study and quantify the extra tensile pressure. In the\nfirst approach, we proposed a strain energy based random fiber network (RFN)\nfailure criteria in which interaction between the cavitating bubble and RFN is\nconsidered. Gelatin samples are prepared for different concentrations, and SEM\nimages are used to study the microstructural properties of the RFN. A unit-cell\nmodel is introduced to evaluate the geometrical and mechanical properties of\nthe RFN. The network strain energy formulation is then coupled with the bubble\ngrowth, and the critical condition is set as the fibers ultimate failure\nstrain. We considered soft materials as homogeneous hyper-elastic Ogden\nmaterial, and fracture-based failure criteria are proposed in the second\napproach. The critical energy release rate is considered for quantifying the\nextra tensile pressure. Both the models are then compared with the existing\ncavitation onset criteria of rubber like materials. The validation is done with\nthe experimental results of threshold tensile pressure for different gelatin\nconcentrations. We have found that due to the large distribution of the pore\nsize in the network, the nucleation pressure is similar to water. Both models\ncan moderately predict the extra tensile pressure within the intermediate range\nof gelatin concentrations. For low concentration, the network's non-affinity\nplays a significant role and must be incorporated. On the other hand, for\nhigher concentrations, the entropic deformation dominates, and strain energy\nformulation is not adequate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Dec 2020 21:22:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-28"}

In this\npaper, we propose to solve multi-task problems through learning structured\npolicies from human demonstrations. Our structured policy is inspired by\nRMPflow, a framework for combining subtask policies on different spaces. The\npolicy structure provides the user an interface to 1) specifying the spaces\nthat are directly relevant to the completion of the tasks, and 2) designing\npolicies for certain tasks that do not need to be learned. We derive an\nend-to-end learning objective function that is suitable for the multi-task\nproblem, emphasizing the deviation of motions on task spaces. Furthermore, the\nmotion generated from the learned policy class is guaranteed to be stable. We\nvalidate the effectiveness of our proposed learning framework through\nqualitative and quantitative evaluations on three robotic tasks on a 7-DOF\nRethink Sawyer robot.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Dec 2020 22:46:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 2021 19:09:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-12"}

Moreover, current stochastic programming models do not allow\nfor uncertainty data to be updated as more accurate information becomes\navailable. This work proposes two decision-making frameworks for a wind energy\ngenerator participating in day-ahead, intraday, reserve, and balancing markets.\nThe first framework is a two-stage stochastic convex optimization approach,\nwhere both scenario-independent and scenario-dependent decisions are made\nconcurrently. The second framework is a series of four two-stage stochastic\noptimization models wherein the results from each model feed into each\nsubsequent model allowing for scenarios to be updated as more information\nbecomes available to the decision-maker. In the simulation experiments, the\nmulti-phase framework performs better than the single-phase in every run, and\nresults in an average profit increase of 7%. The proposed optimization\nframeworks aid in better decision-making while addressing uncertainty related\nto variable resource generators and maximize the return on investment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 24 Dec 2020 22:59:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 6 Mar 2021 05:12:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-09"}

We first provide a review of current\ncontrastive learning literature, then provide an illustrative example where we\nshow that contrastive learning using evolutionary augmentation can be used as a\nrepresentation learning objective which maximizes the mutual information\nbetween biological sequences and their conserved function, and finally outline\nrationale for this approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Dec 2020 01:35:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-29"}

Many existing studies\non arterial traffic prediction only consider temporal measurements of flow and\noccupancy from loop sensors and neglect the rich spatial relationships between\nupstream and downstream detectors. As a result, they often suffer large\nprediction errors, especially for long horizons. We fill this gap by enhancing\na deep learning approach, Diffusion Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network,\nwith spatial information generated from signal timing plans at targeted\nintersections.

Through a dimension\nreduction approach, we can characterize a $d$-dimensional ($d$D)\ninteger-invariant topological phase with lower-dimensional topological number\nquantified by high-order topological charges, of which the $s$th-order\ntopological charges denote the monopoles confined on the $(s-1)$th-order band\ninversion surfaces (BISs) that are $(d-s+1)$D momentum subspaces. The bulk\ntopology is determined by the $s$th order topological charges enclosed by the\n$s$th-order BISs. By quenching the system from trivial phase to topological\nregime, we show that the bulk topology of post-quench Hamiltonian can be\ndetected through a high-order dynamical bulk-surface correspondence, in which\nboth the high-order topological charges and high-order BISs are identified from\nquench dynamics. This characterization theory has essential advantages in two\naspects. First, the highest ($d$th) order topological charges are characterized\nby only discrete signs of spin-polarization in zero dimension (i.e. the $0$th\nChern numbers), whose measurement is much easier than the $1$st-order\ntopological charges that are characterized by the continuous charge-related\nspin texture in higher dimensional space. Secondly, a more striking result is\nthat a first-order high integer-valued topological charge always reduces to\nmultiple highest-order topological charges with unit charge value, and the\nlatter can be readily detected in experiment. The two fundamental features\ngreatly simplify the characterization and detection of the topological charges\nand also topological phases, which shall advance the experimental studies in\nthe near future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Dec 2020 02:51:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-26"}

In order to effectively utilize IRS to achieve promising\nbeamforming gains, the problem of channel state information (CSI) acquisition\nneeds to be carefully considered. However, most recent works assume to employ\nan ideal IRS, i.e., each reflecting element has constant amplitude, variable\nphase shifts, as well as the same response for the signals with different\nfrequencies, which will cause severe estimation error due to the mismatch\nbetween the ideal IRS and the practical one. In this paper, we study channel\nestimation in practical IRS-aided orthogonal frequency division multiplexing\n(OFDM) systems with discrete phase shifts. Different from the prior works which\nassume that IRS has an ideal reflection model, we perform channel estimation by\nconsidering amplitude-phase shift-frequency relationship for the response of\npractical IRS. Aiming at minimizing normalized-mean-square-error (NMSE) of the\nestimated channel, a novel IRS time-varying reflection pattern is designed by\nleveraging the alternating optimization (AO) algorithm for the case of using\nlow-resolution phase shifters. Moreover, for the high-resolution IRS cases, we\nprovide another practical reflection pattern scheme to further reduce the\ncomplexity.

Since the established techniques of\nchopping and nodding need to be modified for observations with the future\nmid-infrared ELT imager and spectrograph (METIS), we investigate the sources of\nthermal background subtraction residuals. Our aim is to either remove or at\nleast minimise the need for nodding in order to increase the observing\nefficiency for METIS. To this end we need to improve our knowledge about the\norigin of chop residuals and devise observing methods to remove them most\nefficiently, i.e. with the slowest possible nodding frequency. Thanks to\ndedicated observations with VLT/VISIR and GranTeCan/CanariCam, we have\nsuccessfully traced the origin of three kinds of chopping residuals to (1) the\nentrance window, (2) the spiders and (3) other warm emitters in the pupil, in\nparticular the VLT M3 mirror cell in its parking position. We conclude that, in\norder to keep chopping residuals stable over a long time (and therefore allow\nfor slower nodding cycles), the pupil illumination needs to be kept constant,\ni.e. (imaging) observations should be performed in pupil-stabilised, rather\nthan field-stabilised mode, with image de-rotation in the post-processing\npipeline. This is now foreseen as the default observing concept for all METIS\nimaging modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Dec 2020 06:35:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-19"}

Many research works of question and answering (Q and A)\nsystem attempt to assist search engines by providing simple, accurate and\nunderstandable answers. However, without original semantic contexts, these\nanswers lack explainability, making them difficult for users to trust and\nadopt. In this paper, a brain-inspired search engine assistant named\nDeveloperBot based on knowledge graph is proposed, which aligns to the\ncognitive process of human and has the capacity to answer complex queries with\nexplainability. Specifically, DeveloperBot firstly constructs a multi-layer\nquery graph by splitting a complex multi-constraint query into several ordered\nconstraints. Then it models the constraint reasoning process as subgraph search\nprocess inspired by the spreading activation model of cognitive science. In the\nend, novel features of the subgraph will be extracted for decision-making. The\ncorresponding reasoning subgraph and answer confidence will be derived as\nexplanations. The results of the decision-making demonstrate that DeveloperBot\ncan estimate the answers and answer confidences with high accuracy.

However, current UCMH\nmethods calculate the similarity between two data, mainly relying on the two\ndata's cross-modal features. These methods suffer from inaccurate similarity\nproblems that result in a suboptimal retrieval Hamming space, because the\ncross-modal features between the data are not sufficient to describe the\ncomplex data relationships, such as situations where two data have different\nfeature representations but share the inherent concepts. In this paper, we\ndevise a deep graph-neighbor coherence preserving network (DGCPN).\nSpecifically, DGCPN stems from graph models and explores graph-neighbor\ncoherence by consolidating the information between data and their neighbors.\nDGCPN regulates comprehensive similarity preserving losses by exploiting three\ntypes of data similarities (i.e., the graph-neighbor coherence, the coexistent\nsimilarity, and the intra- and inter-modality consistency) and designs a\nhalf-real and half-binary optimization strategy to reduce the quantization\nerrors during hashing. Essentially, DGCPN addresses the inaccurate similarity\nproblem by exploring and exploiting the data's intrinsic relationships in a\ngraph. We conduct extensive experiments on three public UCMH datasets. The\nexperimental results demonstrate the superiority of DGCPN, e.g., by improving\nthe mean average precision from 0.722 to 0.751 on MIRFlickr-25K using 64-bit\nhashing codes to retrieve texts from images.

Assuming first an axisymmetric evolution, equilibrium\nconfigurations of the bubble pair are determined as a function of the\nbuoyancy-to-viscous and buoyancy-to-capillary force ratios which define the\nGalilei ($Ga$) and Bond ($Bo$) numbers of the system, respectively. The\nthree-dimensional solutions reveal that this axisymmetric equilibrium is\nactually never reached.

A\npotential real-world application would greatly benefit from a more accurate,\ncompact, and computationally efficient subject-independent BCI. In this work,\nwe propose a novel subject-independent BCI framework, named CCSPNet\n(Convolutional Common Spatial Pattern Network) that is trained on the motor\nimagery (MI) paradigm of a large-scale electroencephalography (EEG) signals\ndatabase consisting of 400 trials for every 54 subjects who perform two-class\nhand-movement MI tasks. The proposed framework applies a wavelet kernel\nconvolutional neural network (WKCNN) and a temporal convolutional neural\nnetwork (TCNN) in order to represent and extract the spectral features of EEG\nsignals. A common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm is implemented for spatial\nfeature extraction, and the number of CSP features is reduced by a dense neural\nnetwork. Finally, the class label is determined by a linear discriminant\nanalysis (LDA) classifier. The CCSPNet evaluation results show that it is\npossible to have a compact BCI that achieves both SD and SI state-of-the-art\nperformance comparable to complex and computationally expensive models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Dec 2020 12:00:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 2 Jan 2021 11:07:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 10 Apr 2021 19:10:36 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 2021 08:12:12 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 12 Sep 2021 15:35:16 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Mon, 27 Dec 2021 23:44:06 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Sat, 8 Oct 2022 13:11:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-11"}

State-of-the-art\nmethods in this direction usually cast the problem as to learn a personalized\nranking on a set of items (e.g., webpages, products). The top-N results are\nthen provided to users as recommendations, where the N is usually a fixed\nnumber pre-defined by the system according to some heuristic criteria (e.g.,\npage size, screen size). There is one major assumption underlying this\nfixed-number recommendation scheme, i.e., there are always sufficient relevant\nitems to users' preferences. Unfortunately, this assumption may not always hold\nin real-world scenarios. In some applications, there might be very limited\ncandidate items to recommend, and some users may have very high relevance\nrequirement in recommendation. In this way, even the top-1 ranked item may not\nbe relevant to a user's preference. Therefore, we argue that it is critical to\nprovide a dynamic-K recommendation, where the K should be different with\nrespect to the candidate item set and the target user. We formulate this\ndynamic-K recommendation task as a joint learning problem with both ranking and\nclassification objectives. The ranking objective is the same as existing\nmethods, i.e., to create a ranking list of items according to users' interests.\nThe classification objective is unique in this work, which aims to learn a\npersonalized decision boundary to differentiate the relevant items from\nirrelevant items. Based on these ideas, we extend two state-of-the-art\nranking-based recommendation methods, i.e., BPRMF and HRM, to the corresponding\ndynamic-K versions, namely DK-BPRMF and DK-HRM. Our experimental results on two\ndatasets show that the dynamic-K models are more effective than the original\nfixed-N recommendation methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Dec 2020 13:02:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-29"}

In\nthis paper, we therefore present an optimization-based velocity planner,\nmathematically formulated as a multi-parametric Sequential Quadratic Problem\n(mpSQP). This planner can handle a spatially and temporally varying friction\ncoefficient, and transfer a race Energy Strategy (ES) to the road. It further\nhandles the velocity-profile-generation task for performance and emergency\ntrajectories in real time on the vehicle's Electronic Control Unit (ECU).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Dec 2020 14:40:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-29"}

On the other hand, a\nscalar abundance can be exponentially suppressed in the adiabatic suppression\nmechanism, where a scalar field moves adiabatically by a time-dependent\ntrapping potential. In this study, we investigate such a trapping effect on the\nabundance of scalar fields.

Unlike the blood\nor lymphatic vessels, these ISF flow pathways are composed of highly ordered\nand topologically connected interstitial fibrous connective tissues that may\nwork as guiderails for the ISF to flow actively over long distance under\ncertain driving forces.

Neural networks are formed by interconnected systems of\nneurons, and are of two types, namely, the Artificial Neural Network (ANNs) and\nBiological Neural Network (interconnected nerve cells). The ANNs are\ncomputationally influenced by human neurons and are used in modelling neural\nsystems. The reasoning foundations of ANNs have been useful in anomaly\ndetection, in areas of medicine such as instant physician, electronic noses,\npattern recognition, and modelling biological systems. Advancing research in\nartificial intelligence using the architecture of the human brain seeks to\nmodel systems by studying the brain rather than looking to technology for brain\nmodels. This study explores the concept of ANNs as a simulator of the\nbiological neuron, and its area of applications. It also explores why\nbrain-like intelligence is needed and how it differs from computational\nframework by comparing neural networks to contemporary computers and their\nmodern day implementation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Dec 2020 05:56:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-22"}

Later in the\ncourse, this view seems to be contradicted by the mysterious density matrix,\nwhich introduces a new set of probabilities in addition to those that are built\ninto the wave function. This paper brings attention to the fact that the\ndensity matrix can be reconciled with the underlying quantum-mechanical\ndescription using a two-particle entangled state with a one-particle subsystem\nas the simplest illustration of the basic principle. The extra-quantum\nprobabilities are traced to the coefficients of superposition of the quantum\nstate vector and the seemingly irreversible exponential population decay is\nshown to be compatible with the unitary time evolution of a pure state when the\ntwo particles interact. The two-particle universe thus provides the student\nwith a tool for understanding how the density operator, with all its richness,\nemerges from quantum mechanics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 25 Dec 2020 00:24:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-16"}
