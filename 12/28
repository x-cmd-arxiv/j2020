A good understanding of these processes is of paramount\nimportance for precision Higgs physics, as well as for searches for new\nphysics. In particular, associated production of $\\gamma$, $W$ or $Z$ bosons\nwith light-flavor and heavy-flavor jets is a powerful tool for testing\nperturbative QCD calculations, Monte Carlo event generators, and can also\nconstrain the parametrizations used to describe the parton content of the\nproton. Furthermore, events with a $W$ or $Z$ boson produced with two\nwell-separated jets can be used to distinguish between electroweak and strong\nproduction mechanisms, and to set limits on contributions of physics beyond the\nStandard Model. This review summarises the historical theoretical developments\nand the state-of-the-art in the modeling of vector-boson-plus-jet physics,\nwhile focusing on experimental results by LHC collaborations in Run-1 and\nRun-2, and including comparisons with recent measurements at the Tevatron.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Dec 2020 16:00:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-06"}

Medical misinformation, such as antivaccine content\npropagating through social media, is associated with increases in vaccine delay\nand refusal. Our overall goal is to develop an automatic detector for\nantivaccine messages to counteract the negative impact that antivaccine\nmessages have on the public health. Very few extant detection systems have\nconsidered multimodality of social media posts (images, texts, and hashtags),\nand instead focus on textual components, despite the rapid growth of\nphoto-sharing applications (e.g., Instagram). As a result, existing systems are\nnot sufficient for detecting antivaccine messages with heavy visual components\n(e.g., images) posted on these newer platforms. To solve this problem, we\npropose a deep learning network that leverages both visual and textual\ninformation. A new semantic- and task-level attention mechanism was created to\nhelp our model to focus on the essential contents of a post that signal\nantivaccine messages. The proposed model, which consists of three branches, can\ngenerate comprehensive fused features for predictions. Moreover, an ensemble\nmethod is proposed to further improve the final prediction accuracy. To\nevaluate the proposed model's performance, a real-world social media dataset\nthat consists of more than 30,000 samples was collected from Instagram between\nJanuary 2016 and October 2019. Our 30 experiment results demonstrate that the\nfinal network achieves above 97% testing accuracy and outperforms other\nrelevant models, demonstrating that it can detect a large amount of antivaccine\nmessages posted daily.

While most earlier work focused on\napplying unsupervised learning upon engineered features, most recent work has\nstarted to resolve this challenge by applying deep learning methodology to\nabstraction of discrete event entries. Inspired by natural language processing,\nLSTM-based anomaly detection models were proposed. They try to predict upcoming\nevents, and raise an anomaly alert when a prediction fails to meet a certain\ncriterion. However, such a predict-next-event methodology has a fundamental\nlimitation: event predictions may not be able to fully exploit the distinctive\ncharacteristics of sequences. This limitation leads to high false positives\n(FPs) and high false negatives (FNs). It is also critical to examine the\nstructure of sequences and the bi-directional causality among individual\nevents. To this end, we propose a new methodology: Recomposing event sequences\nas anomaly detection. We propose DabLog, a Deep Autoencoder-Based anomaly\ndetection method for discrete event Logs. The fundamental difference is that,\nrather than predicting upcoming events, our approach determines whether a\nsequence is normal or abnormal by analyzing (encoding) and reconstructing\n(decoding) the given sequence.

However, malicious clients can still corrupt the global\nmodels in these methods via sending carefully crafted local model updates to\nthe service provider. The fundamental reason is that there is no root of trust\nin existing federated learning methods.\n  In this work, we bridge the gap via proposing FLTrust, a new federated\nlearning method in which the service provider itself bootstraps trust. In\nparticular, the service provider itself collects a clean small training dataset\n(called root dataset) for the learning task and the service provider maintains\na model (called server model) based on it to bootstrap trust. In each\niteration, the service provider first assigns a trust score to each local model\nupdate from the clients, where a local model update has a lower trust score if\nits direction deviates more from the direction of the server model update.\nThen, the service provider normalizes the magnitudes of the local model updates\nsuch that they lie in the same hyper-sphere as the server model update in the\nvector space. Our normalization limits the impact of malicious local model\nupdates with large magnitudes. Finally, the service provider computes the\naverage of the normalized local model updates weighted by their trust scores as\na global model update, which is used to update the global model.

Previous neural solvers of math\nword problems directly translate problem texts into equations, lacking an\nexplicit interpretation of the situations, and often fail to handle more\nsophisticated situations. To address such limits of neural solvers, we\nintroduce the concept of a \\emph{situation model}, which originates from\npsychology studies to represent the mental states of humans in problem-solving,\nand propose \\emph{SMART}, which adopts attributed grammar as the representation\nof situation models for algebra story problems.

Experimental results on ASP6.6k show\nthat the proposed model outperforms all previous neural solvers by a large\nmargin while preserving much better interpretability.

This includes the commonly used flat, constant Hubble\nand synchronous gauges but excludes the comoving slicing gauge.

The newly designed BnB routines are\ncomputationally more attractive than the standard one and also directly\napplicable to solve SASP for linear systems. In contrast with contemporary\napproaches from the literature, our approach is suitable for finding the\noptimal SA combination for stable/unstable NDS that ensures stabilization of\nestimation error and closed-loop dynamics through a simple linear feedback\ncontrol policy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Dec 2020 22:07:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 May 2021 12:31:00 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 4 May 2022 16:49:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-05"}

The teacher network is supposed to be a trustworthy\npredictor and the student tries to mimic its predictions. Usually, a student\nwith a lighter architecture is selected so we can achieve compression and yet\ndeliver high-quality results. In such a setting, distillation only happens for\nfinal predictions whereas the student could also benefit from teacher's\nsupervision for internal components.\n  Motivated by this, we studied the problem of distillation for intermediate\nlayers. Since there might not be a one-to-one alignment between student and\nteacher layers, existing techniques skip some teacher layers and only distill\nfrom a subset of them. This shortcoming directly impacts quality, so we instead\npropose a combinatorial technique which relies on attention. Our model fuses\nteacher-side information and takes each layer's significance into\nconsideration, then performs distillation between combined teacher layers and\nthose of the student. Using our technique, we distilled a 12-layer BERT (Devlin\net al. 2019) into 6-, 4-, and 2-layer counterparts and evaluated them on GLUE\ntasks (Wang et al. 2018).

Each approach comes with its own challenges. There is geometric\ninformation that free resolutions fail to encode, while vector bundle\nresolutions can resist study using algebraic and combinatorial techniques.\nRecently, Berkesch, Erman, and Smith introduced virtual resolutions, which\ncapture desirable geometric information and are also amenable to algebraic and\ncombinatorial study. The theory of virtual resolutions includes a notion of a\nvirtually Cohen--Macaulay property, though tools for assessing which modules\nare virtually Cohen--Macaulay have only recently started to be developed.\n  In this paper, we continue this research program in two related ways. The\nfirst is that, when $X$ is a product of projective spaces, we produce a large\nnew class of virtually Cohen--Macaulay Stanley--Reisner rings, which we show to\nbe virtually Cohen--Macaulay via explicit constructions of appropriate virtual\nresolutions reflecting the underlying combinatorial structure. The second is\nthat, for an arbitrary smooth projective toric variety $X$, we develop\nhomological tools for assessing the virtual Cohen--Macaulay property.

In this work, we take an alternative approach to the synchronization\nprediction problem by viewing it as a classification problem based on the fact\nthat any given system will eventually synchronize or converge to a\nnon-synchronizing limit cycle. By only using some basic statistics of the\nunderlying graphs such as edge density and diameter, our method can achieve\nperfect accuracy when there is a significant difference in the topology of the\nunderlying graphs between the synchronizing and the non-synchronizing examples.\nHowever, in the problem setting where these graph statistics cannot distinguish\nthe two classes very well (e.g., when the graphs are generated from the same\nrandom graph model), we find that pairing a few iterations of the initial\ndynamics along with the graph statistics as the input to our classification\nalgorithms can lead to significant improvement in accuracy; far exceeding what\nis known by the classical oscillator theory. More surprisingly, we find that in\nalmost all such settings, dropping out the basic graph statistics and training\nour algorithms with only initial dynamics achieves nearly the same accuracy.

Moreover,\nthey still depend on a convenient local filter such as convolution as full 3D\nattention is expensive to compute and requires a big dataset, which might not\nbe available.\n  Methods: We propose to use 3D Axial-Attention, which requires a fraction of\nthe computing power of a regular Non-Local network (i.e., self-attention).\nUnlike a regular Non-Local network, the 3D Axial-Attention network applies the\nattention operation to each axis separately.

CBTs are powerful tools for creating representative maps of brain\nconnectivity in typical and atypical populations. Particularly, estimating a\nwell-centered and representative CBT for populations of multi-view brain\nnetworks (MVBN) is more challenging since these networks sit on complex\nmanifolds and there is no easy way to fuse different heterogeneous network\nviews. This problem remains unexplored with the exception of a few recent works\nrooted in the assumption that the relationship between connectomes are mostly\nlinear. However, such an assumption fails to capture complex patterns and\nnon-linear variation across individuals. Besides, existing methods are simply\ncomposed of sequential MVBN processing blocks without any feedback mechanism,\nleading to error accumulation. To address these issues, we propose Deep Graph\nNormalizer (DGN), the first geometric deep learning (GDL) architecture for\nnormalizing a population of MVBNs by integrating them into a single\nconnectional brain template. Our end-to-end DGN learns how to fuse multi-view\nbrain networks while capturing non-linear patterns across subjects and\npreserving brain graph topological properties by capitalizing on graph\nconvolutional neural networks. We also introduce a randomized weighted loss\nfunction which also acts as a regularizer to minimize the distance between the\npopulation of MVBNs and the estimated CBT, thereby enforcing its centeredness.\nWe demonstrate that DGN significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art\nmethods on estimating CBTs on both small-scale and large-scale connectomic\ndatasets in terms of both representativeness and discriminability (i.e.,\nidentifying distinctive connectivities fingerprinting each brain network\npopulation).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Dec 2020 08:01:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-29"}

However, cache nodes may belong to different\nentities and behave selfishly to maximize their own benefits, which often lead\nto performance degradation for the overall network. While there has been\nextensive literature on allocating contents to caches to maximize the social\nwelfare, the analysis of selfish caching behaviors remains largely unexplored.\nIn this paper, we model the selfish behaviors of cache nodes as selfish caching\ngames on arbitrary directed graphs with heterogeneous content popularity. We\nstudy the existence of a pure strategy Nash equilibrium (PSNE) in selfish\ncaching games, and analyze its efficiency in terms of social welfare. We show\nthat a PSNE does not always exist in arbitrary-topology caching networks.\nHowever, if the network does not have a mixed request loop, i.e., a directed\nloop in which each edge is traversed by at least one content request, we show\nthat a PSNE always exists and can be found in polynomial time. Furthermore, we\ncan avoid mixed request loops by properly choosing request forwarding paths. We\nthen show that the efficiency of Nash equilibria, captured by the price of\nanarchy (PoA), can be arbitrarily poor if we allow arbitrary content request\npatterns, and adding extra cache nodes can make the PoA worse, i.e., cache\nparadox happens. However, when cache nodes have homogeneous request patterns,\nwe show that the PoA is bounded even allowing arbitrary topologies. We further\nanalyze the selfish caching games for cache nodes with limited computational\ncapabilities, and show that an approximate PSNE exists with bounded PoA in\ncertain cases of interest. Simulation results show that increasing the cache\ncapacity in the network improves the efficiency of Nash equilibria, while\nadding extra cache nodes can degrade the efficiency of Nash equilibria.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Dec 2020 08:44:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-29"}

The\ntransition between the two states is also modeled using the random telegraph\nprocess. It is expected that the presented two-state model where we call it\nactive-passive Brownian particle has the characteristics of both pure active-\nand pure passive-Brownian particle.

This\ndissertation explores some advantageous synergies between machine learning,\ncognitive science and neuroscience. In particular, this thesis focuses on\nvision and images. The human visual system has been widely studied from both\nbehavioural and neuroscientific points of view, as vision is the dominant sense\nof most people. In turn, machine vision has also been an active area of\nresearch, currently dominated by the use of artificial neural networks. This\nwork focuses on learning representations that are more aligned with visual\nperception and the biological vision. For that purpose, I have studied tools\nand aspects from cognitive science and computational neuroscience, and\nattempted to incorporate them into machine learning models of vision.\n  A central subject of this dissertation is data augmentation, a commonly used\ntechnique for training artificial neural networks to augment the size of data\nsets through transformations of the images. Although often overlooked, data\naugmentation implements transformations that are perceptually plausible, since\nthey correspond to the transformations we see in our visual world -- changes in\nviewpoint or illumination, for instance. Furthermore, neuroscientists have\nfound that the brain invariantly represents objects under these\ntransformations. Throughout this dissertation, I use these insights to analyse\ndata augmentation as a particularly useful inductive bias, a more effective\nregularisation method for artificial neural networks, and as the framework to\nanalyse and improve the invariance of vision models to perceptually plausible\ntransformations. Overall, this work aims to shed more light on the properties\nof data augmentation and demonstrate the potential of interdisciplinary\nresearch.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Dec 2020 11:00:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-29"}

However, these\noperations are either ill-posed or weak to be discriminant or increase the\nnumber of training parameters and thereby the computational complexity and the\nrisk of overfitting. In this paper, we introduce a novel GCN framework that\nachieves spatial graph convolution in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space\n(RKHS). The latter makes it possible to design, via implicit kernel\nrepresentations, convolutional graph filters in a high dimensional and more\ndiscriminating space without increasing the number of training parameters. The\nparticularity of our GCN model also resides in its ability to achieve\nconvolutions without explicitly realigning nodes in the receptive fields of the\nlearned graph filters with those of the input graphs, thereby making\nconvolutions permutation agnostic and well defined.

This class of PNs is defined as a set of mono-marked state\nmachines (sequential machines, called also agents) cooperating in a distributed\nway through buffers. These buffers could model intermediate products in a\nproduction system or information channel in a healthcare system but they should\nbe destination private to an agent. The designed controller for liveness\nenforcement should preserve this important property characteristic to the\ndistributed systems. The approach in this paper is based on the construction of\na control PN that is an abstraction of the relations of the T-semiflows and\nbuffers. The control PN will evolve in parallel with the system, avoiding the\nfiring of transitions that may lead the system to livelock. An algorithm to\ncompute this control PN is presented. Moreover, in order to ensure the liveness\nof control PN, another algorithm is proposed allowing the firing of local\nT-semiflow in the correct proportion. Finally, an algorithm for guiding the\nsystem evolution is also proposed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Dec 2020 11:31:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-29"}

Objective: We want to achieve\nbetter results in generating test suites with \\Sapienz while avoiding\ntrial-and-error experiments to identify a more suitable configuration of\n\\Sapienz. Method: We conducted a fitness landscape analysis of \\Sapienz to\nanalytically understand the search problem, which allowed us to make informed\ndecisions about the heuristic and configuration of \\Sapienz when developing\n\\SapienzDiv.

The main contribution is the analysis of a probabilistic version\nof an already known algorithm that realizes a CBC construction of such rank-1\nlattices. It turns out that the computational effort of the known deterministic\nalgorithm can be considerably improved in average by means of a simple\nrandomization. Moreover, we give a detailed analysis of the computational costs\nwith respect to a certain failure probability, which then leads to the\ndevelopment of a probabilistic CBC algorithm.

While most\nlatitudes exhibit a low abundance, the Equatorial Zone of Jupiter has an\nabundance of ammonia that is high and nearly uniform with depth. In parallel,\nthe Equatorial Zone is peculiar for its absence of lightning, which is\notherwise prevalent most everywhere else on the planet. We show that a model\naccounting for the presence of small-scale convection and water storms\noriginating in Jupiter's deep atmosphere accounts for the observations. Where\nstrong thunderstorms are observed on the planet, we estimate that the formation\nof ammonia-rich hail ('mushballs') and subsequent downdrafts can deplete\nefficiency the upper atmosphere of its ammonia and transport it efficiently to\nthe deeper levels. In the Equatorial Zone, the absence of thunderstorms shows\nthat this process is not occurring, implying that small-scale convection can\nmaintain a near-homogeneity of this region. A simple model satisfying mass and\nenergy balance accounts for the main features of Juno's MWR observations and\nsuccessfully reproduces the inverse correlation seen between ammonia abundance\nand the lightning rate as function of latitude. We predict that in regions\nwhere ammonia is depleted, water should also be depleted to great depths. The\nfact that condensates are not well mixed by convection until far deeper than\ntheir condensation level has consequences for our understanding of Jupiter's\ndeep interior and of giant-planet atmospheres in general.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 28 Dec 2020 15:57:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-29"}

Moreover, main schemes realizing this in\ngeneral independent of UDA purely involve a single domain, thus might not be\neffective for cross-domain tasks. In this paper, we emphasize the significance\nof reducing feature redundancy for improving UDA in a bi-level way.

The requirement for this exact correspondence\nbetween broadcast and received signals is that each moving point in the\npolarization-current distribution approaches the target at the speed of light\nat all times during its transit along the antenna. This results in a one-to-one\ncorrespondence between the time at which each point on the moving polarization\ncurrent enters the antenna and the time at which {\\it all} of the radiation\nemitted by this particular point during its transit through the antenna arrives\nsimultaneously at the target. This has the effect of reproducing the desired\ntime dependence of the original broadcast signal. For other observer/detector\npositions, the time dependence of the signal is scrambled, due to the\nnon-trivial relationship between emission (retarded) time and reception time.\nThis technique represents a contrast to conventional radio transmission\nmethods; in most examples of the latter, signals are broadcast with little or\nno directivity, selectivity of reception being achieved through the use of\nnarrow frequency bands. In place of this, the current paper uses a spread of\nfrequencies to transmit information to a particular location; the signal is\nweaker and has a scrambled time dependence elsewhere.

Most mid-sized satellites\ncurrently launched and already in orbit fail to comply with the casualty risk\nthreshold of 0.0001. Therefore, satellites manufacturers and mission operators\nneed to perform a disposal through a controlled re-entry, which has a higher\ncost and increased complexity. Through the design-for-demise paradigm, this\nadditional cost and complexity can be removed as the spacecraft is directly\ncompliant with the casualty risk regulations. However, building a spacecraft\nsuch that most of its parts will demise may lead to designs that are more\nvulnerable to space debris impacts, thus compromising the reliability of the\nmission. In fact, the requirements connected to the demisability and the\nsurvivability are in general competing. Given this competing nature, trade-off\nsolutions can be found, which favour the implementation of design-for-demise\nmeasures while still maintaining the spacecraft resilient to space debris\nimpacts. A multi-objective optimisation framework has been developed by the\nauthors in previous works. The framework's objective is to find preliminary\ndesign solutions considering the competing nature of the demisability and the\nsurvivability of a spacecraft since the early stages of the mission design. In\nthis way, a more integrated design can be achieved. The present work focuses on\nthe improvement of the multi-objective optimisation framework by including\nconstraints.

Dispersed \"inclusions\", described by the phase\nfield distribution, are usually three dimensional objects. When describing\nelastic fracture evolution, elements of the dispersed phase are effectively 2d\nobjects. An example of the model which governs evolution of effectively 1d\ndispersed inclusions is phase field model for electric breakdown in solids.\nPhase field model is defined by appropriate free energy functional, which\ndepends on phase field and its derivatives. In this work we show that\ncodimension of the dispersed \"inclusion\" significantly restrict the functional\ndependency of system energy on the derivatives of the problem state variables.\nIt is shown that free energy of any phase field model suitable to describe\ncodimension 2 diffuse objects necessary depends on higher order derivatives of\nthe phase field or need an additional smoothness of the solution - it should\nhave first derivatives integrable with a power greater then two.

Recently,\nthese methods have been extended for model-based segmentation where the network\noutputs the parameters of a geometric model (e.g. an ellipse) directly. This\nwork considers objects whose three-dimensional models can be represented as\nellipsoids. We present a variant of Mask R-CNN for estimating the parameters of\nellipsoidal objects by segmenting each object and accurately regressing the\nparameters of projection ellipses. We show that model regression is sensitive\nto the underlying occlusion scenario and that prediction quality for each\nobject needs to be characterized individually for accurate 3D object\nestimation. We present a novel ellipse regression loss which can learn the\noffset parameters with their uncertainties and quantify the overall geometric\nquality of detection for each ellipse. These values, in turn, allow us to fuse\nmulti-view detections to obtain 3D ellipsoid parameters in a principled\nfashion. The experiments on both synthetic and real datasets quantitatively\ndemonstrate the high accuracy of our proposed method in estimating 3D objects\nunder heavy occlusions compared to previous state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Dec 2020 19:52:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-14"}
