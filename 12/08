Attackers intend to inject hidden backdoors\ninto DNNs, such that the attacked model performs well on benign samples,\nwhereas its prediction will be maliciously changed if hidden backdoors are\nactivated by the attacker-defined trigger. Existing backdoor attacks usually\nadopt the setting that triggers are sample-agnostic, $i.e.,$ different poisoned\nsamples contain the same trigger, resulting in that the attacks could be easily\nmitigated by current backdoor defenses. In this work, we explore a novel attack\nparadigm, where backdoor triggers are sample-specific. In our attack, we only\nneed to modify certain training samples with invisible perturbation, while not\nneed to manipulate other training components ($e.g.$, training loss, and model\nstructure) as required in many existing attacks. Specifically, inspired by the\nrecent advance in DNN-based image steganography, we generate sample-specific\ninvisible additive noises as backdoor triggers by encoding an\nattacker-specified string into benign images through an encoder-decoder\nnetwork. The mapping from the string to the target label will be generated when\nDNNs are trained on the poisoned dataset.

However, it is still challenging to produce\ncompact and discriminative hash codes for images associated with multiple\nsemantics for two main reasons, 1) similarity constraints designed in most of\nthe existing methods are based upon an oversimplified similarity\nassignment(i.e., 0 for instance pairs sharing no label, 1 for instance pairs\nsharing at least 1 label), 2) the exploration in multi-semantic relevance are\ninsufficient or even neglected in many of the existing methods. These problems\nsignificantly limit the discrimination of generated hash codes. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel self-supervised asymmetric deep hashing method with a\nmargin-scalable constraint(SADH) approach to cope with these problems. SADH\nimplements a self-supervised network to sufficiently preserve semantic\ninformation in a semantic feature dictionary and a semantic code dictionary for\nthe semantics of the given dataset, which efficiently and precisely guides a\nfeature learning network to preserve multilabel semantic information using an\nasymmetric learning strategy.

This allows us to establish a relationship\nbetween the spatial density of sub-km craters on Arrokoth and of D~20km craters\non Charon.

They\nconsider fatigue delamination data strongly affected by R-curve behaviour due\nto fibres bridging and argue that a better approach is to correlate the crack\nadvance with the total work per cycle measured in the testing machine. This\nseems to work better than estimating the compliance as a linear fit of\nexperimental curves from Modified Compliance Calibration ASTM standards\nequations for the SERR in the classical Linear Elastic Fracture Mechanics\nframework.

The proposal is very simple, and interesting as it would\nseem to suggest that a proper scaling with a cohesive model at crack tip could\nbe predicted, although this doesn't seem to have been attempted in the\nLiterature.

When a many-body quantum system\nundergoes unitary evolution interspersed with monitored random measurements,\nthe steady-state can exhibit a phase transition between volume and area-law\nentanglement. There is a correspondence between measurement-induced transitions\nin non-unitary quantum circuits in $d$ spatial dimensions and classical\nstatistical mechanical models in $d+1$ dimensions. In certain limits these\nmodels map to percolation, but there is analytical and numerical evidence to\nsuggest that away from these limits the universality class should generically\nbe distinct from percolation. Intriguingly, despite these arguments, numerics\non 1D qubit circuits give bulk exponents which are nonetheless close to those\nof 2D percolation, with possible differences in surface behavior. In the first\npart of this work we study the critical properties of 2D Clifford circuits. In\nthe bulk, we find many properties suggested by the percolation picture,\nincluding matching bulk exponents, and an inverse power-law for the critical\nentanglement growth, $S(t,L) \\sim L(1 - a/t)$, which saturates to an area-law.\nWe then utilize a graph-state based algorithm to analyze in 1D and 2D the\ncritical properties of entanglement clusters in the steady state. We show that\nin a model with a simple geometric map to percolation, the projective\ntransverse field Ising model, the entanglement clusters are governed by\npercolation surface exponents. However, in the Clifford models we find large\ndeviations in the cluster exponents from those of surface percolation,\nhighlighting the breakdown of any possible geometric map to percolation. Given\nthe evidence for deviations from the percolation universality class, our\nresults raise the question of why nonetheless many bulk properties behave\nsimilarly to percolation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Dec 2020 17:08:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Feb 2021 13:57:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 23 Aug 2021 10:54:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-08"}

In\nparticular, we show how the control over the spin-spin interactions can be used\nto perfectly entangle any two spins in the XY chain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Dec 2020 17:36:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Dec 2021 10:54:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-10"}

To estimate this sum,\nprior work proposes Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods that use random\nwalks started at some seed vertex and whose equilibrium distribution is the\nuniform distribution over all edges, eliminating the need to iterate over all\nedges. Unfortunately, these existing estimators are not scalable to massive\nreal-world graphs. In this paper, we introduce Ripple, an MCMC-based estimator\nthat achieves unprecedented scalability by stratifying the Markov chain state\nspace into ordered strata with a new technique that we denote {\\em sequential\nstratified regenerations}. We show that the Ripple estimator is consistent,\nhighly parallelizable, and scales well.\n  We empirically evaluate our method by applying Ripple to the task of\nestimating connected, induced subgraph counts given some input graph. Therein,\nwe demonstrate that Ripple is accurate and can estimate counts of up to\n$12$-node subgraphs, which is a task at a scale that has been considered\nunreachable, not only by prior MCMC-based methods but also by other sampling\napproaches.

It has been proposed that they\nare young, having formed a large fraction of their stellar mass during their\nlast few hundred Myr. However, little is known about the fraction of young\nstellar populations in more massive galaxies. In a previous article, we\nanalyzed 280 000 SDSS spectra to identify a surprisingly large sample of more\nmassive Very Young Galaxies (VYGs), defined to have formed at least $50\\%$ of\ntheir stellar mass within the last 1 Gyr. Here, we investigate in detail the\nproperties of a subsample of 207 galaxies that are VYGs according to all three\nof our spectral models. We compare their properties with those of control\nsample galaxies (CSGs). We find that VYGs tend to have higher surface\nbrightness and to be more compact, dusty, asymmetric, and clumpy than CSGs.\nAnalysis of a subsample with HI detections reveals that VYGs are more gas-rich\nthan CSGs. VYGs tend to reside more in the inner parts of low-mass groups and\nare twice as likely to be interacting with a neighbour galaxy than CSGs. On the\nother hand, VYGs and CSGs have similar gas metallicities and large scale\nenvironments (relative to filaments and voids). These results suggest that\ngas-rich interactions and mergers are the main mechanisms responsible for the\nrecent triggering of star formation in low-redshift VYGs, except for the lowest\nmass VYGs, where the starbursts may arise from a mixture of mergers and gas\ninfall.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Dec 2020 17:50:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-03"}

However, these approaches are not always viable. We propose an\nalternative, passive approach to {\\it a priori} tune the elastohydrodynamics in\na microsystem, towards achieving a pre-determined (but not pre-fabricated) flow\ngeometry when the microchannel is subjected to flow. That is to say, we use the\ninteraction between a soft solid layer, the viscous flow beneath it and the\nshaped rigid wall above it, to tune the fluid domain's shape. Specifically, we\nstudy a parallel-wall microchannel whose top wall is a slender soft coating of\narbitrary thickness attached to a rigid platform. We derive a nonlinear\ndifferential equation for the soft coating's fluid--solid interface, which we\nuse to infer how to achieve specific conduit shapes during flow. Using this\ntheory, we demonstrate the tuning of four categories of microchannel\ngeometries, which establishes, via a proof-of-concept, the viability of our\nmodeling framework. We also explore slip length patterning on the rigid bottom\nwall of the microchannel, a common technique in microfluidics, as an addition\n`handle' for microchannel shape control.

Low-ionization state absorption\nlines are a common feature in the spectrum of galaxies, showing a diversity of\nstrengths and shapes. Since these lines indicate the presence of neutral gas in\nfront of the stars, they have been proposed to carry information on the escape\nof ionizing radiation from galaxies. We study which processes are responsible\nfor the shape of the absorption lines, to better understand their origin. We\nthen explore whether the absorption lines can be used to predict the escape\nfractions. Using a radiation-hydrodynamical zoom-in simulation and the\nradiative transfer code RASCAS, we generate mock CII 1334 and LyB lines of a\nvirtual galaxy at redshift 3 as seen from many directions of observation. We\nalso compute the escape fraction of ionizing photons in those directions and\nlook for correlations between the lines and the escape fractions. We find that\nthe resulting mock absorption lines are comparable to observations and that the\nlines and the escape fractions vary strongly depending on the direction of\nobservation. Gas velocity and dust always affect the absorption profile\nsignificantly. We find no strong correlations between observable LyB or CII\n1334 and the escape fraction. After correcting the continuum for attenuation by\ndust to recover the intrinsic continuum, the residual flux of CII 1334\ncorrelates well with the escape fraction for directions with a dust corrected\nresidual flux larger than 30%. For other directions, the relations have a\nstrong dispersion, and the residual flux overestimates the escape fraction for\nmost cases. Concerning LyB, the residual flux after dust correction does not\ncorrelate with the escape fraction but can be used as a lower limit.

The most direct keys to formation, which are obtained from younger\nobjects (pre-BD cores and proto-BDs), are limited by the very low number\nstatistics available. We aim to identify and characterize a set of pre- and\nproto-BDs as well as Class II BDs in the Lupus 1 and 3 molecular clouds to test\ntheir formation mechanism. We performed ALMA band 6 (1.3 mm) continuum\nobservations of a selection of 64 cores previously identified from AzTEC/ASTE\ndata (1.1 mm), along with previously known Class II BDs in the Lupus 1 and 3\nmolecular clouds. Surveyed archival data in the optical were used to complement\nthese observations. We expect these ALMA observations prove efficient in\ndetecting the youngest sources in these regions, since they probe the frequency\ndomain at which these sources emit most of their radiation. We detected 19\nsources from 15 ALMA fields. Considering all the pointings in our observing\nsetup, the ALMA detection rate was $\\sim$23% and the derived masses of the\ndetected sources were between $\\sim$0.18 and 124 $\\mathrm{M_{Jup}}$. We\nclassified these sources according to their spectral energy distribution as 5\nClass II sources, 2 new Class I/0 candidats, and 12 new possible pre-BD or\ndeeply embedded protostellar candidates. We detected a promising candidate for\na Class 0/I proto-BD source and inferred the disk dust mass of a bona fide\nClass II BD. The pre-BD cores might be the byproduct of an ongoing process of\nlarge-scale collapse. The Class II BD disks follow the correlation between disk\nmass and the mass of the central object that is observed at the low-mass\nstellar regime. We conclude that it is highly probable that the sources in the\nsample are formed as a scaled-down version of low-mass star formation, although\ndisk fragmentation may be responsible for a considerable fraction of BDs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Dec 2020 19:00:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-10"}

To enable a good prediction of the end of discharge of\nbatteries, detailed electrochemical Li-I battery models have been developed.\nTheir parameters are typically calibrated before they are taken into operation\nand are typically not re-calibrated during operation. However, since battery\nperformance is affected by aging, the reality gap between the computational\nbattery models and the real physical systems leads to inaccurate predictions. A\nsupervised machine learning algorithm would require an extensive representative\ntraining dataset mapping the observation to the ground truth calibration\nparameters. This may be infeasible for many practical applications. In this\npaper, we implement a Reinforcement Learning-based framework for reliably and\nefficiently inferring calibration parameters of battery models. The framework\nenables real-time inference of the computational model parameters in order to\ncompensate the reality-gap from the observations. Most importantly, the\nproposed methodology does not need any labeled data samples, (samples of\nobservations and the ground truth calibration parameters). Furthermore, the\nframework does not require any information on the underlying physical model.\nThe experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methodology is capable\nof inferring the model parameters with high accuracy and high robustness.

We present the first approach\nthat regresses 3D face shape and animatable details that are specific to an\nindividual but change with expression.

We probe 1-10 keV\nX-ray luminosities as low as $L_{\\rm X}\\sim4\\times10^{32}$ erg s$^{-1}$,\nequivalent to Eddington fractions of $\\sim4\\times10^{-7}$. During its decay\ntowards quiescence, the X-ray spectrum of MAXI J1820$+$070 softens from\n$\\Gamma\\sim1.7$ to $\\Gamma\\sim2$, with the softening taking $\\sim30$d, and\ncompleting at $L_{\\rm X}\\approx10^{34}$ erg s$^{-1}$ ($\\approx10^{-5} L_{\\rm\nEdd}$). While the X-ray spectrum softens, the radio spectrum generally remains\nflat/inverted throughout the decay. We also find that MAXI J1820$+$070 follows\na radio ($L_{\\rm R}$) -- X-ray luminosity correlation of the form $L_{\\rm R}\n\\propto L_{\\rm X}^{0.52\\pm0.07}$, making it the fourth black hole system to\nfollow the so-called `standard track' unbroken over several (in this case,\nfour) decades in $L_{\\rm X}$. Comparing the radio/X-ray spectral evolution(s)\nwith the $L_{\\rm R}$ -- $L_{\\rm X}$ plane, we find that the X-ray softening is\nconsistent with X-rays produced by Comptonization processes in a radiatively\ninefficient accretion flow. We generally disfavor X-ray emission originating\nsolely from within the jet, with the possible exception of X-rays produced via\nsynchrotron self-Compton processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Dec 2020 20:03:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-17"}

Many of these interesting dynamics arise from the unique\nstructure of the modulation equations that are nonstrictly hyperbolic,\nincluding a well-defined multivalued solution interpreted as a solution of the\n(2+1)-dimensional soliton-mean modulation equations, in which the soliton\ninteracts with the mean flow and then wraps around to interact with it again.\nFinally, it is shown that the oblique interactions between solitons and\ndispersive shock wave solutions for the mean flow give rise to all three\npossible types of 2-soliton solutions of the KPII equation. The analytical\nfindings are quantitatively supported by direct numerical simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Dec 2020 20:30:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-11"}

The exposure of TMD based\ndevices to light generates photo-carriers resulting in an enhanced\nconductivity, which can be effectively used, e.g., in photodetectors. If the\nphoto-enhanced conductivity persists after removal of the irradiation, the\neffect is known as persistent photoconductivity (PPC). Here we show that\nultraviolet light (wavelength = 365 nm) exposure induces an extremely\nlong-living giant PPC (GPPC) in monolayer MoS2 (ML-MoS2) field-effect\ntransistors (FET) with a time constant of ~30 days. Furthermore, this effect\nleads to a large enhancement of the conductivity up to a factor of 107. In\ncontrast to previous studies in which the origin of the PPC was attributed to\nextrinsic reasons such as trapped charges in the substrate or adsorbates, we\nunambiguously show that the GPPC arises mainly from the intrinsic properties of\nML-MoS2 such as lattice defects that induce a large amount of localized states\nin the forbidden gap. This finding is supported by a detailed experimental and\ntheoretical study of the electric transport in TMD based FETs as well as by\ncharacterization of ML-MoS2 with scanning tunneling spectroscopy,\nhigh-resolution transmission electron microscopy, and photoluminescence\nmeasurements. The obtained results provide a basis towards the defect-based\nengineering of the electronic and optical properties of TMDs for device\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Dec 2020 20:38:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-12"}

The quantum\nenvironment can have arbitrary (e.g. structured) spectral density. The\nentanglement can be seen constructively as a Lego: its bricks are the modes of\nthe environment. These bricks are connected to each other via operator\ntransforms. The central result is that each infinitesimal time interval one new\n(incoming) mode of the environment gets coupled (entangled) to the open system,\nand one new (outgoing) mode gets irreversibly decoupled (disentangled from\nfuture). Moreover, each moment of time, only a few relevant modes (3 - 4 in the\nconsidered cases) are non-negligibly coupled to the future quantum motion.\nThese relevant mode change (flow, or renormalize) with time. As a result, the\ntemporal entanglement has the structure of a matrix-product operator.

By means of the multiscale\nrefinement of the second moment method we obtain a fairly precise geometrical\ndescription of optimal paths, i.e. of polymers with minimal energy. The picture\nwhich emerges can be loosely summarized as follows. The energy of the polymer\nis, to first approximation, uniformly spread along the strand. The polymer's\nbonds carry however a lower energy than in the directed setting, and are\nreached through the following geometrical evolution. Close to the origin, the\npolymer proceeds in oriented fashion -- it is thus as stretched as possible.\nThe tension of the strand decreases however gradually, with the polymer\nallowing for more and more backsteps as it enters the core of the hypercube.\nBacksteps, although increasing the length of the strand, allow the polymer to\nconnect reservoirs of energetically favorable edges which are otherwise\nunattainable in a fully directed regime. These reservoirs lie at mesoscopic\ndistance apart, but in virtue of the high dimensional nature of the ambient\nspace, the polymer manages to connect them through approximate geodesics with\nrespect to the Hamming metric: this is the key strategy which leads to an\noptimal energy/entropy balance. Around halfway, the mirror picture sets in: the\npolymer tension gradually builds up again, until full orientedness close to the\nendpoint.

This approach can produce socially\nunacceptable responses due to the lack of large-scale quality data used to\ntrain the neural models. However, recent work has shown the promise of\ncombining dialogue act/intent modelling and neural response generation. This\nhybrid method improves the response quality of chatbots and makes them more\ncontrollable and interpretable. A key element in dialog intent modelling is the\ndevelopment of a taxonomy.

Specifically the algorithm should output each $k$-clique with\nprobability $(1\\pm \\epsilon)/n_k$, where $n_k$ denotes the number of\n$k$-cliques in the graph and $\\epsilon$ is a given approximation parameter.\n  We prove that the query complexity of this problem is \\[\n\\Theta^*\\left(\\max\\left\\{ \\left(\\frac{(n\\alpha)^{k/2}}{\nn_k}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{k-1}} ,\\; \\min\\left\\{n\\alpha,\\frac{n\\alpha^{k-1}}{n_k}\n\\right\\}\\right\\}\\right). \\] where $n$ is the number of vertices in the graph,\n$\\alpha$ is its arboricity, and $\\Theta^*$ suppresses the dependence on $(\\log\nn/\\epsilon)^{O(k)}$. Interestingly, this establishes a separation between\napproximate counting and approximate uniform sampling in the sublinear regime.\nFor example, if $k=3$, $\\alpha = O(1)$, and $n_3$ (the number of triangles) is\n$\\Theta(n)$, then we get a lower bound of $\\Omega(n^{1/4})$ (for constant\n$\\epsilon$), while under these conditions, a $(1\\pm \\epsilon)$-approximation of\n$n_3$ can be obtained by performing $\\textrm{poly}(\\log(n/\\epsilon))$ queries\n(Eden, Ron and Seshadhri, SODA20).\n  Our lower bound follows from a construction of a family of graphs with\narboricity $\\alpha$ such that in each graph there are $n_k$ cliques (of size\n$k$), where one of these cliques is \"hidden\" and hence hard to sample. Our\nupper bound is based on defining a special auxiliary graph $H_k$, such that\nsampling edges almost uniformly in $H_k$ translates to sampling $k$-cliques\nalmost uniformly in the original graph $G$. We then build on a known\nedge-sampling algorithm (Eden, Ron and Rosenbaum, ICALP19) to sample edges in\n$H_k$, where the challenge is simulate queries to $H_k$ while being given\naccess only to $G$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Dec 2020 22:23:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-09"}

Similar to the utterance level SpecAugment, f-SpecAugment\nperforms three transformations: time warping, frequency masking, and time\nmasking. Instead of applying the transformations at the utterance level,\nf-SpecAugment applies them to each convolution window independently during\ntraining. We demonstrate that f-SpecAugment is more effective than the\nutterance level SpecAugment for deep CNN based hybrid models. We evaluate the\nproposed f-SpecAugment on 50-layer Self-Normalizing Deep CNN (SNDCNN) acoustic\nmodels trained with up to 25000 hours of training data.

All three markets coexist with equal shares of traders\nonly when either learning is too weak and traders choose randomly, or when\nmarkets are identical. In the latter case, the population of traders is\nfragmented across the markets. For the more general case of markets with\ndifferent biases, we note that market dominance is the more typical scenario.\nThese results are interesting because previously either strong differentiation\nof markets or heterogeneity in the needs of traders was found to be a necessary\ncondition for market coexistence. We show that, in contrast, these states can\nemerge simply as a consequence of co-adaptation of an initially homogeneous\npopulation of traders.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 7 Dec 2020 23:02:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Aug 2021 17:17:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-24"}

Our next step toward universal\nfault-tolerant quantum computation is a protocol for fault-tolerant Toffoli\nmagic state preparation that significantly improves upon the fidelity of\nphysical Toffoli gates at very low qubit cost.

Also,\nthe difficulty should not be more for data with obscured faces, heavier poses,\nand lower quality. Existing methods tend to focus on samples with variation in\npose, but with the assumption data is high in quality.

We integrate a super-resolution (SR) side-view\nmodule into SF-GAN to preserve identity information and fine details of the\nside-views in HR space, which helps model reconstruct high-frequency\ninformation of faces (i.e., periocular, nose, and mouth regions). Moreover,\nSF-GAN accepts multiple LR faces as input, and improves each added sample.

A variety of mechanisms have been\nproposed in the literature for releasing the output of numeric queries (e.g.,\nthe Laplace mechanism and smooth sensitivity mechanism). Those mechanisms\nguarantee differential privacy by adding noise to the true query's output. The\namount of noise added is calibrated by the notions of global sensitivity and\nlocal sensitivity of the query that measure the impact of the addition or\nremoval of an individual on the query's output. Mechanisms that use local\nsensitivity add less noise and, consequently, have a more accurate answer.\nHowever, although there has been some work on generic mechanisms for releasing\nthe output of non-numeric queries using global sensitivity (e.g., the\nExponential mechanism), the literature lacks generic mechanisms for releasing\nthe output of non-numeric queries using local sensitivity to reduce the noise\nin the query's output. In this work, we remedy this shortcoming and present the\nlocal dampening mechanism. We adapt the notion of local sensitivity for the\nnon-numeric setting and leverage it to design a generic non-numeric mechanism.\nWe provide theoretical comparisons to the exponential mechanism and show under\nwhich conditions the local dampening mechanism is more accurate than the\nexponential mechanism.

We alleviate the high memory\nrequirement by sharing the parameters of Transformers across layers and\nmodalities; we decompose the Transformer into modality-specific and\nmodality-shared parts so that the model learns the dynamics of each modality\nboth individually and together, and propose a novel parameter sharing scheme\nbased on low-rank approximation. We show that our approach reduces parameters\nof the Transformers up to 97$\\%$, allowing us to train our model end-to-end\nfrom scratch. We also propose a negative sampling approach based on an instance\nsimilarity measured on the CNN embedding space that our model learns together\nwith the Transformers. To demonstrate our approach, we pretrain our model on\n30-second clips (480 frames) from Kinetics-700 and transfer it to audio-visual\nclassification tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2020 00:16:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Sep 2021 16:19:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-23"}

The observability\nanalysis of the system is performed to investigate the roles of the ZUPT\nmeasurement and the foot-to-foot ranging measurement in improving the state\nestimability. A Kalman-based estimation algorithm is mechanized in the Earth\nframe, rather than in the common local-level frame, which is found to be\neffective in depressing the linearization error in Kalman filtering. An\nellipsoid constraint in the Earth frame is also proposed to further restrict\nthe height drift.

Many current rotation detectors\nuse plenty of anchors with different orientations to achieve spatial alignment\nwith ground truth boxes, then Intersection-over-Union (IoU) is applied to\nsample the positive and negative candidates for training. However, we observe\nthat the selected positive anchors cannot always ensure accurate detections\nafter regression, while some negative samples can achieve accurate\nlocalization. It indicates that the quality assessment of anchors through IoU\nis not appropriate, and this further lead to inconsistency between\nclassification confidence and localization accuracy. In this paper, we propose\na dynamic anchor learning (DAL) method, which utilizes the newly defined\nmatching degree to comprehensively evaluate the localization potential of the\nanchors and carry out a more efficient label assignment process. In this way,\nthe detector can dynamically select high-quality anchors to achieve accurate\nobject detection, and the divergence between classification and regression will\nbe alleviated.

Results: The fluctuations inherent in the fission process ensure that\nthe spin of the initial compound nucleus has only a small influence on the\nfragment spins which are therefore nearly uncorrelated. There is a marked\ncorrelation between the spin magnitude of the fission fragments and the photon\nmultiplicity.

In this work, we show the additional benefits of\nrandomization and asynchrony on the stability of linear dynamical systems. We\nintroduce a natural model for random asynchronous linear time-invariant (LTI)\nsystems which generalizes the standard (synchronous) LTI systems. In this\nmodel, each state variable is updated randomly and asynchronously with some\nprobability according to the underlying system dynamics. We examine how the\nmean-square stability of random asynchronous LTI systems vary with respect to\nrandomization and asynchrony. Surprisingly, we show that the stability of\nrandom asynchronous LTI systems does not imply or is not implied by the\nstability of the synchronous variant of the system and an unstable synchronous\nsystem can be stabilized via randomization and/or asynchrony. We further study\na special case of the introduced model, namely randomized LTI systems, where\neach state element is updated randomly with some fixed but unknown probability.\nWe consider the problem of system identification of unknown randomized LTI\nsystems using the precise characterization of mean-square stability via\nextended Lyapunov equation.

To this\nend, we propose an end-to-end and straightforward framework for crowd\nlocalization, named Independent Instance Map segmentation (IIM). Different from\ndensity maps and boxes regression, each instance in IIM is non-overlapped. By\nsegmenting crowds into independent connected components, the positions and the\ncrowd counts (the centers and the number of components, respectively) are\nobtained. Furthermore, to improve the segmentation quality for different\ndensity regions, we present a differentiable Binarization Module (BM) to output\nstructured instance maps.

Diffuse\ninterfaces could arise if accretion favored a central concentration of the\nleast volatile constituents (also incidentally the most dense); compositional\ngradients arising in such a structure would likely inhibit convection.\nCurrently, two lines of evidence suggest possible hydrogen-water immiscibility\nin ice giant interiors. The first arises from crude extrapolation of the\nexperimental hydrogen-water critical curve to $\\sim 3$ GPa (Bali et al. 2013).\nThe data are obtained for an impure system containing silicates, though Uranus\nand Neptune could also be \"dirty.\" Current ab initio models disagree (Soubiran\n& Militzer 2015), though hydrogen and water are difficult to model from\nfirst-principles quantum mechanics with the necessary precision. The second\nargument for hydrogen-water immiscibility in ice giants, outlined herein,\ninvokes reasoning about the gravitational and magnetic fields. While consensus\nremains lacking, here we examine the immiscible case. Applying the resulting\nthermodynamic constraints, we find that Neptune models with envelopes\ncontaining a substantial water mole fraction, as much as $\\chi \\gtrsim 0.1$\nrelative to hydrogen, can satisfy observations. In contrast, Uranus models\nappear to require $\\chi \\lesssim 0.01$, potentially suggestive of fully demixed\nhydrogen and water. Enough gravitational potential energy would be available\nfrom gradual hydrogen-water demixing, to supply Neptune's present-day heatflow\nfor roughly ten solar system lifetimes. Hydrogen-water demixing could slow\nNeptune's cooling rate by an order of magnitude; different hydrogen-water\ndemixing states could account for the different heatflows of Uranus and\nNeptune.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2020 02:20:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 30 Jan 2021 23:35:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-02"}

It allows robots to primarily measure relative direction, or\nAngle-of-Arrival (AOA), to other robots, while operating in non-line-of-sight\nunmapped environments and without requiring external infrastructure. We do so\nby capturing all of the paths that a wireless signal traverses as it travels\nfrom a transmitting to a receiving robot in the team, which we term as an AOA\nprofile. The key intuition behind our approach is to enable a robot to emulate\nantenna arrays as it moves freely in 2D and 3D space. The small differences in\nthe phase of the wireless signals are thus processed with knowledge of robots'\nlocal displacement to obtain the profile, via a method akin to Synthetic\nAperture Radar (SAR).

It is shown, under the assumption that the\ncorrelations are affine in nature, such network of nodal interactions is\nequivalent to a network with added agents, represented by nodes that are\nlatent, where no corresponding time-series measurements are available; however,\nhere all exogenous excitements are spatially (that is, across agents)\nuncorrelated. Generalizing affine correlations, it is shown that, under\npolynomial correlations, the latent nodes in the expanded networks can be\nexcited by clusters of noise sources, where the clusters are uncorrelated with\neach other.

Federated learning (FL) is an emerging\nlearning paradigm that enables collaborative learning among multiple clients,\nwhich can mitigate the issue of label scarcity and protect data privacy as\nwell. Therefore, performing GraphSSC under the FL setting is a promising\nsolution to solve real-world graph-based problems. However, existing FL methods\n1) perform poorly when data across clients are non-IID, 2) cannot handle data\nwith new label domains, and 3) cannot leverage unlabeled data, while all these\nissues naturally happen in real-world graph-based problems. To address the\nabove issues, we propose the first FL framework, namely GraphFL, for\nsemi-supervised node classification on graphs. Our framework is motivated by\nmeta-learning methods. Specifically, we propose two GraphFL methods to\nrespectively address the non-IID issue in graph data and handle the tasks with\nnew label domains. Furthermore, we design a self-training method to leverage\nunlabeled graph data. We adopt representative graph neural networks as GraphSSC\nmethods and evaluate GraphFL on multiple graph datasets. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that GraphFL significantly outperforms the compared FL baseline and\nGraphFL with self-training can obtain better performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2020 03:13:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-09"}

To acquire the\nstructural information in source code, most existing researches use abstract\nsyntax trees (AST). A group of works add additional edges to ASTs to convert\nsource code into graphs and use graph neural networks to learn representations\nfor program graphs. Although these works provide additional control or data\nflow information to ASTs for downstream tasks, they neglect an important aspect\nof structure information in AST itself: the different types of nodes and edges.\nIn ASTs, different nodes contain different kinds of information like variables\nor control flow, and the relation between a node and all its children can also\nbe different.\n  To address the information of node and edge types, we bring the idea of\nheterogeneous graphs to learning on source code and present a new formula of\nbuilding heterogeneous program graphs from ASTs with additional type\ninformation for nodes and edges. We use the ASDL grammar of programming\nlanguage to define the node and edge types of program graphs. Then we use\nheterogeneous graph neural networks to learn on these graphs. We evaluate our\napproach on two tasks: code comment generation and method naming. Both tasks\nrequire reasoning on the semantics of complete code snippets.

Conversely, obtaining enough training data for many\napplications is financially prohibitive or may be infeasible, especially when\nthe application involves modeling rare or extreme events. Synthetically\ngenerating data (and labels) using a generative model that can sample from a\ntarget distribution and exploit the multi-scale nature of images can be an\ninexpensive solution to address scarcity of labeled data. Towards this goal, we\npresent a deep conditional generative model, called VAE-Info-cGAN, that\ncombines a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with a conditional Information\nMaximizing Generative Adversarial Network (InfoGAN), for synthesizing\nsemantically rich images simultaneously conditioned on a pixel-level condition\n(PLC) and a macroscopic feature-level condition (FLC). Dimensionally, the PLC\ncan only vary in the channel dimension from the synthesized image and is meant\nto be a task-specific input. The FLC is modeled as an attribute vector in the\nlatent space of the generated image which controls the contributions of various\ncharacteristic attributes germane to the target distribution. An interpretation\nof the attribute vector to systematically generate synthetic images by varying\na chosen binary macroscopic feature is explored. Experiments on a GPS\ntrajectories dataset show that the proposed model can accurately generate\nvarious forms of spatio-temporal aggregates across different geographic\nlocations while conditioned only on a raster representation of the road\nnetwork. The primary intended application of the VAE-Info-cGAN is synthetic\ndata (and label) generation for targeted data augmentation for computer\nvision-based modeling of problems relevant to geospatial analysis and remote\nsensing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2020 03:46:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-09"}

When there is no errors-in-variables (EIV), the optimal\nweight matrix in estimating the regression coefficients is the precision matrix\nof the regression error which, in practice, is never known and has to be\nestimated from climate model simulations. We construct a weight matrix by\ninverting a nonlinear shrinkage estimate of the error covariance matrix that\nminimizes loss functions directly targeting the uncertainty of the resulting\nregression coefficient estimator.

The maximum pressure corresponds to a local or global maximum\nmass for the phase transformed hybrid star. The phase transition is usually\nexothermic if we have a local maximum mass. The criteria for exothermic or\nendothermic phase transition depend on whether the quark pressure/energy ratios\nto nuclear pressure/energy are smaller or greater than 1.

The phase transition is\nendothermic for a global maximum pressure; thereby, one gets a global maximum\nmass. Hybrid stars much massive than phase transformed local maximum mass can\nbe formed, provided there is some external energy source during the phase\ntransition process. However, for some cases, even massive hybrid stars can form\nwith exothermic phase transition for EoSs having global maximum pressure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2020 04:56:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-24"}

Thus, early fake news detection remains a tough challenge.\nIntuitively, the news from trusted and authoritative sources or shared by many\nusers with a good reputation is more reliable than other news.

In this way, we can explicitly exploit the\ncredibility of publishers and users for early fake news detection.

It is essential to obtain channel information by beam tracking\nscheme to track mobile users in THz massive MIMO systems. However, the existing\nbeam tracking schemes designed for narrowband systems with the traditional\nhybrid precoding structure suffer from a severe performance loss caused by the\nbeam split effect, and thus cannot be directly applied to wideband THz massive\nMIMO systems. To solve this problem, in this paper we propose a beam zooming\nbased beam tracking scheme by considering the recently proposed delay-phase\nprecoding structure for THz massive MIMO. Specifically, we firstly prove the\nbeam zooming mechanism to flexibly control the angular coverage of\nfrequencydependent beams over the whole bandwidth, which can be realized by the\nelaborate design of time delays in the delay-phase precoding structure. Then,\nbased on this beam zooming mechanism, we propose to track multiple user\nphysical directions simultaneously in each time slot by generating multiple\nbeams. The angular coverage of these beams is flexibly zoomed to adapt to the\npotential variation range of the user physical direction. After several time\nslots, the base station is able to obtain the exact user physical direction by\nfinding out the beam with the largest user received power. Unlike traditional\nschemes where only one frequency-independent beam can be usually generated by\none radio-frequency chain, the proposed beam zooming based beam tracking scheme\ncan simultaneously track multiple user physical directions by using multiple\nfrequency-dependent beams generated by one radio-frequency chain.

To support diverse DNN models, efficient\nimplementations of DNN inference on edge-computing platforms, e.g., ASICs,\nFPGAs, and embedded systems, are extensively investigated. Due to the huge\nmodel size and computation amount, model compression is a critical step to\ndeploy DNN models on edge devices. This paper focuses on weight quantization, a\nhardware-friendly model compression approach that is complementary to weight\npruning. Unlike existing methods that use the same quantization scheme for all\nweights, we propose the first solution that applies different quantization\nschemes for different rows of the weight matrix. It is motivated by (1) the\ndistribution of the weights in the different rows are not the same; and (2) the\npotential of achieving better utilization of heterogeneous FPGA hardware\nresources. To achieve that, we first propose a hardware-friendly quantization\nscheme named sum-of-power-of-2 (SP2) suitable for Gaussian-like weight\ndistribution, in which the multiplication arithmetic can be replaced with logic\nshifter and adder, thereby enabling highly efficient implementations with the\nFPGA LUT resources. In contrast, the existing fixed-point quantization is\nsuitable for Uniform-like weight distribution and can be implemented\nefficiently by DSP. Then to fully explore the resources, we propose an\nFPGA-centric mixed scheme quantization (MSQ) with an ensemble of the proposed\nSP2 and the fixed-point schemes.

Modeling probability distributions\non deep features has recently emerged as an effective, yet computationally\ncheap method to detect OOD samples in DNN. However, the features produced by a\nDNN at any given layer do not fully occupy the corresponding high-dimensional\nfeature space. We apply linear statistical dimensionality reduction techniques\nand nonlinear manifold-learning techniques on the high-dimensional features in\norder to capture the true subspace spanned by the features. We hypothesize that\nsuch lower-dimensional feature embeddings can mitigate the curse of\ndimensionality, and enhance any feature-based method for more efficient and\neffective performance. In the context of uncertainty estimation and OOD, we\nshow that the log-likelihood score obtained from the distributions learnt on\nthis lower-dimensional subspace is more discriminative for OOD detection. We\nalso show that the feature reconstruction error, which is the $L_2$-norm of the\ndifference between the original feature and the pre-image of its embedding, is\nhighly effective for OOD detection and in some cases superior to the\nlog-likelihood scores. The benefits of our approach are demonstrated on image\nfeatures by detecting OOD images, using popular DNN architectures on commonly\nused image datasets such as CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and SVHN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2020 07:07:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-09"}

The wave equation-based model for online social networks (called the\noscillation model) is a theoretical model proposed to describe user dynamics in\nonline social networks. This model can be used to understand the relationship\nbetween explosive user dynamics and the structure of social networks.

Payment networks have emerged to overcome this\nlimitation by executing transactions outside of the blockchain, which is why\nthese are referred to as off-chain transactions. In order to establish a\npayment channel between two users, the users lock their deposits in the\nblockchain, and then they can pay each other through the channel. Furthermore,\npayment networks support multi-hop payments that allow users to transfer their\nbalances to other users who are connected to them via multiple channels.\nHowever, multi-hop payments are hard to be accomplished, as they are heavily\ndependent on routing users on a payment path from a sender to a receiver.\nAlthough routing hubs can make multi-hop payments more practical and efficient,\nthey need a lot of collateral locked for a long period and have privacy issues\nin terms of payment history.\n  We propose RouTEE, a secure payment routing hub that is fully feasible\nwithout the hub's deposit. Unlike existing payment networks, RouTEE provides\nhigh balance liquidity, and details about payments are concealed from hosts by\nleveraging trusted execution environments (TEEs). RouTEE is designed to make\nrational hosts behave honestly, by introducing a new routing fee scheme and a\nsecure settlement method. Moreover, users do not need to monitor the blockchain\nin real-time or run full nodes. They can participate in RouTEE by simply\nverifying block headers through light clients; furthermore, having only one\nchannel with RouTEE is sufficient to interact with other users. Our\nimplementation demonstrates that RouTEE is highly efficient and outperforms\nLightning Network that is the state-of-the-art payment network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2020 07:34:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-09"}

In this work, we study optical\ncharacterization of SiO_xN_y layers deposited via reactive dual ion beam\nsputtering. To characterize the deposited layers, we use several methods\nincluding reflectance, and transmittance spectra at a broad range of incident\nangles, together with spectral ellipsometry. All the data were simultaneously\nfitted with a general profile of refractive index. The expected profile used in\nour fit was based on characterization of SiO_xN_y layers with a varying\nstoichiometry. By altering of the profile, we discussed sensitivity of such\nalternation on fit quality and we studied ambiguity of merit-function\nminimization. We demonstrate that while the scanning of particular parameters\nof the profile can be seemingly very precise, we obtain a very good agreement\nbetween the experimental data and model for a broad range of gradient shapes,\nwhere the refractive-index value on major part of the profile can differ as\nmuch as 0.02 from the mean value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2020 07:50:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-03"}

At the\nheart of this progress resides the identification of two intrinsic, near crack\ntip length scales -- a nonlinear elastic length scale $\\ell$ and a dissipation\nlength scale $\\xi$ -- that do not exist in the classical theory of cracks. In\nparticular, it has been shown that at a high propagation velocity $v$, cracks\nin 2D brittle materials undergo an oscillatory instability whose wavelength\nvaries linearly with $\\ell$, and at yet higher propagation velocities and\nlarger loading levels, a tip-splitting instability emerges, both in agreements\nwith experiments.

This result shows that the instability crucially depends on the\nexistence of an intrinsic length scale associated with the breakdown of linear\nelasticity near crack tips, independently of whether the latter is related to\nnonlinear elasticity or to dissipation. (ii) It is a supercritical Hopf\nbifurcation, featuring a vanishing oscillations amplitude at onset.

These results substantiate the universal nature of the\noscillatory instability of ultra-high speed cracks in 2D. In addition, we\nprovide evidence indicating that the ultra-high velocity tip-splitting\ninstability is controlled by the limiting rate of elastic energy transport\ninside the crack tip region.

Mainstream UDA\nmethods strive to learn domain-aligned features such that classifiers trained\non the source features can be readily applied to the target ones. Although\nimpressive results have been achieved, these methods have a potential risk of\ndamaging the intrinsic data structures of target discrimination, raising an\nissue of generalization particularly for UDA tasks in an inductive setting. To\naddress this issue, we are motivated by a UDA assumption of structural\nsimilarity across domains, and propose to directly uncover the intrinsic target\ndiscrimination via constrained clustering, where we constrain the clustering\nsolutions using structural source regularization that hinges on the very same\nassumption. Technically, we propose a hybrid model of Structurally Regularized\nDeep Clustering, which integrates the regularized discriminative clustering of\ntarget data with a generative one, and we thus term our method as H-SRDC. Our\nhybrid model is based on a deep clustering framework that minimizes the\nKullback-Leibler divergence between the distribution of network prediction and\nan auxiliary one, where we impose structural regularization by learning\ndomain-shared classifier and cluster centroids. By enriching the structural\nsimilarity assumption, we are able to extend H-SRDC for a pixel-level UDA task\nof semantic segmentation.

The lineup includes a model\nfor Bragg diffraction in crystal powders as well as one for incoherent elastic\nscattering, but the main focus is given to models of Bragg diffraction in\nideally imperfect single crystals: both for the most widely applicable model of\nisotropic Gaussian mosaicity, and for a more specific model of layered single\ncrystals which is relevant for materials such as pyrolytic graphite. Although\nthese single crystal models are utilising computationally efficient\napproximations where appropriate, attention is given to the provision of\nprecise and trustworthy results also for the extreme cases of back-scattering,\nforward-scattering, and crystals with very large mosaic spreads. Together with\nNCrystal's other features for crystal structure initialisation and inelastic\nphysics, the presented models enable realistic modelling of components at\nneutron scattering instruments in frameworks like Geant4 and McStas, including\nmonochromators, analysers, filters, support materials, shielding, and many\nkinds of samples.

Specifically, we introduce a\nconcept which we refer to as approximation spaces of artificial neural networks\nand we present several tools to handle those spaces. Roughly speaking,\napproximation spaces consist of sequences of functions which can, in a suitable\nway, be approximated by ANNs without curse of dimensionality in the sense that\nthe number of required ANN parameters to approximate a function of the sequence\nwith an accuracy $\\varepsilon > 0$ grows at most polynomially both in the\nreciprocal $1/\\varepsilon$ of the required accuracy and in the dimension $d \\in\n\\mathbb{N} = \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots \\}$ of the function.

In this paper, we propose a new DS paradigm--document-based\ndistant supervision, which models relation extraction as a document-based\nmachine reading comprehension (MRC) task. By re-organizing all sentences about\nan entity as a document and extracting relations via querying the document with\nrelation-specific questions, the document-based DS paradigm can simultaneously\nencode and exploit all sentence-level, inter-sentence-level, and entity-level\nevidence. Furthermore, we design a new loss function--DSLoss (distant\nsupervision loss), which can effectively train MRC models using only\n$\\langle$document, question, answer$\\rangle$ tuples, therefore noisy label\nproblem can be inherently resolved.

In this regard, Reading Articles Online, RAO, does differ\nsubstantially from the Online Knapsack Problem, but also has its similarities.\nUnder mild assumptions, we show that any $\\alpha$-competitive algorithm for the\nOnline Knapsack Problem in the random order model can be used as a black box to\nobtain an $(\\mathrm{e} + \\alpha)C$-competitive algorithm for RAO, where $C$\nmeasures the accuracy of the hints with respect to the information profiles of\nthe articles. Specifically, with the current best algorithm for Online\nKnapsack, which is $6.65<2.45\\mathrm{e}$-competitive, we obtain an upper bound\nof $3.45\\mathrm{e} C$ on the competitive ratio of RAO. Furthermore, we study a\nnatural algorithm that decides whether or not to read an article based on a\nsingle threshold value, which can serve as a model of human readers. We show\nthat this algorithmic technique is $O(C)$-competitive. Hence, our algorithms\nare constant-competitive whenever the accuracy $C$ is a constant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2020 10:31:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-09"}

This paper\npresents a method called k-Factorization Subspace Clustering (k-FSC) for\nlarge-scale subspace clustering. K-FSC directly factorizes the data into k\ngroups via pursuing structured sparsity in the matrix factorization model.\nThus, k-FSC avoids learning affinity matrix and performing eigenvalue\ndecomposition, and has low (linear) time and space complexity on large\ndatasets. This paper proves the effectiveness of the k-FSC model theoretically.\nAn efficient algorithm with convergence guarantee is proposed to solve the\noptimization of k-FSC. In addition, k-FSC is able to handle sparse noise,\noutliers, and missing data, which are pervasive in real applications. This\npaper also provides online extension and out-of-sample extension for k-FSC to\nhandle streaming data and cluster arbitrarily large datasets.

Most methods attempt to develop various region of interest (RoI)\noperations to concatenate the detection part and the sequence recognition part\ninto a two-stage text spotting framework. However, in such framework, the\nrecognition part is highly sensitive to the detected results (e.g.), the\ncompactness of text contours). To address this problem, in this paper, we\npropose a novel Mask AttentioN Guided One-stage text spotting framework named\nMANGO, in which character sequences can be directly recognized without RoI\noperation. Concretely, a position-aware mask attention module is developed to\ngenerate attention weights on each text instance and its characters. It allows\ndifferent text instances in an image to be allocated on different feature map\nchannels which are further grouped as a batch of instance features. Finally, a\nlightweight sequence decoder is applied to generate the character sequences. It\nis worth noting that MANGO inherently adapts to arbitrary-shaped text spotting\nand can be trained end-to-end with only coarse position information (e.g.),\nrectangular bounding box) and text annotations. Experimental results show that\nthe proposed method achieves competitive and even new state-of-the-art\nperformance on both regular and irregular text spotting benchmarks, i.e., ICDAR\n2013, ICDAR 2015, Total-Text, and SCUT-CTW1500.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2020 10:47:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 Oct 2021 09:32:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-26"}

In the case of small interacting systems, such as dark\nmatter and $e^+e^-$ annihilations or $pp$ collisions, the coalescence condition\nis often imposed only in momentum space and hence the size of the interaction\nregion is neglected. On the other hand, in most coalescence models used for\nheavy ion collisions, the coalescence probability is controlled mainly by the\nsize of the interaction region, while two-nucleon momentum correlations are\neither neglected or treated as collective flow. Recent experimental data from\n$pp$ collisions at LHC have been interpreted as evidence for such collective\nbehaviour, even in small interacting systems. We argue that these data are\nnaturally explained in the framework of conventional QCD inspired event\ngenerators when both two-nucleon momentum correlations and the size of the\nhadronic emission volume are taken into account.

We leverage a\nteacher-student mutual learning framework to propagate information from the\nlabeled to the unlabeled train set in the form of pseudo-labels.

We address this issue by an alternative two-step hedging\nprocedure, based on generalised regression arguments, which leads to portfolios\nthat are neutral with respect to a risk measure, such as Value-at-Risk or the\nexpectile. First, a portfolio of traded assets aimed at replicating the\nliability is determined by local quadratic hedging. Second, the residual\nliability is hedged using an alternative objective function. The risk margin is\nthen defined as the cost of the capital required to hedge the residual\nliability.

Because it requires taking both mechanical and\nimaging properties into account, the development of robust, calibrated phantoms\nis a major challenge in elastography. Soft polyvinyl chloride gels in a liquid\nplasticizer (plastisol or PVCP) have been proposed as soft tissue-mimicking\nphantoms (TMP) for elasticity imaging. PVCP phantoms are relatively low-cost\nand can be easily stored over long time periods without any specific\nrequirements. In this work, the preparation of a PVCP gel phantom for both MR\nand ultrasoundelastography is proposed and its acoustic, NMR and mechanical\nproperties are studied.Material and methods: The acoustic and magnetic\nresonance imaging properties of PVCP are measured for different mass ratios\nbetween ultrasound speckle particles and PVCP solution, and between resin and\nplasticizer. The linear mechanical properties of plastisol samples are then\ninvestigated over time using not only indentation tests, but also MR and\nultrasound-elastography clinical protocols. These properties are compared to\ntypical values reported for biological soft tissues and to the values found in\nthe literature for PVCP gels.Results and conclusions: After a period of two\nweeks, the mechanical properties of the plastisol samples measured with\nindentation testing are stable for at least the following 4 weeks (end of\nfollow-up period 43 days after gelation-fusion). Neither the mechanical nor the\nNMR properties of plastisol gels were found to be affected by the addition of\ncellulose as acoustic speckle. Mechanical properties of the proposed gels were\nsuccessfully characterized by clinical, commercially-available MR Elastography\nand sonoelastography protocols. PVCP with a mass ratio of ultrasound speckle\nparticles of 0.6% to 0.8% and a mass ratio between resin and plasticizer\nbetween 50 and 70% appears as a good TMP candidate that can be used with both\nMR and ultrasound-based elastography methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2020 11:22:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-09"}

We propose a receiver framework that enables\nefficient online training by leveraging the following simple observation:\nalthough NN parameters should adapt to channels, not all of them are\nchannel-sensitive. In particular, we use a deep unfolded NN structure that\nrepresents iterative algorithms in signal detection and channel decoding\nmodules as multi layer deep feed forward networks. An expectation propagation\n(EP) module, called EPNet, is established for signal detection by unfolding the\nEP algorithm and rendering the damping factors trainable. An unfolded turbo\ndecoding module, called TurboNet, is used for channel decoding. This component\ndecodes the turbo code, where trainable NN units are integrated into the\ntraditional max-log-maximum a posteriori decoding procedure. We demonstrate\nthat TurboNet is robust for channels and requires only one off-line training.\nTherefore, only a few damping factors in EPNet must be re-optimized online. An\nonline training mechanism based on meta learning is then developed. Here, the\noptimizer, which is implemented by long short-term memory NNs, is trained to\nupdate damping factors efficiently by using a small training set such that they\ncan quickly adapt to new environments. Simulation results indicate that the\nproposed receiver significantly outperforms traditional receivers and that the\nonline learning mechanism can quickly adapt to new environments. Furthermore,\nan over-the-air platform is presented to demonstrate the significant robustness\nof the proposed receiver in practical deployment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2020 11:50:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-09"}

The charge\ntransfer efficiency, xt, defined as the ratio between the flux of holes that\ncontribute to the water oxidation reaction and the total flux of holes that\nreach the surface, is an important parameter that helps to distinguish between\nbulk and surface recombination losses.

The analyses\ninclude projected density, phase-space diagrams, radial density and\npseudo-phase space density. Particular attention is paid to force and mass\nresolution. Because the phase-space sheet complexity, estimated in terms of\ntotal volume and simplices count, increases very quickly, ColDICE can follow\nonly the early violent relaxation phase of halo formation.

However,\ndespite the large number of variants that have been studied in the literature,\nmost packing problems encompass a single tier of capacity restrictions only.\nFor example, in the Multiple Knapsack Problem, we assign items to multiple\nknapsacks such that their capacities are not exceeded. But what if these\nknapsacks are partitioned into clusters, each imposing an additional capacity\nrestriction on the knapsacks contained in that cluster? In this paper, we study\nthe Maximum Coverage Problem with Cluster Constraints (MCPC), which generalizes\nthe Maximum Coverage Problem with Knapsack Constraints (MCPK) by incorporating\ncluster constraints. Our main contribution is a general LP-based technique to\nderive approximation algorithms for cluster capacitated problems. Our technique\nallows us to reduce the cluster capacitated problem to the respective original\npacking problem. By using an LP-based approximation algorithm for the original\nproblem, we can then obtain an effective rounding scheme for the problem, which\nonly loses a small fraction in the approximation guarantee. We apply our\ntechnique to derive approximation algorithms for MCPC.

In the current Part II we consider blow-up criteria and regularization\nphenomena. As in Part I we can allow nonlinearities with polynomial growth, and\nrough initial values from critical spaces.\n  In the first main result we obtain several new blow-up criteria for quasi-\nand semilinear stochastic evolution equations. In particular, for semilinear\nequations we obtain a Serrin type blow-up criterium, which extends a recent\nresult of Pr\\\"uss-Simonett-Wilke (2018) to the stochastic setting. Blow-up\ncriteria can be used to prove global well-posedness for SPDEs. As in Part I,\nmaximal regularity techniques and weights in time play a central role in the\nproofs.\n  Our second contribution is a new method to bootstrap Sobolev and H\\\"older\nregularity in time and space, which does not require smoothness of the initial\ndata. The blow-up criteria are at the basis of these new methods. Moreover, in\napplications the bootstrap results can be combined with our blow-up criteria,\nto obtain efficient ways to prove global existence. This gives new results even\nin classical $L^2$-settings, which we illustrate for a concrete SPDE.\n  In future works in preparation we apply the results of the current paper to\nobtain global well-posedness results, and regularity for several concrete\nSPDEs. These include stochastic Navier-Stokes, reaction diffusion equations,\nand Allen-Cahn equations. Our setting allows to put these SPDEs into a more\nflexible framework, where less restrictions on the nonlinearities are needed,\nand we are able to treat rough initial values from critical spaces. Moreover,\nwe will obtain higher order regularity results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2020 14:33:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Dec 2020 18:36:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 23 Apr 2021 13:04:38 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 29 Apr 2022 14:39:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-02"}

We find that, under the high-emissions scenario\nRCP8.5, the expected percent of customers experiencing at least one\nlonger-than-5-day hurricane-induced power outage in a 20-year period would\nincrease significantly from 14% at the end of the 20th century to 44% at the\nend of the 21st century in Harris County.

The control of the deposition process\ncurrently remains a major challenge as the selectivity of the no-growth areas\nis lost quickly. Here, we show that surface modifications of the substrate\nstrongly manipulate the surface diffusion. The selective deposition of TiO$_2$\non poly (methyl methacrylate) and SiO$_2$ yields localized nanostructures with\ntailored aspect ratios. Controlling the surface diffusion allows to tune such\nnanostructures as it boosts the growth rate at the interface of the growth and\nno-growth areas.

Several Bayesian learning based TDNN\nvariant systems are proposed to model the uncertainty over weight parameters\nand choices of hidden activation functions, or the hidden layer outputs.\nEfficient variational inference approaches using a few as one single parameter\nsample ensure their computational cost in both training and evaluation time\ncomparable to that of the baseline TDNN systems. Statistically significant word\nerror rate (WER) reductions of 0.4%-1.8% absolute (5%-11% relative) were\nobtained over a state-of-the-art 900 hour speed perturbed Switchboard corpus\ntrained baseline LF-MMI factored TDNN system using multiple regularization\nmethods including F-smoothing, L2 norm penalty, natural gradient, model\naveraging and dropout, in addition to i-Vector plus learning hidden unit\ncontribution (LHUC) based speaker adaptation and RNNLM rescoring. Consistent\nperformance improvements were also obtained on a 450 hour HKUST conversational\nMandarin telephone speech recognition task. On a third cross domain adaptation\ntask requiring rapidly porting a 1000 hour LibriSpeech data trained system to a\nsmall DementiaBank elderly speech corpus, the proposed Bayesian TDNN LF-MMI\nsystems outperformed the baseline system using direct weight fine-tuning by up\nto 2.5\\% absolute WER reduction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2020 15:32:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2020 04:43:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 10 May 2021 06:47:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-11"}

For\nexample, the principle of exploiting sparse optimization such as compressive\nsensing to find the equations of nonlinear dynamical systems from data was\narticulated in 2011 by the Nonlinear Dynamics Group at Arizona State\nUniversity. This article presents a brief review of the recent progress in this\narea.

For each design iteration, exploration is done by randomly\nselecting evaluation points within regions where the weak learner-predicted\nfitness is high.

In\nremote sensing and geosciences this is of special relevance to better\nunderstand the Earth's system and the complex interactions between the\ngoverning processes. In this paper, we focus on observational causal inference,\nthus we try to estimate the correct direction of causation using a finite set\nof empirical data. In addition, we focus on the more complex bivariate scenario\nthat requires strong assumptions and no conditional independence tests can be\nused. In particular, we explore the framework of (non-deterministic) additive\nnoise models, which relies on the principle of independence between the cause\nand the generating mechanism. A practical algorithmic instantiation of such\nprinciple only requires 1) two regression models in the forward and backward\ndirections, and 2) the estimation of {\\em statistical independence} between the\nobtained residuals and the observations. The direction leading to more\nindependent residuals is decided to be the cause. We instead propose a\ncriterion that uses the {\\em sensitivity} (derivative) of the dependence\nestimator, the sensitivity criterion allows to identify samples most affecting\nthe dependence measure, and hence the criterion is robust to spurious\ndetections. We illustrate performance in a collection of 28 geoscience causal\ninference problems, in a database of radiative transfer models simulations and\nmachine learning emulators in vegetation parameter modeling involving 182\nproblems, and in assessing the impact of different regression models in a\ncarbon cycle problem.

The proposed method is based on an\nanalogy between electrostatics of conductors and open cosmological models which\nhave a conformally-flat 4-metric in the Fock form. These cosmological models\nare solutions of the Einstein equations with the energy-momentum tensor of a\nPascal perfect fluid. As a result, it is shown that the capacity of the\nmultidimensional \"ball\" electric capacitor in multidimensional Euclidean\nauxiliary space is connected with harmonic functions by which the potentials of\nmultidimensional capacitors are described. In turn, the conformal factor of the\nmetric describing an open universe model in the Fock representation is a power\nfunction of this potential for each dimensionality of the Euclidean space. In\nparticular, for 3D auxiliary Euclidean space in 4D space-time, there is the\nFriedman solution for an open universe filled with incoherent dust (with flat\nmetric at spatial infinity). Further for 4D Euclidean space, we have an\nanalogue of the open cosmological model with the equation of state of an\nultra-relativistic gas. Other cases are listed in a table. A table of the\nmatter states which generalizes this approach to multidimensional space-times\nis also constructed. Thus, the possibility of replacing the modelling problem\nin cosmology with the equivalent electrostatic problem for finding the capacity\nof capacitors is shown under specified boundary conditions.
