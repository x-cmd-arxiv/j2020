Population Monte Carlo (PMC)\nis an important class of Monte Carlo methods, which utilizes a population of\nproposals to generate weighted samples that approximate the target\ndistribution. The generic PMC framework iterates over three steps: samples are\nsimulated from a set of proposals, weights are assigned to such samples to\ncorrect for mismatch between the proposal and target distributions, and the\nproposals are then adapted via resampling from the weighted samples. When the\ntarget distribution is expensive to evaluate, the PMC has its computational\nlimitation since the convergence rate is $\\mathcal{O}(N^{-1/2})$. To address\nthis, we propose in this paper a new Population Quasi-Monte Carlo (PQMC)\nframework, which integrates Quasi-Monte Carlo ideas within the sampling and\nadaptation steps of PMC. A key novelty in PQMC is the idea of importance\nsupport points resampling, a deterministic method for finding an \"optimal\"\nsubsample from the weighted proposal samples. Moreover, within the PQMC\nframework, we develop an efficient covariance adaptation strategy for\nmultivariate normal proposals. Lastly, a new set of correction weights is\nintroduced for the weighted PMC estimator to improve the efficiency from the\nstandard PMC estimator. We demonstrate the improved empirical convergence of\nPQMC over PMC in extensive numerical simulations and a friction drilling\napplication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Dec 2020 16:10:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-30"}

We consider four types of IRSs, namely 1) active\nIRSs, which are able to amplify, attenuate, and add a phase shift to the\nreceived signal, 2) passive IRSs, which are able to attenuate and add a phase\nshift to the received signal, 3) passive lossless IRSs, which are only able to\nadd a phase shift to the received signal, and 4) $\\varepsilon$-relaxed passive\nlossless IRSs, which are able to scale the received signal by a number between\n$1-\\varepsilon$ and $1$ in addition to adding a phase shift. We derive inner\nand outer bounds for the DoF region and lower and upper bounds for the sum DoF\nof the $K$-user interference channel in the presence of an active IRS and prove\nthat the maximum value $K$ for the sum DoF can be achieved if the number of IRS\nelements exceeds a certain finite value.

In particular, the rare-earth ions play\na direct decisive role unlike in many other well known multiferroic materials\nand there appears to be a critical canting angle, developing below TN2,\nsubtended by Tb 4f and Ni 3d moments to trigger this cross coupling phenomenon.\nHowever, for a small replacement of Sr for Ba, viz. in Tb2Ba0.9Sr0.1NiO5,\nferroelectricity was reported to get destroyed, but retaining magnetic features\nat (TN1) 55 K and (TN2) 14 K. In this article, we address the origin of\nsuppression of multiferrocity in this Sr doped system through neutron\ndiffraction studies and density functional theory calculations. We find that,\nunlike in Tb2BaNiO5, there is no pronounced change in the relative canting\nangle of the magnetic moments around TN2 and that the absolute value of this\nparameter down to 2 K fails to exceed the critical value noted for the parent,\nthereby explaining the origin of destruction of magnetoelectric coupling in the\nSr doped material.

The method is parametrization free, requires no\nknowledge regarding the manifold's intrinsic dimension, can handle noise and\noutliers in both the function values and in the location of the data, and is\napplied directly in the high dimensions. We show that the complexity of the\nmethod is linear in the dimension of the manifold and squared-logarithmic in\nthe dimension of the codomain of the function. Subsequently, we demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our approach by considering different manifold topologies and\nshow the robustness of the method to various noise levels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Dec 2020 19:56:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-29"}

They usually impose\nstrong assumptions on treatment assignment or outcome model to obtain unbiased\nestimation, such as linearity or specific functional forms, which easily leads\nto the major drawback of model mis-specification. In this paper, we aim to\nalleviate these issues by developing a distribution learning-based weighting\nmethod. We first learn the true underlying distribution of covariates\nconditioned on treatment assignment, then leverage the ratio of covariates'\ndensity in the treatment group to that of the control group as the weight for\nestimating treatment effects. Specifically, we propose to approximate the\ndistribution of covariates in both treatment and control groups through\ninvertible transformations via change of variables. To demonstrate the\nsuperiority, robustness, and generalizability of our method, we conduct\nextensive experiments using synthetic and real data. From the experiment\nresults, we find that our method for estimating average treatment effect on\ntreated (ATT) with observational data outperforms several cutting-edge\nweighting-only benchmarking methods, and it maintains its advantage under a\ndoubly-robust estimation framework that combines weighting with some advanced\noutcome modeling methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Dec 2020 20:15:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Jan 2021 18:36:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 6 Jan 2021 04:23:34 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 8 May 2023 15:57:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-09"}

Field-based coordination is one such approach, promoting the idea\nof programming system coordination declaratively from a global perspective, in\nterms of functional manipulation and evolution in \"space and time\" of\ndistributed data structures called fields. More specifically regarding time, in\nfield-based coordination (as in many other distributed approaches to\ncoordination) it is assumed that local activities in each device are regulated\nby a fair and unsynchronised fixed clock working at the platform level. In this\nwork, we challenge this assumption, and propose an alternative approach where\nscheduling is programmed in a natural way (along with usual field-based\ncoordination) in terms of causality fields, each enacting a programmable\ndistributed notion of a computation \"cause\" (why and when a field computation\nhas to be locally computed) and how it should change across time and space.\nStarting from low-level platform triggers, such causality fields can be\norganised into multiple layers, up to high-level, collectively-computed time\nabstractions, to be used at the application level. This reinterpretation of\ntime in terms of articulated causality relations allows us to express what we\ncall \"time-fluid\" coordination, where scheduling can be finely tuned so as to\nselect the triggers to react to, generally allowing to adaptively balance\nperformance (system reactivity) and cost (resource usage) of computations. We\nformalise the proposed scheduling framework for field-based coordination in the\ncontext of the field calculus, discuss an implementation in the aggregate\ncomputing framework, and finally evaluate the approach via simulation on\nseveral case studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Dec 2020 20:24:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 May 2021 17:09:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 4 Jun 2021 08:46:10 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 29 Sep 2021 12:21:45 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Wed, 24 Nov 2021 18:52:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-11"}

The distortion and tilting of the BO6 octahedra has been\nstudied as a function of different Fe:Mn content and expressed by Glazer\nrepresentation from the refined Crystallographic Information Files (CIF). The\nangle of tilting from the central non-tilted position also shows a correlated\nmodification with the phase transformation. The valence state and size of\ncations influences the octahedral tilting. Octahedral volume is reduced as the\nentire perovskite structure is relatively flattened with increasing Mn-content\nimplying a flattening of both the BO6 octahedra and the La8O6 cage.

Loshchilov et al.\nshow that for adaptive optimizers, manually decaying weights can outperform\nadding an $l_2$ penalty to the loss. This technique has become increasingly\npopular and is referred to as decoupled WD. The goal of this paper is to\ninvestigate these two recent empirical observations. We demonstrate that by\napplying WD only at the start, the network norm stays small throughout\ntraining. This has a regularizing effect as the effective gradient updates\nbecome larger. However, traditional generalizations metrics fail to capture\nthis effect of WD, and we show how a simple scale-invariant metric can. We also\nshow how the growth of network weights is heavily influenced by the dataset and\nits generalization properties. For decoupled WD, we perform experiments in NLP\nand RL where adaptive optimizers are the norm. We demonstrate that the primary\nissue that decoupled WD alleviates is the mixing of gradients from the\nobjective function and the $l_2$ penalty in the buffers of Adam (which stores\nthe estimates of the first-order moment). Adaptivity itself is not problematic\nand decoupled WD ensures that the gradients from the $l_2$ term cannot \"drown\nout\" the true objective, facilitating easier hyperparameter tuning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Dec 2020 00:59:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-29"}

For any given $n\\geq 3$, if such a\nconstraint is imposed on the encoding scheme of the random-access code, then\nthe local bound of the Bell expression reduces to the preparation\nnon-contextual bound. We provide explicit examples for $n=4,5$ case to\ndemonstrate that the relevant Bell expressions certify the qubit and two-qubit\nsystem, and for $n=6$ case, the relevant Bell expression certifies the qubit,\ntwo-qubit and three-qubit systems. We further demonstrate the sharing of\nquantum preparation contextuality by multiple Bobs sequentially to examine\nwhether number of Bobs sharing the preparation contextuality is dependent on\nthe dimension of the system. We provide explicit example of $n=5$ and $6$ to\ndemonstrate that number of Bobs sequentially sharing the contextuality remains\nsame for any of the $2^{m}$ dimensional systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Dec 2020 06:40:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-29"}

Existing residual networks based\non an additive model require residual layers with a small output range for fast\nconvergence and visual quality improvement. However, in inverse halftoning,\nhomogenous dot patterns hinder a small output range from the residual layers.\nTherefore, a new layer decomposition network based on the Gaussian convolution\nmodel (GCM) and structure-aware deblurring strategy is presented to achieve\nresidual learning for both the base and detail layers. For the base layer, a\nnew GCM-based residual subnetwork is presented. The GCM utilizes a statistical\ndistribution, in which the image difference between a blurred continuous-tone\nimage and a blurred halftoned image with a Gaussian filter can result in a\nnarrow output range. Subsequently, the GCM-based residual subnetwork uses a\nGaussian-filtered halftoned image as input and outputs the image difference as\nresidual, thereby generating the base layer, i.e., the Gaussian-blurred\ncontinuous-tone image. For the detail layer, a new structure-aware residual\ndeblurring subnetwork (SARDS) is presented. To remove the Gaussian blurring of\nthe base layer, the SARDS uses the predicted base layer as input and outputs\nthe deblurred version. To more effectively restore image structures such as\nlines and texts, a new image structure map predictor is incorporated into the\ndeblurring network to induce structure-adaptive learning. This paper provides a\nmethod to realize the residual learning of both the base and detail layers\nbased on the GCM and SARDS. In addition, it is verified that the proposed\nmethod surpasses state-of-the-art methods based on U-Net, direct deblurring\nnetworks, and progressively residual networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Dec 2020 09:15:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 7 Feb 2021 14:04:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-09"}

This paper considers the uplink of a cell-free mMIMO system\nutilizing the radio stripe network architecture with a sequential fronthaul\nbetween the APs. A novel uplink sequential processing algorithm is developed\nwhich is proved to be optimal in both the maximum spectral efficiency (SE) and\nthe minimum mean square error (MSE) sense.

In this context, a convenient choice for approximate inference is\nvariational inference (VI), where the problem of Bayesian inference is cast as\nan optimization problem -- namely, to maximize a lower bound of the log\nmarginal likelihood. This paves the way for a powerful and versatile framework,\nwhere pseudo-training examples are treated as optimization arguments of the\napproximate posterior that are jointly identified together with hyperparameters\nof the generative model (i.e. prior and likelihood). The framework can\nnaturally handle a wide scope of supervised learning problems, ranging from\nregression with heteroscedastic and non-Gaussian likelihoods to classification\nproblems with discrete labels, but also problems with multidimensional labels.\nThe purpose of this tutorial is to provide access to the basic matter for\nreaders without prior knowledge in both GPs and VI. A proper exposition to the\nsubject enables also access to more recent advances (like importance-weighted\nVI as well as interdomain, multioutput and deep GPs) that can serve as an\ninspiration for new research ideas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Dec 2020 15:25:13 GMT"},{"version":"v10","created":"Fri, 11 Jun 2021 23:39:42 GMT"},{"version":"v11","created":"Fri, 2 Jul 2021 23:06:11 GMT"},{"version":"v12","created":"Sun, 4 Sep 2022 21:13:29 GMT"},{"version":"v13","created":"Sun, 4 Dec 2022 18:26:02 GMT"},{"version":"v14","created":"Sun, 18 Dec 2022 10:48:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Dec 2020 12:25:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 3 Jan 2021 17:18:26 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 08:44:30 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 15 Jan 2021 09:58:34 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 11:51:16 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 2021 17:02:43 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Fri, 16 Apr 2021 11:21:38 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Wed, 2 Jun 2021 19:29:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-21"}

The underlying assumption\nfor using LSTM networks for malware-detection is that the op-code sequence of\nmalware could be treated as a (spoken) language representation. There are\ndifferences between any spoken-language (sequence of words/sentences) and the\nmachine-language (sequence of op-codes). In this paper, we demonstrate that due\nto these inherent differences, an LSTM model with its default configuration as\ntuned for a spoken-language, may not work well to detect malware (using its\nop-code sequence) unless the network's essential hyper-parameters are tuned\nappropriately. In the process, we also determine the relative importance of all\nthe different hyper-parameters of an LSTM network as applied to malware\ndetection using their op-code sequence representations. We experimented with\ndifferent configurations of LSTM networks, and altered hyper-parameters like\nthe embedding-size, number of hidden layers, number of LSTM-units in a hidden\nlayer, pruning/padding-length of the input-vector, activation-function, and\nbatch-size.

Also, for (spoken) language-modeling, the recurrent\narchitectures by-far outperform their non-recurrent counterparts. Therefore, we\nalso assess how sequential DL architectures like the LSTM compare against their\nnon-sequential counterparts like the MLP-DNN for the purpose of\nmalware-detection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 26 Dec 2020 18:00:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-01"}

Given a homogeneous fleet of vehicles M, the goal is to find up to m\n= |M| disjoint routes (from an origin vertex to a destination one) that\nmaximize the total sum of rewards collected while satisfying a given limit on\nthe route's duration. Naturally, all mandatory vertices must be visited. In\nthis work, we show that solely finding a feasible solution for STOP is NP-hard\nand propose a Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) heuristic for the problem. The\nalgorithm is provided with initial solutions obtained by means of the\nmatheuristic framework known as Feasibility Pump (FP). In our implementation,\nFP uses as backbone a commodity-based formulation reinforced by three classes\nof valid inequalities. To our knowledge, two of them are also introduced in\nthis work. The LNS heuristic itself combines classical local searches from the\nliterature of routing problems with a long-term memory component based on Path\nRelinking. We use the primal bounds provided by a state-of-the-art\ncutting-plane algorithm from the literature to evaluate the quality of the\nsolutions obtained by the heuristic. Computational experiments show the\nefficiency and effectiveness of the proposed heuristic in solving a benchmark\nof 387 instances. Overall, the heuristic solutions imply an average percentage\ngap of only 0.54% when compared to the bounds of the cutting-plane baseline. In\nparticular, the heuristic reaches the best previously known bounds on 382 of\nthe 387 instances. Additionally, in 21 of these cases, our heuristic is even\nable to improve over the best known bounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 27 Dec 2020 00:33:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-06"}

We offer a\ngrassroots approach to operational ethics based on dialog and mutualised\nresponsibility. This methodology is centred around conversations intended to\nelicit practitioners perceived ethical attribution and distribution over key\nvalue laden operational decisions, to identify when these decisions arise and\nwhat ethical challenges they confront, and to engage in a language of ethics\nand responsibility which enables practitioners to internalise ethical\nresponsibility. The methodology bridges responsibility imbalances that rest in\nstructural decision making power and elite technical knowledge, by commencing\nwith personal, facilitated conversations, returning the ethical discourse to\nthose meant to give it meaning at the sharp end of the ecosystem.

It is difficult to evaluate the configuration\nskills of the students in the classroom, particularly during laboratory class,\nwhile teaching networking course, the most problems for lecturers. The\nmulti-user functionality that uses the one-to-many remote relay server concept\nallows lecturers to remotely control and test many students at one time. The\nkey purpose of this paper is to incorporate creativity in teaching by using\nrealistic multi-user practises in the networking class. In this study, the\nmultiuser operation was developed and used via an existing LAN link in the\nclassroom. The focus of the operation is the simple configuration of network\nequipment such as routers and switches. This practise was used during the\nlaboratory session, encouraging lecturers to establish relationships based on a\nlarge audience. The professor is able to evaluate the success of the students\nduring the execution of the activity and to ensure that each student engages in\nthe activity. As a result of introducing this approach, the curiosity of\nstudents in technical subjects can be improved and student success can be\nconveniently tracked on the part of the lecturer. Lecturers are able to monitor\nthe configuration capabilities of students closely to ensure that each student\nengages in the laboratory class.

In contrast to the Kalman and particle\nfilters, which respectively require state update equations and a map of one\nphysical quality, our algorithm requires only the oversampled sensor\nmeasurements. When applied to temperature-compensated humidity sensors, it\nprovides reduced uncertainty in humidity estimates from correlated temperature\nand humidity measurements. In an experimental evaluation, the algorithm\nachieves average uncertainty reduction of 10.3 %. The algorithm incurs an\nexecution time overhead of 5.3 % when compared to the minimum algorithm\nrequired to measure and calculate the uncertainty.
