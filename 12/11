The proposed influence-driven explanations (IDXs) for BCs are\nsystematically generated using the causal relationships between variables\nwithin the BC, called influences, which are then categorised by logical\nrequirements, called relation properties, according to their behaviour. These\nrelation properties both provide guarantees beyond heuristic explanation\nmethods and allow the information underpinning an explanation to be tailored to\na particular context's and user's requirements, e.g., IDXs may be dialectical\nor counterfactual. We demonstrate IDXs' capability to explain various forms of\nBCs, e.g., naive or multi-label, binary or categorical, and also integrate\nrecent approaches to explanations for BCs from the literature.

Motivated by\nreal-world problems, such as, e.g., long-term rental of rooms and apartments,\nwe assume that customers arrive online according to a Poisson process, and\ntheir valuations are drawn from an unknown distribution and discounted over\ntime. We evaluate our mechanisms in terms of competitive ratio, measuring the\nworst-case ratio between their revenue and that of an optimal mechanism that\nknows the distribution of valuations. First, we focus on the identical\nvaluation setting, where all the customers value the item for the same amount.\nIn this setting, we provide a mechanism M_c that achieves the best possible\ncompetitive ratio, discussing its dependency on the parameters in the case of\nlinear discount. Then, we switch to the random valuation setting. We show that,\nif we restrict the attention to distributions of valuations with a monotone\nhazard rate, then the competitive ratio of M_c is lower bounded by a strictly\npositive constant that does not depend on the distribution. Moreover, we\nprovide another mechanism, called M_pc, which is defined by a piecewise\nconstant pricing strategy and reaches performances comparable to those obtained\nwith M_c. This mechanism is useful when the seller cannot change the posted\nprice too often. Finally, we empirically evaluate the performances of our\nmechanisms in a number of experimental settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Dec 2020 16:01:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-11"}

In this paper, we first\npoint out that one-to-one positive sample assignment is the key factor, while,\none-to-many assignment in previous detectors causes redundant predictions in\ninference. Second, we surprisingly find that even training with one-to-one\nassignment, previous detectors still produce redundant predictions.

We introduce the concept of score gap to explore\nthe effect of matching cost. Classification cost enlarges the score gap by\nchoosing positive samples as those of highest score in the training iteration\nand reducing noisy positive samples brought by only location cost.

We develop spherically\nsymmetric time-dependent and steady-state hydrodynamical models of the\nradiation-driven wind outflows and associated mass loss from classical WR\nstars. The simulations are based on combining the opacities typically used in\nstatic stellar structure and evolution models with a simple parametrised form\nfor the enhanced line-opacity expected within a supersonic outflow. Our\nsimulations reveal high mass-loss rates initiated in deep and hot optically\nthick layers around T\\approx 200kK. The resulting velocity structure is\nnon-monotonic and can be separated into three phases: i) an initial\nacceleration to supersonic speeds ii) stagnation and even deceleration, and\niii) an outer region of rapid re-acceleration. The characteristic structures\nseen in converged steady-state simulations agree well with the outflow\nproperties of our time-dependent models. By directly comparing our dynamic\nsimulations to corresponding hydrostatic models, we demonstrate explicitly that\nthe need to invoke extra energy transport in convectively inefficient regions\nof stellar structure and evolution models is merely an artefact of enforcing a\nhydrostatic outer boundary. Moreover, the \"dynamically inflated\" inner regions\nof our simulations provide a natural explanation for the often-found mismatch\nbetween predicted hydrostatic WR radii and those inferred from spectroscopy.\nFinally, we contrast our simulations with alternative recent WR wind models\nbased on co-moving frame radiative transfer for computing the radiation force.\nSince CMF transfer currently cannot handle non-monotonic velocity fields, the\ncharacteristic deceleration regions found here are avoided in such simulations\nby invoking an ad-hoc very high degree of clumping.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Dec 2020 16:53:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-31"}

The subset of pure\nstates is then characterized within this domain structure. After having\nspecified the notions of properties and measurements, we explore the notion of\ncompatibility between measurements and of minimally disturbing measurements. We\nachieve the characterization of the domain structure on the space of states by\nrequiring the existence of a scheme of discriminating yes/no tests, necessary\ncondition for the construction of an orthogonality relation on the space of\nstates. This last requirement about the space of states constrain the\ncorresponding projective domain to be ortho-complemented. An orthogonality\nrelation is then defined on the space of states and its properties are studied.\nEquipped with this relation, the ortho-poset of ortho-closed subsets of pure\nstates inherits naturally a structure of Hilbert lattice. Finally, the\nsymmetries of the system are characterized as a general subclass of Chu\nmorphisms.

In this work, we reformulate the algorithm to ensure that EwDMET can\nbe considered equivalent to an optimal and rigorous truncation of the\nself-consistent dynamics of dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). A practical\nlimitation of these quantum embedding approaches is often a numerical fitting\nof a self-consistent object defining the quantum effects. However, we show here\nthat in this formulation, all numerical fitting steps can be entirely\ncircumvented, via an effective Dyson equation in the space of truncated\ndynamics. This provides a robust and analytic self-consistency for the method,\nand an ability to systematically and rigorously converge to DMFT from a static,\nwave function perspective. We demonstrate that this improved approach can solve\nthe correlated dynamics and phase transitions of the Bethe lattice Hubbard\nmodel in infinite dimensions, as well as one- and two-dimensional Hubbard\nmodels where we clearly show the benefits of this rapidly convergent basis for\ncorrelation-driven fluctuations.

There is\nobservational evidence of energy injection into the halo from past activity in\nthe nucleus of the Milky Way; however, the origin of this energy (star\nformation or supermassive-black-hole activity) is uncertain, and the causal\nconnection between nuclear structures and large-scale features has not been\nestablished unequivocally. Here we report soft-X-ray-emitting bubbles that\nextend approximately 14 kiloparsecs above and below the Galactic centre and\ninclude a structure in the southern sky analogous to the North Polar Spur. The\nsharp boundaries of these bubbles trace collisionless and non-radiative shocks,\nand corroborate the idea that the bubbles are not a remnant of a local\nsupernova but part of a vast Galaxy-scale structure closely related to features\nseen in gamma-rays. Large energy injections from the Galactic centre are the\nmost likely cause of both the {\\gamma}-ray and X-ray bubbles. The latter have\nan estimated energy of around 10$^{56}$ erg, which is sufficient to perturb the\nstructure, energy content and chemical enrichment of the circumgalactic medium\nof the Milky Way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Dec 2020 17:31:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-11"}

The formal\ndefinition of this coupled system as a probabilistic graphical model enables us\nto draw upon well-established theory and methods from Bayesian statistics,\ndynamical systems, and control theory. The declarative and general nature of\nthe proposed digital twin model make it rigorous yet flexible, enabling its\napplication at scale in a diverse range of application areas. We demonstrate\nhow the model is instantiated to enable a structural digital twin of an\nunmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The digital twin is calibrated using\nexperimental data from a physical UAV asset. Its use in dynamic decision making\nis then illustrated in a synthetic example where the UAV undergoes an in-flight\ndamage event and the digital twin is dynamically updated using sensor data.

The model is based on the assumption that the ambient solar\nwind interacts with the interplanetary CME (ICME) resulting in constant\nacceleration or deceleration. The upgraded version of the model (EAMv3),\npresented here, incorporates two basic improvements: (a) a new technique for\nthe calculation of the acceleration (or deceleration) of the ICME from the Sun\nto 1 AU and (b) a correction for the CME plane-of-sky speed. A validation of\nthe upgraded EAM model is performed via comparisons to predictions from the\nensemble version of the Drag-Based model (DBEM) and the WSA-ENLIL+Cone ensemble\nmodel. A common sample of 16 CMEs/ICMEs, in 2013-2014, is used for the\ncomparison. Basic performance metrics such as the mean absolute error (MAE),\nmean error (ME) and root mean squared error (RMSE) between observed and\npredicted values of ToA are presented. MAE for EAM model was 8.7$\\pm$1.6 hours\nwhile for DBEM and ENLIL was 14.3$\\pm$2.2 and 12.8$\\pm$1.7 hours, respectively.\nME for EAM was -1.4$\\pm$2.7 hours in contrast with -9.7$\\pm$3.4 and\n-6.1$\\pm$3.3 hours from DBEM and ENLIL.

Compared with physical\nattacks that place hand-crafted adversarial objects, projector-based ones\nobviate modifying the physical entities, and can be performed transiently and\ndynamically by altering the projection pattern. However, subtle light\nperturbations are insufficient to fool image classifiers, due to the complex\nenvironment and project-and-capture process. Thus, existing approaches focus on\nprojecting clearly perceptible adversarial patterns, while the more interesting\nyet challenging goal, stealthy projector-based attack, remains open. In this\npaper, for the first time, we formulate this problem as an end-to-end\ndifferentiable process and propose a Stealthy Projector-based Adversarial\nAttack (SPAA) solution. In SPAA, we approximate the real Project-and-Capture\nprocess using a deep neural network named PCNet, then we include PCNet in the\noptimization of projector-based attacks such that the generated adversarial\nprojection is physically plausible. Finally, to generate both robust and\nstealthy adversarial projections, we propose an algorithm that uses minimum\nperturbation and adversarial confidence thresholds to alternate between the\nadversarial loss and stealthiness loss optimization. Our experimental\nevaluations show that SPAA clearly outperforms other methods by achieving\nhigher attack success rates and meanwhile being stealthier, for both targeted\nand untargeted attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Dec 2020 18:14:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Jan 2022 04:48:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 17 Mar 2022 15:33:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-26"}

The elements of the\nunderlying lifted analysis domain are tuples, which maintain one property per\nvariant. Still, explicit property enumeration in tuples, one by one for all\nvariants, immediately yields combinatorial explosion. This is particularly\napparent in the case of program families that, apart from Boolean features,\ncontain also numerical features with big domains, thus admitting astronomic\nconfiguration spaces.\n  The key for an efficient lifted analysis is proper handling of\nvariability-specific constructs of the language (e.g., feature-based runtime\ntests and #if directives). In this work, we introduce a new symbolic\nrepresentation of the lifted abstract domain that can efficiently analyze\nprogram families with numerical features. This makes sharing between property\nelements corresponding to different variants explicitly possible. The elements\nof the new lifted domain are constraint-based decision trees, where decision\nnodes are labeled with linear constraints defined over numerical features and\nthe leaf nodes belong to an existing single-program analysis domain. To\nillustrate the potential of this representation, we have implemented an\nexperimental lifted static analyzer, called SPLNUM^2Analyzer, for inferring\ninvariants of C programs. It uses existing numerical domains (e.g., intervals,\noctagons, polyhedra) from the APRON library as parameters. An empirical\nevaluation on benchmarks from SV-COMP and BusyBox yields promising preliminary\nresults indicating that our decision trees-based approach is effective and\noutperforms the tuple-based approach, which is used as a baseline lifted\nanalysis based on abstract interpretation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Dec 2020 18:21:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-11"}

The Small Magellanic\nCloud (SMC) is a unique laboratory to study this because of its metallicity of\n0.2 Zsol, its proximity, and because it is currently forming stars. We used a\nspectral type catalog in combination with GAIA magnitudes to calculate\ntemperatures and luminosities of bright SMC stars. By comparing these with\nliterature studies, we tested the validity of our method, and using GAIA data,\nwe estimated the completeness of stars in the catalog as a function of\nluminosity. This allowed us to obtain a nearly complete view of the most\nluminous stars in the SMC. When then compared with stellar evolution\npredictions. We also calculated the extinction distribution, the ionizing\nphoton production rate, and the star formation rate. Our results imply that the\nSMS hosts only 30 very luminous main-sequence stars (M > 40 Msol; L > 10^5\nLsol), which are far fewer than expected from the number of stars in the\nluminosity range 3*10^4 < L/Lsol < 3*10^5 and from the typically quoted star\nformation rate in the SMC. Even more striking, we find that for masses above M\n> 20 Msol, stars in the first half of their hydrogen-burning phase are almost\nabsent. This mirrors a qualitatively similar peculiarity that is known for the\nMilky Way and Large Magellanic Cloud. This amounts to a lack of\nhydrogen-burning counterparts of helium-burning stars, which is more pronounced\nfor higher luminosities. We argue that a declining star formation rate or a\nsteep initial mass function are unlikely to be the sole explanations for the\ndearth of young bright stars. Instead, many of these stars might be embedded in\ntheir birth clouds, although observational evidence for this is weak. We\ndiscuss implications for cosmic reionization and the top end of the initial\nmass function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Dec 2020 18:13:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-17"}

Here, we derive some general constraints on superconductivity in\ntwisted bilayer graphene (TBG), independent of its underlying mechanism.\nNeglecting weak coupling between valleys, the global symmetry group of TBG\nconsists of independent spin rotations in each valley in addition to valley\ncharge rotations, $ {\\rm SU}(2) \\times {\\rm SU}(2) \\times {\\rm U}_V(1) $. This\nsymmetry is further enhanced to a full ${\\rm SU}(4)$ in the idealized chiral\nlimit. In both cases, we show that any charge $2e$ pairing must break the\nglobal symmetry. Additionally, if the pairing is unitary the resulting\nsuperconductor admits fractional vortices. This leads to the following general\nstatement: Any superconducting condensate in either symmetry class has to\nsatisfy one of three possibilities: (i) the superconducting pairing is\nnon-unitary, (ii) the superconducting condensate has charge $2e$ but admits at\nleast half quantum vortices which carry a flux of $h/4e$, or (iii) the\nsuperconducting condensate has charge $2me$, $m>1$, with vortices carrying\n$h/2me$ flux. The latter possibility can be realized by a symmetric charge $4e$\nsuperconductor ($m=2$). Non-unitary pairing (i) is expected in TBG for\nsuperconductors observed in the vicinity of flavor polarized states. On the\nother hand, in the absence of flavor polarization, e.g. in the vicinity of\ncharge neutrality, one of the two exotic possibilities (ii) and (iii) is\nexpected. We sketch how all three scenarios can be realized in different limits\nwithin a strong coupling theory of superconductivity based on skyrmions.\nFinally we discuss the effect of symmetry lowering anisotropies and\nexperimental implications of these scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Dec 2020 19:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-14"}

In this study, we constrain the 2D thermal structure of the\nprotoplanetary disk TW Hya structure utilizing images of seven CO lines. This\nincludes new ALMA observations of 12CO J=2-1 and C18O J=2-1 as well as archival\nALMA observations of 12CO J=3-2, 13CO J=3-2, 6-5, C18O J= 3-2, 6-5.\nAdditionally, we reproduce a Herschel observation of the HD J=1-0 line flux,\nthe spectral energy distribution, and utilize a recent quantification of CO\nradial depletion in TW Hya. These observations were modeled using the\nthermochemical code RAC2D, and our best fit model reproduces all spatially\nresolved CO surface brightness profiles. The resulting thermal profile finds a\ndisk mass of 0.025 Msun and a thin upper layer of gas depleted of small dust\nwith a thickness of approx 1.2% of the corresponding radius. Using our final\nthermal structure, we find that CO alone is not a viable mass tracer as its\nabundance is degenerate with the total H2 surface density. Different mass\nmodels can readily match the spatially resolved CO line profiles with disparate\nabundance assumptions. Mass determination requires additional knowledge and, in\nthis work, HD provides the additional constraint to derive the gas mass and\nsupports the inference of CO depletion in the TW Hya disk. Our final thermal\nstructure confirms the use of HD as a powerful probe of protoplanetary disk\nmass. Additionally, the method laid out in this paper is an employable strategy\nfor extraction of disk temperatures and masses in the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 10 Dec 2020 19:00:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-17"}

The key is to leverage a well-trained graph neural network (GNN) to\nidentify all the gates in a given locked netlist that belong to the targeted\nprotection logic, without requiring an oracle. This approach fits perfectly\nwith the targeted problem since a circuit is a graph with an inherent structure\nand the protection logic is a sub-graph of nodes (gates) with specific and\ncommon characteristics. GNNs are powerful in capturing the nodes' neighborhood\nproperties, facilitating the detection of the protection logic. To rectify any\nmisclassifications induced by the GNN, we additionally propose a connectivity\nanalysis-based post-processing algorithm to successfully remove the predicted\nprotection logic, thereby retrieving the original design. Our extensive\nexperimental evaluation demonstrates that GNNUnlock is 99.24%-100% successful\nin breaking various benchmarks locked using stripped-functionality logic\nlocking, tenacious and traceless logic locking, and Anti-SAT. Our proposed\npost-processing enhances the detection accuracy, reaching 100% for all of our\ntested locked benchmarks. Analysis of the results corroborates that GNNUnlock\nis powerful enough to break the considered schemes under different parameters,\nsynthesis settings, and technology nodes.

Apart from minutiae and ridge patterns,\npore features have proven to be usable for fingerprint recognition.

To find a solution for recovering pore information from low-resolution\nfingerprints, we adopt a joint learning-based approach that combines both\nsuper-resolution and pore detection networks. Our modified single image\nSuper-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) framework helps to\nreliably reconstruct high-resolution fingerprint samples from low-resolution\nones assisting the pore detection network to identify pores with a high\naccuracy. The network jointly learns a distinctive feature representation from\na real low-resolution fingerprint sample and successfully synthesizes a\nhigh-resolution sample from it. To add discriminative information and\nuniqueness for all the subjects, we have integrated features extracted from a\ndeep fingerprint verifier with the SRGAN quality discriminator. We also add\nridge reconstruction loss, utilizing ridge patterns to make the best use of\nextracted features.

We find four multiplets with varying\ndegrees of viability for this purpose: an $SU(2)_{L/R}$ bidoublet, a pair of\n$SU(4)$ decuplets and either a $SU(2)_L$ or $SU(2)_R$ triplet all of which\ncontain heavy exotic versions of the SM charged leptons.

Prior methods\nhave been focused on overcoming this problem on convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs), where the input samples like images lie in a grid domain, but have\nlargely overlooked graph neural networks (GNNs) that handle non-grid data. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel scheme dedicated to overcoming catastrophic\nforgetting problem and hence strengthen continual learning in GNNs.

Unlike the main stream of CNN-based continual learning methods that\nrely on solely slowing down the updates of parameters important to the\ndownstream task, TWP explicitly explores the local structures of the input\ngraph, and attempts to stabilize the parameters playing pivotal roles in the\ntopological aggregation.

Thus, state-of-the-art SOD networks are prone\nto be overconfident. In other words, the predicted confidence of the networks\ndoes not reflect the real probability of correctness of salient object\ndetection, which significantly hinder their real-world applicability. In this\npaper, we introduce an uncertaintyaware deep SOD network, and propose two\nstrategies from different perspectives to prevent deep SOD networks from being\noverconfident. The first strategy, namely Boundary Distribution Smoothing\n(BDS), generates continuous labels by smoothing the original binary\nground-truth with respect to pixel-wise uncertainty. The second strategy,\nnamely Uncertainty-Aware Temperature Scaling (UATS), exploits a relaxed Sigmoid\nfunction during both training and testing with spatially-variant temperature\nscaling to produce softened output. Both strategies can be incorporated into\nexisting deep SOD networks with minimal efforts. Moreover, we propose a new\nsaliency evaluation metric, namely dense calibration measure C, to measure how\nthe model is calibrated on a given dataset.

To this end, it is crucial to know the\namount of time-saving achieved by aggregating the tasks. Lack of such knowledge\ncan lead to uninformed merging and scheduling decisions that, in turn, can\ncause deadline violation of either the merged tasks or other following tasks.\nAccordingly, in this paper, we study the problem of estimating execution-time\nsaving resulted from merging tasks with the example in the context of video\nprocessing. To learn the execution-time saving in different forms of merging,\nwe first establish a set of benchmarking videos and examine a wide variety of\nvideo processing tasks -- with and without merging in place.

Coded computation utilizes concepts from\nerasure coding to mitigate the effect of stragglers by running 'coded' copies\nof tasks comprising a job; stragglers are typically treated as erasures. While\nthis is useful, there are issues with applying, e.g., MDS codes in a\nstraightforward manner. Several practical matrix computation scenarios involve\nsparse matrices. MDS codes typically require dense linear combinations of\nsubmatrices of the original matrices which destroy their inherent sparsity.\nThis is problematic as it results in significantly higher worker computation\ntimes. Moreover, treating slow nodes as erasures ignores the potentially useful\npartial computations performed by them. Furthermore, some MDS techniques also\nsuffer from significant numerical stability issues.

WST-LSPG is a generalization of the space-time least-squares\nPetrov-Galerkin method (ST-LSPG). The main drawback of ST-LSPG is that it\nrequires solving a dense space-time system with a space-time basis that is\ncalculated over the entire global time domain, which can be unfeasible for\nlarge-scale applications. Instead of using a temporally-global space-time trial\nsubspace and minimizing the discrete-in-time full-order model (FOM) residual\nover an entire time domain, the proposed WST-LSPG approach addresses this\nweakness by (1) dividing the time simulation into time windows, (2) devising a\nunique low-dimensional space-time trial subspace for each window, and (3)\nminimizing the discrete-in-time space-time residual of the dynamical system\nover each window.

Recently, machine learning with Deep Neural\nNetworks (DNNs) has emerged as a promising tool for scientific computing, with\nimpressive results achieved on problems where the dimension of the data or\nproblem domain is large. This work broadens this perspective, focusing on\napproximating functions that are Hilbert-valued, i.e. take values in a\nseparable, but typically infinite-dimensional, Hilbert space. This arises in\nscience and engineering problems, in particular those involving solution of\nparametric Partial Differential Equations (PDEs). Such problems are\nchallenging: 1) pointwise samples are expensive to acquire, 2) the function\ndomain is high dimensional, and 3) the range lies in a Hilbert space. Our\ncontributions are twofold. First, we present a novel result on DNN training for\nholomorphic functions with so-called hidden anisotropy. This result introduces\na DNN training procedure and full theoretical analysis with explicit guarantees\non error and sample complexity. The error bound is explicit in three key errors\noccurring in the approximation procedure: the best approximation, measurement,\nand physical discretization errors. Our result shows that there exists a\nprocedure (albeit non-standard) for learning Hilbert-valued functions via DNNs\nthat performs as well as, but no better than current best-in-class schemes. It\ngives a benchmark lower bound for how well DNNs can perform on such problems.\nSecond, we examine whether better performance can be achieved in practice\nthrough different types of architectures and training. We provide preliminary\nnumerical results illustrating practical performance of DNNs on parametric\nPDEs. We consider different parameters, modifying the DNN architecture to\nachieve better and competitive results, comparing these to current\nbest-in-class schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Dec 2020 02:02:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Mar 2021 00:48:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-08"}

Decoherence of the system accumulated over time can be\neffectively reduced by such a fast evolution. Noise induced by control\nimperfections can be suppressed by a systematic-error-sensitivity nullification\nmethod, thus the protocol is mostly insensitive to such noises. As a result,\nthis protocol can rapidly ($\\sim 35$ ns) generate fault-tolerant and\nhigh-fidelity ($\\gtrsim 98\\%$ with experimentally realistic parameters) quantum\ngates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Dec 2020 02:59:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Feb 2021 03:51:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 31 Aug 2021 14:14:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-29"}

This article addresses short time scale events,\nfrom minutes to days that directly cause transient disturbances in the Earth\nspace environment and generate intense adverse effects on advanced\ntechnological systems of human society. Such transient events largely fall into\nthe following four types: (1) solar flares, (2) coronal mass ejections (CMEs)\nincluding their interplanetary counterparts ICMEs, (3) solar energetic particle\n(SEP) events, and (4) stream interaction regions (SIRs) including corotating\ninteraction regions (CIRs).

Several advanced MHD models have been\ndeveloped to simulate realistic CME events from the initiation on the Sun until\ntheir arrival at 1 AU. Much progress has been made on detailed kinematic and\ndynamic behaviors of CMEs, including non-radial motion, rotation and\ndeformation of CMEs, CME-CME interaction, and stealth CMEs and problematic\nICMEs.

Since ground truth normal and reflectance maps of\nfaces are difficult to capture, we propose a novel training technique that\ncombines information from two readily available and complementary sources: a\nstereo depth signal and photometric shading cues. We evaluate our method over a\nrange of subjects and lighting conditions and describe two applications:\noptimizing stereo geometry and filling the shadows in an image.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Dec 2020 05:08:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-14"}

In this paper, a color-related local binary pattern (cLBP) which\nlearns the dominant patterns from the decoded LBP is proposed for color images\nrecognition.

In order to fully integrate domain knowledge with observations, and\nmake full use of the prior information and the strong fitting ability of neural\nnetworks, this study proposes theory-guided hard constraint projection (HCP).\nThis model converts physical constraints, such as governing equations, into a\nform that is easy to handle through discretization, and then implements hard\nconstraint optimization through projection.

The framework breakdowns\nthe relationship between a human and a machine in terms of the degree of\ncoupling and the directive authority of each party.

In order to tackle the problem, we propose a coarse-to-fine method to\nreconstruct a detailed 3D human body from multi-view images combining voxel\nsuper-resolution based on learning the implicit representation. Firstly, the\ncoarse 3D models are estimated by learning an implicit representation based on\nmulti-scale features which are extracted by multi-stage hourglass networks from\nthe multi-view images. Then, taking the low resolution voxel grids which are\ngenerated by the coarse 3D models as input, the voxel super-resolution based on\nan implicit representation is learned through a multi-stage 3D convolutional\nneural network. Finally, the refined detailed 3D human body models can be\nproduced by the voxel super-resolution which can preserve the details and\nreduce the false reconstruction of the coarse 3D models. Benefiting from the\nimplicit representation, the training process in our method is memory efficient\nand the detailed 3D human body produced by our method from multi-view images is\nthe continuous decision boundary with high-resolution geometry. In addition,\nthe coarse-to-fine method based on voxel super-resolution can remove false\nreconstructions and preserve the appearance details in the final\nreconstruction, simultaneously. In the experiments, our method quantitatively\nand qualitatively achieves the competitive 3D human body reconstructions from\nimages with various poses and shapes on both the real and synthetic datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Dec 2020 08:07:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-14"}

Here, ultra-wide binaries arise via chance\nentrapment of unrelated stars in tidal streams of disrupting clusters. It is\nshown that (i) the formation of ultra-wide binaries is not limited to the\nlifetime of a cluster, but continues after the progenitor is fully disrupted,\n(ii) the formation rate is proportional to the local phase-space density of the\ntidal tails, (iii) the semimajor axis distribution scales as $p(a)d a\\sim\na^{1/2}d a$ at $a\\ll D$, where $D$ is the mean interstellar distance, and (vi)\nthe eccentricity distribution is close to thermal, $p(e)d e= 2 e d e$. Owing to\ntheir low binding energies, ultra-wide binaries can be disrupted by both the\nsmooth tidal field and passing substructures. The time-scale on which tidal\nfluctuations dominate over the mean field is inversely proportional to the\nlocal density of clumps. Monte-Carlo experiments show that binaries subject to\ntidal evaporation follow $p(a)d a\\sim a^{-1}d a$ at $a\\gtrsim a_{\\rm peak}$,\nknown as \\\"Opik's law, with a peak semi-major axis that contracts with time as\n$a_{\\rm peak}\\sim t^{-3/4}$. In contrast, a smooth Galactic potential\nintroduces a sharp truncation at the tidal radius, $p(a)\\sim 0$ at $a\\gtrsim\nr_t$. The scaling relations of young clusters suggest that most ultra-wide\nbinaries arise from the disruption of low-mass systems. Streams of globular\nclusters may be the birthplace of hundreds of ultra-wide binaries, making them\nideal laboratories to probe clumpiness in the Galactic halo.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Dec 2020 08:12:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-20"}

The traditional\nmethods heavily depend on the feature detection and require that scene features\nbe dense and evenly distributed in the image, leading to varying ghosting\neffects and poor robustness. Learning methods usually suffer from fixed view\nand input size limitations, showing a lack of generalization ability on other\nreal datasets. In this paper, we propose an image stitching learning framework,\nwhich consists of a large-baseline deep homography module and an edge-preserved\ndeformation module. First, we propose a large-baseline deep homography module\nto estimate the accurate projective transformation between the reference image\nand the target image in different scales of features. After that, an\nedge-preserved deformation module is designed to learn the deformation rules of\nimage stitching from edge to content, eliminating the ghosting effects as much\nas possible. In particular, the proposed learning framework can stitch images\nof arbitrary views and input sizes, thus contribute to a supervised deep image\nstitching method with excellent generalization capability in other real images.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our homography module significantly\noutperforms the existing deep homography methods in the large baseline scenes.\nIn image stitching, our method is superior to the existing learning method and\nshows competitive performance with state-of-the-art traditional methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Dec 2020 08:43:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-14"}

However, each previous study on CeO2 doping has been limited to a\nsingle or a few dopants. In this paper, we systematically study the formation\nenergies, structural stability and electronic properties of CeO2 doped with the\nentire range of the ten 3d transition metals using density functional theory\n(DFT) calculations at the hybrid level. The formation energies of oxygen\nvacancies, and their effects on electronic properties, were also considered. It\nis found that most of the 3d transition metal dopants can lower the band gap of\nCeO2, with V and Co doping significantly reducing the band gap to less than 2.0\neV. Furthermore, all of the dopants can lower the formation energy of oxygen\nvacancies, and those with higher atomic numbers, particularly Cu and Zn, are\nmost effective for this purpose. The electronic structures of doped CeO2\ncompensated by oxygen vacancies show that the presence of oxygen vacancies can\nfurther lower the band gap for most of the dopants, with V-, Cr-, Fe-, Co-,\nNi-, and Cu-doped CeO2 all having band gaps of less than 2.0 eV.

Network Creation Games are a promising\napproach for this from a game-theoretic perspective. In these games, selfish\nagents corresponding to nodes in a network strategically decide which links to\nform to optimize their centrality. Many versions have been introduced and\nanalyzed, but none of them fits to modeling the evolution of social networks.\nIn real-world social networks, connections are often established by\nrecommendations from common acquaintances or by a chain of such\nrecommendations. Thus establishing and maintaining a contact with a friend of a\nfriend is easier than connecting to complete strangers. This explains the high\nclustering, i.e., the abundance of triangles, in real-world social networks.\n  We propose and analyze a network creation model inspired by real-world social\nnetworks. Edges are formed in our model via bilateral consent of both endpoints\nand the cost for establishing and maintaining an edge is proportional to the\ndistance of the endpoints before establishing the connection. We provide\nresults for generic cost functions, which essentially only must be convex\nfunctions in the distance of the endpoints without the respective edge. For\nthis broad class of cost functions, we provide many structural properties of\nequilibrium networks and prove (almost) tight bounds on the diameter, the Price\nof Anarchy and the Price of Stability. Moreover, as a proof-of-concept we show\nvia experiments that the created equilibrium networks of our model indeed\nclosely mimics real-world social networks. We observe degree distributions that\nseem to follow a power-law, high clustering, and low diameters.

We used Arabidopsis thaliana to test the\ntoxicity of the lead-based perovskite MAPbI3 (MA = CH3NH3) and several of its\nprecursors in plants.

Accumulating data suggest that this\npoorly understood control depends, at least in part, on Central Carbon\nMetabolism (CCM). In Bacillus subtilis , the glycolytic pyruvate kinase (PykA)\nis intricately linked to replication. This 585 amino-acid-long enzyme comprises\na catalytic (Cat) domain that binds to phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and ADP to\nproduce pyruvate and ATP, and a C-terminal domain of unknown function.\nInterestingly, the C-terminal domain termed PEPut interacts with Cat and is\nhomologous a domain that, in other metabolic enzymes, are phosphorylated at a\nconserved TSH motif at the expense of PEP and ATP to drive sugar import and\ncatalytic or regulatory activities. To gain insights into the role of PykA in\nreplication, DNA synthesis was analyzed in various Cat and PEPut mutants grown\nin a medium where the metabolic activity of PykA is dispensable for growth.\nMeasurements of replication parameters ( ori/ter ratio, C period and fork\nspeed) and of the pyruvate kinase activity showed that PykA mutants exhibit\nreplication defects resulting from side chain modifications in the PykA protein\nrather than from a reduction of its metabolic activity. Interestingly, Cat and\nPEPut have distinct commitments in replication: while Cat impacts positively\nand negatively replication fork speed, PEPut stimulates initiation through a\nprocess depending on Cat-PEPut interaction and growth conditions. Residues\nbinding to PEP and ADP in Cat, stabilizing the Cat-PEPut interaction and\nbelonging to the TSH motif of PEPut were found important for the commitment of\nPykA in replication. In vitro , PykA affects the activities of replication\nenzymes (the polymerase DnaE, helicase DnaC and primase DnaG) essential for\ninitiation and elongation and genetically linked to pykA . Our results thus\nconnect replication initiation and elongation to CCM metabolites (PEP, ATP and\nADP), critical Cat and PEPut residues and to multiple links between PykA and\nthe replication enzymes DnaE, DnaC and DnaG. We propose that PykA is endowed\nwith a moonlighting activity that senses the concentration of signaling\nmetabolites and interacts with replication enzymes to convey information on the\ncellular metabolic state to the replication machinery and adjust replication\ninitiation and elongation to metabolism.

Chaos and hyperchaos can\noccur in an ensemble by adding or excluding one or more elements. Moreover,\nchaos arises hard, since in this case the control parameter is discrete. The\ninfluence of the coupling strength on the occurrence of chaos is specific.

The model atmosphere\nshows the emergence of magnetic loops with a size of several arcsecs into a\npre-existing predominantly unipolar field.

We have\nconstructed an apparatus for PNS threshold determination on a subject's limb,\ncapable of narrow and broad-band magnetic excitation with pulse characteristic\ntimes down to 40 us. From a first set of measurements on 51 volunteers, we\nobserve that PNS limits coincide for sinusoidal (biphasic narrow-band) and\ntriangular (biphasic broad-band) excitations, and are slightly lower for\ntrapezoidal (monophasic broad-band) pulses. We have also measured statistically\nsignificant correlations of PNS sensitivity with arm size and body weight, and\nno correlation with height or gender. As opposed to resonant systems, our setup\nallows the execution of arbitrarily short pulse trains.

The goal of\nthis paper is to describe the validation results in terms of completeness,\naccuracy, and precision for the Gaia EDR3 data and to provide recommendations\nfor the use of the catalogue data. The validation processes include a\nsystematic analysis of the catalogue contents to detect anomalies, either\nindividual errors or statistical properties, using statistical analysis and\ncomparisons to the previous release as well as to external data and to models.\nGaia EDR3 represents a major step forward, compared to Gaia DR2, in terms of\nprecision, accuracy, and completeness for both astrometry and photometry. We\nprovide recommendations for dealing with issues related to the parallax zero\npoint, negative parallaxes, photometry for faint sources, and the quality\nindicators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Dec 2020 11:05:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-28"}

In order to compensate\nfor the path loss of high frequency, massive multiple-input multiple-output\n(MIMO) can be utilized for high array gains by beamforming. However, since a\nlarge number of analog phase shifters should be used to realize the analog\nbeamforming, the existing THz communication with massive MIMO has very high\nenergy consumption. To solve this problem, a reconfigurable intelligent surface\n(RIS)-based hybrid precoding architecture for THz communication is developed in\nthis paper, where the energy-hungry phased array is replaced by the\nenergy-efficient RIS to realize the analog beamforming of the hybrid precoding.\nThen, based on the proposed RIS-based architecture, a sum-rate maximization\nproblem for hybrid precoding is investigated. Since the phase shifts\nimplemented by RIS in practice are often discrete, this sum-rate maximization\nproblem with a non-convex constraint is challenging.

Source localisation is to find sources of\natmospheric hazardous material release in a partially unknown environment. This\npaper proposes a control theoretic approach to this autonomous search problem.\nTo cope with an unknown target location, at each step, the target location is\nestimated by Bayesian inference. Then a control action is taken to minimise the\nerror between future robot position and the hypothesised future estimation of\nthe target location. The latter is generated by hypothesised measurements at\nthe corresponding future robot positions (due to the control action) with the\ncurrent estimation of the target location as a prior. It shows that this\napproach can take into account both the error between the next robot position\nand the estimate of the target location, and the uncertainty of the estimate.\nThis approach is further extended to the case with not only an unknown source\nlocation, but also an unknown local environment (e.g. wind speed and\ndirection). Different from current information theoretic approaches, this new\ncontrol theoretic approach achieves the optimal trade-off between exploitation\nand exploration in a unknown environment with an unknown target by driving the\nrobot moving towards estimated target location while reducing its estimation\nuncertainty. This scheme is implemented using particle filtering on a mobile\nrobot. Simulation and experimental studies demonstrate promising performance of\nthe proposed approach. The relationships between the proposed approach,\ninformative path planning, dual control, and classic model predictive control\nare discussed and compared.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Dec 2020 12:14:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Jun 2021 12:26:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-18"}

Preventing\ndata exposures is challenging, because the causes for such events are various,\nranging from hacking to misconfigured databases.

This paper aims to characterise the spatial variability in R0\nacross the first six months of the global COVID-19 outbreak, and to explore\nsocial factors that impact R0 estimates at national and regional level.\n  METHODS: We searched PubMed, LitCOVID and the WHO COVID-19 database from\nJanuary to June 2020. Peer-reviewed English-language papers were included that\nprovided R0 estimates. For each study, the value of the estimate, country under\nstudy and publication month were extracted. The median R0 value was calculated\nper country, and the median and variance were calculated per region. For each\ncountry with an R0 estimate, the Human Development Index (HDI), Sustainable\nMobility Index (SMI), median age, population density and development status\nwere obtained from external sources.\n  RESULTS: A total of 81 studies were included in the analysis. These studies\nprovided at least one estimate of R0, along with sufficient methodology to\nexplain how the value was calculated. Values of R0 ranged between 0.48 and\n14.8, and between 0.48 and 6.7 when excluding outliers.\n  CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review provides a comprehensive overview of the\nestimates of the basic reproduction number of COVID-19 globally and highlights\nthe spatial heterogeneity in R0.

Biologically, the goal of\nthese models is to understand what governs the severity of infections, the\npatterns of infectiousness, and the variation thereof across individual hosts.\nMathematically, these models are based on dynamical systems, with standard\napproaches ranging from K-compartments ordinary differential equations (ODEs)\nto delay differential equations (DDEs), to capture the relatively constant\nduration of replication and bursting once a parasite infects a host red blood\ncell. Using malariatherapy data, which offers fine-scale resolution on the\ndynamics of infection across a number of individual hosts, we compare the fit\nand robustness of one of these standard approaches (K-compartments ODE) with a\npartial differential equations (PDEs) model, which explicitly tracks the \"age\"\nof an infected cell.

Finally, the\nK-compartments ODE model (for suitably chosen K) and the PDE model highlight a\nstrong qualitative connection between the density of transmissible parasite\nstages (i.e., gametocytes) and the density of host-damaging (and\nasexually-replicating) parasite stages.

An appropriate oculomotor\nparameterization is defined, and is shown to complement the classical version\nand vergence angles. The midline horopter is identified, and subsequently used\nto construct the epipolar geometry of the system. It is shown that the\nEssential matrix can be obtained by combining the epipoles with the projection\nof the midline horopter. A local model of the scene is adopted, in which depth\nis measured relative to a plane containing the fixation point. The binocular\ndisparity field is given a symmetric parameterization, in which the unknown\nscene-depths determine the location of corresponding image-features. The\nresulting Cyclopean depth-map can be combined with the estimated oculomotor\nparameters, to produce a local representation of the scene. The recovery of\nvisual direction and depth from retinal images is discussed, with reference to\nthe relevant psychophysical and neurophysiological literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Dec 2020 14:05:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-14"}

The results show our approach to be significantly better\ncompared to other fuzzing approaches at generating semantically valid Kotlin\nprograms, while creating more interesting crash-inducing inputs at the same\ntime. We managed to find more than 50 previously unknown compiler crashes, of\nwhich 18 were considered important after their triage by the compiler team.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Dec 2020 14:32:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-14"}

First, while\nthreat models can be well-defined, attacker strategies may still vary widely\nwithin those constraints. Therefore, detection should be considered as an\nopen-set problem, standing in contrast to most current detection approaches.\nThese methods take a closed-set view and train binary detectors, thus biasing\ndetection toward attacks seen during detector training. Second, limited\ninformation is available at test time and typically confounded by nuisance\nfactors including the label and underlying content of the image. We address\nthese challenges via a novel strategy based on random subspace analysis. We\npresent a technique that utilizes properties of random projections to\ncharacterize the behavior of clean and adversarial examples across a diverse\nset of subspaces.

This stage represents one of the\nmost challenging steps in image processing, as it is difficult to separate\nuniform and homogeneous objects from the background. In this paper, we present\na new, open source plugin for the automatic segmentation of an image of a seed\nsample. This plugin was written in Java to allow it to work with ImageJ open\nsource software. The new plugin was tested on a total of 3,386 seed samples\nfrom 120 species belonging to the Fabaceae family. Digital images were acquired\nusing a flatbed scanner. In order to test the efficacy of this approach in\nterms of identifying the edges of objects and separating them from the\nbackground, each sample was scanned using four different hues of blue for the\nbackground, and a total of 480 digital images were elaborated.

High quality\nepitaxial Gr/Co\\n/HM(111) (HM=Pt,Ir) heterostructures are grown by\nintercalation below graphene, which acts as a surfactant that kinetically\nstabilizes the pseudomorphic growth of highly perfect Co face-centered\ntetragonal ($fct$) films, with a reduced number of stacking faults as the only\nstructural defect observable by high resolution scanning transmission electron\nmicroscopy (HR-STEM). Magneto-optic Kerr effect (MOKE) measurements show that\nsuch heterostructures present PMA up to large Co critical thicknesses of about\n4~nm (20~ML) and 2~nm (10~ML) for Pt and Ir substrates, respectively, while\nX-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) measurements show an inverse power law\nof the anistropy of the orbital moment with Co thickness, reflecting its\ninterfacial nature, that changes sign at about the same critical values. First\nprinciples calculations show that, regardless of the presence of graphene,\nideal Co $fct$ films on HM buffers do not sustain PMAs beyond around 6~MLs due\nto the in-plane contribution of the inner bulk-like Co layers. The large\nexperimental critical thicknesses sustaining PMA can only be retrieved by the\ninclusion of structural defects that promote a local $hcp$ stacking such as\ntwin boundaries or stacking faults. Remarkably, a layer resolved analysis of\nthe orbital momentum anisotropy reproduces its interfacial nature, and reveals\nthat the Gr/Co interface contribution is comparable to that of the Co/Pt(Ir).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Dec 2020 15:21:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-14"}

Design: Retrospective cohort study.\nSetting: Large academic hospital network of 10 hospitals accounting for a total\nof 2,384 beds and 136,000 discharges in New England. Participants: 6,841\nemployees working on-site of Hospital 1 from April 2, 2020 to November 4, 2020,\nwho live in the 10 hospitals' service areas. Interventions: Mandatory, daily\nemployee self-reported symptoms were collected using an automated text\nmessaging system. Main Outcomes: Mean absolute error (MAE) and weighted mean\nabsolute percentage error (WMAPE) of 7 day forecasts of daily COVID-19 hospital\ncensus at each hospital. Results: 6,841 employees, with a mean age of 40.8 (SD\n= 13.6), 8.8 years of service (SD = 10.4), and 74.8% were female (n = 5,120),\nliving in the 10 hospitals' service areas. Our model has an MAE of 6.9 COVID-19\npatients and a WMAPE of 1.5% for hospitalizations for the entire hospital\nnetwork. The individual hospitals had an MAE that ranged from 0.9 to 4.5\npatients (WMAPE ranged from 2.1% to 16.1%). At Hospital 1, a doubling of the\nnumber of employees reporting symptoms (which corresponds to 4 additional\nemployees reporting symptoms at the mean for Hospital 1) is associated with a\n5% increase in COVID-19 hospitalizations at Hospital 1 in 7 days (95% CI:\n(0.02, 0.07)).

In order to\nlower the number of allowed reconstructions, one tries to incorporate possible\nextra geometric constraints in the tomographic problem.

One of the key points in the development of the\nconstitutive laws of these materials, either at the local or at the global\nscale, is to formulate a free energy density (or enthalpy) from vectors,\ntensors, at a given order and for a class of given symmetry, depending on the\nsymmetry classes of the crystal constituting the material or the symmetry of\nthe representative volume element. This article takes as a support of study the\nstress and magnetization couple ($\\sigma$, m) involved in the phenomena of\nmagnetoelastic coupling in a cubic symmetry medium. Several studies indeed show\na non-monotonic sensitivity of the magnetic susceptibility and magnetostriction\nof certain soft magnetic materials under stress. Modeling such a phenomenon\nrequires the introduction of a second order stress term in the Gibbs free\nenergy density. A polynomial formulation in the two variables stress and\nmagnetization is preferred over a tensorial formulation. For a given material\nsymmetry class, this allows to express more easily the free energy density at\nany bi-degree in $\\sigma$ and m (i.e. at any constitutive tensors order for the\nso-called tensorial formulation). A rigorous and systematic method is essential\nto obtain the high-degree magneto-mechanical coupling terms and to build a free\nenergy density function at any order which is invariant by the action of the\ncubic (octahedral) group. For that aim, theoretical and computer tools in\nInvariant Theory, that allow for the mathematical description of cubic\nnonlinear magneto-elasticity, are introduced. Minimal integrity bases of the\ninvariant algebra for the pair (m, $\\sigma$), under the proper\n(orientation-preserving) and the full cubic groups, are then proposed. The\nminimal integrity basis for the proper cubic group is constituted of 60\ninvariants, while the minimal integrity basis for the full cubic group (the one\nof interest for magneto-elasticity) is made up of 30 invariants. These\ninvariants are formulated in a (coordinate free) intrinsic manner, using a\ngeneralized cross product to write some of them. The counting of independent\ninvariants of a given multi-degree in (m, $\\sigma$) is performed. It is shown\naccordingly that it is possible to list without error all the material\nparameters useful for the description of the coupled magnetoelastic behavior\nfrom the integrity basis. The technique is applied to derive general\nexpressions $\\Psi$ $\\star$ ($\\sigma$, m) of the free energy density at the\nmagnetic domains scale exhibiting cubic symmetry. The classic results for an\nisotropic medium are recovered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 11 Dec 2020 10:08:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-24"}
