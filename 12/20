Despite its crucial\nimportance, the droplet growth resulting from the oversaturation pulse in this\nternary system is still poorly understood. We experimentally and theoretically\nstudy this growth in Hele-Shaw like channels by measuring the total volume of\nthe oil droplets that nucleates out of it. In order to prevent the\noversaturated oil from exiting the channel, we decorated some of the channels\nwith a porous region in the middle.

Existing 3D reconstruction systems inevitably make trade-offs\nbetween three conflicting goals: the efficiency of reconstruction (e.g., time\nand memory requirements), the visual quality of the constructed scene, and the\nrendering speed on the VR device. This paper proposes a reconstruction system\nthat simultaneously meets all three goals. The key idea is to avoid the\nresource-demanding process of reconstructing a high-polygon mesh altogether.\nInstead, we propose to directly transfer details from the original point cloud\nto a low polygon mesh, which significantly reduces the reconstruction time and\ncost, preserves the scene details, and enables real-time rendering on mobile VR\ndevices.\n  While our technique is general, we demonstrate it in reconstructing cultural\nheritage sites. We for the first time digitally reconstruct the Elmina Castle,\na UNESCO world heritage site at Ghana, from billions of laser-scanned points.\nThe reconstruction process executes on low-end desktop systems without\nrequiring high processing power, making it accessible to the broad community.\nThe reconstructed scenes render on Oculus Go in 60 FPS, providing a real-time\nVR experience with high visual quality.

However, the influences of these factors usually vary\nover the course of a day, and if there is good temporal resolution, there could\nalso be significant effects only for some hours/minutes (rush hours, the hours\nwhen shops are open, and so forth). Thus, in this paper, an analysis of\nHelsinki's bike-sharing data from 2017 is conducted that considers full\ntemporal and spatial resolutions. Moreover, the data are available at a very\nhigh frequency. Hence, the station hire data is analysed in a spatiotemporal\nfunctional setting, where the number of bikes at a station is defined as a\ncontinuous function of the time of day.

Compositionality and the generalisation abilities of the\nemergent languages are assessed using topographic similarity and zero-shot\ncompositional tests. Firstly, we provide evidence that the test-train split\nstrategy significantly impacts the zero-shot compositional tests when dealing\nwith visual stimuli, whilst it does not when dealing with symbolic ones.\nSecondly, empirical evidence shows that using the ST-GS approach with small\nbatch sizes and an overcomplete communication channel improves compositionality\nin the emerging languages. Nevertheless, while shown robust with symbolic\nstimuli, the effect of the batch size is not so clear-cut when dealing with\nvisual stimuli. Our results also show that not all overcomplete communication\nchannels are created equal. Indeed, while increasing the maximum sentence\nlength is found to be beneficial to further both compositionality and\ngeneralisation abilities, increasing the vocabulary size is found detrimental.\nFinally, a lack of correlation between the language compositionality at\ntraining-time and the agents' generalisation abilities is observed in the\ncontext of discriminative referential games with visual stimuli.

Using the\ntheory of sketches, one may define syntactic categories for type theories in a\nstyle that resembles the use of Martin-L\\\"of's Logical Framework, following the\n\"judgments as types\" principle. The concentration of type theories into their\nlocally Cartesian closed categories of judgments is particularly convenient for\nproving syntactic metatheorems by semantic means (canonicity, normalization,\netc.). Perhaps surprisingly, the notion of a context plays no role in the\ndefinitions of type theories in this sense, but the structure of a class of\ndisplay maps can be imposed on a theory post facto wherever needed, as\nadvocated by the Edinburgh school and realized by the %worlds declarations of\nthe Twelf proof assistant.\n  Uemura has proposed representable map categories together with a stratified\nlogical framework for similar purposes.

The random forest algorithm\nperforms best when comprised of a set of trees that are individually accurate\nin their predictions, yet which also make 'different' mistakes, i.e., have\nweakly correlated prediction errors. A key observation is that these properties\nare closely related to the relevance and exclusion requirements of valid\ninstrumental variables. We design a data-driven procedure to select tuples of\nindividual trees from a random forest, in which one tree serves as the\nendogenous covariate and the other trees serve as its instruments. Simulation\nexperiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in mitigating\nestimation biases and its superior performance over three alternative methods\nfor bias correction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Dec 2020 21:48:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-22"}

The DDD simulations include uniaxial compression of\nmicro-pillars with different sizes and over a wide range of initial dislocation\ndensities and spatial distributions of dislocations. An SGP model is employed\nat the continuum level that accounts for the size-dependency of flow stress and\nhardening rate.

The variance-based global\nsensitivity analysis determines the effect of parameter uncertainty on the SGP\nmodel prediction.

NER provides support for text\nmining in biochemical reactions, including entity relation extraction,\nattribute extraction, and metabolic response relationship extraction. However,\nthe existence of complex naming characteristics in the biomedical field, such\nas polysemy and special characters, make the NER task very challenging. Here,\nwe propose a hybrid deep learning approach to improve the recognition accuracy\nof NER. Specifically, our approach applies the Bidirectional Encoder\nRepresentations from Transformers (BERT) model to extract the underlying\nfeatures of the text, learns a representation of the context of the text\nthrough Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (BILSTM), and incorporates the\nmulti-head attention (MHATT) mechanism to extract chapter-level features. In\nthis approach, the MHATT mechanism aims to improve the recognition accuracy of\nabbreviations to efficiently deal with the problem of inconsistency in\nfull-text labels. Moreover, conditional random field (CRF) is used to label\nsequence tags because this probabilistic method does not need strict\nindependence assumptions and can accommodate arbitrary context information. The\nexperimental evaluation on a publicly-available dataset shows that the proposed\nhybrid approach achieves the best recognition performance; in particular, it\nsubstantially improves performance in recognizing abbreviations, polysemes, and\nlow-frequency entities, compared with the state-of-the-art approaches. For\ninstance, compared with the recognition accuracies for low-frequency entities\nproduced by the BILSTM-CRF algorithm, those produced by the hybrid approach on\ntwo entity datasets (MULTIPLE and IDENTIFIER) have been increased by 80% and\n21.69%, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Dec 2020 01:30:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-22"}

The website fingerprinting attack enables a local passive\neavesdropper to predict the target user's browsing activities even she uses\nanonymous technologies, such as VPNs, IPsec, and Tor. Recently, the growth of\ndeep learning empowers adversaries to conduct the website fingerprinting attack\nwith higher accuracy. In this paper, we propose a new defense against website\nfingerprinting attack using adversarial deep learning approaches called\nAdversarial Website Adaptation (AWA). AWA creates a transformer set in each run\nso that each website has a unique transformer. Each transformer generates\nadversarial traces to evade the adversary's classifier. AWA has two versions,\nincluding Universal AWA (UAWA) and Non-Universal AWA (NUAWA). Unlike NUAWA,\nthere is no need to access the entire trace of a website in order to generate\nan adversarial trace in UAWA. We accommodate secret random elements in the\ntraining phase of transformers in order for AWA to generate various sets of\ntransformers in each run. We run AWA several times and create multiple sets of\ntransformers. If an adversary and a target user select different sets of\ntransformers, the accuracy of adversary's classifier is almost 19.52% and\n31.94% with almost 22.28% and 26.28% bandwidth overhead in UAWA and NUAWA,\nrespectively.

Imposing regularity conditions on these\nperturbations on the future (past) horizon corresponds to imposing an in-going\n(out-going) wave boundary condition. For exotic compact objects (ECOs) with\nexternal Kerr spacetime, however, it is not yet clear how to physically impose\nboundary conditions for curvature perturbations on their boundaries. We address\nthis problem using the Membrane Paradigm, by considering a family of fiducial\nobservers (FIDOs) that float right above the horizon of a linearly perturbed\nKerr black hole. From the reference frame of these observers, the ECO will\nexperience tidal perturbations due to in-going gravitational waves, respond to\nthese waves, and generate out-going waves. As it also turns out, if both\nin-going and out-going waves exist near the horizon, the Newman Penrose (NP)\nquantity $\\psi_0$ will be numerically dominated by the in-going wave, while the\nNP quantity $\\psi_4$ will be dominated by the out-going wave. In this way, we\nobtain the ECO boundary condition in the form of a relation between $\\psi_0$\nand the complex conjugate of $\\psi_4$, in a way that is determined by the ECO's\ntidal response in the FIDO frame. We explore several ways to modify\ngravitational-wave dispersion in the FIDO frame, and deduce the corresponding\nECO boundary condition for Teukolsky functions. We subsequently obtain the\nboundary condition for $\\psi_4$ alone, as well as for the Sasaki-Nakamura and\nDetweiler's functions. As it also turns out, reflection of spinning ECOs will\ngenerically mix between different $\\ell$ components of the perturbations\nfields, and be different for perturbations with different parities. We also\napply our boundary condition to computing gravitational-wave echoes from\nspinning ECOs, and solve for the spinning ECOs' quasi-normal modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Dec 2020 04:26:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-02"}

To solve this issue, orthogonal/vector AMP (OAMP/VAMP)\nwas proposed for general right-unitarily-invariant matrices.

In this paper, a\nhierarchical structure of grid energy router is proposed to greatly facilitate\npeer-to-peer energy sharing among energy routers. It can be placed at critical\nbuses to make active distribution networks develop into multiple interconnected\nprosumer-based autonomous systems. To alleviate the mismatch between the\nmedium-time dispatch and device-level control caused by the forecast error of\ndistributed generation, a bi-level primary energy dispatching strategy is\nproposed to fully utilize the energy buffer of multiple grid energy routers.\nThe power variation in short-time scale is well suppressed by sharing energy\nbuffer in the upper-level control, and the energy buffer is further optimized\nto better absorb the variation. Combining measured information, the lower-level\ncontrol is designed to track the optimized instruction of energy buffer in\nreal-time scale, which is a distributed process. The power flow constraint is\nassumed to be handled by medium-time dispatch, and the current constraint of\nthe device is only taken into consideration. Finally, simulation results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of proposed hierarchical structure and primary\nenergy dispatching strategy of the grid energy router.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Dec 2020 09:18:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-22"}

Therefore, thin cloud removal is an\nindispensable procedure to enhance the utilization of remote sensing images.\nGenerally, even though contaminated by thin clouds, the pixels still retain\nmore or less surface information. Hence, different from thick cloud removal,\nthin cloud removal algorithms normally concentrate on inhibiting the cloud\ninfluence rather than substituting the cloud-contaminated pixels. Meanwhile,\nconsidering the surface features obscured by the cloud are usually similar to\nadjacent areas, the dependency between each pixel of the input is useful to\nreconstruct contaminated areas. In this paper, to make full use of the\ndependencies between pixels of the image, we propose a Multi-Head Linear\nAttention Generative Adversarial Network (MLAGAN) for Thin Cloud Removal. The\nMLA-GAN is based on the encoding-decoding framework consisting of multiple\nattention-based layers and deconvolutional layers.

One important challenge is about suppressing the shear\nbias on source images of low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR$\\lesssim10$).\nPreviously, it has been demonstrated that the shear estimators defined in the\nFourier_Quad (FQ) method can achieve sub-percent accuracy at the very faint end\n(SNR$\\lesssim5$) through ensemble averaging. Later, it is found that we can\napproach the minimum statistical error (the Cramer-Rao Bound) by symmetrizing\nthe full PDF of the FQ shear estimators (the PDF_SYM approach), instead of\ntaking ensemble averages. Recently, with a large amount of mock galaxy images,\nwe are able to identify some small amount of shear biases in the PDF_SYM\napproach at the faint end. The multiplicative bias goes up to\n$1-2\\times10^{-2}$ at SNR $\\lesssim 10$, and the anisotropy of the point spread\nfunction (PSF) causes an additive bias that can reach a few times $10^{-4}$. We\nfind that these biases originate from the noise-source coupling in the galaxy\npower spectrum. It turns out that this problem can be largely fixed by adding\nadditional terms to the FQ shear estimators. The resulting multiplicative and\nadditive biases can be significantly suppressed to the level of $10^{-3}$ and\n$10^{-5}$ respectively. These corrections substantially extend the available\nSNR range for accurate shear measurement with the PDF_SYM approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Dec 2020 11:55:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-05"}

The mechanisms and success of behavior\nchange techniques and interventions are broadly investigated in the field of\npsychology. However, it is not always easy to adapt these psychological\nfindings to the context of immersive technologies. The lack of theoretical\nfoundation also leads to a lack of explanation as to why and how immersive\ninterventions support behavior change processes. The Behavioral Framework for\nimmersive Technologies (BehaveFIT) addresses this lack by (1) presenting an\nintelligible categorization and condensation of psychological barriers and\nimmersive features, by (2) suggesting a mapping that shows why and how\nimmersive technologies can help to overcome barriers, and finally by (3)\nproposing a generic prediction path that enables a structured, theory-based\napproach to the development and evaluation of immersive interventions. These\nthree steps explain how BehaveFIT can be used, and include guiding questions\nand one example for each step. Thus, the present paper contributes to guidance\nfor immersive intervention design and evaluation, showing that immersive\ninterventions support behavior change processes and explain and predict 'why'\nand 'how' immersive interventions can bridge the intention-behavior-gap.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Dec 2020 12:48:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-22"}

BioCIE improved the fidelity of instance-wise and class-wise\nexplanations by 11.6% and 7.5%, respectively. It also improved the\ninterpretability of explanations by 8%. BioCIE can be effectively used to\nexplain how a black-box biomedical text classification model semantically\nrelates input texts to class labels.

Recently a handful of HIC methods are developed based on the graph\nconvolution networks (GCNs), which effectively relieves the scarcity of labeled\ndata for deep learning based HIC methods. To further lift the classification\nperformance, in this work we propose a graph convolution network (GCN) based\nframework for HSI classification that uses two clustering operations to better\nexploit multi-hop node correlations and also effectively reduce graph size. In\nparticular, we first cluster the pixels with similar spectral features into a\nsuperpixel and build the graph based on the superpixels of the input HSI. Then\ninstead of performing convolution over this superpixel graph, we further\npartition it into several sub-graphs by pruning the edges with weak weights, so\nas to strengthen the correlations of nodes with high similarity. This second\nround of clustering also further reduces the graph size, thus reducing the\ncomputation burden of graph convolution. Experimental results on three widely\nused benchmark datasets well prove the effectiveness of our proposed framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Dec 2020 14:16:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-22"}

However, in contrast with\nthe radiative heating of natural flows, laboratory experiments have focused on\nconvection driven by heating and cooling plates: the heat transport is then\nseverely restricted by boundary layers near the plates, which prevents the\nrealization of the mixing-length scaling-law used in evolution models of\ngeophysical and astrophysical flows. There is therefore an important\ndiscrepancy between the scaling-laws measured in laboratory experiments and\nthose used eg. in stellar evolution models. Here we provide experimental and\nnumerical evidence that radiatively driven convection spontaneously achieves\nthe mixing-length scaling regime, also known as the `ultimate' regime of\nthermal convection.

The\nsub-nanosecond time resolution and single particle detection capability of the\nsensors allow bunch-by-bunch measurements, enable CLAWS to perform a novel time\nresolved analysis of beam backgrounds, and make the system uniquely suited for\nthe study of injection backgrounds. We present measurements of various aspects\nof regular beam background and injection backgrounds which include time\nstructure and decay behavior of injection backgrounds, hit-energy spectra and\noverall background rates. These measurements show that the elevated background\nrates following an injection generally last for several milliseconds, with the\nmajority of the background particles typically observed within the first 500\nus. The injection backgrounds exhibit pronounced patterns in time, connected to\nbetatron and synchrotron oscillations in the accelerator rings. The frequencies\nof these patterns are determined from detector data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 20 Dec 2020 15:06:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 21 Nov 2021 19:39:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-23"}

Proper documentation plays an\nimportant role in successful software management and maintenance. Users exploit\nIssue Tracking Systems, a facility of software repositories, to keep track of\nissue reports, to manage the workload and processes, and finally, to document\nthe highlight of their team's effort. An issue report is a rich source of\ncollaboratively curated software knowledge, and can contain a reported problem,\na request for new features, or merely a question about the software product. As\nthe number of these issues increases, it becomes harder to manage them\nmanually. GitHub provides labels for tagging issues, as a means of issue\nmanagement. However, about half of the issues in GitHub's top 1000 repositories\ndo not have any labels. We aim at automating the process of managing issue\nreports for software teams.

On the other hand, pulsating\nhelium-rich ultra-massive white dwarfs could be even more attractive objects\nfor asteroseismology if they were found, as they should be hotter and less\ncrystallized than pulsating hydrogen-rich white dwarfs, something that would\npave the way for probing their deep interiors.

Our goal is to\nprovide a theoretical basis that could eventually help to discern the core\ncomposition of ultra-massive white dwarfs and the scenario of their formation\nthrough asteroseismology, anticipating the possible future detection of\npulsations in this type of stars. We find that, given that the white dwarf\nmodels coming from the three scenarios considered are characterized by distinct\ncore chemical profiles, their pulsation properties are also different, thus\nleading to distinctive signatures in the period-spacing and mode-trapping\nproperties. Our results indicate that, in case of an eventual detection of\npulsating ultra-massive helium-rich white dwarfs, it would be possible to\nderive valuable information encrypted in the core of these stars in connection\nwith the origin of such exotic objects.

The VGG, ResNet and DenseNet models are used to test\nthe impact of the proposed attack. It is observed that the performance of the\nCNNs degrades drastically under the proposed CCP attack. Result show the effect\nof the proposed simple CCP attack over the robustness of the CNN trained model.\nThe results are also compared with existing CNN fooling approaches to evaluate\nthe accuracy drop. We also propose a primary defense mechanism to this problem\nby augmenting the training dataset with the proposed CCP attack. The\nstate-of-the-art performance using the proposed solution in terms of the CNN\nrobustness under CCP attack is observed in the experiments.

However, each of these methods has some\ndrawbacks limiting the applicability of the designed devices for real-life\nscenarios. For instance, TO studies lead to bulky coating layer with the\nthickness that is comparable to, or even larger than the dimension of the\nconcealed object. In this paper, based on the coordinate transformation, an\nultrathin carpet cloak is proposed to hide objects with arbitrary shape and\nsize using a thin anisotropic material, called as infinitely anisotropic medium\n(IAM). It is shown that unlike the previous metasurface-based carpet cloaks,\nthe proposed IAM hides objects from all viewing incident angles while it is\nextremely thin compared with the object dimensions. This material also\ncircumvents the conventional transformation optics complexities and could be\neasily implemented in practical scenarios. To demonstrate the capability of the\nproposed carpet cloak, several full-wave simulations are carried out. Finally,\nas a proof of concept, the IAM is implemented based on the effective medium\ntheory which exhibits good agreement with the results obtained from the\ntheoretical investigations. The introduced material not only constitutes a\nsignificant step towards the invisibility cloak but also can greatly promote\nthe practical application of the other TO-based devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Dec 2020 16:51:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-01"}

While the compact layers\nare entirely polymethacrylate without any intentional internal structures, the\nlow-density layers contain sub-wavelength sized slanted columnar inclusions to\nallow the mechanical compression in a direction normal to the layer interfaces\nof the photonic crystal. Terahertz transmission spectroscopy of the photonic\ncrystal was performed in a spectral range from 83 to 124 GHz as a function of\nthe compressive strain. The as-fabricated photonic crystal showed a distinct\nphotonic bandgap centered at 109 GHz, which blue shifted under compressive\nstress. A maximum shift of 12 GHz in the bandgap center frequency was\nexperimentally demonstrated.
