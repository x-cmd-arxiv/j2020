The\narchitecture enables real-time monitoring and control and supports electric\nvehicle (EV) charging at scale. The ACN adopts a flexible Adaptive Scheduling\nAlgorithm based on convex optimization and model predictive control and allows\nfor significant over-subscription of electrical infrastructure. We describe\nsome of the practical challenges in real-world charging systems, including\nunbalanced three-phase infrastructure, non-ideal battery charging behavior, and\nquantized control signals. We demonstrate how the Adaptive Scheduling Algorithm\nhandles these challenges, and compare its performance against baseline\nalgorithms from the deadline scheduling literature using real workloads\nrecorded from the Caltech ACN and accurate system models. We find that in these\nrealistic settings, our scheduling algorithm can improve operator profit by 3.4\ntimes over uncontrolled charging and consistently outperforms baseline\nalgorithms when delivering energy in highly congested systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 2020 18:28:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-07"}

The charging process induces spurious forces on\nthe test masses that affect the sensitivity of these instruments mainly below\n$10^{-3}$ Hz. Geant4 and FLUKA Monte Carlo simulations were carried out to\nstudy the TM charging process on board the LISA Pathfinder mission that\nremained into orbit around the Sun-Earth Lagrange point L1 between 2016 and\n2017. While a good agreement was observed between simulations and measurements\nof the TMs net charging, the shot noise associated with charging fluctuations\nof both positive and negative particles resulted 3-4 times higher that\npredicted. The origin of this mismatch was attributed to the propagation of\nelectrons and photons only above 100 eV in the simulations. In this paper,\nlow-energy electromagnetic processes to be included in the future Monte Carlo\nsimulations for LISA and LISA-like space interferometers TM charging are\nconsidered. {It is found that electrons and photons below 100 eV give a\ncontribution to the effective charging comparable to that of the whole sample\nof particles above this energy. In particular, for incident protons ionization\ncontributes twice with respect to low energy kinetic emission and electron\nbackscattering. The other processes are found to play a negligible role. For\nheavy nuclei only sputtering must be considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 2020 16:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}

In this article, we present a\nphysical picture for a better understanding of the hysteresis-free charge boost\neffect observed experimentally in metal-ferroelectric-insulator-metal (MFIM)\ncapacitors. By introducing the dielectric (DE) leakage and interfacial trapped\ncharges, our simulations of the hysteresis loops are in a strong agreement with\nthe experimental measurements, suggesting the existence of an interfacial oxide\nlayer at the FE-metal interface in metal-ferroelectric-metal (MFM) capacitors.\nBased on the pulse switching measurements, we find that the charge enhancement\nand hysteresis are dominated by the FE domain viscosity and DE leakage,\nrespectively. Our simulation results show that the underlying mechanisms for\nthe observed hysteresis-free charge enhancement in MFIM may be physically\ndifferent from the alleged NC stabilization and capacitance matching. Moreover,\nthe link between Merz's law and the phenomenological kinetic coefficient is\ndiscussed, and the possible cause of the residual charges observed after pulse\nswitching is explained by the trapped charge dynamics at the FE-DE interface.\nThe physical interpretation presented in this work can provide important\ninsights into the NC effect in MFIM capacitors and future studies of low-power\nlogic devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 2020 16:01:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-24"}

The MSAc\ninvokes only the MSA bulk direct correlation function whereas the MSAu also\nincorporates the MSA bulk internal energy. Although MSAu yields profiles that\nagree best with MD simulations in the near field, in the far field we observe\nthat the decay lengths are consistent between IET, MSAc, and MD simulations,\nwhereas those from MFC and MSAu deviate significantly. Using DFT we calculated\nthe solvation force, which relates directly to surface force experiments. We\nfind that its decay length is neither qualitatively nor quantitatively close to\nthe large decay lengths measured in experiments and conclude that the latter\ncannot be accounted for by the primitive model. The anomalously large decay\nlengths found in surface force measurements require an explanation that lies\nbeyond primitive models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 2020 16:42:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Mar 2021 09:54:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-02"}

The field strength is varied up to a maximum value of 320 mT\n(Ha = 2470, Q = 6.11 \\times 10^6). The magnetic field forces the flow to form\ntwo-dimensional rolls parallel to the direction of the field lines. The\nexperiments confirm the predictions made by Busse and Clever (J.

A transition\nfrom the steady to a time-dependent oscillatory flow occurs when Ra exceeds a\ncritical value for a given Chandrasekhar number Q, which is also equivalent to\na reduction of the ratio Q/Ra. Our measurements reveal that the first\ndeveloping oscillations are clearly of two-dimensional nature, in particular a\nmutual increase and decrease in the size of adjacent convection rolls is\nobserved without the formation of any detectable gradients in the velocity\nfield along the magnetic field direction. At a ratio of Q/Ra = 1, the first 3D\nstructures appear, which initially manifest themselves in a slight inclination\nof the rolls with respect to the magnetic field direction. Immediately in the\ncourse of this, there arise also disturbances in the spaces between adjacent\nconvection rolls, which are advected along the rolls due to the secondary flow\ndriven by Ekman pumping.

A hardware-assisted\nintra-process isolation mechanism enables software developers to partition a\nprocess into isolated components and in turn secure sensitive data from\nuntrusted components. However, most of the existing hardware-assisted\nintra-process isolation mechanisms in modern processors, such as ARM and IBM\nPower, rely on costly kernel operations for switching between trusted and\nuntrusted domains. Recently, Intel introduced a new hardware feature for\nintra-process memory isolation, called Memory Protection Keys (MPK), which\nenables a user-space process to switch the domains in an efficient way. While\nthe efficiency of Intel MPK enables developers to leverage it for common use\ncases such as Code-Pointer Integrity, the limited number of unique domains (16)\nprohibits its use in cases such as OpenSSL where a large number of domains are\nrequired. Moreover, Intel MPK suffers from the protection key use-after-free\nvulnerability. To address these shortcomings, in this paper, we propose an\nefficient intra-process isolation technique for the RISC-V open ISA, called\nSealPK, which supports up to 1024 unique domains. SealPK prevents the\nprotection key use-after-free problem by leveraging a lazy de-allocation\napproach. To further strengthen SealPK, we devise three novel sealing features\nto protect the allocated domains, their associated pages, and their permissions\nfrom modifications or tampering by an attacker. To demonstrate the feasibility\nof our design, we implement SealPK on a RISC-V Rocket processor, provide the OS\nsupport for it, and prototype our design on an FPGA. We demonstrate the\nefficiency of SealPK by leveraging it to implement an isolated shadow stack on\nour FPGA prototype.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 2020 16:58:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-07"}

To this end, we propose\nNimble, a DL execution engine that runs GPU tasks in parallel with minimal\nscheduling overhead. Nimble introduces a novel technique called ahead-of-time\n(AoT) scheduling.

We find that, under slip\nboundary conditions, the wall induces the accumulation of negatively charged\ntopological defects in its vicinity, resulting in the formation of a\ntopological boundary layer that polarizes the wall. While the dynamics of wall\nand bulk defects are decoupled, we find that the active boundary layer\ninfluences the overall dynamics of the system, to the point of fully\ncontrolling the behavior of the active nematic in situations of strong\nconfinement. Finally, we show that wall defects exhibit behaviors that are\nessentially different from those of their bulk counterparts, such as high\nmotility or the ability to recombine with another defect of like-sign\ntopological charge.

Most recent Siamese-based trackers typically employ a\ndepth-wise cross-correlation (DW-XCorr) to obtain multi-channel correlation\ninformation from the two feature maps (target and search region). However,\nDW-XCorr has several limitations within Siamese-based tracking: it can easily\nbe fooled by distractors, has fewer activated channels, and provides weak\ndiscrimination of object boundaries. Further, DW-XCorr is a handcrafted\nparameter-free module and cannot fully benefit from offline learning on\nlarge-scale data. We propose a learnable module, called the asymmetric\nconvolution (ACM), which learns to better capture the semantic correlation\ninformation in offline training on large-scale data. Different from DW-XCorr\nand its predecessor(XCorr), which regard a single feature map as the\nconvolution kernel, our ACM decomposes the convolution operation on a\nconcatenated feature map into two mathematically equivalent operations, thereby\navoiding the need for the feature maps to be of the same size (width and\nheight)during concatenation. Our ACM can incorporate useful prior information,\nsuch as bounding-box size, with standard visual features. Furthermore, ACM can\neasily be integrated into existing Siamese trackers based on DW-XCorror XCorr.\nTo demonstrate its generalization ability, we integrate ACM into three\nrepresentative trackers: SiamFC, SiamRPN++, and SiamBAN.

Focusing on a general dynamical resource theory of quantum channels,\nhere we consider tasks of one-shot resource distillation and dilution with a\nsingle copy of the resource.

The strategy becomes optimal with\nconverged bounds when the channel robustness is finite and measures of the\ntarget resource collapse to the same value. The single-shot result also applies\nto asymptotic parallel manipulation of channels to obtain asymptotic resource\nconversion rates.

In this\npaper, we find that BN saturates at extreme large batch sizes, i.e., 128 images\nper worker, i.e., GPU, as well and propose that the degradation/saturation of\nBN at small/extreme large batch sizes is caused by noisy/confused statistic\ncalculation.

This forces the agent to make\ndecisions individually at each timestep in training, and hence, limits the\nscalability to continuous, high-dimensional, and long-horizon tasks. In\ncontrast, research in classical robotics has, for a long time, exploited\ndynamical systems as a policy representation to learn robot behaviors via\ndemonstrations. These techniques, however, lack the flexibility and\ngeneralizability provided by deep learning or reinforcement learning and have\nremained under-explored in such settings. In this work, we begin to close this\ngap and embed the structure of a dynamical system into deep neural\nnetwork-based policies by reparameterizing action spaces via second-order\ndifferential equations. We propose Neural Dynamic Policies (NDPs) that make\npredictions in trajectory distribution space as opposed to prior policy\nlearning methods where actions represent the raw control space. The embedded\nstructure allows end-to-end policy learning for both reinforcement and\nimitation learning setups.

It also serves as a\nvaluable cosmological probe by allowing us to measure the Hubble constant\nindependently of other methods. These applications all require the difficult\ntask of inverting the lens equation and simultaneously reconstructing the mass\nprofile of the lens along with the original light profile of the unlensed\nsource. As there is no reason for either the lens or the source to be simple,\nwe need methods that both invert the lens equation with a large number of\ndegrees of freedom and also enforce a well-controlled regularisation that\navoids the appearance of spurious structures. This can be beautifully\naccomplished by representing signals in wavelet space. Building on the Sparse\nLens Inversion Technique (SLIT), in this work we present an improved\nsparsity-based method that describes lensed sources using wavelets and\noptimises over the parameters given an analytical lens mass profile. We apply\nour technique on simulated HST and E-ELT data, as well as on real HST images of\nlenses from the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) sample, assuming a lens model. We show\nthat wavelets allow us to reconstruct lensed sources containing detailed\nsubstructures when using both present-day data and high-resolution images from\nfuture thirty-meter-class telescopes. Wavelets moreover provide a much more\ntractable solution in terms of quality and computation time compared to using a\nsource model that combines smooth analytical profiles and shapelets. Requiring\nvery little human interaction, our pixel-based technique fits into the effort\nto devise automated modelling schemes. It can be incorporated in the standard\nworkflow of sampling analytical lens model parameters. The method, which we\ncall SLITronomy, is freely available as a new plug-in to the modelling software\nLenstronomy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 2020 19:00:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-31"}

QQMC is a general approach for calculating high-order perturbative\nexpansions in power of the electron-electron interaction strength. In contrast\nto conventional Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling, QQMC uses low-discrepancy\nsequences for a more uniform sampling of the multi-dimensional integrals\ninvolved and can potentially outperform Monte Carlo by several orders of\nmagnitudes. A core concept of QQMC is the a priori construction of a \"model\nfunction\" that approximates the integrand and is used to optimize the sampling\ndistribution. In this paper, we show that the model function concept extends to\na kernel approach for the computation of Green functions. We illustrate the\napproach on the Anderson impurity model and show that the scaling of the error\nwith the number of integrand evaluations $N$ is $\\sim 1/N^{0.86}$ in the best\ncases, and comparable to Monte Carlo scaling $\\sim 1/N^{0.5}$ in the worst\ncases. We find a systematic improvement over Monte Carlo sampling by at least\ntwo orders of magnitude while using a basic form of model function. Finally, we\ncompare QQMC results with calculations performed with the Fork Tensor Product\nState (FTPS) method, a recently developed tensor network approach for solving\nimpurity problems. Applying a simple Pad\\'e approximant for the series\nresummation, we find that QQMC matches the FTPS results beyond the perturbative\nregime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 2020 19:00:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-07"}

However, the regular K-means can only be applied in the input space\nand it is applicable when clusters are linearly separable. The kernel K-means,\nwhich extends K-means into the kernel space, is able to capture nonlinear\nstructures and identify arbitrarily shaped clusters. However, kernel methods\noften operate on the kernel matrix of the data, which scale poorly with the\nsize of the matrix or suffer from the high clustering cost due to the\nrepetitive calculations of kernel values. Another issue is that algorithms\naccess the data only through evaluations of $K(x_i, x_j)$, which limits many\nprocesses that can be done on data through the clustering task. This paper\nproposes a method to combine the advantages of the linear and nonlinear\napproaches by using driven corresponding approximate finite-dimensional feature\nmaps based on spectral analysis. Applying approximate finite-dimensional\nfeature maps were only discussed in the Support Vector Machines (SVM) problems\nbefore.

Much of the existing progress in multimodal\nlearning, however, focuses primarily on problems where the same set of\nmodalities are present at train and test time, which makes learning in\nlow-resource modalities particularly difficult. In this work, we propose\nalgorithms for cross-modal generalization: a learning paradigm to train a model\nthat can (1) quickly perform new tasks in a target modality (i.e.\nmeta-learning) and (2) doing so while being trained on a different source\nmodality. We study a key research question: how can we ensure generalization\nacross modalities despite using separate encoders for different source and\ntarget modalities? Our solution is based on meta-alignment, a novel method to\nalign representation spaces using strongly and weakly paired cross-modal data\nwhile ensuring quick generalization to new tasks across different modalities.\nWe study this problem on 3 classification tasks: text to image, image to audio,\nand text to speech. Our results demonstrate strong performance even when the\nnew target modality has only a few (1-10) labeled samples and in the presence\nof noisy labels, a scenario particularly prevalent in low-resource modalities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 2020 19:27:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-08"}

We address these limitations by using the fully nonlinear solver\nOceanWave3D to establish the DeRisk database, a large dataset of extreme waves\nkinematics in a two-dimensional domain. From the database, which is open and\nfreely available, a designer can extract fully-nonlinear wave kinematics for a\nwave condition and water depth of interest by identifying a suitable\ncomputation in the database and, if needed, by Froude-scaling the kinematics.\n  The nonlinear solver is validated against the DeRisk model experiments at two\ndifferent water depths, $33.0 [m]$ and $20.0 [m]$, and an excellent agreement\nis found for the analyzed cases.

This approach was employed\nin search of dissipationless spin and valley transport, topological\ncharge-neutral currents, hydrodynamic flows and helical edge modes. Monolayer,\nbilayer, and few-layer graphene, transition-metal dichalcogenides, and moire\nsuperlattices were found to display pronounced nonlocal effects.

Utilizing superconducting quantum interference device\non a tip (SQUID-on-tip) for nanoscale thermal and scanning gate imaging, we\ndemonstrate that the commonly-occurring charge accumulation at graphene edges\nleads to giant nonlocality, producing narrow conductive channels that support\nlong-range currents. Unexpectedly, while the edge conductance has little impact\non the current flow in zero magnetic field, it leads to field-induced\ndecoupling between edge and bulk transport at moderate fields. The resulting\ngiant nonlocality both at charge neutrality and away from it produces exotic\nflow patterns in which charges can flow against the global electric field. We\nhave visualized surprisingly intricate patterns of nonlocal currents, which are\nsensitive to edge disorder.

When networks have strong community structure,\nnetwork grouping achieves the lower bound for two-stage testing procedures.

The effect of\nroughness was incorporated using a level-set/volume-of-fluid immersed boundary\nmethod. Turbulence statistics of five channel flows are compared, including one\nreference case with both walls smooth and four cases with smooth top walls and\nbottom walls with two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) sinusoidal\nroughnesses. Results reveal a strong dependence of the turbulence on the\nroughness topography and the associated shock patterns. Specifically, the 2D\ngeometries generate strong oblique shock waves that propagate across the\nchannel and are reflected back to the rough-wall side. These strong shocks are\nabsent in the smooth-wall channel and are significantly weaker in cases with 3D\nroughness geometries, replaced by weak shocklets. At the impingement locations\nof the shocks on the top wall in the 2D roughness cases, localized\naugmentations of turbulence shear production are observed. Such regions of\naugmented production also exist for the 3D cases, at a much weaker level. The\noblique shock waves are thought to be responsible for a more significant\nentropy generation for cases with 2D surfaces than those with 3D ones, leading\nto a higher irreversible heat generation and consequently higher temperature\nvalues in 2D roughness cases. In the present supersonic channels, the effects\nof roughness extend beyond the near-wall layer due to the shocks. This suggests\nthat outer layer similarity may not fully apply to a rough-wall supersonic\nturbulent flow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 2020 21:08:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Nov 2022 19:42:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-09"}

Among these compounds, LaB$_6$ has a special\nplace, being a traditional d-band metal without additional f- bands. In this\npaper we investigate the bulk electronic structure of LaB$_6$ using hard x-ray\nphotoemission spectroscopy, measuring both core-level and angle-resolved\nvalence-band spectra. By comparing La 3d core level spectra to cluster model\ncalculations, we identify well-screened peak residing at a lower binding energy\ncompared to the main poorly-screened peak; the relative intensity between these\npeaks depends on how strong the hybridization is between La and B atoms. We\nshow that the recoil effect, negligible in the soft x-ray regime, becomes\nprominent at higher kinetic energies for lighter elements, such as boron, but\nis still negligible for heavy elements, such as lanthanum. In addition, we\nreport the bulk-like band structure of LaB$_6$ determined by hard x-ray\nangle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (HARPES). We interpret HARPES\nexperimental results by the free-electron final-state calculations and by the\nmore precise one-step photoemission theory including matrix element and phonon\nexcitation effects. In addition, we consider the nature and the magnitude of\nphonon excitations in HARPES experimental data measured at different\ntemperatures and excitation energies. We demonstrate that one step theory of\nphotoemission and HARPES experiments provide, at present, the only approach\ncapable of probing true bulk-like electronic band structure of rare-earth\nhexaborides and strongly correlated materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 2020 21:43:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Jan 2021 20:27:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-26"}

However, this requires solving the distribution system state\nestimation (DSSE) jointly for both primary and secondary levels of distribution\ngrids, which is computationally complex and lacks scalability to large systems.\nTo achieve near real-time solutions for DSSE, we present a novel hierarchical\nreinforcement learning-aided framework: at the first layer, a weighted least\nsquares (WLS) algorithm solves the DSSE over primary medium-voltage feeders; at\nthe second layer, deep actor-critic (A-C) modules are trained for each\nsecondary transformer using measurement residuals to estimate the states of\nlow-voltage circuits and capture the impact of PVs at the grid-edge. While the\nA-C parameter learning process takes place offline, the trained A-C modules are\ndeployed online for fast secondary grid state estimation; this is the key\nfactor in scalability and computational efficiency of the framework. To\nmaintain monitoring accuracy, the two levels exchange boundary information with\neach other at the secondary nodes, including transformer voltages (first layer\nto second layer) and active/reactive total power injection (second layer to\nfirst layer). This interactive information passing strategy results in a\nclosed-loop structure that is able to track optimal solutions at both layers in\nfew iterations. Moreover, our model can handle the topology changes using the\nJacobian matrices of the first layer. We have performed numerical experiments\nusing real utility data and feeder models to verify the performance of the\nproposed framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 2020 22:38:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-08"}

Hybrid analog-digital\nbeamforming has been recognised as a promising approach for large-scale MIMO\nimplementations with a reduced number of costly and power-hungry RF chains. In\ncomparison to fully connected architecture, hybrid beamforming (HBF) with\npartially connected RF architecture is particularly appealing for the practical\nimplementation due to less complex RF power division and combining networks. In\nthis paper, we first formulate single- and multi-user rate maximization\nproblems as weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) and derive solutions for\nhybrid beamformers using alternating optimization. The algorithms are designed\nfor the full-array- and sub-array-based processing strategies of partially\nconnected HBF architecture. In addition to the rate maximizing WMMSE solutions,\nwe propose lower complexity sub-array-based zero-forcing algorithms. The\nperformance of the proposed algorithms is evaluated in two different channel\nmodels, i.e., a simple geometric model and a realistic statistical millimeter\nwave model known as NYUSIM. The performance results of the WMMSE HBF algorithms\nare meant to reveal the potential of partially connected HBF and serve as upper\nbounds for lower complexity methods. Numerical results imply that properly\ndesigned partially connected HBF has the potential to provide an good\ncompromise between hardware complexity and system performance in comparison to\nfully digital beamforming.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 2020 23:08:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-08"}

The choice of SPOD\nmodes as basis vectors is motivated by their optimality and space-time\ncoherence properties for statistically stationary flows. This work follows the\nmodeling paradigm that complex nonlinear fluid dynamics can be approximated as\nstochastically forced linear systems. The proposed stochastic two-level\nSPOD-Galerkin model governs a compound state consisting of the modal expansion\ncoefficients and forcing coefficients. In the first level, the modal expansion\ncoefficients are advanced by the forced linearized Navier-Stokes operator under\nthe linear time-invariant assumption.

Trained with smaller data, these methods end up severely lacking\nrobustness (e.g. to disfluencies and out-of-domain input), and often just have\ntoo little generalisation power.

Firstly, we study two orthogonal approaches to dialogue:\nlinguistically informed and machine learning-based - from the data efficiency\nperspective. We outline the steps to obtain data-efficient solutions with\neither approach. We then introduce two data-efficient models for dialogue\nresponse generation: the Dialogue Knowledge Transfer Network based on latent\nvariable dialogue representations, and the hybrid Generative-Retrieval\nTransformer model (ranked first at the DSTC 8 Fast Domain Adaptation task).\nNext, we address the problem of robustness given minimal data.

Although popular computer vision datasets like\nCityscapes, MS-COCO, PASCAL provide good benchmarks for several tasks (e.g.\nimage classification, segmentation, object detection), these datasets are\nhardly suitable for post disaster damage assessments. On the other hand,\nexisting natural disaster datasets include mainly satellite imagery which have\nlow spatial resolution and a high revisit period. Therefore, they do not have a\nscope to provide quick and efficient damage assessment tasks. Unmanned Aerial\nVehicle(UAV) can effortlessly access difficult places during any disaster and\ncollect high resolution imagery that is required for aforementioned tasks of\ncomputer vision. To address these issues we present a high resolution UAV\nimagery, FloodNet, captured after the hurricane Harvey. This dataset\ndemonstrates the post flooded damages of the affected areas. The images are\nlabeled pixel-wise for semantic segmentation task and questions are produced\nfor the task of visual question answering. FloodNet poses several challenges\nincluding detection of flooded roads and buildings and distinguishing between\nnatural water and flooded water.

The goal is to minimize the long-run average age of information\n(AoI) at the destination under an average energy constraint. We consider two\npractical cases to obtain channel state information (CSI): (i) \\emph{without\nchannel sensing} and (ii) \\emph{with delayed channel sensing}. For case (i),\nthe channel state is revealed when an ACK/NACK is received at the transmitter\nfollowing a transmission, but when no transmission occurs, the channel state is\nnot revealed. Thus, we have to design schemes that balance tradeoffs across\nenergy, AoI, channel exploration, and channel exploitation. The problem is\nformulated as a constrained partially observable Markov decision process\nproblem (POMDP). To reduce algorithm complexity, we show that the optimal\npolicy is a randomized mixture of no more than two stationary deterministic\npolicies each of which is of a threshold-type in the belief on the channel. For\ncase (ii), (delayed) CSI is available at the transmitter via channel sensing.\nIn this case, the tradeoff is only between the AoI and energy consumption and\nthe problem is formulated as a constrained MDP. The optimal policy is shown to\nhave a similar structure as in case (i) but with an AoI associated threshold.\nFinally, the performance of the proposed structure-aware algorithms is\nevaluated numerically and compared with a Greedy policy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Dec 2020 06:33:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 31 Jan 2021 23:56:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-02"}

All the newly found fermions are observed at\n$\\Gamma$ and $R$ points similar to other theoretical and experimental reports.\nOur DFT+DMFT calculations for the bulk states have shown one extra hole pocket\nat $M$ point. Both coherent and incoherent features have been observed in the\nspectra of bulk CoSi. This indicates the presence of\nquasiparticle-quasiparticle (QP-QP) interactions which is eventually affecting\nthe lifetime ($\\tau$) of exotic fermionic QPs. For instance, the calculated\n$\\tau$ for QPs at $\\omega \\sim $ -30 and -186 mev are found to be $\\sim\n10^{-9}$ s and $\\sim 10^{-12}$ s, respectively when SOC is not considered.\nHowever, $G_0W_0$ corrections have shown $\\tau$ for spin-1 fermionic QP at\n$\\Gamma$ to be infinite while for double Weyl fermionic QP at $R$ point to be\n$\\sim 10^{-12}$ s. Their effective masses ($m^*$) have also been calculated as\n$\\sim$ 1.60 and 1.64 at $\\Gamma$ and $R$ points, respectively. Furthermore, the\nspectral functions at T = 100 K of (001) surface have also shown both coherent\nand incoherent features.

To\nobtain spatiotemporal features simultaneously, we design a generic\nrepresentation of skeleton sequences for action recognition and propose a novel\nmodel called Temporal Graph Networks (TGN). Secondly, the adjacency matrix of\nthe graph describing the relation of joints is mostly dependent on the physical\nconnection between joints. To appropriately describe the relations between\njoints in the skeleton graph, we propose a multi-scale graph strategy, adopting\na full-scale graph, part-scale graph, and core-scale graph to capture the local\nfeatures of each joint and the contour features of important joints.\nExperiments were carried out on two large datasets and results show that TGN\nwith our graph strategy outperforms state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Dec 2020 08:08:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-08"}

From TBW fits, the kinetic freeze-out temperature\nat the same centrality shows a weak dependence of collision energy between 7.7\nand 39 GeV, while it decreases as collision energy continues to increase up to\n5.02 TeV. The radial flow is found to be consistent with zero in peripheral\ncollisions at RHIC energies but sizable at LHC energies and central collisions\nat all RHIC energies. We also observed that the strange hadrons, with higher\ntemperature and similar radial flow, approach equilibrium more quickly from\nperipheral to central collisions than light hadrons. The dependence of\ntemperature and flow velocity on non-equilibrium parameter ($q-1$) is\ncharacterized by two second-order polynomials. Both $a$ and $d\\xi$ from the\npolynomials fit, related to the influence of the system bulk viscosity,\nincrease toward lower RHIC energies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Dec 2020 09:31:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Sep 2021 04:03:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-03"}

The\nwind-torus interactions drive two kinds of shocks: the bow shocks at the\nwindward side of the torus clouds, and the cloud shocks inside the torus\nclouds.

After carefully analyzing the numeral results, we conclude that\nthe numerical results obtained by the AIM and the time-domain integration\nmethod are closer to the theoretical values than those obtained by the WKB\nmethod and the Mashhoon method, when the $\\theta$ and $\\eta$ are large.\nMoreover, through a numerical fitting, we obtain that the functional\nrelationship between the threshold $\\eta_c$ and the non-commutative parameter\n$\\theta$ satisfies $\\eta_{c}=a\\theta^{b}+c$ for a fixed $l$ approximately. We\nfind that the stability of dynamics can be ensured in the $\\eta<\\eta_c(\\theta,\nl)$ region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Dec 2020 10:56:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Nov 2021 13:02:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-17"}

In smaller and/or relaxed\nclusters, where no halos are detected, one can instead place upper limits to a\npossible radio emission. Detections and upper limits are both crucial to\nconstrain theoretical models for the generation of radio halos. The upper\nlimits are model dependent for radio interferometers and thus the process of\nobtaining these is tedious to perform manually. In this paper, we present a\nPython based tool to automate this process of estimating the upper limits. The\ntool allows users to create radio halos with defined parameters like physical\nsize, redshift and brightness model. A family of radio halo models with a range\nof flux densities, decided based on the rms noise of the image, is then\ninjected into the parent visibility file and imaged. The halo injected image\nand the original image are then compared to check for the radio halo detection\nusing a threshold on the detected excess flux density. Injections separated by\nfiner differences in the flux densities are carried out once the coarse range\nwhere the upper limit is likely to be located has been identified. The code\nrecommends an upper limit and provides a range of images for manual inspection.\nThe user may then decide on the upper limit. We discuss the advantages and\nlimitations of this tool. A wider usage of this tool in the context of the\nongoing and upcoming all sky surveys with the LOFAR and SKA is proposed with\nthe aim of constraining the physics of radio halo formation.

However, due to the expensive evaluation cost of\nmodels (e.g., training deep learning models or training models on large\ndatasets), vanilla Bayesian optimization (BO) is typically computationally\ninfeasible. To alleviate this issue, Hyperband (HB) utilizes the early stopping\nmechanism to speed up configuration evaluations by terminating those\nbadly-performing configurations in advance. This leads to two kinds of quality\nmeasurements: (1) many low-fidelity measurements for configurations that get\nearly-stopped, and (2) few high-fidelity measurements for configurations that\nare evaluated without being early stopped. The state-of-the-art HB-style\nmethod, BOHB, aims to combine the benefits of both BO and HB. Instead of\nsampling configurations randomly in HB, BOHB samples configurations based on a\nBO surrogate model, which is constructed with the high-fidelity measurements\nonly. However, the scarcity of high-fidelity measurements greatly hampers the\nefficiency of BO to guide the configuration search.

Designing MFES-HB is not trivial as the low-fidelity measurements\ncan be biased yet informative to guide the configuration search. Thus we\npropose to build a Multi- Fidelity Ensemble Surrogate (MFES) based on the\ngeneralized Product of Experts framework, which can integrate useful\ninformation from multi-fidelity measurements effectively.

The effect of\na mainshock in the form of aftershocks can be felt throughout the recovery\nphase of stock price. As the market remains in stress during recovery, any\nsmall perturbation leads to a relatively smaller aftershock. The duration of\nthe recovery phase has been estimated using structural break analysis. We have\ncarried out statistical analyses of the 1987 stock market crash, 2008 financial\ncrisis and 2020 COVID-19 pandemic considering the actual crash-times of the\nmainshock and aftershocks.

The result is consistent with the present\nrecovery of the market from the COVID-19 pandemic.

To\nbridge this gap, we propose ParaNet, a novel end-to-end deep learning\nframework, for representing 3D point clouds in a completely regular and nearly\nlossless manner. To be specific, ParaNet converts an irregular 3D point cloud\ninto a regular 2D color image, named point geometry image (PGI), where each\npixel encodes the spatial coordinates of a point. In contrast to conventional\nregular representation modalities based on multi-view projection and\nvoxelization, the proposed representation is differentiable and reversible.\nTechnically, ParaNet is composed of a surface embedding module, which\nparameterizes 3D surface points onto a unit square, and a grid resampling\nmodule, which resamples the embedded 2D manifold over regular dense grids. Note\nthat ParaNet is unsupervised, i.e., the training simply relies on\nreference-free geometry constraints. The PGIs can be seamlessly coupled with a\ntask network established upon standard and mature techniques for 2D\nimages/videos to realize a specific task for 3D point clouds. We evaluate\nParaNet over shape classification and point cloud upsampling, in which our\nsolutions perform favorably against the existing state-of-the-art methods.

The proposed system achieves a win-win situation, i.e. improving\nthe spectrum efficiency of the CUs that cannot meet their rate requirement\nwhile providing spectrum access for D2D pairs. Unlike previous works, to reduce\nthe overhead, we design a novel two-timescale resource allocation scheme, in\nwhich the pairing between CUs and D2D pairs is decided at a long timescale and\ntransmission time for CU and D2D pair is determined at a short timescale.\nSpecifically, to characterize the long-term payoff of each potential CU-D2D\npair, we investigate the optimal cooperation policy to decide the transmission\ntime based on the instantaneous channel state information (CSI). We prove that\nthe optimal policy is a threshold policy which can be achieved via binary\nsearch. Since CUs and D2D pairs are self-interested, they are paired only when\nthey agree to cooperate mutually. Therefore, to study the cooperation behaviors\nof CUs and D2D pairs, we formulate the pairing problem as a matching game,\nbased on the long-term payoff achieved by the optimal cooperation policy of\neach possible pairing. Furthermore, unlike most previous matching models in D2D\nnetworks, we allow transfer between CUs and D2D pairs to improve the\nperformance. To solve the pairing problem, a distributed algorithm is proposed,\nwhich converges to an \\epsilon-stable matching.

The sample\nconsists of 39 bursts, 117 pulses, and 1228 spectra. We confirm the general\ntrend that pulses become softer over time, with mainly the low-energy power-law\nindex $\\alpha$ becoming smaller. A few exceptions to this trend exist, with the\nhardest pulse occurring at late times. The first pulse in a burst is clearly\ndifferent from the later pulses; three-fourths of them violate the synchrotron\nline of death, while around half of them significantly prefer photospheric\nemission. These fractions decrease for subsequent pulses. We also find that in\ntwo-thirds of the pulses, the spectral parameters ($\\alpha$ and peak energy)\ntrack the light-curve variations.

We focus on the magnetically-dominated regime where tension of the\nbackground magnetic field lines exceeds the plasma rest mass by a factor\n$\\sigma_0 > 1$. In the simulations, turbulence is excited on a macroscopic\nscale $l_0$, and we observe that it develops by forming thin, dynamic current\nsheets on various scales. The deposited macroscopic energy dissipates by\nenergizing thermal and nonthermal particles. The particle energy distribution\nis shaped by impulsive acceleration in reconnecting current sheets, gradual\nstochastic acceleration, and radiative losses. We parameterize radiative\ncooling by the ratio $A$ of light-crossing time $l_0/c$ to a cooling timescale,\nand study the effect of increasing $A$ on the flare. When radiative losses are\nsufficiently weak, $A<\\sigma_0^{-1}$, the produced emission is dominated by\nstochastically accelerated particles, and the radiative power depends\nlogarithmically on $A$. The resulting flare radiation spectrum is broad and\nanisotropic. In the strong-cooling regime, $A>\\sigma_0^{-1}$, stochastic\nacceleration is suppressed while impulsive acceleration in the current sheets\ncontinues to operate. As $A$ increases further, the emission becomes dominated\nby thermal particles. Our simulations offer a new tool to study particle\nacceleration by turbulence, especially at high energies, where cooling competes\nwith acceleration. We find that the particle distribution is influenced by\nstrong intermittency of dissipation, and stochastic acceleration cannot be\ndescribed by a universal diffusion coefficient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Dec 2020 14:52:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Sep 2021 18:38:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-17"}

This pandemic has a devastating socio-economic impact\nacross the globe. On the other hand, due to the pre-pandemic aggressive\nurbanization with the steep population growth, modern cities also facing\nsubstantial challenges. Hence, usage of technology is anticipated to be the\nprecondition for adaptive, resilient, and sustainable development, where, a\nsmart city is defined as the accumulated advanced ideas of information and\ntechnology aiming to ensure a decent quality of life for the inhabitants.\nConsidering the current growth rate of 1.9 percent, the projected population of\nBangladesh will exceed 180 million in 2026. It is also speculated that Dhaka\nbeing the capital will be populated with 14 million inhabitants. Moreover,\nDhaka has already been labeled as the most densely populated city in the world.\nThus, concerned authorities are facing enormous challenges to provide and\nensure fundamental services to the in-habitants. Therefore, this has become the\nneed of the hour to conceptualize an information and communication\ntechnology-driven smart city for Bangladesh. A smart city may contain numerous\ncomponents; however, the proposed framework identifies seven components and\nservices for smart cities in Bangladesh. These are healthcare, education,\ntransportation, public safety, real estate, utilities, and city administration.\nDiscussions on these components are carried out in this paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Dec 2020 15:34:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-08"}

In this, a powerful and\nresource-rich edge device such as a smartphone or a Wi-Fi gateway is\ntransformed into a personal edge, collaborating with multiple devices to offer\nremarkable sensory al eapplications, while harnessing the power of locality,\navailability, and proximity. Naturally, this transformation pushes us to\nrethink how to construct accurate, robust, and efficient sensory systems at\npersonal edge. For instance, how do we build a reliable activity tracker with\nmultiple on-body IMU-equipped devices? While the accuracy of sensing models is\nimproving, their runtime performance still suffers, especially under this\nemerging multi-device, personal edge environments. Two prime caveats that\nimpact their performance are device and data variabilities, contributed by\nseveral runtime factors, including device availability, data quality, and\ndevice placement. To this end, we present SensiX, a personal edge platform that\nstays between sensor data and sensing models, and ensures best-effort inference\nunder any condition while coping with device and data variabilities without\ndemanding model engineering. SensiX externalises model execution away from\napplications, and comprises of two essential functions, a translation operator\nfor principled mapping of device-to-device data and a quality-aware selection\noperator to systematically choose the right execution path as a function of\nmodel accuracy. We report the design and implementation of SensiX and\ndemonstrate its efficacy in developing motion and audio-based multi-device\nsensing systems. Our evaluation shows that SensiX offers a 7-13% increase in\noverall accuracy and up to 30% increase across different environment dynamics\nat the expense of 3mW power overhead.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 2020 23:06:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-14"}

This method enables the developed model to find a more appropriate\nevacuation area design, among others regarding safety due to selecting the best\nexit door location among many suggested locations. This method is completely\ndependent on the selected model's output, i.e., the evacuation time for each\nindividual within the evacuation process. The new method finds an average of\nthe evacuees' evacuation times of each exit door location; then, based on the\naverage evacuation time, it decides which exit door location would be the best\nexit door to be used for evacuation by the evacuees. To validate the method,\nvarious designs for the evacuation area with various written scenarios were\nused. The results showed that the model with this new method could predict a\nproper exit door location among many suggested locations. Lastly, from the\nresults of this research using the integration of this newly proposed method, a\nnew capability for the selected model in terms of safety allowed the right\ndecision in selecting the finest design for the evacuation area among other\ndesigns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 2020 18:25:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-17"}
