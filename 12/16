Due to its infinitely many covering groups\nthe resulting (\"symplectic\") spectrum of the associated quantum Hamiltonian is\ngiven by {hbar omega (n+b), n =0,1,...; b in (0,1]}, in contrast to the\n\"orthodox\" spectrum {hbar omega (n+1/2)}.\n  The potentially most important implications concern the vibrations of\ndiatomic molecules in the infrared, e.g. those of molecular hydrogen H_2. Those\nsymplectic spectra of the HO may provide a simultaneous key to two outstanding\nastrophysical puzzles, namely the nature of dark (vacuum) energy and that of\ndark matter: To the former because the zero-point energy b hbar omega of free\nelectromagnetic wave oscillator modes can be extremely small > 0 (b ca.\nexp(-35) for the measured dark energy density). And a key to the dark matter\nproblem because the quantum zero-point energies of the Born-Oppenheimer\npotentials in which the two nuclei of H_2 or the nuclei of other primordial\ndiatomic molecules vibrate can be lower, too, and, therefore, may lead to\nspectrally detuned \"dark\" H_2 molecules during the \"Dark Ages\" of the universe\nand forming WIMPs in the hypothesized sense. All results appear to be in\nsurprisingly good agreement with the LambdaCDM model of the universe. Besides\nlaboratory experiments the search for 21-cm radio signals from the Dark Ages of\nthe universe and other astrophysical observations can help to explore those\nhypothetical implications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2020 16:39:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-16"}

However, the existing DTA models do not explicitly\ndescribe one's selection of driving velocity on a road link. Driving velocity\nchoice may not be crucial for modeling the movement of human drivers but it is\na must-have control to maneuver AVs. In this paper, we aim to develop a\ngame-theoretic model to solve for AVs's optimal driving strategies of velocity\ncontrol in the interior of a road link and route choice at a junction node. To\nthis end, we will first reinterpret the DTA problem as an N-car differential\ngame and show that this game can be tackled with a general mean field\ngame-theoretic framework. The developed mean field game is challenging to solve\nbecause of the forward and backward structure for velocity control and the\ncomplementarity conditions for route choice. An efficient algorithm is\ndeveloped to address these challenges. The model and the algorithm are\nillustrated on the Braess network and the OW network with a single destination.\nOn the Braess network, we first compare the LWR based DTA model with the\nproposed game and find that the driving and routing control navigates AVs with\noverall lower costs. We then compare the total travel cost without and with the\nmiddle link and find that the Braess paradox may still arise under certain\nconditions.

The excitonic insulator is one of the exotic\nphases of interacting electrons, produced by the Coulomb attraction between a\nsmall and equal number of electrons and holes, leading to the spontaneous\nformation of exciton pairs in narrow-gap semiconductors/semimetals.

An\nimportant practical aspect that is not addressed in the current literature is\nhow to analyze and fix fail cases where the use of quantization results in\nexcessive degradation. In this paper, we present a simple analytic framework\nthat breaks down overall degradation to its per layer contributions. We analyze\nmany common networks and observe that a layer's contribution is determined by\nboth intrinsic (local) factors - the distribution of the layer's weights and\nactivations - and extrinsic (global) factors having to do with the the\ninteraction with the rest of the layers. Layer-wise analysis of existing\nquantization schemes reveals local fail-cases of existing techniques which are\nnot reflected when inspecting their overall performance. As an example, we\nconsider ResNext26 on which SoTA post-training quantization methods perform\npoorly. We show that almost all of the degradation stems from a single layer.\nThe same analysis also allows for local fixes - applying a common weight\nclipping heuristic only to this layer reduces degradation to a minimum while\napplying the same heuristic globally results in high degradation. More\ngenerally, layer-wise analysis allows for a more nuanced examination of how\nquantization affects the network, enabling the design of better performing\nschemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2020 16:57:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-16"}

Even if the overall agreement with the\nexperimental data is good, still some discrepancies exist on the relic\nabundances of ${}^7$Li and ${}^6$Li. In order to exclude or confirm these\nscenarios, the BBN model needs precise input parameters, in particular the\ncross-sections of the BBN nuclear reaction network. However, the suppression of\nthe cross-sections due to the Coulomb barrier makes the measurement very\ndifficult and so affected by large systematic errors.

A hypothetical state in $^{12}\\mathrm{C}$ at 7.458 MeV excitation\nenergy, comprising of a loose structure of three $\\alpha$-particles in mutual\ntwo-body resonance, has been suggested in the literature to correspond to an\nEfimov state in nuclear physics. The existence of such a state has not been\ndemonstrated experimentally. Method: Using the combined data sets from two\nrecent experiments, one with the TexAT TPC to measure $\\alpha$-decay and the\nother with Gammasphere to measure $\\gamma$-decay of states in $^{12}\\mathrm{C}$\npopulated by $^{12}\\mathrm{N}$ and $^{12}\\mathrm{B}$ $\\beta$-decay\nrespectively, we achieve high sensitivity to states in close-proximity to the\n$\\alpha$-threshold in $^{12}\\mathrm{C}$.

Purpose: The direct\ndecay of the Hoyle state into three $\\alpha$-particles, rather than through the\n$^{8}\\mathrm{Be}$ ground state, can be identified by studying the energy\npartition of the 3 $\\alpha$-particles arising from the decay. This paper\nprovides details on the break-up mechanism of the Hoyle stating using a new\nexperimental technique. Method: By using beta-delayed charged-particle\nspectroscopy of $^{12}\\mathrm{N}$ using the TexAT (Texas Active Target) TPC, a\nhigh-sensitivity measurement of the direct 3 $\\alpha$ decay ratio can be\nperformed without contributions from pile-up events. Results: A Bayesian\napproach to understanding the contribution of the direct components via a\nlikelihood function shows that the direct component is $<0.043\\%$ at the 95\\%\nconfidence level (C.L.). This value is in agreement with several other studies\nand here we can demonstrate that a small non-sequential component with a decay\nfraction of about $10^{-4}$ is most likely. Conclusion: The measurement of the\nnon-sequential component of the Hoyle state decay is performed in an almost\nmedium-free reaction for the first time. The derived upper-limit is in\nagreement with previous studies and demonstrates sensitivity to the absolute\nbranching ratio. Further experimental studies would need to be combined with\nrobust microscopic theoretical understanding of the decay dynamics to provide\nadditional insight into the idea of the Hoyle state as an $\\alpha$-condensate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2020 17:27:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-16"}

In any quantum\nfield theory involving scalar fields and multiple, highly differing mass\nscales, it is in general not possible to choose a single renormalization scale\nthat will remove all the large logarithms in the effective potential. In this\npaper, we focus on the so-called decoupling method, which freezes the effects\nof heavy particles on the renormalization group running of the light degrees of\nfreedom at low energies. We study this for a simple two-scalar theory and find\nthat, while the decoupling method leads to an acceptable and convergent\neffective potential, the method does not solve the fine-tuning problem that is\ninherent to the hierarchy problem of multi-scale theories. We also consider an\nalternative implementation of the decoupling approach, which gives different\nresults for the shape of the potential, but still leads to similar conclusions\non the amount of fine-tuning in the model.

These results establish a\nclear link between electronic nematicity, the pseudogap, and its associated\nquantum criticality in overdoped cuprates. Our findings anticipate that\nelectronic nematicity may play a larger role in understanding the cuprate phase\ndiagram than previously recognized, possibly having a crucial role in the\nphenomenology of the pseudogap phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2020 17:43:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Sep 2021 15:01:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-02"}

Combined with the orbital period, this\nhelium white dwarf is evidence of previous mass transfer by a red giant.\nDetailed models of the system evolution from a progenitor main-sequence binary,\nincluding mass transfer, are made using the Modules for Experiments in Stellar\nAstrophysics (MESA). Both of the progenitor stars are evolved in the\nsimulation. WOCS 5379 is well reproduced with a primary star of initial mass\n1.19 $M_{\\odot}$, whose core becomes the white dwarf. The secondary star\ninitially is 1.01 $M_{\\odot}$. 300 Myr ago, the secondary finished receiving\nmass from the donor, having moved beyond the NGC 188 turnoff as a 1.20\n$M_{\\odot}$ blue straggler. The successful model has a mass transfer efficiency\nof 22\\%. This non-conservative mass transfer is key to expanding the orbit fast\nenough to permit stable mass transfer. Even so, the mass transfer begins with a\nshort unstable phase, during which half of the accreted mass is transferred.\nWith increasing mass, the secondary evolves from a radiative core to a\nconvective core. The final blue straggler interior is remarkably similar to a\n2.1 Gyr-old 1.21 $M_{\\odot}$ main-sequence star at the same location in the HR\ndiagram. The white dwarf effective temperature is also reproduced, but the\nmodeled white dwarf mass of 0.33 $M_{\\odot}$ is smaller than the measured mass\nof 0.42 $M_{\\odot}$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2020 18:54:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-17"}

So far, an\nin situ, in-operando methodology to obtain these parameters self-consistently\nwithin a micro/nanodevice, and thereby identify its conduction regime, is\ncritically lacking. In this context, we exploit Sondheimer oscillations,\nsemi-classical magnetoresistance oscillations due to helical electronic motion,\nas a method to obtain $l_{MR}$ in micro-devices even when $l_{MR}\\gg d$. This\ngives information on the bulk $l_{MR}$ complementary to quantum oscillations,\nwhich are sensitive to all scattering processes. We extract $l_{MR}$ from the\nSondheimer amplitude in the topological semi-metal WP$_2$, at elevated\ntemperatures up to $T\\sim 50$~K, in a range most relevant for hydrodynamic\ntransport phenomena. Our data on micrometer-sized devices are in excellent\nagreement with experimental reports of the large bulk $l_{MR}$ and thus confirm\nthat WP$_2$ can be microfabricated without degradation. Indeed, the measured\nscattering rates match well with those of theoretically predicted\nelectron-phonon scattering, thus supporting the notion of strong momentum\nexchange between electrons and phonons in WP$_2$ at these temperatures. These\nresults conclusively establish Sondheimer oscillations as a quantitative probe\nof $l_{MR}$ in micro-devices in studying non-ohmic electron flow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2020 19:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-01"}

Furthermore, we employ the conformal-to-Kundt\nmetric ansatz that is valid for all static spherically symmetric spacetimes and\nleads to a considerable simplification of the field equations. We arrive at a\nset of two ordinary differential equations and study its solutions using the\nFrobenius-like approach of (infinite) power series expansions. While the\nindicial equations considerably restrict the set of possible leading powers,\ncareful analysis of higher-order terms is necessary to establish the existence\nof the corresponding classes of solutions. We thus obtain various non-Einstein\ngeneralizations of the Schwarzschild, (anti-)de Sitter [or (A)dS for short],\nNariai, and Pleba\\'{n}ski-Hacyan spacetimes. Interestingly, some classes of\nsolutions allow for an arbitrary value of $\\Lambda$, while other classes admit\nonly discrete values of $\\Lambda$. For most of these classes, we give recurrent\nformulas for all series coefficients. We determine which classes contain the\nSchwarzschild-(A)dS black hole as a special case and briefly discuss the\nphysical interpretation of the spacetimes. In the discussion of physical\nproperties, we naturally focus on the generalization of the Schwarzschild-(A)dS\nblack hole, namely the Schwarzschild-Bach-(A)dS black hole, which possesses one\nadditional Bach parameter.

We argue that the sensitivity of this process to gluon saturation\ncan be enhanced by tagging on a hadron (or jet) which carries a large fraction\n$z \\simeq 1$ of the longitudinal momentum of the virtual photon. This opens the\npossibility to study gluon saturation in relatively hard processes, where the\nvirtuality $Q^2$ is (much) larger than the target saturation momentum $Q_s^2$,\nbut such that $z(1-z)Q^2\\lesssim Q_s^2$. Working in the limit $z(1-z)Q^2\\ll\nQ_s^2$, we predict new phenomena which would signal saturation in the SIDIS\ncross-section. For sufficiently low transverse momenta $k_\\perp\\ll Q_s$ of the\nproduced particle, the dominant contribution comes from elastic scattering in\nthe black disk limit, which exposes the unintegrated quark distribution in the\nvirtual photon. For larger momenta $k_\\perp\\gtrsim Q_s$, inelastic collisions\ntake the leading role. They explore gluon saturation via multiple scattering,\nleading to a Gaussian distribution in $k_\\perp$ centred around $Q_s$. When\n$z(1-z)Q^2\\ll Q^2$, this results in a Cronin peak in the nuclear modification\nfactor (the $R_{pA}$ ratio) at moderate values of $x$. With decreasing $x$,\nthis peak is washed out by the high-energy evolution and replaced by nuclear\nsuppression ($R_{pA}<1$) up to large momenta $k_\\perp\\gg Q_s$. Still for\n$z(1-z)Q^2\\ll Q_s^2$, we also compute SIDIS cross-sections integrated over\n$k_\\perp$.

As\nthe first application of these methods to data, we validate that the\nassumptions made apply to the DES Y3 weak lensing source galaxies and develop a\nfull treatment of systematic uncertainties. Our method consists of combining\ninformation from three independent likelihood functions: Self-Organizing Map\n$p(z)$ (SOMPZ), a method for constraining redshifts from galaxy photometry;\nclustering redshifts (WZ), constraints on redshifts from cross-correlations of\ngalaxy density functions; and shear ratios (SR), which provide constraints on\nredshifts from the ratios of the galaxy-shear correlation functions at small\nscales. Finally, we describe how these independent probes are combined to yield\nan ensemble of redshift distributions encapsulating our full uncertainty. We\ncalibrate redshifts with combined effective uncertainties of $\\sigma_{\\langle z\n\\rangle}\\sim 0.01$ on the mean redshift in each tomographic bin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2020 19:30:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Jun 2021 16:01:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-30"}

In a typical asynchronous scheme, workers calculate\ngradients with respect to out-of-date optimization parameters while the master\nuses stale (i.e., delayed) gradients to update the parameters. While using\nstale gradients can slow the convergence, asynchronous methods speed up the\noverall optimization with respect to wall clock time by allowing more frequent\nupdates and reducing idling times. In this paper, we present a variable\nper-epoch minibatch scheme called Anytime Minibatch with Delayed Gradients\n(AMB-DG). In AMB-DG, workers compute gradients in epochs of a fixed time while\nthe master uses stale gradients to update the optimization parameters. We\nanalyze AMB-DG in terms of its regret bound and convergence rate. We prove that\nfor convex smooth objective functions, AMB-DG achieves the optimal regret bound\nand convergence rate. We compare the performance of AMB-DG with that of Anytime\nMinibatch (AMB) which is similar to AMB-DG but does not use stale gradients. In\nAMB, workers stay idle after each gradient transmission to the master until\nthey receive the updated parameters from the master while in AMB-DG workers\nnever idle. We also extend AMB-DG to the fully distributed setting. We compare\nAMB-DG with AMB when the communication delay is long and observe that AMB-DG\nconverges faster than AMB in wall clock time. We also compare the performance\nof AMB-DG with the state-of-the-art fixed minibatch approach that uses delayed\ngradients. We run our experiments on a real distributed system and observe that\nAMB-DG converges more than two times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2020 21:08:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-17"}

One such a paradigm, known as aggregate programming, builds on\ncomputational models inspired by field-based coordination. Existing models such\nas the field calculus capture interaction with neighbours by a so-called\n\"neighbouring field\" (a map from neighbours to values). This requires ad-hoc\nmechanisms to smoothly compose with standard values, thus complicating\nprogramming and introducing clutter in aggregate programs, libraries and\ndomain-specific languages (DSLs). To address this key issue we introduce the\nnovel notion of \"computation against a neighbour\", whereby the evaluation of\ncertain subexpressions of the aggregate program are affected by recent\ncorresponding evaluations in neighbours.

Meanwhile galaxies whose stellar dynamics would be classified as\n`regular rotators' based on their kinemetry are more common in relaxed groups.\nWe confirm that this dependency on group dynamical state remains valid at fixed\nstellar mass and Sersic index.

This is to be contrasted with correlations in an equilibrium\nfluid, whose range is typically just a few particle diameters. These NESS\ncorrelations were later confirmed by numerous experimental studies. Unlike\nlong-ranged correlations at critical points, these correlations are generic in\nthe sense that they exist for any temperature as long as the system is in a\nNESS. In equilibrium systems, generic long-ranged correlations are caused by\nspontaneously broken continuous symmetries and are associated with a\ngeneralized rigidity, which in turn leads to a new propagating excitation or\nmode. For example, in a solid, spatial rigidity leads to transverse sound\nwaves, while in a superfluid, phase rigidity leads to temperature waves known\nas second sound at finite temperatures, and phonons at zero temperature. More\ngenerally, long-ranged spatial correlations imply rigidity irrespective of\ntheir physical origin. This implies that a fluid in a NESS should also display\na type of rigidity and related anomalous transport behavior. Here we show that\nthis is indeed the case. For the particular case of a simple fluid in a\nconstant temperature gradient, the anomalous transport behavior takes the form\nof a super-diffusive spread of a constant-pressure temperature perturbation.

In this work, a novel method\nis introduced that facilitates systematical selection of multiple reference\ngauges from any given streamflow network.

Nevertheless, to learn a good meta-model for\nwithin-task fast adaptation, a single agent alone has to learn over many tasks,\nand this is the so-called 'cold-start' problem. Observing that in a multi-agent\nnetwork the learning tasks across different agents often share some model\nsimilarity, we ask the following fundamental question: \"Is it possible to\naccelerate the online meta-learning across agents via limited communication and\nif yes how much benefit can be achieved? \" To answer this question, we propose\na multi-agent online meta-learning framework and cast it as an equivalent\ntwo-level nested online convex optimization (OCO) problem. By characterizing\nthe upper bound of the agent-task-averaged regret, we show that the performance\nof multi-agent online meta-learning depends heavily on how much an agent can\nbenefit from the distributed network-level OCO for meta-model updates via\nlimited communication, which however is not well understood. To tackle this\nchallenge, we devise a distributed online gradient descent algorithm with\ngradient tracking where each agent tracks the global gradient using only one\ncommunication step with its neighbors per iteration, and it results in an\naverage regret $O(\\sqrt{T/N})$ per agent, indicating that a factor of\n$\\sqrt{1/N}$ speedup over the optimal single-agent regret $O(\\sqrt{T})$ after\n$T$ iterations, where $N$ is the number of agents. Building on this sharp\nperformance speedup, we next develop a multi-agent online meta-learning\nalgorithm and show that it can achieve the optimal task-average regret at a\nfaster rate of $O(1/\\sqrt{NT})$ via limited communication, compared to\nsingle-agent online meta-learning.

This work presents a framework, grounded in the field of\ninformation dynamics, for the model-free, continuous-time estimation of both\nundirected (symmetric) and directed (causal) interactions between pairs of\nspike trains. The framework decomposes the overall information exchanged\ndynamically between two point processes X and Y as the sum of the dynamic\nmutual information (dMI) between the histories of X and Y, plus the transfer\nentropy (TE) along the directions X->Y and Y->X.

The emergence of large-scale data\nsets provides great opportunities for better understanding of genomics,\nespecially gene regulation. Although each cell in the human body contains the\nsame set of DNA information, gene expression controls the functions of these\ncells by either turning genes on or off, known as gene expression levels. There\nare two important factors that control the expression level of each gene: (1)\nGene regulation such as histone modifications can directly regulate gene\nexpression. (2) Neighboring genes that are functionally related to or interact\nwith each other that can also affect gene expression level. Previous efforts\nhave tried to address the former using Attention-based model. However,\naddressing the second problem requires the incorporation of all potentially\nrelated gene information into the model. Though modern machine learning and\ndeep learning models have been able to capture gene expression signals when\napplied to moderately sized data, they have struggled to recover the underlying\nsignals of the data due to the nature of the data's higher dimensionality. To\nremedy this issue, we present SimpleChrome, a deep learning model that learns\nthe latent histone modification representations of genes. The features learned\nfrom the model allow us to better understand the combinatorial effects of\ncross-gene interactions and direct gene regulation on the target gene\nexpression. The results of this paper show outstanding improvements on the\npredictive capabilities of downstream models and greatly relaxes the need for a\nlarge data set to learn a robust, generalized neural network. These results\nhave immediate downstream effects in epigenomics research and drug development.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2020 23:30:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2020 05:58:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-18"}

When policies are parameterised as neural networks, i.e.\nNeuroevolution, QD tends to not scale well with parameter space dimensionality.\nOur hypothesis is that there exists a low-dimensional manifold embedded in the\npolicy parameter space, containing a high density of diverse and feasible\npolicies. We propose a novel approach to diversity-based policy search via\nNeuroevolution, that leverages learned latent representations of the policy\nparameters which capture the local structure of the data.

The presence of highly magnetized white dwarfs strengthens the\nhypothesis of buried fossil magnetic fields inside the core of evolved low-mass\nstars. If such a fossil field exists, it should affect the mixed modes of red\ngiants as they are sensitive to processes affecting the deepest layers of these\nstars. The impact of a magnetic field on dipolar oscillations modes was one of\nPr. Michael J. Thompson's research topics during the 90s when preparing the\nhelioseismic SoHO space mission. As the detection of gravity modes in the Sun\nis still controversial, the investigation of the solar oscillation modes did\nnot provide any hint of the existence of a magnetic field in the solar\nradiative core. Today we have access to the core of evolved stars thanks to the\nasteroseismic observation of mixed modes from CoRoT, Kepler, K2 and TESS\nmissions. The idea of applying and generalizing the work done for the Sun came\nfrom discussions with Pr.

The maps confirm the detection of thermal emission from the inner\ncircumgalactic medium (halo) and spatially resolve a dusty superbubble and a\ndust spur (filament). The dust temperature of the halo component is lower than\nthat of the disk but increases across a region of diameter ~8.0 kpc extending\nat least 7.7 kpc vertically from one side of the disk, a region we call a\nsuperbubble because of its association with thermal X-ray emission and a\nminimum in the synchrotron scaleheight. This outflow is breaking through the\nthick disk and developing into a galactic wind, which is of particular interest\nbecause NGC 891 is not considered a starburst galaxy; the star formation rate\nsurface density, 0.03 Msun/year per square kiloparsec, and gas fraction, just\n10% in the inner disk, indicate the threshold for wind formation is lower than\nprevious work has suggested. We conclude that the star formation surface\ndensity is sufficient for superbubble blowout into the halo, but the cosmic ray\nelectrons may play a critical role in determining whether this outflow develops\ninto a fountain or escapes from the gravitational potential. The high\ndust-to-gas ratio in the dust spur suggests the material was pulled out of NGC\n891 through the collision of a minihalo with the disk of NGC 891. We conclude\nthat NGC 891 offers an example of both feedback and satellite interactions\ntransporting dust into the halo of a typical galaxy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2020 01:31:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-10"}

Most of existing generation methods are based on the deep\ngenerative models, particularly, the generative adversarial networks (GAN)\nbased models. However, these deep generative models may suffer from the mode\ncollapse issue, which significantly degrades the diversity and quality of\ngenerated results. In this paper, we introduce a one-bit stroke encoding to\ncapture the key mode information of Chinese characters and then incorporate it\ninto CycleGAN, a popular deep generative model for Chinese font generation. As\na result we propose an efficient method called StrokeGAN, mainly motivated by\nthe observation that the stroke encoding contains amount of mode information of\nChinese characters. In order to reconstruct the one-bit stroke encoding of the\nassociated generated characters, we introduce a stroke-encoding reconstruction\nloss imposed on the discriminator. Equipped with such one-bit stroke encoding\nand stroke-encoding reconstruction loss, the mode collapse issue of CycleGAN\ncan be significantly alleviated, with an improved preservation of strokes and\ndiversity of generated characters. The effectiveness of StrokeGAN is\ndemonstrated by a series of generation tasks over nine datasets with different\nfonts. The numerical results demonstrate that StrokeGAN generally outperforms\nthe state-of-the-art methods in terms of content and recognition accuracies, as\nwell as certain stroke error, and also generates more realistic characters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2020 01:36:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 01:41:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-12"}

However, there are two issues that need to be\nresolved urgently. Firstly, numerous methods reduce the distributional shifts\nonly by aligning all the feature between the source and target domain, while\nignoring the private information of each domain. Secondly, DAOD should consider\nthe feature alignment on object existing regions in images. But redundancy of\nthe region proposals and background noise could reduce the domain\ntransferability. Therefore, we establish a Feature Separation and Alignment\nNetwork (FSANet) which consists of a gray-scale feature separation (GSFS)\nmodule, a local-global feature alignment (LGFA) module and a\nregion-instance-level alignment (RILA) module. The GSFS module decomposes the\ndistractive/shared information which is useless/useful for detection by a\ndual-stream framework, to focus on intrinsic feature of objects and resolve the\nfirst issue. Then, LGFA and RILA modules reduce the distributional shifts of\nthe multi-level features. Notably, scale-space filtering is exploited to\nimplement adaptive searching for regions to be aligned, and instance-level\nfeatures in each region are refined to reduce redundancy and noise mentioned in\nthe second issue.

As a result, the overall\nperformance may be degraded due to straggling workers. By introducing\nredundancy into computation, coded machine learning can effectively improve the\nruntime performance by recovering the final computation result through the\nfirst $k$ (out of the total $n$) workers who finish computation. While existing\nstudies focus on designing efficient coding schemes, the issue of designing\nproper incentives to encourage worker participation is still under-explored.\nThis paper studies the platform's optimal incentive mechanism for motivating\nproper workers' participation in coded machine learning, despite the incomplete\ninformation about heterogeneous workers' computation performances and costs. A\nkey contribution of this work is to summarize workers' multi-dimensional\nheterogeneity as a one-dimensional metric, which guides the platform's\nefficient selection of workers under incomplete information with a linear\ncomputation complexity. Moreover, we prove that the optimal recovery threshold\n$k$ is linearly proportional to the participator number $n$ if we use the\nwidely adopted MDS (Maximum Distance Separable) codes for data encoding.

However, the relationship between the ubiquitous disorder\nand the QSL behaviors is still unclear. Here, by performing comparative\nexperimental studies on two kagom\\'{e}-lattice QSL candidates,\nTm$_3$Sb$_3$Zn$_2$O$_{14}$ and Tm$_3$Sb$_3$Mg$_2$O$_{14}$, which are\nisostructural to each other but with strong and weak structural disorder,\nrespectively, we show unambiguously that the disorder can induce\nspin-liquid-like features. In particular, both compounds show dominant\nantiferromagnetic interactions with a Curie-Weiss temperature of -17.4 and\n-28.7 K for Tm$_3$Sb$_3$Zn$_2$O$_{14}$ and Tm$_3$Sb$_3$Mg$_2$O$_{14}$,\nrespectively, but remain disordered down to about 0.05 K. Specific heat results\nsuggest the presence of gapless magnetic excitations characterized by a\nresidual linear term. Magnetic excitation spectra obtained by inelastic neutron\nscattering (INS) at low temperatures display broad continua. All these\nobservations are consistent with those of a QSL. However, we find in\nTm$_3$Sb$_3$Zn$_2$O$_{14}$ which has strong disorder resulting from the random\nmixing of the magnetic Tm$^{3+}$ and nonmagnetic Zn$^{2+}$, that the low-energy\nmagnetic excitations observed in the specific heat and INS measurements are\nsubstantially enhanced, compared to those of Tm$_3$Sb$_3$Mg$_2$O$_{14}$ which\nhas much less disorder. We believe that the effective spins of the Tm$^{3+}$\nions in the Zn$^{2+}$/Mg$^{2+}$ sites give rise to the low-energy magnetic\nexcitations, and the amount of the random occupancy determines the excitation\nstrength. These results provide direct evidence of the mimicry of a QSL caused\nby disorder.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2020 03:39:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-17"}

In two-sided online marketplaces, both requirements are\ncalled into question. The Bernoulli randomized experiments are biased because\ntreatment units interfere with control units through market competition and\nviolate the \"stable unit treatment value assumption\"(SUTVA). The experimental\npower on at least one side of the market is often insufficient because of\ndisparate sample sizes on the two sides. Despite the important of online\nmarketplaces to the online economy and the crucial role experimentation plays\nin product improvement, there lacks an effective and practical solution to the\nbias and low power problems in marketplace experimentation. Our paper fills\nthis gap by proposing an experimental design that is unbiased in any\nmarketplace where buyers have a defined budget, which could be finite or\ninfinite. We show that it is more powerful than all other unbiased designs in\nliterature. We then provide generalizable system architecture for deploying\nthis design to online marketplaces.

With this, the question arises\nwhat steps need to be taken to elevate the current state of modeling\ncapabilities in order to address these deficiencies? This paper seeks to\naddress this question. We begin by reviewing the current state of combustion\nmodel approaches, our quest for improving existing models, the separation of\nerrors arising from numerical discretization and physical models, and ideas on\nmodel evaluations. We then proceed by examining concepts on quantitative model\nevaluations, requirements on predictability, quantities of interest, and\ncost/accuracy trade-offs.

In this paper, a novel reinitialization approach has\nbeen presented which circumvents these limitations by reformulating the\nreinitialization equation. With the reformulated procedure, the present\napproach is able to reinitialize the level set function without causing any\nunwanted movement of the interface contour. The unphysical patch formation away\nfrom the interface is also resolved here by avoiding the use of ill-conditioned\ncontour normal vectors. As a result of this measure, there is a significant\nimprovement in the mass conservation property. In addition, the simplified form\nof the new reinitialization equation enables one to choose a much larger time\nstep during the reinitialization iteration. Moreover, the new formulation also\nhelps in reducing the amount of numerical computations per time step, leading\nto an overall reduction in the computational efforts. In order to evaluate the\nperformance of the present formulation, a set of test problems involving\nreinitialization of stationary level set functions is carried out first. Then,\nthe efficacy of the proposed reinitialization scheme is demonstrated using a\nset of standard two-dimensional scalar advection based test problems and\nincompressible two-phase flow problems. Finally, the ability to deal with\ncomplex mesh types is demonstrated by solving a test problem on an unstructured\nmesh consisting of finite volume cells having triangular and quadrilateral\nshapes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2020 04:58:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-17"}

Recent empirical evidence indicates that the practice\nof overparameterization not only benefits training large models, but also\nassists - perhaps counterintuitively - building lightweight models.\nSpecifically, it suggests that overparameterization benefits model pruning /\nsparsification. This paper sheds light on these empirical findings by\ntheoretically characterizing the high-dimensional asymptotics of model pruning\nin the overparameterized regime. The theory presented addresses the following\ncore question: \"should one train a small model from the beginning, or first\ntrain a large model and then prune?\". We analytically identify regimes in\nwhich, even if the location of the most informative features is known, we are\nbetter off fitting a large model and then pruning rather than simply training\nwith the known informative features. This leads to a new double descent in the\ntraining of sparse models: growing the original model, while preserving the\ntarget sparsity, improves the test accuracy as one moves beyond the\noverparameterization threshold. Our analysis further reveals the benefit of\nretraining by relating it to feature correlations. We find that the above\nphenomena are already present in linear and random-features models. Our\ntechnical approach advances the toolset of high-dimensional analysis and\nprecisely characterizes the asymptotic distribution of over-parameterized\nleast-squares. The intuition gained by analytically studying simpler models is\nnumerically verified on neural networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2020 05:13:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-17"}

Previous work has considered a broad range of prediction models\nas well as features inferred from clickstream data to record session\ncharacteristics, and features inferred from user data to record customer\ncharacteristics.

However, in the\nde-identified data from a large European e-commerce platform available to us,\nmore than 50% of the sessions start as anonymous sessions. In this paper, we\nfocus on purchase prediction for both anonymous and identified sessions on an\ne-commerce platform. We start with a descriptive analysis of purchase vs.\nnon-purchase sessions. This analysis informs the definition of a feature-based\nmodel for purchase prediction for anonymous sessions and identified sessions;\nour models consider a range of session-based features for anonymous sessions,\nsuch as the channel type, the number of visited pages, and the device type.

In this work, we first describe a\nnovel implementation of the previous proximal alternating linearized minization\n(PALM) algorithm to solve this optimization problem. We then make enhancements\nto PALM, leading to a new algorithm named PALMNUT that combines the PALM\ntogether with Nesterov's momentum and a novel approach that relies on uncoupled\ncoordinatewise step sizes derived from coordinatewise Lipschitz-like bounds.\nTheoretically, we establish that a version of PALMNUT (without Nesterov's\nmomentum) monotonically decreases the objective function, leading to guaranteed\nconvergence in many cases of interest. Empirical results obtained in the\ncontext of magnetic resonance imaging demonstrate that PALMNUT has\ncomputational advantages over common existing approaches like alternating\nminimization.

Facial expressions are widely described as being automatic and thus\nhard to overtly influence. As such, they are a perfect measure for a better\nunderstanding of unintentional behavior cues about social-emotional cognitive\nprocesses. With this view, this study is concerned with the analysis of the\ndirection of emotional influence in dyadic dialogue based on facial expressions\nonly. We exploit computer vision capabilities along with causal inference\ntheory for quantitative verification of hypotheses on the direction of\nemotional influence, i.e., causal effect relationships, in dyadic dialogues. We\naddress two main issues. First, in a dyadic dialogue, emotional influence\noccurs over transient time intervals and with intensity and direction that are\nvariant over time. To this end, we propose a relevant interval selection\napproach that we use prior to causal inference to identify those transient\nintervals where causal inference should be applied. Second, we propose to use\nfine-grained facial expressions that are present when strong distinct facial\nemotions are not visible. To specify the direction of influence, we apply the\nconcept of Granger causality to the time series of facial expressions over\nselected relevant intervals. We tested our approach on newly, experimentally\nobtained data. Based on the quantitative verification of hypotheses on the\ndirection of emotional influence, we were able to show that the proposed\napproach is most promising to reveal the causal effect pattern in various\ninstructed interaction conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2020 07:52:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-17"}

According to recent\nstudies and our empirical observations, one possible reason is that some\neasy-to-fit patterns in the training data, such as frequently co-occurring word\ncombinations, dominate and harm pre-training, making it hard for the model to\nfit more complex information. We argue that mis-predictions can help locate\nsuch dominating patterns that harm language understanding. When a\nmis-prediction occurs, there should be frequently co-occurring patterns with\nthe mis-predicted word fitted by the model that lead to the mis-prediction. If\nwe can add regularization to train the model to rely less on such dominating\npatterns when a mis-prediction occurs and focus more on the rest more subtle\npatterns, more information can be efficiently fitted at pre-training. Following\nthis motivation, we propose a new language pre-training method, Mis-Predictions\nas Harm Alerts (MPA).

While it directly results in quantized response\ncoefficients in quantum systems, there has been no notion of quantized response\nin classical systems thus far. This is because quantized response has always\nbeen connected to topology via linear response theory that assumes a quantum\nmechanical ground state. Yet, classical systems can carry arbitrarily amounts\nof energy in each mode, even while possessing the same number of measurable\nedge modes as their topological winding. In this work, we discover the totally\nnew paradigm of quantized classical response, which is based on the spectral\nwinding number in the complex spectral plane, rather than the winding of\neigenstates in momentum space. Such quantized response is classical insofar as\nit applies to phenomenological non-Hermitian setting, arises from fundamental\nmathematical properties of the Green's function, and shows up in steady-state\nresponse, without invoking a conventional linear response theory.

In this paper, we demonstrate how data from videos of human running\n(e.g. taken from YouTube) can be used to shape the reward of the humanoid\nlearning agent to speed up the learning and produce a better result.\nSpecifically, we are using the positions of key body parts at regular time\nintervals to define a potential function for potential-based reward shaping\n(PBRS). Since PBRS does not change the optimal policy, this approach allows the\nRL agent to overcome sub-optimalities in the human movements that are shown in\nthe videos.\n  We present experiments in which we combine selected techniques from the top\nten approaches from the NIPS competition with further optimizations to create\nan high-performing agent as a baseline. We then demonstrate how video-based\nreward shaping improves the performance further, resulting in an RL agent that\nruns twice as fast as the baseline in 12 hours of training. We furthermore show\nthat our approach can overcome sub-optimal running behaviour in videos, with\nthe learned policy significantly outperforming that of the running agent from\nthe video.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2020 09:46:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-17"}

They have long been catalogued with corresponding mitigating\nsolutions called refactoring operations. Objective: This SLR has a twofold\ngoal: the first is to identify the main code smells detection techniques and\ntools discussed in the literature, and the second is to analyze to which extent\nvisual techniques have been applied to support the former. Method: Over 83\nprimary studies indexed in major scientific repositories were identified by our\nsearch string in this SLR. Then, following existing best practices for\nsecondary studies, we applied inclusion/exclusion criteria to select the most\nrelevant works, extract their features and classify them. Results: We found\nthat the most commonly used approaches to code smells detection are\nsearch-based (30.1%), and metric-based (24.1%). Most of the studies (83.1%) use\nopen-source software, with the Java language occupying the first position\n(77.1%). In terms of code smells, God Class (51.8%), Feature Envy (33.7%), and\nLong Method (26.5%) are the most covered ones. Machine learning techniques are\nused in 35% of the studies. Around 80% of the studies only detect code smells,\nwithout providing visualization techniques. In visualization-based approaches\nseveral methods are used, such as: city metaphors, 3D visualization techniques.\nConclusions: We confirm that the detection of CS is a non trivial task, and\nthere is still a lot of work to be done in terms of: reducing the subjectivity\nassociated with the definition and detection of CS; increasing the diversity of\ndetected CS and of supported programming languages; constructing and sharing\noracles and datasets to facilitate the replication of CS detection and\nvisualization techniques validation experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2020 10:32:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-07"}

The article contribution is mainly about stability\nconditions, all defined from strong mathematical background. We show how the\nstability of interpolation can be lost if certain geometrical requirements are\nnot satisfied by making a concrete elucidation of the local character of\nlinearization. To this effect, we draw special attention to the Grassmannian\nExponential map and optimal injectivity condition of this map, related to the\ncut--locus of Grassmann manifolds. From this, explicit stability conditions are\nestablished and can be directly used to determine the loss of injectivity in\npractical pMOR applications. Another stability condition is formulated when\nincreasing the number p of mode, deduced from principal angles of subspaces of\ndifferent dimensions p. This stability condition helps to explain the\nnon-monotonic oscillatory behavior of the error-norm with respect to the number\nof POD modes, and on the contrary, the monotonic decrease of the error-norm in\nthe two benchmark numerical examples considered herein. Under this study, pMOR\nis applied in hyperelastic structures using a non-intrusive approach for\ninserting the interpolated spatial POD ROM basis in a commercial FEM code. The\naccuracy is assessed by \\emph{a posteriori} error norms defined using the ROM\nFEM solution and its high fidelity counterpart simulation.

After the latent\nspace is disentangled, the style of a sentence can be transformed by tuning the\nstyle representation without affecting other features of the sentence. Previous\nworks usually use adversarial training to guarantee that disentangled vectors\ndo not affect each other. However, adversarial methods are difficult to train.\nEspecially when there are multiple features (e.g., sentiment, or tense, which\nwe call style types in this paper), each feature requires a separate\ndiscriminator for extracting a disentangled style vector corresponding to that\nfeature. In this paper, we propose a unified distribution-controlling method,\nwhich provides each specific style value (the value of style types, e.g.,\npositive sentiment, or past tense) with a unique representation. This method\ncontributes a solid theoretical basis to avoid adversarial training in\nmulti-type disentanglement. We also propose multiple loss functions to achieve\na style-content disentanglement as well as a disentanglement among multiple\nstyle types. In addition, we observe that if two different style types always\nhave some specific style values that occur together in the dataset, they will\naffect each other when transferring the style values. We call this phenomenon\ntraining bias, and we propose a loss function to alleviate such training bias\nwhile disentangling multiple types.

One form of explanation for\na prediction is an extractive rationale, i.e., a subset of features of an\ninstance that lead the model to give its prediction on the instance. Previous\nworks on generating extractive rationales usually employ a two-phase model: a\nselector that selects the most important features (i.e., the rationale)\nfollowed by a predictor that makes the prediction based exclusively on the\nselected features. One disadvantage of these works is that the main signal for\nlearning to select features comes from the comparison of the answers given by\nthe predictor and the ground-truth answers. In this work, we propose to squeeze\nmore information from the predictor via an information calibration method. More\nprecisely, we train two models jointly: one is a typical neural model that\nsolves the task at hand in an accurate but black-box manner, and the other is a\nselector-predictor model that additionally produces a rationale for its\nprediction. The first model is used as a guide to the second model.

We first study this problem\nin the category of log schemes: given a finite flat $R$-group scheme\n$\\mathcal{G}$, we prove that the data of a pointed $\\mathcal{G}$-log torsor\nover $\\mathcal{C}$ is equivalent to that of a morphism $\\mathcal{G}^D \\to\n\\mathrm{Pic}^{log}_{\\mathcal{C}/R}$, where $\\mathcal{G}^D$ is the Cartier dual\nof $\\mathcal{G}$ and $\\mathrm{Pic}^{log}_{\\mathcal{C}/R}$ the log Picard\nfunctor.

We\ncharacterize LDT graphs as a subclass of properly vertex-colored cographs, and\nprovide a polynomial-time recognition algorithm as well as an algorithm to\nconstruct a relaxed scenario that explains a given LDT. An edge in an LDT graph\nimplies that the two corresponding genes are separated by at least one HGT\nevent. The converse is not true, however. We show that the complete xenology\nrelation is described by an rs-Fitch graph, i.e., a complete multipartite graph\nsatisfying constraints on the vertex coloring.

In other words,\nboth approaches, i.e. GLM and LRM, apply to different domains, the observation\nand the label domains, and are linked by a normalization value at the\nleast-squares solution.

They\npotentially contribute to the diagnosis of solar atmospheric parameters through\ntheir high magnetic sensitivity. The goal of this study is to understand the\nradiation transfer process of these lines in detail and explore the ability of\nmagnetic field diagnosis in the infrared. We calculated the Stokes profiles and\nresponse functions of the two Mg I 12 $\\mu$m lines based on one-dimensional\nsolar atmospheric models using the Rybicki-Hummer (RH) radiative transfer code.\nThe integration of these profiles with respect to the wavelength was used to\ngenerate calibration curves related to the longitudinal and transverse fields.\nThe traditional single-wavelength calibration curve based on the weak-field\napproximation was also tested to determine if it is suitable for the infrared.\nThe 12.32 $\\mu$m line is more suitable for a magnetic field diagnosis because\nits relative emission intensity and polarization signal are stronger than that\nof the 12.22 $\\mu$m line. The result from the response functions illustrates\nthat the derived magnetic field and velocity with 12.32 $\\mu$m line mainly\noriginate from the height of 450 km, while that for the temperature is about\n490 km. The calibration curves obtained by the wavelength-integrated method\nshow a nonlinear distribution. For the Mg I 12.32 $\\mu$m line, the longitudinal\n(transverse) field can be effectively inferred from Stokes V/I (Q/I and U/I) in\nthe linear range below $\\sim 600$ G ($\\sim 3000$ G) in quiet regions and below\n$\\sim 400$ G ($\\sim 1200$ G) in penumbrae. Within the given linear range, the\nmethod is a supplement to the magnetic field calibration when the Zeeman\ncomponents are incompletely split.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2020 12:44:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-17"}

The existing clustering ensemble methods generally construct a\nco-association matrix, which indicates the pairwise similarity between samples,\nas the weighted linear combination of the connective matrices from different\nbase clusterings, and the resulting co-association matrix is then adopted as\nthe input of an off-the-shelf clustering algorithm, e.g., spectral clustering.\nHowever, the co-association matrix may be dominated by poor base clusterings,\nresulting in inferior performance. In this paper, we propose a novel low-rank\ntensor approximation-based method to solve the problem from a global\nperspective. Specifically, by inspecting whether two samples are clustered to\nan identical cluster under different base clusterings, we derive a\ncoherent-link matrix, which contains limited but highly reliable relationships\nbetween samples.

How to capture user interests and make accurate\nrecommendations for users in heterogeneous e-commerce scenarios is still a\ncontinuous research topic. However, most existing studies overlook the\nintrinsic association of the scenarios: the log data collected from platforms\ncan be naturally divided into different scenarios (e.g., country, city,\nculture).\n  We observed that the scenarios are heterogeneous because of the huge\ndifferences among them. Therefore, a unified model is difficult to effectively\ncapture complex correlations (e.g., differences and similarities) between\nmultiple scenarios thus seriously reducing the accuracy of recommendation\nresults.\n  In this paper, we target the problem of multi-scenario recommendation in\ne-commerce, and propose a novel recommendation model named Scenario-aware\nMutual Learning (SAML) that leverages the differences and similarities between\nmultiple scenarios.

In these measurements, the pressure\nof the gases with heavy molecular mass (SF$_6$) is set at 1 bar, while the\npressure of the lighter collision partner was varied. In view of the large\npolarizability of SF$_6$ and the very small polarizabilities of He, H$_2$ and\nD$_2$, under the chosen pressure conditions these low mass species act as\nspectators and do not contribute to the light scattering spectrum, while they\ninfluence the motion and relaxation of the heavy SF$_6$ molecules.

It is well known that from 1645 to 1715 solar activity was notably\nlow and the number of sunspots was extremely reduced. This epoch is known as\nthe Maunder Minimum (MM). The study of stars in prolonged activity minima like\nthe MM could help to shed light on this enigmatic epoch.\n  Aims. To explore if the star $\\zeta^{2}$ Ret, which belongs to a binary\nsystem, is in a state similar to the MM. We have collected more than 430\nspectra acquired between 2000 and 2019 with the HARPS, REOSC, UVES, and FEROS\nspectrographs.\n  Methods. We performed a detailed long-term activity study of both components\nusing the Mount Wilson index, which is obtained from the Ca II H\\&K lines. To\nsearch for signs of an activity cycle, we analyzed the resulting time-series\nwith the Generalized Lomb-Scargle and CLEAN periodograms.\n  Results. Our spectroscopic analysis shows a high activity level for zet01 Ret\nand a significant decrease in the magnetic activity cycle amplitude of\n$\\zeta^{2}$ Ret. Thus, the activity difference between both components has been\nslightly increased ($\\Delta$log (RHK) $\\sim$0.24 dex), when compared to the\npreviously reported value. The long series analyzed here allowed us to\nrecalculate and constrain the period of $\\zeta^{2}$ Ret to $\\sim$7.9 yr. We\nalso detected a long-term activity cycle of $\\sim$4.2 yr in $\\zeta^{1}$ Ret.\n  Conclusions. By analogy with the scenario that proposes a weak solar cycle\nduring the MM, we suggest that activity signatures showed by $\\zeta^{2}$ Ret,\ni.e., a very low activity level when compared to its stellar companion, a\nnotably decreasing amplitude ($\\sim$47%), and a cyclic behaviour, are possible\nevidence that this star could be in a MM state.

However, the majority of methods focus on designing network\narchitectures to better capture feature interactions while the feature\nembedding, especially for numerical features, has been overlooked. Existing\napproaches for numerical features are difficult to capture informative\nknowledge because of the low capacity or hard discretization based on the\noffline expertise feature engineering. In this paper, we propose a novel\nembedding learning framework for numerical features in CTR prediction (AutoDis)\nwith high model capacity, end-to-end training and unique representation\nproperties preserved. AutoDis consists of three core components:\nmeta-embeddings, automatic discretization and aggregation. Specifically, we\npropose meta-embeddings for each numerical field to learn global knowledge from\nthe perspective of field with a manageable number of parameters. Then the\ndifferentiable automatic discretization performs soft discretization and\ncaptures the correlations between the numerical features and meta-embeddings.\nFinally, distinctive and informative embeddings are learned via an aggregation\nfunction.

Most existing\nmethods are limited in transferring the prior knowledge from known intents to\nnew intents. They also have difficulties in providing high-quality supervised\nsignals to learn clustering-friendly features for grouping unlabeled intents.\nIn this work, we propose an effective method, Deep Aligned Clustering, to\ndiscover new intents with the aid of the limited known intent data. Firstly, we\nleverage a few labeled known intent samples as prior knowledge to pre-train the\nmodel. Then, we perform k-means to produce cluster assignments as\npseudo-labels. Moreover, we propose an alignment strategy to tackle the label\ninconsistency problem during clustering assignments. Finally, we learn the\nintent representations under the supervision of the aligned pseudo-labels. With\nan unknown number of new intents, we predict the number of intent categories by\neliminating low-confidence intent-wise clusters.

In a dataset with\nintents and example utterances from hundreds of professional chatbots, we saw\nimprovements of more than 10% in the equal error rate (EER) in almost a third\nof the chatbots when we apply those algorithms in comparison to a baseline of\nthe same algorithms without the meta-knowledge. The meta-knowledge proved to be\neven more relevant in detecting out-of-scope utterances, decreasing the false\nacceptance rate (FAR) in more than 20\\% in about half of the chatbots. The\nexperiments demonstrate that such symbolic meta-knowledge structures can be\neffectively mined and used by neuro-symbolic algorithms, apparently by\nincorporating into the learning process higher-level structures of the problem\nbeing solved. Based on these results, we also discuss how the use of mined\nmeta-knowledge can be an answer for the challenge of knowledge acquisition in\nneuro-symbolic algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2020 15:04:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-17"}

In polymers and\nmetal creep, it is customary to assume that the relaxed modulus is zero, so\nthat we have typically a crack speed which depends on some power of the stress\nintensity factor. Generally, when there is a finite relaxed modulus, it has\nbeen shown that the toughness increases between a value at very low speeds at a\nthreshold toughness G0, to a very fast fracture value at Ginf, and that the\nenhancement factor in infinite systems (where the classical singular fracture\nmechanics field dominates) simply corresponds to the ratio of instantaneous to\nrelaxed elastic moduli.\n  Here, we apply a cohesive model for the case of a bimaterial interface\nbetween an elastic and a viscoelastic material, assuming the crack remains at\nthe interface, and neglect the details of bimaterial singularity. For the case\nof a Maxwell material at low speeds the crack propagates with a speed which\ndepends only on viscosity, and the fourth power of the stress intensity factor,\nand not on the elastic moduli of either material. For the Schapery type of\npower law material with no relaxation modulus, there are more general results.\nFor arbitrary viscoelastic materials with nonzero relaxed modulus, we show that\nthe maximum toughness enhancement will be reduced with respect to that of a\nclassical viscoelastic crack in homogeneous material.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2020 15:14:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-17"}

However, most existing methods need to\naccess the training data of past 3D object classes when facing the common\nreal-world scenario: new classes of 3D objects arrive in a sequence. Moreover,\nthe performance of advanced approaches degrades dramatically for past learned\nclasses (i.e., catastrophic forgetting), due to the irregular and redundant\ngeometric structures of 3D point cloud data. To address these challenges, we\npropose a new Incremental 3D Object Learning (i.e., I3DOL) model, which is the\nfirst exploration to learn new classes of 3D object continually. Specifically,\nan adaptive-geometric centroid module is designed to construct discriminative\nlocal geometric structures, which can better characterize the irregular point\ncloud representation for 3D object.

Meanwhile, a score fairness\ncompensation strategy is proposed to further alleviate the catastrophic\nforgetting caused by unbalanced data between past and new classes of 3D object,\nby compensating biased prediction for new classes in the validation phase.\nExperiments on 3D representative datasets validate the superiority of our I3DOL\nframework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2020 15:17:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-17"}

We analysed the spectra of GRS 1915+105 in the soft\n$\\phi$ and hard $\\chi$ classes, using the high resolution spectroscopy offered\nby Chandra HETGS. In the soft state, we find a series of wind absorption lines\nthat follow a non linear dependence of velocity width, velocity shift and\nequivalent width with respect to ionisation, indicating a multiple component or\nstratified outflow. In the hard state we find only a faint Fe XXVI absorption\nline. We model the absorption lines in both the states using a dedicated MHD\nwind model to investigate a magnetic origin of the wind and to probe the cause\nof variability in the observed lines flux between the two states. The MHD disc\nwind model provides a good fit for both states, indicating the possibility of a\nmagnetic origin of the wind. The multiple ionisation components of the wind are\nwell characterised as a stratification of the same magnetic outflow. We find\nthat the observed variability in the lines flux between soft and hard states\ncannot be explained by photo-ionisation alone but it is most likely due to a\nlarge (three orders of magnitude) increase in the wind density. We find the\nmass outflow rate of the wind to be comparable to the accretion rate,\nsuggesting a intimate link between accretion and ejection processes that lead\nto state changes in BHBs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2020 15:37:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-24"}

Using the monthly number the FDA Center for Drug Evaluation and\nResearch (CDER) approvals from 1939 to 2019 as the data source, it is\ndemonstrated that the CHE has a distinct S-shaped structure demarcated by an\n8-year (1939-1947) Stagnation Period, a 27-year (1947-1974) Emergent\n(time-varying Period, and a 45-year (1974-2019) Saturation Period. Further,\ndominant periodicities (resolved via wavelet analyses) are identified during\nthe most recent 45-year CHE Saturation Period at 17, 8 and 4 years; thus, US\ndrug approvals have been following a Juglar-Kuznet mid-term cycle with\nKitchin-like bursts. As discussed, this work suggests that (1) changes in\nextrinsic factors (e.g., of economic and/or policy origin ) during the Emergent\nPeriod may have led to persistent growth in US drug approvals enjoyed since\n1974, (2) the CHE may be a valued method to explore influences on time series\ndata, and (3) innovation-related economic cycles exist (as viewed via the proxy\nmetric of US drug approvals).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2020 13:30:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 26 Dec 2020 02:19:01 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 1 Mar 2021 02:42:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-01"}

One technique consists in tweaking a clustering algorithm so that data\npoints sharing the same label tend to aggregate together.

It is suitable for revealing spatio-temporal features\nof both numerically and experimentally acquired data. Conceptually, DMD\nperforms a low-dimensional spectral decomposition of the data into the\nfollowing components: The modes, called DMD modes, encode the spatial\ncontribution of the decomposition, whereas the DMD amplitudes specify their\nimpact. Each associated eigenvalue, referred to as DMD eigenvalue,\ncharacterizes the frequency and growth rate of the DMD mode. In this paper, we\ndemonstrate how the components of DMD can be utilized to obtain temporal and\nspatial information from time-dependent flow fields. We begin with the\ntheoretical background of DMD and its application to unsteady flow. Next, we\nexamine the conventional process with DMD mathematically and put it in\nrelationship to the discrete Fourier transform. Our analysis shows that the\ncurrent use of DMD components has several drawbacks. To resolve these problems\nwe adjust the components and provide new and meaningful insights into the\ndecomposition: We show that our improved components describe the flow more\nadequately. Moreover, we remove redundancies in the decomposition and clarify\nthe interplay between components, allowing users to understand the impact of\ncomponents. These new representations ,which respect the spatio-temporal\ncharacter of DMD, enable two clustering methods that segment the flow into\nphysically relevant sections and can therefore be used for the selection of DMD\ncomponents. With a number of typical examples, we demonstrate that the\ncombination of these techniques allow new insights with DMD for unsteady flow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2020 08:42:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-18"}

Since manual\nlandmarking from 3D computed tomography (CT) images is a cumbersome task even\nfor the trained experts, automatic 3D landmark detection system is in a great\nneed. Recently, automatic landmarking of 2D cephalograms using deep learning\n(DL) has achieved great success, but 3D landmarking for more than 80 landmarks\nhas not yet reached a satisfactory level, because of the factors hindering\nmachine learning such as the high dimensionality of the input data and limited\namount of training data due to ethical restrictions on the use of medical data.\nThis paper presents a semi-supervised DL method for 3D landmarking that takes\nadvantage of anonymized landmark dataset with paired CT data being removed. The\nproposed method first detects a small number of easy-to-find reference\nlandmarks, then uses them to provide a rough estimation of the entire landmarks\nby utilizing the low dimensional representation learned by variational\nautoencoder (VAE). Anonymized landmark dataset is used for training the VAE.\nFinally, coarse-to-fine detection is applied to the small bounding box provided\nby rough estimation, using separate strategies suitable for mandible and\ncranium. For mandibular landmarks, patch-based 3D CNN is applied to the\nsegmented image of the mandible (separated from the maxilla), in order to\ncapture 3D morphological features of mandible associated with the landmarks. We\ndetect 6 landmarks around the condyle all at once, instead of one by one,\nbecause they are closely related to each other. For cranial landmarks, we again\nuse VAE-based latent representation for more accurate annotation. In our\nexperiment, the proposed method achieved an averaged 3D point-to-point error of\n2.91 mm for 90 landmarks only with 15 paired training data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2020 07:29:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-14"}

These have in common the\nselective optical excitation of molecules - fluorophores, or, in the case of\noptogenetics, light-gated ion channels - with laser radiation falling within\ntheir absorption spectrum. Unambiguous identification of molecules or cellular\nsubsets often requires jointly analyzing fluorescent signals from several\nfluorescent markers, so that MLEs are required to provide excitation\nwavelengths for several commercially available biocompatible fluorophores. A\nnumber of functionalities are required from MLEs in addition to sourcing the\nrequired wavelengths: Variable attenuation and/or digital intensity modulation\nin the Hz to kHz range are required for a number of applications such as\noptical trapping, lifetime imaging, or fluorescence recovery after\nphotobleaching (FRAP). Moreover, switching of the laser between two fiber\noutputs can be utilized for example to switch between scanning confocal\nmicroscopy and widefield illumination modes, for instance, for conventional\nfluorescence imaging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2020 19:08:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-15"}

The main bottleneck is self-attention which uses\nquadratic time and space with respect to the sequence length. In order to\nreduce the quadratic time complexity of the self-attention mechanism, Linformer\nby Facebook's AI research team was introduced where they showed that the\nself-attention mechanism can be approximated by a low-rank matrix and\nexploiting this finding, a new method for self-attention with linear time and\nspace complexity was proposed by them. In the Linformer, the time complexity\ndepends on the projection mapping dimension which acts as a hyperparameter and\naffects the performance of the model, tuning this hyperparameter can be\ntime-consuming. In this paper, I proposed an alternative method for\nself-attention with linear complexity in time and space and is independent of\nthe projection mapping dimension. Since this method works for long sequences\nthis can be used for images as well as audios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2020 13:23:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-26"}
