Specifically, we introduce\nthree controlled variables that form an orthogonal space and uniquely\ncharacterize a tetrahedron formation in 3D. This orthogonal space incorporates\nconstraints on the inter-agent distances and the signed volume of tetrahedron\nsubstructures. The formation is modeled using a directed graph with a\nleader-follower type configuration and single-integrator dynamics. We show that\nthe proposed decentralized formation controller ensures the \\textit{global}\nasymptotic stability and the local exponential stability of the desired\nformation for an \\textit{n}-agent system with no ambiguities. Unlike previous\nwork, this result is achieved without conditions on the tetrahedrons that form\nthe desired formation or on the control gains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Dec 2020 16:01:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 12 Dec 2020 06:51:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-15"}

With such a large total\nmass, GW190425 stands at five standard deviations away from the total mass\ndistribution of Galactic BNSs of $2.66\\pm 0.12$ M$_{\\odot}$.

The same goes\nfor structuralist alternatives, since, even if we accept that scientific\ntheories are committed to the existence of structures, but not objects, we\nstill do not know what structures are, metaphysically. Finally, we move forward\nin the discussion with the meta-Popperian method, which serves to reduce the\nmetaphysical alternatives associated with the ontological postulates of\nscientific theories.

Contamination with heavy metals such as copper can modulate such\necological interactions which in turn may impact ecosystem functioning.\nMotivated by this, we explored the effect of copper enrichment on such regime\nshifts in planktonic systems. We integrated copper contamination to a minimal\nphytoplankton-zooplankton model which is known to demonstrate abrupt\ntransitions between ecosystem states. Our results suggest that both the toxic\nand deficient concentration of copper in water bodies can lead to regime shift\nto an algal dominated alternative stable state. Further, interaction with fish\ndensity can also lead to collapse of population cycles thus leading to algal\ndomination in the intermediate copper ranges. Environmental stochasticity may\nresult in state transition much prior to the tipping point and there is a\nsignificant loss in the bimodality on increasing intensity and redness of\nnoise.

Moreover, we demonstrate that the\noutput-conditional distribution of hidden representations also allows\nquantifying aleatoric uncertainty via the entropy of the predictive\ndistribution. We analyse epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty inferred from the\nrepresentations of different layers and conclude that deeper layers lead to\nuncertainty with similar behaviour as established - but computationally more\nexpensive - methods (e.g. deep ensembles). While our approach does not require\nmodifying the training process, we follow prior work and experiment with an\nadditional regularising loss that increases the information in the latent\nrepresentations.

Therefore, a variety of compression\ntechniques (e.g. quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation) have been\nproposed to reduce the size and power consumption of DNNs. Blockwise knowledge\ndistillation is one of the compression techniques that can effectively reduce\nthe size of a highly complex DNN. However, it is not widely adopted due to its\nlong training time. In this paper, we propose a novel parallel blockwise\ndistillation algorithm to accelerate the distillation process of sophisticated\nDNNs.

This design choice goes directly against at least three key trends\nin computing that cause performance, scalability and energy bottlenecks: (1)\ndata access is a key bottleneck as many important applications are increasingly\ndata-intensive, and memory bandwidth and energy do not scale well, (2) energy\nconsumption is a key limiter in almost all computing platforms, especially\nserver and mobile systems, (3) data movement, especially off-chip to on-chip,\nis very expensive in terms of bandwidth, energy and latency, much more so than\ncomputation. These trends are especially severely-felt in the data-intensive\nserver and energy-constrained mobile systems of today. At the same time,\nconventional memory technology is facing many technology scaling challenges in\nterms of reliability, energy, and performance. As a result, memory system\narchitects are open to organizing memory in different ways and making it more\nintelligent, at the expense of higher cost. The emergence of 3D-stacked memory\nplus logic, the adoption of error correcting codes inside the latest DRAM\nchips, proliferation of different main memory standards and chips, specialized\nfor different purposes (e.g., graphics, low-power, high bandwidth, low\nlatency), and the necessity of designing new solutions to serious reliability\nand security issues, such as the RowHammer phenomenon, are an evidence of this\ntrend.

The spectral properties of the lineshape are determined by a long-term\naccumulation of phase-offsets, resulting in rapid high-amplitude intensity\nfluctuations in the time domain due to the narrow intra-cavity bandpass filter\nand the fast response time of the semiconductor optical amplifier gain medium.\nFurthermore, we present the distribution of the duration of dips in the\nintensity trace by running the laser in the regime in which dominantly dips\nform, and give insight into their evolution over a large number of roundtrips.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Dec 2020 20:45:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Apr 2021 11:37:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-20"}

Allowing for generality of the LGD theory we applied\nit to the group of binary oxides in this work. The calculations have been\nperformed in the assumption that oxygen vacancies, as elastic dipoles, can be\npartially transformed into electric dipoles due to the defect site-induced\nand/or surface-induced inversion symmetry breaking (via e.g. piezoelectric\neffect), and can \"migrate\" entire the depth of an ultra-thin film. We\ncalculated the dependence of the film polarization on the applied voltage for\nroom temperature and different film thickness. Since the many films of binary\noxide are ferroelectric and ferromagnetic due to the same oxygen vacancies,\nthey can be multiferroics. Performed calculations have shown that thin films of\nbinary oxides can be considered as a new wide class of multiferroics with broad\nspectra of physical properties useful for application in nanoelectronics and\nnanotechnology. The properties can be controlled by the choice of oxygen\nvacancies concentration, film thickness and special technological treatment,\nsuch as annealing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Dec 2020 22:44:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-08"}

Copulas are joint cumulative\ndistribution functions with uniform marginal distributions and are used to\ncapture interdependencies in isolation from marginals. Copulas are widely used\nwithin statistics, but have not gained traction in the context of modern deep\nlearning. In this paper, we introduce ACNet, a novel differentiable neural\nnetwork architecture that enforces structural properties and enables one to\nlearn an important class of copulas--Archimedean Copulas. Unlike Generative\nAdversarial Networks, Variational Autoencoders, or Normalizing Flow methods,\nwhich learn either densities or the generative process directly, ACNet learns a\ngenerator of the copula, which implicitly defines the cumulative distribution\nfunction of a joint distribution. We give a probabilistic interpretation of the\nnetwork parameters of ACNet and use this to derive a simple but efficient\nsampling algorithm for the learned copula. Our experiments show that ACNet is\nable to both approximate common Archimedean Copulas and generate new copulas\nwhich may provide better fits to data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Dec 2020 22:58:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-08"}

Vast evidence suggests that our eye movement\nconvey a wealth of information about the direction of our attention and mental\nstates and encode the information necessary to complete a task. Based on this\nevidence, we hypothesize that selective use of eye-gaze, as a clue for\nattention direction, will enhance the learning from demonstration. For this\npurpose, we propose a selective eye-gaze augmentation (SEA) network that learns\nwhen to use the eye-gaze information. The proposed network architecture\nconsists of three sub-networks: gaze prediction, gating, and action prediction\nnetwork. Using the prior 4 game frames, a gaze map is predicted by the gaze\nprediction network which is used for augmenting the input frame. The gating\nnetwork will determine whether the predicted gaze map should be used in\nlearning and is fed to the final network to predict the action at the current\nframe. To validate this approach, we use publicly available Atari Human\nEye-Tracking And Demonstration (Atari-HEAD) dataset consists of 20 Atari games\nwith 28 million human demonstrations and 328 million eye-gazes (over game\nframes) collected from four subjects. We demonstrate the efficacy of selective\neye-gaze augmentation in comparison with state of the art Attention Guided\nImitation Learning (AGIL), Behavior Cloning (BC). The results indicate that the\nselective augmentation approach (the SEA network) performs significantly better\nthan the AGIL and BC. Moreover, to demonstrate the significance of selective\nuse of gaze through the gating network, we compare our approach with the random\nselection of the gaze. Even in this case, the SEA network performs\nsignificantly better validating the advantage of selectively using the gaze in\ndemonstration learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 5 Dec 2020 23:35:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-08"}

Each resource is independently controlled, and its\nresponse drives the local bus voltage angle toward a trajectory that tracks the\nangle of the center of inertia. The center-of-inertia angle is estimated in\nreal time from wide-area measurements. The main objectives are to stabilize\ntransient disturbances and increase the amount of power that can be safely\ntransferred over key transmission paths without loss of synchronism. Here we\nenvision the actuators as utility-scale energy storage systems; however,\nequivalent examples could be developed for partially-curtailed photovoltaic\ngeneration and/or Type 4 wind turbine generators. The strategy stems from a\ntime-varying linearization of the equations of motion for a synchronous\nmachine. The control action produces synchronizing torque in a special\nreference frame that accounts for the motion of the center of inertia. This\ndrives the system states toward the desired trajectory and promotes rotor angle\nstability. For testing we employ a reduced-order dynamic model of the North\nAmerican Western Interconnection.

We first derive the exact closed-form of coverage probability\nfor the unit element. Afterward, with the method of moment matching, the\napproximation of the coverage probability can be formulated as the ratio of\nupper incomplete Gamma function and Gamma function, allowing an arbitrary\nnumber of elements. Finally, we comprehensively evaluate the impacts of\nessential factors on the coverage probability, such as the coefficient of\nfading channel, the number and size of the element, and the angle of incidence.\nOverall, the paper provides a succinct and general expression of coverage\nprobability, which can be helpful in the performance evaluation and practical\nimplementation of the IRS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Dec 2020 03:31:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-19"}

However, large-scale\nprocess deployment is currently limited by unfavourable process economics\nresulting from significant up- and down-stream costs for obtaining pure CO2,\nseparation of reaction products and increased logistical effort. We have\ndiscovered a method for economically viable recycling of waste CO2 that\naddresses these challenges. Our approach is based on integration of a CO2R unit\ninto an existing manufacturing process: ethylene oxide (EO) production, which\nemits CO2 as a by-product. The standard EO process separates waste CO2 from gas\nstream, hence the substrate for electroreduction is available at an EO plant at\nno additional cost. CO2 can be converted into an ethylene-rich stream and\nrecycled on-site back to the EO reactor, which uses ethylene as a raw material,\nand also the anode product (oxygen) can be simultaneously valorized for the EO\nproduction reaction. If powered by a renewable electricity source, the process\nwill significantly (ca. 80%) reduce the CO2 emissions of an EO manufacturing\nplant. A sensitivity analysis shows that the recycling approach can be\neconomically viable in the short term and that its payback time could be as low\nas 1-2 years in the regions with higher carbon taxes and/or with access to\nlow-cost electricity sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Dec 2020 07:26:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-17"}

We have indicated that the PBH merger rate within each\nhalo for the ellipsoidal models is more significant than for the spherical\nmodels. We have specified that the PBH merger rate per unit time and per unit\nvolume for the ellipsoidal-collapse halo models is about one order of magnitude\nhigher than the corresponding spherical models.

Finally, we\nhave presented a constraint on the PBH abundance within the context of\nellipsoidal and spherical models. By comparing the results with the aLIGO\nmergers during the third observing run (O3), we have shown that the merger rate\nin the ellipsoidal-collapse halo models falls within the aLIGO window, while\nthe same result is not valid for the spherical-collapse ones. Furthermore, we\nhave compared the total merger rate of PBHs in terms of their fraction in the\nellipsoidal-collapse halo models for several masses of PBHs. The results\nsuggest that the total merger rate of PBHs changes inversely with their masses.\nWe have also estimated the relation between the fraction of PBHs and their\nmasses in the ellipsoidal-collapse halo model and have shown it for a narrow\nmass distribution of PBHs.

The\nmeasurements are used to inform the understanding of underlying mechanisms of\nobserved flow dynamics as they are related to shock wave induced instabilities.\nThe differences in cavity topology and behaviour at different cavitation\nnumbers are examined to highlight flow features such as the pair of cavitating\nspanwise vortices in the shear layer and propagating bubbly shock front. The\nshock speeds at different cavitation conditions are estimated based on\nvoid-fraction measurements using the X-T diagram and compared to those computed\nusing the one-dimensional Rankine Hugoniot jump condition. The two\nspeeds(computed and measured) are found to be comparable. The effect of\ncompressibility of the bubbly mixture is determined by estimating the local\nspeed of sound using homogeneous `frozen model' and homogeneous `equilibrium\nmodel'. The current estimation of sound speed suggests that expression used to\ndetermine the local speed of sound is closer to the classic `frozen model' than\nthe `equilibrium model' of speed of sound.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Dec 2020 09:10:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-08"}

This is due to the low contrast between the tumor and\nadjacent tissues, the anatomical variation of the esophagus, as well as the\noccasional presence of foreign bodies (e.g. feeding tubes). Physicians\ntherefore usually exploit additional knowledge such as endoscopic findings,\nclinical history, additional imaging modalities like PET scans. Achieving his\nadditional information is time-consuming, while the results are error-prone and\nmight lead to non-deterministic results. In this paper we aim to investigate if\nand to what extent a simplified clinical workflow based on CT alone, allows one\nto automatically segment the esophageal tumor with sufficient quality. For this\npurpose, we present a fully automatic end-to-end esophageal tumor segmentation\nmethod based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The proposed network,\ncalled Dilated Dense Attention Unet (DDAUnet), leverages spatial and channel\nattention gates in each dense block to selectively concentrate on determinant\nfeature maps and regions. Dilated convolutional layers are used to manage GPU\nmemory and increase the network receptive field.

While governments and healthcare\nagencies are eager to mandate the deployment of such applications en-masse,\nthey face increasing scrutiny from the popular press, security companies, and\nhuman rights watch agencies that fear the exploitation of these technologies as\nsurveillance tools. Finding the optimal balance between community safety and\nprivacy has been a challenge, and strategies to address these concerns have\nvaried among countries. This paper describes two important attacks that affect\na broad swath of contact-tracing applications. The first, referred to as\ncontact-isolation attack, is a user-privacy attack that can be used to identify\npotentially infected patients in your neighborhood. The second is a\ncontact-pollution attack that affects the integrity of contact tracing\napplications by causing them to produce a high volume of false-positive alerts.\nWe developed prototype implementations and evaluated both attacks in the\ncontext of the DP-3T application framework, but these vulnerabilities affect a\nmuch broader class of applications. We found that both attacks are feasible and\nrealizable with a minimal attacker work factor. We further conducted an impact\nassessment of these attacks by using a simulation study and measurements from\nthe SafeGraph database.

While large-scale\nquarantine has been the most successful short-term policy, it is unsustainable\nover long periods as it exerts enormous costs on societies. As a result,\ngovernments which have been able to partially control the spread of the disease\nhave been deciding to reopen businesses. However, the WHO has warned about the\nrisks of re-opening prematurely, as is playing out in some countries such as\nSpain, France and various states in the US such as California, Florida,\nArizona, and Texas. Thus, it is urgent to consider a flexible policy that\nlimits transmission without requiring large scale and damaging quarantines.\nHere, we have designed a multi-level quarantine process based on the mobility\npatterns of individuals and the severity of COVID-19 contagion in the US. By\nidentifying the natural boundaries of social mobility, policymakers can impose\ntravel restrictions that are minimally disruptive to social and economic\nactivity. The dynamics of social fragmentation during the COVID-19 outbreak are\nanalyzed by applying the Louvain method with modularity optimization to weekly\nmobility networks. In a multi-scale community detection process, using the\nlocations of confirmed cases, natural break points as well as high risk areas\nfor contagion are identified. At the smaller scales, for communities with a\nhigher number of confirmed cases, contact tracing and associated quarantine\npolicies is increasingly important and can be informed by the community\nstructure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Dec 2020 15:22:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-08"}

The evaluation of the spectrum in the interaction zone\nindicates that the broadband low-frequency unsteadiness is predominantly\ntwo-dimensional, and can be isolated via spanwise averaging.

In this paper, we present an alternative\nderivation of CD that does not require any approximation and sheds new light on\nthe objective that is actually being optimized by the algorithm. Specifically,\nwe show that CD is an adversarial learning procedure, where a discriminator\nattempts to classify whether a Markov chain generated from the model has been\ntime-reversed. Thus, although predating generative adversarial networks (GANs)\nby more than a decade, CD is, in fact, closely related to these techniques. Our\nderivation settles well with previous observations, which have concluded that\nCD's update steps cannot be expressed as the gradients of any fixed objective\nfunction. In addition, as a byproduct, our derivation reveals a simple\ncorrection that can be used as an alternative to Metropolis-Hastings rejection,\nwhich is required when the underlying Markov chain is inexact (e.g. when using\nLangevin dynamics with a large step).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Dec 2020 15:54:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2020 12:17:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 15 Mar 2021 20:03:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-17"}

For an integer\n$k\\in\\mathbb{N}$, the $k$-disc of a vertex $v\\in V$ is defined as the rooted\nsubgraph of $G$ that is induced by all vertices whose distance to $v$ is at\nmost $k$. The $k$-disc frequency distribution vector of $G$, denoted by\n$\\text{freq}_{k}(G)$, is a vector indexed by all isomorphism types of rooted\n$k$-discs. For each such isomorphism type $\\Gamma$, the corresponding entry in\n$\\text{freq}_{k}(G)$ counts the fraction of vertices in $V$ that have a\n$k$-disc isomorphic to $\\Gamma$.

By precisely engineering the configuration with\natomically thin materials, the phase singularity has been successfully achieved\nwith a significantly enhanced lateral position shift effect. Based on our\nknowledge, it is the first experimental demonstration of a lateral position\nsignal change > 340 {\\mu}m at a sensing interface from all optical techniques.\nWith this enhanced plasmonic effect, the detection limit has been\nexperimentally demonstrated to be 10-15 mol L-1 for TNF-{\\alpha} cancer marker,\nwhich has been found in various human diseases including inflammatory diseases\nand different kinds of cancer. The as-reported novel integration of atomically\nthin Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST) with plasmonic substrate, which results in a phase\nsingularity and thus a giant lateral position shift, enables the detection of\ncancer markers with low molecular weight at femtomolar level. These results\nwill definitely hold promising potential in biomedical application and clinical\ndiagnostics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Dec 2020 10:15:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Jan 2021 15:55:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 25 Jan 2021 03:17:51 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 2021 15:52:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-24"}

Recently, unsupervised learning based\nconvolutional neural networks (CNN) have been utilized for different types of\nimage fusion tasks such as medical image fusion, infrared-visible image fusion\nfor autonomous driving as well as multi-focus and multi-exposure image fusion\nfor satellite imagery. However, it is challenging to analyze the reliability of\nthese CNNs for the image fusion tasks since no groundtruth is available. This\nled to the use of a wide variety of model architectures and optimization\nfunctions yielding quite different fusion results. Additionally, due to the\nhighly opaque nature of such neural networks, it is difficult to explain the\ninternal mechanics behind its fusion results. To overcome these challenges, we\npresent a novel real-time visualization tool, named FuseVis, with which the\nend-user can compute per-pixel saliency maps that examine the influence of the\ninput image pixels on each pixel of the fused image. We trained several image\nfusion based CNNs on medical image pairs and then using our FuseVis tool, we\nperformed case studies on a specific clinical application by interpreting the\nsaliency maps from each of the fusion methods. We specifically visualized the\nrelative influence of each input image on the predictions of the fused image\nand showed that some of the evaluated image fusion methods are better suited\nfor the specific clinical application. To the best of our knowledge, currently,\nthere is no approach for visual analysis of neural networks for image fusion.\nTherefore, this work opens up a new research direction to improve the\ninterpretability of deep fusion networks. The FuseVis tool can also be adapted\nin other deep neural network based image processing applications to make them\ninterpretable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Dec 2020 10:03:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-17"}

Therefore, it is surprising to find that, within our current\nunderstanding, the photovoltaic effect has so far eluded the first and second\nlaws of thermodynamics. The inconsistency emerges from the fact that\nphotovoltaics obey a distinct law of detailed balance1. Since radiative\nprocesses depend on only two independent variables that are the chemical\npotential and the temperature, the detailed balance, and the two laws of\nthermodynamics cannot be mutually solved. In this work, we resolve this\nincompatibility by proposing that the system is controlled by yet a third\nindependent variable, which is related to the emissivity. This unification not\nonly advances our fundamental understanding of light-matter interactions but,\nperhaps more importantly, allows us to assess the limiting factors of advanced\nphotovoltaic concepts designed for elevated temperatures. These include\nthermophotovoltaics2, thermoradiative and thermophotonic solar power\nconversion, and radiative cooling, which are instrumental in our ability to\ndevelop advanced renewable energy technologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 6 Dec 2020 11:02:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-22"}
