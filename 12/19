This is in contrast to\njoint analyses with the complete CMB data. Our simple implementation of\ncontrasting the effect of different CMB priors on the $H_0$ estimate shows that\nthe early universe information from the CMB data when decoupled from late-times\nphysics could be in agreement with a higher value of $H_0$. {We also find no\nevidence for the early dark energy model using only the early universe physics\nwithin the CMB data.

In this paper we consider a variant of the general\nposition problem called the \\emph{monophonic position problem}, obtained by\nreplacing `shortest path' by `induced path'. We prove some basic properties and\nbounds for the monophonic position number of a graph and determine the\nmonophonic position number of some graph families, including unicyclic graphs,\ncomplements of bipartite graphs and split graphs. We show that the monophonic\nposition number of triangle-free graphs is bounded above by the independence\nnumber. We present realisation results for the general position number,\nmonophonic position number and monophonic hull number. Finally we discuss the\ncomplexity of the monophonic position problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2020 16:20:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 9 Jan 2021 14:22:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 18 Apr 2022 17:53:36 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 14 Dec 2022 16:12:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-15"}

The\nmicroscopes are now fully automated and next expected to be smart, to make\nacquisition decisions based on the images. It calls for analysing them on the\nfly. Biology further imposes training on a reduced dataset due to cost and time\nto prepare the samples and have the datasets annotated by experts. We propose\nhere a real-time image processing, compliant with these specifications by\nbalancing accurate detection and execution performance. We characterised the\nimages using a generic, high-dimensional feature extractor. We then classified\nthe images using machine learning for the sake of understanding the\ncontribution of each feature in decision and execution time. We found that the\nnon-linear-classifier random forests outperformed Fisher's linear discriminant.\nMore importantly, the most discriminant and time-consuming features could be\nexcluded without any significant loss in accuracy, offering a substantial gain\nin execution time. It suggests a feature-group redundancy likely related to the\nbiology of the observed cells. We offer a method to select fast and\ndiscriminant features. In our assay, a 79.6 $\\pm$ 2.4 % accurate classification\nof a cell took 68.7 $\\pm$ 3.5 ms (mean $\\pm$ SD, 5-fold cross-validation nested\nin 10 bootstrap repeats), corresponding to 14 cells per second, dispatched into\n8 phases of the cell cycle using 12 feature-groups and operating a consumer\nmarket ARM-based embedded system. Interestingly, a simple neural network\noffered similar performances paving the way to faster training and\nclassification, using parallel execution on a general-purpose graphic\nprocessing unit. Finally, this strategy is also usable for deep neural networks\npaving the way to optimising these algorithms for smart microscopy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2020 16:20:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-18"}

We find that the junction\nconditions of such non-local theories are much more restrictive than in local\ntheories, since the conditions comprise an infinite number of equations for the\nRicci scalar. These conditions can constrain the geometry far beyond the\nmatching hypersurface. Furthermore, we derive the junction field equations\nwhich are satisfied by the energy-momentum on the hypersurface. It turns out\nthat the theory still allows some matter content on the hypersurface (without\nexternal flux and external tension), but with a traceless energy-momentum\ntensor. We also discuss the proper matching condition where no matter is\nconcentrated on the hypersurface. Finally, we explore the possible applications\nand consequences of our results to the braneworld scenarios and star models.\nParticularly, we find that the internal tension is given purely by the trace of\nthe energy-momentum tensor of the matter confined to the brane. Consequences of\nthe junction conditions are illustrated on two simple examples of static and\ncollapsing stars. It is demonstrated that even without solving the field\nequations the geometry on one side of the hypersurface can be determined to a\ngreat extent by the geometry on the other side if the Ricci scalar is analytic.\nWe further show that some usual star models in the general relativity are no\nlonger solutions of the infinite derivative gravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2020 16:48:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-07"}

These are feed-forward neural networks in which each edge is given a\nrandom $\\{0,1\\}$-valued filter, that have two modes of operation: in the first\neach edge output is multiplied by its random filter, resulting in a random\noutput, while in the second each edge output is multiplied by the expectation\nof its filter, leading to a deterministic output. It is common to use the\nrandom mode during training and the deterministic mode during testing and\nprediction.\n  Both theorems are of the following form: Given a function to approximate and\na threshold $\\varepsilon>0$, there exists a dropout network that is\n$\\varepsilon$-close in probability and in $L^q$. The first theorem applies to\ndropout networks in the random mode. It assumes little on the activation\nfunction, applies to a wide class of networks, and can even be applied to\napproximation schemes other than neural networks. The core is an algebraic\nproperty that shows that deterministic networks can be exactly matched in\nexpectation by random networks. The second theorem makes stronger assumptions\nand gives a stronger result. Given a function to approximate, it provides\nexistence of a network that approximates in both modes simultaneously. Proof\ncomponents are a recursive replacement of edges by independent copies, and a\nspecial first-layer replacement that couples the resulting larger network to\nthe input.\n  The functions to be approximated are assumed to be elements of general normed\nspaces, and the approximations are measured in the corresponding norms. The\nnetworks are constructed explicitly. Because of the different methods of proof,\nthe two results give independent insight into the approximation properties of\nrandom dropout networks. With this, we establish that dropout neural networks\nbroadly satisfy a universal-approximation property.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2020 16:53:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-21"}

Near-critical loci and structural crossovers can\nadditionally be identified in analogy with simple fluids. Motivated by the\nstriking similarity to the behaviour of equilibrium fluids with short-ranged\npair-wise attractions, we show that a direct mapping to pair potentials in the\ndilute limit implies interactions that are insufficiently attractive to\nengender phase separation. Instead, this is driven by the emergence of\nmulti-body effects associated with particle caging that occurs at sufficiently\nhigh number density. We quantify these effects via information-theoretical\nmeasures of $n$-body effective interactions extracted from the configurational\nstructure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2020 17:08:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-27"}

Existing 3d reconstruction methods do not focus on body regions in\nself-contact and consequently recover configurations that are either far from\neach other or self-intersecting, when they should just touch. This leads to\nperceptually incorrect estimates and limits impact in those very fine-grained\nanalysis domains where detailed 3d models are expected to play an important\nrole. To address such challenges we detect self-contact and design 3d losses to\nexplicitly enforce it. Specifically, we develop a model for Self-Contact\nPrediction (SCP), that estimates the body surface signature of self-contact,\nleveraging the localization of self-contact in the image, during both training\nand inference. We collect two large datasets to support learning and\nevaluation: (1) HumanSC3D, an accurate 3d motion capture repository containing\n$1,032$ sequences with $5,058$ contact events and $1,246,487$ ground truth 3d\nposes synchronized with images collected from multiple views, and (2)\nFlickrSC3D, a repository of $3,969$ images, containing $25,297$\nsurface-to-surface correspondences with annotated image spatial support.

While real-world\ndeployment involves both resource allocation and subsequent coordinated\npatrolling with communication and real-time, uncertain information, previous\ngame models do not fully address both of these stages simultaneously.\nFurthermore, adopting existing solution strategies is difficult since they do\nnot scale well for larger, more complex variants of the game models.\n  We therefore first propose a novel GSG model that combines defender\nallocation, patrolling, real-time drone notification to human patrollers, and\ndrones sending warning signals to attackers. The model further incorporates\nuncertainty for real-time decision-making within a team of drones and human\npatrollers. Second, we present CombSGPO, a novel and scalable algorithm based\non reinforcement learning, to compute a defender strategy for this game model.\nCombSGPO performs policy search over a multi-dimensional, discrete action space\nto compute an allocation strategy that is best suited to a best-response\npatrolling strategy for the defender, learnt by training a multi-agent Deep\nQ-Network. We show via experiments that CombSGPO converges to better strategies\nand is more scalable than comparable approaches. Third, we provide a detailed\nanalysis of the coordination and signaling behavior learnt by CombSGPO, showing\ngroup formation between defender resources and patrolling formations based on\nsignaling and notifications between resources. Importantly, we find that\nstrategic signaling emerges in the final learnt strategy. Finally, we perform\nexperiments to evaluate these strategies under different levels of uncertainty.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2020 17:53:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-09"}

For\nimage classification, we show that separation of class means can be achieved\nwith rectified wavelet tight frames that are not learned. It defines a\nscattering transform. Learning $1 \\times 1$ convolutional tight frames along\nscattering channels and applying a soft-thresholding reduces within-class\nvariabilities. The resulting scattering network reaches the classification\naccuracy of ResNet-18 on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, with fewer layers and no\nlearned biases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2020 18:27:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Mar 2021 15:06:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-16"}

An important challenge\nin the design of novel materials which utilize such properties is to precisely\nconnect the static structure of active systems to the dissipation of energy\ninduced by the local driving. Here, we use tools from liquid-state theories and\nmachine learning to take on this challenge. We first demonstrate analytically\nfor an isotropic active matter system that dissipation and pair correlations\nare closely related when driving forces behave like an active temperature. We\nthen extend a nonequilibrium mean-field framework for predicting these pair\ncorrelations, which unlike most existing approaches is applicable even for\nstrongly interacting particles and far from equilibrium, to predicting\ndissipation in these systems. Based on this theory, we reveal a robust analytic\nrelation between dissipation and structure which holds even as the system\napproaches a nonequilibrium phase transition. Finally, we construct a neural\nnetwork which maps static configurations of particles to their dissipation rate\nwithout any prior knowledge of the underlying dynamics.

This naturally raises the\nquestion of whether disclosing secrets is fundamentally necessary for\nidentifying oneself, or more generally for proving a statement to be correct.\nDevelopments in computer science provide an elegant solution via the concept of\nzero-knowledge proofs: a prover can convince a verifier of the validity of a\ncertain statement without facilitating the elaboration of a proof at all.

Security is enforced\nvia the physical principle of special relativity, and no computational\nassumption (such as the existence of one-way functions) is required. Our\nimplementation exclusively relies on off-the-shelf equipment and works at both\nshort (60 m) and long distances ($\\geqslant$400 m) in about one second. This\ndemonstrates the practical potential of multi-prover zero-knowledge protocols,\npromising for identification tasks and blockchain applications such as\ncryptocurrencies or smart contracts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2020 19:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Feb 2022 08:10:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-17"}

The existing resource allocation schemes only consider CPU as\nthe requested resource and assume utility for MESs as either a random variable\nor dependent on the requested CPU only. This paper presents a novel\ncomprehensive utility function for resource allocation in MEC. The utility\nfunction considers the heterogeneous nature of applications that a UE offloads\nto MES. The proposed utility function considers all important parameters,\nincluding CPU, RAM, hard disk space, required time, and distance, to calculate\na more realistic utility value for MESs. Moreover, we improve upon some general\nalgorithms, used for resource allocation in MEC and cloud computing, by\nconsidering our proposed utility function. We name the improved versions of\nthese resource allocation schemes as comprehensive resource allocation schemes.\nThe UE requests are modeled to represent the amount of resources requested by\nthe UE as well as the time for which the UE has requested these resources. The\nutility function depends upon the UE requests and the distance between UEs and\nMES, and serves as a realistic means of comparison between different types of\nUE requests. Choosing (or selecting) an optimal MES with the optimal amount of\nresources to be allocated to each UE request is a challenging task. We show\nthat MES resource allocation is sub-optimal if CPU is the only resource\nconsidered. By taking into account the other resources, i.e., RAM, disk space,\nrequest time, and distance in the utility function, we demonstrate improvement\nin the resource allocation algorithms in terms of service rate, utility, and\nMES energy consumption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2020 19:08:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-22"}

We quantify the complexity of\nthese ground states, and their response to the attacks, by calculating\ndistributions of network measures of an emergent network whose link weights are\nthe pairwise mutual information between spins. We focus on attacks which\nprojectively measure spins. We find that the emergent networks in the ground\nstate do not satisfy the usual criteria for complexity, and their average\nproperties are captured well by a single dimensionless parameter in the\nHamiltonian. While the response of classical networks to attacks is\nwell-studied, where classical complex networks are known to be more robust to\nrandom attacks than random networks, we find counterintuitive results for our\nquantum networks.

Evolutionary\nprogramming is used to simulate processes in the natural immune system: B-cell\nflocking, clonal expansion, and affinity maturation. We show that the RAILS\nlearning curve exhibits similar diversity-selection learning phases as observed\nin our in vitro biological experiments.

The\nsecond group includes the self-consistent modelling of spectral radiative\ntransfer and two-dimensional spatial structure of the column, with both thermal\nand bulk Comptonization taken into account. The changes in the structure of the\ncolumn and the shape of X-ray continuum are investigated depending on physical\nparameters of the model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2020 20:24:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-22"}

This work explores how the physical device geometry\naffects the sensitivity of exchange to fluctuations in applied gate voltage and\ninterdot bias due to charge noise. We present a modified linear combination of\nharmonic orbitals configuration interaction (LCHO-CI) method for calculating\nexchange energies that is applicable to general quantum dot networks. In the\nmodified LCHO-CI approach, an orthogonal set of harmonic orbitals formed at the\ncenter of the dot network is used to approximate the many-electron states. This\nchoice of basis significantly reduces the computation time of the full CI\ncalculation by enabling a pre-calculated library of matrix elements to be used\nin evaluating the Coulomb integrals. The resultant many-electron spectra are\nmapped onto a Heisenberg Hamiltonian to determine the individual pairwise\nelectronic exchange interaction strengths, $J_{ij}$. The accuracy of the\nmodified LCHO-CI method is further improved by optimizing the choice of\nharmonic orbitals without significantly lengthening the calculation time. The\nmodified LCHO-CI method is used to calculate $J$ for a silicon MOSFET double\nquantum dot occupied by two electrons. Two-dimensional potential landscapes are\ncalculated from a 3D device structure, including both the Si/SiO$_2$\nheterostructure and metal gate electrodes. The computational efficiency of the\nmodified LCHO-CI method enables systematic tuning of the device parameters to\ndetermine their impact on the sensitivity of $J$ to charge noise, including\nplunger gate size, tunnel gate width, SiO$_2$ thickness and dot eccentricity.\nGenerally, we find that geometries with larger dot charging energies, smaller\nplunger gate lever arms, and symmetric dots are less sensitive to noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2020 21:06:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-22"}

In this study, we report on maghemite\nnanoparticles functionalized with citrate, dextran and polyethylene glycol\ncoatings and their interaction with the clotting protein fibrinogen. Further,\nwe investigate using biophysical tools (e.g. dynamic light scattering, circular\ndichroism spectroscopy and quartz crystal microbalance) the interaction of the\nmagnetic nanoparticles-fibrinogen bioconjugates with artificial cell membranes\nas a model system for blood platelets. We found that fibrinogen corona\nformation provides colloidal stability to maghemite nanoparticles. In addition,\nbioconjugates of fibrinogen with dextran and citrate coated NPs interact with\nintegrin containing lipid bilayer, especially upon treatment with divalent\nions, whereas PEG-coating reveals minor interaction. Our study at the interface\nof protein-conjugated nanoparticles and artificial cell membranes is essential\nfor engineering safe nanoparticles for drug delivery applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2020 21:30:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-22"}

In response to intracellular signals and ligand binding,\nintegrins adopt different conformations: the bent (resting) form; the\nintermediate extended form; and the ligand-occupied active form. An integrin\nundergoing such conformational dynamics is the heterodimeric platelet receptor\nalphaIIbbeta3. Although the dramatic rearrangement of the overall structure of\nalphaIIbbeta3 during the activation process is potentially related to changes\nin the protein secondary structure, this has not been investigated so far in a\nmembrane environment. Here we examine the Mn2+- and drug-induced activation of\nalphaIIbbeta3 and the impact on the structure of this protein reconstituted\ninto liposomes.

The PA\nsetup refers to a system with two (sets of) antennas on top of a vehicle, where\nthe PA(s) positioned in front of the vehicle is(are) utilized to predict the\nchannel state information required for data transmission to the receive\nantennas (RAs) aligned behind the PA.

Moreover, summarizing the field trials for\nPAs and the 3GPP attempts on (moving) relays, we compare the performance of\ndifferent PA and non-PA methods for vehicle communications in both urban and\nrural areas with the PA setup backhauled through terrestrial or satellite\ntechnology, respectively.

Spatially resolving these light curves is important for\nassessing time-varying surface features and the existence of an atmosphere,\nwhich in turn is critical to life on Earth and significant for determining\nhabitability on exoplanets. Given that Earth is the only celestial body\nconfirmed to harbor life, treating it as a proxy exoplanet by analyzing\ntime-resolved spectral images provides a benchmark in the search for habitable\nexoplanets. The Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) on the Deep Space\nClimate Observatory (DSCOVR) provides such an opportunity, with observations of\n~5000 full-disk sunlit Earth images each year at ten wavelengths with high\ntemporal frequency. We disk-integrate these spectral images to create\nsingle-point light curves and decompose them into principal components (PCs).\nUsing machine learning techniques to relate the PCs to six preselected spatial\nfeatures, we find that the first and fourth PCs of the single-point light\ncurves, contributing ~83.23% of the light curve variability, contain\ninformation about low and high clouds, respectively. Surface information\nrelevant to the contrast between land and ocean reflectance is contained in the\nsecond PC, while individual land sub-types are not easily distinguishable\n(<0.1% total light curve variation). We build an Earth model by systematically\naltering the spatial features to derive causal relationships to the PCs. This\nmodel can serve as a baseline for analyzing Earth-like exoplanets and guide\nwavelength selection and sampling strategies for future observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Dec 2020 00:28:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-24"}

Estimating tissue displacement in all directions is\nrequired to accurately estimate the mechanical properties. Despite capabilities\nof elastography techniques in estimating displacement in both axial and lateral\ndirections, estimation of axial displacement is more accurate than lateral\ndirection due to higher sampling frequency, higher resolution and having a\ncarrier signal propagating in the axial direction. Among different ultrasound\nimaging techniques, Synthetic Aperture (SA) has better lateral resolution than\nothers, but it is not commonly used for ultrasound elastography due to its\nlimitation in imaging depth of field. Virtual source synthetic aperture (VSSA)\nimaging is a technique to implement synthetic aperture beamforming on the\nfocused transmitted data to overcome limitation of SA in depth of field while\nmaintaining the same lateral resolution as SA. Besides lateral resolution, VSSA\nhas the capability of increasing sampling frequency in the lateral direction\nwithout interpolation. In this paper, we utilize VSSA to perform beamforming to\nenable higher resolution and sampling frequency in the lateral direction.

We hereby propose a y-shaped multi-input deep convolutional\nnetwork, yNet, which can effectively account for combined effects of multiple\nmixed inputs on output field. The proposed yNet is applied to the simulation of\nporosity evolution in selective lasering sintering (SLS). Upon testing, yNet\ncan simulate nearly identical porosity evolution and development to the\nphysics-based model, with a 99.13% morphological similarity for various SLS\nconditions. We then effortlessly boost the porosity simulation capability to\nthe realistic, full-component level. yNet is generally applicable to simulating\nvarious structural/morphological evolutions and other condition-concerned,\ncontinuous field evolvements even with spatially and/or temporally non-uniform\nevolving kinetics. Once trained, the light-weight yNet can be distributed\neasily and ran with limited computational resource while reducing computation\ntime to a split second. It thus may have a transformative impact by\ndemocratizing the capability of ultra-fast and extreme-scale simulation of\nvarious field evolvements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Dec 2020 02:09:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-22"}

However, due to the\nnon-smooth synthesis method, the fake samples in this dataset may expose\nobvious artifacts (e.g., stark visual contrast, non-smooth boundary), which\nwere heavily relied on by most of the frame-level detection methods above. As\nthese artifacts do not come up in real media forgeries, the above methods can\nsuffer from a large degradation when applied to fake images that close to\nreality. To improve the robustness for high-realism fake data, we propose the\nInvariant Texture Learning (InTeLe) framework, which only accesses the\npublished dataset with low visual quality. Our method is based on the prior\nthat the microscopic facial texture of the source face is inevitably violated\nby the texture transferred from the target person, which can hence be regarded\nas the invariant characterization shared among all fake images. To learn such\nan invariance for deepfake detection, our InTeLe introduces an auto-encoder\nframework with different decoders for pristine and fake images, which are\nfurther appended with a shallow classifier in order to separate out the obvious\nartifact-effect. Equipped with such a separation, the extracted embedding by\nencoder can capture the texture violation in fake images, followed by the\nclassifier for the final pristine/fake prediction. As a theoretical guarantee,\nwe prove the identifiability of such an invariance texture violation, i.e., to\nbe precisely inferred from observational data. The effectiveness and utility of\nour method are demonstrated by promising generalization ability from\nlow-quality images with obvious artifacts to fake images with high realism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Dec 2020 03:02:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-22"}

For concrete ones, based on Grossi and\nModgil's recent work, this paper considers some issues on graded\nextension-based semantics of abstract argumentation framework (AAF, for short).\nFirst, an alternative fundamental lemma is given, which generalizes the\ncorresponding result due to Grossi and Modgil by relaxing the constraint on\nparameters. This lemma provides a new sufficient condition for preserving\nconflict-freeness and brings a Galois adjunction between admissible sets and\ncomplete extensions, which is of vital importance in constructing some special\nextensions in terms of iterations of the defense function. Applying such a\nlemma, some flaws in Grossi and Modgil's work are corrected, and the structural\nproperty and universal definability of various extension-based semantics are\ngiven. Second, an operator so-called reduced meet modulo an ultrafilter is\npresented, which is a simple but powerful tool in exploring infinite AAFs. The\nneutrality function and the defense function, which play central roles in\nDung's abstract argumentation theory, are shown to be distributive over reduced\nmeets modulo any ultrafilter. A variety of fundamental semantics of AAFs,\nincluding conflict-free, admissible, complete and stable semantics, etc, are\nshown to be closed under this operator. Based on this fact, a number of\napplications of such operators are considered. In particular, we provide a\nsimple and uniform method to prove the universal definability of a family of\nrange related semantics. Since all graded concrete semantics considered in this\npaper are generalizations of corresponding non-graded ones, all results about\nthem obtained in this paper also hold in the traditional situation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Dec 2020 04:32:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 27 Dec 2020 01:41:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 20 May 2021 04:58:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-21"}

Based on our previous study on Wheel-INS \\cite{niu2019}, a\nwheel-mounted inertial measurement unit (Wheel-IMU)-based dead reckoning (DR)\nsystem, in this paper, we propose a multiple IMUs-based DR solution for the\nwheeled robots. The IMUs are mounted at different places of the wheeled\nvehicles to acquire various dynamic information. In particular, at least one\nIMU has to be mounted at the wheel to measure the wheel velocity and take\nadvantages of the rotation modulation. The system is implemented through a\ndistributed extended Kalman filter structure where each subsystem\n(corresponding to each IMU) retains and updates its own states separately. The\nrelative position constraints between the multiple IMUs are exploited to\nfurther limit the error drift and improve the system robustness. Particularly,\nwe present the DR systems using dual Wheel-IMUs, one Wheel-IMU plus one vehicle\nbody-mounted IMU (Body-IMU), and dual Wheel-IMUs plus one Body-IMU as examples\nfor analysis and comparison. Field tests illustrate that the proposed multi-IMU\nDR system outperforms the single Wheel-INS in terms of both positioning and\nheading accuracy. By comparing with the centralized filter, the proposed\ndistributed filter shows unimportant accuracy degradation while holds\nsignificant computation efficiency. Moreover, among the three multi-IMU\nconfigurations, the one Body-IMU plus one Wheel-IMU design obtains the minimum\ndrift rate.

We address this criticism\nby modeling linear gravity acting on small objects as an open quantum system.\nIn the strong coupling limit, when the model's unitless free parameter $\\sigma$\ngoes to infinity, the entropic master equation recovers conservative gravity.\nWe show that the proposed master equation is fully compatible with the\n\\textit{q}\\textsc{Bounce} experiment for ultra-cold neutrons as long as\n$\\sigma\\gtrsim 250$ at $90\\%$ confidence. Furthermore, the entropic master\nequation predicts energy increase and decoherence on long time scales and for\nlarge masses, phenomena which tabletop experiments could test. In addition,\ncomparing entropic gravity's energy increase to that of the Di\\'{o}si-Penrose\nmodel for gravity induced decoherence indicates that the two theories are\nincompatible. These findings support the theory of entropic gravity, motivating\nfuture experimental and theoretical research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Dec 2020 08:17:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Jul 2021 04:16:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-23"}

For given stellar mass, AGN\nhost galaxies and star-forming galaxies share the same SHMR, while quiescent\ngalaxies have more massive halos. Clustering analysis on halo scales reveals\nthat AGNs are surrounded by a larger number of satellites (with stellar mass\ndown to 1/1000 of the mass of the central galaxy) than star-forming galaxies,\nand that galaxies with larger stellar velocity dispersion have more satellites.\nThe number of satellites also increase with halo mass, reaching unity around\n$10^{12}h^{-1}\\rm M_{\\odot}$.

With the orthogonal case, enforced by the\nsymmetry in pure systems, mechanisms responsible for non-orthogonal\nspin-momentum locking (NOSML) have drawn little attention, although it has been\nreported on the topological surface of $\\alpha$-$Sn$. Here, we demonstrate\nthat, the presence of the spin-orbit scattering from dilute spinless impurities\ncan produce the NOSML state in the presence of a strong intrinsic spin-orbit\ncoupling in the pristine material.

The transition from IPv4 to IPv6 causes traditional\nnetwork scanning to become less useful. An increasing number of hosts is either\nIPv6-only or not publicly addressable via IPv4 due to the use of NAT, prompting\na need for network scanning techniques for the IPv6-based Internet. All current\napproaches to IPv6 network scanning make use of hitlists (lists of IPv6\naddresses to be scanned). A variety of methods for compiling hitlists have been\npresented, but they have a strong bias towards server hosts, and do not find\naddresses of client hosts -- smartphones, tablets, PCs, 'smart home' devices,\netc. -- in a significant amount. Client hosts are the majority of devices\nconnected to the Internet. Furthermore, when connected to a residential\nbroadband connection, they can exchange data at substantial speeds, making them\nattractive targets for botnets. Scanning residential broadband networks is\nchallenging because the active addresses are changing much more frequently than\naddresses of server hosts.\n  This master's thesis aims to adapt prior IPv6 network scanning techniques to\nresidential broadband networks. To this end, the following contributions are\nmade:\n  Description and evaluation of an IPv6 address space visualization method,\n  Introduction of the NTP Pool Project as a public and passive IPv6 hitlist\nsource detecting mostly client hosts, 'Smart Home' devices and CPEs,\n  Description of a scanning technique for Internet access provider networks,\n  Case study on the three major German residential broadband networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Dec 2020 10:38:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-22"}

Filter bank is one of the important parts of digital hearing\naid where the sub band gains of each filter can be tuned to compensate an\nindividuals unique hearing loss pattern. As the human perception is based on\nthe logarithmic scale, nonuniform filter bank outperforms uniform filter bank.\nThe main advantage of nonuniform filer bank is that it requires less number of\nsub-band filters, hence resulted in low hardware complexity and cost. Much\neffort has been devoted to design these nonuniform filter banks for hearing aid\napplications. This paper aimed to provide a review of previous researches based\non nonuniform finite impulse response (FIR) digital filter bank for hearing aid\napplication using frequency response masking (FRM) technique.

In this paper, we address\nthe problem of frame selection to improve the accuracy of action recognition.\nIn particular, we show that selecting good frames helps in action recognition\nperformance even in the trimmed videos domain. Recent work has successfully\nleveraged frame selection for long, untrimmed videos, where much of the content\nis not relevant, and easy to discard. In this work, however, we focus on the\nmore standard short, trimmed action recognition problem. We argue that good\nframe selection can not only reduce the computational cost of action\nrecognition but also increase the accuracy by getting rid of frames that are\nhard to classify. In contrast to previous work, we propose a method that\ninstead of selecting frames by considering one at a time, considers them\njointly. This results in a more efficient selection, where good frames are more\neffectively distributed over the video, like snapshots that tell a story.

Here we show that with argon in a 500 {\\mu}m diameter\ncapillary, the fields are still linear with a focusing gradient of 3.6 kT/m,\nwhich is an order of magnitude higher than the gradients of quadrupole magnets.\nThe current pulses that generate the magnetic field are provided by compact\nMarx banks, and are highly repeatable. These results establish active plasma\nlenses as an ideal device for pulsed particle beam applications requiring very\nhigh focusing gradients that are uniform throughout the lens aperture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Dec 2020 13:11:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-12"}

Satellite spectrum is a scarce resource that\nrequires highly efficient management schemes for optimized sharing by network\nusers. However, spectrum sharing is vulnerable to attacks by malicious protocol\nparticipants. In order to ensure efficient spectrum management in the face of\ndishonest satellite users or cyber attackers, it is important for spectrum\nsharing mechanism to provide transparency and traceability of the trading\nprocess so as to enable the system to detect, and hence eliminate, unauthorized\naccess by malicious users. We address these requirements by proposing the use\nof blockchain which, apart from its ability to provide transparency and\ntraceability, ensures an immutable means for keeping track of user trading\nreputation. Besides, in order to address the practical constraints of\nheterogeneous user nodes, we also propose the use of edge computing to support\nusers with limited computing power. In this paper, we propose a\nblockchain-based spectrum trading framework and, based on which, a multibeam\nsatellite spectrum sharing algorithm for interference pricing and heterogeneous\nspectrum demands is devised to improve the efficiency of satellite spectrum. By\nleveraging on the system characteristics of blockchain, a dynamic spectrum\nsharing mechanism with traceability, openness and transparency for whole\ntrading process is presented. Numerical results are also provided to evaluate\nthe system benefits and spectrum pricing of the proposed mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 19 Dec 2020 13:12:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-22"}

In fact those\nalgorithms have not been implemented in practice in large networks with\ntime-varying subbands. Deep reinforcement learning algorithms are promising\ntools for solving complex resource management problems. A major challenge here\nis that spectrum allocation involves discrete subband selection, whereas power\nallocation involves continuous variables.

Aerial images captured from UAVs\nhave applications in small and large scale texture mapping, 3D modelling,\nobject detection tasks, DTM and DSM generation etc. Photogrammetric techniques\nare routinely used for 3D reconstruction from UAV images where multiple images\nof the same scene are acquired. Developments in computer vision and deep\nlearning techniques have made Single Image Depth Estimation (SIDE) a field of\nintense research. Using SIDE techniques on UAV images can overcome the need for\nmultiple images for 3D reconstruction. This paper aims to estimate depth from a\nsingle UAV aerial image using deep learning. We follow a self-supervised\nlearning approach, Self-Supervised Monocular Depth Estimation (SMDE), which\ndoes not need ground truth depth or any extra information other than images for\nlearning to estimate depth. Monocular video frames are used for training the\ndeep learning model which learns depth and pose information jointly through two\ndifferent networks, one each for depth and pose. The predicted depth and pose\nare used to reconstruct one image from the viewpoint of another image utilising\nthe temporal information from videos. We propose a novel architecture with two\n2D CNN encoders and a 3D CNN decoder for extracting information from\nconsecutive temporal frames.

However, the\nDebye-H\\\"uckel (DH) theory that was developed later prevailed, and this theory\nhas a square root dependence. The derivation of the DH equation is not easy or\nintuitive, and has various uncertain elements, and the fit to data is not very\ngood for salts with non-unity valencies. We develop a model for the activity\ncoefficient based on the Coulomb force between an ion and its nearest-neighbour\nions of opposite charge, including the distribution of separations between the\nions. For a symmetric salt, we only have to analyze the interactions between\none cation and one anion, and we can derive an expression in the dilute limit\nthat depends on the Bjerrum length and the cube root of salt concentration,\nsimilar to a result already put forward by Bjerrum. For higher salt\nconcentrations or a non-zero size, numerical evaluation is required. For a 1:1\nsalt, this cube root dependence describes data of the activity coefficient very\nwell, both at low and intermediate salt concentrations, with also the prefactor\ncorrectly predicted. We also analyze an asymmetric 2:1 salt and 3:1 salt which\nrequires numerical solution of all possible orbits of two or three monovalent\nions around a central multivalent ion of opposite charge, and this calculation\nalso leads to a very good prediction of the activity coefficient that linearly\ndepends on the cube root of salt concentration up to moderate concentrations.\nFor 2:2 and 3:3 salts, numerical theory again fits data very well, but the cube\nroot limiting law does not apply.

A rich body of\nresearch in this area is performed under statistical diffusion models with\nprovable submodularity, which essentially simplifies the problem as the optimal\nresult can be approximated by the simple greedy search. When the diffusion\nmodels are non-submodular, however, the research community mostly focuses on\nhow to bound/approximate them by tractable submodular functions so as to\nestimate the optimal result. In other words, there is still a lack of efficient\nmethods that can directly resolve non-submodular influence maximization\nproblems. In this regard, we fill the gap by proposing seed selection\nstrategies using network graphical properties in a generalized threshold-based\nmodel, called influence barricade model, which is non-submodular. Specifically,\nunder this model, we first establish theories to reveal graphical conditions\nthat ensure the network generated by node removals has the same optimal seed\nset as that in the original network. We then exploit these theoretical\nconditions to develop efficient algorithms by strategically removing\nless-important nodes and selecting seeds only in the remaining network.

Such demand\ncan be fulfilled by leveraging the intensive and easy deployment of the\nInternet of Things (IoT) devices. The management and containment of such\nsituations also rely on cross-organizational and national collaboration. Thus,\nthis paper proposes an Intelligent-Health (I-Health) system that aims to\naggregate diverse e-health entities in a unique national healthcare system by\nenabling swift, secure exchange and storage of medical data. In particular, we\ndesign an automated patients monitoring scheme, at the edge, which enables the\nprompt discovery, remote monitoring, and fast emergency response for critical\nmedical events, such as emerging epidemics. Furthermore, we develop a\nblockchain optimization model that aims to optimize medical data sharing\nbetween different health entities to provide effective and secure health\nservices. Finally, we show the effectiveness of our system, in adapting to\ndifferent critical events, while highlighting the benefits of the proposed\nI-Health system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2020 23:41:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-29"}

Learner\nautonomy and self-regulated learning (SRL) in online learning settings are\nconsidered key success factors that predict student performance. SRL comprises\nprocesses of planning, monitoring, action and reflection according to\nZimmerman. And typically focuses on three key features of learners: (1) use of\nSRL strategies, (2) responsiveness to self-oriented feedback about learning\neffectiveness, and (3) motivational processes. SRL has been identified as\nhaving a direct correlation with students success, including improvements in\ngrades and the development of relevant skills and strategies. Such skills and\nstrategies are needed to become a successful lifelong learner. This chapter\nintroduces a Mobile Multimodal Learning Analytics approach (MOLAM). I argue\nthat the development of student Self-Regulated Learning would benefit from the\nadoption of this approach, and that its use would allow continuous measurement\nand provision of in-time support of student SRL in online learning contexts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2020 18:55:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-29"}
