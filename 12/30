The collimation of relativistic jets in galaxies is a poorly understood\nprocess. Detailed radio studies of the jet collimation region have been\nperformed so far in few individual objects, providing important constraints for\njet formation models. However, the extent of the collimation zone as well as\nthe nature of the external medium possibly confining the jet are still debated.\nMethods. In this article we present a multi-frequency and multi-scale analysis\nof the radio galaxy NGC 315, including the use of mm-VLBI data up to 86 GHz,\naimed at revealing the evolution of the jet collimation profile. We then\nconsider results from the literature to compare the jet expansion profile in a\nsample of 27 low-redshift sources, mainly comprising radio galaxies and BL\nLacs, classified based on the accretion properties as low-excitation (LEG) and\nhigh-excitation (HEG) galaxies. Results.The jet collimation in NGC 315 is\ncompleted on sub-parsec scales. A transition from a parabolic to conical jet\nshape is detected at $z_{t}=0.58\\pm0.28$ parsecs or ${\\sim}5\\times 10^3$\nSchwarzschild radii ($R_{S}$) from the central engine, a distance which is much\nsmaller than the Bondi radius, $r_{B}{\\sim}92$ $\\rm pc$, estimated based on\nX-ray data. The jet in this and in few other LEGs in our sample may be\ninitially confined by a thick disk extending out to ${\\sim}10^3$-$10^4$\n$R_{S}$. A comparison between the mass-scaled jet expansion profiles of all\nsources indicates that jets in HEGs are surrounded by thicker disk-launched\nsheaths and collimate on larger scales with respect to jets in LEGs. These\nresults suggest that disk winds play an important role in the jet collimation\nmechanism, particularly in high-luminosity sources. The impact of winds for the\norigin of the FRI/FRII dichotomy in radio galaxies is also discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Dec 2020 16:14:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-17"}

To\naddress the challenge, we propose a flexible robust MPC scheme by synergizing\nthe multi-stage and tube-based MPC approaches. The key idea is to exploit the\nnon-conservatism of the multi-stage MPC and the simplicity of the tube-based\nMPC. The proposed scheme provides two options for the user to determine the\ntrade-off depending on the application: the choice of the robust horizon and\nthe classification of the uncertainties. Beyond the robust horizon, the\nbranching of the scenario-tree employed in multi-stage MPC is avoided with the\nhelp of tubes. The growth of the problem size with respect to the number of\nuncertainties is reduced by handling \\emph{small} uncertainties via an\ninvariant tube that can be computed offline. This results in linear growth of\nthe problem size beyond the robust horizon and no growth of the problem size\nconcerning small magnitude uncertainties. The proposed approach helps to\nachieve a desired trade-off between optimality and complexity compared to\nexisting robust MPC approaches. We show that the proposed approach is robustly\nasymptotically stable.

Past near-infrared (NIR)\nsurveys, such as the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS), have shown the power of\nprobing large-scale structure at these latitudes. Our aim is to map the galaxy\ndistribution across the Southern Galactic plane using the VISTA Variables in\nthe V\\'ia L\\'actea Survey (VVV), which reach 2 to 4 magnitudes deeper than\n2MASS. We used SExtractor + PSFEx to identify extended objects and to measure\ntheir sizes, the light concentration index, magnitudes, and colours.\nMorphological and colour constraints and visual inspection were used to confirm\ngalaxies. We present the resulting VVV NIR Galaxy Catalogue of 5563 visually\nconfirmed galaxies, of which only 45 were previously known. This is the largest\ncatalogue of galaxies towards the Galactic plane, with 99% of these galaxies\nbeing new discoveries. We found that the galaxy density distribution closely\nresembled the distribution of low interstellar extinction of the existing NIR\nmaps. We also present a description of the 185 2MASS extended sources observed\nin the region, of which 16% of these objects had no previous description, which\nwe have now classified. We conclude that interstellar extinction and stellar\ndensity are the main limitations for the detection of background galaxies in\nthe Zone of Avoidance. The VVV NIR Galaxy Catalogue is a new data set providing\ninformation for extragalactic studies in the Galactic plane.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Dec 2020 17:06:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-13"}

Ion\nenergy distribution (IED) control is critical for precise material\nmodification, especially in atomic-level technologies such as atomic layer\netching. Since this control should be done in real time, it requires real-time\nfeedback using fast process sensors. In the general case of an industrial\nplasma reactor, when direct IED measurement is not possible, the IED can be\nestimated using the concept of a virtual IED sensor. In this paper, a similar\nvirtual IED sensor is considered using an asymmetric dual-frequency (df) rf CCP\ndischarge as an example. It is based on a fast calculation method of the IED at\nan rf-biased electrode. This approach uses the experimentally measured sheath\nvoltage waveform and plasma density (or ion flux) as input data, and also\nincludes Monte-Carlo simulation of ion motion in the sheath to take into\naccount the effect of ion-neutral collisions. To validate this approach,\nexperiments were carried out using various plasma diagnostics in several gases:\nargon and xenon as examples of plasma with atomic ions and nitrogen as an\nexample of plasma with molecular ions. It is shown that in all cases it is\npossible to obtain an adequate IED estimation, close to the experimental one,\nin a reasonably short time (~ tens of seconds when using a modern PC).

To tackle these\nproblems, we explore the visual modality using object detection and image\ncaptioning models to fetch the \"actual caption\" and then combine it with the\nmulti-modal representation to perform binary classification. This approach\ntackles the benign text confounders present in the dataset to improve the\nperformance. Another approach we experiment with is to improve the prediction\nwith sentiment analysis. Instead of only using multi-modal representations\nobtained from pre-trained neural networks, we also include the unimodal\nsentiment to enrich the features. We perform a detailed analysis of the above\ntwo approaches, providing compelling reasons in favor of the methodologies\nused.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Dec 2020 18:30:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-01"}

We study the three-dimensional structure\nand kinematics of its shells, lobes, knots, and haloes by combining radial\nvelocity mapping from multiple long-slit spectra with proper motion\nmeasurements from multi-epoch imaging. We find that the nebula has five\ndistinct ejection axes. The first is the axis of the bipolar, wind-blown inner\nshell, while the second is the axis of the lop-sided, elliptical, fainter, but\nmore massive intermediate shell. A further two axes are bipolar flows that form\nthe point symmetric, high-ionization outer lobes, all with inclinations close\nto the plane of the sky. The final axis, which is inclined close to the line of\nsight, traces collimated outflows of low-ionization knots. We detect major\nchanges in outflow directions during the planetary nebula phase, starting at or\nbefore the initial ionization of the nebula 3500 years ago. Most notably, the\nmajority of redshifted low-ionization knots have kinematic ages greater than\n2000 years, whereas the majority of blueshifted knots have ages younger than\n2000 years.

The SAIL attack,\nbased on tailored machine learning (ML) models, circumvents combinational logic\nlocking with high accuracy and is amongst the most potent attacks as it does\nnot require a functional IC acting as an oracle. In this work, we propose\nUNSAIL, a logic locking technique that inserts key-gate structures with the\nspecific aim to confuse ML models like those used in SAIL. More specifically,\nUNSAIL serves to prevent attacks seeking to resolve the structural\ntransformations of synthesis-induced obfuscation, which is an essential step\nfor logic locking. Our approach is generic; it can protect any local structure\nof key-gates against such ML-based attacks in an oracle-less setting. We\ndevelop a reference implementation for the SAIL attack and launch it on both\ntraditionally locked and UNSAIL-locked designs. In SAIL, a change-prediction\nmodel is used to determine which key-gate structures to restore using a\nreconstruction model. Our study on benchmarks ranging from the ISCAS-85 and\nITC-99 suites to the OpenRISC Reference Platform System-on-Chip (ORPSoC)\nconfirms that UNSAIL degrades the accuracy of the change-prediction model and\nthe reconstruction model by an average of 20.13 and 17 percentage points (pp)\nrespectively.

The MVGP distribution is then used to optimize the\nsystem behavior and ensure safety with high probability, by specifying control\nLyapunov function (CLF) and control barrier function (CBF) chance constraints.\nWe show that a safe control policy can be synthesized for systems with\narbitrary relative degree and probabilistic CLF-CBF constraints by solving a\nsecond order cone program (SOCP). Finally, we extend our design to a\nself-triggering formulation, adaptively determining the time at which a new\ncontrol input needs to be applied in order to guarantee safety.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Dec 2020 22:46:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 28 Aug 2021 01:04:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-25"}

After features are sorted according to their frequency,\nlinear support vector machine performs the classification in an incremental\nmanner. At last, a compact subset of discriminative features is selected by\ncomparing the prediction performance. Experimental results on breast cancer\ndata sets (BCDR-F03, WDBC, GSE 10810, and GSE 15852) suggest that the proposed\nframework achieves competitive or superior performance to elastic net and with\nconsistent selection of fewer features. How to further enhance its consistency\non high-dimension small-sample-size data sets should be paid more attention in\nour future work. The proposed framework is accessible online\n(https://github.com/NicoYuCN/elasticnetFR).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Dec 2020 00:08:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-01"}

We give a mapping between the Bell and Leggett-Garg experiments for\nmicroscopic qubits based on spin $1/2$ eigenstates and gedanken experiments for\nmacroscopic qubits based on two macroscopically distinct coherent states (cat\nstates). In this mapping, the unitary rotation of the Stern-Gerlach analyzer is\nrealized by an interaction $H=\\Omega\\hat{n}^{4}$ where $\\hat{n}$ is the number\nof quanta. By adjusting the time of interaction, one alters the measurement\nsetting.

In order to make this kind of valuable data usable for\ndownstream tasks like user profiling and personalized recommendation, attribute\ninference aims to infer users' missing attribute labels based on observed data.\nRecently, variational autoencoder (VAE), an end-to-end deep generative model,\nhas shown promising performance by handling the problem in a semi-supervised\nway. However, VAEs can easily suffer from over-fitting and over-smoothing when\napplied to attribute inference. To be specific, VAE implemented with\nmulti-layer perceptron (MLP) can only reconstruct input data but fail in\ninferring missing parts. While using the trending graph neural networks (GNNs)\nas encoder has the problem that GNNs aggregate redundant information from\nneighborhood and generate indistinguishable user representations, which is\nknown as over-smoothing. In this paper, we propose an attribute\n\\textbf{Infer}ence model based on \\textbf{A}dversarial \\textbf{VAE}\n(Infer-AVAE) to cope with these issues. Specifically, to overcome\nover-smoothing, Infer-AVAE unifies MLP and GNNs in encoder to learn positive\nand negative latent representations respectively. Meanwhile, an adversarial\nnetwork is trained to distinguish the two representations and GNNs are trained\nto aggregate less noise for more robust representations through adversarial\ntraining. Finally, to relieve over-fitting, mutual information constraint is\nintroduced as a regularizer for decoder, so that it can make better use of\nauxiliary information in representations and generate outputs not limited by\nobservations.

Vortical\nstructure dynamics is believed to be the driving mechanism in the transition\nregime in porous media based on the pore Reynolds number, $Re_p$. To examine\nthis assertion, a refractive-index matched randomly packed porous medium is\ndesigned to measure the scale of vortical flow structures in transition from\nunsteady laminar to turbulent using two-dimensional time-resolved Particle\nImage Velocimetry (PIV). Planar PIV data for $Re_p$ from 100 to 948 is used to\nquantify the scale in terms of the size, strength, and number density using two\ndifferent scalings (i) $Re_p$ macroscopic (global), and (ii) $Re_{\\langle\np\\rangle}$ microscopic (local). Direct measurement of vortex scale is\nquantified by employing swirl strength, vortex core, and enhanced swirl\nstrength vortex identification methods. These scales are compared with\nturbulent integral scales. Shear-dominant vortical structures in moderate\nunsteady laminar Reynolds numbers ($Re_p <300$) were observed, while the\nswirl-dominant flow structures appeared in weak turbulent Reynolds numbers\n($Re_p>500$). From the macroscopic point of view, increasing Rep resulted in,\n(i) reduction in the sizes of vortical structures to asymptotically to reach\n20$\\%$ of the global hydraulic diameter, (ii) growth in strength of vortices,\nand (iii) increase in the average number densities of vortices. From the\npore-scale (local) point of view, increasing $Re_{\\langle p\\rangle}$ led to\ndecrease in the size of vortical structures monotonically, (ii) rise of the\nstrength of vortices, and (iii) invariance in the number density of vortical\nstructures.

Despite such extraordinary variability, GRS\n1915$+$105 remained one of the brightest sources in the X-ray sky. However, in\nearly 2019, the source became much fainter, apparently entering a new accretion\nstate. Here, we report the results of an extensive, year-long monitoring\ncampaign of GRS 1915$+$105 with the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory. During this\ninterval, the flux of GRS 1915$+$105 gradually diminished; the observed count\nrate eventually dropped by two orders of magnitude. Simple but robust spectral\nfits to these monitoring observations show that this new state results from the\ncombination of a dramatic and persistent increase in internal obscuration, and\na reduced mass accretion rate. The internal obscuration is the dominant effect,\nwith a median value of $N_{H} = 7\\times 10^{23}~{\\rm cm}^{-2}$. In a number of\nobservations, the source appears to be Compton-thick. We suggest that this\nstate should be identified as the \"obscured state,\" and discuss the\nimplications of this new (or rarely observed) accretion mode for black holes\nacross the mass scale.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Dec 2020 04:27:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-10"}

In this\npaper, we explore conditions that allow us to explicitly describe how the\nprediction performance governs the optimization performance.

While the former is determined by the immunity of an\nindividual towards a disease, the latter depends on the duration of exposure to\nthe infection. We model the spatio-temporal propagation of a pandemic using a\ngeneralized SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Removed) model by introducing the\nsusceptibility and infectivity distributions to understand their combined\neffects, which appear to remain inadequately addressed till date. We consider\nthe coupling between $\\sigma_{inh}$ and $\\iota_{ext}$ through a new Critical\nInfection Parameter (CIP) ($\\gamma_c$). We find that the neglect of these\ndistributions, as in the naive SIR model, results in an overestimation of the\namount of infection in a population, which leads to incorrect (higher)\nestimates of the infections required to achieve the herd immunity threshold.\nAdditionally, we include the effects of seeding of infection in a population by\nlong-range migration. We solve the resulting master equations by performing\nKinetic Monte Carlo Cellular Automata (KMC-CA) simulations. Importantly, our\nsimulations can reproduce the multiple infection peak scenario of a pandemic.\nThe latent interactions between disease migration and the distributions of\nsusceptibility and infectivity can render the progression a character vastly\ndifferent from the naive SIR model. In particular, inclusion of these\nadditional features renders the problem a character of a living percolating\nsystem where the disease cluster survives by migrating from region to region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Dec 2020 06:04:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-01"}

Besides,\nover-reliance on the stand-alone depth estimator, requiring a large number of\npixel-wise annotations in the training stage and more computation in the\ninferencing stage, limits the scaling application in the real world.\n  In this paper, we propose an efficient and accurate 3D object detection\nmethod from stereo images, named RTS3D. Different from the 3D occupancy space\nin the Pseudo-LiDAR similar methods, we design a novel 4D feature-consistent\nembedding (FCE) space as the intermediate representation of the 3D scene\nwithout depth supervision. The FCE space encodes the object's structural and\nsemantic information by exploring the multi-scale feature consistency warped\nfrom stereo pair. Furthermore, a semantic-guided RBF (Radial Basis Function)\nand a structure-aware attention module are devised to reduce the influence of\nFCE space noise without instance mask supervision. Experiments on the KITTI\nbenchmark show that RTS3D is the first true real-time system (FPS$>$24) for\nstereo image 3D detection meanwhile achieves $10\\%$ improvement in average\nprecision comparing with the previous state-of-the-art method.

In\nthis paper, we propose a pessimistic variant of the value iteration algorithm\n(PEVI), which incorporates an uncertainty quantifier as the penalty function.\nSuch a penalty function simply flips the sign of the bonus function for\npromoting exploration in online RL, which makes it easily implementable and\ncompatible with general function approximators.\n  Without assuming the sufficient coverage of the dataset, we establish a\ndata-dependent upper bound on the suboptimality of PEVI for general Markov\ndecision processes (MDPs). When specialized to linear MDPs, it matches the\ninformation-theoretic lower bound up to multiplicative factors of the dimension\nand horizon. In other words, pessimism is not only provably efficient but also\nminimax optimal. In particular, given the dataset, the learned policy serves as\nthe \"best effort\" among all policies, as no other policies can do better. Our\ntheoretical analysis identifies the critical role of pessimism in eliminating a\nnotion of spurious correlation, which emerges from the \"irrelevant\"\ntrajectories that are less covered by the dataset and not informative for the\noptimal policy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Dec 2020 09:06:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 May 2021 15:05:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 4 May 2022 22:30:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-06"}

Recently, pre-trained language models (PrLMs) offer a new\nperformant method of contextualized word representations by leveraging the\nsequence-level context for modeling. Although the PrLMs generally give more\naccurate contextualized word representations than non-contextualized models do,\nthey are still subject to a sequence of text contexts without diverse hints for\nword representation from multimodality. This paper thus proposes a visual\nrepresentation method to explicitly enhance conventional word embedding with\nmultiple-aspect senses from visual guidance. In detail, we build a small-scale\nword-image dictionary from a multimodal seed dataset where each word\ncorresponds to diverse related images. The texts and paired images are encoded\nin parallel, followed by an attention layer to integrate the multimodal\nrepresentations. We show that the method substantially improves the accuracy of\ndisambiguation. Experiments on 12 natural language understanding and machine\ntranslation tasks further verify the effectiveness and the generalization\ncapability of the proposed approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Dec 2020 09:11:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-01"}

The swimmers' internal drive allows them to\noperate and remain active for a long duration (days) and their effective\nrepulsive interaction allows for a high density fluid phase. We find that above\na critical concentration, swimmers form a long lived crowded state that\ndisplays internal dynamics. When passive particles are introduced, the dense\nswimmer phase can re-arrange and spontaneously corral the passive particles. We\nderive a geometrical, depletion-like condition for corralling by identifying\nthe role the passive particles play in controlling the effective concentration\nof the micro-swimmers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Dec 2020 09:13:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-01"}

Due to the ill-posed nature, various regularizers have been\nexploited to reconstruct the 3D data from the 2D measurement. Unfortunately,\nthe accuracy and computational complexity are unsatisfied. One feasible\nsolution is to utilize additional information such as the RGB measurement in\nCASSI. Considering the combined CASSI and RGB measurement, in this paper, we\npropose a new fusion model for the HSI reconstruction. We investigate the\nspectral low-rank property of HSI composed of a spectral basis and spatial\ncoefficients.

Yet, why they work\nis not understood. Ultimately, they manage to classify data lying in high\ndimension -- a feat generically impossible due to the geometry of high\ndimensional space and the associated curse of dimensionality. Understanding\nwhat kind of structure, symmetry or invariance makes data such as images\nlearnable is a fundamental challenge. Other puzzles include that (i) learning\ncorresponds to minimizing a loss in high dimension, which is in general not\nconvex and could well get stuck bad minima. (ii) Deep learning predicting power\nincreases with the number of fitting parameters, even in a regime where data\nare perfectly fitted. In this manuscript, we review recent results elucidating\n(i,ii) and the perspective they offer on the (still unexplained) curse of\ndimensionality paradox. We base our theoretical discussion on the $(h,\\alpha)$\nplane where $h$ is the network width and $\\alpha$ the scale of the output of\nthe network at initialization, and provide new systematic measures of\nperformance in that plane for MNIST and CIFAR 10.

In over-parametrized nets, learning can operate in two regimes separated\nby a smooth cross-over. At large initialization, it corresponds to a kernel\nmethod, whereas for small initializations features can be learnt, together with\ninvariants in the data. We review the properties of these different phases, of\nthe transition separating them and some open questions.

In particular, a pure quaternion matrix can be used to represent\nred, green and blue channels of color images. A low-rank approximation for a\npure quaternion matrix can be obtained by using the quaternion singular value\ndecomposition. However, this approximation is not optimal in the sense that the\nresulting low-rank approximation matrix may not be pure quaternion, i.e., the\nlow-rank matrix contains real component which is not useful for the\nrepresentation of a color image. The main contribution of this paper is to find\nan optimal rank-$r$ pure quaternion matrix approximation for a pure quaternion\nmatrix (a color image). Our idea is to use a projection on a low-rank\nquaternion matrix manifold and a projection on a quaternion matrix with zero\nreal component, and develop an alternating projections algorithm to find such\noptimal low-rank pure quaternion matrix approximation. The convergence of the\nprojection algorithm can be established by showing that the low-rank quaternion\nmatrix manifold and the zero real component quaternion matrix manifold has a\nnon-trivial intersection point.

This study proposes to\ninvestigate the dependence of the stress field in periprosthetic bone tissue on\ni) the implant surface roughness, ii) material properties of bone and of the\nimplant, iii) the bone-implant contact ratio. To do so, a microscale 2-D finite\nelement model of an osseointegrated boneimplant interface was developed where\nthe surface roughness was modeled by a sinusoidal surface. The results show\nthat the isostatic pressure is not affected by the presence of the bone-implant\ninterface while shear stresses arise due to the combined effects of a\ngeometrical singularity (for low surface roughness) and of shear stresses at\nthe bone-implant interface (for high surface roughness). Stress-shielding\neffects are likely to be more important when the bone-implant contact ratio\nvalue is low, which corresponds to a case of relatively low implant stability.\nShear stress reach a maximum value at a distance from the interface comprised\nbetween 0 and 0.1 time roughness wavelength $\\lambda$ and tend to 0 at a\ndistance from the implant surface higher than $\\lambda$, independently from\nbone-implant contact ratio and waviness ratio.

This leads to modification of JT\nstabilization energy and to the warping of the trough at each fullerene site,\nas well as to the interaction of JT distortions at different sites. Here we\ninvestigate these effects in three fcc fullerides with A=K,Rb,Cs and in\nCs$_3$C$_{60}$ with bcc (A15) structure. DFT calculations of orbital vibronic\ncoupling constants at C$_{60}$ sites and of phonon spectra have been done for\nfully ordered lattices (1 C$_{60}$/u.c.).

The results show that the JT\nstabilization energy slightly increases compared to an isolated C$_{60}^{3-}$\nand a warping of the trough of few meV occurs. The interaction of JT\ndistortions on nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor fullerene sites is of similar\norder of magnitude. These effects arise first of all due to the interaction of\nC$_{60}$ sites with the displacements of neighbor alkali atoms and are more\npronounced in fcc fullerides than in the A15 compound.

Understanding spreading\npattern of COVID-19 has been widely recognized as a vital step for implementing\nnon-pharmaceutical measures. Previous studies investigated such an issue in\nlarge-scale (e.g., inter-country or inter-state) scenarios while urban\nspreading pattern still remains an open issue. Here, we fill this gap by\nleveraging the trajectory data of 197,808 smartphone users (including 17,808\nanonymous confirmed cases) in 9 cities in China. We find a universal spreading\npattern in all cities: the spatial distribution of confirmed cases follows a\npower-law-like model and the spreading centroid is time-invariant. Moreover, we\nreveal that human mobility in a city drives the spatialtemporal spreading\nprocess: long average travelling distance results in a high growth rate of\nspreading radius and wide spatial diffusion of confirmed cases. With such\ninsight, we adopt Kendall model to simulate urban spreading of COVID-19 that\ncan well fit the real spreading process.

This feature makes our protocol more easily applicable\nexperimentally, with the added advantage that it allows the desired state\nconversion to be carried out in a significantly shorter time with the same\ntotal laser pulse energy used.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Dec 2020 14:21:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 2021 06:47:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-24"}

The ground-truth heatmaps are usually constructed via\ncovering all skeletal keypoints by 2D gaussian kernels. The standard deviations\nof these kernels are fixed. However, for bottom-up methods, which need to\nhandle a large variance of human scales and labeling ambiguities, the current\npractice seems unreasonable. To better cope with these problems, we propose the\nscale-adaptive heatmap regression (SAHR) method, which can adaptively adjust\nthe standard deviation for each keypoint. In this way, SAHR is more tolerant of\nvarious human scales and labeling ambiguities. However, SAHR may aggravate the\nimbalance between fore-background samples, which potentially hurts the\nimprovement of SAHR. Thus, we further introduce the weight-adaptive heatmap\nregression (WAHR) to help balance the fore-background samples. Extensive\nexperiments show that SAHR together with WAHR largely improves the accuracy of\nbottom-up human pose estimation. As a result, we finally outperform the\nstate-of-the-art model by +1.5AP and achieve 72.0AP on COCO test-dev2017, which\nis com-arable with the performances of most top-down methods.

For small\nand moderate ac magnetic field amplitudes H0 with respect to particle\nanisotropy field Hk the SAR of the assembly as a function of the particle\ndiameter passes through a characteristic maximum and then reaches a plateau,\nwhereas for sufficiently large amplitudes, H0 ~ Hk, the SAR increases\nmonotonically as a function of particle diameter. This difference is a\nconsequence of realization of viscous and magnetic oscillation modes for\nparticle unit magnetization vector and director for moderate and sufficiently\nlarge H0 values, respectively. It is found that the SAR of the assembly changes\ninversely with the viscosity only in a viscous mode, for nanoparticles of\nsufficiently large diameters. In the developed magnetic mode the SAR of the\nassembly is practically independent of the viscosity, since in this case the\nnanoparticle director only weakly oscillates around the ac magnetic field\ndirection. At moderate amplitudes of the ac magnetic field the SAR values of\nthe assembly in the liquid and in the solid matrix are found to be close,\nexcept of the range of large particle diameters and sufficiently low viscosity.\nHowever, at large field amplitudes the SAR of randomly oriented assembly of\nnanoparticles in a solid matrix is approximately two times less than that in a\nliquid, because a significant fraction of nanoparticles of the assembly in the\nsolid matrix is not optimally oriented with respect to the ac magnetic field\ndirection.

Magnetic reconnection between the stripes\ndissipates the magnetic energy and powers jet acceleration. The striped jet\nmodel can explain the jet acceleration, large-scale jet emission, and blazar\nemission signatures consistently in a unified physical picture. Specifically,\nwe find that the jet accelerates to the bulk Lorentz factor $\\Gamma \\gtrsim 10$\nwithin one parsec distance from the central engine. The acceleration slows down\nbut continues at larger distances, with intrinsic acceleration rate\n$\\dot{\\Gamma}/\\Gamma$ between $0.0005~\\rm{yr^{-1}}$ and $0.005~\\rm{yr^{-1}}$ at\ntens of parsecs, which is in very good agreement with recent radio\nobservations.

We find that the magnetic ground state configuration of two\nmagnetic impurities depends not only on the distance between them but also\nexplicitly on their distance away from the boundary of the nanowire. As a\nconsequence, the magnetic ground state can switch from ferromagnetic to\nantiferromagnetic while keeping the inter-impurity distance unaltered by\nsimultaneously moving both impurities away from the boundary. The ground state\nmagnetic configuration of two impurities is found analytically in the weak\ncoupling regime and exactly for an arbitrary impurity coupling strength using\nnumerical tight-binding simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Dec 2020 15:57:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-14"}

Consequently, the exact impact of backdoors is not yet fully\nunderstood in complex real-world applications, such as in medical imaging where\nmisdiagnosis can be very costly. In this paper, we explore the impact of\nbackdoor attacks on a multi-label disease classification task using chest\nradiography, with the assumption that the attacker can manipulate the training\ndataset to execute the attack. Extensive evaluation of a state-of-the-art\narchitecture demonstrates that by introducing images with few-pixel\nperturbations into the training set, an attacker can execute the backdoor\nsuccessfully without having to be involved with the training procedure. A\nsimple 3$\\times$3 pixel trigger can achieve up to 1.00 Area Under the Receiver\nOperating Characteristic (AUROC) curve on the set of infected images. In the\nset of clean images, the backdoored neural network could still achieve up to\n0.85 AUROC, highlighting the stealthiness of the attack.

It is\nstill an open challenge to achieve the goal of data hiding that can be against\nthese compressions. Recently, deep learning has shown large success in data\nhiding, while non-differentiability of JPEG makes it challenging to train a\ndeep pipeline for improving robustness against lossy compression.

Based on\nthe assumption that the combined risk is a small fixed value, methods based on\nthis bound train a target classifier by only minimizing estimators of the\nsource risk and the distribution discrepancy.

This\npaper presents a generic and robust system for R-peak detection in Holter ECG\nsignals. While many proposed algorithms have successfully addressed the problem\nof ECG R-peak detection, there is still a notable gap in the performance of\nthese detectors on such low-quality ECG records. Therefore, in this study, a\nnovel implementation of the 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used\nintegrated with a verification model to reduce the number of false alarms. This\nCNN architecture consists of an encoder block and a corresponding decoder block\nfollowed by a sample-wise classification layer to construct the 1D segmentation\nmap of R- peaks from the input ECG signal. Once the proposed model has been\ntrained, it can solely be used to detect R-peaks possibly in a single channel\nECG data stream quickly and accurately, or alternatively, such a solution can\nbe conveniently employed for real-time monitoring on a lightweight portable\ndevice. The model is tested on two open-access ECG databases: The China\nPhysiological Signal Challenge (2020) database (CPSC-DB) with more than one\nmillion beats, and the commonly used MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database (MIT-DB).\nExperimental results demonstrate that the proposed systematic approach achieves\n99.30% F1-score, 99.69% recall, and 98.91% precision in CPSC-DB, which is the\nbest R-peak detection performance ever achieved.

The proposed method factorizes the original\nsystem into two levels of memory hierarchies, and solves it using parallel\ncyclic reduction on both distributed and shared memory. This method has a lower\ncommunication footprint across distributed memory partitions compared to\nconventional algorithms involving data transpose or re-partitioning.

For cyclic compact banded systems,\nthe method is a direct solver with a deterministic operation and communication\ncounts depending on the matrix size, its bandwidth, and the partition strategy.\nThe implementation and runtime configuration details are discussed for\nperformance optimization.

Accordingly,\nKazakov and Solodukhin considered the existence of back-reaction of the\nspacetime due to the quantum fluctuations of the background metric to deform\nSchwarzschild black hole, which led to change the intrinsic singularity of the\nblack hole to a 2-sphere with a radius of the order of the Planck length.

Consequently, the radial component of\n4-velocity and the proper energy density of the accreting fluid have a finite\nvalue on the surface of its central 2-sphere due to the presence of quantum\ncorrections.

That is,\nthe \"measurement problem\" is no problem at all; \"particle\" and \"wave\" derive\nfrom separate and different aspects of a set of observations. Such artificial\nconstructs as wave function collapse are irrelevant to the observation of\nindividual quanta, each of which acts as a whole \"particle\" from emission to\nmeasurement. The histogram of detected events is a collective property\nidentical to a classical wave interference pattern in the limit of large\nnumbers, as the CP decrees. For a specific quantum, Ockham's Razor renders\nirrelevant any hypothesis regarding wave- or particle-like behavior of the\nquantum in the region between emission and detection. To analyze actual data\nsets consisting of a large number of identical observation events and to\npredict future DSEs, the CP of standard quantum (wave) mechanics is sufficient:\nin the limit, the distribution of observations approaches the continuous\ndensity defined by the standard quantum mechanical wave function. Scientific\nprogress beyond this picture requires new, relevant experiments. From the DSE,\nOckham's Razor infers that a theoretical quantum system consists of at least\none quantum particle plus a wave function specifying the distribution of a\nlarge number of such particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 29 Dec 2020 20:05:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Jul 2022 16:49:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-29"}
