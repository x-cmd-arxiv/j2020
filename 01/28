Graph\nscattering transforms (GSTs) offer training-free deep GCN models that extract\nfeatures from graph data, and are amenable to generalization and stability\nanalyses. The price paid by GSTs is exponential complexity in space and time\nthat increases with the number of layers. This discourages deployment of GSTs\nwhen a deep architecture is needed. The present work addresses the complexity\nlimitation of GSTs by introducing an efficient so-termed pruned (p)GST\napproach. The resultant pruning algorithm is guided by a\ngraph-spectrum-inspired criterion, and retains informative scattering features\non-the-fly while bypassing the exponential complexity associated with GSTs.\nStability of the novel pGSTs is also established when the input graph data or\nthe network structure are perturbed.

Numerical tests showcase that pGST performs comparably to the\nbaseline GST at considerable computational savings. Furthermore, pGST achieves\ncomparable performance to state-of-the-art GCNs in graph and 3D point cloud\nclassification tasks.

If there are many such solutions an important question is how to\nselect amongst them. We study this question for the Multicommodity Flow\nCoalition Game, used to model cooperation between autonomous systems (AS) in\nthe Internet. In short, strategies are flows in a capacitated network. The\npayoff to a node is the total flow which it terminates. Markakis-Saberi show\nthis game is balanced and hence has a non-empty core by Scarf's Theorem. In the\ntransferable utility (TU) version this gives a polynomial-time algorithm to\nfind core elements, but for ASs side payments are not natural. Finding core\nelements in NTU games tends to be computationally more difficult. For this\ngame, the only previous result gives a procedure to find a core element when\nthe supply graph is a path. We extend their work with an algorithm,\nIncorporate, which produces many different core elements.\n  We use our algorithm to evaluate specific instances by generating many core\nvectors. We call these the Empirical Core for a game. We find that sampled core\nvectors are more consistent with respect to social welfare (SW) than for\nfairness (minimum payout). For SW they tend to do as well as the optimal linear\nprogram value $LP_{sw}$. In contrast, there is a larger range in fairness for\nthe empirical core; the fairness values tend to be worse than the optimal\nfairness LP value $LP_{fair}$. We study this discrepancy in the setting of\ngeneral graphs with single-sink demands. In this setting we give an algorithm\nwhich produces core vectors that simultaneously maximize SW and fairness. This\nleads to the following bicriteria result for general games. Given any\ncore-producing algorithm and any $\\lambda \\in (0,1)$, one can produce an\napproximate core vector with fairness (resp. social welfare) at least $\\lambda\nLP_{fair}$ (resp $(1-\\lambda) LP_{sw}$).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jan 2020 17:03:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Jan 2020 18:34:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-29"}

Prior studies applied the concept of direct policy search (DPS), in\nwhich the release policy is expressed as a set of parameterized functions\n(e.g., neural networks) that are optimized by simulating the performance of\ndifferent parameter value combinations over a testing period. The problem with\nthis approach is that the operators generally avoid adopting such artificial\nblack-box functions for the direct real-time control of their systems,\npreferring simpler tools with a clear connection to the system physics. This\nstudy addresses this mismatch by replacing the black-box functions in DPS with\nphysically based parameterized operating rules, for example by directly using\ntarget levels in dams as decision variables. This leads to results that are\nphysically interpretable and may be more acceptable to operators. The\nmethodology proposed in this work is applied to a network of five reservoirs\nand four power plants in the Nechi catchment in Colombia, with four interests\ninvolved: average energy generation, firm energy generation, flood hazard, and\nflow regime alteration. The release policy is expressed depending on only 12\nparameters, which significantly reduces the computational complexity compared\nto existing approaches of multiobjective DPS. The resulting four-dimensional\nPareto-approximate set offers a variety of operational strategies from which\noperators may choose one that corresponds best to their preferences. For\ndemonstration purposes, one particular optimized policy is selected and its\nparameter values are analyzed to illustrate how the physically based operating\nrules can be directly interpreted by the operators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jan 2020 17:31:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-28"}

The EfficientNet-B4\nframework was found to be most suitable to this problem, achieving validation\naccuracy of 90.6%, although EfficientNet-B0 achieved an accuracy of 90.3% with\nhalf the execution time. It was observed that VGG-16 with transfer learning\nproved to be very useful for data acquisition and pseudo-labelling with limited\nhardware resources, throughout this project. The EfficientNet-B4 framework was\nthen placed into a real-time production environment, where images could be\nclassified in real-time on an ongoing basis. The classified images were then\nused to construct a map showing real-time road conditions at various camera\nlocations across North America. The choice of these frameworks and our analysis\ntake into account unique requirements of real-time map building functions. A\ndetailed analysis of the process of semi-automated dataset labelling using\nthese frameworks is also presented in this paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jan 2020 18:07:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-28"}

The key question we address is when\nshould we use planning and when should we use control to achieve the task?\nPlanners are designed to find paths through complex configuration spaces, but\nfor highly underactuated systems, such as deformable objects, achieving a\nspecific configuration is very difficult even with high-fidelity models.\nConversely, controllers can be designed to achieve specific configurations, but\nthey can be trapped in undesirable local minima due to obstacles. Our approach\nconsists of three components: (1) A global motion planner to generate gross\nmotion of the deformable object; (2) A local controller for refinement of the\nconfiguration of the deformable object; and (3) A novel deadlock prediction\nalgorithm to determine when to use planning versus control. By separating\nplanning from control we are able to use different representations of the\ndeformable object, reducing overall complexity and enabling efficient\ncomputation of motion. We provide a detailed proof of probabilistic\ncompleteness for our planner, which is valid despite the fact that our system\nis underactuated and we do not have a steering function. We then demonstrate\nthat our framework is able to successfully perform several manipulation tasks\nwith rope and cloth in simulation which cannot be performed using either our\ncontroller or planner alone. These experiments suggest that our planner can\ngenerate paths efficiently, taking under a second on average to find a feasible\npath in three out of four scenarios. We also show that our framework is\neffective on a 16 DoF physical robot, where reachability and dual-arm\nconstraints make the planning more difficult.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jan 2020 18:10:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-31"}

It has been proposed\nthat bigger and denser cities are more resource-efficient than smaller ones\nbecause they tend to demand less infrastructure, consume less fuel for\ntransportation and less energy for cooling or heating in per capita terms. This\nhypothesis is also called Brand's Law. But as cities get bigger, denser and\nmore resource-efficient they also get richer. And richer inhabitants buy more,\nincreasing its resource demand and associated environmental impacts. To fully\nunderstand the nexus between population size or density and the environmental\nimpacts generated by a city, one needs to take into account both direct and\nindirect impacts. Facing the lack of empirical evidence on consumption-based\nemissions for cities, in this paper we propose a mean-field model to derive\nemissions estimations out of well-established urban metrics (city size,\ndensity, infrastructure, wealth). We aim at understanding if Brand's law holds\ntrue after adopting a consumption-based approach to urban emissions. The\nproposed model shows that when considering consumption-based emissions, in most\ncases Brand's law falls apart - bigger cities have greater purchase power,\nresulting in greater consumption of goods and higher associated GHG emissions.\nThe model also shows that decoupling between population and emissions is\npossible and dependent on the decoupling level between income and impacts. In\norder to achieve it, a shift in consumption patterns of most cities is of\nutmost importance, so that each new monetary unit added to the GDP, or any\nother income variable for that effect does not result in a proportional\nincrease in GHG emissions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jan 2020 18:43:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-28"}

Turbulence impedes the formation of particle clumps by\nacting as an effective turbulent diffusivity, but it can also promote\nplanetesimal formation by concentrating solids, for example in zonal flows. We\nquantify the effect of turbulent diffusivity using numerical simulations of the\nstreaming instability in small local domains, forced with velocity\nperturbations that establish approximately Kolmogorov-like turbulence. We find\nthat planetesimal formation is suppressed by turbulence once velocity\nfluctuations exceed $\\langle \\delta v^2 \\rangle \\simeq 10^{-3.5} - 10^{-3}\nc_s^2$. Turbulence whose strength is just below the threshold reduces the rate\nat which solids are bound into clumps.

We also quantify the initial planetesimal mass function using a\nnew clump-tracking method to determine each planetesimal mass shortly after\ncollapse. For models in which planetesimals form, we show that the mass\nfunction is well-described by a broken power law, whose parameters are robust\nto the inclusion and strength of imposed turbulence. Turbulence in\nprotoplanetary disks is likely to substantially exceed the threshold for\nplanetesimal formation at radii where temperatures $T \\gtrsim 10^3 \\ {\\rm K}$\nlead to thermal ionization.

However, how the\ninitial angular momentum of protostellar cores is distributed and evolves\nduring the main accretion phase and the beginning of disk formation has largely\nremained unconstrained up to now. In the framework of the IRAM CALYPSO survey,\nwe used high dynamic range C$^{18}$O (2-1) and N$_2$H$^+$ (1-0) observations to\nquantify the distribution of specific angular momentum along the equatorial\naxis in a sample of 12 Class 0 protostellar envelopes from scales ~50 to 10000\nau. The radial distributions of specific angular momentum in the CALYPSO sample\nsuggest two distinct regimes within protostellar envelopes: the specific\nangular momentum decreases as $j \\propto r^{1.6 \\pm 0.2}$ down to ~1600 au and\nthen tends to become relatively constant around 6 $\\times$ 10$^{-4}$ km\ns$^{-1}$ pc down to ~50 au. The values of specific angular momentum measured in\nthe inner Class 0 envelopes, namely that of the material directly involved in\nthe star formation process ($<$1600 au), is on the same order of magnitude as\nwhat is inferred in small T-Tauri disks. Thus, disk formation appears to be a\ndirect consequence of angular momentum conservation during the collapse. Our\nanalysis reveals a dispersion of the directions of velocity gradients at\nenvelope scales $>$1600 au, suggesting that they may not be related to\nrotational motions of the envelopes.

The\nproposed 1D cellular automata (CA) models with the Arrhenius type look-ahead\ninteractions implement stochastic rules for cars' movement following the\nconfiguration of the traffic ahead of each car. In particular, we take two\ndifferent look-ahead rules: one is based on the distance from the car under\nconsideration to the car in front of it; the other one depends on the car\ndensity ahead. Both rules feature a novel idea of multiple moves, which plays a\nkey role in recovering the non-concave flux in the macroscopic dynamics.\nThrough a semi-discrete mesoscopic stochastic process, we derive the\ncoarse-grained macroscopic dynamics of the CA model. We also design a numerical\nscheme to simulate the proposed CA models with an efficient list-based kinetic\nMonte Carlo (KMC) algorithm.

Here we compile the\nlargest study to date of 85 globular cluster (GC) systems around UDGs in the\nComa cluster, using new deep ground-based imaging of the known UDGs and\nexisting imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope of their GC systems. We find\nthat the richness of GC systems in UDGs generally exceeds that found in normal\ndwarf galaxies of the same stellar mass. These GC-rich UDGs imply halos more\nmassive than expected from the standard stellar mass-halo mass relation. The\npresence of such overly massive halos presents a significant challenge to the\nlatest simulations of UDGs in cluster environments. In some exceptional cases,\nthe mass in the GC system is a significant fraction of the stellar content of\nthe host galaxy. We find that rich GC systems tend to be hosted in UDGs of\nlower luminosity, smaller size and fainter surface brightness. Similar trends\nare seen for normal dwarf galaxies in the Coma cluster. A toy model is\npresented in which the GC-rich UDGs are assumed to be `failed' galaxies within\nmassive halos that have largely old, metal-poor, alpha-element enhanced stellar\npopulations. On the other hand, GC-poor UDGs are more akin to normal, low\nsurface brightness dwarfs that occupy less massive dark matter halos.\nAdditional data on the stellar populations of UDGs with GC systems will help to\nfurther refine and test this simplistic model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jan 2020 19:31:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-05"}

In\nthis problem we have a collection $J$ of $n$ jobs, each having a release time\n$r_j$, deadline $d_j$, and processing time $p_j$. They have to be scheduled\nnon-preemptively on $m$ identical parallel machines. The goal is to find a\nschedule which maximizes the number of jobs scheduled entirely in their\n$[r_j,d_j]$ window. This problem has been studied extensively (even for the\ncase of $m=1$). Several special cases of the problem remain open. Bar-Noy et\nal. [STOC1999] presented an algorithm with ratio $1-1/(1+1/m)^m$ for $m$\nmachines, which approaches $1-1/e$ as $m$ increases. For $m=1$,\nChuzhoy-Ostrovsky-Rabani [FOCS2001] presented an algorithm with approximation\nwith ratio $1-\\frac{1}{e}-\\varepsilon$ (for any $\\varepsilon>0$).

They also presented an algorithm with ratio $1-O(\\sqrt{\\log\nm/m})-\\varepsilon$ for general $m$ which approaches 1 as $m$ grows. The\napproximability of the problem for $m=O(1)$ remains a major open question. Even\nfor the case of $m=1$ and $c=O(1)$ distinct processing times the problem is\nopen (Sgall [ESA2012]). In this paper we study the case of $m=O(1)$ and show\nthat if there are $c$ distinct processing times, i.e. $p_j$'s come from a set\nof size $c$, then there is a $(1-\\varepsilon)$-approximation that runs in time\n$O(n^{mc^7\\varepsilon^{-6}}\\log T)$, where $T$ is the largest deadline.\nTherefore, for constant $m$ and constant $c$ this yields a PTAS.

For any choice inside\nthe {estimated} ranges, there is an acceptable concordance between the\ntheoretical predictions and observations. Whereas the model is established\nbased on some assumptions, it is vital to check their validity for the obtained\nvalues of the free parameters of the model. It is realized that the model is\nnot self-consistent for all values of the ranges and sometimes the assumptions\nare violated. Therefore, {to have both self-consistency and agreement with\ndata} the parameters of the model need to be {constrained} again.

These planets are\nprime candidates for formation by disc instability. Aims: We want to determine\nthe conditions for disc fragmentation around M dwarfs and the properties of the\nplanets that are formed by disc instability. Methods: We performed hydrodynamic\nsimulations of M dwarf protostellar discs in order to determine the minimum\ndisc mass required for gravitational fragmentation to occur. Different stellar\nmasses, disc radii, and metallicities were considered. The mass of each\nprotostellar disc was steadily increased until the disc fragmented and a\nprotoplanet was formed. Results: We find that a disc-to-star mass ratio between\n$\\sim 0.3$ and $\\sim 0.6$ is required for fragmentation to happen. The minimum\nmass at which a disc fragments increases with the stellar mass and the disc\nsize. Metallicity does not significantly affect the minimum disc fragmentation\nmass but high metallicity may suppress fragmentation. Protoplanets form quickly\n(within a few thousand years) at distances around $\\sim50$ AU from the host\nstar, and they are initially very hot; their centres have temperatures similar\nto the ones expected at the accretion shocks around planets formed by core\naccretion (up to 12,000K). The final properties of these planets (e.g. mass and\norbital radius) are determined through long-term disc-planet or planet-planet\ninteractions. Conclusions: Disc instability is a plausible way to form gas\ngiant planets around M dwarfs provided that discs have at least 30% the mass of\ntheir host stars during the initial stages of their formation. Future\nobservations of massive M dwarf discs or planets around very young M dwarfs are\nrequired to establish the importance of disc instability for planet formation\naround low-mass stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jan 2020 20:18:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-29"}

This\ndeficit was coined ``gallium anomaly'' and it has lead to speculations about\nbeyond-the-standard-model physics in the form of eV-mass sterile neutrinos.\nNotably, this anomaly has already defied final solution for more than 20 years.\nHere we reassess the statistical significance of this anomaly and improve the\nrelated statistical approaches by treating the neutrino experiments as repeated\nBernoulli trials taking into account the fact that the number of the detected\n$^{71}$Ge nuclei is quite small, thus calling for a Bayesian statistical\napproach. In addition, we take into account the systematic errors of the\nexperiments, their correlations, theoretical uncertainties and the number of\nbackground solar-neutrino events as a Poisson-distributed random variable. To\ncompare with the previously reported statistical significances of the anomaly\nwe convert the posterior intervals of our Bayesian approach to standard\ndeviations $\\sigma$ of the frequentist approach.

The study of the morphology of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) is an\nauspicious approach to understanding how magnetic fields are structured within\nCMEs. Although earlier studies have suggested an asymmetry in the width of CMEs\nin orthogonal directions, this has not been inspected using multi-viewpoint\nobservations. Methods. We inspect the early evolution (below ten solar radii)\nof the morphology of a dozen CMEs occurring under specific conditions of\nobserving spacecraft location and CME trajectory, favorable to reduce\nuncertainties typically involved in the 3D reconstruction used here. These\nevents are carefully reconstructed by means of a forward modeling tool using\nsimultaneous observations of STEREO EUVI and SDO/AIA as input when originating\nlow in the corona, and followed up in the outer fields of view of the STEREO\nand the SOHO coronagraphs. We then examine the height evolution of the\nmorphological parameters arising from the reconstructions. Results. The\nmulti-viewpoint analysis of this set of CMEs revealed that their initial\nexpansion --below three solar radii-- is considerably asymmetric and\nnon-self-similar. Both angular widths, namely along the main axes of CMEs\n($AW_L$) and in the orthogonal direction ($AW_D$, representative of the flux\nrope diameter), exhibit much steeper change rates below this height, with the\ngrowth rate of $AW_L$ found to be larger than that of $AW_D$, also below that\nheight. Angular widths along the main axes of CMEs are on average $\\approx$1.8\ntimes larger than widths in the orthogonal direction $AW_D$. The ratios of the\ntwo expansion speeds, namely in the directions of CMEs main axes and in their\northogonal, are nearly constant in time after $\\sim$4 solar radii, with an\naverage ratio $\\approx$1.6. Heights at which the width change rate is defined\nto stabilize are greater for $AW_L$ than for $AW_D$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jan 2020 21:01:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-25"}

In the most general setting of these types of problems, one or more\nsamples of data across multiple time series can be assigned several concurrent\nfault labels from a finite, known set and the task is to predict the\npossibility of fault occurrence over a desired time horizon. This type of\nproblem is usually accompanied by strong class imbalances where some classes\nare represented by only a few samples. Importantly, in many applications of the\nproblem such as fault prediction and predictive maintenance, it is exactly\nthese rare classes that are of most interest.

More importantly, PCHT conditions at the\ntransition points between boiling and evaporation were close to those of the\nkinetic limit of all these fluids. However, further increase of the heat flux\nbeyond the transition points led to decreasing HTC and deviation from the\nkinetic limit, which can be attributed to the increasing vapor resistance in\nthe vapor space and inside the nanopores. This increasing vapor resistance was\nalso confirmed by experiments on IPA with different vapor pressures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jan 2020 23:10:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Feb 2020 03:50:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-11"}

We attempt to solve this challenge in the context of\ndecentralized learning in multi-agent linear-quadratic (LQ) dynamical systems.\nWe begin with a simple setup consisting of two agents and two dynamically\ndecoupled stochastic linear systems, each system controlled by an agent. The\nsystems are coupled through a quadratic cost function. When both systems'\ndynamics are unknown and there is no communication among the agents, we show\nthat no learning policy can generate sub-linear in $T$ regret, where $T$ is the\ntime horizon. When only one system's dynamics are unknown and there is\none-directional communication from the agent controlling the unknown system to\nthe other agent, we propose a MARL algorithm based on the construction of an\nauxiliary single-agent LQ problem. The auxiliary single-agent problem in the\nproposed MARL algorithm serves as an implicit coordination mechanism among the\ntwo learning agents. This allows the agents to achieve a regret within\n$O(\\sqrt{T})$ of the regret of the auxiliary single-agent problem.\nConsequently, using existing results for single-agent LQ regret, our algorithm\nprovides a $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{T})$ regret bound.

In this work we analyze a\nstrategy for reducing output-side losses due to spatial mode mismatch between\noptical cavities with the use of adaptive optics.

The\nrange of actuation required is +47 uD on SR3, +140 mD on OM1 and OM2, +50 mD on\nthe SRM substrate, and -50 mD on the added new transmissive optic.

Its turbulent medium, still\nenergised by massive stars, can impact cosmic-ray transport locally. The gamma\nrays produced in cosmic-ray interactions with interstellar gas were used to\ncompare the GeV to TeV cosmic-ray spectrum in the superbubble and in other\nregions near the Sun. We used ten years of Fermi-LAT data in the 0.25-63 GeV\nenergy range to study the closer (Eridanus) end of the superbubble. We modelled\nthe spatial and spectral distributions of the gamma rays produced in the\ndifferent gas phases of the clouds found in this direction. We found that the\ngamma-ray emissivity spectrum of the gas along the outer rim and in a shell\ninside the superbubble is consistent with the average spectrum measured in the\nsolar neighbourhood. This result calls for a detailed assessment of the recent\nsupernova rate and census of massive stellar winds in the superbubble in order\nto estimate the epoch and rate of cosmic-ray production and to constrain the\ntransport conditions that can lead to such homogeneity and little\nre-acceleration.

Super-GeV cosmic rays should freely cross such a\ndiffuse atomic cloud without significant loss or spectral distorsion. We\ntentatively propose that the cosmic-ray loss relates to the orientation of the\nmagnetic field lines threading the cirrus, which point towards the halo\naccording to the dust polarisation data.

This pollution has been explained by ongoing\naccretion of planetary debris. The study of isolated and accreting MWDs is\nlikely to continue to yield exciting discoveries for many years to come.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jan 2020 02:44:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-29"}

Instead, one can attempt to derive\napproximations, such as upper bounds on tail probabilities. Such bounds can be\nobtained via concentration inequalities, which rely on the moments of a\ndistribution, such as the expectation (the first raw moment) or the variance\n(the second central moment). Tail bounds obtained using central moments are\noften tighter than the ones obtained using raw moments, but automatically\nanalyzing central moments is more challenging.\n  This paper presents an analysis for probabilistic programs that automatically\nderives symbolic upper and lower bounds on variances, as well as higher central\nmoments, of cost accumulators. To overcome the challenges of higher-moment\nanalysis, it generalizes analyses for expectations with an algebraic\nabstraction that simultaneously analyzes different moments, utilizing relations\nbetween them. A key innovation is the notion of moment-polymorphic recursion,\nand a practical derivation system that handles recursive functions.\n  The analysis has been implemented using a template-based technique that\nreduces the inference of polynomial bounds to linear programming. Experiments\nwith our prototype central-moment analyzer show that, despite the analyzer's\nupper/lower bounds on various quantities, it obtains tighter tail bounds than\nan existing system that uses only raw moments, such as expectations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jan 2020 03:01:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Mar 2021 06:46:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 8 Apr 2021 08:14:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-09"}

These GCN based\nrecommender models show superior performance compared to traditional works.\nHowever, these models suffer from training difficulty with non-linear\nactivations for large user-item graphs. Besides, most GCN based models could\nnot model deeper layers due to the over smoothing effect with the graph\nconvolution operation. In this paper, we revisit GCN based CF models from two\naspects. First, we empirically show that removing non-linearities would enhance\nrecommendation performance, which is consistent with the theories in simple\ngraph convolutional networks.

We envision that the complement\ntransmissions in two radio modes can be exploited to improve the overall relay\nperformance.

For the conducting\nhexatrienedithiolate junction, on the other hand, the electrode QFLs penetrate\ninto the channel region and produce split QFLs. With the highest occupied\nmolecular orbital entering the bias window and becoming a good transport\nchannel, the split QFLs are also accompanied by the nonlinear electrostatic\npotential drop and asymmetric Landauer residua-resistivity dipole formation.\nOur findings underscore the importance of the first-principles extraction of\nQFLs in nanoscale junctions and point to a new direction for the computational\ndesign of next-generation electronic, optoelectronic, and electrochemical\ndevices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jan 2020 06:14:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-08"}

Applied to discrete data with a\nfinite range several limitations of (time discrete) FT can be observed which\nare caused by the orthogonality mismatch of the trigonometric basis functions\non a finite interval. However, in the general situation of non-equidistant or\nfragmented sampling FT based methods will cause significant errors in the\nparameter estimation. Therefore, the classical Lomb-Scargle method (LSM), which\nis not based on Fourier series, was developed as a statistical tool for one\ndimensional data to circumvent the inconsistent and erroneous parameter\nestimation of FT. The present work deduces LSM for $n$-dimensional data sets by\na redefinition of the shifting parameter $\\tau$, to maintain orthogonality of\nthe trigonometric basis.

This is especially critical for planning in complex\nmulti-agent environments, where agents need to anticipate other agents'\nintentions and possible future actions. Traditional methods formulate the\nproblem as a Markov Decision Process, but the solutions often rely on various\nassumptions and become brittle when presented with corner cases. In contrast,\ndeep reinforcement learning (Deep RL) has been very effective at finding\npolicies by simultaneously exploring, interacting, and learning from\nenvironments. Leveraging the powerful Deep RL paradigm, we demonstrate that an\niterative procedure of self-play can create progressively more diverse\nenvironments, leading to the learning of sophisticated and robust multi-agent\npolicies. We demonstrate this in a challenging multi-agent simulation of\nmerging traffic, where agents must interact and negotiate with others in order\nto successfully merge on or off the road. While the environment starts off\nsimple, we increase its complexity by iteratively adding an increasingly\ndiverse set of agents to the agent \"zoo\" as training progresses. Qualitatively,\nwe find that through self-play, our policies automatically learn interesting\nbehaviors such as defensive driving, overtaking, yielding, and the use of\nsignal lights to communicate intentions to other agents. In addition,\nquantitatively, we show a dramatic improvement of the success rate of merging\nmaneuvers from 63% to over 98%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jan 2020 08:37:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-29"}

Coordinate descent\nalgorithms that enjoy a low per-iteration complexity have been employed to\nsolve the detection problem, but previous works typically employ a random\ncoordinate selection policy which leads to slow convergence. In this paper, we\ndevelop multi-armed bandit approaches for more efficient detection via\ncoordinate descent, which make a delicate trade-off between exploration and\nexploitation in coordinate selection. Specifically, we first propose a bandit\nbased strategy, i.e., Bernoulli sampling, to speed up the convergence rate of\ncoordinate descent, by learning which coordinates will result in more\naggressive descent of the objective function. To further improve the\nconvergence rate, an inner multi-armed bandit problem is established to learn\nthe exploration policy of Bernoulli sampling. Both convergence rate analysis\nand simulation results are provided to show that the proposed bandit based\nalgorithms enjoy faster convergence rates with a lower time complexity compared\nwith the state-of-the-art algorithm. Furthermore, our proposed algorithms are\napplicable to different scenarios, e.g., massive random access with\nlow-precision analog-to-digital converters (ADCs).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jan 2020 10:00:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-29"}

Unlike the approach favoured by prior\nstudies, this model is not described by free parameters and we do not use\nfitting procedures to match the observations. Instead, we use an analytical\nturbulence model coupled with constraints extracted from a 3D hydrodynamic\nsimulation of the solar atmosphere. We then compare the resulting asymmetries\nwith their observationally derived counterpart.\n  We find that stochastic excitation localised beneath the mode upper turning\npoint generates negative asymmetry for $\\nu < \\nu_\\text{max}$ and positive\nasymmetry for $\\nu > \\nu_\\text{max}$. On the other hand, stochastic excitation\nlocalised above this limit generates negative asymmetry throughout the $p$-mode\nspectrum. As a result of the spatial extent of the source of excitation, both\ncases play a role in the total observed asymmetries. By taking this spatial\nextent into account and using a realistic description of the spectrum of\nturbulent kinetic energy, both a qualitative and quantitative agreement can be\nfound with solar observations perfoemed by the GONG network. We also find that\nthe impact of the correlation between acoustic noise and oscillation is\nnegligible for mode asymmetry in the velocity spectrum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jan 2020 11:24:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-18"}

Most notably, graded monads (indexed by a\nmonoid) model effect systems and parameterised monads (indexed by pairs of pre-\nand post-conditions) model program logics. This paper studies the relationship\nbetween these two generalisations of monads via a third generalisation. This\nthird generalisation, which we call category-graded monads, arises by\ngeneralising a view of monads as a particular special case of lax functors. A\ncategory-graded monad provides a family of functors T f indexed by morphisms f\nof some other category. This allows certain compositions of effects to be ruled\nout (in the style of a program logic) as well as an abstract description of\neffects (in the style of an effect system). Using this as a basis, we show how\ngraded and parameterised monads can be unified, studying their similarities and\ndifferences along the way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jan 2020 11:41:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 1 May 2020 03:41:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-04"}

In particular, even when each fog node can coordinate only\nwith its closest neighbor, the total amount of workload processed by fog nodes\ncan be almost doubled under certain scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jan 2020 12:59:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-29"}

When only a single nanoparticle is embedded, the\nlocal resonance, induced through destructive interference between two different\nphonon wave paths, gives rise to several sharp and significant transmittance\ndips. On the other hand, when the number of embedded nanoparticles further\nincreases to ten, a stop band with complete phonon reflection is formed due to\nthe two-path resonance Bragg-like phonon interference. The wave packet\nsimulations further uncover that the stop band originates from the collective\nphonon resonances at the embedded nanoparticles.

Unfortunately, for many geographical\nsystems, there is no characteristic scale. In this case, the method of scaling\nshould be employed to make a spatial measurement and carry out mathematical\nmodeling. The basic idea of scaling is to find a power exponent using the\ndouble logarithmic linear relation between a variable scale and the\ncorresponding measurement results. The exponent is a characteristic parameter\nwhich follows a scaleful distribution and can be used to characterize the\nscale-free phenomena.

The solids are assumed to be moving rigid bodies, without\nany elastic properties. The model is a simplified case of the seven-equation\nBaer-Nunziato model of compressible multi-phase flows, and results in a\nnonlinear hyperbolic system with non-conservative products. The geometry of the\nsolid bodies is simply specified via a scalar field that represents the volume\nfraction of the fluid present in each control volume. This allows the\ndiscretization of arbitrarily complex geometries on simple uniform or adaptive\nCartesian meshes. Inside the solid bodies, the fluid volume fraction is zero,\nwhile it is unitary in the fluid phase. We prove that at the material\ninterface, i.e. where the volume fraction jumps from unity to zero, the normal\ncomponent of the fluid velocity assumes the value of the normal component of\nthe solid velocity. This result can be directly derived from the governing\nequations, either via Riemann invariants or from the generalized Rankine\nHugoniot conditions according to the theory of Dal Maso, Le Floch and Murat,\nwhich justifies the use of a path-conservative approach for treating the\nnonconservative products.

It is crucial that the parameters of these models are calibrated\ncarefully and ultimately it will be of interest to compare competing models to\ndecide which model is best suited for a particular purpose. In this\ncontribution, I demonstrate how Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC), which\nis already a popular tool in other areas of science, can be used for model\nfitting and model selection in a pedestrian dynamics context. I fit two\ndifferent models for pedestrian dynamics to data on a crowd passing in one\ndirection through a bottleneck. One model describes movement in\ncontinuous-space, the other model is a cellular automaton and thus describes\nmovement in discrete-space. In addition, I compare models to data using two\nmetrics. The first is based on egress times and the second on the velocity of\npedestrians in front of the bottleneck. My results show that while model\nfitting is successful, a substantial degree of uncertainty about the value of\nsome model parameters remains after model fitting. Importantly, the choice of\nmetric in model fitting can influence parameter estimates. Model selection is\ninconclusive for the egress time metric but supports the continuous-space model\nfor the velocity-based metric. These findings show that ABC is a flexible\napproach and highlight the difficulties associated with model fitting and model\nselection for pedestrian dynamics. ABC requires many simulation runs and\nchoosing appropriate metrics for comparing data to simulations requires careful\nattention. Despite this, I suggest ABC is a promising tool, because it is\nversatile and easily implemented for the growing number of openly available\ncrowd simulators and data sets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jan 2020 14:08:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-13"}

We then\ndiscuss a general residual constraint framework through which many augmented\nKrylov and recycling methods can both be viewed. We review several augmented\nand recycling methods within this framework. We then discuss some known\neffective strategies for choosing subspaces to recycle before taking the reader\nthrough more recent developments that have generalized recycling for (sequences\nof) shifted linear systems, some of them with multiple right-hand sides in\nmind. We round out our survey with a brief review of application areas that\nhave seen benefit from subspace recycling methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jan 2020 14:21:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Jul 2020 10:56:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2020 07:01:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-30"}

Starting from a previous\nwork in which we designed a partially distributed solution based on a cloud,\nhere we propose a fully-distributed algorithm. The key novelty of the approach\nin this paper is the design of a sparse controller to stabilize trajectories of\nthe nonlinear system at each iteration of the distributed algorithm. The\nproposed controller is based on the design of a stabilizing controller for\npolytopic Linear Parameter Varying (LPV) systems satisfying nonconvex sparsity\nconstraints. Thanks to a suitable choice of vertex matrices and to an iterative\nprocedure using convex approximations of the nonconvex matrix problem, we are\nable to design a controller in which each agent can locally compute the\nfeedback gains at each iteration by simply combining coefficients of some\nvertex matrices that can be pre-computed offline. We show the effectiveness of\nthe strategy on simulations performed on a multi-agent formation control\nproblem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jan 2020 14:25:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-29"}

The analysis of this data\ndisplayed an unexpected time shift between the hospital referrals and\nfatalities. This time shift, which does not conform to the SIR and SEIR models,\nwas explained by multi-stage SIR and SEIR models [21]. In this study we prove\nthat the delay for these models is half of the infectious period within a\nquadratic approximation, and we determine the epidemic parameters $R_0$, $T$\nand $I_0$ of the 2009 A(H1N1) Istanbul and Netherlands epidemics.These epidemic\nparameters were estimated by comparing the normalized cumulative fatality data\nwith the solutions of the SIR model. Two different error criteria, the $L_2$\nnorms of the error over the whole observation period and over the initial\nportion of the data, were used in order to obtain the best-fitting models. It\nwas observed that, with respect to both criteria, the parameters of \"good\"\nmodels were agglomerated along a line in the $T$-$R_0$ plane, instead of being\nscattered uniformly around a \"best\" model. As this fact indicates the existence\nof a nearly invariant quantity, interval estimates for the parameters were\ngiven. As the initial phase of the epidemics were less influenced by the\neffects of medical interventions, the error norm based on the initial portion\nof the data was preferred. However, the presented parameter ranges are well out\nof the range for the usual influenza epidemic parameter values. To confirm our\nobservations on the Istanbul data, the same error criteria were also used for\nthe 2009 A(H1N1) epidemic for the Netherlands, which has a similar population\ndensity as in Istanbul. As in the Istanbul case, the parameter ranges do not\nmatch the usual influenza epidemic parameter values.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jan 2020 14:26:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-29"}

Factor\nanalysis with one wave of data can then not distinguish between factor models\nwith a single factor versus those with two factors that are causally related.\nTherefore, unless causal relations between factors can be ruled out a priori,\nalleged empirical evidence from one-wave factor analysis for a single factor\nstill leaves open the possibilities of a single factor or of two factors that\ncausally affect one another. The implications for interpreting the factor\nstructure of psychological scales, such as self-report scales for anxiety and\ndepression, or for happiness and purpose, are discussed. The results are\nfurther illustrated through simulations to gain insight into the practical\nimplications of the results in more realistic settings prior to the convergence\nof the processes.

The problem of joint\ndeployment, phase shift design, as well as power allocation is formulated for\nmaximizing the energy efficiency with considering users' particular data\nrequirements. To tackle this pertinent problem, machine learning approaches are\nadopted in two steps. Firstly, a novel long short-term memory (LSTM) based echo\nstate network (ESN) algorithm is proposed to predict users' tele-traffic demand\nby leveraging a real dataset. Secondly, a decaying double deep Q-network (D3QN)\nbased position-acquisition and phase-control algorithm is proposed to solve the\njoint problem of deployment and design of the RIS. In the proposed algorithm,\nthe base station, which controls the RIS by a controller, acts as an agent. The\nagent periodically observes the state of the RIS-enhanced system for attaining\nthe optimal deployment and design policies of the RIS by learning from its\nmistakes and the feedback of users. Additionally, it is proved that the\nproposed D3QN based deployment and design algorithm is capable of converging\nwithin mild conditions. Simulation results are provided for illustrating that\nthe proposed LSTM-based ESN algorithm is capable of striking a tradeoff between\nthe prediction accuracy and computational complexity. Finally, it is\ndemonstrated that the proposed D3QN based algorithm outperforms the benchmarks,\nwhile the NOMA-enhanced RIS system is capable of achieving higher energy\nefficiency than orthogonal multiple access (OMA) enabled RIS system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jan 2020 14:37:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-29"}

At a more fundamental\nlevel, xA quasars are of special interest in studies of the physics of AGNs and\nhost galaxy evolution.

In this setting, it is proposed to\nconstruct an estimator minimizing the regularized negative log-likelihood by a\nnuclear norm penalty. Such an approach easily yields a low-rank matrix-valued\nestimator with positive entries which belongs to the set of row-stochastic\nmatrices in the multinomial case. Then, as a main contribution, a data-driven\nprocedure is constructed to select the regularization parameter in the\nconstruction of such estimators by minimizing (approximately) unbiased\nestimates of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) risk in such models, which generalize\nStein's unbiased risk estimation originally proposed for Gaussian data.

The effect that metallicity has on stellar structural\nproperties, and in particular the convective turnover timescale, leads the two\nmodern wind-braking formulations to predict a strong dependence of the torque\non metallicity. Consequently, they predict that metal rich stars spin-down more\neffectively at late ages (> 1 Gyr) than metal poor stars, and the effect is\nlarge enough to be detectable with current observing facilities. For example,\nthe formulations predict that a Sun-like (solar-mass and solar-aged) star with\n[Fe/H]=-0.3 will have a rotation period of less than 20 days. Even though old,\nmetal poor stars are predicted to rotate more rapidly at a given age, they have\nlarger Rossby numbers and are thus expected to have lower magnetic activity\nlevels.

However, whole-body imaging\nat 7 T or even higher fields remains challenging due to wave interference,\ntissue inhomogneities and high RF power deposition. Nowadays, proper RF\nexcitation of a human body in prostate and cardiac MRI is only possible to\nachieve by using phased arrays of antennas attached to the body (so-called\nsurface coils). Due to safety concerns, the design of such coils aims to\nminimize the local specific absorption rate (SAR) keeping the highest possible\nRF signal in the region of interest. All previously demonstrated approaches\nwere based on resonant structures such as e. g.dipoles, capacitively-loaded\nloops, TEM-line sections. In this study, we show that there is a better\ncompromise between the transmit signal and the local SAR using non-resonant\nsurface coils due to weaker RF near fields in the close proximity of their\nconductors. With this aim, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a first\nleaky-wave surface coil implemented as a periodically-slotted microstrip\ntransmission line. Due to its non-resonant radiation, the proposed coil induces\nonly slightly over half the peak local SAR compared to a state-of-the-art\ndipole coil, but has the same transmit efficiency in prostate imaging at 7 T.\nUnlike other coils, the leaky-wave coil intrinsically matches its input\nimpedance to the averaged wave impedance of body tissues in a broad frequency\nrange, which makes it very attractive for future clinical applications of 7 T\nMRI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jan 2020 15:27:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-29"}

One obvious explanation for this is that PT fails\nto describe the dynamics beyond shell-crossing. We test this idea by comparing\nmeasurements in $N$-body simulations to prescriptions based on PT but augmented\nwith adaptive smoothing to account for the formation of non-linear structures\nof various sizes in the multi-stream regime.

Pneumococcal vaccination (PCV13) for children (as well as older\nadults) in Russia was introduced in 2014, with no prior PCV7 use. While\npneumonia hospitalization rates, both in children and adults did not decrease\nin the following years, respiratory mortality rates did decline with time.\nMoreover, there is a strong association between antibiotic, including multidrug\nresistance and PCV13 vaccine serotypes for S. pneumoniae in children in Russia,\nand presence of S. pneumoniae among sepsis cases in Russia during the recent\nyears has been very low. Annual variability in influenza circulation may affect\nsome of the changes in respiratory mortality rates. Methods. We applied the\ninference method from our recent study of influenza-associated mortality in\nRussia to relate monthly respiratory mortality rates between 09/2010 and\n08/2019 to monthly indices of influenza circulation and baseline rates of\nmortality not associated with influenza, allowing for a potential trend in the\nbaseline rates starting 2015. Results. Baseline rates of respiratory mortality\nnot associated with influenza decreased with time starting from the 2014/15\nseason (with each season running from September to August), with the 2018/19\nbaseline rates of respiratory mortality per 100,000 individuals being lower by\n12.41 (95% CI (10.6,14.2)) compared to the 2010-2014 period. Conclusions. While\nimprovement in care might have contributed to the reduction in the rates of\nrespiratory mortality not associated with influenza in Russia, the above\ntemporally consistent reduction is compatible with the gradual replacement of\nvaccine serotypes in the transmission and carriage of S. pneumoniae following\nthe introduction of PCV13.

Conventional controllers such as proportional integral\nderivative (PID) or proportional integral (PI) are designed based on the\nlinearized small-signal model near the operating point. Therefore, the\nperformance of the controller during start up, load change, or input voltage\nvariation is not optimal since the system model changes by varying the\noperating point. The dual heuristic programming controller optimally controls\nthe boost converter by following the approximate dynamic programming.

When this data comes from multiple sources, for\nexample when evaluation of data against a machine learning model is offered as\na service, there can be privacy issues and legal concerns over the sharing of\ndata. Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) allows data to be computed on whilst\nencrypted, which can provide a solution to the problem of data privacy.\nHowever, FHE is both slow and restrictive, so existing algorithms must be\nmanipulated to make them work efficiently under the FHE paradigm. Some commonly\nused machine learning algorithms, such as Gaussian process regression, are\npoorly suited to FHE and cannot be manipulated to work both efficiently and\naccurately. In this paper, we show that a modular approach, which applies FHE\nto only the sensitive steps of a workflow that need protection, allows one\nparty to make predictions on their data using a Gaussian process regression\nmodel built from another party's data, without either party gaining access to\nthe other's data, in a way which is both accurate and efficient. This\nconstruction is, to our knowledge, the first example of an effectively\nencrypted Gaussian process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jan 2020 11:50:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-30"}

Together they form a powerful language to describe transformations\nof data. Among the different approaches to describing optics, one particular\ntype of optics, called profunctor optics, stands out.

In visual localization, multi-sensor fusion,\nmulti-process fusion of a single sensing modality, and even combinations of\ndifferent localization techniques have been shown to result in improved\nperformance. However, merely fusing together different localization techniques\ndoes not account for the varying performance characteristics of different\nlocalization techniques. In this paper we present a novel, hierarchical\nlocalization system that explicitly benefits from three varying characteristics\nof localization techniques: the distribution of their localization hypotheses,\ntheir appearance- and viewpoint-invariant properties, and the resulting\ndifferences in where in an environment each system works well and fails. We\nshow how two techniques deployed hierarchically work better than in parallel\nfusion, how combining two different techniques works better than two levels of\na single technique, even when the single technique has superior individual\nperformance, and develop two and three-tier hierarchical structures that\nprogressively improve localization performance. Finally, we develop a stacked\nhierarchical framework where localization hypotheses from techniques with\ncomplementary characteristics are concatenated at each layer, significantly\nimproving retention of the correct hypothesis through to the final localization\nstage. Using two challenging datasets, we show the proposed system\noutperforming state-of-the-art techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jan 2020 00:34:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-11"}

Uncovering\nthe main modes of spatial and temporal variability in Earth data is essential\nto analyze and understand the underlying physical dynamics and processes\ndriving the Earth System. Dimensionality reduction methods can work with\nspatio-temporal datasets and decompose the information efficiently. Principal\nComponent Analysis (PCA), also known as Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF) in\ngeophysics, has been traditionally used to analyze climatic data. However, when\nnonlinear feature relations are present, PCA/EOF fails. In this work, we\npropose a nonlinear PCA method to deal with spatio-temporal Earth System data.\nThe proposed method, called Rotated Complex Kernel PCA (ROCK-PCA for short),\nworks in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces to account for nonlinear processes,\noperates in the complex kernel domain to account for both space and time\nfeatures, and adds an extra rotation for improved flexibility. The result is an\nexplicitly resolved spatio-temporal decomposition of the Earth data cube. The\nmethod is unsupervised and computationally very efficient.We illustrate its\nability to uncover spatio-temporal patterns using synthetic experiments and\nreal data. Results of the decomposition of three essential climate variables\nare shown: satellite-based global Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) and Soil\nMoisture (SM), and reanalysis Sea Surface Temperature (SST) data. The ROCK-PCA\nmethod allows identifying their annual and seasonal oscillations, as well as\ntheir non-seasonal trends and spatial variability patterns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jan 2020 16:59:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-12"}
