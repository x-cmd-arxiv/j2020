When the magnetic\nglassy states are suppressed by small field, several remarkable features\nappear.

These observations were taken as\nevidence that the final 10-15% of Earth's accreted material derived from a\nhomogeneous inner disk reservoir with an enstatite chondrite-like isotopic\ncomposition.

These observations indicate that the final stages of Earth's\naccretion were heterogeneous and consisted of a mixture of NC and CC materials.\nThe Mo-Ru isotope systematics are best accounted for by either an NC heritage\nof the late veneer combined with a CC heritage of the Moon-forming giant\nimpactor, or by mixed NC-CC compositions for both components. The involvement\nof CC bodies in the late-stage accretionary assemblage of Earth is consistent\nwith chemical models for core-mantle differentiation, which argue for the\naddition of more oxidized and volatile-rich material toward the end of Earth's\nformation.

Using the known\nbehavior of the solution, universal discretizations have been constructed for\nthe solution of the Dirichlet problem. However, the leading order behavior of\nsolutions to the Neumann problem is $O(t^{\\mu})$ for $\\mu \\in (-1/2,0)$\ndepending on the angle at the corner (compared to $O(C+t^{\\mu})$ with $\\mu>1/2$\nfor the Dirichlet problem); this presents a significant challenge in the design\nof universal discretizations. Our approach is based on using the discretization\nfor the Dirichlet problem in order to compute a solution in the \"weak sense\" by\nsolving an adjoint linear system; namely, it can be used to compute inner\nproducts with smooth functions accurately, but it cannot be interpolated.\nFurthermore we present a procedure to obtain accurate solutions arbitrarily\nclose to the corner, by solving a sequence of small local subproblems in the\nvicinity of that corner. The results are illustrated with several numerical\nexamples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jan 2020 17:05:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-16"}

Unlike robots, humans almost immediately know how to manipulate objects\nfor grasping due to learning over the years. A grown woman can grasp objects\nmore skilfully than a child because of learning skills developed over years,\nthe absence of which in the present day robotic grasping compels it to perform\nwell below the human object grasping benchmarks. In this paper we have taken up\nthe challenge of developing learning based pose estimation by decomposing the\nproblem into both position and orientation learning. More specifically, for\ngrasp position estimation, we explore three different methods - a Genetic\nAlgorithm (GA) based optimization method to minimize error between calculated\nimage points and predicted end-effector (EE) position, a regression based\nmethod (RM) where collected data points of robot EE and image points have been\nregressed with a linear model, a PseudoInverse (PI) model which has been\nformulated in the form of a mapping matrix with robot EE position and image\npoints for several observations. Further for grasp orientation learning, we\ndevelop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model which we name as Grasp Deep\nQ-Network (GDQN) and benchmarked our results with Modified VGG16 (MVGG16).\nRigorous experimentations show that due to inherent capability of producing\nvery high-quality solutions for optimization problems and search problems, GA\nbased predictor performs much better than the other two models for position\nestimation. For orientation learning results indicate that off policy learning\nthrough GDQN outperforms MVGG16, since GDQN architecture is specially made\nsuitable for the reinforcement learning.

There have been various useful efforts on trying to\neliminate them. However, these approaches either improve decoding algorithms\nduring inference, rely on hand-crafted features, or employ complex models. In\nour work, we build dialogue models that are dynamically aware of what\nutterances or tokens are dull without any feature-engineering. Specifically, we\nstart with a simple yet effective automatic metric, AvgOut, which calculates\nthe average output probability distribution of all time steps on the decoder\nside during training. This metric directly estimates which tokens are more\nlikely to be generated, thus making it a faithful evaluation of the model\ndiversity (i.e., for diverse models, the token probabilities should be more\nevenly distributed rather than peaked at a few dull tokens). We then leverage\nthis novel metric to propose three models that promote diversity without losing\nrelevance. The first model, MinAvgOut, directly maximizes the diversity score\nthrough the output distributions of each batch; the second model, Label\nFine-Tuning (LFT), prepends to the source sequence a label continuously scaled\nby the diversity score to control the diversity level; the third model, RL,\nadopts Reinforcement Learning and treats the diversity score as a reward\nsignal. Moreover, we experiment with a hybrid model by combining the loss terms\nof MinAvgOut and RL. All four models outperform their base LSTM-RNN model on\nboth diversity and relevance by a large margin, and are comparable to or better\nthan competitive baselines (also verified via human evaluation).

While there exist methods for hate speech detection,\nthey stereotype words and hence suffer from inherently biased training. Bias\nremoval has been traditionally studied for structured datasets, but we aim at\nbias mitigation from unstructured text data. In this paper, we make two\nimportant contributions. First, we systematically design methods to quantify\nthe bias for any model and propose algorithms for identifying the set of words\nwhich the model stereotypes. Second, we propose novel methods leveraging\nknowledge-based generalizations for bias-free learning. Knowledge-based\ngeneralization provides an effective way to encode knowledge because the\nabstraction they provide not only generalizes content but also facilitates\nretraction of information from the hate speech detection classifier, thereby\nreducing the imbalance. We experiment with multiple knowledge generalization\npolicies and analyze their effect on general performance and in mitigating\nbias. Our experiments with two real-world datasets, a Wikipedia Talk Pages\ndataset (WikiDetox) of size ~96k and a Twitter dataset of size ~24k, show that\nthe use of knowledge-based generalizations results in better performance by\nforcing the classifier to learn from generalized content.

The pruner is essentially a multitask deep\nneural network with binary outputs that help identify the filters from each\nlayer of the original network that do not have any significant contribution to\nthe model and can therefore be pruned. The pruner network has the same\narchitecture as the original network except that it has a\nmultitask/multi-output last layer containing binary-valued outputs (one per\nfilter), which indicate which filters have to be pruned. The pruner's goal is\nto minimize the number of filters from the original network by assigning zero\nweights to the corresponding output feature-maps. In contrast to most of the\nexisting methods, instead of relying on iterative pruning, our approach can\nprune the network (original network) in one go and, moreover, does not require\nspecifying the degree of pruning for each layer (and can learn it instead). The\ncompressed model produced by our approach is generic and does not need any\nspecial hardware/software support.

Even though it has been studied for over 150\nyears, there is neither a complete theoretical description of thermophoresis in\nliquids nor of the Soret coefficient, the quantifiying measure of the Soret\nequilibrium. Recent studies connect its nature to equilibrium properties of the\nsystem, namely the excess enthalpy and the excess entropy, while there is still\na debate over which of both describes the Soret coefficient more accurately and\nwhether it can even be represented using those quantities. In this work I\npresent a theoretical description for both cases based on density analysis by\nmeans of Brownian motion and dynamical density functional theory, where I\nassume local equilibrium. The interpretation of the Brownian stochastic\ndifferential equation (SDE) as an Ito or Stratonovich SDE is shown to have an\ninfluence on the outcome of the density.

Structured\nrelational models are a good candidate for this style of inference. In the\nsingle-site context, second order methods become feasible because the typical\ncubic costs associated with these methods is now restricted to the dimension of\neach coordinate. Our work, which we call Newtonian Monte Carlo (NMC), is a\nmethod to improve MCMC convergence by analyzing the first and second order\ngradients of the target density to determine a suitable proposal density at\neach point. Existing first order gradient-based methods suffer from the problem\nof determining an appropriate step size. Too small a step size and it will take\na large number of steps to converge, while a very large step size will cause it\nto overshoot the high density region. NMC is similar to the Newton-Raphson\nupdate in optimization where the second order gradient is used to automatically\nscale the step size in each dimension. However, our objective is to find a\nparameterized proposal density rather than the maxima.\n  As a further improvement on existing first and second order methods, we show\nthat random variables with constrained supports don't need to be transformed\nbefore taking a gradient step. We demonstrate the efficiency of NMC on a number\nof different domains. For statistical models where the prior is conjugate to\nthe likelihood, our method recovers the posterior quite trivially in one step.\nHowever, we also show results on fairly large non-conjugate models, where NMC\nperforms better than adaptive first order methods such as NUTS or other inexact\nscalable inference methods such as Stochastic Variational Inference or\nbootstrapping.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jan 2020 21:40:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-17"}

When applying a\ntopic model, a relatively standard pre-processing step is to first build a\nvocabulary of frequent words. Such a general pre-processing step is often\nindependent of the topic modeling stage, and thus there is no guarantee that\nthe pre-generated vocabulary can support the inference of some optimal (or even\nmeaningful) topic models appropriate for a given task, especially for computer\nvision applications involving \"visual words\". In this paper, we propose a new\napproach to topic modeling, termed Vocabulary-Selection-Embedded\nCorrespondence-LDA (VSEC-LDA), which learns the latent model while\nsimultaneously selecting most relevant words. The selection of words is driven\nby an entropy-based metric that measures the relative contribution of the words\nto the underlying model, and is done dynamically while the model is learned. We\npresent three variants of VSEC-LDA and evaluate the proposed approach with\nexperiments on both synthetic and real databases from different applications.\nThe results demonstrate the effectiveness of built-in vocabulary selection and\nits importance in improving the performance of topic modeling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jan 2020 22:16:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-17"}

In this work, we show that the minimum size of a context-free grammar\ngenerating a finite permutation group $G \\sqsubseteq S_n$ can be upper bounded\nby three structural parameters of connected graphs embedding $G$: the number of\nvertices, the treewidth, and the maximum degree.

Due to the high volatility of all three atomic species, we\nfind that LiZnSb can be grown in an adsorption-controlled window, using an\nexcess zinc flux. Within this window, the desired polar hexagonal phase is\nstabilized with respect to a competing cubic polymorph, as revealed by X-ray\ndiffraction and transmission electron microscopy measurements. First-principles\ncalculations show that for moderate amounts of epitaxial strain and moderate\nconcentrations of Li vacancies, the cubic LiZnSb phase is lower in formation\nenergy than the hexagonal phase, but only by a few meV per formula unit.\nTherefore we suggest that kinetics plays a role in stabilizing the desired\nhexagonal phase at low temperatures.

Computing these\nproperties for networks with missing attributes involves performing inference\nover the network. Statistical relational learning (SRL) and graph neural\nnetworks (GNNs) are two classes of machine learning approaches well suited for\ninferring missing attributes in a graph. In this paper, we study the\neffectiveness of these approaches in estimating aggregate properties on\nnetworks with missing attributes.

Theoretically, the balance of excitation and inhibition\ninputs is thought to account for spiking irregularity and critical avalanches\nmay originate from an underlying phase transition. However, the theoretical\nreconciliation of these multilevel dynamic aspects in neural circuits remains\nan open question. Herein, we study excitation-inhibition (E-I) balanced\nneuronal network with biologically realistic synaptic kinetics. It can maintain\nirregular spiking dynamics with different levels of synchrony and critical\navalanches emerge near the synchronous transition point. We propose a novel\nsemi-analytical mean-field theory to derive the field equations governing the\nnetwork macroscopic dynamics. It reveals that the E-I balanced state of the\nnetwork manifesting irregular individual spiking is characterized by a\nmacroscopic stable state, which can be either a fixed point or a periodic\nmotion and the transition is predicted by a Hopf bifurcation in the macroscopic\nfield.

The observed continuum luminosity of 10$^{35}$ \\ergsec is about two\norders of magnitude too low to explain the observed photoionized luminosity\nsuggesting a much more complex structure of the X-ray source which is partially\nor entirely obscured as had been previously suggested.

It is speculated that\nformation time of the same mass halos might be correlated with their baryonic\ncontent. To evaluate this hypothesis, we employ halos of mass above\n$10^{14}\\,M_{\\odot}$ realized by TNG300 solution of the IllustrisTNG project.\nFormation time is not directly observable. Hence, we rely on the magnitude gap\nbetween the brightest and the fourth brightest halo galaxy member, which is\nshown that traces formation time of the host halo.

Conditioning on the magnitude gap can reduce the\nscatter about halo property--halo mass relation and has a significant impact on\nthe conditional covariance. Reduction in the scatter can be as significant as\n30%, which implies more accurate halo mass prediction.

Based\non the Nakamoto consensus, Bagaria, Kannan, Tse, Fanti, and Viswanath proposed\nthe Prism protocol in 2018 and showed that it achieves near-optimal blockchain\nthroughput while maintaining a similar level of security as bitcoin. Previous\nprobabilistic security guarantees for the bitcoin and Prism backbone protocols\nwere either established under a simplified discrete-time model or expressed in\nterms of exponential order results. This paper presents a streamlined and\nstrengthened analysis under a more realistic continuous-time model. A fully\nrigorous model for blockchains is developed with no restrictions on adversarial\nminers except for an upper bound on their aggregate mining rate. The only\nassumption on the peer-to-peer network is that all block propagation delays are\nupper bounded by a constant.

However, to effectively train a high-quality\ndeep learning model, the aggregation of a significant amount of patient\ninformation is required. The time and cost for acquisition and annotation in\nassembling, for example, large fMRI datasets make it difficult to acquire large\nnumbers at a single site. However, due to the need to protect the privacy of\npatient data, it is hard to assemble a central database from multiple\ninstitutions. Federated learning allows for population-level models to be\ntrained without centralizing entities' data by transmitting the global model to\nlocal entities, training the model locally, and then averaging the gradients or\nweights in the global model. However, some studies suggest that private\ninformation can be recovered from the model gradients or weights. In this work,\nwe address the problem of multi-site fMRI classification with a\nprivacy-preserving strategy. To solve the problem, we propose a federated\nlearning approach, where a decentralized iterative optimization algorithm is\nimplemented and shared local model weights are altered by a randomization\nmechanism. Considering the systemic differences of fMRI distributions from\ndifferent sites, we further propose two domain adaptation methods in this\nfederated learning formulation. We investigate various practical aspects of\nfederated model optimization and compare federated learning with alternative\ntraining strategies. Overall, our results demonstrate that it is promising to\nutilize multi-site data without data sharing to boost neuroimage analysis\nperformance and find reliable disease-related biomarkers.

A fractional matching, which is a convex combination\nof integral matchings, is a natural extension of integral matchings. The topic\nof stability of fractional matchings has started receiving attention only very\nrecently. Further, incentive compatibility in the context of fractional\nmatchings has received very little attention. With this as the backdrop, our\npaper studies the important topic of incentive compatibility of mechanisms to\nfind stable fractional matchings. We work with preferences expressed in the\nform of cardinal utilities. Our first result is an impossibility result that\nthere are matching instances for which no mechanism that produces a stable\nfractional matching can be incentive compatible or even approximately incentive\ncompatible. This provides the motivation to seek special classes of matching\ninstances for which there exist incentive compatible mechanisms that produce\nstable fractional matchings. Our study leads to a class of matching instances\nthat admit unique stable fractional matchings. We first show that a unique\nstable fractional matching for a matching instance exists if and only if the\ngiven matching instance satisfies the conditional mutual first preference\n(CMFP) property. To this end, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm that makes\ningenious use of envy-graphs to find a non-integral stable matching whenever\nthe preferences are strict and the given instance is not a CMFP matching\ninstance. For this class of CMFP matching instances, we prove that every\nmechanism that produces the unique stable fractional matching is (a) incentive\ncompatible and further (b) resistant to coalitional manipulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jan 2020 05:19:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 Apr 2022 10:33:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-20"}

We\ndemonstrate that the possible Higgs modes for superconductors with non-trivial\ngap symmetry can lead to additional resonances if twice the driving frequency\nmatches the energy of these Higgs modes and we disentangle the influence of\ncharge density fluctuations (CDF) to the THG signal within our clean-limit\nanalysis. With this we show that THG experiments on unconventional\nsuperconductors allow for a detection of their Higgs modes. This paves the way\nfor future studies on realistic systems including additional features to\nunderstand the collective excitation spectra of unconventional superconductors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jan 2020 05:53:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 May 2020 17:27:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-26"}

Various forms of models have been proposed and im-proved\nfor learning at CNN. When learning with CNN, it is necessary to determine the\noptimal hyperparameters. However, the number of hyperparameters is so large\nthat it is difficult to do it manually, so much research has been done on\nautomation. A method that uses metaheuristic algorithms is attracting attention\nin research on hyperparameter optimization. Metaheuristic algorithms are\nnaturally inspired and include evolution strategies, genetic algorithms,\nantcolony optimization and particle swarm optimization. In particular, particle\nswarm optimization converges faster than genetic algorithms, and various models\nhave been proposed. In this paper, we pro-pose CNN hyperparameter optimization\nwith linearly decreasing weight particle swarm optimization (LDWPSO). In the\nexperiment, the MNIST data set and CIFAR-10 data set, which are often used as\nbenchmark data sets, are used. By opti-mizing CNN hyperparameters with LDWPSO,\nlearning the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, we compare the accuracy with a\nstandard CNN based on LeNet-5. As a result, when using the MNIST dataset, the\nbaseline CNN is 94.02% at the 5th epoch, compared to 98.95% for LDWPSO CNN,\nwhich improves accuracy. When using the CIFAR-10 dataset, the Baseline CNN is\n28.07% at the 10th epoch, compared to 69.37% for the LDWPSO CNN, which greatly\nimproves accuracy.

In this\npaper, we tried to provide a new method to do the forecast using the Long-Short\nTerm Memory (LSTM) deep learning model, which aims in the field of time-series\ndata. Utilizing LSTM, we collected the stream flow data from one hydrologic\nstation in Tunxi, China, and precipitation data from 11 rainfall stations\naround to forecast the stream flow data from that hydrologic station 6 hours in\nthe future. We evaluated the prediction results using three criteria: root mean\nsquare error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of\ndetermination (R^2). By comparing LSTM's prediction with predictions of Support\nVector Regression (SVR) and Multilayer Perceptions (MLP) models, we showed that\nLSTM has better performance, achieving RMSE of 82.007, MAE of 27.752, and R^2\nof 0.970.

Compared to efficacy analyses AE\nanalyses are often rather simplistic. The probability of an AE of a specific\ntype is typically estimated by the incidence proportion, sometimes the\nincidence density or the Kaplan-Meier estimator are proposed. But these\nanalyses either do not account for censoring, rely on a too restrictive\nparametric model, or ignore competing events. With the non-parametric\nAalen-Johansen estimator as the gold-standard, these potential sources of bias\nare investigated in a data example from oncology and in simulations, both in\nthe one-sample and in the two-sample case. As the estimators may have large\nvariances at the end of follow-up, the estimators are not only compared at the\nmaximal event time but also at two quantiles of the observed times. To date,\nconsequences for safety comparisons have hardly been investigated in the\nliterature. The impact of using different estimators for group comparisons is\nunclear, as, for example, the ratio of two both underestimating or\noverestimating estimators may or may not be comparable to the ratio of the\ngold-standard estimator. Therefore, the ratio of the AE probabilities is also\ncalculated based on different approaches. By simulations investigating constant\nand non-constant hazards, different censoring mechanisms and event frequencies,\nwe show that ignoring competing events is more of a problem than falsely\nassuming constant hazards by use of the incidence density and that the choice\nof the AE probability estimator is crucial for group comparisons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jan 2020 09:26:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-20"}

In this study, we build a two-stage framework that brings\nadaptivity to DSTV. We design an alternative to STV, which encodes the\nfirst-order information within a local neighborhood under the guidance of\nspatially varying directional descriptors (i.e., orientation and the dose of\nanisotropy). In order to estimate those descriptors, we propose an efficient\npreprocessor that captures the local geometry based on the structure tensor.\nThrough the extensive experiments, we demonstrate how beneficial the\ninvolvement of the directional information in STV is, by comparing the proposed\nmethod with the state-of-the-art analysis-based denoising models, both in terms\nof restoration quality and computational efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jan 2020 09:49:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-17"}

Most of the existing\nrelativistic hydrodynamics codes are based on formulations which rely on a\nfree-evolution approach of numerical relativity, where the metric variables are\ndetermined by hyperbolic equations without enforcing the constraint equations\nin the evolution. On the other hand, although a fully constrained-evolution\nformulation is theoretical more appealing and should lead to more stable and\naccurate simulations, such an approach is not widely used because solving the\nelliptic-type constraint equations during the evolution is in general more\ncomputationally expensive than hyperbolic free-evolution schemes. Multigrid\nmethods solve differential equations with a hierarchy of discretizations and\nits computational cost is generally lower than other methods such as direct\nmethods, relaxation methods, successive over-relaxation. With multigrid\nacceleration, one can solve the metric equations on a comparable time scale as\nsolving the hydrodynamics equations.

Many studies have focused on the\nemerging properties of cities, leading to the discovery of scaling laws\nmirroring, for instance, the dependence of socio-economic indicators on city\nsizes. Though scaling laws allow for the definition of city-size independent\nsocio-economic indicators, only a few efforts have been devoted to the modeling\nof the dynamical evolution of cities as mirrored through socio-economic\nvariables and their mutual influence. In this work, we propose a Maximum\nEntropy (ME), non-linear, generative model of cities. We write in particular a\nHamiltonian function in terms of a few macro-economic variables, whose coupling\nparameters we infer from real data corresponding to French towns.

The quasi time-invariance of the Hamiltonian\nmodel allows proposing an analytic model for the evolution in time of the\nmacro-economic variables, based on the Langevin equation.

Based on spectral modeling of integral field\nspectroscopy data from the CALIFA survey, we derive mass- and light-weighted\nstellar age gradients ($\\nabla$(t,B)L,M) within the photometrically determined\nbulge radius (RB) of a representative sample of local face-on late-type\ngalaxies that span 2.6 dex in stellar mass. Our analysis documents a trend for\ndecreasing $\\nabla$(t,B)L,M with increasing M,T, with high-mass bulges\npredominantly showing negative age gradients and vice versa. The inversion from\npositive to negative $\\nabla$(t,B)L,M occurs at logM,T ~ 10, which roughly\ncoincides with the transition from lower-mass bulges whose gas excitation is\npowered by SF to bulges classified as Composite, LINER or Seyfert. We discuss\ntwo limiting cases for the origin of radial age gradients in massive LTG\nbulges. The first assumes that the stellar age in the bulge is initially\nspatially uniform, thus the observed age gradients arise from an inside-out SF\nquenching (ioSFQ) front that is radially expanding with a mean velocity vq. In\nthis case, the age gradients translate into a slow ioSFQ that lasts until z~2,\nsuggesting mild negative feedback by SF or an AGN. If negative age gradients in\nmassive bulges are not due to ioSFQ but primarily due to their inside-out\nformation process, then the standard hypothesis of quasi-monolithic bulge\nformation has to be discarded in favor of a scenario that involves gradual\nbuildup of stellar mass over 2-3 Gyr through, e.g., inside-out SF and inward\nmigration of SF clumps from the disk. In this case, rapid AGN-driven ioSFQ\ncannot be ruled out.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jan 2020 11:10:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-01"}

The problem is non trivial if the agent runs on a limited computational\nbudget and has a bounded memory of past data. In a deep learning approach, the\nconstant computational budget requires the use of a fixed architecture for all\nincremental states. The bounded memory generates data imbalance in favor of new\nclasses and a prediction bias toward them appears. This bias is commonly\ncountered by introducing a data balancing step in addition to the basic network\ntraining. We depart from this approach and propose simple but efficient scaling\nof past class classifier weights to make them more comparable to those of new\nclasses. Scaling exploits incremental state level statistics and is applied to\nthe classifiers learned in the initial state of classes in order to profit from\nall their available data. We also question the utility of the widely used\ndistillation loss component of incremental learning algorithms by comparing it\nto vanilla fine tuning in presence of a bounded memory. Evaluation is done\nagainst competitive baselines using four public datasets. Results show that the\nclassifier weights scaling and the removal of the distillation are both\nbeneficial.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jan 2020 12:10:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-17"}

Loop heat pipes (LHPs) are such heat transport systems,\nwhich use evaporation and condensation to reach a higher heat transfer\ncoefficient than with sole heat conduction. The operating temperature of the\nLHP governs the temperature of the electronic components, but depends on the\namount of dissipated heat and the temperature of the heat sink. For this\nreason, a control heater on the LHP provides the ability to control the\noperating temperature at a fixed setpoint temperature. For the model-based\ncontrol design of the control heater controller, the current LHP state-space\nmodel in the literature focuses on the setpoint response without modeling the\nfluid's dynamics. However, the fluid's dynamics determine the disturbance\nbehavior of the LHP. Therefore, the fluid's dynamics are incorporated into a\nnew LHP state-space model, which is not only able to simulate the LHP behavior\nunder disturbance changes, but is also used for the model-based design of a\nrobust nonlinear controller, which achieves an improved control performance\ncompared to the nonlinear controller based on the previous LHP state-space\nmodel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jan 2020 13:34:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-17"}

However, an\nin-depth quantitative analysis on the output parameters is usually lacking in\nthis topic. The attention has been mostly paid to the power of dominant\ncontributions, whereas the accuracy and interpretation of other parameters\nuseful for practical applications have been almost systematically overlooked.\nThe questions that remain to be answered are: What is the actual role of all\nparameters describing the models?

The\npresent work aims to promote the discussion on these open issues regarding the\nquantitative assessment of model-based PolSAR decomposition schemes. To proceed\nwith, we have simulated the coherency matrix according to one of existing\ngeneral models and different scenarios. The inversion performance has been\nanalysed in terms of the histograms of output parameters, standard deviation\nand bias. The analysis reveals that even the backscattering powers associated\nwith all three basic scattering mechanisms are estimated with a non-negligible\nerror higher than 10% for some cases.

EE Cep is one of few eclipsing binary systems with a dark, dusty\ndisk around an invisible object similar to {\\epsilon} Aur. The system is\ncharacterized by grey and asymmetric eclipses every 5.6 yr, with a significant\nvariation in their photometric depth, ranging from ~ 0 m .5 to ~ 2 m .0. Aims.\nThe main aim of the observational campaign of the EE Cep eclipse in 2014 was to\ntest the model of disk precession (Galan et al. 2012). We expected that this\neclipse would be one of the deepest with a depth of ~ 2 m .0. Methods. We\ncollected multicolor observations from almost 30 instruments located in Europe\nand North America. This photometric data covers 243 nights during and around\nthe eclipse. We also analyse the low- and high-resolution spectra from several\ninstruments. Results. The eclipse was shallow with a depth of 0 m .71 in\nV-band. The multicolor photometry illustrates small color changes during the\neclipse with a total amplitude of order ~ +0 m . 15 in B-I color index. The\nlinear ephemeris for this system is updated by including new times of minima,\nmeasured from the three most recent eclipses at epochs E = 9, 10 and 11. New\nspectroscopic observations were acquired, covering orbital phases around the\neclipse, which were not observed in the past and increased the data sample,\nfilling some gaps and giving a better insight into the evolution of the H\n{\\alpha} and NaI spectral line profiles during the primary eclipse.\nConclusions. The eclipse of EE Cep in 2014 was shallower than expected 0 m .71\ninstead of ~ 2 m . 0. This means that our model of disk precession needs\nrevision.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jan 2020 15:31:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-08"}

Prior experiments measured a freestream turbulence\nintensity at the inflow to the cavity ranging from 10 - 15%. A synthetic\nturbulence inflow generator was implemented for the simulations in this work to\nreproduce the turbulence at the inflow to the cavity. Velocity perturbations\nand turbulence intensity generated by the turbulent inflow boundary condition\nare shown to match those values measured in the facility using particle induced\nvelocimetry. Simulations were performed both with and without inflow turbulence\nto study the effect of turbulence on flame stability and structure. In both\ncases, a cavity-stabilized flame was achieved. The inflow turbulence promoted\nmore robust combustion, causing the flame to propagate further from the cavity\ninto the core flow, broadening the flame angle with respect to the axial flow\ndirection. The flame angle captured in the simulation agrees with experimental\nresults and theoretical prediction. The cavity's vortex shedding frequency was\nidentified. Flame strain rate and pressure fluctuations in the cavity shear\nlayer were also measured and found to vary periodically at a frequency equal to\nthat of the vortex shedding. High flow strain rate in the cavity shear layer,\ndriven by the vortex shedding process, is identified as a cause of flame\nstretching and low OH concentrations as the flame traverses the cavity ramp.\nThe effect of spatial resolution on the simulations is discussed through a\ncomparison of cases using second-order and third-order accurate discontinuous\nGalerkin finite elements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jan 2020 15:34:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 18:53:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-29"}

To produce PBHs with this mass, the primordial scalar power spectrum\nneeds to be enhanced to the order of 0.01 at the scale $k\\sim 10^{12}\\\n\\text{Mpc}^{-1}$. The enhanced power spectrum also produces large secondary\ngravitational waves at the mHz band. A phenomenological delta function power\nspectrum is usually used to discuss the production of PBHs and secondary\ngravitational waves.

Pseudo-labeling works\nby applying pseudo-labels to samples in the unlabeled set by using a model\ntrained on the combination of the labeled samples and any previously\npseudo-labeled samples, and iteratively repeating this process in a\nself-training cycle. Current methods seem to have abandoned this approach in\nfavor of consistency regularization methods that train models under a\ncombination of different styles of self-supervised losses on the unlabeled\nsamples and standard supervised losses on the labeled samples. We empirically\ndemonstrate that pseudo-labeling can in fact be competitive with the\nstate-of-the-art, while being more resilient to out-of-distribution samples in\nthe unlabeled set.

As the cloud computing\ninfrastructure grows and demand increases, the need for a new breed of\non-demand computing that can efficiently maintain Quality of Service (QoS)\nrequirements has increased.

A bank of $J$ caches receives file requests and a\nutility is accrued for each request depending on the serving cache. The network\ndecides dynamically which files to store at each cache and how to route them,\nin order to maximize total utility. The request sequence is assumed to be drawn\nfrom an arbitrary distribution, thus capturing time-variance, temporal, or\nspatial locality of requests. For this challenging setting, we propose the\n\\emph{Bipartite Supergradient Caching Algorithm} (BSCA) which provably exhibits\nno regret ($R_T/T \\to 0$). That is, as the time horizon $T$ increases, BSCA\nachieves the same performance with the cache configuration that we would have\nchosen knowing all future requests.

In this paper, we propose a graph embedding\nmethod, called ExEm, that uses dominating-set theory and deep learning\napproaches to capture node representations. ExEm finds dominating nodes of the\ncollaborative network and constructs intelligent random walks that comprise of\nat least two dominating nodes. One dominating node should appear at the\nbeginning of each path sampled to characterize the local neighborhoods.\nMoreover, the second dominating node reflects the global structure information.\nTo learn the node embeddings, ExEm exploits three embedding methods including\nWord2vec, fastText and the concatenation of these two. The final result is the\nlow-dimensional vectors of experts, called expert embeddings. The extracted\nexpert embeddings can be applied to many applications. In order to extend these\nembeddings into the expert recommendation system, we introduce a novel strategy\nthat uses expert vectors to calculate experts' scores and recommend experts. At\nthe end, we conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of ExEm\nthrough assessing its performance over the multi-label classification, link\nprediction, and recommendation tasks on common datasets and our collected data\nformed by crawling the vast author Scopus profiles.

However, many current approaches rely on general-purpose\nlanguages, models and/or frameworks to design, develop and analyze autonomous\nsystems. Unfortunately, these tools are not tailored towards the\ncharacteristics of adaptation problems in autonomous systems. In this paper, we\npresent Optimal by Design (ObD ), a framework for model-based\nrequirements-driven synthesis of optimal adaptation strategies for autonomous\nsystems. ObD proposes a model (and a language) for the high-level description\nof the basic elements of self-adaptive systems, namely the system,\ncapabilities, requirements and environment. Based on those elements, a Markov\nDecision Process (MDP) is constructed to compute the optimal strategy or the\nmost rewarding system behaviour.

One novel feature of the framework\nis that it benefits both from goal-oriented techniques, developed for\nrequirement elicitation, refinement and analysis, and synthesis capabilities\nand extensive research around MDPs, their extensions and tools.

An increasingly common\nreview is a 'Methodology scoping review', which provides a summary of existing\nanalytical methods, techniques and software, proposed or applied in research\narticles, which address an analytical problem or further an analytical\napproach. However, guidelines for their design, implementation and reporting\nare limited.\n  Methods: Drawing on the experiences of the authors, which were consolidated\nthrough a series of face-to-face workshops, we summarise the challenges\ninherent in conducting a methodology scoping review and offer suggestions of\nbest practice to promote future guideline development.\n  Results: We identified three challenges of conducting a methodology scoping\nreview. First, identification of search terms; one cannot usually define the\nsearch terms a priori and the language used for a particular method can vary\nacross the literature. Second, the scope of the review requires careful\nconsideration since new methodology is often not described (in full) within\nabstracts. Third, many new methods are motivated by a specific clinical\nquestion, where the methodology may only be documented in supplementary\nmaterials. We formulated several recommendations that build upon existing\nreview guidelines. These recommendations ranged from an iterative approach to\ndefining search terms through to screening and data extraction processes.\n  Conclusion: Although methodology scoping reviews are an important aspect of\nresearch, there is currently a lack of guidelines to standardise their design,\nimplementation and reporting. We recommend a wider discussion on this topic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jan 2020 10:43:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-14"}

In this research, the\nimpact of El Ni\\~no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation\n(PDO), and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) on seasonal precipitation over Iran\nwas investigated. For this purpose, 103 synoptic stations with at least 30\nyears of data were utilized. The Spearman correlation coefficient between the\nindices in the previous 12 months with seasonal precipitation was calculated,\nand the meaningful correlations were extracted. Then the month in which each of\nthese indices has the highest correlation with seasonal precipitation was\ndetermined. Finally, the overall amount of increase or decrease in seasonal\nprecipitation due to each of these indices was calculated. Results indicate the\nSouthern Oscillation Index (SOI), NAO, and PDO have the most impact on seasonal\nprecipitation, respectively. Also, these indices have the highest impact on the\nprecipitation in winter, autumn, spring, and summer, respectively. SOI has a\ndiverse impact on winter precipitation compared to the PDO and NAO, while in\nthe other seasons, each index has its special impact on seasonal precipitation.\nGenerally, all indices in different phases may decrease the seasonal\nprecipitation up to 100%.

Previous studies tend to\naddress the issue by seq2seq learning from parallel sentence pairs, which takes\na complex sentence as input and sequentially generates a series of simple\nsentences. However, the conventional seq2seq learning has two limitations for\nthis task: (1) it does not take into account the facts stated in the long\nsentence; As a result, the generated simple sentences may miss or inaccurately\nstate the facts in the original sentence. (2) The order variance of the simple\nsentences to be generated may confuse the seq2seq model during training because\nthe simple sentences derived from the long source sentence could be in any\norder.\n  To overcome the challenges, we first propose the Fact-aware Sentence\nEncoding, which enables the model to learn facts from the long sentence and\nthus improves the precision of sentence split; then we introduce Permutation\nInvariant Training to alleviate the effects of order variance in seq2seq\nlearning for this task.

The\nparameters influencing discharge coefficient prediction were first examined and\npresented as crest height ratio to the head over the crest of the weir, a crest\nlength of water to channel width, a crest length of water to the head over the\ncrest of the weir, Froude number and vertex angle dimensionless parameters.\nDifferent models were then presented using sensitivity analysis in order to\nexamine each of the dimensionless parameters presented in this study. In\naddition, an equation was presented through the use of nonlinear regression\n(NLR) for the purpose of comparison with GEP. The results of the studies\nconducted by using different statistical indexes indicated that GEP is more\ncapable than NLR. This is to the extent that GEP predicts the discharge\ncoefficient with an average relative error of approximately 2.5% in such a\nmanner that the predicted values have less than 5% relative error in the worst\nmodel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jan 2020 00:48:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-10"}

However,\ndue to large number of submissions, the detection whether a picture is\nfabricated or reused is laborious for reviewers, and sometimes is indistinct\nwith human eyes. A tool for detecting similarity between images may help to\nalleviate this problem. Some methods based on local feature points matching\nwork for most of the time, while these methods may result in mess of matchings\ndue to ignorance of global relationship between features. We present a\nframework to detect similar, or perhaps fabricated, pictures with the graph\nmatching techniques. A new iterative method is proposed, and experiments show\nthat such a graph matching technique is better than the methods based only on\nlocal features for some cases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jan 2020 12:29:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-11"}
