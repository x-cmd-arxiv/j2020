However, the link\nbetween consciousness and the material world remains to be explored. We applied\na new logic tool, the non-identity law, to the analysis of the visual dynamics\nrelated to the naturalistic observation of a night-shot still life. We show\nthat visual awareness possesses a postponed, recurrent out-of-body projection\npathway and that the out-of-body projection is superimposed onto the original,\nwhich is reciprocally verified by vision and touch. This suggests that the\nvisual system instinctually not only represents the subjective image\n(brain-generated imagery) but also projects the image back onto the original or\nto a specific place according to the cues of the manipulated afferent messenger\nlight signaling pathway. This finding provides a foundation for understanding\nthe subjectivity and intentionality of consciousness from the perspective of\nvisual awareness and the isomorphic relations between an unknowable original,\nprivate experience, and shareable expression. The result paves the way for\nscientific research on consciousness and facilitates the integration of\nhumanities and natural science.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jan 2020 18:20:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2020 18:55:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 15 Jul 2021 14:35:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-25"}

The rules replace every symbol in a string in parallel with a\nsuccessor to produce the next string, and this procedure iterates. In a\nstochastic context-free L-system (S0L-system), every symbol may have one or\nmore rewriting rule, each with an associated probability of selection. Properly\nconstructed rewriting rules have been found to be useful for modeling and\nsimulating some natural and human engineered processes where each derived\nstring describes a step in the simulation. Typically, processes are modeled by\nexperts who meticulously construct the rules based on measurements or domain\nknowledge of the process. This paper presents an automated approach to finding\nstochastic L-systems, given a set of string sequences as input. The implemented\ntool is called the Plant Model Inference Tool for S0L-systems (PMIT-S0L).\nPMIT-S0L is evaluated using 960 procedurally generated S0L-systems in a test\nsuite, which are each used to generate input strings, and PMIT-S0L is then used\nto infer the system from only the sequences. The evaluation shows that PMIT-S0L\ninfers S0L-systems with up to 9 rewriting rules each in under 12 hours.\nAdditionally, it is found that 3 sequences of strings is sufficient to find the\ncorrect original rewriting rules in 100% of the cases in the test suite, and 6\nsequences of strings reduces the difference in the associated probabilities to\napproximately 1% or less.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jan 2020 16:11:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-30"}

Then, case studies are performed by analyzing performances of\n(1+1) random univariate search and (1+1) evolutionary programming on the sphere\nfunction and the cheating problem. By rigorous theoretical analysis, we\ndemonstrate that both exploitation and exploration of the investigated elitist\nEAs degenerate exponentially with the problem dimension $n$.

A key insight in the construction of these models is\nthat the co-precessing waveform can be effectively mapped to some equivalent\naligned spin waveform. Secondly, the time-dependent rotation implicitly\nintroduces $m$-mode mixing, necessitating an accurate description of\nhigher-order modes in the co-precessing frame. We assess the efficacy of this\nmodelling strategy in the strong field regime using Numerical Relativity\nsimulations. We find that this framework allows for the highly accurate\nconstruction of $(2,\\pm 2)$ modes in our data set, while for higher order\nmodes, especially the $(2,|1|), (3,|2|)$ and $(4,|3|)$ modes, we find rather\nlarge mismatches.

In particular, this space is a\nBoolean algebra. (ii) We give several criteria for a pre-Riesz space to already\nbe a vector lattice.

Specifically, we stack pairs\nof Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) with a typical separation on the sky of $8\nh^{-1}$ Mpc. We stack background galaxy shapes around pairs to obtain mass maps\nthrough weak lensing, and we stack galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey\n(SDSS) to obtain maps of light and stellar mass.

Using LRG pair samples from the BOSS\nsurvey at two different redshifts, we find that the evolution of the mass in\nfilament is consistent with the predictions from perturbation theory.

Furthermore, the Hartree-Fock mixing factors in PBE0r are smaller\nthan in PBE0, which improves the results for (lithium) manganese oxides.

In particular, it is used to study long time behavior such as\nphase-locking where all oscillators rotate at a common frequency with fixed\nangle differences. It has been observed that phase-locking occurs if the\nnatural frequencies of the oscillators are sufficiently close to each other,\nand doesn't if they aren't. Intuitively, the closer the natural frequencies are\nto each other the more stable the system is. In this paper, we study the\nKuramoto model on ring networks with positive coupling between the oscillators\nand derive a criterion for a bifurcation in which two branches of phase-locked\nsolutions collide as we increase the coupling strengths. Furthermore, we state\na criterion for when one of these branches consists of stable phase-locked\nsolutions. In this case stability is lost as the positive coupling is\nincreased. We then apply our criteria to show that for any size of the ring\nnetwork there always exists choices of the natural frequencies and coupling\nstrengths so that this bifurcation occurs. (We require at least five\noscillators for one branch to consist of stable phase-locked solutions.)\nFinally, we conjecture that generically our bifurcation is locally a\nsubcritical bifurcation and globally an $S$-curve. (In the case where one\nbranch consists of phase-locked solutions, an $S$-curve results in bistability\ni.e. the existence of two distinct stable phase-locked solutions.)

This topological state is analogous to the quantum Hall state.\nHowever, contrarily to the exact, extremely precise, and robust quantization of\nthe Hall conductance, the pumped charge is strictly quantized only when the\npumping time is a multiple of a characteristic timescale, i.e., the pumping\ncycle duration. Here, we show instead that the pumped current becomes exactly\nquantized, independently from the pumping time, if the system is led into a\nquasiperiodic, incommensurate regime.

The most\nprecise extraction of $\\alpha_s$ from vector correlators comes from the ratio\nof the charm-quark moments $R_c^{V,2}$ and reads $\\alpha_s(m_Z)=0.1168\\pm\n0.0019$, as we have recently discussed in a companion letter. From bottom\nmoments, using the ratio $R_b^{V,2}$, we find $\\alpha_s(m_Z)=0.1186\\pm0.0048$.\nOur results from the lattice pseudo-scalar charm correlator agree with the\ncentral values of previous determinations, but have larger uncertainties due to\nour more conservative study of the perturbative error. Averaging the results\nobtained from various lattice inputs for the $n=0$ moment we find\n$\\alpha_s(m_Z)=0.1177\\pm0.0020$. Combining experimental and lattice information\non charm correlators into a single fit we obtain $\\alpha_s(m_Z)=0.1170\\pm\n0.0014$, which is the main result of this article.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jan 2020 19:00:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Mar 2020 12:30:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

The leading theory regarding the origin of these patterns is that they\nare due to dust trapping at the edges of gas gaps induced by the gravitational\ntorques from embedded planets. If the concentration of solids at the gap edges\nbecomes high enough, it could potentially result in planetesimal formation by\nthe streaming instability. We test this hypothesis by performing global 1-D\nsimulations of dust evolution and planetesimal formation in a protoplanetary\ndisc that is perturbed by multiple planets. We explore different combinations\nof particle sizes, disc parameters, and planetary masses, and find that\nplanetesimals form in all these cases. We also compare the spatial distribution\nof pebbles from our simulations with protoplanetary disc observations. Planets\nlarger than one pebble isolation mass catch drifting pebbles efficiently at the\nedge of their gas gaps, and depending on the efficiency of planetesimal\nformation at the gap edges, the protoplanetary disc transforms within a few\n100,000 years to either a transition disc with a large inner hole devoid of\ndust or to a disc with narrow bright rings. For simulations with planetary\nmasses lower than the pebble isolation mass, the outcome is a disc with a\nseries of weak ring patterns but no strong depletion between the rings.\nLowering the pebble size artificially to 100 micrometer-sized \"silt\", we find\nthat regions between planets get depleted of their pebble mass on a longer\ntime-scale of up to 0.5 million years. These simulations also produce fewer\nplanetesimals than in the nominal model with millimeter-sized particles and\nalways have at least two rings of pebbles still visible after 1 Myr.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jan 2020 19:00:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-25"}

Thanks to the high visibilities observed,\nwe surpass the 1-bit limit of binary protocols and attain 1.23 bits of\ncertified private randomness per experimental round.

For the case of a 0 degree slant angle on the upper surface the peak\nvalues for drag and negative lift (downforce) coefficient were achieved with a\n30 degrees diffuser angle, where the flow is fully attached with two streamwise\nvortical structures, analogous to results obtained from Ahmed but with the body\nflipped upside down. For diffuser angles above 30 degrees, flow is fully\nseparated from the diffuser. The Ahmed body with 25 degrees slant angle and a\ndiffuser achieves a peak value for downforce at a 20 degrees diffuser angle,\nwhere the flow on the diffuser has two streamwise vortices combined with some\nflow separation. The peak drag value for this case is at 30 degrees diffuser\nangle, where the flow becomes fully separated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jan 2020 20:02:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Sep 2020 17:53:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-30"}

Early investigations of this technology suggest that\nsignificant safety issues remain during control transfers between the\nautomation and human drivers and automation interactions with the\ntransportation system. In order to address these issues, it is critical to\nunderstand both the behavior of human drivers during these events and the\nenvironments where they occur. This article analyzes automated vehicle crash\nnarratives from the California Department of Motor Vehicles automated vehicle\ncrash database to identify safety concerns and gaps between crash types and\ncurrent areas of focus in the current research. The database was analyzed using\nprobabilistic topic modeling of open-ended crash narratives. Topic modeling\nanalysis identified five themes in the database: driver-initiated transition\ncrashes, sideswipe crashes during left-side overtakes, and rear-end collisions\nwhile the vehicle was stopped at an intersection, in a turn lane, and when the\ncrash involved oncoming traffic. Many crashes represented by the\ndriver-initiated transitions topic were also associated with the side-swipe\ncollisions. A substantial portion of the side-swipe collisions also involved\nmotorcycles. These findings highlight previously raised safety concerns with\ntransitions of control and interactions between vehicles in automated mode and\nthe transportation social network. In response to these findings, future\nempirical work should focus on driver-initiated transitions, overtakes, silent\nfailures, complex traffic situations, and adverse driving environments. Beyond\nthis future work, the topic modeling analysis method may be used as a tool to\nmonitor emergent safety issues.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jan 2020 20:53:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-31"}

This is a determinantal point process whose\ncorrelation kernel is expressed in terms of non-Hermitian matrix valued\northogonal polynomials. This model belongs to a class of models for which the\nexisting techniques for studying asymptotics cannot be applied. The novel part\nof our method consists of establishing a connection between matrix valued and\nscalar valued orthogonal polynomials. This allows to simplify the double\ncontour formula for the kernel obtained by Duits and Kuijlaars by reducing the\nsize of a Riemann-Hilbert problem. The proof relies on the fact that the matrix\nvalued weight possesses eigenvalues that live on an underlying Riemann surface\n$\\mathcal{M}$ of genus $0$. We consider this connection of independent\ninterest; it is natural to expect that similar ideas can be used for other\nmatrix valued orthogonal polynomials, as long as the corresponding Riemann\nsurface $\\mathcal{M}$ is of genus $0$.\n  The rest of the method consists of two parts, and mainly follows the lines of\na previous work of Charlier, Duits, Kuijlaars and Lenells.

This limits the practicality of the algorithms,\nas such information is often unknown in advance, or anomalies with different\nlengths might co-exist in the data. To address this limitation, previously, a\nlinear time anomaly detection algorithm based on grammar induction has been\nproposed. While the algorithm can find variable-length patterns, it still\nrequires preselecting values for at least two parameters at the discretization\nstep. How to choose these parameter values properly is still an open problem.\nIn this paper, we introduce a grammar-induction-based anomaly detection method\nutilizing ensemble learning. Instead of using a particular choice of parameter\nvalues for anomaly detection, the method generates the final result based on a\nset of results obtained using different parameter values. We demonstrate that\nthe proposed ensemble approach can outperform existing grammar-induction-based\napproaches with different criteria for selection of parameter values.

At least as important for autonomy, however, is\nthe issue of learning which tasks can be performed in the first place. This is\nparticularly critical in situations where multiple (possibly conflicting) tasks\nand requirements are demanded from the agent, resulting in infeasible\nspecifications. Such situations arise due to over-specification or dynamic\noperating conditions and are only aggravated when the dynamical system model is\nlearned through simulations. Often, these issues are tackled using\nregularization and penalties tuned based on application-specific expert\nknowledge. Nevertheless, this solution becomes impractical for large-scale\nsystems, unknown operating conditions, and/or in online settings where expert\ninput would be needed during the system operation. Instead, this work enables\nagents to autonomously pose, tune, and solve optimal control problems by\ncompromising between performance and specification costs. Leveraging duality\ntheory, it puts forward a counterfactual optimization algorithm that directly\ndetermines the specification trade-off while solving the optimal control\nproblem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jan 2020 22:18:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 May 2020 14:41:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-06"}

The\nfollow-up spectroscopy showed that dwarf galaxies have a sizeable spread in\ntheir metallicities. Several scenarios were suggested to explain the\nmetallicity spread, which can be tested by the structural patterns of stellar\nsubpopulations with distinct metallicities. However, such chemical plus\nstructural examination, to which we refer to as \"chemostructural study\" is\nhindered by the lack of stars with spectroscopic metallicity.

Such a negative radial metallicity gradient\nfor Sextans and CVnI opposes to the traditional spectroscopic results.

The main\ntechnical difficulty with this approach is obtaining bounds on the derivatives\nof the solution to the Poisson equation, also known as Stein factor bounds.

Focusing on the\nrelational aspects, we employ both static depictions and animations to\ncommunicate the travelling of individuals. Our contributions are a novel\nvisualization system that helps investigate the subtle variations of long term\nspatial-temporal relatedness while considering small group patterns. Our\nevaluation with movement ecologists shows that the system gives them quick\naccess to valuable clues in discovering insights into multi-species movements\nand signs of potential interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jan 2020 03:35:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-31"}

However,\nonline social network data often lacks basic demographic information about the\nnodes. Researchers must rely on predicted node attributes to estimate measures\nof homophily, but little is known about the validity of these measures. We show\nthat estimating homophily in a network can be viewed as a dyadic prediction\nproblem, and that homophily estimates are unbiased when dyad-level residuals\nsum to zero in the network. Node-level prediction models, such as the use of\nnames to classify ethnicity or gender, do not generally have this property and\ncan introduce large biases into homophily estimates. Bias occurs due to error\nautocorrelation along dyads. Importantly, node-level classification performance\nis not a reliable indicator of estimation accuracy for homophily. We compare\nestimation strategies that make predictions at the node and dyad levels,\nevaluating performance in different settings. We propose a novel \"ego-alter\"\nmodeling approach that outperforms standard node and dyad classification\nstrategies. While this paper focuses on homophily, results generalize to other\nrelational measures which aggregate predictions along the dyads in a network.\nWe conclude with suggestions for research designs to study homophily in online\nnetworks.

In target fusing, a FuseTracker DNN module refines and fuses targets\nproposed by FlowTracker and frame-wise object detection, instead of trusting\neither of the two inaccurate sources of target proposal. Because FlowTracker\ncan explore complex target-wise motion patterns and FuseTracker can refine and\nfuse targets from FlowTracker and detectors, our approach can achieve the\nstate-of-the-art results on several MOT benchmarks. As an online MOT approach,\nFFT produced the top MOTA of 46.3 on the 2DMOT15, 56.5 on the MOT16, and 56.5\non the MOT17 tracking benchmarks, surpassing all the online and offline methods\nin existing publications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jan 2020 05:17:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-31"}

This method relies on the benefit of unsupervised learning, in the form\nof image reconstruction, for network training. To this end, it puts forward an\nidea of defining a new embedding that allows uniting the main supervised task\nof semantic segmentation and an auxiliary unsupervised task of image\nreconstruction into a single one and proposes to learn this united task by a\nsingle generative model. This embedding generates an output image by\nsuperimposing an input image on its segmentation map. Then, the method learns\nto translate the input image to this embedded output image using a conditional\ngenerative adversarial network, which is known as quite effective for\nimage-to-image translations. This proposal is different than the existing\napproach that uses image reconstruction for the same regularization purpose.\nThe existing approach considers segmentation and image reconstruction as two\nseparate tasks in a multi-task network, defines their losses independently, and\ncombines them in a joint loss function. However, the definition of such a\nfunction requires externally determining right contributions of the supervised\nand unsupervised losses that yield balanced learning between the segmentation\nand image reconstruction tasks. The proposed approach provides an easier\nsolution to this problem by uniting these two tasks into a single one, which\nintrinsically combines their losses. We test our approach on three datasets of\nhistopathological images.

In this work, we disclose a harmful\nsparsifying process called filter collapse, which is common in DNNs with batch\nnormalization (BN) and rectified linear activation functions (e.g. ReLU, Leaky\nReLU). It occurs even without explicit sparsity-inducing regularizations such\nas $L_1$. This phenomenon is caused by the normalization effect of BN, which\ninduces a non-trainable region in the parameter space and reduces the network\ncapacity as a result. This phenomenon becomes more prominent when the network\nis trained with large learning rates (LR) or adaptive LR schedulers, and when\nthe network is finetuned. We analytically prove that the parameters of BN tend\nto become sparser during SGD updates with high gradient noise and that the\nsparsifying probability is proportional to the square of learning rate and\ninversely proportional to the square of the scale parameter of BN. To prevent\nthe undesirable collapsed filters, we propose a simple yet effective approach\nnamed post-shifted BN (psBN), which has the same representation ability as BN\nwhile being able to automatically make BN parameters trainable again as they\nsaturate during training. With psBN, we can recover collapsed filters and\nincrease the model performance in various tasks such as classification on\nCIFAR-10 and object detection on MS-COCO2017.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jan 2020 09:00:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 31 Jan 2020 01:31:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-03"}

Their transfer in gas being a complex process, the\ninterpretation of their observational signatures, either in absorption or in\nemission, is often not straightforward. Numerical radiative transfer\nsimulations are needed to accurately describe the travel of resonant line\nphotons in real and in frequency space, and to produce realistic mock\nobservations. This paper introduces RASCAS, a new public 3D radiative transfer\ncode developed to perform the propagation of any resonant line in numerical\nsimulations of astrophysical objects. RASCAS was designed to be easily\ncustomisable and to process simulations of arbitrarily large sizes on large\nsupercomputers. RASCAS performs radiative transfer on an adaptive mesh with an\noctree structure using the Monte Carlo technique. RASCAS features full MPI\nparallelisation, domain decomposition, adaptive load-balancing, and a standard\npeeling algorithm to construct mock observations. The radiative transport of\nresonant line photons through different mixes of species (e.g. \\ion{H}{i},\n\\ion{Si}{ii}, \\ion{Mg}{ii}, \\ion{Fe}{ii}), including their interaction with\ndust, is implemented in a modular fashion to allow new transitions to be easily\nadded to the code. RASCAS is very accurate and efficient. It shows perfect\nscaling up to a minimum of a thousand cores. It has been fully tested against\nradiative transfer problems with analytic solutions and against various test\ncases proposed in the literature. Although it was designed to describe\naccurately the many scatterings of line photons, RASCAS may also be used to\npropagate photons at any wavelength (e.g. stellar continuum or fluorescent\nlines), or to cast millions of rays to integrate the optical depths of ionising\nphotons, making it highly versatile.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jan 2020 10:59:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-01"}

However,\nthe flight range and communication capacity of aerial BSs are usually limited\ndue to the UAVs' size, weight, and power (SWAP) constraints. To address this\nchallenge, in this paper, we consider dynamic cooperative transmission among\nmultiple aerial BSs for power-efficient aerial communications. Thereby, a\ncentral controller intelligently selects the aerial BSs navigating in the air\nfor cooperation. Consequently, the large virtual array of moving antennas\nformed by the cooperating aerial BSs can be exploited for low-power information\ntransmission and navigation, taking into account the channel conditions, energy\navailability, and user demands. Considering both the fronthauling and the data\ntransmission links, we jointly optimize the trajectories, cooperation\ndecisions, and transmit beamformers of the aerial BSs for minimization of the\nweighted sum of the power consumptions required by all BSs. Since obtaining the\nglobal optimal solution of the formulated problem is difficult, we propose a\nlow-complexity iterative algorithm that can efficiently find a\nKarush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) solution to the problem. Simulation results show that,\ncompared with several baseline schemes, dynamic multi-UAV cooperation can\nsignificantly reduce the communication and navigation powers of the UAVs to\novercome the SWAP limitations, while requiring only a small increase of the\ntransmit power over the fronthauling links.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jan 2020 11:15:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-31"}

Using\ntheory and simulations, in this paper, we validate a more versatile design\nallowing us to fabricate different types of finite-sized aggregates, including\ncolloidal molecules or core-shell clusters, starting from finite density\nsuspensions of isotropic colloids in bulk. In our model, interactions between\nparticles are mediated by DNA linkers with mobile tethering points, as found in\nexperiments using DNA oligomers tagged with hydrophobic complexes immersed into\nsupported bilayers. By fine-tuning the strength and the number of the different\ntypes of linkers, we prove the possibility of controlling the morphology of the\naggregates, in particular, the valency of the molecules and the size of the\ncore-shell clusters. In general, our design shows how multivalent interactions\ncan lead to microphase separation in equilibrium conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jan 2020 12:50:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-31"}

For the DES-SN sample, when considering a 5D ($z$, $x_1$,\n$c$, $\\alpha$, $\\beta$) bias correction, we find evidence of a Hubble residual\n`mass step', where SNe Ia in high mass galaxies ($>10^{10} \\textrm{M}_{\\odot}$)\nare intrinsically more luminous (after correction) than their low mass\ncounterparts by $\\gamma=0.040\\pm0.019$mag.

However,\nthe effects of compositional variation on the lattice dynamics of alloy systems\nare not well understood, due in part to the difficulty of building realistic\nfirst-principles models of structurally-complex solid solutions.

We find that the vibrational internal\nenergy and entropy have a large quantitative impact on the mixing free energy\nand are likely to be particularly important in alloy systems with competing\nphases. The thermodynamically-averaged phonon dispersions and density of states\ncurves show that alloying preserves the structure of the low-frequency bands of\nmodes associated with the Sn sublattice but broadens the high-frequency\nchalcogen bands into a near-continuous spectrum at the 50/50 mixed composition.\nThis results in a general reduction in the phonon mode group velocities and an\nincrease in the number of energy-conserving scattering channels for\nheat-carrying low-frequency modes, which is consistent with the decrease in\nthermal conductivity observed in experimental measurements. Finally, we discuss\nsome of the limitations of our first-principles modelling approach and propose\nmethods to address these in future studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jan 2020 13:47:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-31"}

It is a pertinent question\nif this variability is purely random or to some extent predictable. Here we\nshow, by employing machine learning techniques such as regression neural\nnetworks and support vector machines that deformation predictability evolves\nwith strain and crystal size. Using data from discrete dislocations dynamics\nsimulations, the machine learning models are trained to infer the mapping from\nfeatures of the pre-existing dislocation configuration to the stress-strain\ncurves. The predictability vs strain relation is non-monotonic and exhibits a\nsystem size effect: larger systems are more predictable. Stochastic deformation\navalanches give rise to fundamental limits of deformation predictability for\nintermediate strains. However, the large-strain deformation dynamics of the\nsamples can be predicted surprisingly well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jan 2020 13:59:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-31"}

However, as the\ncantilever oscillates with an amplitude A that is usually on the order of\natomic dimensions or even larger, blurring occurs. To extract a force versus\ndistance curve from an experimental frequency versus distance spectrum, a\ndeconvolution algorithm to recover the force from the experimental frequency\nshift is required. It has been recently shown that this deconvolution can be an\nill-posed inversion problem causing false force-distance curves. Whether an\ninversion problem is well- or ill-posed is determined by two factors: the shape\nof the force-distance curve and the oscillation amplitude used for the\nmeasurement. A proper choice of the oscillation amplitude as proposed by the in\nection point test of Sader et al. [Nat. Nanotechnol. 13, 1088 (2018)] should\navoid ill-posedness.

This study evaluates the performance of WRF in\ndepicting the 21-23 December 2013 New England ice storm at the surface and in\nvertical profile. A series of sensitivity tests are run using eight planetary\nboundary layer (PBL) physics parameterizations, three reanalysis datasets, two\nvertical level configurations, and with and without grid nudging.

As result, the interaction potential is\nrepresented in a parametric low-rank canonical format in $O(d L n)$ complexity.\nThe energy is then calculated in $O(d L)$ operations. Electrostatics in large\nbiomolecules is modeled by using the novel range-separated (RS) tensor format\n[2], which maintains the long-range part of the 3D collective potential of the\nmany-body system represented on $n\\times n \\times n$ grid in a parametric\nlow-rank form in $O(n)$-complexity. We show that the force field can be easily\nrecovered by using the already precomputed electric field in the low-rank RS\nformat. The RS tensor representation of the discretized Dirac delta [45]\nenables the efficient energy preserving regularization scheme for solving the\n3D elliptic PDEs with strongly singular right-hand side arising in\nbio-sciences. We conclude that the rank-structured tensor-based approximation\ntechniques provide the promising numerical tools for applications to many-body\ndynamics, protein docking and classification problems and for low-parametric\ninterpolation of scattered data in data science.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jan 2020 15:24:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-21"}

Several life events were analysed,\nsuch as getting married, buying a new car, child birth, home relocation and\ndivorce, together with the socio-demographic attributes for survival modelling,\nsome of which are age, nationality, number of children, number of cars and home\nownership.

We measure a systemic velocity of $180.0\\pm1.3$ km/s,\nconsistently across the various datasets analyzed, and find that a\ndispersion-only model is moderately favored over models accounting also for\ninternal rotation. Our best estimate of the internal velocity dispersion is\n$6.2_{-1.3}^{+1.6}$ km/s, much smaller than the values reported in the\nliterature and in line with similarly luminous dSphs; this is consistent with\nTucana not being an exception to the too-big-to-fail problem, nor living in a\ndark matter halo much more massive than those of its siblings. As for the\nmetallicity properties, we do not find anything unusual; there are hints of the\npresence of a [Fe/H] gradient but more data are needed to pin its presence\ndown.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jan 2020 15:43:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-01"}

NMR spectroscopy signals, however, are usually corrupted\nby Gaussian noise in practice, raising difficulties in sequential analysis and\nquantification of the signals. The low-rank Hankel property plays an important\nrole in the denoising issue, but selecting an appropriate parameter still\nremains a problem. In this work, we explore the effect of the regularization\nparameter of a convex optimization denoising method based on low-rank Hankel\nmatrices for exponential signals corrupted by Gaussian noise. An accurate\nestimate on the spectral norm of weighted Hankel matrices is provided as a\nguidance to set the regularization parameter.

Currently, there are hundreds of RNG\nstatistical tests that are often combined into so-called batteries, each\ncontaining from a dozen to more than one hundred tests.\n  When a battery test is used, it is applied to a sequence generated by the\nRNG, and the calculation time is determined by the length of the sequence and\nthe number of tests. Generally speaking, the longer the sequence, the smaller\ndeviations from randomness can be found by a specific test. So, when a battery\nis applied, on the one hand, the \"better\" tests are in the battery, the more\nchances to reject a \"bad\" RNG. On the other hand, the larger the battery, the\nless time can be spent on each test and, therefore, the shorter the test\nsequence. In turn, this reduces the ability to find small deviations from\nrandomness. To reduce this trade-off, we propose an adaptive way to use\nbatteries (and other sets) of tests, which requires less time but, in a certain\nsense, preserves the power of the original battery.

A recently proposed\nabstraction method uses deep learning to replace this CTMC with a discrete-time\ncontinuous-space process, by training a mixture density deep neural network\nwith traces sampled at regular time intervals (which can obtained either by\nsimulating a given CRN or as time-series data from experiment). The major\nadvantage of such abstraction is that it produces a computational model that is\ndramatically cheaper to execute, while preserving the statistical features of\nthe training data.

It thereby gives rise to\ndriving forces on the dynamics of interaction between the constituent\nphenomena. In mechano-chemically interacting materials systems, even\nconsideration of only compositions, order parameters and strains can render the\nfree energy to be reasonably high-dimensional. In proposing the free energy as\na paradigm for scale bridging, we have previously exploited neural networks for\ntheir representation of such high-dimensional functions. Specifically, we have\ndeveloped an integrable deep neural network (IDNN) that can be trained to free\nenergy derivative data obtained from atomic scale models and statistical\nmechanics, then analytically integrated to recover a free energy density\nfunction. The motivation comes from the statistical mechanics formalism, in\nwhich certain free energy derivatives are accessible for control of the system,\nrather than the free energy itself. Our current work combines the IDNN with an\nactive learning workflow to improve sampling of the free energy derivative data\nin a high-dimensional input space. Treated as input-output maps, machine\nlearning accommodates role reversals between independent and dependent\nquantities as the mathematical descriptions change with scale bridging. As a\nprototypical system we focus on Ni-Al. Phase field simulations using the\nresulting IDNN representation for the free energy density of Ni-Al demonstrate\nthat the appropriate physics of the material have been learned.

In\nparallel, Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems are being applied to sensitive\nfields such as healthcare, justice, or human resources, raising multiple\nconcerns on the trustworthiness of such systems. Trust in AI systems is thus\nintrinsically linked to ethics, including the ethics of algorithms, the ethics\nof data, or the ethics of practice. In this paper, we formalise the\nrequirements of trustworthy AI systems through an ethics perspective. We\nspecifically focus on the aspects that can be integrated into the design and\ndevelopment of AI systems. After discussing the state of research and the\nremaining challenges, we show how a concrete use-case in smart cities can\nbenefit from these methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jan 2020 08:09:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-14"}

The potential for the motion of\n(H$^{+}$) from one side of the ring to the other through the center of the ring\nis found to be a symmetric double well and such complexes are suggested as\nmolecular rattles which can exhibit a ring umbrella like inversion. Our study\nreveals C$_{2}$H$_{2}$P$_{3}^{-}$ - H$^{+}$ to be a molecular rattle with a\nbarrier height of 44.277 kcal mol$^{-1}$ and exciting it to the third\nvibrational level makes easy for the proton to go through the ring.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jan 2020 11:17:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-25"}
