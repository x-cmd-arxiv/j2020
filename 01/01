Moreover, this pool is diverse with\nrespect to the levels of professional security and types of academic\ninstitutions represented. Letter B does not comment on diversity, but rather,\nasks for discussion and debate. This letter was signed by a strong majority of\nindividuals inferred to be white men in professionally secure positions at\nhighly research intensive universities. Letter C speaks out specifically\nagainst diversity statements, calling them \"a mistake,\" and claiming that their\nusage during early stages of faculty hiring \"diminishes mathematical\nachievement.\" Individuals who signed both Letters B and C, that is, signatories\nwho both privilege debate and oppose diversity statements, are overwhelmingly\ninferred to be tenured white men at highly research intensive universities.

To achieve this goal, we derive our focus and\norganization from two perspectives. The first perspective is that, although\nmechanisms for network security are extremely diverse, they are all instances\nof a few patterns. Consequently, after a pragmatic classification of security\nattacks, the main sections of the tutorial cover the four patterns for\nproviding network security, of which the familiar three are cryptographic\nprotocols, packet filtering, and dynamic resource allocation. Although\ncryptographic protocols hide the data contents of packets, they cannot hide\npacket headers. When users need to hide packet headers from adversaries, which\nmay include the network from which they are receiving service, they must resort\nto the pattern of compound sessions and overlays. The second perspective comes\nfrom the observation that security mechanisms interact in important ways, with\neach other and with other aspects of networking, so each pattern includes a\ndiscussion of its interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Dec 2019 16:00:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 6 Jun 2020 16:11:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-09"}

System sizes can range\nfrom few to thousands or, in some examples, millions of atoms. Different\ndiscretization schemes (basis sets) and different system geometries (finite\nnon-periodic vs. infinite periodic boundary conditions) yield matrices with\ndifferent structures. The ELectronic Structure Infrastructure (ELSI) project\nprovides an open-source software interface to facilitate the implementation and\noptimal use of high-performance solver libraries covering cubic scaling\neigensolvers, linear scaling density-matrix-based algorithms, and other reduced\nscaling methods in between. In this paper, we present recent improvements and\ndevelopments inside ELSI, mainly covering (1) new solvers connected to the\ninterface, (2) matrix layout and communication adapted for parallel\ncalculations of periodic and/or spin-polarized systems, (3) routines for\ndensity matrix extrapolation in geometry optimization and molecular dynamics\ncalculations, and (4) general utilities such as parallel matrix I/O and JSON\noutput. The ELSI interface has been integrated into four electronic structure\ncode projects (DFTB+, DGDFT, FHI-aims, SIESTA), allowing us to rigorously\nbenchmark the performance of the solvers on an equal footing. Based on results\nof a systematic set of large-scale benchmarks performed with Kohn-Sham\ndensity-functional theory and density-functional tight-binding theory, we\nidentify factors that strongly affect the efficiency of the solvers, and\npropose a decision layer that assists with the solver selection process.\nFinally, we describe a reverse communication interface encoding matrix-free\niterative solver strategies that are amenable, e.g., for use with planewave\nbasis sets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Dec 2019 16:41:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Jun 2020 17:40:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 5 Jul 2020 00:14:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-07"}

In particular, the option-critic\narchitecture provides general purpose policy gradient theorems for learning\nactions from scratch that are extended in time. However, past work makes the\nkey assumption that each of the components of option-critic has independent\nparameters. In this work we note that while this key assumption of the policy\ngradient theorems of option-critic holds in the tabular case, it is always\nviolated in practice for the deep function approximation setting. We thus\nreconsider this assumption and consider more general extensions of\noption-critic and hierarchical option-critic training that optimize for the\nfull architecture with each update. It turns out that not assuming parameter\nindependence challenges a belief in prior work that training the policy over\noptions can be disentangled from the dynamics of the underlying options. In\nfact, learning can be sped up by focusing the policy over options on states\nwhere options are actually likely to terminate. We put our new algorithms to\nthe test in application to sample efficient learning of Atari games, and\ndemonstrate significantly improved stability and faster convergence when\nlearning long options.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Dec 2019 16:49:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Feb 2020 06:19:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-07"}

Characterizing each word type by two random variables, length\n(in number of characters) and absolute frequency, we show that the\ncorresponding bivariate joint probability distribution shows a rich and precise\nphenomenology, with the type-length and the type-frequency distributions as its\ntwo marginals, and the conditional distribution of frequency at fixed length\nproviding a clear formulation for the brevity-frequency phenomenon. The\ntype-length distribution turns out to be well fitted by a gamma distribution\n(much better than with the previously proposed lognormal), and the conditional\nfrequency distributions at fixed length display power-law-decay behavior with a\nfixed exponent $\\alpha\\simeq 1.4$ and a characteristic-frequency crossover that\nscales as an inverse power $\\delta\\simeq 2.8$ of length, which implies the\nfulfilment of a scaling law analogous to those found in the thermodynamics of\ncritical phenomena.

From this, one may be\ntempted to conclude that descent algorithms which escape saddle points will\nreach a good local minimum. However, basic optimization theory tell us that it\nis also possible for a descent algorithm to diverge to infinity if there are\npaths leading to infinity, along which the loss function decreases. It is not\nclear whether for non-linear neural networks there exists one setting that no\nbad local-min and no decreasing paths to infinity can be simultaneously\nachieved. In this paper, we give the first positive answer to this question.\nMore specifically, for a large class of over-parameterized deep neural networks\nwith appropriate regularizers, the loss function has no bad local minima and no\ndecreasing paths to infinity. The key mathematical trick is to show that the\nset of regularizers which may be undesirable can be viewed as the image of a\nLipschitz continuous mapping from a lower-dimensional Euclidean space to a\nhigher-dimensional Euclidean space, and thus has zero measure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Dec 2019 18:17:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-01"}

These theories propose key\nfundamental mechanisms to explain consciousness, but they only partially\nconnect such mechanisms to the possible functional and adaptive role of\nconsciousness. Recently, some cognitive and neuroscientific models try to solve\nthis gap by linking consciousness to various aspects of goal-directed\nbehaviour, the pivotal cognitive process that allows mammals to flexibly act in\nchallenging environments. Here we propose the Representation\nInternal-Manipulation (RIM) theory of consciousness, a theory that links the\nmain elements of consciousness theories to components and functions of\ngoal-directed behaviour, ascribing a central role for consciousness to the\ngoal-directed manipulation of internal representations. This manipulation\nrelies on four specific computational operations to perform the flexible\ninternal adaptation of all key elements of goal-directed computation, from the\nrepresentations of objects to those of goals, actions, and plans. Finally, we\npropose the concept of `manipulation agency' relating the sense of agency to\nthe internal manipulation of representations. This allows us to propose that\nthe subjective experience of consciousness is associated to the human capacity\nto generate and control a simulated internal reality that is vividly perceived\nand felt through the same perceptual and emotional mechanisms used to tackle\nthe external world.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Dec 2019 18:45:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2022 14:37:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-06"}

In fact, any $G$-symmetric system can be viewed as a boundary of\n$G$-gauge theory in one higher dimension. The conservation of gauge charge and\ngauge flux in the bulk $G$-gauge theory gives rise to the symmetry and the dual\nsymmetry respectively. So any $G$-symmetric system actually has a larger\nsymmetry called categorical symmetry, which is a combination of the symmetry\nand the dual symmetry. However, part (and only part) of the categorical\nsymmetry must be spontaneously broken in any gapped phase of the system, but\nthere exists a gapless state where the categorical symmetry is not\nspontaneously broken. Such a gapless state corresponds to the usual critical\npoint of Landau symmetry breaking transition.

In this work, we systematically study the so-called three-loop\nbraiding statistics for loop-like excitations for 3D fermionic topological\nphases.

In order to respect the\navailable data on the kaon modes $K\\to\\pi\\nu\\bar\\nu$ and increase the rates of\nthe hyperon decays substantially at the same time, two different scalar LQs are\nneeded. If the LQs have Yukawa couplings solely to SM fermions, we find that\nthe hyperon rates cannot attain values within the reach of ongoing or\nnear-future experiments because of the combined constraints from the\nmeasurements on kaon mixing and lepton-flavor-violating processes. However, if\nwe include light right-handed neutrinos in the LQ interactions, their\ncontributions can evade the leading restrictions and translate into hyperon\nrates which may be big enough to be probed by upcoming searches.

We prove that this is not the case by exhibiting a shallow\ncircuit family with uniformly random gates that cannot be efficiently\nclassically simulated near-exactly under standard hardness assumptions, but can\nbe simulated approximately for all but a superpolynomially small fraction of\ncircuit instances in time linear in the number of qubits and gates.

By using X-ray microscopic imaging,\nsmall-angle X-ray scattering, and differential scanning calorimetry, we were\nable to characterize the interactions of chitosan and starch in the mesoscale\ncomposites. The morphology of the composite is far more complex from the simple\nmixture of starch granules with a nominal size of a few micrometers and\nchitosan microbundles of tens and hundreds of micrometers. This unique\nmorphology can only be explained by the enhanced miscibility of chitosan in a\nstarch granular matrix. It is evidenced that there is a possible ionic\ninteraction between the amino group in chitosan and the hydroxyl groups in\nstarch granules. Despite the limited solubility of chitosan in water, this\nionic interaction allows for the disassembly of chitosan microbundles within\nthe starch suspension. The result is a chemically stronger and more stable\ngranular composite formed by two biocompatible and biodegradable polysaccharide\npolymers. The mechanism of chitosan to disperse throughout starch granules has\nimplications for the application of chitosan in water and other solvents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Dec 2019 19:07:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-03"}

We then investigate\nhow the compressed representation provided by the truncated tensor-SVD is\nrelated both theoretically and in compression performance to its closest\ntensor-based analogue, truncated HOSVD (De Lathauwer et al., 2000; De Lathauwer\nand Vandewalle, 2004), thereby showing the potential advantages of our\ntensor-based algorithms.

Recent discoveries of low\nmass, large radii objects (\"super-puffs\") have challenged theories of planet\nformation and atmospheric loss, as their high inferred gas masses make them\nvulnerable to runaway accretion and hydrodynamic escape. Here we propose that\nhigh altitude photochemical hazes could enhance the observed radii of low-mass\nplanets and explain the nature of super-puffs. We construct model atmospheres\nin radiative-convective equilibrium and compute rates of atmospheric escape and\nhaze distributions, taking into account haze coagulation, sedimentation,\ndiffusion, and advection by an outflow wind. We develop mass-radius diagrams\nthat include atmospheric lifetimes and haze opacity, which is enhanced by the\noutflow, such that young (~0.1-1 Gyr), warm (T$_{eq}$ $\\geq$ 500 K), low mass\nobjects ($M_c$ < 4M$_{\\rm Earth}$) should experience the most apparent radius\nenhancement due to hazes, reaching factors of three. This reconciles the\ndensities and ages of the most extreme super-puffs. For Kepler-51b, the\ninclusion of hazes reduces its inferred gas mass fraction to <10%, similar to\nthat of planets on the large radius side of the sub-Neptune radius gap. This\nsuggests that Kepler-51b may be evolving towards that population, and that some\nwarm sub-Neptunes may have evolved from super-puffs. Hazes also render\ntransmission spectra of super-puffs and sub-Neptunes featureless, consistent\nwith recent measurements. Our hypothesis can be tested by future observations\nof super-puffs' transmission spectra at mid-infrared wavelengths, where we\npredict that the planet radius will be half of that observed in the\nnear-infrared.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Dec 2019 19:52:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 1 Feb 2020 04:36:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-26"}

However, some issues still need to be addressed when using the\nRNN-based inversion model. First, with limited number of parameters in RNN, it\ncannot model the low-frequency dynamics accurately, thus an extra linear model\nhas been used, which can become an interference for tracking control at high\nfrequencies. Moreover, the control speed and the RNN modeling accuracy cannot\nbe improved simultaneously as the control sampling speed is restricted by the\nlength of the RNN training set. Therefore, this article focuses on addressing\nthese limitations of RNN-based inversion model control. Specifically, a novel\nmodeling method is proposed to incorporate the linear model in a way that it\ndoes not affect the existing high-frequency control performance achieved by\nRNN. Additionally, an interpolation method is proposed to double the sampling\nfrequency (compared to the RNN training sampling frequency). Analysis on the\nstability issues which may arise when the proposed new model is used for\npredictive control is presented along with the instructions on determining the\nparameters for ensuring the closed-loop stability. Finally, the proposed\napproach is demonstrated on a commercial piezo actuator, and the experiment\nresults show that the tracking performances can be significantly improved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Dec 2019 19:57:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-03"}

A bidirected graph is a graph in which each\nend of each edge has a sign $+$ or $-$. Bidirected graphs are a common\ngeneralization of digraphs and signed graphs. We define a new concept of\nradials as a generalization of a classical concept in matching theory, critical\ngraphs. Radials are also a generalization of a class of digraphs known as\nflowgraphs. We also define semiradials, which are a relaxed concept of radials.\nWe further define special classes of radials and semiradials, that is, absolute\nsemiradials, strong and almost strong radials, linear semiradials, and\nsublinear radials. We provide constructive characterizations for these five\nclasses of bidirected graphs. Our serial papers are a part of a series of works\nthat establish the strong component decomposition for bidirected graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Dec 2019 21:15:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-03"}

In\nparticular, this allows us to apply our results to (effective) Quantum General\nRelativity, possibly coupled to matter from the Standard Model, as was\nsuggested by Kreimer (2008). To this end, we introduce different gradings on\nthe renormalization Hopf algebra and study combinatorial properties of the\nsuperficial degree of divergence. Then we generalize known coproduct and\nantipode identities to the super- and non-renormalizable cases and to theories\nwith multiple vertex residues. Building upon our main result, we provide\ncriteria for the compatibility of these Hopf ideals with the corresponding\nrenormalized Feynman rules. A direct consequence of our findings is the\nwell-definedness of the Corolla polynomial for Quantum Yang--Mills theory\nwithout reference to a particular renormalization scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 31 Dec 2019 22:50:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 18 Apr 2021 21:50:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 15 May 2022 21:50:53 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 31 Jul 2022 21:20:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-07"}

Similarly, if the agent receives also rewards that\ncreate suboptimal modes of the objective function, it will likely prematurely\nstop exploring. More recent methods add auxiliary intrinsic rewards to\nencourage exploration. However, auxiliary rewards lead to a non-stationary\ntarget for the Q-function.

With the\nhigher accuracy enabled by fine-grained pruning patterns, the unique insight is\nto use the compiler to re-gain and guarantee high hardware efficiency. In other\nwords, our method achieves the best of both worlds, and is desirable across\ntheory/algorithm, compiler, and hardware levels. The proposed PatDNN is an\nend-to-end framework to efficiently execute DNN on mobile devices with the help\nof a novel model compression technique (pattern-based pruning based on extended\nADMM solution framework) and a set of thorough architecture-aware compiler- and\ncode generation-based optimizations (filter kernel reordering, compressed\nweight storage, register load redundancy elimination, and parameter\nauto-tuning). Evaluation results demonstrate that PatDNN outperforms three\nstate-of-the-art end-to-end DNN frameworks, TensorFlow Lite, TVM, and Alibaba\nMobile Neural Network with speedup up to 44.5x, 11.4x, and 7.1x, respectively,\nwith no accuracy compromise. Real-time inference of representative large-scale\nDNNs (e.g., VGG-16, ResNet-50) can be achieved using mobile devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jan 2020 04:52:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Jan 2020 00:27:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 17 Jan 2020 04:32:38 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 22 Jan 2020 04:13:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-23"}

First, a smooth supporting contour under the wrinkled\nforehead was generated via b-spline interpolation and extrapolation to\nconstrain the deformation of the wrinkled zone.

Recent experiments have shown that when the discriminator is\nprovided with domain information in both domains and label information in the\nsource domain, it is able to preserve the complex multimodal information and\nhigh semantic information in both domains. Following this idea, we adopt a\ndiscriminator with $2K$-dimensional output to perform both domain-level and\nclass-level alignments simultaneously in a single discriminator.

We demonstrate that in comparison with a\ntraditional random forest-based approach (precision:0.24, recall:0.58, f1:0.34,\nauPRC:0.44) and a single task CNN (precision:0.59, recall:0.69, f1:0.64,\nauPRC:0.68) our architecture using unsupervised transfer learning through\nconvolutional denoising autoencoders dramatically improves the performance of\nAF detection in participants at rest (pr:0.94, rc:0.98, f1:0.96, auPRC:0.96).\nIn addition, we validate algorithm performance on a prospectively derived\nreplication cohort of ambulatory subjects using data derived from an\nindependently engineered device. We show that two-stage training can help\naddress the unbalanced data problem common to biomedical applications where\nlarge well-annotated datasets are scarce. In conclusion, though a combination\nof simulation and transfer learning and we develop and apply a multitask\narchitecture to the problem of AF detection from wearable wrist sensors\ndemonstrating high levels of accuracy and a solution for the vexing challenge\nof mechanical noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jan 2020 07:41:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 25 Jan 2020 05:02:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-28"}

Existing methods are mainly based on the integration of multiple\nneural networks, and most of them use the Gaussian heat map to locate the\nvertebrae's centroid. However, the process of obtaining the vertebrae's\ncentroid coordinates using heat maps is non-differentiable, so it is impossible\nto train the network to label the vertebrae directly. Therefore, for end-to-end\ndifferential training of vertebra coordinates on CT scans, a robust and\naccurate automatic vertebral labeling algorithm is proposed in this study.\nFirstly, a novel residual-based multi-label classification and localization\nnetwork is developed, which can capture multi-scale features, but also utilize\nthe residual module and skip connection to fuse the multi-level features.\nSecondly, to solve the problem that the process of finding coordinates is\nnon-differentiable and the spatial structure is not destructible, integral\nregression module is used in the localization network. It combines the\nadvantages of heat map representation and direct regression coordinates to\nachieve end-to-end training, and can be compatible with any key point detection\nmethods of medical image based on heat map.

To make cellular MIoT\na reality, data transfer and control procedures specifically designed for the\nsupport of IoT are needed. For this reason, 3GPP has introduced the Control\nPlane Cellular IoT optimization, which foresees a simplified bearer\ninstantiation, with the Mobility Management Entity (MME) handling both control\nand data traffic. The performance of the MME has therefore become critical, and\nproperly scaling its computational capability can determine the ability of the\nwhole network to tackle MIoT effectively. In particular, considering\nvirtualized networks and the need for an efficient allocation of computing\nresources, it is paramount to characterize the MME performance as the MIoT\ntraffic load changes. We address this need by presenting compact, closed-form\nexpressions linking the number of IoT sources with the rate at which bearers\nare requested, and such a rate with the delay incurred by the IoT data. We show\nthat our analysis, supported by testbed experiments and verified through\nlarge-scale simulations, represents a valuable tool to make effective scaling\ndecisions in virtualized cellular core networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jan 2020 10:14:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-03"}

This assumption seems\nimplausible given finite and scarce resources in the brain. Quantization is an\ninformation encoding process whereby a continuous quantity is systematically\ndivided into a finite number of possible categories. Rounding is a simple\nexample of quantization. We apply this information theoretic concept to develop\na novel quantized (i.e., discrete) probability distortion function. We develop\nthree conjunction probability gambling tasks to look for evidence of quantized\nprobability representations in the brain. We hypothesize that certain ranges of\nprobability will be lumped together in the same indifferent category if a\nquantized representation exists. For example, two distinct probabilities such\nas 0.57 and 0.585 may be treated indifferently. Our extensive data analysis has\nfound strong evidence to support such a quantized representation: 59/76\nparticipants (i.e., 78%) demonstrated a best fit to 4-bit quantized models\ninstead of continuous models. This observation is the major development and\nnovelty of the present work. The brain is very likely to be employing a\nquantized representation of probability. This discovery demonstrates a major\nprecision limitation of the brain's representational and decision-making\nability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jan 2020 11:45:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-07"}

We describe a simple\n$(1+\\epsilon)$-approximation algorithm that is faster and does not need FFT.\nCombining our approach with additional ideas leads to numerous new results:\n  - We obtain the first linear-time approximation algorithm; the running time\nis $O(\\epsilon^{-2}n)$.\n  - We obtain a faster exact algorithm computing all Hamming distances up to a\ngiven threshold k; its running time improves previous results by logarithmic\nfactors and is linear if $k\\le\\sqrt m$.\n  - We obtain approximation algorithms with better $\\epsilon$-dependence using\nrectangular matrix multiplication.

In this work, we follow the same strategy to study the case of\nacetaldehyde (CH3CHO). Method: To this end, we used the data obtained with the\nIRAM-NOEMA interferometer in the framework of the Large Program SOLIS to image\nthe B0 and B1 shocks along the L1157 blueshifted outflow in methanol (CH3OH)\nand acetaldehyde line emission. Results: We imaged six CH3OH and eight CH3CHO\nlines which cover upper level energies up to 30 K. Both species trace the B0\nmolecular cavity as well as the northern B1 portion, i.e. the regions where the\nyoungest shocks (1000 yr) occurred. The CH$_3$OH and CH$_3$CHO emission peaks\ntowards the B1b clump, where we measured the following column densities and\nrelative abundances: 1.3 x 10^16 cm-2 and 6.5 x 10-6 (methanol), and 7 x 10^13\ncm-2 and 3.5 x 10-8 (acetaldehyde). We carried out a non-LTE LVG analysis of\nthe observed CH3OH line: the average kinetic temperature and density of the\nemitting gas are Tkin = 90 K and nH2 = 4 x 10^5 cm-3, respectively. The CH3OH\nand CH3CHO abundance ratio towards B1b is 190, varying by less than a factor 3\nthroughout the whole B0-B1 structure. Conclusions: The comparison of\nastrochemical model predictions with the observed methanol and acetaldehyde\nspatial distribution does not allow to distinguish whether acetaldehyde is\nformed on the grain mantles or rather on the gas-phase, as its gas-phase\nformation, dominated by the reaction of ethyl radical (CH3CH2) with atomic\noxygen, is very fast. Observations of acetaldehyde in younger shocks, e.g. 10^2\nyr old, or/and of the ethyl radical, whose frequencies are not presently\navailable, are necessary to settle the issue.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jan 2020 15:02:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-11"}

The ability to rapidly compute the\nmacroscopic behavior based on these detailed microstructures is of paramount\nimportance for accelerating material discovery and design. Here, our focus is\non the macroscopic, nonlinear elastic response of materials harboring\nmicrostructure. Because of the diversity of microstructural patterns that can\nform, there is interest in taking a purely computational approach to predicting\ntheir macroscopic response.

In order to seek out an answer to this unsettled\nissue, a number of mechanisms have been offered over time, but it still remains\na great challenge to date. In this paper, based on the hydrothermal vent theory\nfor the origins of life, I tentatively put forward a new hypothesis that the\nprebiotic emergence of the uniform chirality of biomolecules might have been\nspecifically determined by the spin state of electrons during their prebiotic\nsyntheses on the surfaces of greigite, a mineral which has been frequently\nargued to have played an important role in the evolutionary context of life. An\nexperimental model to test the hypothesis has also been proposed. Taken into\nconsideration the possible widespread existence of greigite in submarine\nhydrothermal vent systems which have been frequently argued as a potential\ncradle for the origins of life, the suggested model, if could be experimentally\ndemonstrated, may be suggestive of where and how life originated on early\nEarth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jan 2020 04:39:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-13"}

The spikes develop a high pull to weight\nratio and promise good mobility in soft, rocky and steep terrain,\nenergy-efficient operation, and their design is relatively simple. By\npenetrating the ground at regular intervals, the spikes also enable the in-situ\nmeasurement of a variety of ground properties, including penetration\nresistance, temperature, and pH. Here we present a concept for a light lunar\nbulldozer with interlocking spikes that uses a blade and a ripper to loosen and\nmove soil over short distances, that maps ground properties in situ and that\nuses this information to construct landing pads and blast walls, and to\notherwise interact with the ground in a targeted and efficient manner.

Domestic dogs have descended from pack-living gray wolf-like\nancestors. Unlike their group living ancestors, free-ranging dogs are\nfacultatively social, preferring to forage solitarily. They are scavengers by\nnature, mostly dependent on human garbage and generosity for their sustenance.\nFree-ranging dogs are highly territorial, often defending their territories\nusing vocalizations. Vocal communication plays a critical role between inter\nand intraspecies and group interaction and maintaining their social dynamics.\nBarking is the most common among the different types of vocalizations of dogs.\nDogs have a broad hearing range and can respond to sounds over long distances.\nDomestic dogs have been shown to have the ability to distinguish between\nbarking in different contexts. Since free-ranging dogs regularly engage in\nvarious kinds of interactions with each other, it is interesting to know\nwhether they are capable of distinguishing between vocalizations of their own\nand other groups. In this study, a playback experiment was used to test if dogs\ncan distinguish between barking of their own group member from a non-group\nmember. Though dogs respond to barking from other groups in territorial\nexchanges, they did not respond differently to the self and other group barking\nin the playback experiments. This suggests a role of context in the\ninteractions between dogs and opens up possibilities for future studies on the\ncomparison of the responses of dogs in playback experiments with their natural\nbehavior through long-term observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jan 2020 07:20:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-20"}

In this study, the authors propose a\ndeep-learning architecture called Conv-GCN that combines a graph convolutional\nnetwork (GCN) and a three-dimensional (3D) convolutional neural network (3D\nCNN). First, they introduce a multi-graph GCN to deal with three inflow and\noutflow patterns (recent, daily, and weekly) separately. Multi-graph GCN\nnetworks can capture spatiotemporal correlations and topological information\nwithin the entire network. A 3D CNN is then applied to deeply integrate the\ninflow and outflow information. High-level spatiotemporal features between\ndifferent inflow and outflow patterns and between stations that are nearby and\nfar away can be extracted by 3D CNN.
