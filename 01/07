So far, most of existing FTJs have been based on perovskite-oxide\nbarrier layers. The recent discovery of the two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals\nferroelectric materials opens a new route to realize tunnel junctions with new\nfunctionalities and nm-scale dimensions. Due to the weak coupling between the\natomic layers in these materials, the relative dipole alignment between them\ncan be controlled by applied voltage. This allows transitions between\nferroelectric and antiferroelectric orderings, resulting in significant changes\nof the electronic structure. Here, we propose to realize 2D antiferroelectric\ntunnel junctions (AFTJs), which exploit this new functionality, based on\nbilayer In$_2$X$_3$ (X = S, Se, Te) barriers and different 2D electrodes. Using\nfirst-principles density functional theory calculations, we demonstrate that\nthe In$_2$X$_3$ bilayers exhibit stable ferroelectric and antiferroelectric\nstates separated by sizable energy barriers, thus supporting a non-volatile\nswitching between these states. Using quantum-mechanical modeling of the\nelectronic transport, we explore in-plane and out-of-plane tunneling across the\nIn$_2$S$_3$ van der Waals bilayers, and predict giant tunneling\nelectroresistance (TER) effects and multiple non-volatile resistance states\ndriven by ferroelectric-antiferroelectric order transitions. Our proposal opens\na new route to realize nanoscale memory devices with ultrahigh storage density\nusing 2D AFTJs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jan 2020 16:05:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Jan 2020 03:35:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 8 Jan 2021 21:30:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-09"}

In such a system, during\nthe downlink phase, the sensors harvest radio-frequency (RF) energy emitted by\nthe distributed access points (APs). During the uplink phase, sensors transmit\ndata to the APs using the harvested energy. Collocated massive MIMO and\nsmall-cell IoT can be treated as special cases of cell-free IoT. We derive the\ntight closed-form lower bound on the amount of harvested energy, and the\nclosed-form expression of SINR as the metrics of power transfer and data\ntransmission, respectively. To improve the energy efficiency, we jointly\noptimize the uplink and downlink power control coefficients to minimize the\ntotal transmit energy consumption while meeting the target SINRs. Extended\nsimulation results show that cell-free IoT outperforms collocated massive MIMO\nand small-cell IoT both in terms of the per user throughput for uplink, and the\namount of energy harvested for downlink. Moreover, significant gains can be\nachieved by the proposed joint power control in terms of both per user\nthroughput and energy consumption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jan 2020 16:07:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-07"}

The data\nfrom M87 collected between 2012 and 2015 as part of a MAGIC monitoring\nprogramme are analysed and combined with multi-wavelength data from Fermi-LAT,\nChandra, HST, EVN, VLBA and the Liverpool Telescope. The averaged VHE gamma-ray\nspectrum can be fitted from 100GeV to 10TeV with a simple power law with a\nphoton index of (-2.41 $\\pm$ 0.07), while the integral flux above 300GeV is\n$(1.44 \\pm 0.13) \\times 10^{-12} cm^{-2} s^{-1}$.

The VHE gamma-ray flux from the present 2012-2015 M87 campaign is\nconsistent with a constant flux with some hint of variability ($\\sim3\\sigma$)\non a daily timescale in 2013. The low-state gamma-ray emission likely\noriginates from the same region as the flare-state emission.

We theoretically investigated how solar parameters, such as the\nsolar wind dynamic pressure and the solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) flux,\ninfluence the bow shock location, which is still currently not well understood.\nWe present the formula for the location of the bow shock nose of the\nunmagnetized planet. The bow shock location, the sum of the ionopause location\nand bow shock standoff distance, is calculated in the gasdynamics approach. The\nionopause location is determined using thermal pressure continuity, i.e., the\nsolar wind thermal pressure equal to the ionospheric pressure, according to\ntangential discontinuity. The analytical formula of the ionopause nose location\nand the ionopause profile around the nose are obtained. The standoff distance\nis calculated using the empirical model. Our derived formula shows that the\nshock nose location is a function of the scale height of ionosphere, the\ndynamic pressure of the solar wind and the peak ionospheric pressure. The\ntheoretical model implies that the shock nose location is more sensitive to the\nsolar EUV flux than solar wind dynamics pressure. Further, we theoretically\nshow that the bow shock location is proportional to the solar wind dynamic\npressure to the power of negative C, where C is about the ratio of the\nionospheric scale height to the distance between bow shock nose and the planet\ncenter.

These defects are predicted to\nbe quite mobile at room temperature and to exhibit a strong tendency to\nagglomerate. In addition, our calculations indicate that the defect-induced\ndeviation from the nominal stoichiometry largely impacts the local magnetic\nmoments, thereby suggesting a marked interplay between magnetism and disorder\nin CrI$_3$. Overall, this work portrays a comprehensive picture of intrinsic\npoint defects in monolayer CrI$_3$ from a theoretical perspective.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jan 2020 16:29:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-26"}

Methods: We start with estimating and visualizing\nlinks within and among extracted multimodal data features using a Gaussian\ngraphical model (GGM).

ANNs have also shown great success in\nmusic-related tasks including music summarization and classification,\nsimilarity estimation, computer-aided or autonomous composition, and automatic\nmusic analysis.

First, using probability estimations of a Restricted Boltzmann\nMachine (RBM), a probabilistic bottom-up approach to melody segmentation is\nstudied. Then, a top-down method for imposing a high-level structural template\nin music generation is presented, which combines Gibbs sampling using a\nconvolutional RBM with gradient-descent optimization on the intermediate\nsolutions. Furthermore, I motivate the relevance of musical transformations in\nstructure modeling and show how a connectionist model, the Gated Autoencoder\n(GAE), can be employed to learn transformations between musical fragments. For\nlearning transformations in sequences, I propose a special predictive training\nof the GAE, which yields a representation of polyphonic music as a sequence of\nintervals. Furthermore, the applicability of these interval representations to\na top-down discovery of repeated musical sections is shown. Finally, a\nrecurrent variant of the GAE is proposed, and its efficacy in music prediction\nand modeling of low-level repetition structure is demonstrated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jan 2020 18:35:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

Similar to other clusters at\nthis age, NGC 1846 shows an extended main sequence turn-off (eMSTO), and\nprevious photometric studies have suggested it could be bimodal. In this study,\nwe use MUSE integral-field spectroscopy to measure the projected rotational\nvelocities (vsini) of around 1400 stars across the eMSTO and along the upper\nmain sequence of NGC 1846. We measure vsini values up to ~250 km/s and find a\nclear relation between the vsini of a star and its location across the eMSTO.\nCloser inspection of the distribution of rotation rates reveals evidence for a\nbimodal distribution, with the fast rotators centred around vsini = 140 km/s\nand the slow rotators centred around vsini = 60 km/s. We further observe a lack\nof fast rotating stars along the photometric binary sequence of NGC 1846,\nconfirming results from the field that suggest that tidal interactions in\nbinary systems can spin down stars. However, we do not detect a significant\ndifference in the binary fractions of the fast and slowly rotating\nsub-populations.

In this paper, we\npresent an analysis of the time-constrained adaptive influence maximization\nproblem. We show that the new problem is combinatorially different from the\nexisting problems, and the current techniques such as submodular maximization\nand adaptive submodularity are unfortunately inapplicable. On the theory side,\nwe provide the hardness results of computing the optimal policy and a lower\nbound on the adaptive gap. For practical solutions, from basic to advanced, we\ndesign a series of seeding policies for achieving high efficacy and\nscalability. Finally, we investigate the proposed solutions through extensive\nsimulations based on real-world datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jan 2020 19:12:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Mar 2020 21:38:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-30"}

One of the oldest and at the same time one of the newest concerns of\nhumanity is \"How did the Earth and the planets come to be?\". Planet formation,\nan intricate and potentially chaotic process, is also very efficient. Every\nstar harbors at least one planet, as evidenced by the high frequency of\nexoplanet detections. Planet formation must therefore be a frequent process.\nYet, learning about the origins of planets has been difficult.

The Virgo detector was also taking\ndata that did not contribute to detection due to a low signal-to-noise ratio,\nbut were used for subsequent parameter estimation.

A\nsignificant redesign of conventional networking techniques is necessary to\nrealize TI applications. Further, these advancements can be evaluated only when\nmeaningful performance metrics are available. However, existing TI performance\nmetrics fall severely short of comprehensively characterizing TI performance.\nIn this paper, we take the first step towards bridging this gap.

Both in-situ and\nex-situ characterizations indicate these films are highly crystalline and\nc-axis oriented, with atomically smooth surfaces. However, the films grow as\ndisconnected islands, with lateral dimensions on the micron scale. By\npatterning Pt electrodes using a focused electron beam, longitudinal and\ntransverse resistance of single islands have been measured in magnetic fields.\nOur work opens a pathway for exploring mesoscale transport properties in thin\nfilms of Kagome materials and related devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jan 2020 00:19:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 15 Nov 2020 17:36:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-17"}

The exiting studies\nall assume this knowledge to be all but one vertex on the path. To prevent the\nadversaries recovering the missing information, they publish a perturbed path\nwhere each vertex is sampled from a pre-defined set with differential privacy\n(DP) to replace the corresponding vertex in the original path. In this paper,\nwe relax this assumption to be all but one edge on the path, and hence consider\nthe scenario of more powerful adversaries with the maximum background knowledge\nof the entire network topology and the path (including all the vertices) except\none (arbitrary) missing edge. Under such an assumption, the perturbed path\nproduced by the existing work is vulnerable, because the adversary can\nreconstruct the missing edge from the existence of an edge in the perturbed\npath. To address this vulnerability and effectively protect edge privacy,\ninstead of publishing a perturbed path, we propose a novel scheme of\ngraph-based path publishing to protect the original path by embedding the path\nin a graph that contains fake edges and replicated vertices applying the\ndifferential privacy technique, such that only the legitimate users who have\nthe full knowledge of the network topology are able to recover the exact\nvertices and edges of the original path with high probability.

Existing listwise learning-to-rank models\nare generally derived from the classical Plackett-Luce model, which has three\nmajor limitations. (1) Its permutation probabilities overlook ties, i.e., a\nsituation when more than one document has the same rating with respect to a\nquery. This can lead to imprecise permutation probabilities and inefficient\ntraining because of selecting documents one by one. (2) It does not favor\ndocuments having high relevance. (3) It has a loose assumption that sampling\ndocuments at different steps is independent. To overcome the first two\nlimitations, we model ranking as selecting documents from a candidate set based\non unique rating levels in decreasing order. The number of steps in training is\ndetermined by the number of unique rating levels. We propose a new loss\nfunction and associated four models for the entire sequence of weighted\nclassification tasks by assigning high weights to the selected documents with\nhigh ratings for optimizing Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG). To\novercome the final limitation, we further propose a novel and efficient way of\nrefining prediction scores by combining an adapted Vanilla Recurrent Neural\nNetwork (RNN) model with pooling given selected documents at previous steps.

Although the vaccine for measles is\nreadily available and highly successful, its current adoption is not adequate\nto prevent epidemics. Vaccine adoption is directly affected by individual\nvaccination decisions, and has a complex interplay with the spatial spread of\ndisease shaped by an underlying mobility (travelling) network. In this paper,\nwe model the travelling connectivity as a scale-free network, and investigate\ndependencies between the network's assortativity and the resultant epidemic and\nvaccination dynamics. In doing so we extend an SIR-network model with\ngame-theoretic components, capturing the imitation dynamics under a voluntary\nvaccination scheme. Our results show a correlation between the epidemic\ndynamics and the network's assortativity, highlighting that networks with high\nassortativity tend to suppress epidemics under certain conditions. In highly\nassortative networks, the suppression is sustained producing an early\nconvergence to equilibrium. In highly disassortative networks, however, the\nsuppression effect diminishes over time due to scattering of non-vaccinating\nnodes, and frequent switching between the predominantly vaccinating and\nnon-vaccinating phases of the dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jan 2020 02:08:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Jun 2020 09:30:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

Using second-order\ncalculus of variations, we derive a formula that provides a practical condition\nfor IB phase transitions, and draw its connection with the Fisher information\nmatrix for parameterized models. We provide two perspectives to understand the\nformula, revealing that each IB phase transition is finding a component of\nmaximum (nonlinear) correlation between $X$ and $Y$ orthogonal to the learned\nrepresentation, in close analogy with canonical-correlation analysis (CCA) in\nlinear settings.

However, collected data and labeled instances\nare limited in reality, which means that only a small closed set is observed.\nExisting methods typically model this task in a regression manner, while they\nare prone to suffer from an unseen scene with counts out of the scope of the\nclosed set. In fact, counting has an interesting and exclusive\nproperty---spatially decomposable. A dense region can always be divided until\nsub-region counts are within the previously observed closed set. We therefore\nintroduce the idea of spatial divide-and-conquer (S-DC) that transforms\nopen-set counting into a closed-set problem.

We evaluate three methods of\nleveraging name similarity scores in large-scale probabilistic record linkage,\nwhich can adapt to varying match prevalence and information in supporting\nfields: (1) setting a threshold score based on predicted quality of\nname-matching across all record pairs; (2) setting a threshold score based on\npredicted discriminatory power of the linkage model; and (3) using empirical\nscore distributions among matches and nonmatches to perform Bayesian adjustment\nof matching probabilities estimated from exact-agreement linkage. In\nexperiments on holdout data, as well as data simulated with varying name error\nrates and supporting fields, a logistic regression classifier incorporated via\nthe Bayesian method demonstrated marked improvements over exact-agreement\nlinkage with respect to discriminatory power, match probability estimation, and\naccuracy, reducing the total number of misclassified record pairs by 21% in\ntest data and up to an average of 93% in simulated datasets. Our results\ndemonstrate the value of incorporating visual, phonetic, and keystroke\nsimilarity for logographic name matching, as well as the promise of our\nBayesian approach to leverage name-matching within large-scale record linkage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jan 2020 05:21:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

In the case of weak thermal coupling in the\nsynchronization mode, we observe in-phase behavior of oscillators, and there is\na certain range of parameters of the supply current, in which the\nsynchronization effect becomes possible. With a decrease in dimensions, a\ndecrease in the thermal coupling action radius is observed, which can vary in\nthe range from 0.5 to 50 {\\mu}m for structures with characteristic dimensions\nof 0.1 to 5 {\\mu}m, respectively. Thermal coupling may have a promising effect\nfor realization of a 3D integrated oscillatory neural network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jan 2020 07:20:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

In analogy with\ndisordered systems, we consider the flux distribution both for the annealed and\nthe quenched initial conditions, for the passive and active particles.

Here, we investigate the effect of metallicity\non the detectability of rotation periods.

These light curves are then used as an input to\nthe period determination algorithms. We find that the success rate for\nrecovering the rotation signal has a minimum close to the solar metallicity\nvalue.

A so-called\ncompartmentalized finite element model was developed. In this model, each\nelement was assigned a unique linear elastic J2 plastic behavior without\nhardening. The model's specificity lied in the fact that: (i) a statistical\ndistribution was discretized in a deterministic way and used to assign yield\nstresses to structures called compartments; (ii) those compartments were\nrandomly associated with the elements through a random compartment element\nmapping (CEM).

The cell volume\nfraction, cell velocity--fluid pressure system, and nutrient concentration are\nthe model variables. A coupled system of a hyperbolic conservation law, \\cred{a\nviscous fluid model}, and a parabolic diffusion equation governs the dynamics\nof the model variables. The tumour boundary moves with the normal velocity of\nthe outermost layer of cells, and this time--dependence is a challenge in\ndesigning and implementing a stable and fast numerical scheme. We recast the\nmodel into a form where the hyperbolic equation is defined on a fixed extended\ndomain and retrieve the tumour boundary as the interface at which the cell\nvolume fraction decreases below a threshold value.

These have\nmostly been studied in the case of \"dry\" active matter, where particle dynamics\nare dominated by friction with their surroundings. Significantly less is known\nabout systems with long-range hydrodynamic interactions that belong to \"wet\"\nactive matter. Dilute suspensions of motile bacteria, modelled as\nself-propelled dipolar particles interacting solely through long-ranged\nhydrodynamic fields, are arguably the most studied example from this class of\nactive systems. Their phenomenology is well-established: at sufficiently high\ndensity of bacteria, there appear large-scale vortices and jets comprising many\nindividual organisms, forming a chaotic state commonly known as bacterial\nturbulence. As revealed by computer simulations, below the onset of collective\nmotion, the suspension exhibits very strong correlations between individual\nmicroswimmers stemming from the long-ranged nature of dipolar fields. Here we\ndemonstrate that this phenomenology is captured by the minimal model of\nmicroswimmers.

The softmax function partitions the\ntransformed input space into cones, each of which encompasses a class.

Here we show that unpatterned planar optical films\ncan be exploited for low-loss two-dimensional waveguiding by using `space-time'\nwave packets, which are the unique family of one-dimensional\npropagation-invariant pulsed optical beams. We observe `hybrid guided'\nspace-time modes that are index-guided in one transverse dimension in the film\nand localized along the unbounded transverse dimension via the intrinsic\nspatio-temporal structure of the field. We demonstrate that these field\nconfigurations enable overriding the boundary conditions by varying\npost-fabrication the group index of the fundamental mode in a 2-$\\mu$m-thick,\n25-mm-long silica film, which is achieved by modifying the field's\nspatio-temporal structure along the unbounded dimension.

The impact of specific\ndensity structures is marked by a higher occurrence of magnetic field reversals\nmeasured by the FIELDS magnetometers. Magnetic reversals originating from the\nstreamers are associated with larger density variations compared with reversals\noriginating outside streamers.

Consequently, developers are\ntypically forced to marry their wait-free data structures with lock-free Hazard\nPointers or (potentially blocking) epoch-based memory reclamation. Since both\nthese schemes provide weaker progress guarantees, they essentially forfeit the\nstrong progress guarantee of wait-free data structures.

Presently there are two competitive models to\nexplain it: blurred ionized reflection and warm Comptonisation. In the latter\ncase, observations suggest a corona temperature $\\sim$ 1 keV and a corona\noptical depth $\\sim$ 10. Moreover, radiative constraints from spectral fits\nwith Comptonisation models suggest that most of the accretion power should be\nreleased in the warm corona. The disk below is basically non-dissipative,\nradiating only the reprocessed emission from the corona. The true radiative\nproperties of such a warm and optically thick plasma are not well-known,\nhowever. For instance, the importance of the Comptonisation process, the\npotential presence of strong absorption/emission features or the spectral shape\nof the output spectrum have been studied only very recently. We present in this\npaper simulations of warm and optically thick coronae using the TITAN radiative\ntransfer code coupled with the NOAR Monte-Carlo code, the latter fully\naccounting for Compton scattering of continuum and lines. Illumination from\nabove by a hard X-ray emission and from below by an optically thick accretion\ndisk is taken into account as well as (uniform) internal heating. Our\nsimulations show that for a large part of the parameter space, the warm corona\nwith sufficient internal mechanical heating is dominated by Compton cooling and\nneither strong absorption nor emission lines are present in the outgoing\nspectra. In a smaller part of the parameter space, the calculated emission\nagrees with the spectral shape of the observed soft X-ray excess. Remarkably,\nthis also corresponds to the conditions of radiative equilibrium of an extended\nwarm corona covering almost entirely a non-dissipative accretion disk.

To this end, we have adapted a\nfictitious domain method to enable the simulation of hydromechanical processes\nin fracture-intersections. The main characteristic of the method is the\nimmersion of the fracture, modelled as a linear elastic solid, in the\nsurrounding computational fluid domain, modelled with the incompressible Navier\nStokes equations. The fluid and the solid problems are coupled with variational\ntransfer operators.

The two well-behavedness laws of lenses, namely Correctness and\nHippocraticness, are usually adopted as the guarantee of these systems. While\nlenses are designed to retain information in the source when the view is\nmodified, well-behavedness says very little about the retaining of information:\nHippocraticness only requires that the source be unchanged if the view is not\nmodified, and nothing about information retention is guaranteed when the view\nis changed. To address the problem, we propose an extension of the original\nlenses, called retentive lenses, which satisfy a new Retentiveness law\nguaranteeing that if parts of the view are unchanged, then the corresponding\nparts of the source are retained as well.

In this work, we show that both the discovery latency\nand energy consumption can be significantly reduced by using fully digital\nfront-ends. In fact, we establish that by reducing the resolution of the\nfully-digital front-ends we can achieve lower energy consumption compared to\nboth analog and high-resolution digital beamformers. Since beamforming through\nanalog front-ends allows sampling in only one direction at a time, the mobile\ndevice is ''on'' for a longer time compared to a digital beamformer which can\nget spatial samples from all directions in one shot. We show that the energy\nconsumed by the analog front-end can be four to six times more than that of the\ndigital front-ends, depending on the size of the employed antenna arrays. We\nrecognize, however, that using fully digital beamforming post beam discovery,\ni.e., for data transmission, is not viable from a power consumption standpoint.\nTo address this issue, we propose the use of digital beamformers with\nlow-resolution analog to digital converters (4 bits). This reduction in\nresolution brings the power consumption to the same level as analog beamforming\nfor data transmissions while benefiting from the spatial multiplexing\ncapabilities of fully digital beamforming, thus reducing initial discovery\nlatency and improving energy efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jan 2020 13:55:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

We also study the influence of some\nfactors that should be considered in practical observations to model parameter\ninference.

In these scenarios, full automation is often\nundesirable, not only due to the significance of the outcome, but also because\nhuman experts can draw on their domain knowledge complementary to the model's\nto ensure task success. We refer to these scenarios as AI-assisted decision\nmaking, where the individual strengths of the human and the AI come together to\noptimize the joint decision outcome. A key to their success is to appropriately\n\\textit{calibrate} human trust in the AI on a case-by-case basis; knowing when\nto trust or distrust the AI allows the human expert to appropriately apply\ntheir knowledge, improving decision outcomes in cases where the model is likely\nto perform poorly.

Both results, however, rely on\nthe assumption that the genomes under comparison contain the same set of unique\nmarkers (syntenic genomic regions, sometimes also referred to as genes). In\n2015, Shao, Lin and Moret relax this condition by allowing for duplicate\nmarkers in the analysis. This generalized version of the genomic distance\nproblem is NP-hard, and they give an ILP solution that is efficient enough to\nbe applied to real-world datasets. A restriction of their approach is that it\ncan be applied only to balanced genomes, that have equal numbers of duplicates\nof any marker. Therefore it still needs a delicate preprocessing of the input\ndata in which excessive copies of unbalanced markers have to be removed.\n  In this paper we present an algorithm solving the genomic distance problem\nfor natural genomes, in which any marker may occur an arbitrary number of\ntimes. Our method is based on a new graph data structure, the multi-relational\ndiagram, that allows an elegant extension of the ILP by Shao, Lin and Moret to\ncount runs of markers that are under- or over-represented in one genome with\nrespect to the other and need to be inserted or deleted, respectively. With\nthis extension, previous restrictions on the genome configurations are lifted,\nfor the first time enabling an uncompromising rearrangement analysis. Any\nmarker sequence can directly be used for the distance calculation.\n  The evaluation of our approach shows that it can be used to analyze genomes\nwith up to a few ten thousand markers, which we demonstrate on simulated and\nreal data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jan 2020 15:55:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Jan 2020 13:49:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 15 Apr 2020 15:28:36 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 2 Oct 2020 18:40:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-11"}

UVIT observations have revealed signatures of\npositive AGN feedback in Mrk 739 and Mrk 212, and negative feedback in ESO 509.\nDeeper UVIT observations have recently been approved; these will provide better\nconstraints on star-formation as well as AGN feedback in these systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jan 2020 06:06:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-14"}

One approach to develop a data-driven material model is to use\nmachine learning tools. These can be trained offline to fit an observed\nmaterial behaviour and then be applied in online applications. However,\nlearning and predicting history dependent material models, such as plasticity,\nis still challenging. In this work, a machine learning based material modelling\nframework is proposed for both elasticity and plasticity. The machine learning\nbased hyperelasticity model is developed with the Feed forward Neural Network\n(FNN) directly whereas the machine learning based plasticity model is developed\nby using of a novel method called Proper Orthogonal Decomposition Feed forward\nNeural Network (PODFNN). In order to account for the loading history, the\naccumulated absolute strain is proposed to be the history variable of the\nplasticity model. Additionally, the strain-stress sequence data for plasticity\nis collected from different loading-unloading paths based on the concept of\nsequence for plasticity. By means of the POD, the multi-dimensional stress\nsequence is decoupled leading to independent one dimensional coefficient\nsequences. In this case, the neural network with multiple output is replaced by\nmultiple independent neural networks each possessing a one-dimensional output,\nwhich leads to less training time and better training performance. To apply the\nmachine learning based material model in finite element analysis, the tangent\nmatrix is derived by the automatic symbolic differentiation tool AceGen.

In several applications, these outliers or anomalous\ninstances are of greater interest compared to the normal ones. Specifically in\nthe case of industrial optical inspection and infrastructure asset management,\nfinding these defects (anomalous regions) is of extreme importance.\nTraditionally and even today this process has been carried out manually. Humans\nrely on the saliency of the defects in comparison to the normal texture to\ndetect the defects. However, manual inspection is slow, tedious, subjective and\nsusceptible to human biases. Therefore, the automation of defect detection is\ndesirable. But for defect detection lack of availability of a large number of\nanomalous instances and labelled data is a problem. In this paper, we present a\nconvolutional auto-encoder architecture for anomaly detection that is trained\nonly on the defect-free (normal) instances. For the test images, residual masks\nthat are obtained by subtracting the original image from the auto-encoder\noutput are thresholded to obtain the defect segmentation masks.

Since typically neural networks process\na very large amount of data, it is convenient to formulate them within the\nmean-field and kinetic theory. In this work we focus on a particular class of\nneural networks, i.e. the residual neural networks, assuming that each layer is\ncharacterized by the same number of neurons $N$, which is fixed by the\ndimension of the data. This assumption allows to interpret the residual neural\nnetwork as a time-discretized ordinary differential equation, in analogy with\nneural differential equations. The mean-field description is then obtained in\nthe limit of infinitely many input data. This leads to a Vlasov-type partial\ndifferential equation which describes the evolution of the distribution of the\ninput data. We analyze steady states and sensitivity with respect to the\nparameters of the network, namely the weights and the bias. In the simple\nsetting of a linear activation function and one-dimensional input data, the\nstudy of the moments provides insights on the choice of the parameters of the\nnetwork. Furthermore, a modification of the microscopic dynamics, inspired by\nstochastic residual neural networks, leads to a Fokker-Planck formulation of\nthe network, in which the concept of network training is replaced by the task\nof fitting distributions. The performed analysis is validated by artificial\nnumerical simulations. In particular, results on classification and regression\nproblems are presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jan 2020 13:41:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 16:41:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2020 10:13:05 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 8 Nov 2021 20:56:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-10"}

The different\nmovability of localized OVs and itinerary electrons in the fSTO yield a\nunidirectional electric polarization at the interface of the junction under the\ncoaction of external and built-in electric fields. Moreover, the fSTO displays\na pre-ferroelectric state located between paraelectric and ferroelectric\nphases. The pre-ferroelectric state has three sub-states and can be easily\ndriven into a ferroelectric state by external electric field. These\nobservations open up opportunities for potential polar devices and may underpin\nmany useful polar-triggered electronic phenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jan 2020 04:31:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-09"}
