It is shown that for\nsmall toroidal fields, $ \\alpha <\\kappa^{1/4} $, the maximum Lorentz factor $\n\\gamma_m $ is only the square root of magnetization, $ \\gamma_m = \\kappa^{-1/2}\n$, while for large toroidal fields, $ \\alpha >\\kappa^{1/4} $, the energy\nincreases significantly, $ \\gamma_m = \\kappa^{-2/3} $. However, the maximum\npossible acceleration, $ \\gamma_m = \\kappa^{-1} $, is not achieved in the\nmagnetosphere. For a number of active galactic nuclei, such as M87, maximum\nvalues of Lorentz factor for accelerated protons are found. Also for special\ncase of Sgr. A* estimations of the maximum proton energy and its energy flux\nare obtained. They are in agreement with experimental data obtained by HESS\nCherenkov telescope.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jan 2020 16:49:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-22"}

In the seminal work by\nMaddah-Ali and Niesen (MAN), the shared-link coded caching problem was\nformulated, where each user demands one file (i.e., single file retrieval).\nThis paper generalizes the MAN problem so as to allow users to request scalar\nlinear functions of the files. This paper proposes a novel coded delivery\nscheme that, based on MAN uncoded cache placement, is shown to allow for the\ndecoding of arbitrary scalar linear functions of the files (on arbitrary finite\nfields). Interestingly, and quite surprisingly, it is shown that the load for\ncache-aided scalar linear function retrieval depends on the number of linearly\nindependent functions that are demanded, akin to the cache-aided single-file\nretrieval problem where the load depends on the number of distinct file\nrequests. The proposed scheme is optimal under the constraint of uncoded cache\nplacement, in terms of worst-case load, and within a factor 2 otherwise. The\nkey idea of this paper can be extended to all scenarios which the original MAN\nscheme has been extended to, including demand-private and/or device-to-device\nsettings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jan 2020 17:39:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-13"}

Our approach\naddresses a major obstacle of the integrated microwave photonics caused by the\npolarization constraints of both active and passive components. In addition to\nsub-wavelength confinement, typical for surface plasmon polaritons, the edge\nplasmon modes enable exact matching of the polarization requirements for\nsilicon based input/output grating couplers, waveguides and electro-optical\nmodulators. A concept of the hybrid waveguide, implemented in a sandwich-like\nstructure, implies a coupling of propagating plasmon modes with a waveguide\nmode. The vertically arranged sandwich includes a thin layer of\nepsilon-near-zero material (indium tin oxide) providing an efficient modulation\nat small length scales. Employed edge plasmons possess a mixed polarization\nstate and can be excited with horizontally polarized waveguide modes. It allows\nthe resulting modulator to work directly with efficient grating couplers and\navoid using bulky and lossy polarization converters.

Numerically heavy computations involving the optimization of\nmaterials and geometry have been performed. Effective modes, stationary state\nfield distribution, an extinction coefficient, optical losses and charge\ntransport properties are computed and analyzed. In addition to the polarization\nmatching, the advantages of the proposed model include the compact planar\ngeometry of the silicon waveguide, reduced active electric resistance R and a\nrelatively simple design, attractive for experimental realization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jan 2020 17:40:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-13"}

Furthermore, the formulation is developed from standard approaches\nfor independent inversion of single data sets, and, thus, also facilitates the\ninclusion of necessary model and data weighting matrices that provide, for\nexample, depth weighting and imposition of hard constraint data.

Moreover, we found that the combined\nspectra from XMM-Newton (EPIC-PN) and AstroSat (SXT+LAXPC) indicated the\npresence of reflection features in the form of iron (Fe K${\\alpha}$) line that\nwe modeled with the reflection model xillvercp. One of the two X-ray burst\nobserved during the AstroSat/LAXPC observation showed hard X-ray emission (>30\nkeV) due to Compton up-scattering of thermal photons by the hot corona.

Unfortunately, this spectroscopic approach is not always\nviable since the energies of the topological modes are not protected and they\ncan often overlap the bulk bands, leading to potential misidentification. Since\nthe topology of a material is a collective product of all its eigenmodes, any\nconclusive indicator of topology must instead be a feature of its bulk band\nstructure, and should not rely on specific eigen-energies.

While\nsuch models are able to learn diverse distributions, provided a sufficiently\nlarge training set, they are not well-suited for scenarios where the\ndistribution of the training data exhibits a multi-modal behavior. In such\ncases, reshaping a uniform or normal distribution over the latent space into a\ncomplex multi-modal distribution in the data domain is challenging, and the\ngenerator might fail to sample the target distribution well. Furthermore,\nexisting unsupervised generative models are not able to control the mode of the\ngenerated samples independently of the other visual attributes, despite the\nfact that they are typically disentangled in the training data.\n  In this paper, we introduce UMMGAN, a novel architecture designed to better\nmodel multi-modal distributions, in an unsupervised fashion.

Conditions for stable synchronization in a system\nof linearly coupled predator-prey oscillators have been considered in the past.\nHowever, the spatial dispersion coupling may be relatively weak and may not\nnecessarily lead to a stable, complete synchrony. If the coupling between\noscillators is too weak to induce a stable synchrony, oscillators may be\nengaged into intermittent synchrony, when episodes of synchronized dynamics are\ninterspersed with the episodes of desynchronized dynamics. In the present study\nwe consider the temporal patterning of this kind of intermittent synchronized\ndynamics in a system of two dispersal-coupled Rosenzweig-MacArthur\npredator-prey oscillators.

We also show that if the dynamics of predator is slow\nrelative to the dynamics of the prey (a situation that may promote brief but\nlarge outbreaks), dispersal-coupled predator-prey oscillating populations\nexhibit numerous short desynchronizations (as opposed to few long\ndesynchronizations) and may require weaker dispersal in order to reach strong\nsynchrony.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jan 2020 20:28:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-26"}

This construction is called the\ncanonical polygonal schema of the manifold, and is a key ingredient for many\napplications in graphics and engineering, where a parameterization between two\nshapes with same topology is often needed. The sides of the 4g-gon define on\nthe manifold a system of loops, which all intersect at a single point and are\ndisjoint elsewhere. Computing a shortest system of loops of this kind is\nNP-hard. A computationally tractable alternative consists in computing a set of\nshortest loops that are not fully disjoint in polynomial time, using the greedy\nhomotopy basis algorithm proposed by Erickson and Whittlesey, and then detach\nthem in post processing via mesh refinement. Despite this operation is\nconceptually simple, known refinement strategies do not scale well for high\ngenus shapes, triggering a mesh growth that may exceed the amount of memory\navailable in modern computers, leading to failures. In this paper we study\nvarious local refinement operators to detach cycles in a system of loops, and\nshow that there are important differences between them, both in terms of mesh\ncomplexity and preservation of the original surface. We ultimately propose two\nnovel refinement approaches: the former minimizes the number of new elements in\nthe mesh, possibly at the cost of a deviation from the input geometry. The\nlatter allows to trade mesh complexity for geometric accuracy, bounding\ndeviation from the input surface. Both strategies are trivial to implement, and\nexperiments confirm that they allow to realize canonical polygonal schemas even\nfor extremely high genus shapes where previous methods fail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jan 2020 20:53:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-14"}

The presented non-perturbative model is based on the picture in\nwhich three relativistic valence quarks occupy the nucleon core at distances of\n$\\le 0.5$ Fm while interacting in the mean field generated by the residual\nnucleon system. The calculations are based on the assumption of the a\nfactorization of the internal interaction of short-range three valence quarks\nwith the long-range interaction of these quarks with the residual system.

This allows not only for an estimate of\nthe parameters, but also for the quantification of uncertainties in the\nestimates. Often in such problems the parameter-to-data map is very expensive\nto evaluate, and computing derivatives of the map, or derivative-adjoints, may\nnot be feasible. Additionally, in many applications only noisy evaluations of\nthe map may be available. We propose an approach to Bayesian inversion in such\nsettings that builds on the derivative-free optimization capabilities of\nensemble Kalman inversion methods. The overarching approach is to first use\nensemble Kalman sampling (EKS) to calibrate the unknown parameters to fit the\ndata; second, to use the output of the EKS to emulate the parameter-to-data\nmap; third, to sample from an approximate Bayesian posterior distribution in\nwhich the parameter-to-data map is replaced by its emulator. This results in a\nprincipled approach to approximate Bayesian inference that requires only a\nsmall number of evaluations of the (possibly noisy approximation of the)\nparameter-to-data map. It does not require derivatives of this map, but instead\nleverages the documented power of ensemble Kalman methods. Furthermore, the EKS\nhas the desirable property that it evolves the parameter ensembles towards the\nregions in which the bulk of the parameter posterior mass is located, thereby\nlocating them well for the emulation phase of the methodology. In essence, the\nEKS methodology provides a cheap solution to the design problem of where to\nplace points in parameter space to efficiently train an emulator of the\nparameter-to-data map for the purposes of Bayesian inversion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jan 2020 23:19:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-28"}

Especially the prototypical SSA22a-LAB1 at $z=3.1$ has\nbecome an observational reference for LABs across the electromagnetic spectrum.\n  Aims: We want to understand the powering mechanisms that drive the LAB to\ngain empirical insights into galaxy formation processes within a rare dense\nenvironment at high-$z$.\n  Methods: LAB 1 was observed for 17.5h with the VLT/MUSE integral-field\nspectrograph. We produced optimally extracted narrow band images in Ly$\\alpha$\n$\\lambda1216$ and HeII $\\lambda1640$. By using a moment based analysis we\nmapped the kinematics of the blob.\n  Results: We detect Ly$\\alpha$ emission to surface-brightness limits of\n$10^{-19}$erg s$^{-1}$cm$^{-2}$arcsec$^{-2}$. At this depth we reveal a bridge\nbetween LAB 1 and its northern neighbour LAB 8, as well as a shell-like\nfilament towards the south of LAB 1. We find a coherent large scale east-west\n$\\sim$1000 km s$^{-1}$ velocity gradient that is aligned perpendicular to the\nmajor axis of the blob. We detect HeII emission in three distinct regions, but\nwe can only provide upper limits for CIV.\n  Conclusions: Various gas excitation mechanisms are at play in LAB 1: Ionising\nradiation and feedback effects dominate near the embedded galaxies, while\nLy$\\alpha$ scattering is contributing at larger distances. However,\nHeII/Ly$\\alpha$ ratios combined with upper limits on CIV/Ly$\\alpha$ can not\ndiscriminate between AGN ionisation and feedback driven shocks.

For\nmore than 100 years, many human mobility prediction models have been proposed,\namong which the gravity model analogous to Newton's law of gravitation is\nwidely used. Another classical model is the intervening opportunity (IO) model,\nwhich indicates that an individual selecting a destination is related to both\nthe destination's opportunities and the intervening opportunities between the\norigin and the destination. The IO model established from the perspective of\nindividual selection behavior has recently triggered the establishment of many\nnew IO class models. Although these IO class models can achieve accurate\nprediction at specific spatiotemporal scales, an IO class model that can\ndescribe an individual's destination selection behavior at different\nspatiotemporal scales is still lacking. Here, we develop a universal\nopportunity model that considers two human behavioral tendencies: one is the\nexploratory tendency, and the other is the cautious tendency. Our model\nestablishes a new framework in IO class models and covers the classical\nradiation model and opportunity priority selection model. Furthermore, we use\nvarious mobility data to demonstrate our model's predictive ability. The\nresults show that our model can better predict human mobility than previous IO\nclass models. Moreover, this model can help us better understand the underlying\nmechanism of the individual's destination selection behavior in different types\nof human mobility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Jan 2020 02:18:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-01"}

The proposed modality is\nbased on spatial temporal graph representations of surgical tools in videos,\nfor surgical activity recognition. To explore its effectiveness, we model and\nrecognize surgical gestures with the proposed modality. We construct spatial\ngraphs connecting the joint pose estimations of surgical tools.

Recent attacks\nexploiting the leakage in dynamic operations drive rapid development of new SE\nschemes revealing less information while performing updates; they are also\nknown as forward and backward private SE.

All servers store the same set of $M$\nmessages and they respond to the user through a block fading Gaussian Multiple\nAccess Channel (MAC). The goal in this setting is to keep the index of the\nrequired message private from the servers while minimizing the overall\ncommunication overhead.\n  This work provides joint privacy and channel coding retrieval schemes for the\nGaussian MAC with and without fading. The schemes exploit the linearity of the\nchannel while using the Compute and Forward (CF) coding scheme. Consequently,\nsingle-user encoding and decoding are performed to retrieve the private\nmessage. In the case of a channel without fading, the achievable retrieval rate\nis shown to outperform a separation-based scheme, in which the retrieval and\nthe channel coding are designed separately. Moreover, this rate is\nasymptotically optimal as the SNR grows, and are up to a constant gap of $2$\nbits per channel use from the channel capacity without privacy constraints, for\nall SNR values. When the channel suffers from fading, the asymmetry between the\nservers' channels forces a more complicated solution, which involves a hard\noptimization problem. Nevertheless, we provide coding scheme and lower bounds\non the expected achievable retrieval rate which are shown to have the same\nscaling laws as the channel capacity, both in the number of servers and the\nSNR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Jan 2020 13:58:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Jan 2020 13:08:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 16 Jan 2020 10:38:45 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 19 May 2020 12:10:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-20"}

To overcome this drawback, a few methods try to select\nsome key frames and then perform attacks based on them. Unfortunately, their\nselection strategy is independent of the attacking step, therefore the\nresulting performance is limited. Instead, we argue the frame selection phase\nis closely relevant with the attacking phase. The key frames should be adjusted\naccording to the attacking results. For that, we formulate the black-box video\nattacks into a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework. Specifically, the\nenvironment in RL is set as the recognition model, and the agent in RL plays\nthe role of frame selecting. By continuously querying the recognition models\nand receiving the attacking feedback, the agent gradually adjusts its frame\nselection strategy and adversarial perturbations become smaller and smaller. We\nconduct a series of experiments with two mainstream video recognition models:\nC3D and LRCN on the public UCF-101 and HMDB-51 datasets.

Phenomena such as\ndeformation-induced microstructure evolution, microfracture, and microvoid\nnucleation are examples of applications for which accurate stress and strain\nfields are required. A characteristic feature of these simulations is that the\nproblem domain is simple (typically a rectilinear representative volume element\n(RVE)), but the evolution of internal topological features is extremely\ncomplex. Traditionally, the finite element method (FEM) is used for elasticity\ncalculations; FEM is nearly ubiquituous due to (1) its ability to handle meshes\nof complex geometry using isoparametric elements, and (2) the weak formulation\nwhich eschews the need for computation of second derivatives. However, variable\ntopology problems (e.g. microstructure evolution) require either remeshing, or\nadaptive mesh refinement (AMR) - both of which can cause extensive overhead and\nlimited scaling. Block-structured AMR (BSAMR) is a method for adaptive mesh\nrefinement that exhibits good scaling and is well-suited for many problems in\nmaterials science. Here, it is shown that the equations of elasticity can be\nefficiently solved using BSAMR using the finite difference method. The boundary\noperator method is used to treat different types of boundary conditions, and\nthe \"reflux-free\" method is introduced to efficiently and easily treat the\ncoarse-fine boundaries that arise in BSAMR. Examples are presented that\ndemonstrate the use of this method in a variety of cases relevant to materials\nscience: Eshelby inclusions, fracture, and microstructure evolution.

Starting from the Onsager reciprocal relations\ngenerally applicable to many physical processes, we present the derivation of\nthe Lorentz theorem and discuss other implications of reciprocity for\nelectromagnetic systems. Next, we identify all possible routes towards\nengineering nonreciprocal devices and analyze in detail three of them: Based on\nexternal bias, based on nonlinear and time-variant systems.

The magnet is at rest and contains electromagnetic momentum, but there\nwas no obvious mechanical momentum to balance this for momentum conservation.\nThey concluded that some sort of mechanical momentum, which they called \"hidden\nmomentum\", was contained in the magnet and ascribed this momentum to\nrelativistic effects, a contention that was apparently confirmed by Coleman and\nVan Vleck. Since then, a magnetic dipole in an electric field has been\nconsidered to have this new form of momentum, but this view ignores the\nelectromagnetic forces that arise when an electric field is applied to a magnet\nor a magnet is formed in an electric field. The electromagnetic forces result\nin the magnet gaining electromagnetic momentum and an equal and opposite amount\nof mechanical momentum so that it is moving in its original rest frame. This\nmoving reference frame is erroneously taken to be the rest frame in studies\nthat purport to show hidden momentum. Here I examine the analysis of Shockley\nand James and of Coleman and Van Vleck and consider a model of a magnetic\ndipole formed in a uniform electric field. These calculations show no hidden\nmomentum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jan 2020 23:55:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-20"}

In the latter case,\nobjective quality measures such as the mean squared error are typically\nemployed. However, it is well known that for image quality assessment, the\nactual quality experienced by the user cannot be fully deduced from such simple\nmeasures. Hence, we conducted a subjective quality assessment crowdscouring\nstudy for the interpolated frames provided by one of the optical flow\nbenchmarks, the Middlebury benchmark. We collected forced-choice paired\ncomparisons between interpolated images and corresponding ground truth. To\nincrease the sensitivity of observers when judging minute difference in paired\ncomparisons we introduced a new method to the field of full-reference quality\nassessment, called artefact amplification. From the crowdsourcing data, we\nreconstructed absolute quality scale values according to Thurstone's model. As\na result, we obtained a re-ranking of the 155 participating algorithms w.r.t.\nthe visual quality of the interpolated frames. This re-ranking not only shows\nthe necessity of visual quality assessment as another evaluation metric for\noptical flow and frame interpolation benchmarks, the results also provide the\nground truth for designing novel image quality assessment (IQA) methods\ndedicated to perceptual quality of interpolated images. As a first step, we\nproposed such a new full-reference method, called WAE-IQA. By weighing the\nlocal differences between an interpolated image and its ground truth WAE-IQA\nperformed slightly better than the currently best FR-IQA approach from the\nliterature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jan 2020 18:20:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Apr 2020 19:06:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-18"}

Optical Flow Control (OFC) protocol has been developed to\nprevent packet losses at switch sides caused by packet contentions.Based on the\ncollected resource topology of data plane, the optical network slices can be\ndynamically provisioned and automatically reconfigured by the SDN control\nplane. Meanwhile, experimental results validate that the priority assignment of\napplication flows supplies dynamic QoS performance to various slices running\napplications with specific requirements in terms of packet loss and\ntransmission latency. In addition, the capability of exposing traffic\nstatistics information of data plane to SDN control plane enables the\nimplementation of load balancing algorithms further improving the network\nperformance with high QoS. No packet loss and less than 4.8 us server-to-server\nlatency can be guaranteed for the sliced network with highest priority at a\nload of 0.5.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jan 2020 16:56:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

CSO is a robust and powerful metaheuristic\nswarm-based optimization approach that has received very positive feedback\nsince its emergence. It has been tackling many optimization problems and many\nvariants of it have been introduced. However, the literature lacks a detailed\nsurvey or a performance evaluation in this regard. Therefore, this paper is an\nattempt to review all these works, including its developments and applications,\nand group them accordingly. In addition, CSO is tested on 23 classical\nbenchmark functions and 10 modern benchmark functions (CEC 2019). The results\nare then compared against three novel and powerful optimization algorithms,\nnamely Dragonfly algorithm (DA), Butterfly optimization algorithm (BOA) and\nFitness Dependent Optimizer (FDO). These algorithms are then ranked according\nto Friedman test and the results show that CSO ranks first on the whole.\nFinally, statistical approaches are employed to further confirm the\noutperformance of CSO algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jan 2020 18:18:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-03"}
