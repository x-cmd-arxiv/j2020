The wine sector deserves special attention to investigate\nfirms' investment behavior given the high competition imposed by the\nlatecomers. More precisely, we investigate how the capitalization, liquidity\nand profitability influence the investment dynamics using firm-level data from\nthe wine industry from France (331 firms), Italy (335) firms and Spain (442)\nfirms. We use data from 2007 to 2014, drawing a comparison between these\ncountries, and relying on difference-and system-GMM estimators. Specifically,\nthe impact of profitability is positive and significant, while the\ncapitalization has a significant and negative impact on the investment dynamics\nonly in France and Spain. The influence of the liquidity ratio is negative and\nsignificant only in the case of Spain. Therefore, we notice different\ninvestment strategies for wine companies located in the largest producer\ncountries. It appears that these findings are in general robust to different\nspecifications of liquidity and profitability ratios, and to the different\nestimators we use.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jan 2020 16:08:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-29"}

When the interactions\nare short-ranged, two vastly different ground states exist: a polaron\nquasiparticle and a molecule dressed by the majority atoms. In the\nsingle-impurity limit, it is predicted that at a critical interaction strength,\na first-order transition occurs between these two states.

Here, we address this question experimentally and theoretically. Our\nexperiments are performed with a spin-imbalanced ultracold Fermi gas with\ntunable interactions. Utilizing a novel Raman spectroscopy combined with a\nhigh-sensitivity fluorescence detection technique, we isolate the quasiparticle\ncontribution and extract the polaron energy, spectral weight, and the contact\nparameter. As the interaction strength is increased, we observe a continuous\nvariation of all observables, in particular a smooth reduction of the\nquasiparticle weight as it goes to zero beyond the transition point. Our\nobservation is in good agreement with a theoretical model where polaron and\nmolecule quasiparticle states are thermally occupied according to their quantum\nstatistics. At the experimental conditions, polaron states are hence populated\neven at interactions where the molecule is the ground state and vice versa.

The magnetic field at the light cylinder radius is relatively high which\ncan accommodate both young Crab-like systems and old millisecond pulsars\naddressing the diverse environments of FRBs. At the first stage, the intense\npulsed-beam passing through the background plasma causes instabilities such\nthat the trapped particles in local Buneman-type cavitons saturate the local\nfield. The beam is then radially self-focused due to the circular electric\nfield developed by the two-stream instability which leads to Weibel instability\nin the transverse direction.

Using two-dimensional\nsimulations we validated the analytical estimates and studied the resulting\natmospheric response (Syntelis et al. 2019). In the present work, we set up\nthree-dimensional resistive MHD simulations of two cancelling polarities in a\nstratified atmosphere with a horizontal external field to further validate and\nimprove upon the analytical estimates. The computational evaluation of the\nparameters associated with the energy release are in good qualitative agreement\nwith the analytical estimates. The computational Poynting energy flux into the\ncurrent sheet is in good qualitative agreement with the analytical estimates,\nafter correcting the analytical expression to better account for the horizontal\nextent of the current sheet. The atmospheric response to the cancellation is\nthe formation of hot ejections, cool ejections, or a combination of both hot\nand cool ejections, which can appear with a time difference and/or be spatially\noffset, depending on the properties of the cancelling region and the resulting\nheight of the reconnection. Therefore, during the cancellation, a wide spectrum\nof ejections can be formed, which can account for the variety of multi-thermal\nejections associated with Ellerman bombs, UV bursts and IRIS bombs, and also\nother ejections associated with small-scale cancelling regions and spicules.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jan 2020 16:38:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-11"}

However, these gases may be challenging\nto detect together in the planetary atmospheres because photochemical oxygen\nradicals destroy methane. Previous work has shown that the photochemical\nlifetime of methane in oxygenated atmospheres is longer around M dwarfs, but M\ndwarf planet habitability may be hindered by extreme stellar activity and\nevolution. Here, we use a 1-D photochemical-climate model to show that K dwarf\nstars also offer a longer photochemical lifetime of methane in the presence of\noxygen compared to G dwarfs. For example, we show that a planet orbiting a K6V\nstar can support about an order of magnitude more methane in its atmosphere\ncompared to an equivalent planet orbiting a G2V star. In the reflected light\nspectra of worlds orbiting K dwarf stars, strong oxygen and methane features\ncould be observed at visible and near-infrared wavelengths. Because K dwarfs\nare dimmer than G dwarfs, they offer a better planet-star contrast ratio,\nenhancing the signal-to-noise (SNR) possible in a given observation. For\ninstance, a 50 hour observation of a planet at 7 pc with a 15-m telescope\nyields SNR = 9.2 near 1 um for a planet orbiting a solar-type G2V star, and SNR\n= 20 for the same planet orbiting a K6V star.

However, the predictions of such studies have not been experimentally\nexplored yet. In this work, we study the structural transformations undergone\nby tetravalent nematic liquid crystal shells under a strong uniform magnetic\nfield, using both experiments and simulations. We consider two different cases\nin terms of shell geometry and initial defect symmetry: i) homogeneous shells\nwith four s = +1/2 defects in a tetrahedral arrangement, and ii) inhomogeneous\nshells with four s = +1/2 defects localized in their thinner parts.\nConsistently with previous theoretical results, we observe that the initial\ndefect structure evolves into a bipolar one, in a process where the defects\nmigrate towards the poles. Interestingly, we find that the defect trajectories\nand dynamics are controlled by curvature walls that connect the defects by\npairs. Based on the angle between Bs, the local projection of the magnetic\nfield on the shell surface, and n+ 1/2 , a vector describing the defect\norientations, we are able to predict the nature and shape of those inversion\nwalls, and therefore, the trajectory and dynamics of the defects. This rule,\nbased on symmetry arguments, is consistent with both experiments and\nsimulations and applies for shells that are either homogeneous or inhomogeneous\nin thickness. By modifying the angle between Bs and n+1/2, we are able to\ninduce, in controlled way, complex routes towards the final bipolar state. In\nthe case of inhomogeneous shells, the specific symmetry of the shell allowed us\nto observe a hybrid splay-bend Helfrich wall for the first time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jan 2020 17:17:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-29"}

The frequency and the mode shape of the PVC are\nextracted and a very good agreement with the theoretical prediction by global\nlinear stability analysis (LSA) is found. By employing an adjoint LSA, it is\nfound that the PVC is particularly receptive inside the duct upstream of the\nswirling jet.

The actuation is shown to have the strongest effect close to the exit\nof the duct. There, frequency synchronization is reached primarily through\ndirect mode-to-mode interaction. Applying the actuation farther upstream,\nsynchronization is only achieved by a modification of the mean flow that\nmanipulates the swirl number. These experimental observations match\nqualitatively well with the theoretical receptivity derived from adjoint LSA.\nAlthough the process of synchronization is very complex, it is concluded that\nadjoint LSA based on mean field theory sufficiently predicts regions of high\nand low receptivity.

The Data Processing Inequality ensures that the\nmonotonicity axiom is satisfied. Additional, two other proposed axioms are\nsatisfied: the identity property, and the left monotonicity axiom.

Most\nITPs support such extensions in the form of restrictive \"syntax sugar\"\nsubstitutions and other ad hoc mechanisms, which are too rudimentary to support\nmany desirable abstractions. As a result, libraries are littered with\nunnecessary redundancy. Tactic languages in these systems are plagued by a\nseemingly unrelated issue: accidental name capture, which often produces\nunexpected and counterintuitive behavior. We take ideas from the Scheme family\nof programming languages and solve these two problems simultaneously by\nproposing a novel hygienic macro system custom-built for ITPs.

These should resemble, more closely than similar\nstudies of single hydrogen-rich stars, the results of evolution in close binary\nsystems. The effects of varying the mass-loss rate and metallicity are\ncalculated using a simple semi-analytic approach to stellar evolution that is\ntuned to reproduce detailed numerical calculations. Though the total fraction\nof black holes made in stellar collapse events varies considerably with\nmetallicity, mass-loss rate, and mass cutoff, from 5$\\%$ to 30$\\%$, the shapes\nof their birth functions are very similar for all reasonable variations in\nthese quantities. Median neutron star masses are in the range 1.32 - 1.37\n$M_\\odot$ regardless of metallicity. The median black hole mass for solar\nmetallicity is typically 8 to 9 $M_\\odot$ if only initial helium cores below 40\n$M_\\odot$ (ZAMS mass less than 80 $M_\\odot$) are counted, and 9 - 13 $M_\\odot$,\nin most cases, if helium cores with initial masses up to 150 $M_\\odot$ (ZAMS\nmass less than 300 $M_\\odot$) contribute. As long as the mass-loss rate as a\nfunction of mass exhibits no strong non-linearities, the black hole birth\nfunction from 15 to 35 $M_\\odot$ has a slope that depends mostly on the initial\nmass function for main sequence stars. These findings imply the possibility of\nconstraining the initial mass function and the properties of mass loss in close\nbinaries using ongoing measurements of gravitational wave radiation.

However,\nthe band gaps width correlates strongly with the resonators' mass and volume,\nwhich limits their functionality in applications. Trampoline phenomena have\nbeen numerically and experimentally shown to broaden the operational frequency\nranges of two-dimensional, pillar-based metamaterials through perforation. In\nthis work, we demonstrate trampoline phenomena in lightweight and planar\nlattices consisting of arrays of Archimedean spirals in unit cells.\nSpiral-based metamaterials have been shown to support different band gap\nopening mechanisms, namely, Bragg-scattering, local resonances and inertia\namplification.

As part of an effort to\ncreate active learning materials on interferometry, we developed and tested a\nnew Lecture-Tutorial to help Astro 101 students learn about key properties of\nastronomical interferometers. This paper describes this new Lecture-Tutorial\nand presents evidence for its effectiveness from a study conducted with 266\nAstro 101 students at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jan 2020 18:58:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-15"}

Since secondary\ngas released from planetesimals is poor in H$_2$, it was thought that CO would\nquickly photodissociate never reaching the high levels observed around the\nmajority of A stars with bright debris discs. Kral et al. 2019 showed that\nneutral carbon produced by CO photodissociation can effectively shield CO and\npotentially explain the high CO masses around 9 A stars with bright debris\ndiscs. Here we present a new model that simulates the gas viscous evolution,\naccounting for carbon shielding and how the gas release rate decreases with\ntime as the planetesimal disc loses mass. We find that the present gas mass in\na system is highly dependant on its evolutionary path. Since gas is lost on\nlong timescales, it can retain a memory of the initial disc mass. Moreover, we\nfind that gas levels can be out of equilibrium and quickly evolving from a\nshielded onto an unshielded state. With this model, we build the first\npopulation synthesis of gas around A stars, which we use to constrain the disc\nviscosity. We find a good match with a high viscosity ($\\alpha\\sim0.1$),\nindicating that gas is lost on timescales $\\sim1-10$ Myr. Moreover, our model\nalso shows that high CO masses are not expected around FGK stars since their\nplanetesimal discs are born with lower masses, explaining why shielded discs\nare only found around A stars.

These observations have\nbeen theoretically justified recently by considering a position-dependent,\nstep-like spin-orbit coupling near end of the nanowire, which could arise due\nto the presence of tunnel gates in a standard tunneling conductance experiment.\nHere, we show that the window in parameter space where this phenomenology\noccurs is vanishingly small, when compared to the parameter region where\nMajorana oscillations increase in amplitude with the applied field.

Still, the conditions under which\nplanetesimal formation occurs remain unclear. For collapse to proceed, the\nself-gravity of an overdensity must overcome stellar tidal disruption on large\nscales and turbulent diffusion on small scales. Here, we relate the scales of\nstreaming and Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, which both regulate particle\ndensities on the scales of gravitational collapse, directly to planetesimal\nformation. We support our analytic findings by performing 3D hydrodynamical\nsimulations of streaming and Kelvin-Helmholtz instability and planetesimal\nformation.

The definition of landmarks, agent, and the measurements taken by agent\nfrom landmarks is rather broad here: landmarks can be visual objects, e.g.,\npoles along a road, with measurements being the size of landmark in a visual\nsensor mounted on a vehicle (agent), or they can be radio transmitters, e.g.,\nWiFi access points inside a building, with measurements being the Received\nSignal Strength (RSS) heard from them by a mobile device carried by a person\n(agent). The goal of the map estimation is then to find the positions of\nlandmarks up to a scale, rotation, and shift (i.e., the topological map of the\nlandmarks).

In particular, the ratio of super Earths to warm Jupiters\nformed at the ice line depend sensitively on the initial disk radius. Initial\ngas disk radii of $\\sim$50 AU results in the largest super Earth populations,\nwhile both larger and smaller disk sizes result in the ice line producing more\ngas giants near 1 AU.

All previous\nexperimental implementations of TFQKD have been done over optical channels with\nsymmetric losses.

Our result not only answers a remaining\nquestion posed by Liaw, Mehrabian, Plan and Vershynin in 2017, but also\ngeneralizes their work. We also develop a new Bernstein type inequality for\nsub-exponential random variables, and a new Hanson-Wright inequality for\nquadratic forms of sub-Gaussian random variables, in both cases improving the\nbounds in the sub-Gaussian regime under moment constraints. Finally, we\nillustrate popular applications such as Johnson-Lindenstrauss embeddings, null\nspace property for 0-1 matrices, randomized sketches and blind demodulation,\nwhose theoretical guarantees can be improved by our results (in the\nsub-Gaussian case).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jan 2020 23:06:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Jan 2021 21:30:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-22"}

While IoT networks have the potential to benefit our lives, they\ncreate privacy and security challenges not seen with traditional IT networks.\nDue to the lack of visibility, operators of such smart environments are not\noften aware of their IoT assets, let alone whether each IoT device is\nfunctioning properly safe from cyber-attacks. This thesis is the culmination of\nour efforts to develop techniques to profile the network behavioral pattern of\nIoTs, automate IoT classification, deduce their operating context, and detect\nanomalous behavior indicative of cyber-attacks.\n  We begin this thesis by surveying IoT ecosystem, while reviewing current\napproaches to vulnerability assessments, intrusion detection, and behavioral\nmonitoring. For our first contribution, we collect traffic traces and\ncharacterize the network behavior of IoT devices via attributes from traffic\npatterns. We develop a robust machine learning-based inference engine trained\nwith these attributes and demonstrate real-time classification of 28 IoT\ndevices with over 99% accuracy. Our second contribution enhances the\nclassification by reducing the cost of attribute extraction while also\nidentifying IoT device states. Prototype implementation and evaluation\ndemonstrate the ability of our supervised machine learning method to detect\nbehavioral changes for five IoT devices. Our third and final contribution\ndevelops a modularized unsupervised inference engine that dynamically\naccommodates the addition of new IoT devices and/or updates to existing ones,\nwithout requiring system-wide retraining of the model. We demonstrate via\nexperiments that our model can automatically detect attacks and firmware\nchanges in ten IoT devices with over 94% accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jan 2020 23:13:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-30"}

It is one of the most prominent protocols for the\nrandom assignment problem. However, Probabilistic Serial is not\nincentive-compatible, thereby these desirable properties only hold for the\nagents' declared preferences, rather than their genuine preferences. A\nsubstantial utility gain through strategic behaviors would trigger\nself-interested agents to manipulate the mechanism and would subvert the very\nfoundation of adopting the mechanism in practice. In this paper, we\ncharacterize the extent to which an individual agent can increase its utility\nby strategic manipulation. We show that the incentive ratio of the mechanism is\n$\\frac{3}{2}$. That is, no agent can misreport its preferences such that its\nutility becomes more than 1.5 times of what it is when reports truthfully. This\nratio is a worst-case guarantee by allowing an agent to have complete\ninformation about other agents' reports and to figure out the best response\nstrategy even if it is computationally intractable in general. To complement\nthis worst-case study, we further evaluate an agent's utility gain on average\nby experiments. The experiments show that an agent' incentive in manipulating\nthe rule is very limited. These results shed some light on the robustness of\nProbabilistic Serial against strategic manipulation, which is one step further\nthan knowing that it is not incentive-compatible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 28 Jan 2020 23:53:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-30"}

The lack of understanding about factors contributing success\nof these attacks motivates the need for modelling membership information\nleakage using information theory and for investigating properties of machine\nlearning models and training algorithms that can reduce membership information\nleakage. We use conditional mutual information leakage to measure the amount of\ninformation leakage from the trained machine learning model about the presence\nof an individual in the training dataset. We devise an upper bound for this\nmeasure of information leakage using Kullback--Leibler divergence that is more\namenable to numerical computation. We prove a direct relationship between the\nKullback--Leibler membership information leakage and the probability of success\nfor a hypothesis-testing adversary examining whether a particular data record\nbelongs to the training dataset of a machine learning model. We show that the\nmutual information leakage is a decreasing function of the training dataset\nsize and the regularization weight.

Evolving it to high-fidelity {\\em digital twin} is desirable for\nthe management and operations of large-scale data centers. Manually calibrating\nCFD model parameters to achieve twin-class fidelity by specially trained domain\nexpert is tedious and labor-intensive. To reduce manual efforts, existing\nautomatic calibration approaches developed for various computational models\napply heuristics to search model configurations within an empirically defined\nparameter bound. However, in the context of CFD, each search step requires\nlong-lasting CFD model's iterated solving, rendering these approaches\nimpractical with increased model complexity. This paper presents Kalibre, a\nknowledge-based neural surrogate approach that performs CFD model calibration\nby iterating four key steps of i) training a neural surrogate model based on\nCFD-generated data, ii) finding the optimal parameters at the moment through\nneural surrogate retraining based on sensor-measured data, iii) configuring the\nfound parameters back to the CFD model, and iv) validating the CFD model using\nsensor-measured data as the ground truth. Thus, the parameter search is\noffloaded to the neural surrogate which is ultra-faster than CFD model's\niterated solving. To speed up the convergence of Kalibre, we integrate prior\nknowledge of the twinned data center's thermophysics into the neural surrogate\ndesign to improve its learning efficiency.

Such corrections must be handled\ncarefully to have a well defined perturbative scheme, and this can be achieved\nthrough the method of perturbative constraints, where the coefficient of the\nadditional term in the action is used as expansion parameter for the quantities\nof interest. In this work, we implement a perturbative framework that compares\nsolutions in modified theories of gravity with solutions of the Einstein field\nequations, by following the guidelines of perturbation theory constructed in\nGeneral Relativity together with the perturbative constraints rationale. By\nusing this formalism, we demonstrate that a consistent $f(R)$ perturbation\ntheory in vacuum, for an important class of $f(R)$ functions, produces no\nadditional effects with respect to what is expected from the perturbation\ntheory of General Relativity. From this result, we argue that there are\nfundamental limitations that explain why the solutions of some $f(R)$ models\ncan be disconnected from their general relativistic counterparts, in the sense\nthat the limit that leads from the $f(R)$ action to General Relativity does not\ntransform the solutions accordingly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jan 2020 03:45:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Mar 2020 23:06:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-18"}

Thus they can complement the 3D geometry provided by point\nclouds. Yet how to effectively use image information to assist point cloud\nbased detection is still an open question. In this work, we build on top of\nVoteNet and propose a 3D detection architecture called ImVoteNet specialized\nfor RGB-D scenes. ImVoteNet is based on fusing 2D votes in images and 3D votes\nin point clouds. Compared to prior work on multi-modal detection, we explicitly\nextract both geometric and semantic features from the 2D images. We leverage\ncamera parameters to lift these features to 3D. To improve the synergy of 2D-3D\nfeature fusion, we also propose a multi-tower training scheme.

The\nrelation between the two and the one dimensional scattering lengths as well as\nthe Tan contacts is established. The contact, capturing the two-body short\nrange correlations, shows an increasing tendency for a larger anisotropy.\nSubsequently, the interaction quench dynamics from attractive to repulsive\nvalues and vice versa is investigated for various anisotropies. A closed\nanalytical form of the expansion coefficients of the two-body wavefunction,\nduring the time evolution is constructed. The response of the system is studied\nby means of the time-averaged fidelity, the spectra of the spatial extent of\nthe cloud in each direction and the one-body density.

In this framework, the huge diversity gain associated with the large-scale\nantenna array in massive MIMO systems is leveraged to ensure ultrahigh\nreliability. To reduce the overhead and latency induced by the channel\nestimation process, we advocate the noncoherent communication technique which\ndoes not need the knowledge of instantaneous channel state information (CSI)\nbut only depends on the large-scale fading coefficients for information\ndecoding. To boost the scalability of the system considered, we enable the\nnon-orthogonal channel access of multiple users by devising a new differential\nmodulation scheme to assure that each transmitted signal matrix can be uniquely\ndetermined in the noise-free case and be reliably estimated in noisy cases when\nthe antenna array size is scaled up. The key idea is to make the transmitted\nsignals from multiple users be superimposed properly over the air such that\nwhen the sum-signal is correctly detected, the signals sent by all users can be\nuniquely determined. To further improve the average error performance when the\narray antenna number is large, we propose a max-min Kullback-Leibler (KL)\ndivergence-based design by jointly optimizing the transmitted powers of all\nusers and the sub-constellation assignment among them. Simulation results show\nthat the proposed design significantly outperforms the existing max-min\nEuclidean distance-based counterpart in terms of error performance.

The cross section of Thomson scattering is significantly enhanced for the\nscattering photons. 2. On the other hand, because of the nonlinear plasma\nproperties in strong waves, the near-source plasma is more transparent and has\na smaller effective dispersion measure (DM) contribution to the observed value.\nFor a repeating FRB source, the brighter bursts would have somewhat smaller DMs\ncontributed by the near-source plasma. 3. The radiation beam undergoes\nrelativistic self-focusing in a dense plasma, the degree of self-focusing (or\nsqueezing) depends on the plasma density. Such a squeezing effect would affect\nthe collimation angle and the true event rate of FRBs. 4. When an FRB\npropagates in a nearby ambient plasma, a wakefield wave in the plasma will be\ngenerated by the ponderomotive force of the FRB and accelerates electrons in\nthe ambient medium. However, such an effect is too weak to be observationally\ninteresting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jan 2020 11:09:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Mar 2020 03:45:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-01"}

By tracking individual microbubbles, the\nvelocity and flow within microvessels can be estimated. However, a 2D\nsuper-resolution image can only localize bubbles with sub-wavelength resolution\nin the imaging plane whereas the resolution in the elevation plane is limited\nby conventional beamwidth physics. Since ultrasound imaging integrates echoes\nover the elevation dimension, velocity estimates at a single location in the\nimaging plane include information throughout the imaging slice thickness. This\nslice thickness is typically a few orders or magnitude larger than the\nsuper-resolution limit. It is shown here that in order to estimate the\nvelocity, a spatial integration over the elevation direction must be\nconsidered. This operation yields a multiplicative correction factor that\ncompensates for the elevation integration. A correlation-based velocity\nestimation technique is then presented.

The kinetic equation of the model is solved\nnumerically using the finite difference method. The model is used to analyze\nthe FLASH effect with the oxygen depletion hypothesis, and the brain tissue is\nchosen as an example.

This process continues until the LO\noscillator strength is so high that all other phonons are inverted and form\nLO-TO pairs within the outer TO-LO mode pair of the plasmon or plasmon-like\nmode. These insights can be readily transferred to other semiconductors or many\nmode materials with reststrahlen bands and allow simple mode assignments. These\nmode assignments will help to understand the nature of surface modes of\nstructured layers of these materials for application of surface plasmon\npolariton and surface phonon polaritons based metamaterials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jan 2020 13:13:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-24"}

On the one hand, when system and environment are both inherently\nmultipartite, initial correlations between the parties of the composite\nenvironment make the dynamical map non-local, despite of local nature of the\ninteraction between each party of the system and the environment. On the other\nhand, initial correlations between the open system and its environment prevents\none from defining a completely positive dynamical map. Recently, dephasing\ndynamics of photons has been used in both of these frameworks - theoretically\nand experimentally - to demonstrate some fundamental and applicable aspects of\nopen system dynamics and memory effects. However, the earlier studies in this\ncontext are often based solely on the concept of decoherence functions.\nTherefore, we still lack explicit master equation descriptions for dynamics\ninduced by correlated composite initial environmental states. Also, a detailed\nunderstanding how initial system-environment correlations influence qubit\ndynamics in the photonic context is missing. In this paper, we derive generic\nmaster equations for the reduced dephasing dynamics of the two-photon\npolarization state when the bipartite environmental frequency degrees of\nfreedom are initially correlated. We thereby show the explicit dependence of\nthe operator form and the decay rates of the master equation on the initial\nfrequency correlations and the influence of various types of frequency\ndistributions. Furthermore, we use recently developed bath positive\ndecomposition method to treat initially correlated polarization-frequency state\nof a photon, and demonstrate how this allows new insight and detailed\ninformation on how the contributions of different origin influence the photonic\ndephasing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jan 2020 13:17:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-06"}

To this end,\nwe introduce the tensor 1x1 convolutional layer by imposing high-order tensor\n(outer) product, by which we not only harmonize the heterogeneous features but\nalso take additional non-linearity into account. To avoid the unacceptable\nkernel size resulted from the tensor product, we construct the kernels with\ntensor network decomposition, which is able to convert the exponential growth\nof the dimension to linear growth. Armed with the new layer, we propose\nHigh-order OWAN for multi-distorted image restoration.

Secondly,\nthe Min-Regret Sum Algorithm finds a min-regret sum stable matching in $O(d_s\nm)$ time, where $d_s$ is the difference in the ranks between a worst-off man in\neach of the woman-optimal and man-optimal stable matchings. Experiments to\ncompare several types of fair optimal stable matchings were conducted and show\nthat the Regret-Equal Degree Iteration Algorithm produces matchings that are\ncompetitive with respect to other fairness objectives. On the other hand,\nexisting types of \"fair\" stable matchings did not provide as close an\napproximation to regret-equal stable matchings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jan 2020 14:54:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 1 Apr 2020 07:53:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 9 Apr 2020 13:38:36 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 10 Apr 2020 16:03:10 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 16 Apr 2020 13:19:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-17"}

A fundamental test for its significance in the solar\ndynamo is to look for magnetic helicity of opposite signs in the two\nhemispheres, and at small and large scales. However, measuring magnetic\nhelicity is compromised by the inability to fully infer the magnetic field\nvector from observations of solar spectra, caused by what is known as the \"pi\nambiguity\" of spectropolarimetric observations. We decompose linear\npolarisation into parity-even and parity-odd E and B polarisations, which are\nnot affected by the \"pi ambiguity\". Furthermore, we study whether the\ncorrelations of spatial Fourier spectra of B and parity-even quantities such as\nE or temperature T are a robust proxy for magnetic helicity of solar magnetic\nfields. We analyse polarisation measurements of active regions observed by the\nHelioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board the Solar Dynamics observatory.\nTheory predicts the magnetic helicity of active regions to have, statistically,\nopposite signs in the two hemispheres. We then compute the parity-odd E B and T\nB correlations, and test for systematic preference of their sign based on the\nhemisphere of the active regions. We find that: (i) E B and T B correlations\nare a reliable proxy for magnetic helicity, when computed from linear\npolarisation measurements away from spectral line cores, and (ii) E\npolarisation reverses its sign close to the line core. Our analysis reveals\nFaraday rotation to not have a significant influence on the computed parity-odd\ncorrelations.

We found that chromospheric\nactivity levels of the studied systems show various changes during the orbital\nrevolution: we see either flat, or one-peaked, or two-peaked distributions of\nequivalent width vs. the orbital phase. The first case means that the activity\nlevel is probably constant, while the latter two cases suggest the presence of\none or two active longitudes at the stellar surfaces.

Probabilistic tractable models have also recently\nemerged, which guarantee that conditional marginals can be computed in time\nlinear in the size of the model, where the model is usually learned from data.\nAlthough initially limited to low tree-width models, recent tractable models\nsuch as sum product networks (SPNs) and probabilistic sentential decision\ndiagrams (PSDDs) exploit efficient function representations and also capture\nhigh tree-width models.\n  In this paper, we ask the following technical question: can we use the\ndistributions represented or learned by these models to perform causal queries,\nsuch as reasoning about interventions and counterfactuals? By appealing to some\nexisting ideas on transforming such models to Bayesian networks, we answer\nmostly in the negative. We show that when transforming SPNs to a causal graph\ninterventional reasoning reduces to computing marginal distributions; in other\nwords, only trivial causal reasoning is possible.

The performance of current scoring systems assessing the severity of\nMODS and its mortality remains unsatisfactory. This study aims to develop an\ninterpretable and generalizable model for early mortality prediction in elderly\npatients with MODS. Methods: The MIMIC-III, eICU-CRD and PLAGH-S databases were\nemployed for model generation and evaluation. We used the eXtreme Gradient\nBoosting model with the SHapley Additive exPlanations method to conduct early\nand interpretable predictions of patients' hospital outcome.

The performances of the model in predicting hospital mortality\nas validated by the three datasets were: AUC of 0.858, sensitivity of 0.834 and\nspecificity of 0.705; AUC of 0.849, sensitivity of 0.763 and specificity of\n0.784; and AUC of 0.838, sensitivity of 0.882 and specificity of 0.691,\nrespectively.

Our discussion is based on the concept of propositional\nsentences consisting of \\textit{subject-predicate-object} (SPO) triples for\nexpressing elementary facts. SPO sentences are the basis for most natural\nlanguages but might also be important for explicit perception and declarative\nmemories, as well as intra-brain communication and the ability to argue and\nreason. A set of SPO sentences can be described as a knowledge graph, which can\nbe transformed into an adjacency tensor. We introduce tensor models, where\nconcepts have dual representations as indices and associated embeddings, two\nconstructs we believe are essential for the understanding of implicit and\nexplicit perception and memory in the brain. We argue that a biological\nrealization of perception and memory imposes constraints on information\nprocessing. In particular, we propose that explicit perception and declarative\nmemories require a semantic decoder, which, in a simple realization, is based\non four layers: First, a sensory memory layer, as a buffer for sensory input,\nsecond, an index layer representing concepts, third, a memoryless\nrepresentation layer for the broadcasting of information ---the \"blackboard\",\nor the \"canvas\" of the brain--- and fourth, a working memory layer as a\nprocessing center and data buffer. We discuss the operations of the four layers\nand relate them to the global workspace theory. In a Bayesian brain\ninterpretation, semantic memory defines the prior for observable triple\nstatements.

The\nnumerical calculation is based on the simulation results performed on two types\nof liquids, fragile liquids and strong liquids. The numerical solutions are\nthen shown to be uniquely determined by the long-time collective diffusion\ncoefficient $D(q_m)$, where $q_m$ is a first peak position of a static\nstructure factor for a whole system. It is confirmed based on four different\nsimulation results that the supercooled state consists of two substates, a\nweakly supercooled state in which the nonlinear parameter $\\mu$ in the memory\nfunction increases as $D$ decreases and a deeply supercooled state in which\n$\\mu$ becomes constant up to the glass transition.

Hence there exists such a universality\nthat there is only one solution for different liquids of a same type at a given\nvalue of $D$.

For such a centralized\ncell-free network with static predefined beamforming design, we first derive a\nclosed-form expression of the uplink per-user probability of outage. To\nsignificantly reduce the complexity of joint processing of users' signals in\npresence of a large number of devices and APs, we propose a novel dynamic\ncell-free network architecture. In this architecture, the distributed APs are\npartitioned (i.e. clustered) among a set of subgroups with each subgroup acting\nas a virtual AP equipped with a distributed antenna system (DAS). The\nconventional static cell-free network is a special case of this dynamic\ncell-free network when the cluster size is one. For this dynamic cell-free\nnetwork, we propose a successive interference cancellation (SIC)-enabled signal\ndetection method and an inter-user-interference (IUI)-aware DAS's receive\ndiversity combining scheme. We then formulate the general problem of clustering\nAPs and designing the beamforming vectors with an objective to maximizing the\nsum rate or maximizing the minimum rate. To this end, we propose a hybrid deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL) model, namely, a deep deterministic policy\ngradient (DDPG)-deep double Q-network (DDQN) model, to solve the optimization\nproblem for online implementation with low complexity. The DRL model for\nsum-rate optimization significantly outperforms that for maximizing the minimum\nrate in terms of average per-user rate performance. Also, in our system\nsetting, the proposed DDPG-DDQN scheme is found to achieve around $78\\%$ of the\nrate achievable through an exhaustive search-based design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 29 Jan 2020 03:00:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Feb 2020 04:49:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-25"}

Traditionally, ILI surveillance data is updated weekly and provided at\na spatially coarse resolution. Producing timely and reliable high-resolution\nspatiotemporal forecasts for ILI is crucial for local preparedness and optimal\ninterventions. We present TDEFSI (Theory Guided Deep Learning Based Epidemic\nForecasting with Synthetic Information), an epidemic forecasting framework that\nintegrates the strengths of deep neural networks and high-resolution\nsimulations of epidemic processes over networks. TDEFSI yields accurate\nhigh-resolution spatiotemporal forecasts using low-resolution time series data.\nDuring the training phase, TDEFSI uses high-resolution simulations of epidemics\nthat explicitly model spatial and social heterogeneity inherent in urban\nregions as one component of training data. We train a two-branch recurrent\nneural network model to take both within-season and between-season\nlow-resolution observations as features, and output high-resolution detailed\nforecasts. The resulting forecasts are not just driven by observed data but\nalso capture the intricate social, demographic and geographic attributes of\nspecific urban regions and mathematical theories of disease propagation over\nnetworks. We focus on forecasting the incidence of ILI and evaluate TDEFSI's\nperformance using synthetic and real-world testing datasets at the state and\ncounty levels in the USA. The results show that, at the state level, our method\nachieves comparable/better performance than several state-of-the-art methods.\nAt the county level, TDEFSI outperforms the other methods.

However,\nlong-distance travel withEV is not possible yet without making multiple halt at\nEV charging stations. Many remote regions do not have charging stations, and\neven if they are present, it can take several hours to recharge the battery.\nConversely, ICE vehicle fueling stations are much more prevalent, and\nre-fueling takes a couple of minutes. These facts have deterred many from\nmoving to EVs. Existing solutions to these problems, such as building more\ncharging stations, increasing battery capacity, and road-charging have not been\nproven efficient so far. In this paper, we propose Peer-to-Peer Car Charging\n(P2C2), a highly scalable novel technique for charging EVs on the go with\nminimal cost overhead. We allow EVs to share charge among each others based on\nthe instructions from a cloud-based control system. The control system assigns\nand guides EVs for charge sharing. We also introduce mobile Charging Stations\n(MoCS), which are high battery capacity vehicles that are used to replenish the\noverall charge in the vehicle networks.
