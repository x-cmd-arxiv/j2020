The HARPS spectrograph provides state-of-the-art stellar radial\nvelocity (RV) measurements with a precision down to 1 m/s. The spectra are\nextracted with a dedicated data-reduction software (DRS) and the RVs are\ncomputed by CCF with a numerical mask. Aims. The aim of this study is\nthree-fold: (i) Create easy access to the public HARPS RV data set. (ii) Apply\nthe new public SERVAL pipeline to the spectra, and produce a more precise RV\ndata set. (iii) Check whether the precision of the RVs can be further improved\nby correcting for small nightly systematic effects. Methods. For each star\nobserved with HARPS, we downloaded the publicly available spectra from the ESO\narchive and recomputed the RVs with SERVAL. We then computed nightly zero\npoints (NZPs) by averaging the RVs of quiet stars. Results. Analysing the RVs\nof the most RV-quiet stars, whose RV scatter is < 5 m/s, we find that SERVAL\nRVs are on average more precise than DRS RVs by a few percent. We find three\nsignificant systematic effects, whose magnitude is independent of the software\nused for the RV derivation: (i) stochastic variations with a magnitude of 1\nm/s; (ii) long-term variations, with a magnitude of 1 m/s and a typical\ntimescale of a few weeks; and (iii) 20-30 NZPs significantly deviating by a few\nm/s. In addition, we find small (< 1 m/s) but significant intra-night drifts in\nDRS RVs before the 2015 intervention, and in SERVAL RVs after it. We confirm\nthat the fibre exchange in 2015 caused a discontinuous RV jump, which strongly\ndepends on the spectral type of the observed star: from 14 m/s for late F-type\nstars, to -3 m/s for M dwarfs. Conclusions. Our NZP-corrected SERVAL RVs can be\nretrieved from a user-friendly, public database. It provides more than 212 000\nRVs for about 3000 stars along with many auxiliary information, NZP\ncorrections, various activity indices, and DRS-CCF products.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jan 2020 17:06:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

In this work, PeLECs utilizing an optimized\nfraction of LiPF6 salt additive exhibit enhanced stability. At 0.5 wt% LiPF6,\ndevices exhibit 100 h operation at high brightness in excess of 800 cd/m2 under\nconstant current driving, achieving a maximum luminance of 3260 cd/m2 and power\nefficiency of 9.1 Lm/W. This performance extrapolates to a 6700 h luminance\nhalf-life from 100 cd/m2, a 5.6-fold improvement over devices with no lithium\nsalt additive. Analysis under constant voltage driving reveals three current\nregimes, with lithium addition strongly enhancing current in the second and\nthird regimes. The third regime correlates degradation of luminance with\ndecreased current. These losses are mitigated by LiPF6 addition, an effect\npostulated to arise from preservation of perovskite structure. To further\nunderstand lithium salt addition, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy with\nequivalent circuit modeling is performed. Electrical double layer widths from\nionic redistribution are minimized at 0.5wt% LiPF6 and inversely correlate with\nefficient performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jan 2020 17:22:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-17"}

Blind Source Separation (BSS) provides a powerful approach to address\nsuch problems. However, BSS algorithms typically treat all sources equally and\ndo not resolve uncertainty regarding the ordering of the separated signals at\nthe output of the algorithm, i.e., the outer permutation problem. This paper\naddresses this problem by incorporating prior knowledge into the adaptation of\nthe demixing filters, e.g., the position of the sources, in a Bayesian\nframework. We focus here on methods based on Independent Vector Analysis (IVA)\nas it elegantly and successfully deals with the internal permutation problem.\nBy including a background model, i.e., a model for sources we are not\ninterested to separate, we enable the algorithm to extract the sources of\ninterest in overdetermined and underdetermined scenarios at a low computational\ncomplexity. The proposed framework allows to incorporate prior knowledge about\nthe demixing filters in a generic way and unifies several known and newly\nproposed algorithms using a Bayesian view.

Yet they\nfall short when it comes to generating actionable insights for urban design. To\nsupport urban interventions, one needs to go beyond predicting beauty, and\ntackle the challenge of recreating beauty. Unfortunately, deep learning\ntechniques have not been designed with that challenge in mind. Given their\n\"black-box nature\", these models cannot be directly used to explain why a\nparticular urban scene is deemed to be beautiful. To partly fix that, we\npropose a deep learning framework called Facelift, that is able to both\nbeautify existing urban scenes (Google Street views) and explain which urban\nelements make those transformed scenes beautiful. To quantitatively evaluate\nour framework, we cannot resort to any existing metric (as the research problem\nat hand has never been tackled before) and need to formulate new ones.

Upon a review of the urban planning literature, we identify\nfive main metrics: walkability, green spaces, openness, landmarks and visual\ncomplexity.

The major drawback of this approach is that computation\nof only a few structural features has been implemented so far, and it is\ndifficult to tell a priori which features are important for a particular\napplication. The latter problem has been empirically observed for predictors of\nguest uptake in nanoporous materials: local and global porosity features become\ndominant descriptors at low and high pressures, respectively.

In addition, Trotter error caused by noncommuting terms can\naccumulate and harm the overall circuit fidelity, thus causing algorithmic\nerrors. In this paper, we propose a new term ordering strategy, max-commute-tsp\n(MCTSP), that simultaneously mitigates both algorithmic and physical errors.\nFirst, we improve the Trotter fidelity compared with previously proposed\noptimization by reordering Pauli terms and partitioning them into commuting\nfamilies. We demonstrate the practicality of this method by constructing and\nevaluating quantum circuits that simulate different molecular Hamiltonians,\ntogether with theoretical explanations for the fidelity improvements from our\nterm grouping method. Second, we describe a new gate cancellation technique\nthat reduces the high gate counts by formulating the gate cancellation problem\nas a travelling salesperson problem, together with benchmarking experiments.\nFinally, we also provide benchmarking results that demonstrate the combined\nadvantage of max-commute-tsp to mitigate both physical and algorithmic errors\nvia quantum circuit simulation under realistic noise models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jan 2020 18:33:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Jan 2020 06:15:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 12 Mar 2021 16:34:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-15"}

Both\nhave large pressure-like components which dominate the density terms. Using one\nform a simple model of the spiral galaxy halos is developed which can match the\nobserved `flat' outer rotation curves of some galaxies,including the Milky Way.\nIt can also represent the ascending outer rotational curves of small spiral\ngalaxies such as M33. See Figs. 1, 2. The halo dark matter (DM)`missing mass'\nresults from ignoring the pressure term's contribution to the source tensor.\n  The analysis of the Milky Way rotation curve gives parameters characterizing\nthe DM intergalactic medium in which the halo is situated.. The dark matter\ncannot come closer to the galactic center than $R \\sim 4$ kpc. It reaches a\nmaximum flux at $R_h \\simeq 8$ kpc and then falls rapidly with distance. It is\nhoped that by analyzing other galactic rotation curves these models can be used\nto infer properties of the intergalactic DM matter.\n  The other form for $T^{\\mu \\nu}$ for DM is useful in cosmology.

In this paper we\npresent a model of this process for the MW. A section of the Galactic disc is\nallowed to form stars which subsequently explode as supernovae (SNe) and send\ngas out into the hot halo. The gas that is sent out is colder than the hot halo\ngas and, as it mixes, the halo gas is cooled, providing fuel for further SF as\nthe mixture falls back onto the Galactic disc.

Although the effect is expected to be\ntiny, if these spacetime fluctuations grow over a large distance, the initial\nstate of a photon, such as its energy, is gradually washed out as the photon\npropagates. Thus, in these models, even the most monochromatic light source\nwould gradually disperse in energy due to spacetime fluctuations over large\ndistances. In this paper, we use science verification observations obtained\nwith ESPRESSO at the Very Large Telescope to place a novel bound on the growth\nof spacetime fluctuations. To achieve this, we directly measure the width of a\nnarrow Fe II absorption line produced by a quiescent gas cloud at redshift\nz=2.34, corresponding to a comoving distance of ~5.8 Gpc. Using a heuristic\nmodel where the energy fluctuations grow as sigma_E / E = (E/E_P)^alpha, where\nE_P = 1.22 x 10^28 eV is the Planck energy, we rule out models with alpha <\n0.634, including models where the quantum fluctuations grow as a random walk\nprocess (alpha = 0.5).

We constrain the galaxy halo connection using the\nstellar-mass-halo-mass relationship for two observed stellar mass functions,\nand the Illustris TNG stellar mass function. Furthermore, we also create a\nsuite of toy models where the stellar-mass-halo-mass relationship is manually\nchanged. For each stellar-mass-halo-mass relation the pair fraction, and its\nevolution, are generated. We find that enhancements to the number density of\nhigh mass galaxies cause steepening of the stellar-mass-halo mass relation,\nresulting in a reduction of the pair fraction. We argue this is a considerable\ncause of bias that must be accounted for when comparing pair fractions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jan 2020 19:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-07"}

Here we say that a framelet\ntransform is compact if it can be implemented by convolution using only\nfinitely supported filters. On the other hand, in sharp contrast to the\nextensively studied scalar framelets, multiframelets (a.k.a. vector framelets)\nderived through OEP from refinable vector functions are much less studied and\nare far from well understood. Also, most constructed multiframelets often lack\nbalancing property which reduces sparsity.

From any compactly\nsupported \\emph{refinable vector function having at least two entries}, we\nprove that we can always construct through OEP a compactly supported\nquasi-tight multiframelet such that (1) its associated discrete framelet\ntransform is compact and has the highest possible balancing order; (2) all\ncompactly supported framelet generators have the highest possible order of\nvanishing moments, matching the approximation/accuracy order of its underlying\nrefinable vector function. This result demonstrates great advantages of OEP for\nmultiframelets (retaining all the desired properties) over scalar framelets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jan 2020 19:11:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-20"}

Statistically, this entails the\nidentification of rare signal events buried in immense backgrounds that mimic\nthe properties of the former. In machine learning parlance, particle\nidentification represents a classification problem characterized by overlapping\nand imbalanced classes. Boosted decision trees (BDTs) have had tremendous\nsuccess in the particle identification domain but more recently have been\novershadowed by deep learning (DNNs) approaches. This work proposes an\nalgorithm to extract more out of standard boosted decision trees by targeting\ntheir main weakness, susceptibility to overfitting. This novel construction\nharnesses the meta-learning techniques of boosting and bagging simultaneously\nand performs remarkably well on the ATLAS Higgs (H) to tau-tau data set (ATLAS\net al., 2014) which was the subject of the 2014 Higgs ML Challenge\n(Adam-Bourdarios et al., 2015). While the decay of Higgs to a pair of tau\nleptons was established in 2018 (CMS collaboration et al., 2017) at the\n4.9$\\sigma$ significance based on the 2016 data taking period, the 2014 public\ndata set continues to serve as a benchmark data set to test the performance of\nsupervised classification schemes.

Observations from Parker Solar\nProbe provide a new opportunity to study this problem, as it measures the solar\nwind at unprecedented close distances to the Sun. During the 1st orbit, PSP\nencountered a large number of current sheets in the solar wind through\nperihelion at 35.7 solar radii. We performed a comprehensive survey of these\ncurrent sheets and found evidence for 21 reconnection exhausts. These exhausts\nwere observed in heliospheric current sheets, coronal mass ejections, and\nregular solar wind. However, we find that the majority of current sheets\nencountered around perihelion, where the magnetic field was strongest and\nplasma beta was lowest, were Alfv\\'enic structures associated with bursty\nradial jets and these current sheets did not appear to be undergoing local\nreconnection. We examined conditions around current sheets to address why some\ncurrent sheets reconnected, while others did not. A key difference appears to\nbe the degree of plasma velocity shear across the current sheets: The median\nvelocity shear for the 21 reconnection exhausts was 24% of the Alfv\\'en\nvelocity shear, whereas the median shear across 43 Alfv\\'enic current sheets\nexamined was 71% of the Alfv\\'en velocity shear.

With\nstandard assumptions for the energy densities of relativistic electrons going\ninto a power-law energy distribution, and the magnetic field strength\n(epsilon_e = epsilon_B = 0.1), we arrive at the upper limits on mass-loss rate\nfor the progenitor system of SN 2013dy (2016coj, 2018gv, 2018pv, 2019np), to be\nless than 12 (2.8,1.3, 2.1, 1.7)EE(-8) solar masses per year (for a wind speed\nof 100 km/s). To SNe 2016coj, 2018gv, 2018pv and 2019np we add radio data for\n17 other nearby SNe Ia, and model their non-detections. With the same model as\ndescribed, all 21 SNe Ia have mass-loss rates less than 4EE(-8) solar masses\nper year (for a wind speed of 100 km/s). We compare those limits with the\nexpected mass loss rates in different single-degenerate progenitor scenarios.\nWe also discuss how information on epsilon_e and epsilon_B can be obtained from\nlate observations of SNe Ia and the youngest SN Ia remnant detected in radio,\nG1.9+0.3, as well as stripped-envelope core-collapse SNe. We highlight SN\n2011dh, and argue for epsilon_e approximately equal to 0.1 and epsilon_B\napproximately equal to 0.0033. Finally, we discuss strategies to observe at\nradio frequencies to maximize the chance of detection, given the time since\nexplosion, the distance to the supernova and the telescope sensitivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jan 2020 21:04:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-04"}

Due to the weaknesses in sensor nodes,\nthey are vulnerable to many threats. One notable attack threating WSN is Denial\nof Sleep (DoS). DoS attacks denotes the loss of energy in these sensors by\nkeeping the nodes from going into sleep and energy-saving mode.

The two structures in the same family differ mainly by the\nratio of hexagons to octagons, where this ratio increases the 'flatness' of the\nstructures. Although the penetration depth values are higher in the 'flatter'\nstructures (P8bal and G8bal), the absorbed kinetic energy by them is\nconsiderably higher, which yields them a better energy-absorption performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jan 2020 21:54:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-20"}

The corrections responsible for the bounce\nare parameterized in a general way so as to remain agnostic about the specific\nmechanism of singularity resolution at play. It thus develops an effective\ntheory based on a thin shell approach, inferring generic properties of such a\nUV complete gravitational collapse. The main result comes in the form of a\nstrong constraint applicable to general UV models : if the dynamics of the\ncollapsing star exhibits a bounce, it always occurs below, or at most at the\nenergy threshold of horizon formation, so that only an instantaneous trapping\nhorizon may be formed while a trapped region never forms. This conclusion\nrelies solely on i) the assumption of continuity of the induced metric across\nthe time-like surface of the star and ii) the assumption of a classical\nSchwarzschild geometry describing the (vacuum) exterior of the star. In\nparticular, it is completely independent of the choice of corrections inside\nthe star which leads to singularity-resolution. The present model provides thus\na general framework to discuss bouncing compact objects, for which the interior\ngeometry is modeled either by a classical or a quantum bounce. In the later\ncase, our no-go result regarding the formation of trapped region suggests that\nadditional structure, such as the formation of an inner horizon, is needed to\nbuild consistent models of matter collapse describing black-to-white hole\nbounces. Indeed, such additional structure is needed to keep quantum gravity\neffects confined to the high curvature regime, in the deep interior region,\nproviding thus a new challenge for current constructions of quantum\nblack-to-white hole bounce models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jan 2020 03:45:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 16 Feb 2020 08:15:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 26 Feb 2020 02:14:22 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 27 Apr 2020 14:21:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-28"}

Consistency of the\nconstruction leads to several major deviations from the classical OS collapse\nmodel. Firstly, no trapped region can form and the bounce occurs always above,\nor at most at the Schwarzschild radius. Secondly, the bouncing star discussed\nhere admits an IR cut-off, additionally to the UV cut-off and corresponds\ntherefore to a pulsating compact object. Thirdly, the scale at which quantum\ngravity effects become non-negligible is encoded in the ratio between the UV\ncut-off of the quantum theory and the IR cut-off, which in turn, encodes the\nminimal energy density $\\rho_{\\text{min}}$ of the star prior to collapse.

It provides the ability to\ninclude a list of instructions (called segments), in the packet headers. The\nSegment Routing architecture has been first implemented with the MPLS dataplane\nand then, quite recently, with the IPv6 dataplane (SRv6). IPv6 Segment Routing\n(SRv6) is a promising solution to support advanced services such as Traffic\nEngineering, Service Function Chaining, Virtual Private Networks, and Load\nBalancing. The SRv6 data-plane is supported in many different software\nforwarding engines including the Linux kernel and VPP software router, as well\nas in hardware devices. In this paper, we present SRPerf, a performance\nevaluation framework for software and hardware implementations of SRv6. SRPerf\nis able to perform different benchmarking tests such as throughput and latency.\nFor throughput tests, we use the Partial Drop Rate (PDR) to characterize a\nsystem under test. The architecture of SRPerf can be easily extended to support\nnew benchmarking methodologies as well as different SRv6 implementations. We\nhave used SRPerf to evaluate the performance of the SRv6 implementation in the\nLinux kernel and in VPP. SRPerf is a valuable tool in the context of software\nforwarding engines where new features can be added at fast pace, as it helps\nexperimenters to validate their work.

An embedding strategy is\nproposed, and for a variant of it, we also make the corresponding analysis. For\naccurately evaluating the performance of our approach, a theoretical model of\nthe noise in an illegal channel is established by using a generalized Gaussian\ndistribution. By comparing with the experimental results based on various\nprinters, scanners, and a mobile phone, it can be found that the sample\nhistogram and curve fitting of the theoretical model match well, so it can be\nconcluded that the theoretical model works well. For evaluating the security of\nthe proposed LCAC code, besides the direct-copying (DC) attack, the improved\nversion, which is the synthesized-copying (SC) attack, is also considered in\nthis paper. Based on the theoretical model, we build a prediction function to\noptimize the parameters of our approach. The parameters optimization\nincorporates the covertness requirement, the robustness requirement and a\ntradeoff between the production cost and the cost of illegally-copying attacks\ntogether.

In this chapter,\nwe provide a natural and straight-forward extension of this concept to\ndynamical systems, focusing on continuous time models.

The analysis is based on line synthesis of the 7Li line at 6707\n{\\AA} in high-resolution spectra obtained during gravitational microlensing\nevents, when the brightnesses of the targets were highly magnified. Our main\nfinding is that the bulge stars at sub-solar metallicities, and that are older\nthan about eight billion years, does not show any sign of Li production, that\nis, the Li trend with metallicity is flat (or even slightly declining). This\nindicates that no lithium was produced during the first few billion years in\nthe history of the bulge. This finding is essentially identical to what is seen\nfor the (old) thick disk stars in the Solar neighbourhood, and adds another\npiece of evidence for a tight connection between the metal-poor bulge and the\nGalactic thick disk. For the bulge stars younger than about eight billion\nyears, the sample contains a group of stars at very high metallicities at\n[Fe/H]~+0.4 that have lithium abundances in the range A(Li)=2.6-2.8. In the\nSolar neighbourhood the lithium abundances have been found to peak at a\nA(Li)~3.3 at [Fe/H]~ +0.1 and then decrease by 0.4-0.5 dex when reaching\n[Fe/H]~+0.4. The few bulge stars that we have at these metallicities, seem to\nsupport this declining A(Li) trend. This could indeed support the recent claim\nthat the low A(Li) abundances at the highest metallicities seen in the Solar\nneighbourhood could be due to stars from the inner disk, or the bulge region,\nthat have migrated to the Solar neighbourhood.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jan 2020 10:06:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-26"}

Here we show that there exist conditions where its range of validity\ncan be greatly extended, providing strong numerical evidence that microgels\nadsorbed at an interface follow the two-dimensional Hertzian theory, and hence\nbehave like 2D elastic particles, up to very large deformations, in stark\ncontrast to what found in bulk conditions.

The performance of both nearest neighbor (NN) and support vector\nmachine (SVM) classification techniques is evaluated. Through numerical\nexamples, we show that under the same probability of false alarm, one-class\nclassification (OCC) algorithms achieve the lowest probability of missed\ndetection when a small spatial correlation exists between the main channel and\nthe adversary one, while statistical methods are advantageous when the spatial\ncorrelation between the two channels is large.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jan 2020 11:02:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Nov 2020 10:11:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-11"}

However, speckle noise presented in SAR images has a much\nnegative effect on change detection. In this research, a novel two-phase\nobject-based deep learning approach is proposed for multi-temporal SAR image\nchange detection. Compared with traditional methods, the proposed approach\nbrings two main innovations. One is to classify all pixels into three\ncategories rather than two categories: unchanged pixels, changed pixels caused\nby strong speckle (false changes), and changed pixels formed by real terrain\nvariation (real changes). The other is to group neighboring pixels into\nsegmented into superpixel objects (from pixels) such as to exploit local\nspatial context. Two phases are designed in the methodology: 1) Generate\nobjects based on the simple linear iterative clustering algorithm, and\ndiscriminate these objects into changed and unchanged classes using fuzzy\nc-means (FCM) clustering and a deep PCANet. The prediction of this Phase is the\nset of changed and unchanged superpixels. 2) Deep learning on the pixel sets\nover the changed superpixels only, obtained in the first phase, to discriminate\nreal changes from false changes. SLIC is employed again to achieve new\nsuperpixels in the second phase. Low rank and sparse decomposition are applied\nto these new superpixels to suppress speckle noise significantly. A further\nclustering step is applied to these new superpixels via FCM. A new PCANet is\nthen trained to classify two kinds of changed superpixels to achieve the final\nchange maps. Numerical experiments demonstrate that, compared with benchmark\nmethods, the proposed approach can distinguish real changes from false changes\neffectively with significantly reduced false alarm rates, and achieve up to\n99.71% change detection accuracy using multi-temporal SAR imagery.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jan 2020 11:51:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-20"}

DEA models seek a\nprojection point of the unit under evaluation on the efficient frontier of the\nproduction possibility set (PPS), which is used to set targets, while peers are\nidentified simply as the members of the so-called reference sets, which consist\nof the efficient units that determine the projection point as a combination of\nthem.

Nevertheless, there\nexist a class of gas-giant, highly irradiated objects---brown dwarfs orbiting\nwhite dwarfs in extremely tight orbits---whose orbital and hence rotation\nperiods are as short as 1-2 hours. Phase curves and other observations have\nalready been obtained for this class of objects, raising fundamental questions\nabout the role of increasing planetary rotation rate in controlling the\ncirculation. So far, most modeling studies have investigated rotation periods\nexceeding a day, as appropriate for typical hot Jupiters. Here we investigate\natmospheric circulation of tidally locked atmospheres with decreasing rotation\nperiods down to 2.5 hours. With decreasing rotation period, the width of the\nequatorial eastward jet decreases, consistent with the narrowing of the\nequatorial waveguide due to a decrease of the equatorial deformation radius.\nThe eastward-shifted equatorial hot spot offset decreases accordingly, and the\noff-equatorial westward-shifted hot areas become increasingly distinctive. At\nhigh latitudes, winds become weaker and more rotationally dominated. The\nday-night temperature contrast becomes larger due to the stronger influence of\nrotation. Our simulated atmospheres exhibit variability, presumably caused by\ninstabilities and wave interactions. Unlike typical hot Jupiter models, thermal\nphase curves of rapidly rotating models show a near alignment of peak flux to\nsecondary eclipse. This result helps to explain why, unlike hot Jupiters, many\nbrown dwarfs orbiting white dwarfs exhibit IR flux peaks aligned with secondary\neclipse.

This property is\ndesirable for long-lived applications (aiming to be highly available), yet has\nbeen precluded in previous asynchronous reliable broadcast protocols. We study\nthis property in a general adversarial (i.e., Byzantine) environment.\n  We introduce the first specification of a dynamic Byzantine reliable\nbroadcast (DBRB) primitive that is amenable to an asynchronous implementation.\nWe then present an algorithm implementing this specification in an asynchronous\nnetwork. Our DBRB algorithm ensures that if any correct process in the system\nbroadcasts a message, then every correct process delivers that message unless\nit leaves the system. Moreover, if a correct process delivers a message, then\nevery correct process that has not expressed its will to leave the system\ndelivers that message. We assume that more than $2/3$ of processes in the\nsystem are correct at all times, which is tight in our context.\n  We also show that if only one process in the system can fail---and it can\nfail only by crashing---then it is impossible to implement a stronger\nprimitive, ensuring that if any correct process in the system broadcasts or\ndelivers a message, then every correct process in the system delivers that\nmessage---including those that leave.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jan 2020 12:47:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Nov 2020 19:16:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-24"}

The study of AGN pairs (either dual or\nbinary) also represents an overarching theoretical problem in cosmology and\nastrophysics.

We prove that if $X$ is a zero-dimensional compact\nspace and $\\{r_s:s\\in \\Gamma\\}$ is an $r$-skeleton on $X$ such that $|r_s(X)|\n\\leq \\omega$ for all $s\\in \\Gamma$, then $X$ has a dense subset consisting of\nisolated points. Also we give conditions to an $r$-skeleton in order that this\n$r$-skeleton can be extended to an $r$-skeleton on the Alexandroff Duplicate of\nthe base space. The standard definition of a Valdivia compact spaces is via a\n$\\Sigma$-product of a power of the unit interval. Following this fact we\nintroduce the notion of $\\pi$-skeleton on a compact space $X$ by embedding $X$\nin a suitable power of the unit interval together with a pair\n$(\\mathcal{F},\\varphi)$, where $\\mathcal{F}$ is family of metric separable\nsubspaces of $X$ and $\\varphi$ an $\\omega$-monotone function which satisfy\ncertain properties.

This equivalence allows to give a new proof of the fact that\nthe product of compact spaces with retractional-skeletons admits an\nretractional-skeleton (see \\cite{cuth1}). In \\cite{casa1}, the Corson compact\nspaces are characterized by a special family of closed subsets.

Therefore, some deep learning methods are applied to\ndiscover rumors through the way they spread, such as Recursive Neural Network\n(RvNN) and so on. However, these deep learning methods only take into account\nthe patterns of deep propagation but ignore the structures of wide dispersion\nin rumor detection. Actually, propagation and dispersion are two crucial\ncharacteristics of rumors. In this paper, we propose a novel bi-directional\ngraph model, named Bi-Directional Graph Convolutional Networks (Bi-GCN), to\nexplore both characteristics by operating on both top-down and bottom-up\npropagation of rumors. It leverages a GCN with a top-down directed graph of\nrumor spreading to learn the patterns of rumor propagation, and a GCN with an\nopposite directed graph of rumor diffusion to capture the structures of rumor\ndispersion. Moreover, the information from the source post is involved in each\nlayer of GCN to enhance the influences from the roots of rumors.

The extensive thermodynamic quantity associated with\nspin transport is the magnetization; its Onsager-conjugate force is in general\nthe derivative of the free energy with respect to the magnetization. Spins are\ncarried in one of two ways: (1) by spin-polarized free electrons in magnetic\nmetals and doped semiconductors, or (2) by spin waves (magnons) that reside on\nlocalized electrons on unfilled d- or f-shells of transition metal or\nrare-earth elements. The paper covers both cases in separate chapters. In both\ncases, it is possible to define a spin chemical potential whose gradient is the\nmore practical conjugate force to spin transport. The paper further describes\nthe anomalous Hall, spin Hall, and inverse spin Hall effects in magnetic and\nnon-magnetic solids with strong spin-orbit coupling because these effects are\nused to generate and measure spin fluxes. Spin transport across interfaces is\ndescribed next, and includes spin pumping and spin transfer torque. The final\nchapter then puts all these concepts together to describe the spin-Seebeck,\nspin-Peltier, and magnon-drag effects, which exist in ferromagnetic,\nantiferromagnetic, and even paramagnetic solids. Magnon-drag, in particular, is\na high-temperature effect that boosts the thermopower of metals by an order of\nmagnitude and that of semiconductors by a factor of 2 or 3 above the electronic\ndiffusion thermopower. This is the only example where a spin-driven effect is\nlarger than a charge-driven effect. Magnon drag leads a simple binary\nparamagnetic semiconductor, MnTe, to have zT > 1 without optimization. This\nshows how adding spin as an additional design parameter in thermoelectrics\nresearch is a new and promising approach toward the quest for high-zT\nmaterials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jan 2020 15:19:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-09"}

We use a sliding window approach to extract\nsequences of networks of information sharing among single units in hippocampus\nand enthorinal cortex during anesthesia and study how global and node-wise\nfunctional connectivity properties evolve along time. First, we find that\ninformation sharing networks display, at any time, a core-periphery structure\nin which an integrated core of more tightly functionally interconnected units\nlink to more loosely connected network leaves. However the units participating\nto the core or to the periphery substantially change across time-windows.\nSecond, we find that discrete network states can be defined on top of this\ncontinuously ongoing liquid core-periphery reorganization. Switching between\nnetwork states results in a more abrupt modification of the units belonging to\nthe core and is only loosely linked to transitions between global oscillatory\nstates. Third, we characterize different styles of temporal connectivity that\ncells can exhibit within each state of the sharing network. While inhibitory\ncells tend to be central, we show that, otherwise, anatomical localization only\npoorly influences the patterns of temporal connectivity of the different cells.\nCells can also change temporal connectivity style when the network changes\nstate. Altogether, these findings reveal that the sharing of information\nmediated by the intrinsic dynamics of hippocampal and enthorinal cortex cell\nassemblies have a rich spatiotemporal structure, which could not have been\nidentified by more conventional time- or state-averaged analyses of functional\nconnectivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jan 2020 15:26:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-20"}

I show that this\nresult is paradoxical. The planets should evolve away from their observed\nstates by radial migration and gas accretion in about 1\\% of the system age.\nThese systems should then hatch tens of giant planets in their lifetime, and\nthere should exist a very large population of bright planet-less discs; none of\nthis is observationally supported. An alternative scenario, in which the\npopulation of bright ALMA discs is dominated by secondary discs recently\nrejuvenated by deposition of new gas, is proposed. The data are well explained\nif the gaseous mass of the discs is comparable to a Jovian planet mass, and\nthey last a small fraction of a Million years. Self-disruptions of dusty gas\ngiant protoplanets, previously predicted in the context of the Tidal Downsizing\ntheory of planet formation, provide a suitable mechanism for such injections of\nnew fuel, and yield disc and planet properties commensurate with ALMA\nobservations. If this scenario is correct, then the secondary discs have\ngas-to-dust ratios considerably smaller than 100, and long look ALMA and\nNIR/optical observations of dimmer targets should uncover dusty, not yet\ndisrupted, gas clumps with sizes of order an AU. Alternatively, secondary discs\ncould originate from late external deposition of gas into the system, in which\ncase we expect widespread signatures of warped outer discs that have not yet\ncome into alignment with the planets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jan 2020 15:34:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-12"}

The core of latency prediction is to\nencode each network architecture and feed it into a multi-layer regressor, with\nthe training data which can be easily collected from randomly sampling a number\nof architectures and evaluating them on the hardware.

Yet, unlike\ntraditional algorithms in this field, little is known about DNNs from the\nprinciples of numerical analysis, e.g., stability, accuracy, computational\nefficiency and sample complexity. In this paper we introduce a computational\nframework for examining DNNs in practice, and use it to study empirical\nperformance with regard to these issues. We study performance of DNNs of\ndifferent widths & depths on test functions in various dimensions, including\nsmooth and piecewise smooth functions. We also compare DL against best-in-class\nmethods for smooth function approx. based on compressed sensing (CS). Our main\nconclusion from these experiments is that there is a crucial gap between the\napproximation theory of DNNs and their practical performance, with trained DNNs\nperforming relatively poorly on functions for which there are strong\napproximation results (e.g. smooth functions), yet performing well in\ncomparison to best-in-class methods for other functions. To analyze this gap\nfurther, we provide some theoretical insights. We establish a practical\nexistence theorem, asserting existence of a DNN architecture and training\nprocedure that offers the same performance as CS. This establishes a key\ntheoretical benchmark, showing the gap can be closed, albeit via a strategy\nguaranteed to perform as well as, but no better than, current best-in-class\nschemes. Nevertheless, it demonstrates the promise of practical DNN approx., by\nhighlighting potential for better schemes through careful design of DNN\narchitectures and training strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jan 2020 20:08:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 00:23:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2021 23:42:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-17"}

Our predictions have an average root mean square\n(RMS) distance of 1.08 mm between the predicted and true shapes, making it more\naccurate than the average error achieved by eight other examined 3D bone\nreconstruction approaches. The prediction process that we use is fully\nautomated and unlike many competing approaches, it does not rely on any\nprevious knowledge about bone geometry. Additionally, our neural network can\ndetermine the identity of a bone based only on its X-ray image. It computes a\nlow-dimensional representation (\"embedding\") of each 2D X-ray image and\nhenceforth compares different X-ray images based only on their embeddings. An\nembedding holds enough information to uniquely identify the bone CT belonging\nto the input X-ray image with a 100% accuracy and can therefore serve as a kind\nof fingerprint for that bone.

An improved FDO (IFDO) algorithm is presented in this work, and this\nalgorithm contributes considerably to refining the ability of the original FDO\nto address complicated optimization problems. To improve the FDO, the IFDO\ncalculates the alignment and cohesion and then uses these behaviors with the\npace at which the FDO updates its position. Moreover, in determining the\nweights, the FDO uses the weight factor (wf), which is zero in most cases and\none in only a few cases. Conversely, the IFDO performs wf randomization in the\n[0-1] range and then minimizes the range when a better fitness weight value is\nachieved. In this work, the IFDO algorithm and its method of converging on the\noptimal solution are demonstrated. Additionally, 19 classical standard test\nfunction groups are utilized to test the IFDO, and then the FDO and three other\nwell-known algorithms, namely, the particle swarm algorithm (PSO), dragonfly\nalgorithm (DA), and genetic algorithm (GA), are selected to evaluate the IFDO\nresults. Furthermore, the CECC06 2019 Competition, which is the set of IEEE\nCongress of Evolutionary Computation benchmark test functions, is utilized to\ntest the IFDO, and then, the FDO and three recent algorithms, namely, the salp\nswarm algorithm (SSA), DA and whale optimization algorithm (WOA), are chosen to\ngauge the IFDO results. The results show that IFDO is practical in some cases,\nand its results are improved in most cases. Finally, to prove the\npracticability of the IFDO, it is used in real-world applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 16 Jan 2020 21:50:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-03"}
