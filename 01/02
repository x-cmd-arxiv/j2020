These materials feature paramagnetic defects in a low nuclear spin\nenvironment to reduce the impact of nuclear spin on electronic spin coherence.\nIn this work, we report single crystal growth of Ba$_2$CaWO$_{6-\\delta}$, and\nthe coherence properties of controllably introduced W$^{5+}$ spin centers\ngenerated by oxygen vacancies.

However, due to the\ndiversity of network components and complex serial-parallel hybrid connections\nin modern DNNs, the evaluation of existing metrics usually requires strong\nassumptions, complex statistical analysis, or has limited application fields,\nwhich constraints their spread in the community. In this paper, inspired by the\nGradient Norm Equality and dynamical isometry, we first propose a novel metric\ncalled Block Dynamical Isometry, which measures the change of gradient norm in\nindividual block. Because our Block Dynamical Isometry is norm-based, its\nevaluation needs weaker assumptions compared with the original dynamical\nisometry. To mitigate the challenging derivation, we propose a highly\nmodularized statistical framework based on free probability.

The standard approach relies on the \\emph{kernel trick} to perform\npairwise evaluations of a kernel function, leading to scalability issues for\nlarge datasets due to its linear and superlinear growth with respect to the\ntraining data. Recently, we proposed \\emph{no-trick} (NT) kernel adaptive\nfiltering (KAF) that leverages explicit feature space mappings using\ndata-independent basis with constant complexity. The inner product defined by\nthe feature mapping corresponds to a positive-definite finite-rank kernel that\ninduces a finite-dimensional reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS).\nInformation theoretic learning (ITL) is a framework where information theory\ndescriptors based on non-parametric estimator of Renyi entropy replace\nconventional second-order statistics for the design of adaptive systems. An\nRKHS for ITL defined on a space of probability density functions simplifies\nstatistical inference for supervised or unsupervised learning. ITL criteria\ntake into account the higher-order statistical behavior of the systems and\nsignals as desired. However, this comes at a cost of increased computational\ncomplexity. In this paper, we extend the NT kernel concept to ITL for improved\ninformation extraction from the signal without compromising scalability.\nSpecifically, we focus on a family of fast, scalable, and accurate estimators\nfor ITL using explicit inner product space (EIPS) kernels. We demonstrate the\nsuperior performance of EIPS-ITL estimators and combined NT-KAF using EIPS-ITL\ncost functions through experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jan 2020 20:21:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-03"}

However, most existing quantization\nmethods require access to the original training dataset for retraining during\nquantization. This is often not possible for applications with sensitive or\nproprietary data, e.g., due to privacy and security concerns. Existing\nzero-shot quantization methods use different heuristics to address this, but\nthey result in poor performance, especially when quantizing to ultra-low\nprecision. Here, we propose ZeroQ , a novel zero-shot quantization framework to\naddress this. ZeroQ enables mixed-precision quantization without any access to\nthe training or validation data. This is achieved by optimizing for a Distilled\nDataset, which is engineered to match the statistics of batch normalization\nacross different layers of the network. ZeroQ supports both uniform and\nmixed-precision quantization. For the latter, we introduce a novel Pareto\nfrontier based method to automatically determine the mixed-precision bit\nsetting for all layers, with no manual search involved.

To address this issue, we develop an effective spatiotemporal\nfeature alignment network tailored to VSP, mainly including two key\nsub-networks: a multi-scale deformable convolutional alignment network (MDAN)\nand a bidirectional convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-ConvLSTM) network.\nThe MDAN learns to align the features of the neighboring frames to the\nreference one in a coarse-to-fine manner, which can well handle various\nmotions. Specifically, the MDAN owns a pyramidal feature hierarchy structure\nthat first leverages deformable convolution (Dconv) to align the\nlower-resolution features across frames, and then aggregates the aligned\nfeatures to align the higher-resolution features, progressively enhancing the\nfeatures from top to bottom.

Statistical hypothesis testing of\ncovariate-by-treatment interaction is ill-suited for this purpose. The\napplication of decision theory results in treatment rules that compare the\nexpected benefit of treatment given the patient's covariates against a\ntreatment threshold. However, determining treatment threshold is often\ncontext-specific, and any given threshold might seem arbitrary when the overall\ncapacity towards predicting treatment benefit is of concern. We propose the\nConcentration of Benefit index (Cb), a threshold-free metric that quantifies\nthe combined performance of covariates towards finding individuals who will\nbenefit the most from treatment. The construct of the proposed index is\ncomparing expected treatment outcomes with and without knowledge of covariates\nwhen one of a two randomly selected patients are to be treated.

If FDM is the correct theory of dark matter, then\nthe predicted soliton core can help to form the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) in\nthe Milky Way. We present high-resolution hydrodynamical simulations of gas\nflow patterns to constrain the properties of the soliton core based on a\nrealistic Milky Way potential. We find that a dense center is required to form\na reasonable CMZ. The size and kinematics of the CMZ offer a relatively strong\nconstraint on the inner enclosed mass profile of the Galaxy. If a soliton core\nis not considered, a compact nuclear bulge alone with a radially varying\nmass-to-light ratio can match the observed size and kinematics of the CMZ. A\nsoliton core model with a mass of $\\approx4.0\\times10^8{\\; {\\rm M}_{\\odot}}$\nand a core radius of $\\approx0.05{\\;{\\rm kpc}}$, together with a less massive\nnuclear bulge with a constant mass-to-light ratio, also agrees nicely with the\ncurrent data. Such a FDM soliton core corresponds to a boson mass of\n$\\sim2-7\\times10^{-22}{\\;{\\rm eV}}$, which could be further constrained by the\nimproved determination of the mass-to-light ratio in the Galactic center.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jan 2020 04:04:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-12"}

The training log and the performance for each architecture candidate are\nprovided for three datasets.

Firstly, the image grid data is\nextended to graph structure data by a convolutional network, which transforms\nthe semantic segmentation problem into a graph node classification problem.\nThen we apply graph convolutional network to solve this graph node\nclassification problem. As far as we know, it is the first time that we apply\nthe graph convolutional network in image semantic segmentation.

However, CBCT images are of low-quality and\nartifact-laden due to noise, poor tissue contrast, and the presence of metallic\nobjects, causing vertebra segmentation, even manually, a demanding task. In\ncontrast, there exists a wealth of artifact-free, high quality CT images with\nvertebra annotations. This motivates us to build a CBCT vertebra segmentation\nmodel using unpaired CT images with annotations. To overcome the domain and\nartifact gaps between CBCT and CT, it is a must to address the three\nheterogeneous tasks of vertebra segmentation, artifact reduction and modality\ntranslation all together.

Existing approaches for\nspatiotemporal video denoising tend to suffer from motion blur artifacts, that\nis, the boundary of a moving object tends to appear blurry especially when the\nobject undergoes a fast motion, causing optical flow calculation to break down.\nIn this paper, we address this challenge by designing a first-image-then-video\ntwo-stage denoising neural network, consisting of an image denoising module for\nspatially reducing intra-frame noise followed by a regular spatiotemporal video\ndenoising module. The intuition is simple yet powerful and effective: the first\nstage of image denoising effectively reduces the noise level and, therefore,\nallows the second stage of spatiotemporal denoising for better modeling and\nlearning everywhere, including along the moving object boundaries.

Despite the recent advances in deep learning based\nclose-talk speech separation, the applications to real-world are still an open\nissue. Two main challenges are the complex acoustic environment and the\nreal-time processing requirement. To address these challenges, we propose a\ntemporal-spatial neural filter, which directly estimates the target speech\nwaveform from multi-speaker mixture in reverberant environments, assisted with\ndirectional information of the speaker(s). Firstly, against variations brought\nby complex environment, the key idea is to increase the acoustic representation\ncompleteness through the jointly modeling of temporal, spectral and spatial\ndiscriminability between the target and interference source. Specifically,\ntemporal, spectral, spatial along with the designed directional features are\nintegrated to create a joint acoustic representation. Secondly, to reduce the\nlatency, we design a fully-convolutional autoencoder framework, which is purely\nend-to-end and single-pass. All the feature computation is implemented by the\nnetwork layers and operations to speed up the separation procedure. Evaluation\nis conducted on simulated reverberant dataset WSJ0-2mix and WSJ0-3mix under\nspeaker-independent scenario. Experimental results demonstrate that the\nproposed method outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning based multi-channel\napproaches with fewer parameters and faster processing speed. Furthermore, the\nproposed temporal-spatial neural filter can handle mixtures with varying and\nunknown number of speakers and exhibits persistent performance even when\nexisting a direction estimation error. Codes and models will be released soon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jan 2020 11:12:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-03"}

The standard WiFi association method makes the STAs select the AP\nwith the strongest signal, which in many cases leads to underutilization of\nsome APs while overcrowding others. To mitigate this situation, Reinforcement\nLearning techniques such as Multi-Armed Bandits can be used to dynamically\nlearn the optimal mapping between APs and STAs, and so redistribute the STAs\namong the available APs accordingly. This is an especially challenging problem\nsince the network response observed by a given STA depends on the behavior of\nthe others, and so it is very difficult to predict without a global view of the\nnetwork.\n  In this paper, we focus on solving this problem in a decentralized way, where\nSTAs independently explore the different APs inside their coverage range, and\nselect the one that better satisfy their needs. To do it, we propose a novel\napproach called Opportunistic epsilon-greedy with Stickiness that halts the\nexploration when a suitable AP is found, only resuming the exploration after\nseveral unsatisfactory association rounds. With this approach, we reduce\nsignificantly the network response dynamics, improving the ability of the STAs\nto find a solution faster, as well as achieving a more efficient use of the\nnetwork resources.\n  We investigate how the characteristics of the scenario (position of the APs\nand STAs, traffic loads, and channel allocation strategies) impact the learning\nprocess and the achievable performance. We also show that not all the STAs have\nto implement the proposed solution to improve their performance.

The SRN techniques capture the flow in a thinner neighborhood of\nthe manifold, affording a leading order representation of the slow flow via as\nprojection of the flow onto the tangent plane of the manifold. The SRN approach\nrequires a spectral gap in the linearization of the full gradient flow about\nthe points on the low-energy manifold.

Most of the existing methods are\nbuilt on the framework of generalized linear and additive models, which are\noften challenging to optimize and to interpret. Therefore, we suggest circular\nregression trees and random forests as an intuitive alternative approach that\nis relatively easy to fit. Building on previous ideas for trees modeling\ncircular means, we suggest a distributional approach for both trees and forests\nyielding probabilistic forecasts based on the von Mises distribution. The\nresulting tree-based models simplify the estimation process by using the\navailable covariates for partitioning the data into sufficiently homogeneous\nsubgroups so that a simple von Mises distribution without further covariates\ncan be fitted to the circular response in each subgroup. These circular\nregression trees are straightforward to interpret, can capture nonlinear\neffects and interactions, and automatically select the relevant covariates that\nare associated with either location and/or scale changes in the von Mises\ndistribution. Combining an ensemble of circular regression trees to a circular\nregression forest yields a local adaptive likelihood estimator for the von\nMises distribution that can regularize and smooth the covariate effects.

Part III of this monograph starts by addressing ways to\nlearn graph topology, from the case where the physics of the problem already\nsuggest a possible topology, through to most general cases where the graph\ntopology is learned from the data. A particular emphasis is on graph topology\ndefinition based on the correlation and precision matrices of the observed\ndata, combined with additional prior knowledge and structural conditions, such\nas the smoothness or sparsity of graph connections. For learning sparse graphs\n(with small number of edges), the least absolute shrinkage and selection\noperator, known as LASSO is employed, along with its graph specific variant,\ngraphical LASSO. For completeness, both variants of LASSO are derived in an\nintuitive way, and explained. An in-depth elaboration of the graph topology\nlearning paradigm is provided through several examples on physically well\ndefined graphs, such as electric circuits, linear heat transfer, social and\ncomputer networks, and spring-mass systems. As many graph neural networks (GNN)\nand convolutional graph networks (GCN) are emerging, we have also reviewed the\nmain trends in GNNs and GCNs, from the perspective of graph signal filtering.\nTensor representation of lattice-structured graphs is next considered, and it\nis shown that tensors (multidimensional data arrays) are a special class of\ngraph signals, whereby the graph vertices reside on a high-dimensional regular\nlattice structure. This part of monograph concludes with two emerging\napplications in financial data processing and underground transportation\nnetworks modeling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jan 2020 13:14:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-03"}

Using IFU data from the ongoing\nSDSS-IV MaNGA survey, we have performed a thorough search for WR galaxies. We\nfirst identify H II regions in each datacube and carry out full spectral\nfitting to the stacked spectra. We then visually inspect the residual spectrum\nof each H II region and identify WR regions that present a significant \"blue\nbump\" at 4600-4750 A. The resulting WR catalog includes 267 WR regions of\n~500pc (radius) sizes, distributed in 90 galaxies from the current sample of\nMaNGA (MaNGA Product Launch 7). We find WR regions are exclusively found in\ngalaxies that show bluest colors and highest star formation rates for their\nmass. Most WR galaxies have late-type morphologies and show relatively large\nasymmetry in their images, implying that WR regions are more preferentially\nfound in interacting/merging galaxies. We estimate the stellar mass function of\nWR galaxies and the mass-dependent detection rate. The detection rate of WR\ngalaxies is typically ~2%, with weak dependence on stellar mass. This detection\nrate is about 40 times higher than previous studies with SDSS single fiber\ndata, and by a factor of 2 lower than the CALIFA-based WR catalog.

Then, Section 1.3\npresents the Gordon growth model (Gordon 1962) with some of its extensions\n(Malkiel 1963, Fuller and Hsia 1984, Molodovsky et al. 1965, Brooks and Helms\n1990, Barsky and De Long 1993), and reports some empirical evidence. Extended\nreviews of the Gordon stock valuation model and its extensions can be found in\nKamstra (2003) and Damodaran (2012). In Section 1.4, the focus is directed to\nmore recent advancements which make us of the Markov chain to model the\ndividend process (Hurley and Johnson 1994, Yao 1997, Hurley and Johnson 1998,\nGhezzi and Piccardi 2003, Barbu et al. 2017, D'Amico and De Blasis 2018). The\nadvantage of these models is the possibility to obtain a different valuation\nthat depends on the state of the dividend series, allowing the model to be\ncloser to reality. In addition, these models permit to obtain a measure of the\nrisk of the single stock or a portfolio of stocks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jan 2020 14:49:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-03"}

The permanence of\nillicit content inserted in Bitcoin poses a challenge to law enforcement\nagencies like Interpol, and millions of dollars are lost in buggy smart\ncontracts in Ethereum. A line of research then spawned on Redactable\nblockchains with the aim of solving the problem of redacting illicit contents\nfrom both permissioned and permissionless blockchains. However, all the\nexisting proposals follow the build-new-chain approach for redactions, and\ncannot be integrated with existing systems like Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n  We present Reparo, a generic protocol that acts as a publicly verifiable\nlayer on top of any blockchain to perform repairs, ranging from fixing buggy\ncontracts to removing illicit contents from the chain. Reparo facilitates\nadditional functionalities for blockchains while maintaining the same provable\nsecurity guarantee; thus, Reparo can be integrated with existing blockchains\nand start performing repairs on the pre-existent data. Any system user may\npropose a repair and a deliberation process ensues resulting in a decision that\ncomplies with the repair policy of the chain and is publicly verifiable.\n  Our Reparo layer can be easily tailored to different consensus requirements,\ndoes not require heavy cryptographic machinery and can, therefore, be\nefficiently instantiated in any permission-ed or -less setting. We demonstrate\nit by giving efficient instantiations of Reparo on top of Ethereum (with PoS\nand PoW), Bitcoin, and Cardano. Moreover, we evaluate Reparo with Ethereum\nmainnet and show that the cost of fixing several prominent smart contract bugs\nis almost negligible. For instance, the cost of repairing the prominent Parity\nMultisig wallet bug with Reparo is as low as 0.000000018% of the Ethers that\ncan be retrieved after the fix.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jan 2020 15:20:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 2021 22:51:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-12"}

To investigate the completeness of recorded\nprostate cancer mortality, we compared other-cause (non-prostate cancer)\nmortality in men found and not found to have prostate cancer following a needle\nbiopsy.\n  Methods: We linked Medicare claims data to SEER data to analyze survival in\nthe population of men aged 65+ enrolled in Medicare who resided in a SEER area\nand received a needle biopsy in 1993-2001. We compared other-cause mortality in\nmen found to have prostate cancer (n=53,462) to that in men not found to have\nprostate cancer (n=103,659).\n  Results: The age-race adjusted other-cause mortality rate was 471 per 10,000\nperson-years in men found to have prostate cancer vs. 468 per 10,000 in men not\nfound to have prostate cancer (RR = 1.01;95% CI:0.98-1.03).

The finite-temperature\nHartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (FT-HFB) theory is a primary choice for this purpose,\nhowever, its numerical calculation for superfluid (superconducting)\nmany-fermion systems in three dimensions requires enormous computational costs.\nTo study a variety of phases in the crust of hot and cold neutron stars, we\npropose an efficient method to perform the FT-HFB calculation with the\nthree-dimensional (3D) coordinate-space representation. Recently, an efficient\nmethod based on the contour integral of Green's function with the shifted\nconjugate-orthogonal conjugate-gradient method has been proposed [Phys. Rev. C\n95, 044302 (2017)]. We extend the method to the finite temperature, using the\nshifted conjugate-orthogonal conjugate-residual method. We benchmark the 3D\ncoordinate-space solver of the FT-HFB calculation for hot isolated nuclei and\nfcc phase in the inner crust of neutron stars at finite temperature. The\ncomputational performance of the present method is demonstrated. Different\ncritical temperatures of the quadrupole and the octupole deformations are\nconfirmed for $^{146}$Ba. The robustness of the shape coexistence feature in\n$^{184}$Hg is examined. For the neutron-star crust, the deformed neutron-rich\nSe nuclei embedded in the sea of superfluid low-density neutrons appear in the\nfcc phase at the nucleon density of 0.045 fm$^{-3}$ and the temperature of $k_B\nT=200$ keV.

Optical BICs have found many applications, mainly because\nthey give rise to resonances with ultra-high quality factors. If the periodic\nstructure has a relevant symmetry, a BIC may have a symmetry mismatch with\nincoming and outgoing propagating waves of the same frequency and compatible\nwavevectors, and is considered as protected by symmetry. Propagating BICs with\nnonzero Bloch wavevectors have been found on many highly symmetric periodic\nstructures. They are not protected by symmetry in the usual sense (i.e., there\nis no symmetry mismatch), but some of them seem to depend on symmetry for their\nexistence and robustness. In this paper, we show that the low-frequency\npropagating BICs (with only one radiation channel) on biperiodic structures\nwith an inversion symmetry in the plane of periodicity and a reflection\nsymmetry in the perpendicular direction are robust to symmetry-preserving\nstructural perturbations. In other words, a propagating BIC continues its\nexistence with a slightly different frequency and a slightly different Bloch\nwavevector, when the biperiodic structure is perturbed slightly preserving the\ninversion and reflection symmetries.

We propose a model called Speaker-Aware\nSpeech-Transformer (SAST), which is a standard ST equipped with a speaker\nattention module (SAM). The SAM has a static speaker knowledge block (SKB) that\nis made of i-vectors. At each time step, the encoder output attends to the\ni-vectors in the block, and generates a weighted combined speaker embedding\nvector, which helps the model to normalize the speaker variations. The SAST\nmodel trained in this way becomes independent of specific training speakers and\nthus generalizes better to unseen testing speakers. We investigate different\nfactors of SAM. Experimental results on the AISHELL-1 task show that SAST\nachieves a relative 6.5% CER reduction (CERR) over the speaker-independent (SI)\nbaseline.

It is rather difficult when translating from the low-resource\nand morphologically-rich agglutinative languages, which have complex morphology\nand large vocabulary. In this paper, we propose a morphological word\nsegmentation method on the source-side for NMT that incorporates morphology\nknowledge to preserve the linguistic and semantic information in the word\nstructure while reducing the vocabulary size at training time. It can be\nutilized as a preprocessing tool to segment the words in agglutinative\nlanguages for other natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

Using data from a\ncohort of 774 participants, we demonstrate that our deep-learning models are\nable to distinguish between people with and without MS with an area under the\nreceiver operating characteristic curve of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.70, 0.88). Our\nexperimental results indicate that digital biomarkers derived from smartphone\ndata could in the future be used as additional diagnostic criteria for MS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jan 2020 15:29:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 18 Jul 2020 12:12:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 07:32:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-03"}

This paper presents a study of selecting the best\nSoftware Reliability Growth Model according to the dataset at hand. Several\nComparison Criteria are used to yield a ranking methodology to be used in\npointing out best models. The Social Spider Algorithm SSA, one of the newly\nintroduced Swarm Intelligent Algorithms, is used for estimating the parameters\nof the SRGMs for two datasets. Results indicate that the use of SSA was\nefficient in assisting the process of criteria weighting to find the optimal\nmodel and the best overall ranking of employed models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 1 Jan 2020 17:19:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-28"}
