Accordingly, we study the lowest-energy states of an open string\n$q\\bar q$ system in QCD and QED in 1+1 dimensions. We show that $\\pi^0, \\eta$,\nand $\\eta'$ can be adequately described as open string $q\\bar q$ QCD mesons. By\nextrapolating into the $q\\bar q$ QED sector in which a quark and an antiquark\ninteract with the QED interaction, we find an open string isoscalar\n$I(J^\\pi)$=$0(0^-)$ QED meson state at 17.9$\\pm$1.5 MeV and an isovector\n$(I(J^\\pi)$=$1(0^-), I_3$=0) QED meson state at 36.4$\\pm$3.8 MeV. The predicted\nmasses of the isoscalar and isovector QED mesons are close to the masses of the\nhypothetical X17 and E38 particles observed recently, making them good\ncandidates for these particles. The decay products of QED mesons may show up as\nexcess $e^+e^-$ and $\\gamma \\gamma$ pairs in the anomalous soft photon\nphenomenon associated with hadron productions in high-energy hadron-proton\ncollisions and $e^+$-$e^-$ annihilations. Measurements of the invariant masses\nof excess $e^+e^-$ and $\\gamma \\gamma$ pairs will provide tests for the\nexistence of the open string $q\\bar q$ QED mesons. An assembly of gravitating\nQED mesons are expected to emit electron-positron pairs and/or gamma rays and\ntheir decay energies and lifetimes will be modified by their gravitational\nbinding energies.

Moreover, momentum and mass conservation\nequations are adopted and there solution allows for the calculation of the\nadvective contribution to the transport in the NP equations.\n  The proposed framework is developed by first deriving the numerical model\nequations (NMEs) corresponding to the partial differential equations (PDEs)\nbased on several different time and space discretization schemes, which are\ncompared to assess solutions accuracy. The derivation also considers various\ncharge conservation scenarios, which also have pros and cons in terms of speed\nand accuracy. Ion transport problems in arbitrary pore networks were considered\nand solved using both PNM and finite element method (FEM) solvers. Comparisons\nshowed an average deviation, in terms of ions concentration, between PNM and\nFEM below $5\\%$ with the PNM simulations being over ${10}^{4}$ times faster\nthan the FEM ones for a medium including about ${10}^{4}$ pores. The improved\naccuracy is achieved by utilizing more accurate discretization schemes for both\nthe advective and migrative terms, adopted from the CFD literature. The NMEs\nwere implemented within the open-source package OpenPNM based on the iterative\nGummel algorithm with relaxation.\n  This work presents a comprehensive approach to modeling charged species\ntransport suitable for a wide range of applications from electrochemical\ndevices to nanoparticle movement in the subsurface.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jan 2020 16:33:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-20"}

However, conventional methods either ignore the topological\ninformation of metro systems or directly learn on physical topology, and cannot\nfully explore the patterns of ridership evolution. To address this problem, we\nmodel a metro system as graphs with various topologies and propose a unified\nPhysical-Virtual Collaboration Graph Network (PVCGN), which can effectively\nlearn the complex ridership patterns from the tailor-designed graphs.\nSpecifically, a physical graph is directly built based on the realistic\ntopology of the studied metro system, while a similarity graph and a\ncorrelation graph are built with virtual topologies under the guidance of the\ninter-station passenger flow similarity and correlation. These complementary\ngraphs are incorporated into a Graph Convolution Gated Recurrent Unit (GC-GRU)\nfor spatial-temporal representation learning. Further, a Fully-Connected Gated\nRecurrent Unit (FC-GRU) is also applied to capture the global evolution\ntendency.

These messages tend to be\nvery short, making them difficult to identify in isolation. Furthermore,\nspammers disguise their messages to look legitimate, tricking users into\nclicking on links and tricking spam filters into tolerating their malicious\nbehavior. Thus, some spam filters examine relational structure in the domain,\nsuch as connections among users and messages, to better identify deceptive\ncontent. However, even when it is used, relational structure is often exploited\nin an incomplete or ad hoc manner. In this paper, we present Extended\nGroup-based Graphical models for Spam (EGGS), a general-purpose method for\nclassifying spam in online social networks. Rather than labeling each message\nindependently, we group related messages together when they have the same\nauthor, the same content, or other domain-specific connections. To reason about\nrelated messages, we combine two popular methods: stacked graphical learning\n(SGL) and probabilistic graphical models (PGM). Both methods capture the idea\nthat messages are more likely to be spammy when related messages are also\nspammy, but they do so in different ways; SGL uses sequential classifier\npredictions and PGMs use probabilistic inference. We apply our method to four\ndifferent social network domains. EGGS is more accurate than an independent\nmodel in most experimental settings, especially when the correct label is\nuncertain. For the PGM implementation, we compare Markov logic networks to\nprobabilistic soft logic and find that both work well with neither one\ndominating, and the combination of SGL and PGMs usually performs better than\neither on its own.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jan 2020 17:06:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Jan 2020 22:10:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-30"}

We compute various phase diagrams as the\nsystem undergoes BCS-BEC crossover, using the same pairing fluctuation theory\nas in Part I. We find widespread pseudogap phenomena beyond the BCS regime and\nintermediate temperature superfluid states for relatively low population\nimbalances. The Fermi surface topology plays an important role in the behavior\nof $T_\\text{c}$. For large $d$ and/or small $t$, which yield an open Fermi\nsurface, superfluidity can be readily destroyed by a small amount of population\nimbalance $p$. The superfluid phase, especially in the BEC regime, can exist\nonly for a highly restricted volume of the parameter space.

This parameterization also leads to trajectories which are more\nconservative, producing less overshoot in underdamped systems with modeling\nerror.

Data skew arises from a number of causes\nsuch as removal of existing storage nodes and addition of new empty nodes to\nthe database. Data skew leads to performance degradations and\n\\textcolor{black}{thus} necessitates `rebalancing' at regular intervals to\nreduce the amount of skew. We define an $r$-balanced distributed database as a\ndistributed database in which the storage across the nodes has uniform size,\nand each bit of the data is replicated in $r$ distinct storage nodes. We\nconsider the problem of designing such balanced databases along with associated\nrebalancing schemes which maintain the $r$-balanced property under node removal\nand addition operations.

Thus, constructing a fair machine learning model while\nsimultaneously providing privacy protection becomes a challenging problem. In\nthis paper, we focus on the design of classification model with fairness and\ndifferential privacy guarantees by jointly combining functional mechanism and\ndecision boundary fairness. In order to enforce $\\epsilon$-differential privacy\nand fairness, we leverage the functional mechanism to add different amounts of\nLaplace noise regarding different attributes to the polynomial coefficients of\nthe objective function in consideration of fairness constraint.

This is partially driven by variations in the dust-uncorrected\nUV-slope of galaxies, due to different star-formation histories of galaxies\nselected at different cosmic epochs; we suggest the remainder of the effect is\ncaused by differences in the effective dust attenuation curves (EDACs) of\ngalaxies as a function of redshift. We find a typical galaxy-to-galaxy\nvariation of 0.3 dex in IRX at fixed $\\beta$, correlated with intrinsic galaxy\nproperties: galaxies with higher star-formation rates, star-formation\nefficiencies, gas metallicities and stellar masses exhibit larger IRX values.\nWe demonstrate a degeneracy between stellar age, dust geometry and dust\ncomposition: $z=4$ galaxies with a Small Magellanic Cloud dust type follow the\nsame IRX-$\\beta$ relation as low-redshift galaxies with MW dust. We provide a\nredshift-dependent fitting function for the IRX-$\\beta$ relation for MW dust\nbased on our models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jan 2020 19:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 2020 07:20:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-28"}

We\nrefer to the new model as DELG, standing for DEep Local and Global features.

Active learning (AL) has been widely used for this purpose. However, most\nexisting AL approaches are supervised: they train an initial model from a small\namount of labeled samples, query new samples based on the model, and then\nupdate the model iteratively. Few of them have considered the completely\nunsupervised AL problem, i.e., starting from zero, how to optimally select the\nvery first few samples to label, without knowing any label information at all.\nThis problem is very challenging, as no label information can be utilized. This\npaper studies unsupervised pool-based AL for linear regression problems. We\npropose a novel AL approach that considers simultaneously the informativeness,\nrepresentativeness, and diversity, three essential criteria in AL.

Modes which are calculated\nto be linearly driven should increase their amplitudes exponentially with time;\nthe fact that nearly constant amplitudes are usually observed is evidence that\nnonlinear mechanisms inhibit the growth of finite amplitude pulsations. Models\npredict that the mass of convection zones in pulsating hydrogen-atmosphere\n(DAV) white dwarfs is very sensitive to temperature (i.e., $M_{\\rm CZ} \\propto\nT_{\\rm eff}^{-90}$), leading to the possibility that even low-amplitude\npulsators may experience significant nonlinear effects. In particular, the\nouter turning point of finite-amplitude g-mode pulsations can vary with the\nlocal surface temperature, producing a reflected wave that is out of phase with\nwhat is required for a standing wave. This can lead to a lack of coherence of\nthe mode and a reduction in its global amplitude. In this paper we show that:\n(1) whether a mode is calculated to propagate to the base of the convection\nzone is an accurate predictor of its width in the Fourier spectrum, (2) the\nphase shifts produced by reflection from the outer turning point are large\nenough to produce significant damping, and (3) amplitudes and periods are\npredicted to increase from the blue edge to the middle of the instability\nstrip, and subsequently decrease as the red edge is approached.

Yet, evidence for efficient\ncommunication in structural brain networks characterized by hierarchical\norganization and highly connected hubs remains sparse. The principle of\nefficient coding proposes that the brain transmits maximal information in a\nmetabolically economical or compressed form to improve future behavior. To\ndetermine how structural connectivity supports efficient coding, we develop a\ntheory specifying minimum rates of message transmission between brain regions\nto achieve an expected fidelity, and we test five predictions from the theory\nbased on random walk communication dynamics. In doing so, we introduce the\nmetric of compression efficiency, which quantifies the trade-off between lossy\ncompression and transmission fidelity in structural networks. In a large sample\nof youth (n = 1,042; age 8-23 years), we analyze structural networks derived\nfrom diffusion weighted imaging and metabolic expenditure operationalized using\ncerebral blood flow. We show that structural networks strike compression\nefficiency trade-offs consistent with theoretical predictions. We find that\ncompression efficiency prioritizes fidelity with development, heightens when\nmetabolic resources and myelination guide communication, explains advantages of\nhierarchical organization, links higher input fidelity to disproportionate\nareal expansion, and shows that hubs integrate information by lossy\ncompression. Lastly, compression efficiency is predictive of behavior--beyond a\nconventional metric--for cognitive domains including executive function,\nmemory, complex reasoning, and social cognition. Our findings elucidate how\nmacroscale connectivity supports efficient coding, and serve to foreground\ncommunication processes that utilize random walk dynamics constrained by\nnetwork connectivity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jan 2020 23:01:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 2021 21:19:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-04"}

To address this problem, we present a\nproposal learning approach to learn proposal features and predictions from both\nlabeled and unlabeled data. The approach consists of a self-supervised proposal\nlearning module and a consistency-based proposal learning module. In the\nself-supervised proposal learning module, we present a proposal location loss\nand a contrastive loss to learn context-aware and noise-robust proposal\nfeatures respectively. In the consistency-based proposal learning module, we\napply consistency losses to both bounding box classification and regression\npredictions of proposals to learn noise-robust proposal features and\npredictions.

We found statistically better\nperformance of ph-AFQMC with complex-restricted orbitals than with\nspin-unrestricted orbitals. We then showed the utilization of essential spin\nsymmetry breaking when computing the single-triplet gap of a known\nbiradicaloid, C$_{36}$. ph-AFQMC with spin-unrestricted Hartree-Fock\n(ph-AFQMC+UHF) fails catastrophically even with spin-projection and predicts no\nbiradicaloid character.

Motivated by such observations, we propose a kinetic theory\nthat addresses the non-adiabatic evolution of a nearly collisionless plasma\nexpanding from a central thermal source. We concentrate on the dynamics of\nenergetic electrons propagating along a radially diverging magnetic flux tube.\nDue to the conservation of their magnetic moments, the electrons form a beam\ncollimated along the magnetic field lines. Due to weak energy exchange with the\nbackground plasma, the beam population slowly loses its energy and heats the\nbackground plasma. We propose that no matter how weak the collisions are, at\nlarge enough distances from the source a universal regime of expansion is\nestablished where the electron temperature declines as $T_e(r)\\propto\nr^{-2/5}$. This is close to the observed scaling of the solar wind temperature\nin the inner heliosphere.

The first normalizing flow designs used coupling layer mappings\nbuilt upon affine transformations. The significant advantage of such models is\ntheir easy-to-compute inverse. Nevertheless, making use of affine\ntransformations may limit the expressiveness of such models. Recently,\ninvertible piecewise polynomial functions as a replacement for affine\ntransformations have attracted attention. However, these methods require\nsolving a polynomial equation to calculate their inverse. In this paper, we\nexplore using linear rational splines as a replacement for affine\ntransformations used in coupling layers.

The methodology relies on a series of deep adversarial neural network\narchitecture with physics-based regularization. The network is used to simulate\nthe dynamic behavior of physical quantities (i.e. saturation) subject to a set\nof governing laws (e.g. mass conservation) and corresponding boundary and\ninitial conditions. A residual equation is formed from the governing\npartial-differential equation and used as part of the training. Derivatives of\nthe estimated physical quantities are computed using automatic differentiation\nalgorithms. This allows the model to avoid overfitting, by reducing the\nvariance and permits extrapolation beyond the range of the training data\nincluding uncertainty implicitely derived from the distribution output of the\ngenerative adversarial networks. The approach is used to simulate a 2 phase\nimmiscible transport problem (Buckley Leverett). From a very limited dataset,\nthe model learns the parameters of the governing equation and is able to\nprovide an accurate physical solution, both in terms of shock and rarefaction.\nWe demonstrate how this method can be applied in the context of a forward\nsimulation for continuous problems. The use of these models for the inverse\nproblem is also presented, where the model simultaneously learns the physical\nlaws and determines key uncertainty subsurface parameters. The proposed\nmethodology is a simple and elegant way to instill physical knowledge to\nmachine-learning algorithms. This alleviates the two most significant\nshortcomings of machine-learning algorithms: the requirement for large datasets\nand the reliability of extrapolation. The principles presented in this paper\ncan be generalized in innumerable ways in the future and should lead to a new\nclass of algorithms to solve both forward and inverse physical problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jan 2020 08:20:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-16"}

A straightforward yet\nnaive solution to this problem is to employ a truncated MAC which undesirably\nsacrifices cryptographic strength in exchange for reduced communication\noverhead. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a novel approach\nfor message authentication called \\textit{Cumulative Message Authentication\nCode} (CuMAC), which consists of two distinctive procedures:\n\\textit{aggregation} and \\textit{accumulation}. In aggregation, a sender\ngenerates compact authentication tags from segments of multiple MACs by using a\nsystematic encoding procedure. In accumulation, a receiver accumulates the\ncryptographic strength of the underlying MAC by collecting and verifying the\nauthentication tags. Embodied with these two procedures, CuMAC enables the\nreceiver to achieve an advantageous trade-off between the cryptographic\nstrength and the latency in processing of the authentication tags. Furthermore,\nfor some latency-sensitive messages where this trade-off may be unacceptable,\nwe propose a variant of CuMAC that we refer to as \\textit{CuMAC with\nSpeculation} (CuMAC/S). In addition to the aggregation and accumulation\nprocedures, CuMAC/S enables the sender and receiver to employ a speculation\nprocedure for predicting future message values and pre-computing the\ncorresponding MAC segments. For the messages which can be reliably speculated,\nCuMAC/S significantly reduces the MAC verification latency without compromising\nthe cryptographic strength. We have carried out comprehensive evaluation of\nCuMAC and CuMAC/S through simulation and a prototype implementation on a real\ncar.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jan 2020 10:17:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Oct 2020 00:28:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-16"}

This arises first because BVSW are\ninductively transduced less efficiently than DESWs. Also, in the range of\nwavevectors (~5 rad. um-1) typically excited by our antennas, the group\nvelocity of BVSWs stays lower than that of DESW, which leads to reduced\npropagation ability that impact transmission signals in an exponential manner.\nIn contrast, the group velocity of DESWs is maximum at low fields and decreases\ncontinuously with the applied field. The essential features of the measured SW\ncharacteristics are well reciprocated by a simple, 1-D analytical model which\ncan be used to assess the potential of each configuration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jan 2020 10:37:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Jun 2021 06:22:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-04"}

Klein et al. described a simple algorithm that, for\nfixed codeword lengths, finds a skeleton tree with the least number of nodes;\nwith this algorithm one can process each set of optimal codeword lengths to\nfind an optimal skeleton tree.

We describe an $O(n^2\\log n)$-time algorithm that, given $n$\nsymbol frequencies, constructs an optimal skeleton tree and its corresponding\noptimal code.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jan 2020 11:13:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Mar 2020 15:28:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-25"}

Because of its typical drift\nlength of several meters, relatively large cathode voltages are desirable to\nprovide a sizeable drift field. Current designs are based on feedthroughs with\nhigh voltages (HV) limited to several hundred kV. The present work proposes a\nnovel method to produce higher voltages inside the detector. It is based on a\nVan de Graaff HV generator where the charge transporting belt is replaced by a\ncryogenic LAr flow. Negative charge is injected in liquid by means of a\ngrounded sharp point facing a positive voltage electrode with a high speed LAr\nstream in between. The LAr flow transports the charge to the cathode through an\nelectrically insulating pipe. In the cathode the charge is extracted with a\nmetallic mesh. The LAr flux is driven by a cryogenic helium pump with\nunidirectional valves assuring a continuous flow. The LAr operational\ntemperature is maintained by a pressurized liquid nitrogen deposit with\nautomatic filling. The whole system is installed within a dewar container that\nwill be filled with LAr reproducing the typical TPC conditions. This design has\nno mobile parts, so it is very robust and can be easily embedded within the\nstructural support of a TPC cathode. A prototype of this HV generator has been\nconstructed at CIEMAT (Madrid), and is currently being characterized.

One of the most\nimportant challenges in the insurance industry is to address liability\nchallenge and the forging of documents by the involved parties, i.e., insurance\ncompany or the users, in order to increase financial gain. Conventional methods\nto address this challenge is significantly time consuming and costly and also\nsuffers from lock of transparency.

BIS creates a big\numbrella that consists of the smart city managers, insurance companies, users,\nand sensors and devices. The users are known by changeable Public Keys (PKs)\nthat introduces a level of anonymity. The data collected by the sensors is\nstored in cloud or local storage and is shared with insurance company on demand\nto find the liable party that in turn increases the privacy of the users. BIS\nenables the users to prove and share the history of their insurances with other\nusers or insurances.

By how much these coefficients can be perturbed is\ndetermined via an associated max-times polynomial and its tropical roots. An\nalgorithm is designed for computing the roots of $p(z)$. It uses a companion\nlinearization $C(z) = A-zB$ of $p(z)$ to which we added an extra zero leading\ncoefficient, and an appropriate two-sided diagonal scaling that balances $A$\nand makes $B$ graded in particular when there is variation in the magnitude of\nthe coefficients of $p(z)$.

Due to the\nfundamental significance, it has drawn much attention in the field of network\nanalysis and mining. Some related works appeared in recent years have\nsignificantly advanced our understanding of how to predict the strong and weak\nties in the social networks. However, most of the proposed approaches are\nscenario-aware methods heavily depending on some special contexts and even\nexclusively used in social networks. As a result, they are less applicable to\nvarious kinds of networks.\n  In contrast to the prior studies, here we propose a new computational\nframework called Neighborhood Estimating Weight (NEW) which is purely driven by\nthe basic structure information of the network and has the flexibility for\nadapting to diverse types of networks. In NEW, we design a novel index, i.e.,\nconnection inclination, to generate the representative features of the network,\nwhich is capable of capturing the actual distribution of the tie strength. In\norder to obtain the optimized prediction results, we also propose a\nparameterized regression model which approximately has a linear time complexity\nand thus is readily extended to the implementation in large-scale networks. The\nexperimental results on six real-world networks demonstrate that our proposed\npredictive model outperforms the state of the art methods, which is powerful\nfor predicting the missing tie strengths when only a part of the network's tie\nstrength information is available.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jan 2020 13:02:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-16"}

We base our work on the popular Bloom-Filter templates\nprotection & address the key challenges like sub-optimal performance and low\nunlinkability. Specifically, we focus on cases where Bloom-filter templates\nresults in non-ideal performance due to presence of large degradations within\niris images. Iris recognition is challenged with number of occluding factors\nsuch as presence of eye-lashes within captured image, occlusion due to eyelids,\nlow quality iris images due to motion blur. All of such degrading factors\nresult in obtaining non-reliable iris codes & thereby provide non-ideal\nbiometric performance. These factors directly impact the protected templates\nderived from iris images when classical Bloom-filters are employed. To this\nend, we propose and extend our earlier ideas of Morton-filters for obtaining\nbetter and reliable templates for iris. Morton filter based TP for iris codes\nis based on leveraging the intra and inter-class distribution by exploiting\nlow-rank iris codes to derive the stable bits across iris images for a\nparticular subject and also analyzing the discriminable bits across various\nsubjects. Such low-rank non-noisy iris codes enables realizing the template\nprotection in a superior way which not only can be used in constrained setting,\nbut also in relaxed iris imaging.

In this way, we are\nable to continue all of the basic planar homoclinic motions into the spatial\nproblem as homoclinics for appropriate vertical Lyapunov orbits which, by the\nSmale Tangle theorem, suggest the existence of chaotic motions in the spatial\nproblem. While the saddle-focus equilibrium solutions in the planar problems\noccur only at a discrete set of energy levels, the cycle-to-cycle homoclinics\nin the spatial problem are robust with respect to small changes in energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jan 2020 13:26:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-05"}

One such method is case-based reasoning (CBR) where the similarity\nmeasure is used to retrieve the stored case or set of cases most similar to the\nquery case. Describing a similarity measure analytically is challenging, even\nfor domain experts working with CBR experts. However, data sets are typically\ngathered as part of constructing a CBR or machine learning system. These\ndatasets are assumed to contain the features that correctly identify the\nsolution from the problem features, thus they may also contain the knowledge to\nconstruct or learn such a similarity measure. The main motivation for this work\nis to automate the construction of similarity measures using machine learning,\nwhile keeping training time as low as possible. Our objective is to investigate\nhow to apply machine learning to effectively learn a similarity measure. Such a\nlearned similarity measure could be used for CBR systems, but also for\nclustering data in semi-supervised learning, or one-shot learning tasks. Recent\nwork has advanced towards this goal, relies on either very long training times\nor manually modeling parts of the similarity measure. We created a framework to\nhelp us analyze current methods for learning similarity measures. This analysis\nresulted in two novel similarity measure designs. One design using a\npre-trained classifier as basis for a similarity measure. The second design\nuses as little modeling as possible while learning the similarity measure from\ndata and keeping training time low. Both similarity measures were evaluated on\n14 different datasets. The evaluation shows that using a classifier as basis\nfor a similarity measure gives state of the art performance. Finally the\nevaluation shows that our fully data-driven similarity measure design\noutperforms state of the art methods while keeping training time low.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jan 2020 13:29:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-16"}

In order to\ndetermine the zircon stability in such natural systems, we have performed\nhigh-temperature experiments of zircon dissolution in natural mid-ocean ridge\nbasaltic and synthetic haplobasaltic melts coupled with in situ electron probe\nmicroanalyses of the experimental products at high current.\n  Taking into account the secondary fluorescence effect in zircon glass pairs\nduring electron microprobe analysis, we have calculated zirconium diffusion\ncoefficient necessary to predict zircon survival in asthenospheric melts of\ntholeiitic basalt composition. The data imply that typical 100 micron zircons\ndissolve rapidly (in 10 hours) and congruently upon the reaction with basaltic\nmelt at mantle pressures. We observed incongruent (to crystal ZrO2 and SiO2 in\nmelt) dissolution of zircon in natural mid-ocean ridge basaltic melt at low\npressures and in haplobasaltic melt at elevated pressure. Our experimental data\nraise questions about the origin of zircons in mafic and ultramafic rocks, in\nparticular, in shallow oceanic asthenosphere and deep lithosphere, as well as\nthe meaning of the zircon-based ages estimated from the composition of these\nminerals. Large size zircon megacrysts in kimberlites, peridotites, alkali\nbasalts and other magmas suggest the fast transport and short interaction\nbetween zircon and melt.The origin of zircon megacrysts is likely related to\nmetasomatic addition of Zr into mantle as any mantle melting episode should\nobliterate them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 15 Jan 2020 14:15:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-09"}

A similar phenomenon is known to show up\nin so-called electric discrete-time quantum walks (DQWs); this phenomenon will\nbe referred to as DQW Bloch oscillations. This similarity is particularly\nsalient when the electric field of the DQW is weak. For a wide, i.e., spatially\nextended initial condition, one numerically observes semi-classical\noscillations, i.e., oscillations of a localized particle, both for the electric\nTBH and the electric DQW. More precisely: The numerical simulations strongly\nsuggest that the semi-classical DQW Bloch oscillations correspond to two\ncounter-propagating semi-classical TBH Bloch oscillations. In this work it is\nshown that, under certain assumptions, the solution of the electric DQW for a\nweak electric field and a wide initial condition is well approximated by the\nsuperposition of two continuous-time expressions, which are counter-propagating\nsolutions of an electric TBH whose hopping amplitude is the cosine of the\narbitrary coin-operator mixing angle.

Also, sensor nodes distribute based on\nnetwork usage. One of the most significant issues in this type of network is\nthe energy consumption of sensor nodes. In fixed-sink networks, nodes which are\nnear the sink act as an interface to transfer data of other nodes to sink. This\ncauses the energy consumption of sensors reduces rapidly. Therefore, the\nlifetime of the network declines. Sensor nodes owing to their weaknesses are\nsusceptible to several threats, one of which is denial-of-sleep attack (DoSA)\nthreatening WSN. Hence, the DoSA refers to the energy loss in these nodes by\nmaintaining the nodes from entering energy-saving and sleep mode. In this\npaper, a hybrid approach is proposed based on mobile sink, firefly algorithm\nbased on leach, and Hopfield neural network (WSN-FAHN). Thus, mobile sink is\napplied to both improve energy consumption and increase network lifetime.\nFirefly algorithm is proposed to cluster nodes and authenticate in two levels\nto prevent from DoSA.

Quantification methods assume that the sensitivities and\nspecificities of the classifier are either perfect or transportable from the\ntraining to the test population. These assumptions are inappropriate in the\npresence of dataset shift, when the misclassification rates in the training\npopulation are not representative of those for the test population.\nQuantification under dataset shift has been addressed only for single-class\n(categorical) predictions and assuming perfect knowledge of the true labels on\na small subset of the test population. We propose generalized Bayes\nquantification learning (GBQL) that uses the entire compositional predictions\nfrom probabilistic classifiers and allows for uncertainty in true class labels\nfor the limited labeled test data.

While LFS at atmospheric and elevated pressures are\nextensively investigated, experimental measurements of ESR with counterflow\npremixed flames are very limited for flame instability often occurs near\nextinction, especially at high pressures. Due to the scarcity of ESR\nmeasurements, most combustion kinetic models are mainly validated and optimized\nagainst LFS. However, it is questionable whether the controlling reactions are\nthe same for ESR and LFS such that those models are also valid for predicting\nESR. This work quantifies the kinetic similarities between ESR and LFS by\nanalyzing their kinetic sensitivity directions. The direction is represented by\na unit vector composed of the normalized sensitivity of ESR or LFS to the rate\nconstant for each elemental reaction. Consequently, the similarity between the\ntwo directions is measured by the inner product of the corresponding unit\nvectors. The sensitivity directions of ESR and LFS are found parallel for\nvarious fuels, equivalence ratios, and pressures. Furthermore, sensitivity\ndirections at various strain rates are also similar for the maximum\ntemperature, local temperature at various locations in the flame coordinate,\nand ESR in counterflow premixed flames. These findings suggest that LFS and ESR\nare similarly effective as the target for constraining and optimizing rate\nconstants in kinetic models.

In this paper, we propose an outlier detection\nensemble framework with embedded feature selection (ODEFS), to address this\nissue. Specifically, for each random sub-sampling based learning component,\nODEFS unifies feature selection and outlier detection into a pairwise ranking\nformulation to learn feature subsets that are tailored for the outlier\ndetection method. Moreover, we adopt the thresholded self-paced learning to\nsimultaneously optimize feature selection and example selection, which is\nhelpful to improve the reliability of the training set. After that, we design\nan alternate algorithm with proved convergence to solve the resultant\noptimization problem. In addition, we analyze the generalization error bound of\nthe proposed framework, which provides theoretical guarantee on the method and\ninsightful practical guidance.

The values of the gluon condensate <\\alpha_s\nG^2> from the (axial)-vector charmonium channels combined with previous\ndeterminations in Table 1, leads to the new QSSR average [1]: <\\alpha_s\nG^2>_average=(6.35\\pm 0.35)x 10^{-2} GeV^4. Our results clarify the (apparent)\ndiscrepancies between different estimates of <\\alpha_s G^2> from J/\\psi sum\nrule but also shows the sensitivity of the sum rules on the choice of the\n\\mu-subtraction scale.

Moreover, many machine learning\nalgorithms and tools that are developed for complex networks try to take\nadvantage of the existence of communities to improve their performance or\nspeed. As a result, there are many competing algorithms for detecting\ncommunities in large networks. Unfortunately, these algorithms are often quite\nsensitive and so they cannot be fine-tuned for a given, but a constantly\nchanging, real-world network at hand. It is therefore important to test these\nalgorithms for various scenarios that can only be done using synthetic graphs\nthat have built-in community structure, power-law degree distribution, and\nother typical properties observed in complex networks. The standard and\nextensively used method for generating artificial networks is the LFR graph\ngenerator. Unfortunately, this model has some scalability limitations and it is\nchallenging to analyze it theoretically. Finally, the mixing parameter $\\mu$,\nthe main parameter of the model guiding the strength of the communities, has a\nnon-obvious interpretation and so can lead to unnaturally-defined networks.

Early\napproaches relied on utilizing each user's first-order social neighbors'\ninterests for better user modeling and failed to model the social influence\ndiffusion process from the global social network structure. Recently, we\npropose a preliminary work of a neural influence diffusion network (i.e.,\nDiffNet) for social recommendation (Diffnet), which models the recursive social\ndiffusion process to capture the higher-order relationships for each user.\nHowever, we argue that, as users play a central role in both user-user social\nnetwork and user-item interest network, only modeling the influence diffusion\nprocess in the social network would neglect the users' latent collaborative\ninterests in the user-item interest network. In this paper, we propose\nDiffNet++, an improved algorithm of DiffNet that models the neural influence\ndiffusion and interest diffusion in a unified framework. By reformulating the\nsocial recommendation as a heterogeneous graph with social network and interest\nnetwork as input, DiffNet++ advances DiffNet by injecting these two network\ninformation for user embedding learning at the same time. This is achieved by\niteratively aggregating each user's embedding from three aspects: the user's\nprevious embedding, the influence aggregation of social neighbors from the\nsocial network, and the interest aggregation of item neighbors from the\nuser-item interest network. Furthermore, we design a multi-level attention\nnetwork that learns how to attentively aggregate user embeddings from these\nthree aspects.
