Exactly how\nthese COM form remains an open question. This study aims to constrain the\nformation of complex organic molecules through comparisons of their abundances\ntowards the Class 0 protostellar binary IRAS 16293-2422 (IRAS16293). We\nutilised observations from the ALMA Protostellar Interferometric Line Survey of\nIRAS16293. The species identification and the rotational temperature and column\ndensity estimation were derived by fitting the extracted spectra towards\nIRAS16293 A and IRAS16293 B with synthetic spectra. The majority of the work in\nthis paper pertains to the analysis of IRAS16293 A for a comparison with the\nresults from the other binary component, which have already been published. We\ndetect 15 different COM, as well as 16 isotopologues towards the most luminous\ncompanion protostar IRAS16293 A. Tentative detections of an additional 11\nisotopologues are reported. We also searched for and report on the first\ndetections of CH3OCH2OH and t-C2H5OCH3 towards IRAS16293 B and the follow-up\ndetection of CH2DCHO and CH3CDO. Twenty-four lines of CHD2OH are also\nidentified. The comparison between the two protostars of the binary system\nshows significant differences in abundance for some of the species, which are\npartially correlated to their spatial distribution. The spatial distribution is\nconsistent with the sublimation temperature of the species; those with higher\nexpected sublimation temperatures are located in the most compact region of the\nhot corino towards IRAS16293 A. This spatial differentiation is not resolved in\nIRAS16293 B and will require observations at a higher angular resolution. In\nparallel, the list of identified CHD2OH lines shows the need of accurate\nspectroscopic data including their line strength.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jan 2020 16:16:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-11"}

Several deep\nlearning methods for background subtraction have been proposed in the\nliterature with competitive performances. However, these models show\nperformance degradation when tested on unseen videos; and they require huge\namount of data to avoid overfitting. Recently, graph-based algorithms have been\nsuccessful approaching unsupervised and semi-supervised learning problems.\nFurthermore, the theory of graph signal processing and semi-supervised learning\nhave been combined leading to new insights in the field of machine learning.

Here we report on a continuing monitoring campaign with the Neil\nGehrels Swift Observatory X-ray Telescope in which we observe two new outbursts\nfrom this source. The first outburst occurred in 2016 July, and the second in\n2017 December, reaching peak 0.5-10 keV absorbed fluxes of\n$3.2^{+0.2}_{-0.3}\\times 10^{-11}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ and\n$2.2^{+0.2}_{-0.2}\\times10^{-11}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$, respectively, factors\nof $\\sim$5 and $\\sim 4$ above the quiescent flux.

A\ntypical analysis of FCM data involves cell classification---that is, the\nidentification of cell subgroups in the sample---and comparisons of the cell\nsubgroups across samples or conditions. While modern experiments often\nnecessitate the collection and processing of samples in multiple batches,\nanalysis of FCM data across batches is challenging because differences across\nsamples may occur due to either true biological variation or technical reasons\nsuch as antibody lot effects or instrument optics across batches. Thus a\ncritical step in comparative analyses of multi-sample FCM data---yet missing in\nexisting automated methods for analyzing such data---is cross-sample\ncalibration, whose goal is to align corresponding cell subsets across multiple\nsamples in the presence of technical variations, so that biological variations\ncan be meaningfully compared.

Three\nimportant features of our method make it particularly effective for analyzing\nmulti-sample FCM data: a nonparametric mixture avoids prespecifying the number\nof cell clusters; a hierarchical skew normal kernel that allows flexibility in\nthe shapes of the cell subsets and cross-sample variation in their locations;\nand finally the \"coarsening\" strategy makes inference robust to departures from\nthe model such as heavy-tailness not captured by the skew normal kernels.

The reverberation timescale is set by\nthe light travel path between the direct emission from a hot X-ray corona and\nthe reprocessed emission from the inner edge of the accretion disc. However,\nthere is an inherent degeneracy in the reverberation signal between black hole\nmass, inner disc radius and height of the illuminating corona above the disc.\nHere, we use a long X-ray observation of the highly-variable active galaxy,\nIRAS 13224-3809, to track the reverberation signal as the system evolves on\ntimescales of a day. With the inclusion of all the relativistic effects,\nmodelling reveals that the height of the X-ray corona increases with increasing\nluminosity, providing a dynamic view of the inner accretion region. This\nsimultaneous modelling allows us to break the inherent degeneracies and obtain\nan independent timing-based estimate for the mass and spin of the black hole.\nThe uncertainty on black hole mass is comparable to the leading optical\nreverberation method, making X-ray reverberation a powerful technique,\nparticularly for sources with low optical variability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jan 2020 17:54:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 2020 12:28:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-22"}

However, these pipelines consume enormous computing\nresources due to the alternately learning process for spatial and temporal\ninformation. One natural question is whether we can embed the temporal\ninformation into the spatial one so the information in the two domains can be\njointly learned once-only. In this work, we answer this question by presenting\na simple yet powerful operator -- temporal interlacing network (TIN). Instead\nof learning the temporal features, TIN fuses the two kinds of information by\ninterlacing spatial representations from the past to the future, and vice\nversa. A differentiable interlacing target can be learned to control the\ninterlacing process. In this way, a heavy temporal model is replaced by a\nsimple interlacing operator.

One possibility\nto explain this anomaly would be the presence of a scalar $\\phi$ with mass of\nthe order of the pion mass and inducing decays $K_L \\to \\pi^0 \\phi$ which mimic\nthe observed signal.A scalar with mass of the order of the pion mass and a\ncoupling to muons of the order of the Standard Model Higgs coupling could also\nexplain the muon anomalous magnetic moment anomaly $(g-2)_{\\mu}$. We built on\nthese facts to show that a light singlet scalar with couplings to the leptons\nand quarks as the ones induced by mixing with Higgs states in two Higgs doublet\nmodels may lead to an explanation of both anomalies. More specifically, we show\nthat this is the case in the so-called type-X models in which leptons and\nquarks couple to two different Higgs doublets, and for scalar masses that are\nin the range between 40 and 70 MeV. Due to the relatively large coupling to\nleptons required to fit $(g-2)_{\\mu}$, the scalar lifetime accidentally falls\ninto the sub-nanosecond range which is essential to evade the severe proton\nbeam dump experiments and astrophysical constraints, though it becomes\nsensitive to constraints from electron beam dump experiments.

Significant diffusivity and kurtosis time-dependence is observed for\n$t=21.2$-100 ms, and is characterized by a power-law tail $\\sim t^{-\\vartheta}$\nwith dynamical exponent $\\vartheta$.

The estimated\npower-law dynamical exponent $\\vartheta\\simeq1/2$ in both $D(t)$ and $K(t)$ is\nconsistent with one-dimensional diffusion in the presence of randomly\npositioned restrictions along neurites.

AGN as a central heating source are key to\npreventing runaway cooling flows, but their role in heating cores in a\ncosmological context is still poorly understood. The activity of the AGN is\nstrongly linked to star formation, especially in the Brightest Cluster Galaxy\n(BCG), likely because both rely on cold phase gas. A self-consistent model for\nAGN and star formation in galaxy clusters thus requires cosmological context,\nhigher resolution, and a careful modeling of cooling and heating balance. In\nthis paper, we use the high-resolution hydrodynamical cosmological simulation\nof the RomulusC galaxy cluster to study in detail the role of AGN and a major,\nhead-on merger in shaping the cluster core. The unprecedented resolution of the\nRomulusC simulation captures the multiphase structure of the ICM. The realistic\nlarge-scale outflows launched by very small-scale thermal injections, the\nimproved modeling of turbulent diffusion and mixing, and the particle nature of\nthe simulation allow us to carefully separate different heating channels. We\nshow that AGN activity, while efficient at regulating star formation, is\nincapable of destroying a CC. Instead, that process is facilitated by a\nhead-on, 1:8 mass ratio merger. The merger generates bulk and turbulent\nmotions, which in turn mix high entropy gas generated by AGN and merger driven\nshocks, turbulent dissipation and sloshing of the ICM by infalling\nsubstructures. While central cooling times remain shorter than the Hubble time,\nrestoring a CC is made more difficult by the reduced precipitation rates at\nlarger radii, emphasizing that the AGN-ICM connection is truly a multi-scale\nproblem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jan 2020 21:06:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Apr 2021 16:36:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-19"}

The performances of participating\nmodels decrease significantly for cross-modality tasks for the liver (DICE:\n0.88 $\\pm$ 0.15 MSSD: 36.33 $\\pm$ 21.97 mm) and all organs (DICE: 0.85 $\\pm$\n0.21 MSSD: 33.17 $\\pm$ 38.93 mm). Despite contrary examples on different\napplications, multi-tasking DL models designed to segment all organs seem to\nperform worse compared to organ-specific ones (performance drop around 5\\%).\nBesides, such directions of further research for cross-modality segmentation\nwould significantly support real-world clinical applications. Moreover, having\nmore than 1500 participants, another important contribution of the paper is the\nanalysis on shortcomings of challenge organizations such as the effects of\nmultiple submissions and peeking phenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jan 2020 21:11:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 9 May 2020 10:33:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 7 Jan 2021 14:30:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-08"}

Numerical results corroborate the effectiveness of\nthe proposed channel estimation methods and highlight the involved tradeoffs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jan 2020 23:23:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-22"}

However, the profile of density in the radiation dominated universe\nshows that EMSG supports inflationary cosmology. Inflationary cosmological\nmodels are successful in providing convincing answers to major cosmological\nissues like horizon problem, flatness problem and small value of cosmological\nconstant but hitherto no model of inflation has been observationally confirmed.\nOwing to this, Varying Speed of Light (VSL) were introduced which are a class\nof cosmological models which disfavor inflation and propose an alternative\nroute to solve these cosmological issues by just allowing the speed of light\n(and Newtonian Gravitational constant) to vary. VSL theories were motivated to\naddress the shortcomings of inflation but do not address the shortcomings\nrelated to the initial big bang singularity. In this spirit, we present here a\nnovel cosmological model which is free from both the \"initial big bang\nsingularity\" and \"inflation\" by incorporating a mutually varying speed of light\n$c(t)$ and Newtonian gravitational constant $G(t)$ in the framework of EMSG. We\nreport that in EMSG, for a dust universe ($\\omega=0$), cosmological models for\na time varying $c(t)$ and $G(t)$ and constant $c$ and $G$ are\nindistinguishable, whereas for a radiation dominated universe ($\\omega = 1/3$),\na mutually varying $c(t)$ and $G(t)$ provides an exiting alternative to\ninflationary cosmology which is also free from initial big bang singularity. We\nfurther report that for an ansatz of scale factor representing a bouncing\ncosmological model, the VSL theory can be applied to a quadratic $T$ gravity\nmodel to get rid of \"inflation\" and \"big bang singularity\" and concurrently\nsolve the above mentioned cosmological enigmas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Jan 2020 00:51:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-22"}

We find that these\nspecial scenarios are characterized by distinctive features in the optical\nconductivity spectrum, which enable an unambiguous experimental verification.\nIn both types of quantum structures, we discuss the dependence of the occurring\npersistent charge and spin currents on an axial magnetic field and Fermi energy\nwhich show clear fingerprints of the electronic subband structure. Here, the\nspin-preserving symmetries become manifest in the vanishing of certain spin\ncurrent tensor components. Our analytic description relates the distinctive\nfeatures of the optical conductivity and persistent currents to bandstructure\ncharacteristics which allows to deduce spin-orbit coefficients and other band\nparameters from measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Jan 2020 01:16:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 May 2020 22:40:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-13"}

Therefore, inferring the complete network\nstructure is useful for understanding complex systems. The existing studies\nhave not fully solved the problem of inferring network structure with partial\nor no information about connections or nodes. In this paper, we tackle the\nproblem by utilizing time series data generated by network dynamics. We regard\nthe network inference problem based on dynamical time series data as a problem\nof minimizing errors for predicting future states and proposed a novel\ndata-driven deep learning model called Gumbel Graph Network (GGN) to solve the\ntwo kinds of network inference problems: Network Reconstruction and Network\nCompletion. For the network reconstruction problem, the GGN framework includes\ntwo modules: the dynamics learner and the network generator. For the network\ncompletion problem, GGN adds a new module called the States Learner to infer\nmissing parts of the network. We carried out experiments on discrete and\ncontinuous time series data. The experiments show that our method can\nreconstruct up to 100% network structure on the network reconstruction task.\nWhile the model can also infer the unknown parts of the structure with up to\n90% accuracy when some nodes are missing. And the accuracy decays with the\nincrease of the fractions of missing nodes.

Typically, no single design performs well in all\nobjectives; therefore, finding Pareto-optimal designs is of interest. The\nsearch for Pareto-optimal designs involves evaluating designs in an iterative\nprocess, and the measurements are used to evaluate an acquisition function that\nguides the search process. However, measuring different objectives incurs\ndifferent costs. For example, the cost of measuring the prediction error of\nDNNs is orders of magnitude higher than that of measuring the energy\nconsumption of a pre-trained DNN, as it requires re-training the DNN. Current\nstate-of-the-art methods do not consider this difference in objective\nevaluation cost, potentially incurring expensive evaluations of objective\nfunctions in the optimization process. In this paper, we develop a novel\ndecoupled and cost-aware multi-objective optimization algorithm, we call\nFlexible Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization (FlexiBO) to address this issue.\nFlexiBO weights the improvement of the hypervolume of the Pareto region by the\nmeasurement cost of each objective to balance the expense of collecting new\ninformation with the knowledge gained through objective evaluations, preventing\nus from performing expensive measurements for little to no gain.

Our results indicate that,\ngiven the same total experimental budget, FlexiBO discovers designs with\n4.8$\\%$ to 12.4$\\%$ lower hypervolume error than the best method in\nstate-of-the-art multi-objective optimization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Jan 2020 03:26:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Aug 2022 07:23:55 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 21 Aug 2022 16:32:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-23"}

The\northo-H2O(423-330) line at 448 GHz, which was recently detected in a local\nluminous infrared galaxy (Pereira-Santaella et al. 2017), offers a unique\nconstraint on the excitation conditions and ISM properties in deeply buried\ngalaxy nuclei since the line requires high far-IR optical depths to be excited.\nIn this letter, we report the first high-redshift detection of the 448 GHz\nH2O(423-330) line using ALMA, in a strongly lensed submillimeter galaxy (SMG)\nat z=3.63. After correcting for magnification, the luminosity of the 448 GHz\nH2O line is ~10^6 L_sun. In combination with three other previously detected\nH2O lines, we build a model that \"resolves\" the dusty ISM structure of the SMG,\nand find that it is composed of a ~1 kpc optically thin (optical depth at\n100{\\mu}m {\\tau}_{100}~0.3) disk component with dust temperature T_{dust}\n\\approx 50 K emitting a total infrared power of 5e12 L_sun with surface density\n\\Sigma_{IR}=4e11 L_sun kpc^{-2}, and a very compact (0.1 kpc) heavily\ndust-obscured ({\\tau}_{100} \\gtrsim 1) nuclear core with very warm dust (100 K)\nand \\Sigma_{IR}=8e12 L_sun kpc^{-2}. The H2O abundance in the core component,\nX_{H2O}~(0.3-5)e{-5}, is at least one order of magnitude higher than in the\ndisk component. The optically thick core has the characteristic properties of\nan Eddington-limited starburst, providing evidence that radiation pressure on\ndust is capable of supporting the ISM in buried nuclei at high redshifts.

In addition, the propagation\nchannel in mmWave frequencies incorporates only a few number of spatial\nclusters requiring a procedure to align the corresponding narrow beams with the\nangle of departure (AoD) of the channel clusters. The objective of this\nprocedure, called beam alignment (BA) is to increase the beamforming gain for\nsubsequent data communication. Several prior studies consider optimizing BA\nprocedure to achieve various objectives such as reducing the BA overhead,\nincreasing throughput, and reducing power consumption. While these studies\nmostly provide optimized BA schemes for scenarios with a single active user,\nthere are often multiple active users in practical networks. Consequently, it\nis more efficient in terms of BA overhead and delay to design multi-user BA\nschemes which can perform beam management for multiple users collectively. This\npaper considers a class of multi-user BA schemes where the base station\nperforms a one shot scan of the angular domain to simultaneously localize\nmultiple users. The objective is to minimize the average of expected width of\nremaining uncertainty regions (UR) on the AoDs after receiving users'\nfeedbacks.

Furthermore, identification rate is\ntask-dependent, and is low when distinct cognitive states, as captured by\ndifferent fMRI tasks, are compared. Here we propose an embedding framework,\nGEFF (Graph Embedding for Functional Fingerprinting), based on group-level\ndecomposition of FCs into eigenvectors. GEFF creates an eigenspace\nrepresentation of a group of subjects using one or more task FCs (Learning\nStage). In the Identification Stage, we compare new instances of FCs from the\nLearning subjects within this eigenspace (validation dataset). The validation\ndataset contains FCs either from the same tasks as the Learning dataset or from\nthe remaining tasks that were not included in Learning. Assessment of\nvalidation FCs within the eigenspace results in significantly increased\nsubject-identification rates for all fMRI tasks tested and potentially\ntask-independent fingerprinting process. It is noteworthy that combining\nresting-state with one fMRI task for GEFF Learning Stage covers most of the\ncognitive space for subject identification. In addition to\nsubject-identification, GEFF was also used for identification of cognitive\nstates, i.e. to identify the task associated to a given FC, regardless of the\nsubject being already in the Learning dataset or not (subject-independent\ntask-identification). In addition, we also show that eigenvectors from the\nLearning Stage can be characterized as task-dominant, subject dominant or\nneither, providing a deeper insight into the extent of variance in functional\nconnectivity across individuals and cognitive states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Jan 2020 05:35:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-22"}

This strategy is suitable for a\nmotion estimation problem where the motion is assumed smooth over time. Our\nstrategy exploits the temporal smoothness among image frames by following a\npredictor-corrector approach.

We incorporate matrix argument reductions (ARs) to force\nthe input matrices to satisfy the conditions, and develop theories for\naccelerating the ARs. The first algorithm uses the VBD based on a numerical\nspectral decomposition, and involves only cubic complexity under an assumption.\nThe second algorithm adopts the VBD based on a numerical Jordan decomposition,\nand is applicable even for defective matrices. Numerical results show\nefficiency and robustness of the algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Jan 2020 08:02:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-22"}

These models are usually designed to preserve the vertex\ninformation at different granularity and reduce the problems in discrete space\nto some machine learning tasks in continuous space. However, regardless of the\nfruitful progress, for some kind of graph applications, such as graph\ncompression and edge partition, it is very hard to reduce them to some graph\nrepresentation learning tasks. Moreover, these problems are closely related to\nreformulating a global layout for a specific graph, which is an important\nNP-hard combinatorial optimization problem: graph ordering. In this paper, we\npropose to attack the graph ordering problem behind such applications by a\nnovel learning approach.

We identified 125\nindividual light curves of Hilda asteroids observed by the K2 mission. We found\nthat despite of the mixed taxonomies, the Hilda group highly resembles to the\nTrojans in the distribution of rotation periods and amplitudes, and even the LR\ngroup (mostly C and X-type) Hildas follow this rule. Contrary to the Main Belt,\nHilda group lacks the very fast rotators. The ratio of extremely slow rotators\n(P>100 h) is a surprising 18%, which is unique in the Solar System. The\noccurrence rate of asteroids with multiple periods (4%) and asteroids with\nthree maxima in the light curves (5%) can be signs of high rate of binarity,\nwhich we can estimate as 25% within the Hilda group.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Jan 2020 12:09:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-18"}

First, the existing works often assume an\nunderlying information diffusion model, which is impractical in real world due\nto the complexity of information diffusion. Second, the existing works often\nignore the prediction of the infection order, which also plays an important\nrole in social network analysis. At last, the existing works often depend on\nthe requirement of underlying diffusion networks which are likely unobservable\nin practice. In this paper, we aim at the prediction of both node infection and\ninfection order without requirement of the knowledge about the underlying\ndiffusion mechanism and the diffusion network, where the challenges are\ntwo-fold. The first is what cascading characteristics of nodes should be\ncaptured and how to capture them, and the second is that how to model the\nnon-linear features of nodes in information cascades. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a novel model called Deep Collaborative Embedding (DCE)\nfor information cascade prediction, which can capture not only the node\nstructural property but also two kinds of node cascading characteristics. We\npropose an auto-encoder based collaborative embedding framework to learn the\nnode embeddings with cascade collaboration and node collaboration, in which way\nthe non-linearity of information cascades can be effectively captured.

By \"seeing\" many different analogy problems,\nalong with possible solutions, Analogator gradually develops an ability to make\nnew analogies. That is, it learns to make analogies by analogy. This approach\nstands in contrast to most existing research on analogy-making, in which\ntypically the a priori existence of analogical mechanisms within a model is\nassumed. The present research extends standard connectionist methodologies by\ndeveloping a specialized associative training procedure for a recurrent network\narchitecture. The network is trained to divide input scenes (or situations)\ninto appropriate figure and ground components. Seeing one scene in terms of a\nparticular figure and ground provides the context for seeing another in an\nanalogous fashion. After training, the model is able to make new analogies\nbetween novel situations. Analogator has much in common with lower-level\nperceptual models of categorization and recognition; it thus serves as a\nunifying framework encompassing both high-level analogical learning and\nlow-level perception. This approach is compared and contrasted with other\ncomputational models of analogy-making.

Because of its high sensitivity and large data rate, FAST\nrequires more accurate and efficient RFI flagging methods than its\ncounterparts. In the last decades, approaches based upon artificial\nintelligence (AI), such as codes using convolutional neural networks (CNNs),\nhave been proposed to identify RFI more reliably and efficiently. However, RFI\nflagging of FAST data with such methods has often proved to be erroneous, with\nfurther manual inspections required. In addition, network construction as well\nas preparation of training data sets for effective RFI flagging has imposed\nsignificant additional workloads. Therefore, rapid deployment and adjustment of\nAI approaches for different observations is impractical to implement with\nexisting algorithms.

Therefore,\nthis lack of knowledge and skills on how to produce and use videos for visual\ncommunication impedes the application of videos by software professionals in\nrequirements engineering.\n  How to Create Effective Videos and Vision Videos?: This technical report\naddresses this lack of knowledge and skills by software professionals. We\nprovide two guidelines that can be used as checklists to avoid frequent flaws\nin the production and use of videos respectively vision videos. Software\nprofessionals without special training should be able to follow these\nguidelines to achieve the basic capabilities to produce (vision) videos that\nare accepted by their stakeholders. These guidelines represent a core set of\nthose capabilities in the preproduction, shooting, postproduction, and viewing\nof (vision) videos. We do not strive for perfection in any of these\ncapabilities, .e.g., technical handling of video equipment, storytelling, or\nvideo editing. Instead, these guidelines support all steps of the (vision)\nvideo production and use process to a balanced way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Jan 2020 14:49:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Feb 2021 16:33:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-01"}

Usually, a cyber range\nsimulates one or more critical infrastructures that attacking (red) and\ndefending (blue) teams must compromise and protect, respectively. The\ninfrastructure can be physically assembled, but much more convenient is to rely\non the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) paradigm.

A detailed\nunderstanding of pinning is hence crucial with previous experiments being\neither limited in terms of controlled magnetic texture positioning or in terms\nof spatial resolution.

To solve the\ncomplex scale variations, single-shot detectors make scale-aware predictions\nbased on multiple pyramid layers. However, the features in the pyramid are not\nscale-aware enough, which limits the detection performance. Two common problems\nin single-shot detectors caused by object scale variations can be observed: (1)\nsmall objects are easily missed; (2) the salient part of a large object is\nsometimes detected as an object. With this observation, we propose a new\nNeighbor Erasing and Transferring (NET) mechanism to reconfigure the pyramid\nfeatures and explore scale-aware features. In NET, a Neighbor Erasing Module\n(NEM) is designed to erase the salient features of large objects and emphasize\nthe features of small objects in shallow layers. A Neighbor Transferring Module\n(NTM) is introduced to transfer the erased features and highlight large objects\nin deep layers. With this mechanism, a single-shot network called NETNet is\nconstructed for scale-aware object detection. In addition, we propose to\naggregate nearest neighboring pyramid features to enhance our NET. NETNet\nachieves 38.5% AP at a speed of 27 FPS and 32.0% AP at a speed of 55 FPS on MS\nCOCO dataset. As a result, NETNet achieves a better trade-off for real-time and\naccurate object detection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Jan 2020 15:21:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-22"}

This manner of changing the style of\nwritten text has gained significant attention in recent years. Yet these past\nresearch works largely cater to the transfer of single style attributes. The\ndisadvantage of focusing on a single style alone is that this often results in\ntarget text where other existing style attributes behave unpredictably or are\nunfairly dominated by the new style. To counteract this behavior, it would be\nnice to have a style transfer mechanism that can transfer or control multiple\nstyles simultaneously and fairly. Through such an approach, one could obtain\nobfuscated or written text incorporated with a desired degree of multiple soft\nstyles such as female-quality, politeness, or formalness.\n  In this work, we demonstrate that the transfer of multiple styles cannot be\nachieved by sequentially performing multiple single-style transfers.

Besides, the proposed model infers the network structure and\nmodels community evolution, manifested by appearances and disappearances of\ncommunities, using the discrete fragmentation coagulation process (DFCP). By\nintegrating the community structure with the group compatibility matrix we\nderive a generalized version of MMSB. An efficient Gibbs sampling scheme with\nPolya Gamma (PG) approach is implemented for posterior inference. We validate\nour model on synthetic and real world data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jan 2020 22:02:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-04"}

The agents generally have a unit supply/demand of a good that they want\nto exchange with other agents. On the other hand, Bochet et al. study a more\ngeneral version of the problem where they allow for agents to have arbitrary\nnumber of divisible goods to be rationed to other agents in the network. In\nthis current work, our main focus is on non-bipartite networks where agents\nhave arbitrary units of a homogeneous indivisible good that they want to\nexchange with their neighbors. Our aim is to develop mechanisms that would\nidentify a fair and strategyproof allocation for the agents in the network.\nThus, we generalize the kidney exchange problem to that of a network with\narbitrary capacity of available goods. Our main idea is that this problem and a\ncouple of other related versions of non-bipartite fair allocation problem can\nbe suitably transformed to one of fair allocations on bipartite networks for\nwhich we know of well studied fair allocation mechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 17 Jan 2020 22:41:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-10"}

The slow-down\nin Moore's law, and the availability of graphics processing units (GPUs)\ncapable of conducting general-purpose computations at high speed, has sparked\nconsiderable research efforts into the development of GPU-based ACO\nimplementations. In this paper, we discuss a range of novel ideas for improving\nthe GPU-based parallel MMAS implementation, allowing it to better utilize the\ncomputing power offered by two subsequent Nvidia GPU architectures.\nSpecifically, based on the weighted reservoir sampling algorithm we propose a\nnovel parallel implementation of the node selection procedure, which is at the\nheart of the MMAS and other ACO algorithms. We also present a memory-efficient\nimplementation of another key-component -- the tabu list structure -- which is\nused in the ACO's solution construction stage. The proposed implementations,\ncombined with the existing approaches, lead to a total of six MMAS variants,\nwhich are evaluated on a set of Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) instances\nranging from 198 to 3,795 cities. The results show that our MMAS implementation\nis competitive with state-of-the-art GPU-based and multi-core CPU-based\nparallel ACO implementations: in fact, the times obtained for the Nvidia V100\nVolta GPU were up to 7.18x and 21.79x smaller, respectively. The fastest of the\nproposed MMAS variants is able to generate over 1 million candidate solutions\nper second when solving a 1,002-city instance. Moreover, we show that, combined\nwith the 2-opt local search heuristic, the proposed parallel MMAS finds\nhigh-quality solutions for the TSP instances with up to 18,512 nodes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 18 Jan 2020 14:18:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-27"}
