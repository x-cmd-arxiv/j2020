The shedding process is initiated either by the motion of a\nliquid re-entrant jet or a condensation shock. Cloud cavitation in nozzles\ninteracts with the flow field in the nozzle, the mass flow and the spray\nbreak-up, and causes erosion damage. For nozzle geometries cloud shedding and\nthe associated processes have not yet been studied in detail. In this paper, we\ninvestigate the process of cloud cavitation shedding, the re-entrant jet and\ncondensation shocks in a scaled-up generic step nozzle with injection into gas\nusing implicit Large-Eddy Simulations (LES). For modeling of the cavitating\nliquid we employ a barotropic equilibrium cavitation model, embedded in a\nhomogeneous multi-component mixture model. Full compressibility of all\ncomponents is taken into account to resolve the effects of collapsing vapor\nstructures. We carry out simulations of two operating points exhibiting\ndifferent cavitation regimes. The time-resolved, three-dimensional simulation\nresults cover several shedding cycles and provide deeper insight into the flow\nfield. Our results show that at lower cavitation numbers, shedding is initiated\nby condensation shocks, which has not yet been reported for nozzle flows with a\nconstant cross-section. We analyze the cavitation dynamics and the shedding\ncycles of both operating points.

While covert communication in a basic, vanilla setting where all\nvariables are known to Willie, results in the well-known square-root law, when\na jammer is present and assists Alice by creating uncertainty in Willie's\ndecoder, a strictly positive transmission rate is possible.\n  In this work, we analyze the case where the jammer is equipped with multiple\nantennas. Specifically, we analyze the effect of multiple antennas at the\njammer on Alice's transmission power and consequently on the transmission rate.\nWe consider both cases, one in which the channel knowledge is known and one in\nwhich it is unknown by the jammer. We formulate several optimization problems\nfor the transmission strategies of the jammer, to maximize his assistance to\nAlice, in terms of maximizing a ratio between Willie's and Bob's noise\nvariances.\n  When the channel information is known to the jammer, we show that the optimal\nstrategy of the jammer is to perform beamforming towards a single direction\nwith all his available power. This direction though, is not trivial, since it\nreflects an optimal tradeoff point between minimizing the interference at Bob\nand maximizing the interference at Willie. When the channel knowledge is\nunknown, we show that the optimal strategy of the jammer is either to transmit\nisotropically to all directions or to the null-space of Bob, where this choice\ndepends on certain channel conditions. This is in contrast to current schemes\nin the literature.

In this paper we\nanswer this affirmatively: (i) For general graphs, we show the existence of a\nkernel of size $\\mathcal{O}(k^2)$, (ii) For planar graphs, we improve this\nfurther by giving a kernel of size $\\mathcal{O}(k)$. In addition, we also show\nthat finding a tracking set of size at most $n-k$ for a graph on $n$ vertices\nis hard for the parameterized complexity class W[1], when parameterized by $k$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jan 2020 18:49:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Aug 2020 12:14:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-24"}

A set of nodes,\njointly aim to minimize a global objective function, which is the sum of local\nconvex functions. The objective and constraint functions are revealed locally\nto the nodes, at each time, after taking an action. Naturally, the constraints\ncannot be instantaneously satisfied. Therefore, we reformulate the problem to\nsatisfy these constraints in the long term. To this end, we propose a\ndistributed primal-dual mirror descent based approach, in which the primal and\ndual updates are carried out locally at all the nodes. This is followed by\nsharing and mixing of the primal variables by the local nodes via communication\nwith the immediate neighbors. To quantify the performance of the proposed\nalgorithm, we utilize the challenging, but more realistic metrics of dynamic\nregret and fit. Dynamic regret measures the cumulative loss incurred by the\nalgorithm, compared to the best dynamic strategy. On the other hand, fit\nmeasures the long term cumulative constraint violations. Without assuming the\nrestrictive Slater's conditions, we show that the proposed algorithm achieves\nsublinear regret and fit under mild, commonly used assumptions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jan 2020 18:53:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 May 2021 17:49:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-06"}

Attenuation curves result from a combination of dust grain\nproperties, dust content, and the spatial arrangement of dust and different\npopulations of stars. In this review we assess the current state of the field,\npaying particular attention to the importance of extinction curves as the\nbuilding blocks of attenuation laws. We introduce a quantitative framework to\ncharacterize and compare extinction and attenuation curves, present a\ntheoretical foundation for interpreting empirical results, overview an array of\nobservational methods, and review the observational state of the field at both\nlow and high redshift. Our main conclusions are: Attenuation curves exhibit a\nlarge range of slopes, from curves with shallow (Milky Way-like) slopes to\nthose exceeding the slope of the SMC extinction curve. The slopes of the curves\ncorrelate strongly with the effective optical opacities, in the sense that\ngalaxies with low dust column density (lower visual attenuation) tend to have\nsteeper slopes, whereas the galaxies with high dust column density have\nshallower (grey) slopes. Galaxies appear to exhibit a diverse range of 2175A UV\nbump strengths, but on average have suppressed bumps compared to the average\nMilky Way extinction curve. Theoretical studies indicate that variations in\nbump strength may result from similar geometric and radiative transfer effects\nthat drive the correlation between the slope and the dust column.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jan 2020 19:00:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-11"}

In particular, we review the mathematical theory underlying the three\ndifferent continuum models and highlight the different trade-offs of using\nthese models.\n  Next, we consider the numerical simulation of these models with a survey of\nvarious methods, with a focus on the Ericksen model. We then show how\ntechniques from the Ericksen model can be combined with the Landau-deGennes\nmodel to yield a $\\mathbf{Q}$-tensor model that exactly enforces uniaxiality,\nwhich is relevant for modeling many nematic LC systems. This is followed by an\nin-depth numerical analysis, using tools from $\\Gamma$-convergence, to justify\nour discrete method. We also show several numerical experiments and comparisons\nwith the standard Landau-deGennes model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jan 2020 19:35:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-13"}

The network perspective has also been widely applied to explore\nvarious complex systems in great depth. In the first decade, fundamental\ncharacteristics of complex network structure, such as the small-worldness,\nscale-freeness, and modularity, of various complex networked systems were\nharvested from analyzing big empirical data. The associated dynamical processes\non complex networks were also heavily studied. In the second decade, more\nattention was devoted to investigating the control of complex networked\nsystems, ranging from fundamental theories to practical applications. Here we\nbriefly review recent progress regarding network dynamics and control, mainly\nconcentrating on research questions proposed in the six papers we collected for\nthe topical issue entitled \"Network Dynamics and Control\" at\n$Advances~in~Complex~Systems$. This review closes with possible research\ndirections along this line, and several important problems to be solved.

A number of serial CTI effects have\nbeen identified during preliminary testing of CCDs developed by Imaging\nTechnology Laboratory (ITL) for use in the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope\n(LSST) camera focal plane that motivate additional study beyond the traditional\nCTI characterization. This study describes a more detailed examination of the\nserial deferred charge effects in order to fully characterize the deferred\ncharge measured in the serial overscan pixels of these sensors. The results\nindicate that in addition to proportional CTI loss that occurs at each pixel\ntransfer, ITL CCDs have additional contributions to the deferred charge\nmeasured in serial overscan pixels, likely caused by fixed CTI loss due to\ncharge trapping, and an electronic offset drift at high signal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jan 2020 21:07:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-13"}

In the\nformer case it is widely believed that in all cases the bound portion of the\ndebris quickly \"circularizes\" due to relativistic apsidal precession, i.e.,\nforms a compact accretion disk, and emits a flare of standardized lightcurve\nand spectrum. We show here that TDEs are more diverse and can be grouped into\nseveral distinct categories on the basis of stellar pericenter distance $r_p$;\nwe calculate the relative frequency of these categories. In particular, because\nrapid circularization requires $r_p \\lesssim 10r_g$ ($r_g \\equiv GM_{\\rm\nBH}/c^2$), it can happen in only a minority of total disruptions, $\\lesssim\n1/4$ when the black hole has mass $M_{\\rm BH} = 10^6 M_\\odot$. For larger\npericenter distances, $10 < r_p/r_g < 27$ (for $M_{\\rm BH}=10^6M_\\odot$), main\nsequence stars are completely disrupted, but the bound debris orbits are highly\neccentric and possess semimajor axes $\\sim 100\\times$ the scale of the expected\ncompact disk. Partial disruptions with fractional mass-loss $\\gtrsim 10\\%$\nshould occur with a rate similar to that of total disruptions; for fractional\nmass-loss $\\gtrsim 50\\%$, the rate is $\\approx 1/3$ as large.

Tuning the qubit into the\nspectral vicinity of the passband of this waveguide, we find non-exponential\nenergy relaxation as well as substantial changes to the qubit emission rate.\nFurther, upon addition of a reflective boundary to one end of the waveguide, we\nobserve revivals in the qubit population on a timescale 30 times longer than\nthe inverse of the qubit's emission rate, corresponding to the round-trip\ntravel time of an emitted photon. By tuning of the qubit-waveguide interaction\nstrength, we probe a crossover between Markovian and non-Markovian qubit\nemission dynamics. These attributes allow for future studies of multi-qubit\ncircuits coupled to structured reservoirs, in addition to constituting the\nnecessary resources for generation of multiphoton highly entangled states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jan 2020 22:05:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-13"}

URB is central in the design and implementation of\nfault-tolerant distributed systems, as many non-trivial fault-tolerant\ndistributed applications require communication with provable guarantees on\nmessage deliveries. Our study focuses on fault-tolerant implementations for\ntime-free message-passing systems that are prone to node-failures. Moreover, we\naim at the design of an even more robust communication abstraction. We do so\nthrough the lenses of self-stabilization---a very strong notion of\nfault-tolerance. In addition to node and communication failures,\nself-stabilizing algorithms can recover after the occurrence of arbitrary\ntransient faults; these faults represent any violation of the assumptions\naccording to which the system was designed to operate (as long as the algorithm\ncode stays intact).\n  This work proposes the first self-stabilizing URB solution for time-free\nmessage-passing systems that are prone to node-failures. The proposed algorithm\nhas an O(bufferUnitSize) stabilization time (in terms of asynchronous cycles)\nfrom arbitrary transient faults, where bufferUnitSize is a predefined constant\nthat can be set according to the available memory. Moreover, the communication\ncosts of our algorithm are similar to the ones of the non-self-stabilizing\nstate-of-the-art. The main differences are that our proposal considers repeated\ngossiping of O(1) bits messages and deals with bounded space (which is a\nprerequisite for self-stabilization). Specifically, each node needs to store up\nto bufferUnitSize n records and each record is of size O(v + n log n) bits,\nwhere n is the number of nodes in the system and v is the number of bits needed\nto encode a single URB instance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jan 2020 22:11:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-13"}

When multiple users transmit packets simultaneously in a\nslot, owing to the SIC technique, the AP is able to decode them through SIC\nresolve procedures (SRPs), which may occupy multiple consequent slots. While\nsuch an SRP could potentially improve the system throughput, how to fully\nexploit this capability in practical systems is still questionable. In\nparticular, the number of active users contending for the channel varies over\ntime which complicates the algorithm design. By fully exploiting the potential\nof SIC, the proposed algorithm is designed to maximize the system throughput\nand minimize the access delay. For this purpose, an online estimation is\nintroduced to estimate the number of active users in real-time and controls\ntheir transmissions accordingly. It is shown that the throughput of the\nproposed algorithm can reach up to 0.693 packets/slot under practical\nassumptions, which is the first result achieving the throughput limit proved by\nYu-Giannakis.

With many\nrandom effects, we consider new estimation method and penalized objective to\ncircumvent high-dimension integrals for marginal likelihood approximation. We\nestablish consistency and optimality of our method with endogenous app usage.\nWe apply our method to develop personalized push (\"prompt\") schedules in 294\napp users, with a goal to maximize the prompt response rate given past app\nusage and other contextual factors. We found the best push schedule given the\nsame covariates varied among the users, thus calling for personalized policies.\nUsing the estimated personalized policies would have achieved a mean prompt\nresponse rate of 23% in these users at 16 weeks or later: this is a remarkable\nimprovement on the observed rate (11%), while the literature suggests 3%-15%\nuser engagement at 3 months after download.

Most of the literature about linearizations assumes that\n$P(\\lambda)$ is expressed in the monomial basis but, because of the polynomial\napproximation techniques, in this context, $P(\\lambda)$ is expressed in a\nnon-monomial basis. The bases used with most frequency are the Chebyshev basis,\nthe Newton basis and the Lagrange basis. In this paper we construct a family of\nlinearizations of $P(\\lambda)$ that is easy to construct from the matrix\ncoefficients of $P(\\lambda)$ when this polynomial is expressed in any of those\nthree bases.

We cast\ncontextualized code search as a learning problem, where the goal is to learn a\ndistribution function computing the likelihood that each database code\ncompletes the program, and propose a neural model for predicting which database\ncode is likely to be most useful. Because it will be prohibitively expensive to\napply a neural model to each code in a database of millions or billions of\ncodes at search time, one of our key technical concerns is ensuring a speedy\nsearch.

If the\nconductors are electroplated, then the seed layer forms at least one edge, so\ncare must be taken to insure the electrical quality of these layers. In this\nwork, we study the initial quality of SAM-based seed layers that are compatible\nwith complex surfaces including through-silicon vias (TSVs), as are used in\nvia-last three-dimensional semiconductor device packaging. The conformal and\nelectrical quality of the seed metal is very important. Also important for a\nmultifunction seed layer is its ability as a barrier layer, which protects the\nsubstrate from high temperature diffusion of the deposited metal. Thus, the\nbarrier layer must be robust enough to withstand diffusion, yet thin enough to\nprovide a conformal surface that allows metal seed layer deposition. Standard\nbarrier layer deposition methods such as evaporation or sputtering require\neither a line of sight from the source or aspect ratios large enough to provide\nscattering from the background gas within the structure to coat all surfaces.\nElectrochemical and chemical vapor deposition provide alternatives, but\nconcerns arise about contamination and compatibility with radio frequency or\nhigh-speed digital signals. We propose a barrier layer based on an aromatic\nself-assembled monolayer (SAM) for use in electroless copper seed layer\ndeposition.

One common network operation will be the aggregation of\ndistributed data (such as sensor observations or AI-model updates) for\nfunctional computation (e.g., averaging) so as to support large-scale sensing\nand distributed machine learning. An efficient solution for data aggregation,\ncalled \"over-the-air computation\" (AirComp), embeds functional computation into\nsimultaneous access by many edge devices. Such schemes exploit the waveform\nsuperposition of a multi-access channel to allow an access point to receive a\ndesired function of simultaneous signals. In this work, we aim at realizing\nAirComp in a two-cell multi-antenna system. To this end, a novel scheme of\nsimultaneous signal-and-interference alignment (SIA) is proposed that builds on\nclassic IA to manage interference for multi-cell AirComp. The principle of SIA\nis to divide the spatial channel space into two subspaces with equal\ndimensions: one for signal alignment required by AirComp and the other for\ninter-cell IA. As a result, the number of interference-free spatially\nmultiplexed functional streams received by each AP is maximized (equal to half\nof the available spatial degrees-of-freedom). Furthermore, the number is\nindependent of the population of devices in each cell. In addition, the\nextension to SIA for more than two cells is discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jan 2020 05:08:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-13"}

It\nis time-consuming and laborious. Furthermore, a misclassified red blood cell\nmorphology will lead to false disease diagnosis and improper treatment. Thus, a\ndecent pathologist must truly be an expert in classifying red blood cell\nmorphology. In the past decade, many approaches have been proposed for\nclassifying human red blood cell morphology. However, those approaches have not\naddressed the class imbalance problem in classification. A class imbalance\nproblem---a problem where the numbers of samples in classes are very\ndifferent---is one of the problems that can lead to a biased model towards the\nmajority class. Due to the rarity of every type of abnormal blood cell\nmorphology, the data from the collection process are usually imbalanced. In\nthis study, we aimed to solve this problem specifically for classification of\ndog red blood cell morphology by using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)---a\nwell-known deep learning technique---in conjunction with a focal loss function,\nadept at handling class imbalance problem. The proposed technique was conducted\non a well-designed framework: two different CNNs were used to verify the\neffectiveness of the focal loss function and the optimal hyper-parameters were\ndetermined by 5-fold cross-validation. The experimental results show that both\nCNNs models augmented with the focal loss function achieved higher\n$F_{1}$-scores, compared to the models augmented with a conventional\ncross-entropy loss function that does not address class imbalance problem. In\nother words, the focal loss function truly enabled the CNNs models to be less\nbiased towards the majority class than the cross-entropy did in the\nclassification task of imbalanced dog red blood cell data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jan 2020 07:31:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-18"}

More specifically, we train six different machine learning\nalgorithms (i.e., Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine,\nDecision Trees, Random Forest, and Neural Network) with a dataset comprising\nover two million refactorings from 11,149 real-world projects from the Apache,\nF-Droid, and GitHub ecosystems. The resulting models predict 20 different\nrefactorings at class, method, and variable-levels with an accuracy often\nhigher than 90%. Our results show that (i) Random Forests are the best models\nfor predicting software refactoring, (ii) process and ownership metrics seem to\nplay a crucial role in the creation of better models, and (iii) models\ngeneralize well in different contexts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jan 2020 08:18:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Sep 2020 09:37:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 11 Sep 2020 12:38:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-14"}

To address this problem, we\ncollect the first VQA 360 dataset, containing around 17,000 real-world\nimage-question-answer triplets for a variety of question types.

This increasingly rapid transformation, especially in\ndomains like IoT or Cloud computing, poses significant challenges to guarantee\nhigh quality software, since dynamism and agile short-term planning reduce the\nability to detect and manage risks.

In this paper, we proposed a deep interactive\nreinforcement learning method for path following of AUV by combining the\nadvantages of deep reinforcement learning and interactive RL. In addition,\nsince the human trainer cannot provide human rewards for AUV when it is running\nin the ocean and AUV needs to adapt to a changing environment, we further\npropose a deep reinforcement learning method that learns from both human\nrewards and environmental rewards at the same time.

Our experimental results show that with our\nproposed deep interactive RL method, AUV can converge faster than a DQN learner\nfrom only environmental reward. Moreover, AUV learning with our deep RL from\nboth human and environmental rewards can also achieve a similar or even better\nperformance than that with the deep interactive RL method and can adapt to the\nactual environment by further learning from environmental rewards.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jan 2020 09:22:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-13"}

Furthermore, the high data-rates\ndo not allow for permanent storage of observations at high resolution. Offline\nRFI mitigation is therefore not possible anymore.

Similarly, a phase\nbattery is a quantum equipment which provides a persistent phase bias to the\nwave function of a quantum circuit. It represents a key element for quantum\ntechnologies based on quantum coherence. Unlike the voltage batteries, a phase\nbattery has not been implemented so far, mainly because of the natural rigidity\nof the quantum phase that, in typical quantum circuits, is imposed by the\nparity and time-reversal symmetry constrains. Here we report on the first\nexperimental realization of a phase battery in a hybrid superconducting\ncircuit. It consists of an n-doped InAs nanowire with unpaired-spin surface\nstates and proximitized by Al superconducting leads. We find that the\nferromagnetic polarization of the unpaired-spin states is efficiently converted\ninto a persistent phase bias $\\varphi_0$ across the wire, leading to the\nanomalous Josephson effect. By applying an external in-plane magnetic field a\ncontinuous tuning of $\\varphi_0$ is achieved. This allows the charging and\ndischarging of the quantum phase battery and reveals the symmetries of the\nanomalous Josephson effect predicted by our theoretical model.

After all, a single hospital may conduct\nthousands of distinct activities and generate millions of events per year. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel trace clustering approach by using sample sets\nof patients provided by medical experts.

Furthermore, we use the obtained BI parameter\nto numerically compute the entropy of isolated horizons with areas ranging up\nto $250\\,l_P^2$, by counting the number of micro-states associated to a given\narea. The resulting entropy has a leading term ${\\cal S} \\approx 0.25\\, {\\cal\nA}$, in agreement to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. As the identification of\nthe above eigenstate rests on the matching between classical areas and quantum\narea eigenvalues, we also present, on the basis of an effective quantum model\nfor the Schwarzschild black hole recently proposed by Ashtekar, Olmedo and\nSingh, an expression for the quantum corrected area of isolated horizons, valid\nfor any black hole mass. Quantum corrections are shown to be negligible for a\nPlanck mass black hole, of order $10^{-3}$ relative to the classical area.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jan 2020 13:45:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Mar 2020 15:06:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 7 Jul 2020 14:37:26 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 29 Nov 2020 15:00:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-01"}

For the optimisation, we use a\nquasi-Newton limited-memory BFGS algorithm combined with an adjoint approach\nfor the gradient. We also consider reconstruction based on a Taylor's frozen\nturbulence (TFT) model as point of comparison. To evaluate the approach, we\nconstruct a series of virtual lidar measurements from a fine-grid LES of a\npressure-driven boundary-layer. The reconstruction uses LES on a coarser mesh\nand smaller domain, and results are compared to the fine-grid reference. Two\nlidar scanning modes are considered: a classical plan-position-indicator mode,\nwhich swipes the lidar beam in a horizontal plane, and a 3D pattern that is\nbased on a Lissajous curve. We find that normalised errors lie between 15% and\n25% (error variance normalised by background variance) in the scanning region,\nand increase to $100\\%$ over a distance that is comparable to the correlation\nlength scale outside this scanning region. Moreover, LES outperforms TFT by 30%\nto 70% depending on scanning mode and location.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jan 2020 14:28:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-17"}

Globular clusters are\nideal targets for transient searches because of their high stellar densities\nand large populations of variable systems. Using all archival observations of\n47 Tuc obtained with the UV/optical telescope (UVOT) aboard the Neil Gehrels\nSwift observatory with the uvm2 filter, we searched for UV variability using a\nspecialised pipeline which utilises difference image analysis.

We thus increase the known number of DNe in 47 Tuc to 5\nand the total number of detected DNe in all Galactic GCs combined from 14 to\n17.

A common strategy is to reconstruct a preliminary image as the\ninput of a neural network to achieve an optimized image. Usually, the\npreliminary image is acquired with the prior knowledge of the imaging model.\nOne outstanding challenge, however, is the degree to which the actual imaging\nmodel deviates from the assumed model. Model mismatches degrade the quality of\nthe preliminary image and therefore affect the DL predictions. Another main\nchallenge is that since most imaging inverse problems are ill-posed and the\nnetworks are over-parameterized, DL networks have flexibility to extract\nfeatures from the data that are not directly related to the imaging model. To\nsolve these challenges, a two-step-training DL (TST-DL) framework is proposed\nfor real-time computational imaging without physics priors. First, a single\nfully-connected layer (FCL) is trained to directly learn the model. Then, this\nFCL is fixed and concatenated with an un-trained U-Net architecture for a\nsecond-step training to improve the output image fidelity, resulting in four\nmain advantages. First, it does not rely on an accurate representation of the\nimaging model since the model is directly learned. Second, real-time imaging\ncan be achieved. Third, the TST-DL network is trained in the desired direction\nand the predictions are improved since the first step is constrained to learn\nthe model and the second step improves the result by learning the optimal\nregularizer. Fourth, the approach accommodates any size and dimensionality of\ndata. We demonstrate this framework using a linear single-pixel camera imaging\nmodel. The results are quantitatively compared with those from other DL\nframeworks and model-based iterative optimization approaches. We further extend\nthis concept to nonlinear models in the application of image\nde-autocorrelation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jan 2020 15:05:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 17 May 2020 15:11:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 18 Aug 2020 13:57:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-12"}

Moreover, our methods\nallow to improve the understanding of quantum correlations by delivering novel\ncriteria for quantum steering and improved ways to construct local hidden\nvariable models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jan 2020 15:30:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Dec 2020 22:20:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-14"}

However, such models can lead to myopic and\ncontradictory behaviour. Previous works in the literature have suggested using\nconjectural variations to overcome this modelling issue. We first show however,\nthat an oligopoly with competitive fringe where all firms have investment\ndecisions, will also lead to myopic and contradictory behaviour when modelled\nusing conjectural variations. Consequently, we develop an Equilibrium Problem\nwith Equilibrium Constraints (EPEC) to model such an electricity market\nstructure. The EPEC models two types of players: price-making firms, who have\nmarket power, and price-taking firms, who do not. In addition to generation\ndecisions, all firms have endogenous investment decisions for multiple new\ngenerating technologies. The results indicate that, when modelling an oligopoly\nwith a competitive fringe and generation investment decisions, an EPEC model\ncan represent a more realistic market structure and overcome the myopic\nbehaviour observed in MCPs. The EPEC considered found multiple equilibria for\ninvestment decisions and firms' profits. However, market prices and consumer\ncosts were found to remain relatively constant across the equilibria. In\naddition, the model shows how it may be optimal for price-making firms to\noccasionally sell some of their electricity below marginal cost in order to\nde-incentivize price-taking firms from investing further into the market. Such\nstrategic behaviour would not be captured by MCP or cost-minimisation models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jan 2020 15:59:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-13"}

Transition functions\noften rely on parameterized conditions to model preconditions for the\ncontrollers, where the correct values of the parameters depend on factors\nrelating to the environment or the specific robot. In the absence of specific\ncalibration procedures a roboticist must painstakingly adjust the parameters\nthrough a series of trial and error experiments. In this process, identifying\nwhen the robot has taken an incorrect action, and what should be done is\nstraightforward, but finding the right parameter values can be difficult. We\npresent an alternative approach that we call, interactive SMT-based Robot\nTransition Repair. During execution we record an execution trace of the\ntransition function, and we ask the roboticist to identify a few instances\nwhere the robot has transitioned incorrectly, and what the correct transition\nshould have been. A user supplies these corrections based on the type of error\nto repair, and an automated analysis of the traces partially evaluates the\ntransition function for each correction. This system of constraints is then\nformulated as a MaxSMT problem, where the solution is a minimal adjustment to\nthe parameters that satisfies the maximum number of constraints. In order to\nidentify a repair that accurately captures user intentions and generalizes to\nnovel scenarios, solutions are explored by iteratively adding constraints to\nthe MaxSMT problem to yield sets of alternative repairs. We test with state\nmachines from multiple domains including robot soccer and autonomous driving,\nand we evaluate solver based repair with respect to solver choice and\noptimization hyperparameters. Our results demonstrate that SRTR can repair a\nvariety of states machines and error types 1) quickly, 2) with small numbers of\ncorrections, while 3) not overcorrecting state machines and harming generalized\nperformance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jan 2020 23:14:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-14"}

Our main insight is that we can improve precision by (i) first\nextracting intent (structured information) from the query for the above query\nclasses and (ii) then performing structure-aware matching (instead of just\ntextual matching) between the extracted intent and the candidates to select the\nanswer. We model (i) as a sequence tagging task. We leverage state-of-the-art\ndeep neural network models with word embeddings. The model requires large scale\ntraining data which is expensive to obtain via manual labeling; we therefore\ndevelop a novel method to automatically generate the training data. For (ii),\nwe develop novel features to compute structure-aware match and train a machine\nlearning model. Our experiments on real-life web search queries show that (i)\nour intent extractor for list and superlative intent queries has significantly\nhigher precision and coverage compared with baseline approaches and (ii) our\ntable answer selector significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline\napproach. This technology has been used in production by Microsoft's Bing\nsearch engine since 2016.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 10 Jan 2020 01:43:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-15"}
