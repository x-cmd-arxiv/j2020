We\nobtained the deflection angles for the Bardeen spacetime to the eleventh order\nof $m/b$ where $m$ is the ADM mass and $b$ is the impact parameter, and for the\nHayward, Janis-Newman-Winicour and Einstein-Born-Infeld spacetimes to the\nninth, seventh and eleventh order respectively.

Moreover, it is shown\nthat although these deflection angles are calculated in the large $b/m$ limit,\ntheir minimal valid $b$ can be as small as a few $m$'s as long as the order is\nhigh enough.

Firstly, how can we make the learning models more\nflexible and efficient, so that agents can learn quickly with fewer examples?\nInspired by how physicists model the world, we introduce a paradigm and an AI\nPhysicist agent for simultaneously learning many small specialized models\n(theories) and the domain they are accurate, which can then be simplified,\nunified and stored, facilitating few-shot learning in a continual way.\nSecondly, for representation learning, when can we learn a good representation,\nand how does learning depend on the structure of the dataset? We approach this\nquestion by studying phase transitions when tuning the tradeoff hyperparameter.\nIn the information bottleneck, we theoretically show that these phase\ntransitions are predictable and reveal structure in the relationships between\nthe data, the model, the learned representation and the loss landscape.\nThirdly, how can agents discover causality from observations?

However, the sensitivity of the Gaussian attitude filter to the\nmeasurement noise prompted the introduction of the nonlinear attitude filters\nwhich account for the nonlinear nature of the attitude dynamics problem and\nallow for a simpler filter derivation. This paper presents a survey of several\ntypes of attitude determination and estimation algorithms. Each category is\ndetailed and illustrated with literature examples in both continuous and\ndiscrete form. A comparison between these algorithms is demonstrated in terms\nof transient and steady-state error through simulation results. The comparison\nis supplemented by statistical analysis of the error-related mean, infinity\nnorm, and standard deviation of each algorithm in the steady-state.

It has been argued that this so-called \"wind driven relaxation\ncycle\" might explain the observed variability in some disk accreting objects.\nHere, we study the response of the innermost mass accretion rate $\\dot{M}_a$ to\nthe loss of matter at different rates and radii. We allow the wind launching\nradius, $R_L$, to scale with $\\dot{M}_a$. We computed a grid of time-dependent\nmodels for various $\\dot{M}_w$-$\\dot{M}_a$ and $R_{L}$-$\\dot{M}_a$\ndependencies. We find that the disk behaviour significantly differs for the\n'variable $R_L$' case compared to the 'fixed $R_L$' case. In particular, much\nstronger winds are required to destabilize the disk in the former than the\nlatter case. However, the $\\dot{M}_a$ amplitude does not grow significantly\neven for unstable cases because the oscillations saturate at a low level either\ndue to disk depletion or due to the wind being launched at very small radii, or\nboth. This result implies that disk winds are unlikely to be responsible for\nstate transitions as those require large changes in the inner disk. Despite\nmodest changes at the inner disk regions, the disk surface density at large\nradii can vary with a large amplitude, i.e., from 0 to a few factors of the\nsteady state value.

Since its inception by\nGrundy in 1939, Grundy Coloring has been examined for its structural and\nalgorithmic aspects. A brute-force $f(k)n^{2^{k-1}}$-time algorithm for Grundy\nColoring on general graphs is not difficult to obtain, where $k$ is the number\nof colors required by the most adversarial vertex ordering. It was asked\nseveral times whether the dependency on $k$ in the exponent of $n$ can be\navoided or reduced, and its answer seemed elusive until now. We prove that\nGrundy Coloring is W[1]-hard and the brute-force algorithm is essentially\noptimal under the Exponential Time Hypothesis, thus settling this question by\nthe negative.\n  The key ingredient in our W[1]-hardness proof is to use so-called half-graphs\nas a building block to transmit a color from one vertex to another. Leveraging\nthe half-graphs, we also prove that b-Chromatic Core is W[1]-hard, whose\nparameterized complexity was posed as an open question by Panolan et al. [JCSS\n'17]. A natural follow-up question is, how the parameterized complexity changes\nin the absence of (large) half-graphs.

As noise accumulates in the stored\nweights, the NeuralNet's performance will degrade. This paper studies how to\nuse error correcting codes (ECCs) to protect the weights. Different from\nclassic error correction in data storage, the optimization objective is to\noptimize the NeuralNet's performance after error correction, instead of\nminimizing the Uncorrectable Bit Error Rate in the protected bits. That is, by\nseeing the NeuralNet as a function of its input, the error correction scheme is\nfunction-oriented. A main challenge is that a deep NeuralNet often has millions\nto hundreds of millions of weights, causing a large redundancy overhead for\nECCs, and the relationship between the weights and its NeuralNet's performance\ncan be highly complex. To address the challenge, we propose a Selective\nProtection (SP) scheme, which chooses only a subset of important bits for ECC\nprotection.

However, these effects usually suffer\nfrom extremely weak nature and require high input intensity values in order to\nbe excited. Interestingly, the large third order nonlinearity of graphene,\nalong with the strong field confinement stemming from its plasmonic behavior,\ncan be utilized to enhance several relative weak nonlinear effects at infrared\n(IR) and terahertz (THz) frequencies. Towards this goal, various nonlinear\ngraphene metasurfaces are presented in this work to effectively increase the\nefficiency of different optical nonlinear effects and, as a result, decrease\nthe required input intensity needed to be excited. In particular, we will show\nthat the efficiency of four-wave mixing (FWM) can be improved by several orders\nof magnitude by using a nonlinear metasurface composed of patterned graphene\nribbons, a dielectric interlayer, and a metallic reflector acting as substrate.\nWe also demonstrate that the self-phase modulation (SPM) nonlinear process can\nbe enhanced by using an alternative graphene nonlinear metasurface, operating\nas coherent perfect absorber, leading to a pronounced shift in the resonant\nfrequency of the coherent perfect absorption (CPA) effect of this structure as\nthe input intensity of the impinging incident waves is increased. This property\nwill provide a robust mechanism to dynamically tune and switch the CPA process.\nFurthermore, it will be presented that strong negative reflection and\nrefraction can be achieved by a single graphene monolayer film due to the\nenhancement of another nonlinear process, known as phase conjugation. This\nnonlinear process is envisioned to be used in the construction of a perfect\nimaging device with subwavelength resolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Jan 2020 02:02:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-29"}

While the evaluation of such\ncompressibility parameters is well-studied for continuous and discrete\nmeasures, the case of discrete-continuous measures is quite subtle. In this\npaper, we focus on a class of multi-dimensional random measures that have\nsingularities on affine lower-dimensional subsets. This class of distributions\nnaturally arises when considering linear transformation of component-wise\nindependent discrete-continuous random variables. To measure the\ncompressibility of such distributions, we introduce the new notion of\ndimensional-rate bias (DRB) which is closely related to the entropy and\ndifferential entropy in discrete and continuous cases, respectively. Similar to\nentropy and differential entropy, DRB is useful in evaluating the mutual\ninformation between distributions of the aforementioned type. Besides the DRB,\nwe also evaluate the the RID of these distributions. We further provide an\nupper-bound for the RID of multi-dimensional random measures that are obtained\nby Lipschitz functions of component-wise independent discrete-continuous random\nvariables ($\\mathbf{X}$).

Instead of regarding the segmentation task independently, we\nintroduce a foreground network to detect melanoma lesions and a background\nnetwork to mask non-melanoma regions.

Depending on the specification,\noptimal strategies might be simple or quite complex, for example having to use\n(possibly infinite) memory. Hence, research strives to understand which\nsettings allow for simple strategies.\n  In 2005, Gimbert and Zielonka provided a complete characterization of\npreference relations (a formal framework to model specifications and game\nobjectives) that admit memoryless optimal strategies for both players. In the\nlast fifteen years however, practical applications have driven the community\ntoward games with complex or multiple objectives, where memory -- finite or\ninfinite -- is almost always required. Despite much effort, the exact frontiers\nof the class of preference relations that admit finite-memory optimal\nstrategies still elude us.\n  In this work, we establish a complete characterization of preference\nrelations that admit optimal strategies using arena-independent finite memory,\ngeneralizing the work of Gimbert and Zielonka to the finite-memory case. We\nalso prove an equivalent to their celebrated corollary of great practical\ninterest: if both players have optimal (arena-independent-)finite-memory\nstrategies in all one-player games, then it is also the case in all two-player\ngames. Finally, we pinpoint the boundaries of our results with regard to the\nliterature: our work completely covers the case of arena-independent memory\n(e.g., multiple parity objectives, lower- and upper-bounded energy objectives),\nand paves the way to the arena-dependent case (e.g., multiple lower-bounded\nenergy objectives).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Jan 2020 09:27:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 May 2020 09:20:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 20 Jul 2020 06:43:28 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 6 Apr 2021 07:29:27 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 12 Nov 2021 10:23:51 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Fri, 14 Jan 2022 12:13:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-14"}

To\nthwart such behavior, \\emph{resource competitive analysis} is proposed. In this\nframework, sending, listening, or jamming on one channel for one time slot\ncosts one unit of energy. The adversary can employ arbitrary strategy to\ndisrupt communication, but has a limited energy budget $T$. The honest nodes,\non the other hand, aim to accomplish broadcast while spending only $o(T)$.\nPrevious work has shown, in a $C$-channels network containing $n$ nodes, for\nlarge $T$ values, each node can receive the message in $\\tilde{O}(T/C)$ time,\nwhile spending only $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{T/n})$ energy.

More specifically,\nin our algorithms, for large $T$ values, each node's runtime is $O(T/C)$, and\neach node's energy cost is $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{T/n})$. We also complement\nalgorithmic results with lower bounds, proving both the time complexity and the\nenergy complexity of our algorithms are optimal or near-optimal (within a\npoly-log factor). Our technical contributions lie in using \"epidemic broadcast\"\nto achieve time efficiency and resource competitiveness, and employing coupling\ntechniques in the analysis to handle the adaptivity of the adversary.

The\nphysics underlying the patterns is specific to the mechanisms, and is encoded\nby partial differential equations (PDEs). With the aim of discovering hidden\nphysics, we have previously presented a variational approach to identifying\nsuch systems of PDEs in the face of noisy data at varying fidelities (Computer\nMethods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering, 353:201-216, 2019). Here, we\nextend our variational system identification methods to address the challenges\npresented by image data on microstructures in materials physics. PDEs are\nformally posed as initial and boundary value problems over combinations of time\nintervals and spatial domains whose evolution is either fixed or can be\ntracked. However, the vast majority of microscopy techniques for evolving\nmicrostructure in a given material system deliver micrographs of pattern\nevolution over domains that bear no relation with each other at different time\ninstants. The temporal resolution can rarely capture the fastest time scales\nthat dominate the early dynamics, and noise abounds. Furthermore, data for\nevolution of the same phenomenon in a material system may well be obtained from\ndifferent physical specimens. Against this backdrop of spatially unrelated,\nsparse and multi-source data, we exploit the variational framework to make\njudicious choices of weighting functions and identify PDE operators from the\ndynamics. A consistency condition arises for parsimonious inference of a\nminimal set of the spatial operators at steady state. It is complemented by a\nconfirmation test that provides a sharp condition for acceptance of the\ninferred operators. The entire framework is demonstrated on synthetic data that\nreflect the characteristics of the experimental material microscopy images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 11 Jan 2020 18:19:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Apr 2020 16:22:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 10 Apr 2020 01:36:57 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 20:21:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-02"}

The non-intrusiveness of the proposed technique\nstems from formulating a novel Machine Learning (ML) based framework used with\nPOD. The features of ML model are designed such that they take into\nconsideration the temporal evolution of the state solutions and thereby\navoiding simulator access for time dependency of the solutions. We represent\nwell location changes as a parameter by introducing geometry-based features and\nflow diagnostics inspired physics-based features. An error correction model\nbased on reduced model solutions is formulated later to correct for\ndiscrepancies in the state solutions at well gridblocks. It was observed that\nthe global PMOR could predict the overall trend in pressure and saturation\nsolutions at the well blocks but some bias was observed that resulted in\ndiscrepancies in prediction of quantities of interest (QoI). Thus, the error\ncorrection model that considers the physics based reduced model solutions as\nfeatures, proved to reduce the error in QoI significantly.

Another problem is that labelling each frame is tedious and\ncostly, which usually prohibits the construction of large-scale datasets. To\nsolve these problems, we propose a weakly supervised hierarchical reinforcement\nlearning framework, which decomposes the whole task into several subtasks to\nenhance the summarization quality.

If no explicit explanations are provided\nby a system (e.g. by a self-explaining AI) or other sources (e.g. an\ninstructor), the mental model is typically formed based on experiences, i.e.\nthe observations of the user during the interaction.
