The CTRNN itself is trained by using an explicit\nRunge-Kutta solver to sample a number of solutions of Einstein's equations for\nthe Bianchi Type A models and then using a nonlinear least-squares approach to\nfind the optimal set of weights, time delay constants, and bias parameters that\nprovide the best fit of the CTRNN equations to the Einstein equations.

When a\nstanding whistler wave collapses due to the wave breaking of ion plasma waves,\nthe energy of the electromagnetic waves transfers directly to the ion kinetic\nenergy. Here we find that the ion heating by the standing whistler wave is\noperational even in multi-dimensional simulations of multi-ion species targets,\nsuch as deuterium-tritium (DT) ices and solid ammonia borane (H$_6$BN). The\nenergy conversion efficiency to ions becomes as high as 15% of the injected\nlaser energy, which depends significantly on the target thickness and laser\npulse duration. The ion temperature could reach a few tens of keV or much\nhigher if appropriate laser-plasma conditions are selected. DT fusion plasmas\ngenerated by this method must be useful as efficient neutron sources. Our\nnumerical simulations suggest that the neutron generation efficiency exceeds\n10$^9$ n/J per steradian, which is beyond the current achievements of the\nstate-of-the-art laser experiments.

Our\napproach is applied to state-scale maize yield and meteorological data for the\nUS Corn Belt from 1981 to 2014 as an exemplar, but would be readily\ntransferable to other crops, locations and spatial scales. Experimentation with\na number of models shows that maize growth rates can be characterised by a\ntwo-dimensional Gaussian function of temperature and precipitation with monthly\ncontributions accumulated over the growing period. This approach accounts for\nnon-linear growth responses to the individual meteorological variables, and\nallows for interactions between them. Our models correctly identify that\ntemperature and precipitation have the largest impact on yield in the six\nmonths prior to the harvest, in agreement with the typical growing season for\nUS maize (April to September). Maximal growth rates occur for monthly mean\ntemperature 18-19$^\\circ$C, corresponding to a daily maximum temperature of\n24-25$^\\circ$C (in broad agreement with previous work) and monthly total\nprecipitation 115 mm. Our approach also provides a self-consistent way of\ninvestigating climate change impacts on current US maize varieties in the\nabsence of adaptation measures. Keeping precipitation and growing area fixed, a\ntemperature increase of $2^\\circ$C, relative to 1981-2014, results in the mean\nyield decreasing by 8\\%, while the yield variance increases by a factor of\naround 3. We thus provide a flexible, data-driven framework for exploring the\nimpacts of natural climate variability and climate change on globally\nsignificant crops based on their observed behaviour.

This study investigates lexicon robustness to\nprogressive word failure with multiplex network attacks. The average lexicon of\nan adult English speaker is built by considering 16000 words connected through\nsemantic free associations and phonological sound similarities. Progressive\nstructural degradation is modelled as random and targeted attacks. Words with\nhigher psycholinguistic features (e.g. frequency, length, age of acquisition,\npolysemy) or network centrality (e.g. closeness, PageRank, betweenness and\ndegree) are targeted first. Aphasia-inspired attacks are introduced here and\ntarget first words named correctly, more or less frequently, by patients with\nanomic aphasia, a pathology disrupting word finding. Robustness is measured as\nconnectedness, fundamental for activation spreading and lexical retrieval, and\nviability, a multi-layer connectivity identifying language kernels. The lexicon\nis resilient to random, aphasia-inspired and psycholinguistic attacks.\nCatastrophic phase transitions happen when phonological and semantic degrees\nare combined, making the lexicon fragile to multidegree attacks. The viable\nkernel is fragile to multi-PageRank and to aphasia-inspired attacks.\nConsequently, connectedness in the lexicon is mediated by hubs, whereas\nviability enables a lexical semantic/phonological interplay and corresponds to\na facilitative naming effect in aphasia. These effects persist also through\nageing, in different network representations of younger and older lexicons.\nThis study indicates the need to prevent failure of high multidegree and viable\nwords in the mental lexicon when pursuing the design of effective language\nrestoration strategies against cognitive impairing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jan 2020 16:59:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}

To derive accurate host galaxy\nproperties, we create depth-optimised coadds using single-epoch DES-SN images\nthat are selected based on sky and atmospheric conditions. For each of the five\nDES-SN seasons, a separate coadd is made from the other 4 seasons such that\neach SN has a corresponding deep coadd with no contaminating SN emission. The\ncoadds reach limiting magnitudes of order $\\sim 27$ in $g$-band, and have a\nmuch smaller magnitude uncertainty than the previous DES-SN host templates,\nparticularly for faint objects.

In order to improve the robustness of machine\nlearning systems, Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) has been proposed\nas a generalization of Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM). However, its use in\ndeep learning has been severely restricted due to the relative inefficiency of\nthe optimizers available for DRO in comparison to the wide-spread variants of\nStochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizers for ERM. We propose SGD with\nhardness weighted sampling, a principled and efficient optimization method for\nDRO in machine learning that is particularly suited in the context of deep\nlearning. Similar to a hard example mining strategy in practice, the proposed\nalgorithm is straightforward to implement and computationally as efficient as\nSGD-based optimizers used for deep learning, requiring minimal overhead\ncomputation. In contrast to typical ad hoc hard mining approaches, we prove the\nconvergence of our DRO algorithm for over-parameterized deep learning networks\nwith ReLU activation and a finite number of layers and parameters. Our\nexperiments on fetal brain 3D MRI segmentation and brain tumor segmentation in\nMRI demonstrate the feasibility and the usefulness of our approach.

The device\noperates with a doped silicon radiator maintained at a temperature of 800 K.\nThe architecture of the photovoltaic cell, including the emitter and base\nthicknesses, the doping level of the base, and the front contact grid\nparameters, are optimized for maximizing NF-TPV power output. This is\naccomplished by solving radiation and charge transport in the cell via\nfluctuational electrodynamics and the minority charge carrier continuity\nequations, in addition to accounting for the shading losses due to the front\ncontacts and additional series resistance losses introduced by the front\ncontacts and the substrate. The results reveal that these additional loss\nmechanisms negatively affect NF-TPV performance in a non-negligible manner, and\nthat the maximum power output is a trade-off between shading losses and series\nresistance losses introduced by the front contacts. For instance, when the cell\nis optimized for a 1 x 1 mm2 device operating at a vacuum gap of 100 nm, the\nlosses introduced by the front contacts reduce the maximum power output by a\nfactor of ~ 2.5 compared to the idealized case when no front contact grid is\npresent.

XSR uses linear encoding\noperation to both 1)~build the path labels of unicast and multicast data\ntransfers; 2)~perform fast computational efficient routing decisions compared\nto standard table lookup procedure without any packet modification all along\nthe path. XSR specifically focuses on decreasing the complexity of forwarding\nrouter operations. This allows packet switches (e.g, link-layer switch or\nrouter) to perform only simple linear operations over a binary vector label\nwhich embeds the path. XSR provides the building blocks to speed up the\nforwarding plane and can be applied to different data planes such as MPLS or\nIPv6. Compared to recent approaches based on modular arithmetic, XSR computes\nthe smallest label possible and presents strong scalable properties allowing to\nbe deployed over any kind of core vendor or datacenter networks. At last but\nnot least, the same computed label can be used interchangeably to cross the\npath forward or reverse in the context of unicast communication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jan 2020 19:08:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-10"}

Colliding wind binaries are massive systems featuring strong,\ninteracting stellar winds which may act as particle accelerators. Therefore,\nsuch binaries are good candidates for detection at high energies. However, only\nthe massive binary Eta Carinae has been firmly associated with a gamma-ray\nsignal. A second system, gamma^2 Velorum, is positionally coincident with a\ngamma-ray source, but unambiguous identification remains lacking. Aims.\nObserving orbital modulation of the flux would establish an unambiguous\nidentification of the binary gamma^2 Velorum as the gamma-ray source detected\nby the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT). Methods. We have used more than\n10 years of observations with Fermi-LAT. Events are folded with the orbital\nperiod of the binary to search for variability. Systematic errors that might\narise from the strong emission of the nearby Vela pulsar are studied by\ncomparing with a more conservative pulse-gated analysis. Results. Hints of\norbital variability are found, indicating maximum flux from the binary during\napastron passage. Conclusions. Our analysis strengthens the possibility that\ngamma-rays are produced in gamma^2 Velorum, most likely as a result of particle\nacceleration in the wind collision region. The observed orbital variability is\nconsistent with predictions from recent MHD simulations, but contrasts with the\norbital variability from Eta Carinae, where the peak of the light curve is\nfound at periastron.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jan 2020 19:24:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Mar 2020 09:59:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-25"}

The cavity formed by the finite length of the waveguide allows for\nstrong absorption of incident infrared light (>80%) with Q factors in excess of\n90, including an epsilon near zero waveguide mode with\n{\\epsilon}eff=0.0574+0.008i. The localization of the electromagnetic fields\nwithin the gap between the grating teeth suggests an opportunity to realize a\nnew platform for studying vibrational coupling in liquid environments, with\npotential opportunities for enhanced spectroscopies. We show that these modes\nare supported in anhydrous and aqueous environments, and that high aspect ratio\ngratings coherently couple to the vibrational transition in the surrounding\nliquid.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jan 2020 20:08:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-09"}

Epidemic models of STIs are often used to characterize the\ncontribution of risk groups to overall transmission by projecting the\ntransmission population attributable fraction (tPAF) of unmet prevention and\ntreatment needs within risk groups. However, evidence suggests that STI risk is\ndynamic over an individual's sexual life course, which manifests as turnover\nbetween risk groups. We sought to examine the mechanisms by which turnover\ninfluences modelled projections of the tPAF of high risk groups. METHODS. We\ndeveloped a unifying, data-guided framework to simulate risk group turnover in\ndeterministic, compartmental transmission models. We applied the framework to\nan illustrative model of an STI and examined the mechanisms by which risk group\nturnover influenced equilibrium prevalence across risk groups. We then fit a\nmodel with and without turnover to the same risk-stratified STI prevalence\ntargets and compared the inferred level of risk heterogeneity and tPAF of the\nhighest risk group projected by the two models. RESULTS. The influence of\nturnover on group-specific prevalence was mediated by three main phenomena:\nmovement of infectious individuals between risk groups; changes to herd\nimmunity; and changes in discordant partnerships. Faster turnover led to a\nsmaller ratio of STI prevalence between the highest and lowest risk groups.\nCompared to the fitted model without turnover, the fitted model with turnover\ninferred greater risk heterogeneity and consistently projected a larger tPAF of\nthe highest risk group over time. IMPLICATIONS. If turnover is not captured in\nepidemic models, the projected contribution of high risk groups, and thus, the\npotential impact of prioritizing interventions to address their needs, could be\nunderestimated. To aid the next generation of tPAF models, data collection\nefforts to parameterize risk group turnover should be prioritized.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jan 2020 21:20:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-10"}

Applications include data transmission with a power constraint\nand, more recently, data storage on flash memories with a constraint on memory\ncell wear. In the latter application, system requirements often impose a rate\nconstraint. In this paper, we study rate-constrained fixed-to-variable length\nshaping codes for noiseless, memoryless costly channels and general i.i.d.\nsources. The analysis relies on the theory of word-valued sources. We establish\na relationship between the code expansion factor and minimum average symbol\ncost. We then determine the expansion factor that minimizes the average cost\nper source symbol (total cost), corresponding to a conventional optimal source\ncode with cost. An equivalence is established between codes minimizing average\nsymbol cost and codes minimizing total cost, and a separation theorem is\nproved, showing that optimal shaping can be achieved by a concatenation of\noptimal compression and optimal shaping for a uniform i.i.d. source. Shaping\ncodes often incorporate, either explicitly or implicitly, some form of\nnon-equiprobable signaling. We use our results to further explore the\nconnections between shaping codes and codes that map a sequence of i.i.d.\nsource symbols into an output sequence of symbols that are approximately\nindependent and distributed according to a specified target distribution, such\nas distribution matching (DM) codes. Optimal DM codes are characterized in\nterms of a new performance measure - generalized expansion factor (GEF) -\nmotivated by the costly channel perspective. The GEF is used to study DM codes\nthat minimize informational divergence and normalized informational divergence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jan 2020 21:29:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-10"}

We report here\nan advancement in the direct method with the implementation of adaptive mesh\nrefinement (AMR) and maintaining second-order accuracy, which breaks the\nbarrier set by uniform grid discretization. The adoption of graphic process\nunits (GPUs) can significantly speed up the computation and make application of\nthis method possible to astrophysical systems of gaseous disk galaxies and\nprotoplanetary disks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jan 2020 22:06:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-15"}

Experiments have shown their\neffectiveness on training deep neural networks. However, since only the first\ntwo moments are controlled in these BN techniques, it seems that a weak\nconstraint is imposed on layer distributions and furthermore whether such\nconstraint can reduce ICS is unknown. Thus this paper proposes a measure for\nICS by using the Earth Mover (EM) distance and then derives the upper and lower\nbounds for the measure to provide a theoretical analysis of BN. The upper bound\nhas shown that BN techniques can control ICS only for the outputs with low\ndimensions and small noise whereas their control is NOT effective in other\ncases.

While graphs are a standard model for pairwise\nrelationships, hypergraphs provide the flexibility to model multi-way\nrelationships, and are now a standard model for complex data and systems.\nHowever, when generalizing from graphs to hypergraphs, the notion of a \"cut\nhyperedge\" is less clear, as a hyperedge's nodes can be split in several ways.\nHere, we develop a framework for hypergraph cuts by considering the problem of\nseparating two terminal nodes in a hypergraph in a way that minimizes a sum of\npenalties at split hyperedges. In our setup, different ways of splitting the\nsame hyperedge have different penalties, and the penalty is encoded by what we\ncall a splitting function.\n  Our framework opens a rich space on the foundations of hypergraph cuts. We\nfirst identify a natural class of cardinality-based hyperedge splitting\nfunctions that depend only on the number of nodes on each side of the split. In\nthis case, we show that the general hypergraph $s$-$t$ cut problem can be\nreduced to a tractable graph $s$-$t$ cut problem if and only if the splitting\nfunctions are submodular. We also identify a wide regime of non-submodular\nsplitting functions for which the problem is NP-hard. We also analyze\nextensions to multiway cuts with at least three terminal nodes and identify a\nnatural class of splitting functions for which the problem can be reduced in an\napproximation-preserving way to the node-weighted multiway cut problem in\ngraphs, again subject to a submodularity property.

Our goal is to mitigate the application impact of crosstalk noise\nthrough software techniques. This requires (i) accurate characterization of\nhardware crosstalk, and (ii) intelligent instruction scheduling to serialize\nthe affected operations. Since crosstalk characterization is computationally\nexpensive, we develop optimizations which reduce the characterization overhead.\nOn three 20-qubit IBMQ systems, we demonstrate two orders of magnitude\nreduction in characterization time (compute time on the QC device) compared to\nall-pairs crosstalk measurements.

In doing so,\nhowever, the power of such representations is limited, where the same word\nmight be functionalized separately under different syntactic relations. To\naddress this limitation, one solution is to incorporate relational dependencies\nof different words into their embeddings. Therefore, in this paper, we propose\na multiplex word embedding model, which can be easily extended according to\nvarious relations among words. As a result, each word has a center embedding to\nrepresent its overall semantics, and several relational embeddings to represent\nits relational dependencies. Compared to existing models, our model can\neffectively distinguish words with respect to different relations without\nintroducing unnecessary sparseness. Moreover, to accommodate various relations,\nwe use a small dimension for relational embeddings and our model is able to\nkeep their effectiveness. Experiments on selectional preference acquisition and\nword similarity demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model, and a\nfurther study of scalability also proves that our embeddings only need 1/20 of\nthe original embedding size to achieve better performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jan 2020 04:47:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-10"}

But the inability to exactly\ndetermine the calibration coefficients corresponding to each observed CMB map\nfrom any CMB experiment makes it very difficult to incorporate their exact and\nactual values in a component separation analysis.

A popular model in\nhigh-dimensional multi-view data analysis is to decompose each view's data\nmatrix into a low-rank common-source matrix generated by latent factors common\nacross all data views, a low-rank distinctive-source matrix corresponding to\neach view, and an additive noise matrix. We propose a novel decomposition\nmethod for this model, called decomposition-based generalized canonical\ncorrelation analysis (D-GCCA). The D-GCCA rigorously defines the decomposition\non the L2 space of random variables in contrast to the Euclidean dot product\nspace used by most existing methods, thereby being able to provide the\nestimation consistency for the low-rank matrix recovery. Moreover, to well\ncalibrate common latent factors, we impose a desirable orthogonality constraint\non distinctive latent factors. Existing methods, however, inadequately consider\nsuch orthogonality and may thus suffer from substantial loss of undetected\ncommon-source variation. Our D-GCCA takes one step further than generalized\ncanonical correlation analysis by separating common and distinctive components\namong canonical variables, while enjoying an appealing interpretation from the\nperspective of principal component analysis. Furthermore, we propose to use the\nvariable-level proportion of signal variance explained by common or distinctive\nlatent factors for selecting the variables most influenced. Consistent\nestimators of our D-GCCA method are established with good finite-sample\nnumerical performance, and have closed-form expressions leading to efficient\ncomputation especially for large-scale data. The superiority of D-GCCA over\nstate-of-the-art methods is also corroborated in simulations and real-world\ndata examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jan 2020 06:35:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Dec 2021 04:33:58 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 16 Sep 2022 14:43:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-19"}

This work\nfurther explores this direction by proposing to couple SlfSL with SemSL. Our\ninsight is that the prediction target in SemSL can be modeled as the latent\nfactor in the predictor for the SlfSL target. Marginalizing over the latent\nfactor naturally derives a new formulation which marries the prediction targets\nof these two learning processes. By implementing this idea through a\nsimple-but-effective SlfSL approach -- rotation angle prediction, we create a\nnew SemSL approach called Conditional Rotation Angle Estimation (CRAE).\nSpecifically, CRAE is featured by adopting a module which predicts the image\nrotation angle conditioned on the candidate image class. Through experimental\nevaluation, we show that CRAE achieves superior performance over the other\nexisting ways of combining SlfSL and SemSL. To further boost CRAE, we propose\ntwo extensions to strengthen the coupling between SemSL target and SlfSL target\nin basic CRAE.

Usually 3D modeling is needed to calculate the coupling loss but\nit takes too much computing resource and time. In this paper, a numerical 2D\nmodeling by minimum electromagnetic entropy production (MEMEP) method is\ndeveloped to speed up the calculation. The presented MEMEP model shows good\naccuracy and the capability to take the realistic resistance between tapes into\naccount for coupling loss calculation with a high number of mesh element, which\nagrees to measurements.Thanks to the model, a systemic study of coupling loss\non amplitude-dependence, frequency-dependence, resistance-dependence, and\nlength-dependence, is presented and discussed. The results reveal the features\nof coupling loss which is very helpful devices with multi-tape conductors, such\nas the stator or rotor windings of motors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jan 2020 07:25:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-07"}

In applications of practical interest,\nboth of these problems are encountered, and standard methods either fail or are\nnot feasible. To overcome the current limitations, we present a generalized\nformulation of a Bayesian multi-fidelity Monte-Carlo (BMFMC) framework that can\nexploit lower-fidelity model versions in a small data regime. The goal of our\nanalysis is an efficient and accurate estimation of the complete probabilistic\nresponse for high-fidelity models. BMFMC circumvents the curse of\ndimensionality by learning the relationship between the outputs of a reference\nhigh-fidelity model and potentially several lower-fidelity models. While the\ncontinuous formulation is mathematically exact and independent of the\nlow-fidelity model's accuracy, we address challenges associated with the small\ndata regime (i.e., only a small number of 50 to 300 high-fidelity model runs\ncan be performed). Specifically, we complement the formulation with a set of\ninformative input features at no extra cost. Despite the inaccurate and noisy\ninformation that some low-fidelity models provide, we demonstrate that accurate\nand certifiable estimates for the quantities of interest can be obtained for\nuncertainty quantification problems in high stochastic dimensions, with\nsignificantly fewer high-fidelity model runs than state-of-the-art methods for\nuncertainty quantification.

The problem of covering a given environment using multiple robots\ncan be naturally formulated and studied as a multi-Traveling Salesperson\nProblem (mTSP). In a mTSP, the environment is represented as a graph and the\ngoal is to find tours (starting and ending at the same depot) for the robots in\norder to visit all the vertices with minimum global cost, namely the length of\nthe longest tour. The mTSP is an NP-hard problem for which several\napproximation algorithms have been proposed. These algorithms usually assume\ngeneric environments, but tighter approximation bounds can be reached focusing\non specific environments. In this paper, we address the case of environments\ncomposed of sub-parts, called modules, that can be reached from each other only\nthrough some linking structures. Examples are multi-floor buildings, in which\nthe modules are the floors and the linking structures are the staircases or the\nelevators, and floors of large hotels or hospitals, in which the modules are\nthe rooms and the linking structures are the corridors. We focus on linear\nmodular environments, with the modules organized sequentially, presenting an\nefficient (with polynomial worst-case time complexity) algorithm that finds a\nsolution for the mTSP whose cost is within a bounded distance from the cost of\nthe optimal solution.

Specifically, we present a new variant of graph neural networks,\nnamed spatial transformer, by dynamically modeling directed spatial\ndependencies with self-attention mechanism to capture realtime traffic\nconditions as well as the directionality of traffic flows. Furthermore,\ndifferent spatial dependency patterns can be jointly modeled with multi-heads\nattention mechanism to consider diverse relationships related to different\nfactors (e.g. similarity, connectivity and covariance). On the other hand, the\ntemporal transformer is utilized to model long-range bidirectional temporal\ndependencies across multiple time steps. Finally, they are composed as a block\nto jointly model the spatial-temporal dependencies for accurate traffic\nprediction.

In this work,\nfirst-principles ab initio calculations are performed to study the structural,\nelectronic and magnetic properties of BIG using Density Functional Theory with\nHubbard+U (DFT+U) correction including spin-orbit coupling and HSE06 hybrid\nfunctional. We found that the presence of spin gaps in the electronic structure\nresults from the interplay between exchange and correlation effects and the\ncrystal field strengths for tetrahedral and octahedral iron sublattices. The\nDFT+U treatment tends to close the spin-gaps for larger U due to\nover-localization effects, notably in the octahedral site.

Moreover, for those semiclassical states, the\nbounce remains symmetric, as in the vanishing cosmological constant case.\nHowever, we show that the behavior of the volume is more intricate for generic\nstates, leading in general to a non-symmetric bounce.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jan 2020 10:50:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 5 Feb 2020 10:48:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-06"}

The total energy cutoff of the high-order harmonic\nspectrum increases as a function of concentration of vacancy defects, and the\ntotal spectrum gradually turns into a single slanted spectrum without having an\nabrupt transition between primary and secondary plateaus. The spectral\nintensity of the below-band-gap harmonics in a solid with vacancy defects is\nenhanced significantly in comparison to the harmonics in a pristine solid. The\nchanges in the harmonic spectra are understood in terms of their effective band\nstructures. The presence of vacancy defects breaks the translational symmetry\nof the unit cell locally. As a consequence of this, new defect states appear,\nwhich open additional paths for the electron dynamics. The ill-resolved\nelectron trajectories in the Gabor profile confirm the interference of\nadditional paths. Moreover, the single slanted high-order harmonic spectrum\ncarries a unique signature of vacancy defects in comparison to the high-order\nharmonic spectrum corresponding to solids with defects such as underdoping or\noverdoping.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jan 2020 11:02:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-10"}

Several observatories around the globe have made\nthe record of sunspots in the form of drawings and preserved them safely for\nposterity.

In those times observations were recorded on photographic plates\nand after the development of those plates in the laboratory, the drawings of\nthe same were made on the Stonyhurst grids. In these drawings, called {\\em sun\ncharts}, different features on the sun's disk, e.g., sunspots, plages,\nfilaments, prominences, etc. were clearly identified and visually marked with\ndifferent colors. We have collected 111 years of sunspot drawing spanning over\n10 solar cycles. These sunspot drawings were carefully stitched to make bound\nvolumes, each for every 6-months. The drawings are kept at the Kodaikanal\nlibrary for scientific use and analysis. In this article, we describe briefly\nthe process of drawing, methods of counting sunspot numbers and measurement of\nsunspot area using square grids.

In the research\ncommunity, network tomography is generally investigated under the assumptions\nof known network topology, correlated path measurements, bounded number of\nfaulty nodes/links, or even special network protocol support. The applicability\nof network tomography is considerably constrained by these strong assumptions,\nwhich therefore frequently position it in the theoretical world. In this\nregard, we revisit network tomography from the practical perspective by\nestablishing a generic framework that does not rely on any of these assumptions\nor the types of performance metrics. Given only the end-to-end path performance\nmetrics of sampled node pairs, the proposed framework, NeuTomography, utilizes\ndeep neural network and data augmentation to predict the unmeasured performance\nmetrics via learning non-linear relationships between node pairs and underlying\nunknown topological/routing properties. In addition, NeuTomography can be\nemployed to reconstruct the original network topology, which is critical to\nmost network planning tasks.

The decoding\nschemes will be described for cyclic codes where polynomials can be used,\nhowever, the modification for non-cyclic codes is possible and straight\nforward. The hard decision decoding calculates syndrome polynomials which are\nthe product of the received polynomial with dual codewords. Proper cyclic\nshifts of these syndrome polynomials are obtained and the non-zero positions\nare counted componentwise for these shifts. The values of this counting are a\nreliability measure and can be used for locating the error and also the\nnon-error positions. This reliability measure is the basis for various variants\nof hard decision decoding algorithms. Decoding schemes with iterative error\nreduction are possible as well as information set decoding using the inherent\nreliability information of the measure even if there is no reliability\ninformation from the channel. Further, we will show how reliability information\nfrom the channel can be included in order to obtain soft decision decoding\nschemes. We derive the relation between bit flipping, believe propagation, and\nmajority logic decoding to the novel schemes. As examples to illustrate the\nfunctioning we use BCH and Reed-Muller codes as examples for binary codes, and\nRS codes for non-binary codes.

Since the population covariance matrix is not known, investors\nuse historical data to estimate it. Even though sample covariance matrix is an\nunbiased estimator of the population covariance matrix, it includes a great\namount of estimation error especially when the number of observed data is not\nmuch bigger than number of assets. As it is difficult to estimate the\ncovariance matrix with high dimensionality all at once, clustering stocks is\nproposed to come up with covariance matrix in two steps: firstly, within a\ncluster and secondly, between clusters. It decreases the estimation error by\nreducing the number of features in the data matrix. The motivation of this\ndissertation is that the estimation error can still remain high even after\nclustering, if a large amount of stocks is clustered together in a single\ngroup. This research proposes to utilize a bounded clustering method in order\nto limit the maximum cluster size. The result of experiments shows that not\nonly the gap between in-sample volatility and out-of-sample volatility\ndecreases, but also the out-of-sample volatility gets reduced.

Recent studies have suggested that\nthe amount of magnetic shear in these structures is a critical parameter for\nthe switch-on nature of magnetic reconnection in the solar atmosphere, at fluid\nspatial scales much larger than kinetic scales. We present results of\nsimulations of reconnection in 3D current sheets with conditions appropriate to\nthe solar corona. Using high-fidelity simulations, we follow the evolution of\nthe linear and non-linear 3D tearing instability, leading to reconnection.

In one regime, where the fastest growing\nparallel mode has sub-harmonics, the non-linear interaction of these\nsub-harmonics and the coalescence of 3D plasmoids dominates the non-linear\nevolution, with magnetic shear playing only a weak role in the amount of energy\nreleased.

Although\nthe excess has been mostly suggested to arise from some primary sources of\npositrons (such as pulsars and or annihilating dark matter particles), the\nalmost constant flux ratio of $e^{+}/ \\bar{p}$ argues for an alternative\npossibility that the excess positrons and antiprotons up to the highest\nenergies are secondary products generated in hadronic interactions. Recently,\nYang \\& Aharonian (2019) revisit this possibility by assuming the presence of\nan additional population of CR nuclei sources. Here we examine this secondary\nproduct scenario using the \\texttt{DRAGON} code, where the radiative loss of\npositrons is taken into account consistently. We confirm that the CR proton\nspectrum and the antiproton data can be explained by assuming the presence of\nan additional population of CR sources. However, the corresponding positron\nspectrum deviates from the measured data significantly above 100 GeV due to the\nstrong radiative cooling. This suggests that, although hadronic interactions\ncan explain the antiproton data, the corresponding secondary positron flux is\nstill not enough to account for the AMS data. Hence contribution from some\nprimary positron sources, such as pulsars or dark matter, is non-negligible.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jan 2020 13:42:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Apr 2020 02:44:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-03"}

This is an attempt to structure the nonlocality mess. \"Quantum\nnonlocality\" is Janus faced. One its face is projection (Einstein-L\\\"uders)\nnonlocality and another Bell nonlocality. The first one is genuine quantum\nnonlocality, the second one is subquantum nonlocality. Recently it was shown\nthat Bell \"nonlocality\" is a simple consequence of the complementarity\nprinciple. We now show that projection nonlocality has no connection with\nphysical space. Projection state update is generalization of the well known\noperation of probability update used in classical inference. We elevate the\nrole of interpretations of a quantum state. By using the individual (physical)\ninterpretation, one can really get the illusion of a spooky action at a\ndistance resulting from L\\\"uders' state update. The statistical interpretation\ncombined with treating the quantum formalism as machinery for update of\nprobability is known as the V\\\"axj\\\"o interpretation. Here one follows the\nstandard scheme of probability update adjusted to the quantum calculus of\nprobability. The latter is based on operating with states represented by\nvectors (or density operators). We present in parallel classical and quantum\nprobability updates. From this presentation, it is clear that both classical\nand quantum \"faster-than-light change of statistical correlation\" take place in\nmental and not physical space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jan 2020 13:48:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-18"}

Data locality and access patterns are often at the heart of\nperformance issues in computing systems due to the use of certain hardware\ntechniques to improve performance. Altering the access patterns to increase\nlocality can dramatically increase performance of a given algorithm. Besides,\nrepeated data access can be seen as redundancy in data movement. Similarly,\nthere can also be redundancy in the repetition of calculations. This work also\nidentifies some of the opportunities for avoiding these redundancies by\ndirectly reusing computation results. We start by motivating why and how a more\nefficient implementation can be achieved by exploiting reuse in the memory\nhierarchy of modern instruction set processors. Next we document the\npossibilities of such reuse in some selected machine learning algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jan 2020 14:16:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-10"}

VCM is\ncommitted to address the requirement of compact signal representation for both\nmachine and human vision in a more or less scalable way. To this end, we make\nendeavors in leveraging the strength of predictive and generative models to\nsupport advanced compression techniques for both machine and human vision tasks\nsimultaneously, in which visual features serve as a bridge to connect\nsignal-level and task-level compact representations in a scalable manner.\nSpecifically, we employ a conditional deep generation network to reconstruct\nvideo frames with the guidance of learned motion pattern. By learning to\nextract sparse motion pattern via a predictive model, the network elegantly\nleverages the feature representation to generate the appearance of to-be-coded\nframes via a generative model, relying on the appearance of the coded key\nframes. Meanwhile, the sparse motion pattern is compact and highly effective\nfor high-level vision tasks, e.g. action recognition.

We replace the 2-position (ortho) H on the phenyl\ngroup of the PEA cation with F, Cl, or Br to systematically increase the\ncation's cross-sectional area and mass and study changes in the excitonic\nstructure. These single atom substitutions substantially change the observable\nnumber of and spacing between discrete resonances in the excitonic absorption\nand PL spectra and drastically increase the amount of hot exciton PL that\nviolates Kasha's rule by over an order of magnitude. To fit the progressively\nlarger cations, the inorganic framework distorts and is strained, reducing the\nPb-I-Pb bond angles and increasing the 2DHP band gap. Correlation between the\n2DHP structure and steady-state and time-resolved spectra suggests the complex\nstructure of resonances arises from one or two manifolds of states, depending\non the 2DHP Pb-I-Pb bond angle (as)symmetry, and the resonances within a\nmanifold are regularly spaced with an energy separation that decreases as the\nmass of the cation increases. The uniform separation between resonances and the\ndynamics that show excitons can only relax to the next-lowest state are\nconsistent with a vibronic progression caused by a vibrational mode on the\ncation.

It improves traditional SDC (Static-Dynamic\nCache) that stores in a static cache the results of popular queries and manages\nthe dynamic cache with a replacement policy for intercepting the temporal\nvariations in the query stream.

Especially, when the exciton is abruptly generated on a\ntimescale faster than the typical lattice dynamics, the lattice displacement\ncannot follow adiabatically. Consequently, a rich dynamics on the picosecond\ntimescale of the coupled system is expected. In this study we combine\nsimulations and measurements of the ultrafast, coherent, nonlinear optical\nresponse, obtained by four-wave mixing spectroscopy, to resolve the formation\nof this polaron.

As more and more precise observations of Cepheids are secured over\never-increasing temporal baselines, our ignorance of the physics governing\nthese crucial stars is becoming increasingly clear. Thus, it is time to turn up\nthe magnification and investigate the limitations of our understanding of\nclassical pulsators. Of course, classical Cepheids are also standard candles\nthanks to the Leavitt law that allows to measure distances in the nearby\nUniverse. Nowadays, Cepheids serve as the backbone of a precisely calibrated\ndistance ladder that allows to measure Hubble's constant (H0) to better than\n2%, thus providing crucial constraints for precision cosmology. The recently\nestablished discord among H0 values measured in the late-time Universe and\ninferred from observations of the early Universe requires utmost diligence in\nestimating systematic uncertainties in order to strengthen the significance of\nthe results. In this presentation I focus on two main aspects of recent\nCepheid-related research. First, I present the Geneva Cepheid Radial Velocity\nsurvey (GE-CeRVS) and an update on the modulated spectroscopic variability\nexhibited by the 4 d Cepheid QZ Normae based on 8 years of monitoring. Then, I\ndiscuss some efforts directed towards a 1% H0 measurement needed for\nunderstanding the cosmological implications of discordant H0 values. Finally, I\nargue that now is a particularly opportune time to leverage the synergies\nbetween stellar physics and observational cosmology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jan 2020 14:43:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-10"}

The\ntransmitters send codewords which encode messages subject to input constraints.\nThe jammer, without knowing the transmitted codeword pair, injects adversarial\nnoise subject to state constraints so as to actively corrupt the communication\nfrom both users to the receiver. It was left as an open question by Cai (2016)\nto nail down the smallest list sizes for constrained AVMACs. Our inner and\nouter bounds are based on a judicious notion of symmetrizability for AVMACs\nintroduced by Cai (2016) with twists to incorporate input and state\nconstraints. The analysis follows techniques by Csisz\\'ar and Narayan (1988).\nWhen no constraints are imposed, our bound collapse to prior results by Cai\n(2016) which characterized the list-decoding capacity region of unconstrained\nAVMACs. Techniques used in this paper can also be extended to the Gaussian case\nand we characterize the list-decoding capacity region for Gaussian AVMACs. The\nconverse argument relies on a bounding technique recently used by Hosseinigoki\nand Kosut (2019).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jan 2020 15:10:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-10"}

When applied to\nclustered data, however, popular algorithms such as picking objects iteratively\nand performing local search lose their approximation guarantees towards maximum\nintra-cluster diversity because they fail to optimize the objective in a global\nmanner. We propose an algorithm that greedily adds a pair of objects instead of\na singleton, and which attains a constant approximation factor over clustered\ndata. We further extend the algorithm to the case of monotone and submodular\nquality function, and under a partition matroid constraint. We also devise a\ntechnique to make our algorithm scalable, and on the way we obtain a\nmodification that gives better solutions in practice while maintaining the\napproximation guarantee in theory.

We\nperform SPH simulations of misaligned gas and dust discs around binaries to\ninvestigate the different evolution of these two components. We choose two\ndifferent disc aspect ratios: A thin case for which the gas disc always breaks,\nand a thick one where a smooth warp develops throughout the disc. For each\ncase, we run simulations of five different dust species with different degrees\nof coupling with the gas component, varying in Stokes number from 0.002\n(strongly coupled dust) to 1000 (effectively decoupled dust). We report two new\nphenomena: First, large dust grains in thick discs pile up at the warp\nlocation, forming narrow dust rings, due to a difference in precession between\nthe gas and dust components. These pile ups do not form at gas pressure maxima,\nand hence are different from conventional dust traps. This effect is most\nevident for St ~ 10 - 100. Second, thin discs tear and break only in the gas,\nwhile dust particles with St > 10 form a dense dust trap due to the steep\npressure gradient caused by the break in the gas.

Periodic superlattices\nfacilitate coherent phonon thermal transport due to constructive wave\ninterference at the boundaries between the materials. However, it is possible\nto induce a crossover from coherent to incoherent transport regimes by\nadjusting the superlattice period. We have recently observed such crossover in\nperiodic graphene-boron nitride nanoribbons as the length of individual domains\nwas increased. In general, transport properties are dominated by translational\nsymmetry and the presence of unconventional symmetries leads to unusual\ntransport characteristics. Here we perform non-equilibrium molecular dynamics\nsimulations to investigate phonon heat transport in graphene-hBN superlattices\nfollowing the Fibonacci quasiperiodic sequence, which lie between periodic and\ndisordered structures.

In this work a model of FePt is constructed,\nwhere the induced Pt moment is simulated by using combined longitudinal and\nrotational spin dynamics. The model is parameterized to include a linear\nvariation of the moment with the exchange field, so that at the Pt site the\nmagnetic moment depends on the Fe ordering.

One example is\nthe camera augmented mobile C-arm (CAMC), which providesa real-time video\naugmentation onto medical images by rigidly mounting and calibrating a camera\nto the imagingdevice. Since then, several CAMC variations have been suggested\nby calibrating 2D/3D cameras, trackers, andmore recently a Microsoft HoloLens\nto the C-arm. Different calibration methods have been applied to establishthe\ncorrespondence between the rigidly attached sensor and the imaging device. A\ncrucial step for these methodsis the acquisition of X-Ray images or 3D\nreconstruction volumes; therefore, requiring the emission of ionizingradiation.\nIn this work, we analyze the mechanical motion of the device and propose an\nalternatative methodto calibrate sensors to the C-arm without emitting any\nradiation. Given a sensor is rigidly attached to thedevice, we introduce an\nextended pivot calibration concept to compute the fixed translation from the\nsensor tothe C-arm rotation center. The fixed relationship between the sensor\nand rotation center can be formulated as apivot calibration problem with the\npivot point moving on a locus. Our method exploits the rigid C-arm\nmotiondescribing a Torus surface to solve this calibration problem. We explain\nthe geometry of the C-arm motion andits relation to the attached sensor,\npropose a calibration algorithm and show its robustness against noise, as\nwellas trajectory and observed pose density by computer simulations.

Our results suggest that for a 10% increase\nin ridesourcing trips, we expect a 0.12% decrease in road crashes (p<0.05), a\n0.25% decrease in road injuries (p<0.001), and a 0.36% decrease in DWI offenses\n(p<0.0001) in Travis County. Ridesourcing use is not associated with road\nfatalities at a 0.05 significance level. This study augments existing work\nbecause it moves beyond binary indicators of ridesourcing presence or absence\nand analyzes patterns within an urbanized area rather than metropolitan-level\nvariation. Contributions include developing a data-rich approach for assessing\nthe impacts of ridesourcing use on our transportation system's safety, which\nmay serve as a template for future analyses of other US cities. Our findings\nprovide feedback to policymakers by clarifying associations between\nridesourcing use and traffic safety, while helping identify sets of actions to\nachieve safer and more efficient shared mobility systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jan 2020 22:36:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Jun 2020 20:59:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 2020 22:34:53 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2021 02:48:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-22"}

By conducting\ncomprehensive characterizations on different kinds of parallel rendering\nframeworks, we observe that distributing the rendering object along with its\nrequired data per GPM can reduce the inter-GPM memory accesses.

This work describes an object copy-on-write\nplatform to automate this saving for the programmer. The core idea is\nformalized using labeled directed multigraphs, where vertices represent\nobjects, edges the pointers between them, and labels the necessary bookkeeping.\nA specific labeling scheme is proposed for high performance under the\nmotivating pattern. The platform is implemented for the Birch probabilistic\nprogramming language, using smart pointers, hash tables, and reference-counting\ngarbage collection. It is tested empirically on a number of realistic\nprobabilistic programs, and shown to significantly reduce memory use and\nexecution time in a manner consistent with theoretical expectations. This\nenables copy-on-write for the imperative programmer, lazy deep copies for the\nobject-oriented programmer, and in-place write optimizations for the functional\nprogrammer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 9 Jan 2020 00:52:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-16"}

Unfortunately, many\nsocial desiderata concerning consequential decisions, such as justice or\nfairness, have no natural formulation within a purely predictive framework. In\nefforts to mitigate these problems, researchers have proposed a variety of\nmetrics for quantifying deviations from various statistical parities that we\nmight expect to observe in a fair world and offered a variety of algorithms in\nattempts to satisfy subsets of these parities or to trade off the degree to\nwhich they are satisfied against utility. In this paper, we connect this\napproach to \\emph{fair machine learning} to the literature on ideal and\nnon-ideal methodological approaches in political philosophy. The ideal approach\nrequires positing the principles according to which a just world would operate.\nIn the most straightforward application of ideal theory, one supports a\nproposed policy by arguing that it closes a discrepancy between the real and\nthe perfectly just world. However, by failing to account for the mechanisms by\nwhich our non-ideal world arose, the responsibilities of various\ndecision-makers, and the impacts of proposed policies, naive applications of\nideal thinking can lead to misguided interventions.

Simulating this mechanism at\nthe continuum level is computationally expensive or, in some cases,\nintractable. The computational cost is due to the need for highly resolved\ncomputational meshes required to capture complex crack growth behavior, such as\nbranching, turning, etc. Typically, continuum-scale models that account for\nbrittle damage evolution homogenize the crack network in some way, which\nreduces the overall computational cost, but can also neglect key physics of the\nsubgrid crack growth behavior, sacrificing accuracy for efficiency. We have\ndeveloped an approach using machine learning that overcomes the current\ninability to represent micro-scale physics at the macro-scale. Our approach\nleverages damage and stress data from a high-fidelity model that explicitly\nresolves microcrack behavior to build an inexpensive machine learning emulator,\nwhich runs in seconds as opposed to the high-fidelity model, which takes hours.\nOnce trained, the machine learning emulator is used to predict the evolution of\ncrack length statistics. A continuum-scale constitutive model is then informed\nwith these crack statistics, speeding up the workflow by four orders of\nmagnitude. Both the machine learning model and the continuum-scale model are\nvalidated against a high-fidelity model and experimental data, respectively,\nshowing excellent agreement. There are two key findings. The first is that we\ncan reduce the dimensionality of the problem, establishing that the machine\nlearning emulator only needs the length of the longest crack and one of the\nmaximum stress components to capture the necessary physics.
