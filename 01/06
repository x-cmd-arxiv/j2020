Therefore, the\nthreat of Deepfake to be used for a variety of malicious intents such as\npropagating fake images and videos becomes prevalent. And detecting these\nmachine-generated fake images has been quite challenging than ever. In this\nwork, we propose a light-weight robust fine-tuning neural network-based\nclassifier architecture called Fake Detection Fine-tuning Network (FDFtNet),\nwhich is capable of detecting many of the new fake face image generation\nmodels, and can be easily combined with existing image classification networks\nand finetuned on a few datasets. In contrast to many existing methods, our\napproach aims to reuse popular pre-trained models with only a few images for\nfine-tuning to effectively detect fake images. The core of our approach is to\nintroduce an image-based self-attention module called Fine-Tune Transformer\nthat uses only the attention module and the down-sampling layer. This module is\nadded to the pre-trained model and fine-tuned on a few data to search for new\nsets of feature space to detect fake images. We experiment with our FDFtNet on\nthe GANsbased dataset (Progressive Growing GAN) and Deepfake-based dataset\n(Deepfake and Face2Face) with a small input image resolution of 64x64 that\ncomplicates detection. Our FDFtNet achieves an overall accuracy of 90.29% in\ndetecting fake images generated from the GANs-based dataset, outperforming the\nstate-of-the-art.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Jan 2020 16:04:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 Aug 2020 06:08:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-11"}

However, such Layer-2 solutions have their own\nproblems: payment channels require a separate deposit towards each merchant and\nthus significant locked-in funds from customers; payment hubs require very\nlarge operator deposits that depend on the number of customers; and side-chains\nrequire trusted validators.\n  In this paper, we propose Snappy, a novel solution that enables recipients,\nlike merchants, to safely accept fast payments.

Besides receiving payments, merchants also act as\nstatekeepers who collectively track and approve incoming payments using\nmajority voting. In case of a double-spending attack, the victim merchant can\nrecover lost funds either from the collateral of the malicious customer or a\ncolluding statekeeper (merchant). Snappy overcomes the main problems of\nprevious solutions: a single customer collateral can be used to shop with many\nmerchants; merchant collaterals are independent of the number of customers; and\nvalidators do not have to be trusted.

The tractor curvature encodes the presence of\ngravitational waves and the non-uniqueness of flat null-normal tractor\nconnections correspond to the \"degeneracy of gravity vacua\" that has been\nextensively discussed in the literature. This work thus brings back the\ninvestigation of the radiative phase space of gravity to the study of (Cartan)\nconnections and associated bundles.

Compared to the traditional Partial Label Learning (PLL)\nproblem, GPLL relaxes the supervision assumption from instance-level -- a label\nset partially labels an instance -- to group-level: 1) a label set partially\nlabels a group of instances, where the within-group instance-label link\nannotations are missing, and 2) cross-group links are allowed -- instances in a\ngroup may be partially linked to the label set from another group. Such\nambiguous group-level supervision is more practical in real-world scenarios as\nadditional annotation on the instance-level is no longer required, e.g.,\nface-naming in videos where the group consists of faces in a frame, labeled by\na name set in the corresponding caption. In this paper, we propose a novel\ngraph convolutional network (GCN) called Dual Bipartite Graph Autoencoder\n(DB-GAE) to tackle the label ambiguity challenge of GPLL. First, we exploit the\ncross-group correlations to represent the instance groups as dual bipartite\ngraphs: within-group and cross-group, which reciprocally complements each other\nto resolve the linking ambiguities. Second, we design a GCN autoencoder to\nencode and decode them, where the decodings are considered as the refined\nresults. It is worth noting that DB-GAE is self-supervised and transductive, as\nit only uses the group-level supervision without a separate offline training\nstage. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate that DB-GAE\nsignificantly outperforms the best baseline over absolute 0.159 F1-score and\n24.8% accuracy.

Confirmed detections of\nechoes at the current levels of instrumental sensitivity can constrain the\ndimensionless value of tidal charge to $|Q| \\lesssim M^2$ .\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Jan 2020 19:45:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 May 2020 04:53:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-20"}

Particularly, increasing attention\nhas been drawn towards its application in agriculture. Nevertheless, while\nvisual pattern recognition on farmlands carries enormous economic values,\nlittle progress has been made to merge computer vision and crop sciences due to\nthe lack of suitable agricultural image datasets. Meanwhile, problems in\nagriculture also pose new challenges in computer vision. For example, semantic\nsegmentation of aerial farmland images requires inference over extremely\nlarge-size images with extreme annotation sparsity. These challenges are not\npresent in most of the common object datasets, and we show that they are more\nchallenging than many other aerial image datasets. To encourage research in\ncomputer vision for agriculture, we present Agriculture-Vision: a large-scale\naerial farmland image dataset for semantic segmentation of agricultural\npatterns. We collected 94,986 high-quality aerial images from 3,432 farmlands\nacross the US, where each image consists of RGB and Near-infrared (NIR)\nchannels with resolution as high as 10 cm per pixel. We annotate nine types of\nfield anomaly patterns that are most important to farmers. As a pilot study of\naerial agricultural semantic segmentation, we perform comprehensive experiments\nusing popular semantic segmentation models; we also propose an effective model\ndesigned for aerial agricultural pattern recognition.

We extend these\ncharacterizations, in both the continuous and discrete cases, by replacing\nconvexity with a less restrictive condition. In the continuous case,\nAlessandrini and Nesi provide a characterization of invertible harmonic maps\ninto non-convex domains with a smooth boundary by adding additional conditions\non orientation preservation along the boundary. We extend their results by\ndefining a condition on the normal derivatives along the boundary, which we\ncall the cone condition; this condition is tractable and geometrically\nintuitive, encoding a weak notion of local invertibility. The cone condition\nenables us to extend Alessandrini and Nesi to the case of harmonic maps into\nnon-convex domains with a piecewise-smooth boundary. In the discrete case, we\nuse an analog of the cone condition to characterize invertible\ndiscrete-harmonic piecewise-linear maps of triangulations. This gives an analog\nof our continuous results and characterizes invertible discrete-harmonic maps\nin terms of the orientation of triangles incident on the boundary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Jan 2020 22:26:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-07"}

One pixel in the image\ncorresponds to a one millimeter piece of tissue. In order to accurately segment\ntumors and make treatment plans, doctors need CT scans of higher resolution.\nThe same problem appears in MRI. In this paper, we propose an approach for the\nsingle-image super-resolution of 3D CT or MRI scans. Our method is based on\ndeep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) composed of 10 convolutional layers\nand an intermediate upscaling layer that is placed after the first 6\nconvolutional layers. Our first CNN, which increases the resolution on two axes\n(width and height), is followed by a second CNN, which increases the resolution\non the third axis (depth). Different from other methods, we compute the loss\nwith respect to the ground-truth high-resolution output right after the\nupscaling layer, in addition to computing the loss after the last convolutional\nlayer. The intermediate loss forces our network to produce a better output,\ncloser to the ground-truth. A widely-used approach to obtain sharp results is\nto add Gaussian blur using a fixed standard deviation. In order to avoid\noverfitting to a fixed standard deviation, we apply Gaussian smoothing with\nvarious standard deviations, unlike other approaches. We evaluate our method in\nthe context of 2D and 3D super-resolution of CT and MRI scans from two\ndatabases, comparing it to relevant related works from the literature and\nbaselines based on various interpolation schemes, using 2x and 4x scaling\nfactors.

This study seeks to evaluate if pedestrians clearly\nunderstand the driving intentions of AVs in interactions and presents\nexperimental research on the relationship between gaze behaviors of pedestrians\nand their understanding of the intentions of the AV. The hypothesis\ninvestigated in this study was that the less the pedestrian understands the\ndriving intentions of the AV, the longer the duration of their gazing behavior\nwill be. A pedestrian--vehicle interaction experiment was designed to verify\nthe proposed hypothesis. A robotic wheelchair was used as the manual driving\nvehicle (MV) and AV for interacting with pedestrians while pedestrians' gaze\ndata and their subjective evaluation of the driving intentions were recorded.\nThe experimental results supported our hypothesis as there was a negative\ncorrelation between the pedestrians' gaze duration on the AV and their\nunderstanding of the driving intentions of the AV. Moreover, the gaze duration\nof most of the pedestrians on the MV was shorter than that on an AV. Therefore,\nwe conclude with two recommendations to designers of external human-machine\ninterfaces (eHMI): (1) when a pedestrian is engaged in an interaction with an\nAV, the driving intentions of the AV should be provided; (2) if the pedestrian\nstill gazes at the AV after the AV displays its driving intentions, the AV\nshould provide clearer information about its driving intentions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jan 2020 00:24:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 May 2020 06:03:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-08"}

These models usually involve\nseveral parameters, such as the kinetic rates of chemical reactions, that are\nnot directly measurable and must be inferred from experimental data. Bayesian\ninference provides a rigorous probabilistic framework for identifying these\nparameters by finding a posterior parameter distribution that captures their\nuncertainty. Traditional computational methods for solving inference problems\nsuch as Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods based on classical Metropolis-Hastings\nalgorithm involve numerous serial evaluations of the likelihood function, which\nin turn requires expensive forward solutions of the chemical master equation\n(CME). We propose an alternative approach based on a multifidelity extension of\nthe Sequential Tempered Markov Chain Monte Carlo (ST-MCMC) sampler. This\nalgorithm is built upon Sequential Monte Carlo and solves the Bayesian\ninference problem by decomposing it into a sequence of efficiently solved\nsubproblems that gradually increase model fidelity and the influence of the\nobserved data. We reformulate the finite state projection (FSP) algorithm, a\nwell-known method for solving the CME, to produce a hierarchy of surrogate\nmaster equations to be used in this multifidelity scheme. To determine the\nappropriate fidelity, we introduce a novel information-theoretic criteria that\nseeks to extract the most information about the ultimate Bayesian posterior\nfrom each model in the hierarchy without inducing significant bias.

In this paper, we propose\na novel approach to slice-based resource allocation named Guaranteed seRvice\nEfficient nETwork slicing (GREET). The underlying concept is to set up a\nconstrained resource allocation game, where (i) slices unilaterally optimize\ntheir allocations to best meet their (dynamic) customer loads, while (ii)\nconstraints are imposed to guarantee that, if they wish so, slices receive a\npre-agreed share of the network resources. The resulting game is a variation of\nthe well-known Fisher market, where slices are provided a budget to contend for\nnetwork resources (as in a traditional Fisher market), but (unlike a Fisher\nmarket) prices are constrained for some resources to provide the desired\nguarantees. In this way, GREET combines the advantages of a share-based\napproach (high efficiency by flexible sharing) and reservation-based ones\n(which provide guarantees by assigning a fixed amount of resources).

Here present 17 new TDEs that have been detected recently by the\nZwicky Transient Facility along with Swift UV and X-ray follow-up observations.\nOur homogeneous analysis of the optical/UV light curves, including 22\npreviously known TDEs from the literature, reveals a clean separation of light\ncurve properties with spectroscopic class. The TDEs with Bowen fluorescence\nfeatures in their optical spectra have smaller blackbody radii, as well as\nlonger rise times and higher disruption rates compared to the rest of the\nsample. The Bowen fluorescence mechanism requires a high density which can be\nreached at smaller radii, which in turn yields longer diffusion timescales.\nThus, the difference in rise times suggests the pre-peak TDE light curves are\ngoverned not by the fallback timescale, but instead by the diffusion of photons\nthrough the tidal debris. The small subset of TDEs that show only helium\nemission lines in their spectra have the longest rise times, the highest\nluminosities and the lowest rates. We also report, for the first time, the\ndetection of soft X-ray flares from a TDE on day timescales. Based on the fact\nthe flares peak at a luminosity similar to the optical/UV blackbody luminosity,\nwe attribute them to brief glimpses through a reprocessing layer that otherwise\nobscures the inner accretion flow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jan 2020 05:37:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-17"}

As the system exhibits oscillatory interlayer\nexchange coupling (IEC) with varying Ir layer thickness, we compare the SOT of\nfilms when the Co layers are coupled ferromagnetically and\nantiferromagnetically. SOT is evaluated using current induced shift of the\nanomalous Hall resistance hysteresis loops. A relatively thick Pt layer,\nserving as a seed layer to the multilayer, is used to generate spin current via\nthe spin Hall effect. In the absence of antiferromagnetic coupling, the SOT is\nconstant against the applied current density and the corresponding spin torque\nefficiency (i.e. the effective spin Hall angle) is $\\sim$0.09, in agreement\nwith previous reports. In contrast, for films with antiferromagnetic coupling,\nthe SOT increases with the applied current density and eventually saturates.\nThe SOT at saturation is a factor of $\\sim$15 larger than that without the\nantiferromagnetic coupling. The spin torque efficiency is $\\sim$5 times larger\nif we assume the net total magnetization is reduced by a factor of 3 due to the\nantiferromagnetic coupling. Model calculations based on the Landau Lifshitz\nGilbert equation show that the presence of antiferromagnetic coupling can\nincrease the SOT but the degree of enhancement is limited, in this case, to a\nfactor of 1.2-1.4. We thus consider there are other sources of SOT, possibly at\nthe interfaces, which may account for the highly efficient SOT in the\nuncompensated synthetic anti-ferromagnet (SAF) multilayers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jan 2020 09:41:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-19"}

A (proper) $k$-edge-coloring is a coloring of the\nedges of $G$ such that any pair of edges sharing an endpoint receive distinct\ncolors. A classical result of Vizing ensures that any simple graph $G$ admits a\n$(\\Delta(G)+1)$-edge coloring where $\\Delta(G)$ denotes the maximum degreee of\n$G$. Recently, Cabello raised the following question: given two graphs\n$G_1,G_2$ of maximum degree $\\Delta$ on the same set of vertices $V$, is it\npossible to edge-color their (edge) union with $\\Delta+2$ colors in such a way\nthe restriction of $G$ to respectively the edges of $G_1$ and the edges of\n$G_2$ are edge-colorings? More generally, given $\\ell$ graphs, how many colors\ndo we need to color their union in such a way the restriction of the coloring\nto each graph is proper?\n  In this short note, we prove that we can always color the union of the graphs\n$G_1,\\ldots,G_\\ell$ of maximum degree $\\Delta$ with $\\Omega(\\sqrt{\\ell} \\cdot\n\\Delta)$ colors and that there exist graphs for which this bound is tight up to\na constant multiplicative factor.

A major hurdle to this objective is\nthat these images often contain information in the form of tables and\nextracting data from tabular sub-images presents a unique set of challenges.\nThis includes accurate detection of the tabular region within an image, and\nsubsequently detecting and extracting information from the rows and columns of\nthe detected table. While some progress has been made in table detection,\nextracting the table contents is still a challenge since this involves more\nfine grained table structure(rows & columns) recognition. Prior approaches have\nattempted to solve the table detection and structure recognition problems\nindependently using two separate models. In this paper, we propose TableNet: a\nnovel end-to-end deep learning model for both table detection and structure\nrecognition. The model exploits the interdependence between the twin tasks of\ntable detection and table structure recognition to segment out the table and\ncolumn regions. This is followed by semantic rule-based row extraction from the\nidentified tabular sub-regions. The proposed model and extraction approach was\nevaluated on the publicly available ICDAR 2013 and Marmot Table datasets\nobtaining state of the art results. Additionally, we demonstrate that feeding\nadditional semantic features further improves model performance and that the\nmodel exhibits transfer learning across datasets. Another contribution of this\npaper is to provide additional table structure annotations for the Marmot data,\nwhich currently only has annotations for table detection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jan 2020 10:25:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-07"}

However, domain diversities between different\ndatasets pose an evident challenge for adapting the re-ID model trained on one\ndataset to another one. State-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation methods\nfor person re-ID transferred the learned knowledge from the source domain by\noptimizing with pseudo labels created by clustering algorithms on the target\ndomain. Although they achieved state-of-the-art performances, the inevitable\nlabel noise caused by the clustering procedure was ignored. Such noisy pseudo\nlabels substantially hinders the model's capability on further improving\nfeature representations on the target domain. In order to mitigate the effects\nof noisy pseudo labels, we propose to softly refine the pseudo labels in the\ntarget domain by proposing an unsupervised framework, Mutual Mean-Teaching\n(MMT), to learn better features from the target domain via off-line refined\nhard pseudo labels and on-line refined soft pseudo labels in an alternative\ntraining manner. In addition, the common practice is to adopt both the\nclassification loss and the triplet loss jointly for achieving optimal\nperformances in person re-ID models. However, conventional triplet loss cannot\nwork with softly refined labels. To solve this problem, a novel soft\nsoftmax-triplet loss is proposed to support learning with soft pseudo triplet\nlabels for achieving the optimal domain adaptation performance.

Our method is inspired by the observation that\nnetworks trained on less imbalanced subsets of the distribution often yield\nbetter performances than their jointly-trained counterparts. We refer to these\nmodels as 'Experts', and the proposed LFME framework aggregates the knowledge\nfrom multiple 'Experts' to learn a unified student model. Specifically, the\nproposed framework involves two levels of adaptive learning schedules:\nSelf-paced Expert Selection and Curriculum Instance Selection, so that the\nknowledge is adaptively transferred to the 'Student'. We conduct extensive\nexperiments and demonstrate that our method is able to achieve superior\nperformances compared to state-of-the-art methods. We also show that our method\ncan be easily plugged into state-of-the-art long-tailed classification\nalgorithms for further improvements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jan 2020 12:57:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Jul 2020 05:21:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 21 Sep 2020 02:44:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-22"}

However, two problems remain unsolved, which are\nclosely related to model generalizability to noisy conditions: (1) mismatched\nnoisy condition during testing, i.e., the performance is generally sub-optimal\nwhen models are tested with unseen noise types that are not involved in the\ntraining data; (2) local focus on specific noisy conditions, i.e., models\ntrained using multiple types of noises cannot optimally remove a specific noise\ntype even though the noise type has been involved in the training data. These\nproblems are common in real applications. In this paper, we propose a novel\ndenoising autoencoder with a multi-branched encoder (termed DAEME) model to\ndeal with these two problems. In the DAEME model, two stages are involved:\ntraining and testing. In the training stage, we build multiple component models\nto form a multi-branched encoder based on a decision tree (DSDT). The DSDT is\nbuilt based on prior knowledge of speech and noisy conditions (the speaker,\nenvironment, and signal factors are considered in this paper), where each\ncomponent of the multi-branched encoder performs a particular mapping from\nnoisy to clean speech along the branch in the DSDT. Finally, a decoder is\ntrained on top of the multi-branched encoder. In the testing stage, noisy\nspeech is first processed by each component model. The multiple outputs from\nthese models are then integrated into the decoder to determine the final\nenhanced speech. Experimental results show that DAEME is superior to several\nbaseline models in terms of objective evaluation metrics, automatic speech\nrecognition results, and quality in subjective human listening tests.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jan 2020 13:03:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 11 Jan 2020 12:44:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 25 Dec 2020 01:58:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-29"}

In this paper, we explore the remaining redundancy of recent\nlearned compression algorithms. We have found accurate entropy models for rate\nestimation largely affect the optimization of network parameters and thus\naffect the rate-distortion performance. Therefore, in this paper, we propose to\nuse discretized Gaussian Mixture Likelihoods to parameterize the distributions\nof latent codes, which can achieve a more accurate and flexible entropy model.\nBesides, we take advantage of recent attention modules and incorporate them\ninto network architecture to enhance the performance.

However, such\nmodels have a limited generalization ability under the scale and location\nmismatch between objects, as only few samples from target classes are provided.\nTherefore, the lack of a mechanism to match the scale and location between\npairs of compared images leads to the performance degradation. The importance\nof image contents varies across coarse-to-fine scales depending on the object\nand its class label, e.g., generic objects and scenes rely on their global\nappearance while fine-grained objects rely more on their localized visual\npatterns. In this paper, we study the impact of scale and location mismatch in\nthe few-shot learning scenario, and propose a novel Spatially-aware Matching\n(SM) scheme to effectively perform matching across multiple scales and\nlocations, and learn image relations by giving the highest weights to the best\nmatching pairs. The SM is trained to activate the most related locations and\nscales between support and query data.

Such an approach works well when\nsupervision is available, but in problems like human pose and shape estimation,\nit is difficult to obtain natural images with 3D ground truth. To go one step\nfurther, we propose a new architecture that facilitates unsupervised, or\nlightly supervised, learning. The idea is to break the problem into a series of\ntransformations between increasingly abstract representations.

The observed spatial\ndistribution of the methanol maser cloudlets and the measured time delays of\nthe flares of individual features imply a ring-like structure of radius 240au\nand thickness 30au.

The method requires repeated\nlinearization of large nonlinear systems and produces ill-condi\\-tioned linear\nsystems. We present a strategy to reduce computational time that relies on two\nkey ideas: (\\textit{i}) a sequential formulation that decouples flow and\ntransport into separate subproblems, and (\\textit{ii}) a highly efficient\nGauss--Seidel solver for the transport problems. This solver uses intercell\nfluxes to reorder the grid cells according to their upstream neighbors, and\ngroups cells that are mutually dependent because of counter-current flow into\nlocal clusters. The cells and local clusters can then be solved in sequence,\nstarting from the inflow and moving gradually downstream, since each new cell\nor local cluster will only depend on upstream neighbors that have already been\ncomputed. Altogether, this gives optimal localization and control of the\nnonlinear solution process.\n  This method has been successfully applied to real-field problems using the\nstandard first-order finite volume discretization. Here, we extend the idea to\nfirst-order dG methods on fully unstructured grids. We also demonstrate proof\nof concept for the reordering idea by applying it to the full simulation model\nof the Norne oil field, using a prototype variant of the open-source OPM Flow\nsimulator.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jan 2020 15:29:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-07"}

The aim of this work is to\nprovide experimental insights into pathways of photochemistry-driven molecular\ngrowth within outer CSEs to draw a more complete picture of the chemical\nprocesses occurring within these molecule-rich environments. A simplified CSE\nenvironment was therefore reproduced in the laboratory through gas-phase\nexperiments exposing relevant gas mixtures to an Extreme UltraViolet (EUV)\nphoton source. This photochemical reactor should ultimately allow us to\ninvestigate chemical processes and their resulting products occurring under\nconditions akin to outer CSEs. We used a recently developed EUV lamp coupled to\nthe APSIS photochemical cell to irradiate CSE relevant gas mixtures of H$_2$,\nCO and N$_2$, at one wavelength, 73.6 nm. The detection and identification of\nchemical species in the photochemical reactor was achieved through in-situ mass\nspectrometry analysis of neutral and cationic molecules. We find that exposing\nCO-N$_2$-H$_2$ gas mixtures to EUV photons at 73.6 nm induces photochemical\nreactions that yield the formation of complex, neutral and ionic species.

This work presents an adaptive data-driven innovative modular\napproach for solving the real-world Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP) in the field\nof logistics. The work consists of two basic units: (i) an innovative\nmulti-step algorithm for successful and entirely feasible solving of the VRP\nproblems in logistics, (ii) an adaptive approach for adjusting and setting up\nparameters and constants of the proposed algorithm. The proposed algorithm\ncombines several data transformation approaches, heuristics and Tabu search.\nMoreover, as the performance of the algorithm depends on the set of control\nparameters and constants, a predictive model that adaptively adjusts these\nparameters and constants according to historical data is proposed. A comparison\nof the acquired results has been made using the Decision Support System with\npredictive models: Generalized Linear Models (GLM) and Support Vector Machine\n(SVM). The algorithm, along with the control parameters, which using the\nprediction method were acquired, was incorporated into a web-based enterprise\nsystem, which is in use in several big distribution companies in Bosnia and\nHerzegovina. The results of the proposed algorithm were compared with a set of\nbenchmark instances and validated over real benchmark instances as well.

The key challenge for video SR lies in the\neffective exploitation of temporal dependency between consecutive frames.\nExisting deep learning based methods commonly estimate optical flows between LR\nframes to provide temporal dependency. However, the resolution conflict between\nLR optical flows and HR outputs hinders the recovery of fine details. In this\npaper, we propose an end-to-end video SR network to super-resolve both optical\nflows and images. Optical flow SR from LR frames provides accurate temporal\ndependency and ultimately improves video SR performance. Specifically, we first\npropose an optical flow reconstruction network (OFRnet) to infer HR optical\nflows in a coarse-to-fine manner. Then, motion compensation is performed using\nHR optical flows to encode temporal dependency. Finally, compensated LR inputs\nare fed to a super-resolution network (SRnet) to generate SR results.

We explain how most, if not\nall, of the complex phenomena commonly seen can be described by a model in\nwhich the underlying resonance is a single-pole Lorentzian, but whose centre\nfrequency and quality factor change as external parameters, such as readout\npower and frequency, are varied. What is seen during a vector-network-analyser\nmeasurement is series of samples taken from an ideal Lorentzian that is\nshifting and spreading as the readout frequency is changed. According to this\nmodel, it is perfectly proper to refer to, and measure, the resonant frequency\nand quality factor of the underlying resonance, even though the swept-frequency\ncurves appear highly distorted and hysteretic. In those cases where the\nresonance curve is highly distorted, the specific shape of the trajectory in\nthe Argand plane gives valuable insights into the second-order physical\nprocesses present. We discuss the formulation and consequences of this approach\nin the case of non-linear kinetic inductance, two-level-system loss,\nquasiparticle generation, and a generic model based on a power-law form. The\ngeneric model captures the key features of specific dissipative\nnon-linearities, but additionally leads to insights into how general\ndissipative processes create characteristic forms in the Argand plane. We\nprovide detailed formulations in each case, and indicate how they lead to the\nwide variety of phenomena commonly seen in experimental data.

However, designing DNN chips is non-trivial because: (1)\nmainstream DNNs have millions of parameters and operations; (2) the large\ndesign space due to the numerous design choices of dataflows, processing\nelements, memory hierarchy, etc.; and (3) an algorithm/hardware co-design is\nneeded to allow the same DNN functionality to have a different decomposition,\nwhich would require different hardware IPs to meet the application\nspecifications. Therefore, DNN chips take a long time to design and require\ncross-disciplinary experts. To enable fast and effective DNN chip design, we\npropose AutoDNNchip - a DNN chip generator that can automatically generate both\nFPGA- and ASIC-based DNN chip implementation given DNNs from machine learning\nframeworks (e.g., PyTorch) for a designated application and dataset.\nSpecifically, AutoDNNchip consists of two integrated enablers: (1) a Chip\nPredictor, built on top of a graph-based accelerator representation, which can\naccurately and efficiently predict a DNN accelerator's energy, throughput, and\narea based on the DNN model parameters, hardware configuration,\ntechnology-based IPs, and platform constraints; and (2) a Chip Builder, which\ncan automatically explore the design space of DNN chips (including IP\nselection, block configuration, resource balancing, etc.), optimize chip design\nvia the Chip Predictor, and then generate optimized synthesizable RTL to\nachieve the target design metrics. Experimental results show that our Chip\nPredictor's predicted performance differs from real-measured ones by < 10% when\nvalidated using 15 DNN models and 4 platforms (edge-FPGA/TPU/GPU and ASIC).\nFurthermore, accelerators generated by our AutoDNNchip can achieve better (up\nto 3.86X improvement) performance than that of expert-crafted state-of-the-art\naccelerators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 Jan 2020 05:32:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Feb 2020 17:02:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 22 Mar 2020 18:53:08 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 10 Jun 2020 23:50:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-12"}

However, the suspension properties are difficult to change once\nthe devices are fabricated. Vanadium dioxide (VO$_2$) is a phase change\nmaterial, which undergoes a transition from a low-temperature insulating phase\nto a high-temperature metallic phase around a temperature of 340 K. In this\nwork, we study Casimir forces between a nanoplate (gold or Teflon) and a\nlayered structure containing a VO$_2$ film. It is found that stable Casimir\nsuspensions of nanoplates can be realized in a liquid environment, and the\nequilibrium distances are determined, not only by the layer thicknesses but\nalso by the matter phases of VO$_2$. Under proper designs, a switch from\nquantum trapping of the gold nanoplate (\"on\" state) to its release (\"off\"\nstate) as a result of the metal-to-insulator transition of VO$_2$, is revealed.\nOn the other hand, the quantum trapping and release of a Teflon nanoplate is\nfound under the insulator-to-metal transition of VO$_2 $.
