In contrast to the traditional last-mile logistics services, smart\nlogistics service with autonomous driving technologies provides a promising\nsolution to reduce the delivery cost and to improve efficiency. However, the\ntraffic conditions in complex traffic environments, such as those in China, are\nmore challenging compared to those in well-developed countries. Many types of\nmoving objects (such as pedestrians, bicycles, electric bicycles, and\nmotorcycles, etc.) share the road with autonomous vehicles, and their behaviors\nare not easy to track and predict. This paper introduces a technical solution\nfrom JD.com, a leading E-commerce company in China, to the autonomous last-mile\ndelivery in complex traffic environments. Concretely, the methodologies in each\nmodule of our autonomous vehicles are presented, together with safety guarantee\nstrategies. Up to this point, JD.com has deployed more than 300 self-driving\nvehicles for trial operations in tens of provinces of China, with an\naccumulated 715,819 miles and up to millions of on-road testing hours.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jan 2020 16:00:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Mar 2020 13:16:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-26"}

The annuli consist of\ncircular cavities with a central circular obstruction. In the absence of the\ncentral obstruction cylinders of low aspect-ratio exhibit tetratic order,\nexcept for the existence of four defects which restore the symmetry broken by\nthe circular confinement. This behaviour is demanded by topology in systems\nwith strong anchoring properties at the surface. By contrast, topology dictates\nthat the annular geometry is compatible with a distorted tetratic phase without\npoint defects. However, the effect of restricted geometry and limited size on\nphases possessing finite anchoring energy at the wall and elastic stiffness\nleads to different configurations, showing finite ordered regions separated by\ndomain walls. We argue that highly packed nonequilibrium vibrated granular\nmonolayers respond to geometrical frustration and extreme confinement as\ncorresponding equilibrium systems of particles do, and that the former can be\nanalysed in terms of surface free energies, elastic distortions and defects,\nmuch as equilibrium liquid crystals. Therefore, selective confinement of\nvertically-vibrated monolayers of rods could be used with advantage as a new\ntool to study the creation and dynamics of various types of defects in ordered\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jan 2020 16:01:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-18"}

We render 2D views of an existing reconstruction and\ntrain a convolutional neural network (CNN) that refines inverse-depth to match\na higher-quality reconstruction. Since the views that we correct are rendered\nfrom the same reconstruction, they share the same geometry, so overlapping\nviews complement each other. We take advantage of that in two ways. Firstly, we\nimpose a loss during training which guides predictions on neighbouring views to\nhave the same geometry and has been shown to improve performance. Secondly, in\ncontrast to previous work, which corrects each view independently, we also make\npredictions on sets of neighbouring views jointly. This is achieved by warping\nfeature maps between views and thus bypassing memory-intensive 3D computation.\nWe make the observation that features in the feature maps are\nviewpoint-dependent, and propose a method for transforming features with\ndynamic filters generated by a multi-layer perceptron from the relative poses\nbetween views. In our experiments we show that this last step is necessary for\nsuccessfully fusing feature maps between views.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jan 2020 16:02:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-23"}

Although, useful for benchmarks and new\nidea comparison, the algorithmic dynamics does not always transfer to complex\nreal-life problems, where additional meta-data is required during solution\nconstruction. This paper looks at real-life outbound supply chain problem using\nAnt Colony Optimization (ACO) and its scaling dynamics with two parallel ACO\narchitectures - Independent Ant Colonies (IAC) and Parallel Ants (PA). Results\nshowed that PA was able to reach a higher solution quality in fewer iterations\nas the number of parallel instances increased. Furthermore, speed performance\nwas measured across three different hardware solutions - 16 core CPU, 68 core\nXeon Phi and up to 4 Geforce GPUs. State of the art, ACO vectorization\ntechniques such as SS-Roulette were implemented using C++ and CUDA. Although\nexcellent for TSP, it was concluded that for the given supply chain problem\nGPUs are not suitable due to meta-data access footprint required. Furthermore,\ncompared to their sequential counterpart, vectorized CPU AVX2 implementation\nachieved 25.4x speedup on CPU while Xeon Phi with its AVX512 instruction set\nreached 148x on PA with Vectorized (PAwV).

The liquid argon target allows exquisite discrimination\nbetween nuclear and electron recoil signals via pulse-shape discrimination of\nthe scintillation signals. Atmospheric argon (AAr), however, has a naturally\noccurring radioactive isotope, $^{39}$Ar, a $\\beta$ emitter of cosmogenic\norigin. For large detectors, the atmospheric $^{39}$Ar activity poses pile-up\nconcerns. The use of argon extracted from underground wells, deprived of\n$^{39}$Ar, is key to the physics potential of these experiments. The\nDarkSide-20k dark matter search experiment will operate a dual-phase time\nprojection chamber with 50 tonnes of radio-pure underground argon (UAr), that\nwas shown to be depleted of $^{39}$Ar with respect to AAr by a factor larger\nthan 1400. Assessing the $^{39}$Ar content of the UAr during extraction is\ncrucial for the success of DarkSide-20k, as well as for future experiments of\nthe Global Argon Dark Matter Collaboration (GADMC). This will be carried out by\nthe DArT in ArDM experiment, a small chamber made with extremely radio-pure\nmaterials that will be placed at the centre of the ArDM detector, in the\nCanfranc Underground Laboratory (LSC) in Spain. The ArDM LAr volume acts as an\nactive veto for background radioactivity, mostly $\\gamma$-rays from the ArDM\ndetector materials and the surrounding rock. This article describes the DArT in\nArDM project, including the chamber design and construction, and reviews the\nbackground required to achieve the expected performance of the detector.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jan 2020 16:10:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

This sensor does not offer\nenough information for us to progress in the core domain of HAR - to recognize\neveryday activities from sensor data. Despite continued and prolonged efforts\nin improving feature engineering and machine learning models, the activities\nthat we can recognize reliably have only expanded slightly and many of the same\nflaws of early models are still present today. Instead of relying on\nacceleration data, we should instead consider modalities with much richer\ninformation - a logical choice are images. With the rapid advance in image\nsensing hardware and modelling techniques, we believe that a widespread\nadoption of image sensors will open many opportunities for accurate and robust\ninference across a wide spectrum of human activities.\n  In this paper, we make the case for imagers in place of accelerometers as the\ndefault sensor for human activity recognition. Our review of past works has led\nto the observation that progress in HAR had stalled, caused by our reliance on\naccelerometers. We further argue for the suitability of images for activity\nrecognition by illustrating their richness of information and the marked\nprogress in computer vision. Through a feasibility analysis, we find that\ndeploying imagers and CNNs on device poses no substantial burden on modern\nmobile hardware. Overall, our work highlights the need to move away from\naccelerometers and calls for further exploration of using imagers for activity\nrecognition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jan 2020 16:12:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Jan 2020 10:51:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-31"}

This procedure consequently leads to the loss of the local\npseudoinvariance and the appearance of additional degrees of freedom (d.o.f.).\nThe constraint structure of f(T) gravity suggests the existence of one extra\nd.o.f. when compared with GR, which should describe some aspect of the\norientation of the tetrad. The purpose of this article is to better understand\nthe nature of this extra d.o.f. by means of a toy model that mimics essential\nfeatures of f(T) gravity. We find that the nonlinear modification of a\nLagrangian L possessing a local rotational pseudoinvariance produces two types\nof solutions. In one case the original gauge-invariant variables -- the\nanalogue of the metric in teleparallelism -- evolve like when governed by the\n(nondeformed) Lagrangian L; these solutions are characterized by a (selectable)\nconstant value of its Lagrangian, which is the manifestation of the extra\nd.o.f. In the other case, the solutions do contain new dynamics for the\noriginal gauge-invariant variables, but the extra d.o.f. does not materialize\nbecause the Lagrangian remains invariant on-shell. Coming back to f(T) gravity,\nthe first case includes solutions where the torsion scalar T is a constant, to\nbe chosen at the initial conditions (extra d.o.f.), and no new dynamics for the\nmetric is expected. The latter case covers those solutions displaying a genuine\nmodified gravity; T is not a constant, but it is (on-shell) invariant under\nLorentz transformations depending only on time. Both kinds of f(T) solutions\nare exemplified in a flat FLRW universe. Finally, we present a toy model for a\nhigher-order Lagrangian with rotational invariance [analogous to f(R) gravity]\nand derive its constraint structure and number of d.o.f.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jan 2020 16:34:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Apr 2020 15:36:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-27"}

Here we demonstrate how these Bragg peaks can be hidden in the\neffective diffraction pattern of independent and identically distributed\nperturbations. All Bragg peaks vanish if and only if the sum of all probability\ndensities of the positions of the shifted lattice points is a constant at all\npositions. The underlying long-range order is then 'cloaked' in the sense that\nit cannot be reconstructed from the pair correlation function alone. On the one\nhand, density fluctuations increase monotonically with the strength of\nperturbations $a$, as measured by the hyperuniformity order metric\n$\\overline{\\Lambda}$. On the other hand, the disappearance and reemergence of\nlong-range order, depending on whether the system is cloaked or not as the\nperturbation strength increases, is manifestly captured by the $\\tau$ order\nmetric.

A\nnumber of recent studies on brain development have examined functional\nconnectivity (FC) defined by the temporal correlation between time series of\ndifferent brain regions. We propose to add the directional flow of information\nduring brain maturation. To do so, we extract effective connectivity (EC)\nthrough Granger causality (GC) for two different groups of subjects, i.e.,\nchildren and young adults. The motivation is that the inclusion of causal\ninteraction may further discriminate brain connections between two age groups\nand help to discover new connections between brain regions. The contributions\nof this study are threefold. First, there has been a lack of attention to\nEC-based feature extraction in the context of brain development. To this end,\nwe propose a new kernel-based GC (KGC) method to learn nonlinearity of complex\nbrain network, where a reduced Sine hyperbolic polynomial (RSP) neural network\nwas used as our proposed learner. Second, we used causality values as the\nweight for the directional connectivity between brain regions. Our findings\nindicated that the strength of connections was significantly higher in young\nadults relative to children. In addition, our new EC-based feature outperformed\nFC-based analysis from Philadelphia neurocohort (PNC) study with better\ndiscrimination of the different age groups. Moreover, the fusion of these two\nsets of features (FC + EC) improved brain age prediction accuracy by more than\n4%, indicating that they should be used together for brain development studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jan 2020 17:38:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-29"}

The transition probability function of\nuPOMDPs is only known to belong to a so-called uncertainty set, for instance in\nthe form of probability intervals. Such a model arises when, for example, an\nagent operates under information limitation due to imperfect knowledge about\nthe accuracy of its sensors. The goal is to compute a policy for the agent that\nis robust against all possible probability distributions within the uncertainty\nset. In particular, we are interested in a policy that robustly ensures the\nsatisfaction of temporal logic and expected reward specifications. We state the\nunderlying optimization problem as a semi-infinite quadratically-constrained\nquadratic program (QCQP), which has finitely many variables and infinitely many\nconstraints. Since QCQPs are non-convex in general and practically infeasible\nto solve, we resort to the so-called convex-concave procedure to convexify the\nQCQP.

In ensembles of\ncoupled oscillators, explosive synchronization is a particular type of\ntransition to phase synchrony that is first-order as the coupling strength\nincreases. Explosive sychronization has been observed in several natural\nsystems, and recent evidence suggests that it might also occur in the brain. A\nnatural system to study this phenomenon is the Kuramoto model that describes an\nensemble of coupled phase oscillators. Here we calculate bi-variate similarity\nmeasures (the cross-correlation, $\\rho_{ij}$, and the phase locking value,\nPLV$_{ij}$) between the phases, $\\phi_i(t)$ and $\\phi_j(t)$, of pairs of\noscillators and determine the lag time between them as the time-shift,\n$\\tau_{ij}$, which gives maximum similarity (i.e., the maximum of\n$\\rho_{ij}(\\tau)$ or PLV$_{ij}(\\tau)$). We find that, as the transition to\nsynchrony is approached, changes in the distribution of lag times provide an\nearlier warning of the synchronization transition (either gradual or\nexplosive). The analysis of experimental data, recorded from Rossler-like\nelectronic chaotic oscillators, suggests that these findings are not limited to\nphase oscillators, as the lag times display qualitatively similar behavior with\nincreasing coupling strength, as in the Kuramoto oscillators. We also analyze\nthe statistical relationship between the lag times between pairs of oscillators\nand the existence of a direct connection between them.

However, guaranteeing safety for such learned deep policies\nhas been a challenge due to issues such as partial observability and\ndifficulties in characterizing the behavior of the neural networks. While a lot\nof emphasis in safe learning has been placed during training, it is non-trivial\nto guarantee safety at deployment or test time. This paper extends how under\nmild assumptions, Safety Barrier Certificates can be used to guarantee safety\nwith deep control policies despite uncertainty arising due to perception and\nother latent variables. Specifically for scenarios where the dynamics are\nsmooth and uncertainty has a finite support, the proposed framework wraps\naround an existing deep control policy and generates safe actions by\ndynamically evaluating and modifying the policy from the embedded network. Our\nframework utilizes control barrier functions to create spaces of control\nactions that are safe under uncertainty, and when the original actions are\nfound to be in violation of the safety constraint, uses quadratic programming\nto minimally modify the original actions to ensure they lie in the safe set.\nRepresentations of the environment are built through Euclidean signed distance\nfields that are then used to infer the safety of actions and to guarantee\nforward invariance. We implement this method in simulation in a drone-racing\nenvironment and show that our method results in safer actions compared to a\nbaseline that only relies on imitation learning to generate control actions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jan 2020 18:39:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 2020 16:21:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-03"}

The relationship between the two\nfractional terms can be readily obtained by applying the Laplace transform to a\ngiven equation. We seek to numerically approximate Caputo fractional integrals\nusing a Taylor series expansion for convolution integrals. This naturally\nextends into being able to approximate convolution integrals for a wider class\nof convolution integral kernels $K(t-s)$. One of the main advantages under this\napproach is the ability to numerically approximate weakly singular kernels,\nwhich fail to converge under traditional quadrature methods. We provide\nstability and convergence analysis for these composite quadratures, which offer\noptimal convergence for approximating functions in $C^{\\gamma}[0,T]$, where\n$\\alpha \\leq \\gamma \\leq 5$ and $0<\\alpha < 1$. For the order $\\gamma =\n1,2,3,4,5$ scheme, the resulting approximation is $O(\\tau^{\\gamma})$ accurate,\nwhere $\\tau$ is the size of the partition of the time domain. By instead\nutilizing a fractional Taylor series expansion, we are able to obtain for\n$\\gamma \\in (0,5)-\\{1,2,3,4\\}$ order scheme, which yields an approximation of\n$O(\\tau^{\\gamma})$ with a constant dependent on the kernel function which\nimproves the order of convergence. This allows for a far wider class of\nfunctions to be approximated, and by strengthening the regularity assumption,\nwe are able to obtain more accurate results. General convolution integrals\nexhibit these results up to $\\gamma = 2$ without the assumption of $K$ being\ndecreasing. Finally, some numerical examples are presented, which validate our\nfindings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jan 2020 18:52:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-23"}

We present and apply a method to correct the velocity amplitudes\nof the host stars for the presence of contaminating light. We determine the\nphysical properties of six systems (WASP-20, WASP-70, WASP-8, WASP-76, WASP-2\nand WASP-131) accounting for contaminating light. In the case of WASP-20 the\nmeasured physical properties are very different for the three scenarios\nconsidered (ignoring binarity, planet transits brighter star, and planet\ntransits fainter star). In the other five cases our results are very similar to\nthose obtained neglecting contaminating light. We use our results to determine\nthe mean correction factors to planet radius, $\\langle X_R\\rangle$, mass,\n$\\langle X_M\\rangle$, and density, $\\langle X_\\rho\\rangle$, caused by nearby\nobjects. We find $\\langle X_R\\rangle=1.009\\pm0.045$, which is smaller than\nliterature values because we were able to reject the possibility that the\nplanet orbits the fainter star in all but one case. We find $\\langle\nX_M\\rangle=1.031\\pm0.019$, which is larger than $\\langle X_R\\rangle$ because of\nthe strength of the effect of contaminating light on the radial velocity\nmeasurements of the host star. We find $\\langle X_\\rho\\rangle=0.995\\pm 0.046$:\nthe small size of this correction is due to two effects: the corrections on\nplanet radius and mass partially cancel; and some nearby stars are close enough\nto contaminate the light curves of the system but not radial velocities of the\nhost star. We conclude that binarity of planet host stars is important for the\nsmall number of transiting hot Jupiters with a very bright and close nearby\nstar, but it has only a small effect on population-level studies of these\nobjects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jan 2020 19:00:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Jan 2020 17:11:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-11"}

On the topic of electrostatics,\nfor example, a large, controlled, randomized study performed by Smith et al.\n2017\\cite{smith17}, found that VR-based instruction had an overall negligible\nimpact on student learning compared to videos or images. However, they did find\na strong trend for students who reported frequent video game play to learn\nbetter from VR than other media. One possible interpretation of this result is\nthat extended videogame play provides a kind of \"training\" that enables a\nstudent to learn more comfortably in the virtual environment. In the present\nwork we consider if a VR training activity that is unrelated to electrostatics\ncan help prepare students to learn electrostatics from subsequent VR\ninstruction. We find that preliminary VR training leads to a small but\nstatistically significant improvement in student performance on our\nelectrostatics assessment. We also find that student reported game play is\nstill correlated with higher scores on this metric.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jan 2020 20:14:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 15 Feb 2020 23:24:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 26 Apr 2020 20:42:03 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 1 Jul 2020 12:36:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-09"}

This is useful for segmentation and\ndenoising when data corresponding to images. We propose a novel Mixed Integer\nProgram (MIP) formulation for the piecewise affine fitting problem, where\nbinary variables determine the location of break-points. To obtain consistent\npartitions (i.e. image segmentation), we include multi-cut constraints in the\nformulation. Since the resulting problem is $\\mathcal{NP}$-hard, two techniques\nare introduced to improve the computation.

A major bottleneck on the\nperformance of distributed Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm for\nlarge-scale Federated Learning is the communication overhead on pushing local\ngradients and pulling global model. In this paper, to reduce the communication\ncomplexity of Federated Learning, a novel approach named Pulling Reduction with\nLocal Compensation (PRLC) is proposed. Specifically, each training node\nintermittently pulls the global model from the server in SGD iterations,\nresulting in that it is sometimes unsynchronized with the server. In such a\ncase, it will use its local update to compensate the gap between the local\nmodel and the global model. Our rigorous theoretical analysis of PRLC achieves\ntwo important findings. First, we prove that the convergence rate of PRLC\npreserves the same order as the classical synchronous SGD for both\nstrongly-convex and non-convex cases with good scalability due to the linear\nspeedup with respect to the number of training nodes. Second, we show that PRLC\nadmits lower pulling frequency than the existing pulling reduction method\nwithout local compensation. We also conduct extensive experiments on various\nmachine learning models to validate our theoretical results. Experimental\nresults show that our approach achieves a significant pulling reduction over\nthe state-of-the-art methods, e.g., PRLC requiring only half of the pulling\noperations of LAG.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jan 2020 20:53:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-24"}

A challenge is that among the large variety of data\ncollected at each client, it is likely that only a subset is relevant for a\nlearning task while the rest of data has a negative impact on model training.\nTherefore, before starting the learning process, it is important to select the\nsubset of data that is relevant to the given federated learning task.

The great majority\nof existing domain adaptation models rely on image translation networks, which\noften contain a huge amount of domain-specific parameters. Additionally, the\nfeature adaptation step often happens globally, at a coarse level, hindering\nits applicability to tasks such as semantic segmentation, where details are of\ncrucial importance to provide sharp results. In this thesis, we present a novel\narchitecture, which learns to adapt features across domains by taking into\naccount per class information. To that aim, we design a conditional pixel-wise\ndiscriminator network, whose output is conditioned on the segmentation masks.\nMoreover, following recent advances in image translation, we adopt the recently\nintroduced StarGAN architecture as image translation backbone, since it is able\nto perform translations across multiple domains by means of a single generator\nnetwork. Preliminary results on a segmentation task designed to assess the\neffectiveness of the proposed approach highlight the potential of the model,\nimproving upon strong baselines and alternative designs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jan 2020 23:51:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-24"}

We revisit the gas\nheating due to structure formation shocks in this era, using a set of fixed\ngrid cosmological hydrodynamical simulations performed by three different\ncodes. In all our simulations, the cosmic gas is predicted to be in multiphase\nstate since $z>30$.

These conclusions were based\non the calculations of dust polarized emission in the Rayleigh regime, i.e. for\ngrain sizes much smaller than the wavelength. However, the grain size in such\ndisks is estimated to be typically in the range 0.1 - 1 mm from independent\nobservations. We study the dust polarization properties of aligned grains in\nemission in the Mie regime, i.e. when the mean grain size approches the\nwavelength. Using the T-MATRIX and DustEM codes, we compute the spectral\ndependence of the polarization fraction in emission for grains in perfect\nspinning alignment, for various grain size distributions of weakly-elongated\noblate and prolate grains of astrosilicate composition, with a mean size\nranging from 10 {\\mu}m to 1 mm. In the submillimeter and millimeter wavelength\nrange, the polarization by B-field aligned grains becomes negative for grains\nlarger than ~ 250 {\\mu}m, meaning that the polarization vector becomes parallel\nto the B-field. The transition from the positive to the negative polarization\noccurs at a wavelength {\\lambda} ~ 1 mm. The regime of negative polarization\ndoes not exist for grains smaller than ~ 100 {\\mu}m. When using realistic grain\nsize distributions for disks with grains up to the submillimeter sizes, the\npolarization direction of thermal emission by aligned grains is shown to be\nparallel to the direction of the magnetic field over a significant fraction of\nthe wavelengths typically used to observe young protoplanetary disks.

The neutron scattering data show the turn of magnetization\nvector of the heterostructure (mainly manganite) on 26 degree closer to the\nexternal field with reducing temperature down to 10K. Additional ferromagnetic\nstate appearing at T<100K indicate on emergence of ferromagnetism in the thin\n(10 nm) paramagnetic SIO film close to the interface. We have measured the dc\nvoltage aroused on the SIO film caused by spin pumping and the anisotropic\nmagnetoresistance in the heterostructure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jan 2020 08:14:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-07"}

Therefore, cluster structure implanted with edge structure, vertex\nfeatures, neighboring preferences, and vertex-vertex dichotomous inclinations\ncan be learned by RTCMPN.

A common property of graphs used in the\ndomain of graph analytics is a power-law distribution of vertex connectivity,\nwherein a small number of vertices are responsible for a high fraction of all\nconnections in the graph. These richly-connected (hot) vertices inherently\nexhibit high reuse. However, their sparse distribution in memory leads to a\nsevere underutilization of on-chip cache capacity. Prior works have proposed\nlightweight skew-aware vertex reordering that places hot vertices adjacent to\neach other in memory, reducing the cache footprint of hot vertices. However, in\ndoing so, they may inadvertently destroy the inherent community structure\nwithin the graph, which may negate the performance gains achieved from the\nreduced footprint of hot vertices.\n  In this work, we study existing reordering techniques and demonstrate the\ninherent tension between reducing the cache footprint of hot vertices and\npreserving original graph structure. We quantify the potential performance loss\ndue to disruption in graph structure for different graph datasets. We further\nshow that reordering techniques that employ fine-grain reordering significantly\nincrease misses in the higher level caches, even when they reduce misses in the\nlast-level cache.\n  To overcome the limitations of existing reordering techniques, we propose\nDegree-Based Grouping (DBG), a novel lightweight reordering technique that\nemploys a coarse-grain reordering to largely preserve graph structure while\nreducing the cache footprint of hot vertices.

Under such circumstances, it is very\nessential to infer whether each claim (e.g., news, messages) is a truth or a\nrumor, and identify their \\emph{sources}, i.e., the users who initially spread\nthose claims. While most prior arts have been dedicated to the two tasks\nrespectively, this paper aims to offer the joint inference on truth/rumor and\ntheir sources. Our insight is that a joint inference can enhance the mutual\nperformance on both sides.\n  To this end, we propose a framework named SourceCR, which alternates between\ntwo modules, i.e., \\emph{credibility-reliability training} for truth/rumor\ninference and \\emph{division-querying} for source detection, in an iterative\nmanner. To elaborate, the former module performs a simultaneous estimation of\nclaim credibility and user reliability by virtue of an Expectation Maximization\nalgorithm, which takes the source reliability outputted from the latter module\nas the initial input. Meanwhile, the latter module divides the network into two\ndifferent subnetworks labeled via the claim credibility, and in each subnetwork\nlaunches source detection by applying querying of theoretical budget guarantee\nto the users selected via the estimated reliability from the former module. The\nproposed SourceCR is provably convergent, and algorithmic implementable with\nreasonable computational complexity. We empirically validate the effectiveness\nof the proposed framework in both synthetic and real datasets, where the joint\ninference leads to an up to 35\\% accuracy of credibility gain and 29\\% source\ndetection rate gain compared with the separate counterparts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jan 2020 12:29:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-24"}

Some of the most prominent sources for particle acceleration in our\nSolar System are large eruptions of magnetised plasma from the Sun called\ncoronal mass ejections (CMEs). These accelerated particles can generate radio\nemission through various mechanisms. Aims. CMEs are often accompanied by a\nvariety of solar radio bursts with different shapes and characteristics in\ndynamic spectra. Radio bursts directly associated with CMEs often show movement\nin the direction of CME expansion. Here, we aim to determine the emission\nmechanism of multiple moving radio bursts that accompanied a flare and CME that\ntook place on 14 June 2012. Methods. We used radio imaging from the Nancay\nRadioheliograph, combined with observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory\nand Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory spacecraft, to analyse these moving\nradio bursts in order to determine their emission mechanism and\nthree-dimensional (3D) location with respect to the expanding CME. Results. In\nusing a 3D representation of the particle acceleration locations in relation to\nthe overlying coronal magnetic field and the CME propagation, for the first\ntime, we provide evidence that these moving radio bursts originate near the CME\nflanks and some that are possible signatures of shock-accelerated electrons\nfollowing the fast CME expansion in the low corona. Conclusions. The moving\nradio bursts, as well as other stationary bursts observed during the eruption,\noccur simultaneously with a type IV continuum in dynamic spectra, which is not\nusually associated with emission at the CME flanks. Our results show that\nmoving radio bursts that could traditionally be classified as moving type IVs\ncan represent shock signatures associated with CME flanks or plasma emission\ninside the CME behind its flanks, which are closely related to the lateral\nexpansion of the CME in the low corona.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jan 2020 12:39:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-11"}

In the first part of the work, by solving\nanalytically the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model in a field close to its critical\npoint, we show that even in a paramagnetic phase the forcing of two real\nreplicas to an overlap small enough leads the model to a phase transition where\nthe symmetry between replicas is spontaneously broken. More importantly, this\nphase transition is related to the de Almeida-Thouless (dAT) critical line. In\nthe second part of the work, we exploit the phase transition in the overlap\nbetween two real replicas to identify the critical line in a field in\nfinite-dimensional spin glasses. This is a notoriously difficult computational\nproblem, because of huge finite-size corrections.

In amorphous solids for\nexample, the athermal response to shear is due to localized plastic events\n(soft spots). As shown recently by one of us, the plastic response to applied\nshear can be rigorously described in terms of a directed network whose\ntransitions correspond to one or more soft spots changing states. The topology\nof this graph depends on the interactions between soft-spots and when such\ninteractions are negligible, the resulting description becomes that of the\nPreisach model. A first step in linking transition graph topology with the\nunderlying soft-spot interactions is therefore to determine the structure of\nsuch graphs in the absence of interactions. Here we perform a detailed analysis\nof the transition graph of the Preisach model. We highlight the important role\nplayed by return point memory in organizing the graph into a hierarchy of loops\nand sub-loops. Our analysis reveals that the topology of a large portion of\nthis graph is actually not governed by the values of the switching fields that\ndescribe the individual hysteretic behavior of the individual elements, but by\na coarser parameter, a permutation $\\rho$ which prescribes the sequence in\nwhich the individual hysteretic elements change their states as the main\nhysteresis loop is traversed. This in turn allows us to derive combinatorial\nproperties, such as the number of major loops in the transition graph as well\nas the number of states $| \\mathcal{R} |$ constituting the main hysteresis loop\nand its nested subloops.

We further propose a circuit quantum\nelectrodynamics realization of the proposed physics, in which the required\nnon-Abelian gauge field can be synthesized by the parametric conversion method,\nand the non-Abelian AB caging can be unambiguously demonstrated through the\npumping and the steady-state measurements of only a few sites on the lattice.\nRequiring only currently available technique, our proposal can be readily\ntested in experiment and may pave a new route towards the investigation of\nexotic photonic quantum fluids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jan 2020 14:27:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 2020 08:19:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

We argue\nthat a more robust connection between the initial-state sources with\nfinal-state multiplicity could be established from the event-by-event\nmultiplicity correlation between two subevents separated in pseudorapidity,\n$N_a$ vs $N_b$. This correlation is sensitive to two main types of centrality\nfluctuations (CF): 1) particle production for each source $p(n)$ which smears\nthe relation between $V$ and $N_a$ used for experimental centrality, and 2)\ndecorrelations between the sources in the two subevents $V_b$ and $V_a$. The CF\nis analyzed in terms of cumulants of $V_b$ and $N_b$ as a function of $N_a$,\ni.e. experimental centrality is defined with $N_a$. We found that the mean\nvalues $\\langle V_b\\rangle_{N_a}$ and $\\langle N_b\\rangle_{N_a}$ increase\nlinearly with $N_a$ in mid-central collisions, but flatten out in ultra-central\ncollisions.

Due to the fact that the former works well in the low SNR region\nbut becomes worse in the medium and high SNR regions while the latter also has\nthe similar problem, a novel RAS strategy Max-SR-A is proposed to cover all SNR\nregions. Simulation results show that the proposed Max-SR-H and Max-SR-L\nschemes approach the optimal SR performances of the exhaustive search (ES) in\nthe high and low SNR regions, respectively. In particular, the SR performance\nof the proposed Max-SR-A is close to that of the optimal ES and better than\nthat of the random method in almost all SNR regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jan 2020 15:46:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-24"}

All these networks take the mixed utterance of\ntwo speakers and map it to two separate utterances, where each utterance\ncontains only one speaker's voice.

Technically, we\npropose an efficient and effective CNN framework, i.e., Fast Dense Residual\nNetwork (FDRN), for text recognition.

After fully learning local residual dense features, we\nutilize the sum operation and several f-RDBs to define a new block termed\nglobal dense block (GDB) by imitating the construction of dense blocks to learn\nglobal dense residual features adaptively in a holistic way.

A common property of graphs used in the\ndomain of graph analytics is a power-law distribution of vertex connectivity,\nwherein a small number of vertices are responsible for a high fraction of all\nconnections in the graph. These richly-connected, hot, vertices inherently\nexhibit high reuse. However, this work finds that state-of-the-art hardware\ncache management schemes struggle in capitalizing on their reuse due to highly\nirregular access patterns of graph analytics.\n  In response, we propose GRASP, domain-specialized cache management at the\nlast-level cache for graph analytics.

This paper proposes a new\ntwo-stage framework for surrogate-aided reliability analysis named Surrogates\nfor Importance Sampling (S4IS). In the first stage, a coarse surrogate is built\nto gain the information about failure regions; the second stage zooms into the\nimportant regions and improves the accuracy of the failure probability\nestimator by adaptively selecting support points therein. The learning\nfunctions are proposed to guide the selection of support points such that the\nexploration and exploitation can be dynamically balanced. As a generic\nframework, S4IS has the potential to incorporate different types of surrogates\n(Gaussian Processes, Support Vector Machines, Neural Network, etc.). The\neffectiveness and efficiency of S4IS is validated by five illustrative\nexamples, which involve system reliability, highly nonlinear limit-state\nfunction, small failure probability and moderately high dimensionality.
