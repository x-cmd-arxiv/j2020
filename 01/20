We restrict ourselves to K-essence kinetic\nterms where the shift symmetric part of the Lagrangian is a function of the\nfirst derivatives of the scalar field only. In the low-amplitude and\nnonrelativistic regime, which applies on large galactic scales, scalar clouds\nform solitons with a finite core. Close to the center of galaxies, where a\nsupermassive Black Hole (BH) resides, we analyze the scalar field distribution\nand the fate of the dark matter soliton when subject to the BH gravitational\nattraction. We show that the scalar field profile around such a central BH can\nbe described by new oscillatory solutions of a modified Klein-Gordon equation,\nwhich generalize the harmonic oscillations of free scalar dark matter in a flat\nenvironment and the Jacobi elliptic functions of the $\\phi^4$ model. Moreover,\nwe find that, depending on the form of the K-essence kinetic term, regular\nsolutions can be constructed or not, which connect the relativistic ingoing\nwavelike profile of the scalar field at the BH horizon to the nearly static\nnonrelativistic soliton at large distance.

These merits have made them very\npopular in mobile robotics and AR, where it is of great interest to estimate\nego-motion and 3D scene structure. Such spatial understanding can enable robots\nto navigate autonomously without collisions and allow users to insert virtual\nentities consistent with the image stream. In this chapter, we review common\nformulations of odometry and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (known by\nits acronym SLAM) using RGB-D stream input. The two topics are closely related,\nas the former aims to track the incremental camera motion with respect to a\nlocal map of the scene, and the latter to jointly estimate the camera\ntrajectory and the global map with consistency.

An alternative technique is time-domain Full-Field Optical\nCoherence Tomography (FF-OCT), which has already shown its potential for\nin-vivo high-resolution retinal imaging.

Suturing is one of the most\ncomplex tasks performed under these circumstances. Key components of this tasks\nare the interplay between needle holder and the surgical needle. Reliable 3D\nlocalization of needle and instruments in real time could be used to augment\nthe scene with additional parameters that describe their quantitative geometric\nrelation, e.g. the relation between the estimated needle plane and its rotation\ncenter and the instrument.

One such\nmaterial is sputter-deposited B20 FeGe on Si, which has been actively\ninvestigated as the basis for low-power, high-density magnetic memory\ntechnology in a scalable material platform. Although conventional Lorentz\nelectron microscopy provides the requisite spatial resolution to probe chiral\nmagnetic textures in single-crystal FeGe, probing the magnetism of sputtered\nB20 FeGe is more challenging because the sub-micron crystal grains add\nconfounding contrast. We address the challenge of disentangling magnetic and\ngrain contrast by applying 4-dimensional Lorentz scanning transmission electron\nmicroscopy using an electron microscope pixel array detector. Supported by\nanalytical and numerical models, we find that the most important parameter for\nimaging magnetic materials with polycrystalline grains is the ability for the\ndetector to sustain large electron doses, where having a high-dynamic range\ndetector becomes extremely important. Despite the small grain size in sputtered\nB20 FeGe on Si, using this approach we are still able to observe helicity\nswitching of skyrmions and magnetic helices across two adjacent grains as they\nthread through neighboring grains. We reproduce this effect using micromagnetic\nsimulations by assuming that the grains have distinct orientation and magnetic\nchirality and find that magnetic helicity couples to crystal chirality.

In particular, we verify the\nexistence of correlations among different types of crime from temporal and\nspatial perspectives, and propose a coherent framework to mathematically model\nthese correlations for crime prediction. The extensive experimental results on\nreal-world data validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Further\nexperiments have been conducted to understand the importance of different\ncorrelations in crime prediction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jan 2020 00:34:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Jan 2020 02:20:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-23"}

Stereotypically\nELP is associated with two separated sets of flaring loops with distinct sizes,\nand it has been debated whether ELP is caused by additional heating or extended\nplasma cooling in the longer loop system. Here we carry out a survey of 55\nM-and-above GOES-class flares with ELP during 2010--2014. Based on the\nflare-ribbon morphology, these flares are categorized as circular-ribbon (19\nevents), two-ribbon (23 events), and complex-ribbon (13 events) flares. Among\nthem, 22 events (40%) are associated with coronal mass ejections, while the\nrest are confined. An extreme ELP, with the late-phase peak exceeding the\nmain-phase peak, is found in 48% of two-ribbon flares, 37% of circular-ribbon\nflares, and 31% of complex-ribbon flares, suggesting that additional heating is\nmore likely present during ELP in two-ribbon than in circular-ribbon flares.\nOverall, cooling may be the dominant factor causing the delay of the ELP peak\nrelative to the main-phase peak, because the loop system responsible for the\nELP emission is generally larger than, and well separated from, that\nresponsible for the main-phase emission. All but one of the circular-ribbon\nflares can be well explained by a composite \"dome-plate\" quasi-separatrix layer\n(QSL). Only half of these show a magnetic null point, with its fan and spine\nembedded in the dome and plate, respectively. The dome-plate QSL, therefore, is\na general and robust structure characterizing circular-ribbon flares.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jan 2020 01:05:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-13"}

As the end of Moore's law seems to be imminent,\nemerging technologies that enable high performance neuromorphic hardware\nsystems are attracting increasing attention. Namely, neuromorphic architectures\nthat leverage memristors, the programmable and nonvolatile two-terminal\ndevices, as synaptic weights in hardware neural networks, are candidates of\nchoice to realize such highly energy-efficient and complex nervous systems.\nHowever, one of the challenges for memristive hardware with integrated learning\ncapabilities is prohibitively large number of write cycles that might be\nrequired during learning process, and this situation is even exacerbated under\nRL situations. In this work we propose a memristive neuromorphic hardware\nimplementation for the actor-critic algorithm in RL.

A bar-and-joint framework is a\npair $(G,p)$ of graph $G$ together with a map $p$ of the vertices of $G$ into\nthe Euclidean plane. We view the edges of $(G, p)$ as bars and the vertices as\nuniversal joints. The vertices can move continuously as long as the distances\nbetween pairs of adjacent vertices are preserved. The framework is rigid if any\nsuch motion preserves the distances between all pairs of vertices. In 1970,\nLaman obtained a combinatorial characterization of rigid graphs in the\nEuclidean plane.

Recently, a novel notion of \"dense\" (\"sparse\")\ntree, and in particular spanning tree (DST and SST respectively), is introduced\nas the structure that have a large (small) number of subtrees, or small (large)\nsum of distances between vertices. We show that finding DST and SST reduces to\nsolving the discrete optimization problems. New and efficient approaches to\nfind such spanning trees is achieved by imposing certain conditions on the\nvertex degrees which are then used to define an objective function that is\nminimized over all spanning trees of the graph under consideration. Solving\nthis minimization problem exactly may be prohibitively time consuming for large\ngraphs. Hence, we propose to use genetic algorithm (GA) which is one of well\nknown metaheuristics methods to solve DST and SST approximately.

We also\ndemonstrate on a number of applications that GA approach is well suited for\nthese types of problems both in computational efficiency and accuracy of the\napproximate solution.

In weak annotating, most of the manual\nannotations are supposed to be correct yet inevitably mixed with incorrect\nones. The WA data can be naturally obtained in an interactive way for specific\ntasks, for example, in the case of homography estimation, one can easily\nannotate points on the same plane/object with a single label by observing the\nimage. Motivated by this, we propose a novel method to make full use of the WA\ndata to boost the multi-model fitting performance. Specifically, a graph for\nmodel proposal sampling is first constructed using the WA data, given the prior\nthat the WA data annotated with the same weak label has a high probability of\nbeing assigned to the same model. By incorporating this prior knowledge into\nthe calculation of edge probabilities, vertices (i.e., data points) lie on/near\nthe latent model are likely to connect together and further form a\nsubset/cluster for effective proposals generation. With the proposals\ngenerated, the $\\alpha$-expansion is adopted for labeling, and our method in\nreturn updates the proposals. This works in an iterative way.

A recently developed characteristic-Galerkin finite-element code,\nFINMHD, that is specifically designed for this aim in a reduced visco-resistive\nMHD framework, is employed. Contrary to previous studies, a different initial\nsetup of two repelling current channels is chosen in order to form two\nquasi-singular current layers on an Alfv\\'enic time scale as a consequence of\nthe tilt instability. If $S < 5 \\times 10^3$, a subsequent stationary\nreconnection process is obtained with a rate scaling as $S^{-1/2}$ as predicted\nby the classical Sweet-Parker model. Otherwise, a stochastic time-dependent\nreconnection regime occurs, with a fast time-averaged rate independent of $S$\nand having a normalized value of $0.014$.

The galaxies are initially composed of a spherical\ndark matter halo and only stellar, or stellar and gaseous, disks with\nparameters that are similar to the Milky Way and are evolved for 10 Gyr. We\nconsider different values of the gas fraction $f =0-0.3$ and in order to\nisolate the effect of the gas, we kept the fraction constant during the\nevolution by not allowing the gas to cool and form stars. The stellar bars that\nform in simulations with higher gas fractions are weaker and shorter, and they\ndo not form at all for gas fractions that are higher than 0.3. The bar with a\ngas fraction of 0.1 forms sooner due to initial perturbations in the gas, but\ndespite the longer evolution, it does not become stronger than the one in the\ncollisionless case at the end of evolution. The bars in the gas component are\nweaker; they reach their maximum strength around 4 Gyr and later decline to\ntransform into spheroidal shapes. The distortion of the stellar bar during the\nbuckling instability is weaker for higher gas fractions and weakens the bar\nless significantly, but it has a similar structure both in terms of radial\nprofiles and in face-on projections. For $f=0.2,$ the first buckling lasts\nsignificantly longer and the bar does not undergo the secondary buckling event,\nwhile for $f=0.3,$ the buckling does not occur.

The MNL model serves as the workhorse model for\na variety of fields, but is also widely criticized, with a large body of\nexperimental literature claiming to document real-world settings where IIA\nfails to hold. Statistical tests of IIA as a modelling assumption have been the\nsubject of many practical tests focusing on specific deviations from IIA over\nthe past several decades, but the formal size properties of hypothesis testing\nIIA are still not well understood. In this work we replace some of the\nambiguity in this literature with rigorous pessimism, demonstrating that any\ngeneral test for IIA with low worst-case error would require a number of\nsamples exponential in the number of alternatives of the choice problem. A\nmajor benefit of our analysis over previous work is that it lies entirely in\nthe finite-sample domain, a feature crucial to understanding the behavior of\ntests in the common data-poor settings of discrete choice. Our lower bounds are\nstructure-dependent, and as a potential cause for optimism, we find that if one\nrestricts the test of IIA to violations that can occur in a specific collection\nof choice sets (e.g., pairs), one obtains structure-dependent lower bounds that\nare much less pessimistic. Our analysis of this testing problem is unorthodox\nin being highly combinatorial, counting Eulerian orientations of cycle\ndecompositions of a particular bipartite graph constructed from a data set of\nchoices. By identifying fundamental relationships between the comparison\nstructure of a given testing problem and its sample efficiency, we hope these\nrelationships will help lay the groundwork for a rigorous rethinking of the IIA\ntesting problem as well as other testing problems in discrete choice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jan 2020 10:15:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-22"}

Unfortunately, implementing accelerator VM efficiently\nis challenging because the area and power constraints make it difficult to\nemploy the large multi-level TLBs used in general-purpose CPUs. Recent research\nproposals advocate a number of restrictions on virtual-to-physical address\nmappings in order to reduce the TLB size or increase its reach. However, such\nrestrictions are unattractive because they forgo many of the original benefits\nof traditional VM, such as demand paging and copy-on-write.\n  We propose SPARTA, a divide and conquer approach to address translation.\nSPARTA splits the address translation into accelerator-side and memory-side\nparts. The accelerator-side translation hardware consists of a tiny TLB\ncovering only the accelerator's cache hierarchy (if any), while the translation\nfor main memory accesses is performed by shared memory-side TLBs. Performing\nthe translation for memory accesses on the memory side allows SPARTA to overlap\ndata fetch with translation, and avoids the replication of TLB entries for data\nshared among accelerators. To further improve the performance and efficiency of\nthe memory-side translation, SPARTA logically partitions the memory space,\ndelegating translation to small and efficient per-partition translation\nhardware. Our evaluation on index-traversal accelerators shows that SPARTA\nvirtually eliminates translation overhead, reducing it by over 30x on average\n(up to 47x) and improving performance by 57%. At the same time, SPARTA requires\nminimal accelerator-side translation hardware, reduces the total number of TLB\nentries in the system, gracefully scales with memory size, and preserves all\nkey VM functionalities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jan 2020 10:23:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-22"}

Our analysis shows\nthe differential rotation with respect to latitude as well as temperature (or,\nheight). In the present study, we find that the sidereal rotation periods of\ndifferent coronal layers decrease with increasing temperature (or, height).\nAverage sidereal rotation period at the lowest temperature (~ 600000 Kelvin)\ncorresponding to AIA-171 {\\AA} which originates from the upper transition\nregion/quiet corona is 27.03 days. The sidereal rotation period decreases with\ntemperature (or, height) to 25.47 days at the higher temperature (~10 million\nKelvin) corresponding to the flaring regions of solar corona as seen in AIA-131\n{\\AA} observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jan 2020 10:26:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-19"}

Recently, [HZ19] obtained a pointwise limit\ndistribution theory for the so-called block max-min and min-max estimators\n[FLN17] in this model, but inference remains a difficult problem due to the\nnuisance parameter in the limit distribution that involves multiple unknown\npartial derivatives of the true regression function.\n  In this paper, we show that this difficult nuisance parameter can be\neffectively eliminated by taking advantage of information beyond point\nestimates in the block max-min and min-max estimators. Formally, let\n$\\hat{u}(x_0)$ (resp. $\\hat{v}(x_0)$) be the maximizing lower-left (resp.\nminimizing upper-right) vertex in the block max-min (resp. min-max) estimator,\nand $\\hat{f}_n$ be the average of the block max-min and min-max estimators.

However, without learning models for PF, these methods cannot\nexamine whether a new provided point locates on PF or not. In this paper, we\nreconsider the task from Data Mining perspective. A novel projection based\nactive Gaussian process regression (P- aGPR) method is proposed for efficient\nPF modeling. First, P- aGPR chooses a series of projection spaces with\ndimensionalities ranking from low to high. Next, in each projection space, a\nGaussian process regression (GPR) model is trained to represent the constraint\nthat PF should satisfy in that space. Moreover, in order to improve modeling\nefficacy and stability, an active learning framework has been developed by\nexploiting the uncertainty information obtained in the GPR models. Different\nfrom all existing methods, our proposed P-aGPR method can not only provide a\ngenerative PF model, but also fast examine whether a provided point locates on\nPF or not. The numerical results demonstrate that compared to state-of-the-art\npassive learning methods the proposed P-aGPR method can achieve higher modeling\naccuracy and stability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jan 2020 11:52:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-22"}

GR is formulated in generalized reference\nframes, which are represented by (anholonomic in general case) affine frame\nfields. The general principle of relativity is extended to the requirement of\ninvariance of the theory with respect to transitions between generalized\nreference frames, that is, with respect to the group $GL^g$ of local linear\ntransformations of affine frame fields. GR is interpreted as the gauge theory\nof the gauge group of translations $T^g_M$, and therefore is invariant under\nthe space-time diffeomorphisms. The groups $GL^g$ and $T^g_M$ are united into\ngroup $S^g_M$, which is their semidirect product and is the complete symmetry\ngroup of the general relativity in an affine frame (GRAF).\n  The consequence of $GL^g$-invariance of GRAF is the Palatini equation, which\nin the absence of torsion goes into the metricity condition, and vice versa,\nthat is, is fulfilled identically in the Riemannian space. The consequence of\nthe $T^g_M$-invariance of GRAF is representation of the Einstein equation in\nthe superpotential form, that is, in the form of dynamic Maxwell equations (or\nYoung-Mills equations).

In edge partitioning, the edge set of a given graph is split into\n$k$ equally-sized partitions, such that the replication of vertices across\npartitions is minimized. Streaming is a viable approach to partition graphs\nthat exceed the memory capacities of a single server. The graph is ingested as\na stream of edges, and one edge at a time is immediately and irrevocably\nassigned to a partition based on a scoring function. However, streaming\npartitioning suffers from the uninformed assignment problem: At the time of\npartitioning early edges in the stream, there is no information available about\nthe rest of the edges. As a consequence, edge assignments are often driven by\nbalancing considerations, and the achieved replication factor is comparably\nhigh. In this paper, we propose 2PS, a novel two-phase streaming algorithm for\nhigh-quality edge partitioning. In the first phase, vertices are separated into\nclusters by a lightweight streaming clustering algorithm. In the second phase,\nthe graph is re-streamed and edge partitioning is performed while taking into\naccount the clustering of the vertices from the first phase. Our evaluations\nshow that 2PS can achieve a replication factor that is comparable to\nheavy-weight random access partitioners while inducing orders of magnitude\nlower memory overhead.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jan 2020 12:52:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-22"}

However, many of these blockchain systems suffer from serious\nshortcomings related to their performance and security, which need to be\naddressed before any wide-scale adoption can be achieved. A crucial component\nof any blockchain system is its underlying consensus algorithm, which in many\nways, determines its performance and security. Therefore, to address the\nlimitations of different blockchain systems, several existing as well novel\nconsensus algorithms have been introduced. A systematic analysis of these\nalgorithms will help to understand how and why any particular blockchain\nperforms the way it functions. However, the existing studies of consensus\nalgorithms are not comprehensive. Those studies have incomplete discussions on\nthe properties of the algorithms and fail to analyse several major blockchain\nconsensus algorithms in terms of their scopes.

To address these\nissues, we propose a hybrid interpretable model that combines a piecewise\nlinear component and a nonlinear component.

A lot of efforts have been\ndevoted to calculating graphlet statistics where random walk based approaches\nare commonly used to access restricted graphs through the available application\nprogramming interfaces (APIs). However, most of them merely consider individual\nnetworks while overlooking the strong coupling between different networks. In\nthis paper, we estimate the graphlet concentration in multi-layer networks with\nreal-world applications. An inter-layer edge connects two nodes in different\nlayers if they belong to the same person. The access to a multi-layer network\nis restrictive in the sense that the upper layer allows random walk sampling,\nwhereas the nodes of lower layers can be accessed only though the inter-layer\nedges and only support random node or edge sampling. To cope with this new\nchallenge, we define a suit of two-layer graphlets and propose a novel random\nwalk sampling algorithm to estimate the proportion of all the 3-node graphlets.\nAn analytical bound on the sampling steps is proved to guarantee the\nconvergence of our unbiased estimator.

In contrast, interventional\ndirect and indirect effects for multiple mediators (Vansteelandt and Daniel,\n2017) can be identified under much weaker conditions, while providing\nscientifically relevant causal interpretations. Nonetheless, current estimation\napproaches require (correctly) specifying a model for the joint mediator\ndistribution, which can be difficult when there is a high-dimensional set of\npossibly continuous and non-continuous mediators.

Molecular gas is\nalways found in small gas discs in the central region of the galaxy, while\nneutral hydrogen is often distributed in a low-column density disc or ring\ntypically extending well beyond the stellar body. Dust is frequently found in\nETGs as well. The goal of our study is to understand the link between dust and\ncold gas in nearby ETGs as a function of HI content. We analyse deep optical\n$g-r$ images obtained with the MegaCam camera at the Canada-France-Hawaii\nTelescope for a sample of 21 HI-rich and 41 HI-poor ETGs. We find that all\nHI-rich galaxies contain dust seen as absorption. Moreover, in 57 percent of\nthese HI-rich galaxies, the dust is distributed in a large-scale spiral\npattern. Although the dust detection rate is relatively high in the HI-poor\ngalaxies ($\\sim$59 percent), most of these systems exhibit simpler dust\nmorphologies without any evidence of spiral structures. We find that the\nHI-rich galaxies possess more complex dust morphology extending to almost two\ntimes larger radii than HI-poor objects. We measured the dust content of the\ngalaxies from the optical colour excess and find that HI-rich galaxies contain\nsix times more dust (in mass) than HI-poor ones. In order to maintain the dust\nstructures in the galaxies, continuous gas accretion is needed, and the\nsubstantial HI gas reservoirs in the outer regions of ETGs can satisfy this\nneed for a long time. We find that there is a good correspondence between the\nobserved masses of the gas and dust, and it is also clear that dust is present\nin regions further than 3~Reff. Our findings indicate an essential relation\nbetween the presence of cold gas and dust in ETGs and offer a way to study the\ninterstellar medium in more detail than what is possible with HI observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Jan 2020 16:10:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-08"}

In this work, we propose\nto separate the task of shock detection and shock capturing more strongly and\naim to develop a shock indicator that is robust, accurate, requires minimal\nuser input and is suitable for high order element-based methods like\ndiscontinuous Galerkin and flux reconstruction methods. The novel indicator is\nlearned from analytical data through a supervised learning strategy; its input\nis given by the high order solution field, its output is an element-local map\nof the shock position. We use state of the art methods from edge detection in\nimage analysis based on deep convolutional multiscale networks and deep\nsupervision to train the indicators. The resulting networks are then used as\nblack box indicators, showing their robustness and accuracy on well established\ncanonical testcases. All simulations are run ab initio using the developed\nindicators, showing that they provide also stability during the strongly\ntransient phases. In particular for high order schemes with large cells and\nconsiderable inner-cell resolution capabilities, we demonstrate how the\nadditional accurate prediction of the position of the shock front can be\nexploited to guide inner-element shock capturing strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jan 2020 10:37:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-28"}

In this paper, machine learning is\nused to develop a data-driven model for the secondary Bjerknes force between\ntwo insonated bubbles as a function of the equilibrium radii of the bubbles,\nthe distance between the bubbles, the amplitude and the frequency of the\npressure. The force varies over several orders of magnitude, which poses a\nserious challenge for the usual machine learning models. To overcome this\ndifficulty, the magnitudes and the signs of the force are separated and\nmodelled separately. A nonlinear regression is obtained with a feed-forward\nnetwork model for the logarithm of the magnitude, whereas the sign is modelled\nby a support-vector machine model. The principle, the practical aspects related\nto the training and validation of the machine models are introduced. The\npredictions from the models are checked against the values computed from the\nKeller-Miksis equations.

However, large-scale networks bring computational\nchallenges to the eigenvalue decomposition therein. In this paper, we study the\nspectral clustering using randomized sketching algorithms from a statistical\nperspective, where we typically assume the network data are generated from a\nstochastic block model that is not necessarily of full rank. To do this, we\nfirst use the recently developed sketching algorithms to obtain two randomized\nspectral clustering algorithms, namely, the random projection-based and the\nrandom sampling-based spectral clustering. Then we study the theoretical bounds\nof the resulting algorithms in terms of the approximation error for the\npopulation adjacency matrix, the misclassification error, and the estimation\nerror for the link probability matrix. It turns out that, under mild\nconditions, the randomized spectral clustering algorithms lead to the same\ntheoretical bounds as those of the original spectral clustering algorithm. We\nalso extend the results to degree-corrected stochastic block models. Numerical\nexperiments support our theoretical findings and show the efficiency of\nrandomized methods.

Therefore, it is very necessary to develop reliable, active\nand contemporary methods of phishing detection to combat the adaptive\ntechniques used by phishers. In this paper, different phishing detection\napproaches are reviewed by classifying them into three main groups. Then, the\nproposed model is presented in two stages. In the first stage, different\nmachine learning algorithms are applied to validate the chosen dataset and\napplying features selection methods on it. Thus, the best accuracy was achieved\nby utilizing only 20 features out of 48 features combined with Random Forest is\n98.11%. While in the second stage, the same dataset is applied to various fuzzy\nlogic algorithms. As well the experimental results from the application of\nFuzzy logic algorithms were incredible. Where in applying the FURIA algorithm\nwith only five features the accuracy rate was 99.98%. Finally, comparison and\ndiscussion of the results between applying machine learning algorithms and\nfuzzy logic algorithms is done.
