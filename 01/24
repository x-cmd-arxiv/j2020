Using this, we simulated the\nstandard worklist processing \"first-in, first-out\" (FIFO) and compared it with\na worklist prioritization based on urgency. Examination prioritization was\nperformed by the AI, classifying eight different pathological findings ranked\nin descending order of urgency: pneumothorax, pleural effusion, infiltrate,\ncongestion, atelectasis, cardiomegaly, mass and foreign object. Furthermore, we\nintroduced an upper limit for the maximum waiting time, after which the highest\nurgency is assigned to the examination.\n  The average RTAT for all critical findings was significantly reduced in all\nPrioritization-simulations compared to the FIFO-simulation (e.g. pneumothorax:\n35.6 min vs. 80.1 min; p $<0.0001$), while the maximum RTAT for most findings\nincreased at the same time (e.g. pneumothorax: 1293 min vs 890 min; p\n$<0.0001$).

After learning each task, the Residual is analyzed for redundancy, both\nwithin itself and with the learnt Core space.

The study uses, among others, data from GASP-WEBT, Swift,\nNuSTAR, Fermi-LAT, VERITAS, and MAGIC. The large blazar activity, and the 43\nhours of simultaneous NuSTAR and MAGIC/VERITAS observations, permitted\nvariability studies on 15 minute time bins, and over three X-ray bands (3-7\nkeV, 7-30 keV and 30-80 keV) and three very-high-energy (>0.1 TeV, hereafter\nVHE) gamma-ray bands (0.2-0.4 TeV, 0.4-0.8 TeV and >0.8 TeV). We detected\nsubstantial flux variations on multi-hour and sub-hour timescales in all the\nX-ray and VHE gamma-ray bands. The characteristics of the sub-hour flux\nvariations are essentially energy-independent, while the multi-hour flux\nvariations can have a strong dependence on the energy of the X-ray and the VHE\ngamma rays. The three VHE bands and the three X-ray bands are positively\ncorrelated with no time-lag, but the strength and the characteristics of the\ncorrelation changes substantially over time and across energy bands. Our\nfindings favour multi-zone scenarios for explaining the achromatic/chromatic\nvariability of the fast/slow components of the light curves, as well as the\nchanges in the flux-flux correlation on day-long timescales. We interpret these\nresults within a magnetic reconnection scenario, where the multi-hour flux\nvariations are dominated by the combined emission from various plasmoids of\ndifferent sizes and velocities, while the sub-hour flux variations are\ndominated by the emission from a single small plasmoid moving across the\nmagnetic reconnection layer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jan 2020 17:20:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-22"}

With an effective\noperator named Camera-based Batch Normalization (CBN), we force the image data\nof all cameras to fall onto the same subspace, so that the distribution gap\nbetween any camera pair is largely shrunk.

Most algorithms are based on maximizing the likelihood, which\ncorresponds to the M(oment)-projection of the data distribution to the model\ndistribution. The M-projection forces the model to average over modes it cannot\nrepresent. In contrast, the I(information)-projection ignores such modes in the\ndata and concentrates on the modes the model can represent. Such behavior is\nappealing whenever we deal with highly multi-modal data where modelling single\nmodes correctly is more important than covering all the modes. Despite this\nadvantage, the I-projection is rarely used in practice due to the lack of\nalgorithms that can efficiently optimize it based on data. In this work, we\npresent a new algorithm called Expected Information Maximization (EIM) for\ncomputing the I-projection solely based on samples for general latent variable\nmodels, where we focus on Gaussian mixtures models and Gaussian mixtures of\nexperts. Our approach applies a variational upper bound to the I-projection\nobjective which decomposes the original objective into single objectives for\neach mixture component as well as for the coefficients, allowing an efficient\noptimization. Similar to GANs, our approach employs discriminators but uses a\nmore stable optimization procedure, using a tight upper bound. We show that our\nalgorithm is much more effective in computing the I-projection than recent GAN\napproaches and we illustrate the effectiveness of our approach for modelling\nmulti-modal behavior on two pedestrian and traffic prediction datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jan 2020 17:24:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-24"}

However, HfO$_2$ has various stable and metastable polymorphs with\nquite similar structures and energies. Identifying and stabilizing the\nferroelectric functional phases of HfO$_2$ have attracted intensive research\ninterest in recent years. In this work, first-principles calculations on\n(111)-oriented HfO$_2$ are used to discover that imposing an in-plane shear\nstrain on the tetragonal phase induces a nonpolar to polar phase transition.\nThis in-plane shear-induced polar phase is shown to be an epitaxial distortion\nof a known metastable ferroelectric $Pnm2_1$ phase of HfO$_2$. It is proposed\nthat this ferroelectric $Pnm2_1$ phase can account for the recently observed\nferroelectricity in the (111)-oriented HfO$_2$-based thin film [Nature\nMaterials 17, 1095-1100 (2018)].

At the same time, the\ndisk may be sufficiently ionised for magnetic fields to play some role in the\ndynamics. Though usually neglected, the impact of magnetism on the GI may be\ncritical, with consequences for several processes: the efficiency of accretion,\nspiral structure formation, fragmentation, and the dynamics of solids. In this\npaper, we report on global three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical simulations\nof a self-gravitating protoplanetary disk using the meshless finite mass (MFM)\nLagrangian technique. We confirm that GI spiral waves trigger a dynamo that\namplifies an initial magnetic field to nearly thermal amplitudes (plasma beta <\n10), an order of magnitude greater than that generated by the\nmagneto-rotational instability alone. We also determine the dynamo's nonlinear\nback reaction on the gravitoturbulent flow: the saturated state is\nsubstantially hotter, with an associated larger Toomre parameter and weaker,\nmore 'flocculent' spirals. But perhaps of greater import is the dynamo's\nboosting of accretion via a significant Maxwell stress; mass accretion is\nenhanced by factors of several relative to either pure GI or pure MRI. Our\nsimulations use ideal MHD, an admittedly poor approximation in protoplanetary\ndisks, and thus future studies should explore the full gamut of non-ideal MHD.\nIn preparation for that, we exhibit a small number of Ohmic runs that reveal\nthat the dynamo, if anything, is stronger in a non-ideal environment. This work\nconfirms that magnetic fields are a potentially critical ingredient in\ngravitoturbulent young disks, possibly controlling their evolution, especially\nvia their enhancement of (potentially episodic) accretion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jan 2020 17:36:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-25"}

This can be done\nin a way consistent with gravity if the vector potential is considered as a\nvariable of adiabatic order one. Assuming this, we further extend the method to\ndeal with Dirac fields in four spacetime dimensions. This requires a\nself-consistent ansatz for the adiabatic expansion, in presence of a prescribed\ntime-dependent electric field, which is different from the conventional\nexpansion used for scalar fields. Our proposal is consistent, in the massless\nlimit, with the conformal anomaly. We also provide evidence that our proposed\nadiabatic expansion for the fermionic modes parallels the Schwinger-DeWitt\nadiabatic expansion of the two-point function.

Despite their successes, these parsimonious approaches\nsometimes conflict with biological realism by overlooking organism\nsimilarities. Here, we leverage a recently developed notion of biological\ndiversity that simultaneously accounts for organism similarities and retains\nthe optimization strategy underlying compressive-sensing-based approaches. We\ndemonstrate that minimizing biological diversity still produces sparse\ntaxonomic profiles and we experimentally validate superiority to existing\ncompressive-sensing-based approaches. Despite showing that the objective\nfunction is almost never convex and often concave, generally yielding NP-hard\nproblems, we exhibit ways of representing organism similarities for which\nminimizing diversity can be performed via a sequence of linear programs\nguaranteed to decrease diversity. Better yet, when biological similarity is\nquantified by $k$-mer co-occurrence (a popular notion in bioinformatics),\nminimizing diversity actually reduces to one linear program that can utilize\nmultiple $k$-mer sizes to enhance performance. In proof-of-concept experiments,\nwe verify that the latter procedure can lead to significant gains when\ntaxonomically profiling a metagenomic sample, both in terms of reconstruction\naccuracy and computational performance.

In this paper, we\npropose an interpretable deep reinforcement learning method for end-to-end\nautonomous driving, which is able to handle complex urban scenarios. A\nsequential latent environment model is introduced and learned jointly with the\nreinforcement learning process. With this latent model, a semantic birdeye mask\ncan be generated, which is enforced to connect with a certain intermediate\nproperty in today's modularized framework for the purpose of explaining the\nbehaviors of learned policy.

One of the challenges of FL is that of\ncommunication overhead due to FL's iterative nature and large model sizes. One\nrecent direction to alleviate communication bottleneck in FL is to let users\ncommunicate simultaneously over a multiple access channel (MAC), possibly\nmaking better use of the communication resources.\n  In this paper, we consider the problem of FL learning over a MAC.

The deep decoder is an underparameterized\nand most importantly unlearned natural signal model similar to the Deep Image\nPrior. No knowledge of the specific inverse problem is needed in the training\nof the GAN underlying our method. For compressive sensing and image\nsuperresolution, our hybrid model exhibits consistently higher PSNRs than both\nthe GAN priors and Deep Decoder separately, both on in-distribution and\nout-of-distribution images. This model provides a method for extensibly and\ncheaply leveraging both the benefits of learned and unlearned image recovery\npriors in inverse problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jan 2020 18:37:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-27"}

The ratio\nof these masses, $w$, sets the velocity scale above which momentum transfer due\nto DM self-interactions becomes inefficient.

The abundance\nand properties of surviving subhalos are consistent with being determined\nprimarily by subhalo--host halo interactions. In particular, subhalos on radial\norbits in models with larger values of the cross section at the host halo\nvelocity scale are more susceptible to tidal disruption owing to mass loss from\nram pressure stripping caused by self-interactions with the host. This\nmechanism suppresses the abundance of surviving subhalos relative to\ncollisionless DM simulations, with stronger suppression for larger values of\n$w$.

For vanilla cold dark matter (CDM) cosmologies,\nthe summary statistics display strong evolution and redshift-space effects, and\nare also sensitive to cosmological parameter values for realistic tracer\nsamples. Comparing the VVF of galaxies in the GAMA survey with that of\nabundance matched CDM (sub)haloes tentatively reveals environmental effects in\nGAMA beyond halo mass (modulo unmodelled satellite properties). Our exploratory\nanalysis thus paves the way for using the VVF as a new probe of galaxy\nevolution physics as well as the nature of dark matter and dark energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jan 2020 19:00:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 23 May 2020 06:11:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-27"}

The flare, which rose in\n$\\sim25$ seconds to a maximum flux 6 times larger than the persistent emission,\nis highly pulsed with an rms pulsed fraction of $53\\%$. The pulse profile shape\nconsists of two peaks separated by half a rotational cycle, with a peak flux\nratio of $\\sim$2. The flare spectrum is thermal with an average temperature of\n2.1 keV. Phase resolved spectroscopy show that the two peaks possess the same\ntemperature, but differ in size. These observational results along with simple\nlight curve modeling indicate that two identical antipodal spots, likely the\nmagnetic poles, are heated simultaneously at the onset of the flare and for its\nfull duration. Hence, the origin of the flare has to be connected to the global\ndipolar structure of the magnetar. This might best be achieved externally, via\ntwists to closed magnetospheric dipolar field lines seeding bombardment of\npolar footpoint locales with energetic pairs. Approximately 1.86 hours\nfollowing the onset of the flare, a short burst with its own 3-minute thermal\ntail occurred. The burst tail is also pulsating at the spin period of the\nsource and phase-aligned with the flare profile, implying an intimate\nconnection between the two phenomena. The burst may have been caused by a\nmagnetic reconnection event in the same twisted dipolar field lines anchored to\nthe surface hot spots, with subsequent return currents supplying extra heat to\nthese polar caps.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jan 2020 19:01:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-12"}

The\ntransient peaked at an observed absolute magnitude of M_r' = -13.1, although it\nis subject to significant reddening from dust in M51, implying an intrinsic\nM_r' ~ -15.2.

An inherent element in these problems is the\nelement of stochasticity in various aspects, such as the generation output of\nthe units, climate change or frequency and duration of grid outages. Especially\nfor the latter one, outage modeling is crucial to be carefully considered when\ndesigning systems with distributed generation at their core, such as\nmicrogrids. In most studies so far, a single statistical distribution is used,\nsuch as a Poisson Process. However, by taking a closer look at the real outage\ndata provided by the state of NY, it is observed that the outages do not seem\nto come from the same distribution. In some years, there is a huge spike in the\naverage duration per outage and this is because of catastrophic events.\nTherefore, in this study we propose and test an alternative modeling for outage\nevents. This alternative scheme will be based on the premise that outages can\nbe broadly classified into two categories: regular and severe. Under this\ntaxonomy, it can still be assumed that each type of events follows a Poisson\nProcess but outages, in general, follow a Poisson Process which is truly a\nsuperposition of these two types. A reinforcement learning approach is used to\nsolve the expansion planning problem and real location-specific data are used.\nThe results verify our initial hypothesis and show that the optimization\nresults are significantly affected by the outage modeling. To sum up, modeling\naccurately the grid outage events and measuring directly the reliability\nperformance of an energy system during catastrophic failures could provide\ninvaluable tools and insights that could therefore be used for the best\npossible preparation for this type of outages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jan 2020 21:25:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-27"}

Indeed,\ninvestigations that explored and generalized Newton's radial relation,\nincluding algebraic approaches based on noncompact groups such as SO(4,2), have\nnever exhibited a full duality consistent with Newton's.

The dynamics of\nthe window atoms are governed by classic MD equations of motion while continuum\nshock conditions are applied to the continuum atoms.

The first is a smart contract called Data\nExchange, which stores references to Data Orders that different Buyers open in\norder to show to the market that they are interested in buying certain types of\ndata, and provides secure mechanisms to perform the transactions. The second is\nused to process payments from Buyers to Sellers and intermediaries, and is\ncalled Batch Payments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jan 2020 22:20:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 31 Jan 2020 14:41:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-04"}

When the drive is applied in a\nfixed direction, we find that the skyrmions are initially guided in the drive\ndirection but also move transverse to the drive due to the Magnus force. The\nskyrmion Hall angle, which indicates the difference between the skyrmion\ndirection of motion and the drive direction, increases with drive in a series\nof quantized steps as a result of the locking of the skyrmion motion to\nspecific symmetry directions of the obstacle array. On these steps, the\nskyrmions collide with an integer number of obstacles to create a periodic\nmotion. The transitions between the different locking steps are associated with\njumps or dips in the velocity-force curves. In some regimes, the skyrmion Hall\nangle is actually higher than the intrinsic skyrmion Hall angle that would\nappear in the absence of obstacles. In the limit of zero damping, the skyrmion\nHall angle is 90$^\\circ$, and we find that it decreases as the damping\nincreases.

Replacing classical data with quantum\nstates enables fundamentally new computational capabilities with scaling\nadvantages for many applications, and numerous models have been proposed for\nrealizing quantum computation. However, within each of these models, the\nquantum data are transformed by a set of gates that are compiled using solely\nclassical information. Conventional quantum computing models thus break the\ninstruction-data symmetry: classical instructions and quantum data are not\ndirectly interchangeable.

However, there is little work\nfocusing on designing and developing software or packages for the S-FEM. In\nthis paper, we design and implement an open-source package of the parallel\nS-FEM for elastic problems by utilizing the Julia language on multi-core CPU.\nThe Julia language is a fast, easy-to-use, and open-source programming language\nthat was originally designed for high-performance computing. We term our\npackage as juSFEM. To the best of the authors knowledge, juSFEM is the first\npackage of parallel S-FEM developed with the Julia language. To verify the\ncorrectness and evaluate the efficiency of juSFEM, two groups of benchmark\ntests are conducted. The benchmark results show that (1) juSFEM can achieve\naccurate results when compared to commercial FEM software ABAQUS, and (2)\njuSFEM only requires 543 seconds to calculate the displacements of a 3D elastic\ncantilever beam model which is composed of approximately 2 million tetrahedral\nelements, while in contrast the commercial FEM software needs 930 seconds for\nthe same calculation model; (3) the parallel juSFEM executed on the 24-core CPU\nis approximately 20x faster than the corresponding serial version. Moreover,\nthe structure and function of juSFEM are easily modularized, and the code in\njuSFEM is clear and readable, which is convenient for further development.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jan 2020 23:37:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-21"}

A\ncommunity-driven protocol named genomic data-sharing beacon protocol has been\nwidely adopted for sharing genomic data. The system aims to provide a secure,\neasy to implement, and standardized interface for data sharing by only allowing\nyes/no queries on the presence of specific alleles in the dataset. However,\nbeacon protocol was recently shown to be vulnerable against membership\ninference attacks. In this paper, we show that privacy threats against genomic\ndata sharing beacons are not limited to membership inference. We identify and\nanalyze a novel vulnerability of genomic data-sharing beacons: genome\nreconstruction. We show that it is possible to successfully reconstruct a\nsubstantial part of the genome of a victim when the attacker knows the victim\nhas been added to the beacon in a recent update.

A growing body of prior work has demonstrated that\nmembership inference attack (MIA) can disclose specific private information in\nthe training data to an attacker. Meanwhile, the algorithmic fairness of\nmachine learning has increasingly caught attention from both academia and\nindustry. Algorithmic fairness ensures that the machine learning models do not\ndiscriminate a particular demographic group of individuals (e.g., black and\nfemale people). Given that MIA is indeed a learning model, it raises a serious\nconcern if MIA ``fairly'' treats all groups of individuals equally. In other\nwords, whether a particular group is more vulnerable against MIA than the other\ngroups. This paper examines the algorithmic fairness issue in the context of\nMIA and its defenses. First, for fairness evaluation, it formalizes the\nnotation of vulnerability disparity (VD) to quantify the difference of MIA\ntreatment on different demographic groups. Second, it evaluates VD on four\nreal-world datasets, and shows that VD indeed exists in these datasets. Third,\nit examines the impacts of differential privacy, as a defense mechanism of MIA,\non VD. The results show that although DP brings significant change on VD, it\ncannot eliminate VD completely. Therefore, fourth, it designs a new mitigation\nalgorithm named FAIRPICK to reduce VD. An extensive set of experimental results\ndemonstrate that FAIRPICK can effectively reduce VD for both with and without\nthe DP deployment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jan 2020 01:06:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-27"}

Scholars\nargue that observations of these solar points are useful for developing\ncalendars, informing ritual/ceremonial practices, and predicting seasonal\nchange. This is the foundation of the Eurocentric four-season Julian (and later\nGregorian) calendar. Famous examples include Stonehenge, Newgrange, Chichen\nItza, and Chankillo. Studies at these and other sites tend to focus on solar\npoint observations through alignments in stone arrangements, and the\norientations of monuments. Despite the ongoing study of Indigenous Knowledge in\nAustralia revealing a wealth of information about Aboriginal and Torres Strait\nIslander observations and interpretations of solar, lunar, and stellar\nproperties and motions, very little has been published about the importance and\nuse of solar point observations. The authors examine this topic through four\ncase studies, based on methodological frameworks and approaches in ethnography,\nethnohistory, archaeology, and statistics. Our findings show that Aboriginal\nand Torres Strait Islander people observe the solstices and other significant\nsunrise/sunset points along the horizon for timekeeping and indicating seasonal\nchange - but in ways that are rather different to the four-season model\ndeveloped in Western Europe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jan 2020 05:08:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-27"}

The median reddening is E(B-V) ~ 0.77 +/- 0.10 for type-1 to\ntype-1.9 AGNs with reported column densities. This is notably higher than the\nmedian reddening of AGNs from the SDSS. We attribute this to the selection bias\nof the SDSS towards blue AGNs. For other AGNs we find evidence of a publication\nbias against reporting low column densities. We find a significant correlation\nbetween N_H and E(B-V) but with a large scatter of +/- 1 dex (without\naccounting for uncertainties in measurements). On average the X-ray columns are\nconsistent with those predicted from E(B-V) for a solar neighbourhood\ndust-to-gas ratio. We argue that the large scatter of column densities and\nreddenings can be explained by X-ray column-density variability. For AGNs with\ndetectable broad-line regions (BLRs) that have undergone significant changes of\nSeyfert type (changing-look AGNs) we do not find any statistically significant\ndifferences in N_H or E(B-V) compared to standard type-1 to type-1.9 AGNs.\nThere is no evidence for any type-1 AGNs being Compton-thick. We also analyze\ntype-2 AGNs and find no significant correlation between N_H and narrow-line\nregion reddening. The median column density of LINERs is 22.68 +/- 0.75\ncompared to a column density of 22.90 +/- 0.28 for type-2s. We find the\nmajority of low column density type-2s are LINERs, but N_H is probably\nunderestimated because of scattered X-ray light diluting the photoelectric\nedge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jan 2020 06:33:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-14"}

The diameter of the GeV region found is\n~2.8$^{\\circ}$, larger than the latest estimate of the SNR size from radio\ndata. The gamma-ray emission covers most of the known shell and extends further\nto the north and east of the bulk of the radio emission. The photon spectrum in\nthe 0.5--500 GeV range can be described by a simple power law, $\\frac{dN}{dE}\n\\propto E^{-\\Gamma}$, with a spectral index of $\\Gamma = 1.86\\pm 0.03_{stat}\n\\pm 0.06_{sys}$. In the leptonic scenario, a steep particle spectrum is\nrequired and a distance lower than the previously estimated value of 3 kpc is\nfavored. The possibility that the high-energy emission results from electrons\nthat already escaped the SNR is also investigated. A hadronic scenario for the\ngamma rays yields a particle spectral index of $\\sim2.0$ and no significant\nconstraints on the distance. The production of gamma rays in old SNRs is\ndiscussed. More observations of this source are encouraged to probe the true\nextent of the shell and its age.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jan 2020 09:01:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-05"}

However, they require understanding of data pattern and\noften need a long off-line period to build a model or network for the target\ndata. Providing real-time and proactive anomaly detection for streaming time\nseries without human intervention and domain knowledge is highly valuable since\nit greatly reduces human effort and enables appropriate countermeasures to be\nundertaken before a disastrous damage, failure, or other harmful event occurs.\nHowever, this issue has not been well studied yet. To address it, this paper\nproposes RePAD, which is a Real-time Proactive Anomaly Detection algorithm for\nstreaming time series based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). RePAD utilizes\nshort-term historic data points to predict and determine whether or not the\nupcoming data point is a sign that an anomaly is likely to happen in the near\nfuture. By dynamically adjusting the detection threshold over time, RePAD is\nable to tolerate minor pattern change in time series and detect anomalies\neither proactively or on time.

The moderating role of participant's tenure in the relationship\nbetween content commenting and user continuance is also explored. Using a\nlongitudinal panel dataset collected from a large online Q&A community, this\nresearch empirically tests the effect of content commenting on continued user\nparticipation in the Q&A community. The results show that both comment receipt\nand comment provisioning are important motivating factors for user continuance\nin the community.

Within the modeling framework of DICE, the\npresently estimated SCC valuates policy-uncontrolled emissions against\neconomically unjustified consumption, which makes it irrelevant for application\nin climate-economic policies and, therefore, calls for a replacement by a more\nappropriate indicator.\n  An apparent SCC alternative, which can be employed for policy formulation is\nthe direct output of the DICE model -- the socially optimal marginal abatement\ncost (SMAC), which corresponds to technological possibilities at optimal level\nof carbon emissions abatement. In policy making, because of the previously\nemployed implicit approximation, great attention needs to be paid to the use of\nSCC estimates obtained earlier.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jan 2020 10:09:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 May 2020 10:45:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2021 10:09:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-08"}

ZENs are neighborhoods who\naim to have net zero emissions during their lifetime. While previous work has\nused and studied clustering for designing the energy system of neighborhoods,\nno article dealt with neighborhoods such as ZEN, which have high requirements\nfor the solar irradiance time series, include a CO2 factor time series and have\na zero emission balance limiting the possibilities. To this end several methods\nare used and their results compared. The results are on the one hand the\nperformances of the clustering itself and on the other hand, the performances\nof each method in the optimization model where the data is used. Various\naspects related to the clustering methods are tested. The different aspects\nstudied are: the goal (clustering to obtain days or hours), the algorithm\n(k-means or k-medoids), the normalization method (based on the standard\ndeviation or range of values) and the use of heuristic. The results highlight\nthat k-means offers better results than k-medoids and that k-means was\nsystematically underestimating the objective value while k-medoids was\nconstantly overestimating it. When the choice between clustering days and hours\nis possible, it appears that clustering days offers the best precision and\nsolving time. The choice depends on the formulation used for the optimization\nmodel and the need to model seasonal storage. The choice of the normalization\nmethod has the least impact, but the range of values method show some\nadvantages in terms of solving time. When a good representation of the solar\nirradiance time series is needed, a higher number of days or using hours is\nnecessary. The choice depends on what solving time is acceptable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jan 2020 10:22:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-27"}

The thermodynamic pressure is defined\nby the Gibbs-Duhem equation. Chemical potentials and pressure are derived from\na thermodynamic potential, the Helmholtz free energy, with a bulk density\nallowed to be a general convex function of the mass densities of the\nconstituents.

In\nparticular, when the propensity score model already includes covariates that\nare sufficient to adjust for confounding, then the addition of covariates that\nare associated with either treatment or outcome alone, but not both, should not\nsystematically change the effect estimator. The proposal, therefore, entails\nfirst prioritizing covariates for inclusion in the propensity score model, then\nusing a change-in-estimate approach to select the smallest adjustment set that\nyields a stable effect estimate.

In the search for high performance\ndevices without variability, it is of high interest to allow deterministic\nfabrication of nanowire quantum dots, avoiding sample variability and obtaining\natomic scale precision on the fabricated dot size. In this paper, we present a\nreliable fabrication process to produce sub-10 nm Ge quantum dots (QDs), using\na combination of ex-situ thermal annealing via rapid thermal annealing (RTA)\nand in-situ Joule heating technique in a transmission electron microscope\n(TEM). First we present in-situ direct joule heating experiments showing how\nthe heating electrode could be damaged due to the formation of Al crystals and\nvoids at the vicinity of the metal/NW contact, likely related with\nelectro-migration phenomena. We show that the contact quality can be preserved\nby including an additional ex-situ RTA step prior to the in-situ heating. The\nin-situ observations also show in real-time how the exchange reaction initiates\nsimultaneously from several locations underneath the Al contact pad, and the Al\ncrystal grows gradually inside the initial Ge NW with the growth interface\nalong a Ge(111) lattice plane. Once the reaction front moves out from\nunderneath the contact metal, two factors jeopardize an atomically accurate\ncontrol of the Al/Ge reaction interface.

Two distinct mechanisms have been observed, where the final\nmagnetization state is either defined by the helicity of many incoming laser\npulses, or toggled by a single pulse. What has thus far been elusive, yet\nessential for applications, is the deterministic writing of a specific\nmagnetization state with a single laser pulse. In this work we experimentally\ndemonstrate such a mechanism by making use of a spin polarized current which is\noptically generated in a ferromagnetic reference layer, assisting or hindering\nswitching in an adjacent Co/Gd bilayer. We show deterministic writing of an\n'up' and 'down' state using a sequence of 1 or 2 pulses, respectively.\nMoreover, we demonstrate the non-local origin of the effect by varying the\nmagnitude of the generated spin current. Our demonstration of deterministic\nmagnetization writing could provide an essential step towards the\nimplementation of future optically addressable spintronic memory devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jan 2020 14:35:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-05"}

The approach consists of a meshless Fragile\nPoints Method (FPM) being utilized for spatial discretization, and a Local\nVariational Iteration (LVI) scheme for time discretization. Anisotropy and\nnonhomogeneity do not give rise to any difficulties in the present\nimplementation. The meshless FPM is based on a Galerkin weak-form formulation\nand thus leads to symmetric matrices. Local, very simple, polynomial and\ndiscontinuous trial and test functions are employed. In the meshless FPM,\nInterior Penalty Numerical Fluxes are introduced to ensure the consistency of\nthe method. The LVIM in the time domain is generated as a combination of the\nVariational Iteration Method (VIM) applied over a large time interval and\nnumerical algorithms. A set of collocation nodes are employed in each finitely\nlarge time interval. The FPM + LVIM approach is capable of solving transient\nheat transfer problems in complex geometries with mixed boundary conditions,\nincluding pre-existing cracks. Numerical examples are presented in 2D and 3D\ndomains. Both functionally graded materials and composite materials are\nconsidered. It is shown that, with suitable computational parameters, the FPM +\nLVIM approach is not only accurate, but also efficient, and has reliable\nstability under relatively large time intervals. The present methodology\nrepresents a considerable improvement to the current state of science in\ncomputational transient heat conduction in anisotropic nonhomogeneous media.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jan 2020 18:17:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-27"}

In\nthe specific case of tabular datasets represented as several CSV or Excel\nfiles, query translation approaches have been applied by considering each\nsource as a single table that can be loaded into a relational database\nmanagement system (RDBMS). Nevertheless, constraints over these tables are not\nrepresented; thus, neither consistency among attributes nor indexes over tables\nare enforced. As a consequence, efficiency of the SPARQL-to-SQL translation\nprocess may be affected, as well as the completeness of the answers produced\nduring the evaluation of the generated SQL query. Our work is focused on\napplying implicit constraints on the OBDA query translation process over\ntabular data. We propose Morph-CSV, a framework for querying tabular data that\nexploits information from typical OBDA inputs (e.g., mappings, queries) to\nenforce constraints that can be used together with any SPARQL-to-SQL OBDA\nengine. Morph-CSV relies on both a constraint component and a set of constraint\noperators. For a given set of constraints, the operators are applied to each\ntype of constraint with the aim of enhancing query completeness and\nperformance. We evaluate Morph-CSV in several domains: e-commerce with the BSBM\nbenchmark; transportation with a benchmark using the GTFS dataset from the\nMadrid subway; and biology with a use case extracted from the Bio2RDF project.\nWe compare and report the performance of two SPARQL-to-SQL OBDA engines,\nwithout and with the incorporation of MorphCSV.

Rather than beginning with\nan inequality derivation, a hierarchy of model types is constructed, each\ndistinguished by appropriately parameterized conditional probabilities. This\nhierarchy ranks the \"classical\" model types in terms of their ability to\nreproduce QM statistics or not. The analysis goes beyond the usual\nconsideration of model types that \"fall short\" (i.e., satisfy all of the CHSH\ninequalities) to ones that are \"excessive\" (i.e., not only violate CHSH but\neven exceed a Tsirelson bound). This approach clearly shows that\nnoncontextuality is the most general property of an operational model that\nblocks replication of at least some QM statistical predictions. Factorizability\nis naturally revealed to be a special case of noncontextuality. The same is\ntrue for the combination of remote context independence and outcome determinism\n(RCI+OD). It is noncontextuality that determines the dividing line between\n\"classical\" model instances that satisfy the CHSH inequalities and those that\ndon't. Outcome deterministic operational models are revealed to be the\n\"building blocks\" of all the rest, including quantum mechanical, noncontextual,\nand contextual ones. The set of noncontextual model instances is exactly the\nconvex hull of all 16 RCI+OD model instances, and furthermore, the set of all\nmodel instances, including all QM ones, is equal to the convex hull of the 256\nOD model instances. It is shown that, under a mild assumption, the construction\nof convex hulls of finite ensembles of OD model instances is (mathematically)\nequivalent to the traditional hidden variables approach. Plots and figures\nprovide visual affirmation of many of the results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 23 Jan 2020 20:45:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Jun 2020 21:22:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 3 Apr 2022 18:43:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-05"}

In the BL-MAB model, the set\nof available arms grows (or balloons) over time. In contrast to the classical\nMAB setting where the regret is computed with respect to the best arm overall,\nthe regret in a BL-MAB setting is computed with respect to the best available\narm at each time. We first observe that the existing stochastic MAB algorithms\nresult in linear regret for the BL-MAB model. We prove that, if the best arm is\nequally likely to arrive at any time instant, a sub-linear regret cannot be\nachieved. Next, we show that if the best arm is more likely to arrive in the\nearly rounds, one can achieve sub-linear regret. Our proposed algorithm\ndetermines (1) the fraction of the time horizon for which the newly arriving\narms should be explored and (2) the sequence of arm pulls in the exploitation\nphase from among the explored arms. Making reasonable assumptions on the\narrival distribution of the best arm in terms of the thinness of the\ndistribution's tail, we prove that the proposed algorithm achieves sub-linear\ninstance-independent regret. We further quantify explicit dependence of regret\non the arrival distribution parameters. We reinforce our theoretical findings\nwith extensive simulation results. We conclude by showing that our algorithm\nwould achieve sub-linear regret even if (a) the distributional parameters are\nnot exactly known, but are obtained using a reasonable learning mechanism or\n(b) the best arm is not more likely to arrive early, but a large fraction of\narms is likely to arrive relatively early.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jan 2020 04:35:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Oct 2020 10:41:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 2021 12:33:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-23"}
