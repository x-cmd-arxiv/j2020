In this work our aim is to\ndevelop first steps towards a theoretical understanding of vortex splitting\nphenomena. To this end, we study bifurcations of global flow patterns in\nparameter-dependent two-dimensional incompressible flows, with the flow\npatterns of interest corresponding to specific invariant sets. Under small\nrandom perturbations these sets become almost-invariant and can be computed and\nstudied by means of a set-oriented approach, where the underlying dynamics is\ndescribed in terms of a reversible finite-state Markov chain. Almost-invariant\nsets are obtained from the sign structure of leading eigenvectors of the\ncorresponding transition matrix. By a flow pattern bifurcation we mean a\nqualitative change in the form of a break-up of an almost-invariant set, when a\ncritical external parameter of the underlying dynamical system is reached. For\ndifferent examples and settings we follow the spectrum and the corresponding\neigenvectors under continuous changes of the underlying system and yield\nindicators for different bifurcation scenarios for almost-invariant sets. In\nparticular, we study a Duffing-type oscillator, which is known to undergo a\nclassic pitchfork bifurcation. We find that the set-oriented analogue of this\nclassical bifurcation includes a splitting of a rotating pattern, which has\ngeneric precursor signal that can be deduced from the behavior of the spectrum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Jan 2020 16:49:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-07"}

The strong tidal dissipation in the couple Jupiter-Io is spread to\nall the moons involved in the Laplace resonance (Io, Europa, and Ganymede),\nleading to a migration of their orbits.\n  Aims. We aim to characterize the future behavior of the Galilean satellites\nover the Solar System lifetime and to quantify the stability of the Laplace\nresonance. Since tidal dissipation makes possible the exit from the current\nresonances or capture into new ones, we investigate the capture of Callisto\ninto resonance.\n  Methods. We perform hundreds of propagations using an improved version of a\nrecent semi-analytical model. As Ganymede moves outwards, it approaches the 2:1\nresonance with Callisto, inducing a temporary chaotic motion in the system. For\nthis reason, we draw a statistical picture of the outcome of the resonant\nencounter.\n  Results. The system can settle into two distinct outcomes: A) a chain of\nthree 2:1 two-body resonances (Io-Europa, Europa-Ganymede and\nGanymede-Callisto), or B) a resonant chain involving the 2:1 two-body resonance\nIo-Europa plus at least one pure 4:2:1 three-body resonance, most frequently\nbetween Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. In case A (56\\% of the simulations), the\nLaplace resonance is always preserved and the eccentricities remain confined to\nsmall values below 0.01. In case B (44\\% of the simulations), the Laplace\nresonance is generally disrupted and the eccentricities of Ganymede and\nCallisto can increase up to about 0.1, making this configuration unstable and\ndriving the system into new resonances.\n  Conclusion. From our results, the capture of Callisto into resonance appears\nto be extremely likely (100\\% of our simulations). Assuming the most recent\nestimate of the dissipation between Io and Jupiter, the resonant encounter\nhappens at about 1.5 Gyrs from now.

Integrating these models' complementary relational and\ncommunicative data may be especially helpful if predicting rare events or\nclassifying members of hidden populations - tasks requiring huge and sparse\ndatasets for generalizable analyses. For example, due to social stigma and\ncomorbidities, mental health support groups often form in amorphous online\ngroups.

Thus, energy is\nredistributed through the muscle's tissue as it contracts, with only a\ncomponent of this energy being used to do mechanical work and develop forces in\nthe muscle's line-of-action. Understanding how the strain-energy potentials are\nredistributed through the muscle tissue will help enlighten why the mechanical\nperformance of whole muscle in its line-of-action does not match the\nperformance that would be expected from the contractile elements alone.

Here we consider the process of making super basic\nionic liquids by a similar procedure, and encounter the problem of finding\nmolecular bases of high enough basicity to accept protons from weak acids to\nform ionic liquids of both high basicity and high iconicity. The consequence is\nthat no ionic liquid with proton activity outside the aqueous base limit of pH\n=14, has yet been made. The problem is resolved by considering the six possible\ntypes of proton transfer processes, selecting the process of transfer from weak\nmolecular acids to very basic ionic anions - partnered with alkali metal\ncations, and then replacing the alkali metals cations with reduction-resistant\norganic cations by metathesis. In many cases the alkali metal salts of target\nanions are commercially available, and only the metathesis reaction is needed\nto obtain the basic ionic liquid. A thermodynamic route to the assessment of\nbasicity levels on the water scale, i.e. relative to the H3O+/H2O\ndonor/acceptor level, is described, and is verified for the case of pure H2SO4.\nIt is then applied to show how to extend the possible proton activity range\ndown, by some 25 orders of magnitude, to reach pKa values of order 40, with\neven higher values possible in principle.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Jan 2020 01:47:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-07"}

The cost of linear\nequations dominates the numerical simulation of radiation diffusion\napplications, such as inertial confinement fusion, etc. {Usually,} iterative\nmethods are used to solve the linear systems in {a} real application.\n{Moreover, the solution of the previous nonlinear iteration or the solution of\nthe previous time step is typically used as the initial guess for solving the\ncurrent linear equations.} Because of the strong local character in ICF, with\nthe advancing of nonlinear iteration and time step, the solution of the linear\nsystem changes dramatically in some local domain, and changes mildly or even\nhas no change in the rest domain. In this paper, a local {character-based}\nmethod is proposed to solve the linear systems of radiation diffusion problems.\nThe proposed method consists of three steps: firstly, a local domain (algebraic\ndomain) is constructed; secondly, the subsystem on the local domain is solved;\nand lastly, the whole system will be solved. Two methods are given to construct\nthe local domain. One is based on the spatial gradient, and the other is based\non the residual. Numerical tests for a two-dimensional heat conduction model\nproblem, and two real application models, the multi-group radiation diffusion\nequations and the three temperature energy equations, are conducted. The test\nresults show that the solution time for solving the linear system can be\nreduced dramatically by using the local character-based method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Jan 2020 03:02:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-19"}

With the rapid rise of deep learning, many recently\nproposed video super-resolution methods use convolutional neural networks in\nconjunction with explicit motion compensation to capitalize on statistical\ndependencies within and across low-resolution frames. Two common issues of such\nmethods are noteworthy. Firstly, the quality of the final reconstructed HR\nvideo is often very sensitive to the accuracy of motion estimation.

Although much effort has been put\non this topic, the results archived are still not good enough. Existing methods\nmainly employ RNNs to model trajectories semantically due to the inherent\nsequential attribute of trajectories. However, these approaches are weak at\nPoint of Interest (POI) representation learning and trajectory feature\ndetection. Thus, the performance of existing solutions is far from the\nrequirements of practical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel\nCNN-based Trajectory Owner Prediction (CNNTOP) method. Firstly, we connect all\nPOI according to trajectories from all users. The result is a connected graph\nthat can be used to generate more informative POI sequences than other\napproaches. Secondly, we employ the Node2Vec algorithm to encode each POI into\na low-dimensional real value vector. Then, we transform each trajectory into a\nfixed-dimensional matrix, which is similar to an image. Finally, a CNN is\ndesigned to detect features and predict the owner of a given trajectory. The\nCNN can extract informative features from the matrix representations of\ntrajectories by convolutional operations, Batch normalization, and $K$-max\npooling operations. Extensive experiments on real datasets demonstrate that\nCNNTOP substantially outperforms existing solutions in terms of\nmacro-Precision, macro-Recall, macro-F1, and accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Jan 2020 07:58:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-07"}

Many different approaches for morphing attack detection have been\nproposed in the scientific literature. However, the morphing attack detection\nalgorithms proposed so far have only been trained and tested on datasets whose\ndistributions of image characteristics are either very limited (e.g. only\ncreated with a single morphing tool) or rather unrealistic (e.g. no print-scan\ntransformation). As a consequence, these methods easily overfit on certain\nimage types and the results presented cannot be expected to apply to real-world\nscenarios. For example, the results of the latest NIST Face Recognition Vendor\nTest MORPH show that the submitted MAD algorithms lack robustness and\nperformance when considering unseen and challenging datasets. In this work,\nsubsets of the FERET and FRGCv2 face databases are used to create a large\nrealistic database for training and testing of morphing attack detection\nalgorithms, containing a large number of ICAO-compliant bona fide facial\nimages, corresponding unconstrained probe images, and morphed images created\nwith four different tools. Furthermore, multiple post-processings are applied\non the reference images, e.g. print-scan and JPEG2000 compression. On this\ndatabase, previously proposed differential morphing algorithms are evaluated\nand compared. In addition, the application of deep face representations for\ndifferential morphing attack detection algorithms is investigated. It is shown\nthat algorithms based on deep face representations can achieve very high\ndetection performance (less than 3\\%~\\mbox{D-EER}) and robustness with respect\nto various post-processings. Finally, the limitations of the developed methods\nare analyzed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Jan 2020 09:39:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Apr 2020 07:28:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-06"}

In the\ncontext of correlation-based processing, such arrays enable to resolve more\nuncorrelated sources than physical sensors. This property of sparse arrays\nstems from the size of their difference coarrays, defined as the differences of\nelement locations. Thus, the design of sparse arrays with large difference\ncoarrays is of great interest. In addition, other array properties such as\nsymmetry, robustness and array economy are important in different applications.\nNumerous studies have proposed diverse sparse geometries, focusing on certain\nproperties while lacking others. Incorporating multiple properties into the\ndesign task leads to combinatorial problems which are generally NP-hard. For\nsmall arrays these optimization problems can be solved by brute force, however,\nin large scale they become intractable. In this paper, we propose a scalable\nsystematic way to design large sparse arrays considering multiple properties.\nTo that end, we introduce a fractal array design in which a generator array is\nrecursively expanded according to its difference coarray. Our main result\nstates that for an appropriate choice of the generator such fractal arrays\nexhibit large difference coarrays. Furthermore, we show that the fractal arrays\ninherit their properties from their generators.

In recent years, machine learning techniques have been\nexplored to address this gap. We propose a framework for leveraging machine\nlearning techniques to scale-up exact combinatorial optimization algorithms. In\ncontrast to the existing approaches based on deep-learning, reinforcement\nlearning and restricted Boltzmann machines that attempt to directly learn the\noutput of the optimization problem from its input (with limited success), our\nframework learns the relatively simpler task of pruning the elements in order\nto reduce the size of the problem instances. In addition, our framework uses\nonly interpretable learning models based on intuitive features and thus the\nlearning process provides deeper insights into the optimization problem and the\ninstance class, that can be used for designing better heuristics. For the\nclassical maximum clique enumeration problem, we show that our framework can\nprune a large fraction of the input graph (around 99 % of nodes in case of\nsparse graphs) and still detect almost all of the maximum cliques. This results\nin several fold speedups of state-of-the-art algorithms. Furthermore, the model\nused in our framework highlights that the chi-squared value of neighborhood\ndegree has a statistically significant correlation with the presence of a node\nin a maximum clique, particularly in dense graphs which constitute a\nsignificant challenge for modern solvers.

We also consider conformity in groups with four types of central: passive\nearly-types, star-forming spirals, passive spirals and star-forming early-types\n(which are very rarely centrals), finding that the signal of morphological\nconformity is strongest around passive centrals regardless of morphology;\nalthough blue spiral centrals are also more likely than average to have blue\nspiral satellites. We interpret these observations of the relative size of the\nconformity signal as supporting a scenario where star-formation properties are\nrelatively easily changed, while morphology changes less often/more slowly for\ngalaxies in the group environment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Jan 2020 13:15:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-07"}

The filament was\ncomposed of two parts, the eastern part (EP) and western part (WP). We focus on\nlongitudinal oscillations of the EP, which were enhanced by two homologous\nC-class flares in the same AR. The C1.3 flare was confined without a CME. Both\nEP and WP of the filament were slightly disturbed and survived the flare. After\n5 hrs, eruption of the WP generated a C2.6 flare and a narrow, jet-like CME.\nThree oscillating threads (thd$_a$, thd$_b$, thd$_c$) are obviously identified\nin the EP and their oscillations are naturally divided into three phases by the\ntwo flares. The initial amplitude ranges from 1.6 to 30 Mm with a mean value of\n$\\sim$14 Mm. The period ranges from 34 to 73 minutes with a mean value of\n$\\sim$53 minutes.

We mainly observed pronounced increases in the\nspectral peak energy for every increment of l of the incident twisted light.\nThe observed non-linear l-dependence of the spectral blue shifts evidences the\nOAM transfer from the exciting twisted light to the valley excitons in ML-TMDs,\nwhich is well accounted for by our analysis and computational simulation. Even\nmore excitingly, the twisted light excitation is shown to make excitonic\ntransitions relative to the transferred OAM, enabling us to infer the exciton\nband dispersion from the measured spectral shifts. Consequently, the measured\nnon-linear l-dependent spectral shifts revealed an unusual lightlike exciton\nband dispersion of valley excitons in ML-TMDs that is predicted by previous\ntheoretical studies and evidenced for the first time via our experimental setup\nthat utilizes the unique twisted light source.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 5 Jan 2020 15:56:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-07"}

A key challenge faced in\nthis scenario is to determine the values of these unknown parameters against\nknown behavioral specifications. The solutions that have been presented so far\nestimate the parameters of a given model against a single specification whereas\na correct model is expected to satisfy all the behavioral specifications when\ninstantiated with a single set of parameter values. We present a new method,\nBioMETA, to address this problem such that a single set of parameter values\ncauses a parameterized stochastic biochemical model to satisfy all the given\nprobabilistic temporal logic behavioral specifications simultaneously. Our\nmethod is based on combining a multiple hypothesis testing based statistical\nmodel checking technique with simulated annealing search to look for a single\nset of parameter values so that the given parameterized model satisfies\nmultiple probabilistic behavioral specifications.
