While the original goal was to perform multi-turn\nextraction from the CERN Proton Synchrotron (PS), several other applications\nhave been proposed. In this paper, the study of EC generation in the presence\nof charged particle beams with multimode horizontal distribution is presented.\nSuch a peculiar distribution can be generated by different approaches, one of\nwhich consists in splitting the initial Gaussian beam distribution by crossing\na non-linear resonance. In this paper, the outcome of detailed numerical\nsimulations is presented and discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jan 2020 17:54:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

Red supergiant (RSG)\nmass-loss is poorly understood theoretically, and so stellar models rely on\npurely empirical \\mdot-luminosity relations to calculate evolution. Empirical\nprescriptions usually scale with luminosity and effective temperature, but\n$\\dot{M}$ should also depend on the current mass and hence the surface gravity\nof the star, yielding more than one possible $\\dot{M}$ for the same position on\nthe Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. One can solve this degeneracy by measuring\n$\\dot{M}$ for RSGs that reside in clusters, where age and initial mass ($M_{\\rm\ninit}$) are known. In this paper we derive $\\dot{M}$ values and luminosities\nfor RSGs in two clusters, NGC 2004 and RSGC1. Using newly derived $M_{\\rm\ninit}$ measurements, we combine the results with those of clusters with a range\nof ages and derive an $M_{\\rm init}$-dependent $\\dot{M}$-prescription. When\ncomparing this new prescription to the treatment of mass-loss currently\nimplemented in evolutionary models, we find models drastically over-predict the\ntotal mass-loss, by up to a factor of 20. Importantly, the most massive RSGs\nexperience the largest downward revision in their mass-loss rates, drastically\nchanging the impact of wind mass-loss on their evolution. Our results suggest\nthat for most initial masses of RSG progenitors, quiescent mass-loss during the\nRSG phase is not effective at removing a significant fraction of the H-envelope\nprior to core-collapse, and we discuss the implications of this for stellar\nevolution and observations of SNe and SN progenitors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jan 2020 19:10:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-12"}

This calls for further developments of the Skyrme functional in the spin\nchannel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jan 2020 20:11:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-22"}

In such emergency scenarios, it becomes very important for first aid\nresponders to communicate with other rescue teams in order to provide feedback\nto both the central office and the disaster survivors. To address this issue,\nrapidly deployable systems are required to re-establish connectivity and assist\nusers and first responders in the region of incident. In this work, we describe\nthe design, implementation, and evaluation of a rapidly deployable system for\nfirst response applications in post-disaster situations, named RDSP. The\nproposed system helps early rescue responders and victims by sharing their\nlocation information to remotely located servers by utilizing a novel routing\nscheme. This novel routing scheme consists of the Dynamic ID Assignment (DIA)\nalgorithm and the Minimum Maximum Neighbor (MMN) algorithm. The DIA algorithm\nis used by relay devices to dynamically select their IDs on the basis of all\nthe available IDs of networks. Whereas, the MMN algorithm is used by the client\nand relay devices to dynamically select their next neighbor relays for the\ntransmission of messages. The RDSP contains three devices; the client device\nsends the victim's location information to the server, the relay device relays\ninformation between client and server device, the server device receives\nmessages from the client device to alert the rescue team. We deployed and\nevaluated our system in the outdoor environment of the university campus. The\nexperimental results show that the RDSP system reduces the message delivery\ndelay and improves the message delivery ratio with lower communication\noverhead.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jan 2020 20:22:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-22"}

However, this process is time-consuming, labor-intensive, expensive\nand destructive to the specimen. Recently, the ability to virtually-stain\nunlabeled tissue sections, entirely avoiding the histochemical staining step,\nhas been demonstrated using tissue-stain specific deep neural networks. Here,\nwe present a new deep learning-based framework which generates\nvirtually-stained images using label-free tissue, where different stains are\nmerged following a micro-structure map defined by the user. This approach uses\na single deep neural network that receives two different sources of information\nat its input: (1) autofluorescence images of the label-free tissue sample, and\n(2) a digital staining matrix which represents the desired microscopic map of\ndifferent stains to be virtually generated at the same tissue section. This\ndigital staining matrix is also used to virtually blend existing stains,\ndigitally synthesizing new histological stains. We trained and blindly tested\nthis virtual-staining network using unlabeled kidney tissue sections to\ngenerate micro-structured combinations of Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E), Jones\nsilver stain, and Masson's Trichrome stain. Using a single network, this\napproach multiplexes virtual staining of label-free tissue with multiple types\nof stains and paves the way for synthesizing new digital histological stains\nthat can be created on the same tissue cross-section, which is currently not\nfeasible with standard histochemical staining methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 20 Jan 2020 22:14:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-08"}

Traditional spectral unmixing (SU) algorithms neglect the\nspectral variability of the endmembers, what propagates significant mismodeling\nerrors throughout the whole unmixing process and compromises the quality of its\nresults. Therefore, large efforts have been recently dedicated to mitigate the\neffects of spectral variability in SU.

Towards\nbringing a molecular-scale resolution to this problem, we present molecular\ndynamics (MD) simulations of $^1$H NMR relaxation and diffusion of heptane in a\npolymer matrix, where the high-viscosity polymer is a model for kerogen and\nbitumen that provides an organic \"surface\" for heptane. We calculate the\nautocorrelation function $G(t)$ for $^1$H-$^1$H dipole-dipole interactions of\nheptane in the polymer matrix and use this to generate the NMR frequency\n($f_0$) dependence of $T_1$ and $T_2$ relaxation times as a function of\n$\\phi_{C7}$. We find that increasing molecular confinement increases the\ncorrelation time of the heptane molecule, which decreases the surface\nrelaxation times for heptane in the polymer matrix. For weak confinement\n($\\phi_{C7} > 50$ vol%), we find that $T_{1S}/T_{2S} \\simeq 1$.

Considering its harmfulness to\nboth power grids and the public, several mechanized methods have been developed\nto automatically recognize electricity-theft behaviors. However, these methods,\nwhich mainly assess users' electricity usage records, can be insufficient due\nto the diversity of theft tactics and the irregularity of user behaviors.\n  In this paper, we propose to recognize electricity-theft behavior via\nmulti-source data. In addition to users' electricity usage records, we analyze\nuser behaviors by means of regional factors (non-technical loss) and climatic\nfactors (temperature) in the corresponding transformer area.

Simulation results show that properly modeling the spatial\ncorrelation and between-patient heterogeneity improves classification accuracy.\nApplication to in vivo data illustrates that classification is improved by\nspatial modeling using NNGP and reduced-rank approximation but not the CAR\nmodel, while modeling the between-patient heterogeneity does not further\nimprove our classifier.

Neural style transfer\nis a method of stylizing the contents of an image with the styles of another\nimage.

Previous studies on length-controllable abstractive summarization\nincorporate length embeddings in the decoder module for controlling the summary\nlength. Although the length embeddings can control where to stop decoding, they\ndo not decide which information should be included in the summary within the\nlength constraint.

Despite its minimal elements, many dynamical\nproperties of the DFHM are not well understood, owing to the complexity of\nsystems combining out-of-equilibrium behavior, interactions, and disorder in\nhigher spatial dimensions. Here, we study the relaxation dynamics of doubly\noccupied lattice sites in the three-dimensional (3D) DFHM using\ninteraction-quench measurements on a quantum simulator composed of fermionic\natoms confined in an optical lattice. In addition to observing the widely\nstudied effect of disorder inhibiting relaxation, we find that the cooperation\nbetween strong interactions and disorder also leads to the emergence of a\ndynamical regime characterized by \\textit{disorder-enhanced} relaxation. To\nsupport these results, we develop an approximate numerical method and a\nphenomenological model that each capture the essential physics of the decay\ndynamics.

Principled approaches to aid\nERM decision-making under uncertainty have been explored but have failed to be\naccepted into real systems. We identify a key issue impeding their adoption ---\nalgorithmic approaches to emergency response focus on reactive, post-incident\ndispatching actions, i.e. optimally dispatching a responder \\textit{after}\nincidents occur. However, the critical nature of emergency response dictates\nthat when an incident occurs, first responders always dispatch the closest\navailable responder to the incident. We argue that the crucial period of\nplanning for ERM systems is not post-incident, but between incidents. This is\nnot a trivial planning problem --- a major challenge with dynamically balancing\nthe spatial distribution of responders is the complexity of the problem. An\northogonal problem in ERM systems is planning under limited communication,\nwhich is particularly important in disaster scenarios that affect communication\nnetworks. We address both problems by proposing two partially decentralized\nmulti-agent planning algorithms that utilize heuristics and exploit the\nstructure of the dispatch problem.

While the time complexity for the\ninitialization of our approach is quadratic, the time complexity of each of its\niterations is linear in the size of the input knowledge graph.

Most prior work on cell-free massive\nMIMO systems assume time-division duplexing mode, although frequency-division\nduplexing (FDD) systems dominate current wireless standards. The key challenges\nin FDD massive MIMO systems are channel-state information (CSI) acquisition and\nfeedback overhead. To address these challenges, we exploit the so-called angle\nreciprocity of multipath components in the uplink and downlink, so that the\nrequired CSI acquisition overhead scales only with the number of served users,\nand not the number of AP antennas nor APs. We propose a low complexity\nmultipath component estimation technique and present linear angle-of-arrival\n(AoA)-based beamforming/combining schemes for FDD-based cell-free massive MIMO\nsystems. We analyze the performance of these schemes by deriving closed-form\nexpressions for the mean-square-error of the estimated multipath components, as\nwell as expressions for the uplink and downlink spectral efficiency. Using\nsemi-definite programming, we solve a max-min power allocation problem that\nmaximizes the minimum user rate under per-user power constraints. Furthermore,\nwe present a user-centric (UC) AP selection scheme in which each user chooses a\nsubset of APs to improve the overall energy efficiency of the system.\nSimulation results demonstrate that the proposed multipath component estimation\ntechnique outperforms conventional subspace-based and gradient-descent based\ntechniques.

For hot EHes this relationship with the cooler EHes,\nbased on their fluorine abundance is unexplored. We present in this paper the\nfirst abundance estimates of fluorine determined from singly ionised fluorine\nlines (F\\,{\\sc ii}) for 10 hot EHe stars from optical spectra. Fluorine\nabundances were determined using the F\\,{\\sc ii} lines in two windows centered\nat 3505 \\AA \\ and 3850 \\AA .

These fluorine abundances are compared with the other elemental\nabundances observed in these stars which provide an idea about the formation\nand evolution of these stars.

The OWPN channel is a discrete-time point-to-point\nchannel with a multi-sample receiver in which the channel output is affected by\nboth additive and multiplicative noise. The additive noise is a white standard\nGaussian process while the multiplicative noise is a Wiener phase noise\nprocess. This channel generalizes a number of channel models previously studied\nin the literature which investigate the effects of phase noise on the channel\ncapacity, such as the Wiener phase noise channel and the non-coherent channel.\nWe derive upper and inner bounds to the capacity of OWPN channel: (i) an upper\nbound is derived through the I-MMSE relationship by bounding the Fisher\ninformation when estimating a phase noise sample given the past channel outputs\nand phase noise realizations, then (ii) two inner bounds are shown: one relying\non coherent combining of the oversampled channel outputs and one relying on\nnon-coherent combining of the samples. After capacity, we study generalized\ndegrees of freedom (GDoF) of the OWPN channel for the case in which the\noversampling factor grows with the average transmit power $P$ as $P$? and the\nfrequency noise variance as $P^{\\alpha}$?. Using our new capacity bounds, we\nderive the GDoF region in three regimes: regime (i) in which the GDoF region\nequals that of the classic additive white Gaussian noise (for $\\beta \\leq 1$),\none (ii) in which GDoF region reduces to that of the non-coherent channel (for\n$\\beta \\geq \\min \\{\\alpha,1\\}$) and, finally, one in which partially-coherent\ncombining of the over-samples is asymptotically optimal (for $2 \\alpha-1\\leq\n\\beta \\leq 1$). Overall, our results are the first to identify the regimes in\nwhich different oversampling strategies are asymptotically optimal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jan 2020 12:41:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-22"}

Many of them are explored in OAD for the first time, and extensively\nevaluated with various hyper parameters. Furthermore, based on our\ncomprehensive study, we present several hybrid temporal modeling methods, which\noutperform the recent state-of-the-art methods with sizable margins on\nTHUMOS-14 and TVSeries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jan 2020 13:12:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-22"}

The INTEGRAL\nmonitoring campaign detected spectacular Eddington-limited X-ray flares, but\nalso rapid variations at much lower flux levels. On 2015 June 21 at 20 h 50\nmin, the 3-10 keV JEM-X data as well as simultaneous optical data started to\ndisplay a gradual brightening from one of these low-flux states. This was\nfollowed 15 min later by an order-of-magnitude increase of flux in the 20-40\nkeV IBIS/ISGRI light curve in just 15 s. The best-fitting model for both the\npre- and post-transition spectra required a Compton-thick partially covering\nabsorber.

We also investigate the relation of this\nobservable to gravitational memory, which is a permanent change of position of\ntest particles at infinity, after a gravitational wave passes completely from\nthem. It is shown that the BMS time coordinate is the physical time after a\ngravitational wave, and it is the legitimate time to be used to calculate the\nlight speed. Based on this argument, the analysis predicts a permanent change\nin the speed of light rays which propagate in asymptotics after a gravitational\nwave. Moreover, it is explained how this change is related to the gravitational\nmemory by comparing their significance in observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jan 2020 14:43:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Mar 2020 10:34:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 13 Jul 2021 08:33:34 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 3 Feb 2022 16:14:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-04"}

Magnetic reconnection plays a\nfundamental role in the energy release and conversion processes taking place\nduring flares. A common approach for investigating particle acceleration is to\nuse test particles in fields derived from magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations\nof reconnection. These MHD simulations use anomalous resistivities that are\nmuch larger than the Spitzer resistivity based on Coulomb collisions. The\nprocesses leading to enhanced resistivity should also affect the test\nparticles.

Pitch angle scattering widens collimated beams of orbit trajectories,\nallowing orbits to access previously unaccessible field lines; this causes\nfinal positions to spread to topological structures that were previously\ninaccessible.

Specifically, during the\nperiodic part of intermittency, the phase difference between the local heat\nrelease rate (HRR) measured from various burners show significant phase slips\nin time. During low amplitude TAI, there are fewer phase slips among the HRR\nresponse of the burners, which result in a state of weak synchronization among\nthe flames. During high amplitude TAI, we find that the flames are in perfect\nsynchrony amongst themselves and with the pressure fluctuations. We then\nquantify the degree of temporal and spatial synchronization between different\nflames, and flames and pressure fluctuations using the Kuramoto order parameter\nand the phase-locking value. We show that synchronization theory can be\nconveniently used to characterize and quantify flame-acoustic interactions in\nan annular combustor.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jan 2020 14:24:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 25 Jan 2020 06:46:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 18 May 2020 11:34:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-11"}

Despite\nits simplicity, this method fails to learn policies with low or even finite\ncost when there are few demonstrations. We propose to add an additional\nconstraint to policy fitting, that the policy is the solution to some LQR\nproblem, i.e., optimal in the stochastic control sense for some choice of\nquadratic cost.

To do\nso, counterfactual explanations exploit the properties of a particular data\npoint or sample, and as such are also local as well as partial explanations. We\nexplore how to move from local partial explanations to what we call complete\nlocal explanations and then to global ones. But to preserve accessibility we\nargue for the need for partiality. This partiality makes it possible to hide\nexplicit biases present in the algorithm that may be injurious or unfair.We\ninvestigate how easy it is to uncover these biases in providing complete and\nfair explanations by exploiting the structure of the set of counterfactuals\nproviding a complete local explanation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jan 2020 14:42:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 21 Aug 2021 08:55:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-24"}

However, the information disclosed through each request\nharms user privacy. This is a concern particularly with honest-but-curious LBS\nservers, which could, by collecting requests, track users and infer additional\nsensitive user data. This is the motivation of both centralized and\ndecentralized location privacy protection schemes for LBSs: anonymizing and\nobfuscating LBS queries to not disclose exact information, while still getting\nuseful responses. Decentralized schemes overcome the disadvantages of\ncentralized schemes, eliminating anonymizers and enhancing users' control over\nsensitive information. However, an insecure decentralized system could pose\neven more serious security threats than privacy leakage. We address exactly\nthis problem, by proposing security enhancements for mobile data sharing\nsystems. We protect user privacy while preserving accountability of user\nactivities, leveraging pseudonymous authentication with mainstream\ncryptography. Our design leverages architectures proposed for large scale\nmobile systems, while it incurs minimal changes to LBS servers as it can be\ndeployed in parallel to the LBS servers. This further motivates the adoption of\nour design, in order to cater to the needs of privacy-sensitive users.

The two output wavelengths from this laser can be\nselected individually using a linear polarizer. Second, by adjusting the\nQD-film thickness, we use higher-order transverse waveguide modes in the QD\nfilm to obtain dual-wavelength lasing at normal and off-normal angles from a\nsymmetric square array.

Following this rationale, this paper puts forth a general framework\nthat unifies state-of-the-art graph neural networks (GNNs) through the concept\nof EdgeNet. An EdgeNet is a GNN architecture that allows different nodes to use\ndifferent parameters to weigh the information of different neighbors.

Typically, prognostic CPMs are derived to predict the risk\nof a single future outcome. However, with rising emphasis on the prediction of\nmulti-morbidity, there is growing need for CPMs to simultaneously predict risks\nfor each of multiple future outcomes. A common approach to multi-outcome risk\nprediction is to derive a CPM for each outcome separately, then multiply the\npredicted risks. This approach is only valid if the outcomes are conditionally\nindependent given the covariates, and it fails to exploit the potential\nrelationships between the outcomes. This paper outlines several approaches that\ncould be used to develop prognostic CPMs for multiple outcomes. We consider\nfour methods, ranging in complexity and assumed conditional independence\nassumptions: namely, probabilistic classifier chain, multinomial logistic\nregression, multivariate logistic regression, and a Bayesian probit model.\nThese are compared with methods that rely on conditional independence: separate\nunivariate CPMs and stacked regression. Employing a simulation study and\nreal-world example via the MIMIC-III database, we illustrate that CPMs for\njoint risk prediction of multiple outcomes should only be derived using methods\nthat model the residual correlation between outcomes. In such a situation, our\nresults suggest that probabilistic classification chains, multinomial logistic\nregression or the Bayesian probit model are all appropriate choices. We call\ninto question the development of CPMs for each outcome in isolation when\nmultiple correlated or structurally related outcomes are of interest and\nrecommend more holistic risk prediction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jan 2020 15:57:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-29"}

Timely updating online map tiles\nfrom vector data, of which the generating is time-consuming, is a difficult\nmission. It is a shortcut to generate map tiles in time from remote sensing\nimages, which can be acquired timely without vector data. However, this mission\nused to be challenging or even impossible. Inspired by image-to-image\ntranslation (img2img) techniques based on generative adversarial networks\n(GAN), we proposed a semi-supervised Generation of styled map Tiles based on\nGenerative Adversarial Network (SMAPGAN) model to generate styled map tiles\ndirectly from remote sensing images. In this model, we designed a\nsemi-supervised learning strategy to pre-train SMAPGAN on rich unpaired samples\nand fine-tune it on limited paired samples in reality. We also designed image\ngradient L1 loss and image gradient structure loss to generate a styled map\ntile with global topological relationships and detailed edge curves of objects,\nwhich are important in cartography. Moreover, we proposed edge structural\nsimilarity index (ESSI) as a metric to evaluate the quality of topological\nconsistency between generated map tiles and ground truths. Experimental results\npresent that SMAPGAN outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) works according to\nmean squared error, structural similarity index, and ESSI. Also, SMAPGAN won\nmore approval than SOTA in the human perceptual test on the visual realism of\ncartography. Our work shows that SMAPGAN is potentially a new paradigm to\nproduce styled map tiles.

An important assumption of today's\nNear-field Communication (NFC) enabled cards is the limited communication range\nbetween the commercial reader and the NFC cards -- a distance below 5~cm.\nPrevious approaches to attacking this assumption effectively use mobile phones\nand active relays to enlarge the communication range, in order to attack the\nNFC cards. However, these approaches require a power supply at the adversary\nside, and can be easily localized when mobile phones or active relays transmit\nNFC signals.\n  We propose ReCoil, a system that uses wearable passive relays to attack NFC\ncards by expanding the communication range to 49.6 centimeters, a ten-fold\nimprovement over its intended commercial distance. ReCoil is a magnetically\ncoupled resonant wireless power transfer system, which optimizes the energy\ntransfer by searching the optimal geometry parameters. Specifically, we first\nnarrow down the feasible area reasonably and design the ReCoil-Ant Colony\nAlgorithm such that the relays absorb the maximum energy from the reader. In\norder to reroute the signal to pass over the surface of human body, we then\ndesign a half waist band by carefully analyzing the impact of the distance and\norientation between two coils on the mutual inductance. Then, three more coils\nare added to the system to keep enlarging the communication range. Finally,\nextensive experiment results validate our analysis, showing that our passive\nrelays composed of common copper wires and tunable capacitors expand the range\nof NFC attacks to 49.6 centimeters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jan 2020 04:50:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-23"}

The acknowledgment of the observable matter-filled universe necessitates\nreformulation of dynamics with total relativity.
