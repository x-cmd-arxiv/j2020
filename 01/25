Considering the low\nenergy model, we employ the Floquet-Kubo formalism to compute the thermal Hall\nand Nernst conductivities for both types of mWSMs. We show that the anisotropic\nnature of the dispersion for arbitrary integer monopole charge $n>1$ plays an\nimportant role in determining the effective Fermi surface behavior;\ninterestingly, one can observe momentum dependent corrections in Floquet mWSMs\nin addition to momentum independent contribution as observed for Floquet single\nWSMs. Apart from the non-trivial tuning of the Weyl node position $\\pm Q \\to\n\\pm Q- A_0^{2n}/\\omega$, our study reveals that the momentum independent terms\nresult in leading order contribution in the conductivity tensor. This has the\nform of $n$ times the single WSMs results with effective chemical potential\n$\\mu \\to \\mu -A_0^{2n}/\\omega$. On the other hand, momentum dependent\ncorrections lead to sub-leading order terms which are algebraic function of\n$\\mu$ and are present for $n>1$.

The aerodynamic and centrifugal forces\nbend the blade along its chord, varying the pitch angle by means of\nnon-consuming mechanisms. Here we introduce a general method based on a\nuniversal scaling, which finds the optimal soft materials for the blades to\nmaximize the overall turbine efficiency or rotational power, for any required\ngeometry of classical horizontal-axis turbines. The optimization problem, which\ndepends on various parameters, such as the wind velocity, the rotation rate,\nthe density, the rigidity and the geometry of the blade, is reduced to only two\ndimensionless parameters: the Cauchy number and the centrifugal number. The\nblade-element momentum theory is coupled to a torsion spring-based model for\nthe blade deformation. Taking into account realistic incoming wind-velocity\ndistributions in the North Sea and a large wind-turbine geometry, we found a\nsignificant increase of the total harvested power, up to +35%. In addition, the\noptimal soft material corresponding to the maximal efficiency over the entire\nworking range for a given wind turbine geometry is, within the limits of small\nblade deformations, scale-independent. Thus experiments on small wind turbines\nare a possible way to determine the optimal soft materials for larger ones.\nThese flexible blades are found to be between 5% and 20% lighter than the\ncurrent rigid blades.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jan 2020 16:16:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-27"}

Here we consider the question of the estimation of the Unruh\ntemperature in the scenario of relativistic quantum metrology. Specifically, we\nstudy two distinct cases. First, a single Unruh-DeWitt detector interacting\nwith a scalar quantum field undergoes an uniform acceleration for a finite\namount of proper time, and the role of coherence in the estimation process is\nanalyzed. After this, we consider two initially entangled detectors, one of\nwhich is inertial while the other one undergoes acceleration. Our results show\nthat the maximum of the Fisher information, thus characterizing the maximum\npossible precision according to Cramm\\'{e}r-Rao bound, occurs only for small\naccelerations, while it decreases fast when acceleration increases. Moreover,\nthe role of initial coherence ---in the single detector case---, or\nentanglement ---in the two detectors case---, is to decrease Fisher\ninformation. Therefore, under the considered protocol, internal coherence (or\nentanglement) is not a resource for estimating Unruh temperature. These\nunexpected results show that a detection of the Unruh effect can be even more\nchallenge than previously thought. Finally, by considering the connection\nbetween Unruh effect and Hawking radiation, we discuss how our results can be\nunderstood in the context of the estimation of Hawking temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jan 2020 16:51:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-27"}

The resulting\nerror estimator is then proved to be globally reliable and locally efficient.\nMoreover, the reliability and efficiency constants are independent of the jump\nof the diffusion coefficient regardless of its distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jan 2020 17:11:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-27"}

Our method is based\non an analysis of a set of photometric cuts perpendicular to the direction of a\nspiral arm. Based on the results of our study, we compare the main three\nclasses of spirals: grand design, multi-armed and flocculent.

Apart\nfrom these distinctive features, all three spiral classes do not differ\nsignificantly by their pitch angle, arm width, width asymmetry, and\nenvironment. Wavelength dependence is found only for the arm fraction.\nTherefore, observationally we find no strong difference (except for the view\nand number of arms) between grand design, multi-armed and flocculent spirals in\nthe sample galaxies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jan 2020 17:29:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-05"}

Critics argue that measuring the\ntemporal evolution of a network directly is better than measuring the degree\ndistribution when looking for preferential attachment. However, many of the\nestablished methods do not account for any potential time-dependence in the\nattachment kernels of growing networks, or methods assume that node degree is\nthe key observable determining network evolution. In this paper, we argue that\nthese assumptions may lead to misleading conclusions about the evolution of\ngrowing networks. We illustrate this by introducing a simple adaptation of the\nBarab{\\'a}si-Albert model, the \"k2 model\", where new nodes attach to nodes in\nthe existing network in proportion to the number of nodes one or two steps from\nthe target node. The k2 model results in time dependent degree distributions\nand attachment kernels, despite initially appearing to grow as linear\npreferential attachment, and without the need to include explicit time\ndependence in key network parameters (such as the average out-degree). We show\nthat similar effects are seen in several real world networks where constant\nnetwork growth rules do not describe their evolution. This implies that\nmeasurements of specific degree distributions in real networks are also likely\nto change over time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jan 2020 17:56:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 May 2020 10:17:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 14 May 2020 10:46:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

Theory and Methods: Spoiled gradient echoes can be\nused to estimate whole-brain maps of T1. This can be accomplished by using only\ntwo acquisitions with different flip angles, i.e., a DFA-based approach.\nAlthough DFA-based T1-mapping is seemingly straightforward to implement, it is\nsensitive to bias caused by incomplete spoiling and incidental magnetization\ntransfer (MT) effects. Further bias is introduced by the increased B0 and B1+\ninhomogeneities at 7T. Experiments were performed to determine the optimal flip\nangle pair and appropriate RF pulse shape and duration. Obtained T1 estimates\nwere validated using inversion recovery prepared EPI and compared to literature\nvalues. A multi-echo readout was used to increase SNR, enabling quantification\nof R2* and susceptibility, X. Results: Incomplete spoiling was observed above a\nlocal flip angle of approximately 20 degrees. An asymmetric gauss-filtered sinc\npulse with a constant duration of 700 us showed a sufficiently flat frequency\nresponse profile to avoid incomplete excitation in areas with high B0 offsets.\nA pulse duration of 700 us minimized effects from incidental MT. Conclusion:\nWhen performing DFA-based T1-mapping one should (i) limit the higher flip angle\nto avoid incomplete spoiling, (ii) use a RF pulse shape insensitive to B0\ninhomogeneities and (iii) apply a constant RF pulse duration, balanced to\nminimize incidental MT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jan 2020 19:12:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-28"}

The main novelty is the idea of using a Siamese convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN) to learn a distance function between a pair of video patches\n(spatio-temporal regions of video). The learned distance function, which is not\nspecific to the target video, is used to measure the distance between each\nvideo patch in the testing video and the video patches found in normal training\nvideo. If a testing video patch is not similar to any normal video patch then\nit must be anomalous.

Previous work has shown that infrared photons significantly\nincrease the quasiparticle density, yet even in the best isolated systems, it\nstill remains higher than expected, suggesting that another generation\nmechanism exists. In this Letter, we provide evidence that ionizing radiation\nfrom environmental radioactive materials and cosmic rays contributes to this\nobserved difference, leading to an elevated quasiparticle density that would\nultimately limit superconducting qubits of the type measured here to coherence\ntimes in the millisecond regime. We further demonstrate that introducing\nradiation shielding reduces the flux of ionizing radiation and positively\ncorrelates with increased coherence time.

Addressing\nthese limitations, the Large Scale Vertebrae Segmentation Challenge (VerSe) was\norganised in conjunction with the International Conference on Medical Image\nComputing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) in 2019 and 2020, with a\ncall for algorithms towards labelling and segmentation of vertebrae. Two\ndatasets containing a total of 374 multi-detector CT scans from 355 patients\nwere prepared and 4505 vertebrae have individually been annotated at\nvoxel-level by a human-machine hybrid algorithm (https://osf.io/nqjyw/,\nhttps://osf.io/t98fz/).

Although this approach\nis widely used and effective on many problems, there remain some practical\nissues with DSA preconditioning, particularly on highly heterogeneous domains.\nFor large-scale parallel simulation, it is critical that both (i)\npreconditioned source iteration converges rapidly, and (ii) the action of the\nDSA preconditioner can be applied using fast, scalable solvers, such as\nalgebraic multigrid (AMG). For heterogeneous domains, these two interests can\nbe at odds. In particular, there exist DSA diffusion discretizations that can\nbe solved rapidly using AMG, but they do not always yield robust/fast\nconvergence of the larger source iteration. Conversely, there exist robust DSA\ndiscretizations where source iteration converges rapidly on difficult\nheterogeneous problems, but fast parallel solvers like AMG tend to struggle\napplying the action of such operators. Moreover, very few current methods for\nthe solution of deterministic transport are compatible with voids. This paper\ndevelops a new heterogeneous DSA preconditioner based on only preconditioning\nthe optically thick subdomains. The resulting method proves robust on a variety\nof heterogeneous transport problems, including a linearized hohlraum mesh\nrelated to inertial confinement fusion. Moreover, the action of the\npreconditioner is easily computed using $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ AMG iterations,\n{convergence of the transport iteration typically requires $2-5\\times$ less\niterations than current state-of-the-art ``full DSA,'' and the proposed method\nis} trivially compatible with voids.

One promising learning paradigm is Active Learning (AL), by\nwhich the model intelligently selects instances to query the machine teacher\nfor labels. However, in current AL settings, the human-AI interface remains\nminimal and opaque. We begin considering AI explanations as a core element of\nthe human-AI interface for teaching machines.

Although the general theory\nof d-wave order was originally developed for materials displaying quadratic\nband touching, it directly applies to the case of semimetals with linear\ndispersion, several candidate compounds of which have been discovered\nexperimentally very recently. The spin-3/2 nature of the fermions allows for\nthe formation of spin-2 Cooper pairs which may be described by a complex\nsecond-rank tensor order parameter. In the case of linear dispersion, for the\nchemical potential at the Fermi point and at strong coupling, the energetically\npreferred superconducting state is the uniaxial nematic state, which preserves\ntime-reversal symmetry and provides a full (anisotropic) gap for quasiparticle\nexcitations.

For\nreward learning, inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) is a widely used\nparadigm. Given a Markov decision process (MDP) and a set of demonstrations for\na task, IRL learns a reward function that assigns a real-valued reward to each\nstate of the MDP. However, for temporally extended tasks, the underlying reward\nfunction may not be expressible as a function of individual states of the MDP.\nInstead, the history of visited states may need to be considered to determine\nthe reward at the current state. To address this issue, we propose an iterative\nalgorithm to learn a reward function for temporally extended tasks. At each\niteration, the algorithm alternates between two modules, a task inference\nmodule that infers the underlying task structure and a reward learning module\nthat uses the inferred task structure to learn a reward function. The task\ninference module produces a series of queries, where each query is a sequence\nof subgoals. The demonstrator provides a binary response to each query by\nattempting to execute it in the environment and observing the environment's\nfeedback. After the queries are answered, the task inference module returns an\nautomaton encoding its current hypothesis of the task structure. The reward\nlearning module augments the state space of the MDP with the states of the\nautomaton. The module then proceeds to learn a reward function over the\naugmented state space using a novel deep maximum entropy IRL algorithm. This\niterative process continues until it learns a reward function with satisfactory\nperformance. The experiments show that the proposed algorithm significantly\noutperforms several IRL baselines on temporally extended tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jan 2020 23:27:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 8 May 2020 00:32:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2020 16:38:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-14"}

To protect users' privacy, differential privacy has\nbeen widely studied in the literature. Specifically, a differentially private\nalgorithm adds noise to the true answer of a query to generate a noisy\nresponse. As a result, the information about the dataset leaked by the noisy\noutput is bounded by the privacy parameter. Oftentimes, a dataset needs to be\nused for answering multiple queries (e.g., for multiple analytics tasks), so\nthe level of privacy protection may degrade as more queries are answered. Thus,\nit is crucial to keep track of the privacy spending which should not exceed the\ngiven privacy budget. Moreover, if a query has been answered before and is\nasked again on the same dataset, we may reuse the previous noisy response for\nthe current query to save the privacy cost. In view of the above, we design and\nimplement a blockchain-based system for tracking and saving\ndifferential-privacy cost. Blockchain provides a distributed immutable ledger\nthat records each query's type, the noisy response used to answer each query,\nthe associated noise level added to the true query result, and the remaining\nprivacy budget in our system. Furthermore, since the blockchain records the\nnoisy response used to answer each query, we also design an algorithm to reuse\nprevious noisy response if the same query is asked repeatedly. Specifically,\nconsidering that different requests of the same query may have different\nprivacy requirements, our algorithm (via a rigorous proof) is able to set the\noptimal reuse fraction of the old noisy response and add new noise (if\nnecessary) to minimize the accumulated privacy cost. Experimental results show\nthat the proposed algorithm can reduce the privacy cost significantly without\ncompromising data accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Jan 2020 03:11:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Dec 2020 16:35:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-23"}

Several approaches found the aspect ratio of\nOumuamua to be unusually elongated. Moreover, the spin axis orientation has to\nbe almost perpendicular to the observer in order to obtain such an extreme\nlightcurve, a configuration which is unlikely. However, interstellar Oumuamua\nmay have different surface properties than we know in our solar system.\nTherefore, in this work we widen the parameter space for surface properties\nbeyond the asteroid-like models and study its effect on the lightcurve of\nOumuamua. We calculate reflection from a rotating ellipsoidal object for four\nmodels: Lambertian reflection, specular reflection, single scattering diffusive\nand backscatter. We then calculate the probability to obtain a lightcurve ratio\nlarger than the observed, as a function of the object aspect ratio, assuming an\nisotopic spin orientation distribution. We find the elongation of Oumuamua to\nbe less extreme for the Lambertian and specular reflection models.\nConsequently, the probability to observe the lightcurve ratio of Oumuamua given\nits unknown spin axis orientation is larger for those models. We conclude that\ndifferent surface reflection properties may suggest alternatives to the extreme\nshape of Oumuamua, relieving the need for complicated formation scenario,\nextreme albedo variation, or unnatural origin. Although the models suggested\nhere are for ideal ellipsoidal shape and ideal reflection method, the results\nemphasize the importance of surface properties for the derived aspect ratio.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Jan 2020 09:17:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-12"}

The proposed coding metasurface is composed of four different\ngraphene square patches in one layer, which has a distinct bias voltage. By\noptimizing the chemical potential of each patch, the reflection phase and\namplitude of a designed element can be controlled in a real-time manner. The\nchemical potential optimizing approach is a promising method to develop\nmetasurfaces, which can tune the reflection phase, magnitude, or polarization\ndynamically at different frequencies spectrum. Indeed, by adjusting the\nmetasurface reflection profile, the suggested device can manipulate the\nreflected wave. Also, this metasurface can reduce reflection energy in the\nwide-band spectrum. The programmable surface disperses reflected power in\nvarious directions in a first frequency band and converts incident\nelectromagnetic waves into heat at second frequency band. The obtained results\ndemonstrate that more than 10 dB reflection reduction can be realized over 1.02\nto 2.82 THz under both TE and TM polarized wave incidences. Due to the\nconformal properties of the graphene monolayer, the stealth feature of the\nmetasurface is well preserved while wrapping around a metallic curved object.\nThis optimization method has an excellent aptitude for phase, magnitude, and\npolarization control in various beamforming applications at the THz spectrum\nfor high-resolution imaging and stealth technology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Jan 2020 09:53:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-28"}

One important method of generating such terahertz pulses is\nto use the tilted-pulse-front (TPF) technique. However, due to the\nnon-collinear phase-matching, the large angular dispersion leads to a spatial\nand temporal break-up of the optical pump, limiting the terahertz generation\nefficiency and reducing the few-cycle character of the generated terahertz\nfields. To reduce the effects caused by angular dispersion, multiple schemes\nwith discrete pulse-front-tilt have been suggested.

In other words, the reward that\nthe agent receives is non-Markovian. One natural and quite general way to\nrepresent history-dependent rewards is via a Mealy machine; a finite state\nautomaton that produces output sequences (rewards in our case) from input\nsequences (state/action observations in our case). In our formal setting, we\nconsider a Markov decision process (MDP) that models the dynamic of the\nenvironment in which the agent evolves and a Mealy machine synchronised with\nthis MDP to formalise the non-Markovian reward function. While the MDP is known\nby the agent, the reward function is unknown from the agent and must be learnt.\n  Learning non-Markov reward functions is a challenge. Our approach to overcome\nthis challenging problem is a careful combination of the Angluin's L* active\nlearning algorithm to learn finite automata, testing techniques for\nestablishing conformance of finite model hypothesis and optimisation techniques\nfor computing optimal strategies in Markovian (immediate) reward MDPs. We also\nshow how our framework can be combined with classical heuristics such as Monte\nCarlo Tree Search. We illustrate our algorithms and a preliminary\nimplementation on two typical examples for AI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Jan 2020 10:51:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-28"}

A related question whether the extensions\nthat result in the process may be chosen in a linear or a continuous manner\nbetween appropriate spaces of functions turns out to be highly nontrivial. That\nthis holds for the class of continuous functions defined on metric spaces is\nthe well-known Borsuk-Dugundji theorem which asserts that given a metric space\nM and a subspace S of M, each continuous function g on S can be extended to a\ncontinuous function f on X such that the resulting assignment from C(S) to C(M)\nis a norm-one continuous linear extension operator.\n  The present paper is devoted to an investigation of this problem in the\ncontext of extendability of Lipschitz functions from closed subspaces of a\ngiven Banach space to the whole space such that the choice of the extended\nfunction gives rise to a bounded linear (extension) operator between\nappropriate spaces of Lipschitz functions. It is shown that the indicated\nproperty holds precisely when the underlying space is isomorphic to a Hilbert\nspace. Among certain useful consequences of this theorem, we provide an\nisomorphic analogue of a well-known theorem of S.

We compare the case of buildings\nwith a squared section with a configuration with slender buildings both in the\ncase of unit canyon width to height aspect ratio and in the case of AR = 2. The\nformer corresponds to skimming flow and the latter to wake-interference regime.\nMeasurements are performed in a water channel, measuring velocity on a vertical\nmid-plane using a particle image velocimetry technique. The mean flow, its\nsecond-order turbulence statistics, the exchange fluxes, and the integral time\nscales investigated, with results showing that slender buildings enhance\nturbulence production and yield longer integral time scales in the region just\nabove the building roof. The combined analysis of the turbulence production\nfields and the snapshots of the flow during sweep and ejection events\ndemonstrate that the shear layer between the canyon and the external flow is\nsignificantly more unstable with slender buildings, mainly because the damping\neffect of the vertical velocity fluctuations from the flat roof of the upwind\nbuilding is substantially missing. Consequently, a larger (downstream) portion\nof the interface is prone to the direct interaction of the external flow\nstructures. The higher turbulence intensity promotes the ventilation at the\ncanyon interface. In summary, the present experiments show that the effect of\nthe reduced building aspect ratio is particularly significant when the urban\ncanopy consists of narrow canyons. The result is of interest since narrow\nstreet canyons are typically bounded by slender buildings in the urban texture\nof the old European city centres.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Jan 2020 15:26:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-29"}

Though LTI\nsystem models provide accurate approximations for CPS such as autonomous\nvehicles at constant speed and turning radii, they are inaccurate for more\ncomplex motions such as lane changes, turns, and changes in velocity. Since\nthese more complex motions are more suitably described by linear time-varying\n(LTV) system models rather than LTI models, Dynamic Watermarking, which adds a\nprivate excitation to the input signal to validate measurements, has recently\nbeen extended to LTV systems. However, this extension does not allow for LTV\nsystems that require several steps before the effect of a given control input\ncan be seen in the measurement signal.

Furthermore, a proof of\nconcept was only provided using simulations of a simplified model.\n  This paper relaxes the requirement for inputs to be visible in a single step\nand constructs an auto-correlation normalizing factor to remove the effects of\nauto-correlation. In addition, Dynamic Watermarking is applied to a\nhigh-fidelity vehicle model in carsim and a 1/10 scale autonomous rover to\nfurther reinforce the proof of concept for realistic systems. In each case, the\nvehicle follows a predefined path with time-varying velocity and turning radii.\nA replay attack, which replays previously recorded measurements, is shown to be\ndetectable using LTV Dynamic Watermarking in a quick and repeatable manner.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jan 2020 18:36:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-28"}

In order to\nreduce the curtailment of renewable energy resources through improving the\noperational flexibility, a novel optimal scheduling model based on\nchance-constrained programming (CCP), aiming at minimizing the lowest\ngeneration cost, is proposed for a small-scale integrated energy system (IES)\nwith CHP units, thermal power units, renewable generations and representative\nauxiliary equipments. In this model, due to the uncertainties of renewable\ngenerations including wind turbines and photovoltaic units, the probabilistic\nspinning reserves are supplied in the form of chance-constrained; from the\nperspective of user experience, a heating load model is built with\nconsideration of heat comfort and inertia in buildings. To solve the model, a\nsolution approach based on sequence operation theory (SOT) is developed, where\nthe original CCP-based scheduling model is tackled into a solvable\nmixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation by converting a chance\nconstraint into its deterministic equivalence class, and thereby is solved via\nthe CPLEX solver. The simulation results on the modified IEEE 30-bus system\ndemonstrate that the presented method manages to improve operational\nflexibility of the IES with uncertain renewable generations by comprehensively\nleveraging thermal inertia of buildings and different kinds of auxiliary\nequipments, which provides a fundamental way for promoting renewable energy\nconsumption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Jan 2020 04:07:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-31"}

Mitigation of false triggers\nis an important aspect of building a privacy-centric non-intrusive smart\nassistant. In this paper, we address the task of false trigger mitigation (FTM)\nusing a novel approach based on analyzing automatic speech recognition (ASR)\nlattices using graph neural networks (GNN). The proposed approach uses the fact\nthat decoding lattice of a falsely triggered audio exhibits uncertainties in\nterms of many alternative paths and unexpected words on the lattice arcs as\ncompared to the lattice of a correctly triggered audio. A pure trigger-phrase\ndetector model doesn't fully utilize the intent of the user speech whereas by\nusing the complete decoding lattice of user audio, we can effectively mitigate\nspeech not intended for the smart assistant. We deploy two variants of GNNs in\nthis paper based on 1) graph convolution layers and 2) self-attention mechanism\nrespectively. Our experiments demonstrate that GNNs are highly accurate in FTM\ntask by mitigating ~87% of false triggers at 99% true positive rate (TPR).\nFurthermore, the proposed models are fast to train and efficient in parameter\nrequirements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Jan 2020 01:34:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-30"}

A corollary that follows\nis, in the linear limit, causation implies correlation, while correlation does\nnot imply causation. Now suppose there is an event $A$ taking a harmonic form\n(sine/cosine), and it generates through some process another event $B$ so that\n$B$ always lags $A$ by a phase of $\\pi/2$. Here the causality is obviously\nseen, while by computation the correlation is, however, zero. This seemingly\ncontradiction is rooted in the fact that a harmonic system always leaves a\nsingle point on the Poincar\\'e section; it does not add information. That is to\nsay, though the absolute information flow from $A$ to $B$ is zero, i.e.,\n$T_{A\\to B}=0$, the total information increase of $B$ is also zero, so the\nnormalized $T_{A\\to B}$, denoted as $\\tau_{A\\to B}$, takes the form of $\\frac 0\n0$. By slightly perturbating the system with some noise, solving a stochastic\ndifferential equation, and letting the perturbation go to zero, it can be shown\nthat $\\tau_{A\\to B}$ approaches 100\\%, just as one would have expected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 24 Jan 2020 16:29:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-30"}

Even though they thrive in simple\nsystems, they lack a way of representing higher-order entities and relations.\nThis is however needed in Frame Semantics, where semantic dependencies should\nbe able to connect groups of individuals and their properties, especially to\nmodel quantification. To answer this issue, this master report introduces\nwrappings as a way to envelop a sub-FS and treat it as a node. Following the\nwork of [Kallmeyer, Osswald 2013], we extend its syntax, semantics and some\nproperties (translation to FOL, subsumption, unification). We can then expand\nthe proposed pipeline. Lexical minimal model sets are generated from formulas.\nThey unify by FS value equations obtained by LTAG parsing to an underspecified\nsentence representation. The syntactic approach of quantifiers allows us to use\nexisting methods to produce any possible reading.

However, the size and\nmemory footprint of these large LMs makes them difficult to deploy in many\nscenarios (e.g. on mobile phones). Recent research points to knowledge\ndistillation as a potential solution, showing that when training data for a\ngiven task is abundant, it is possible to distill a large (teacher) LM into a\nsmall task-specific (student) network with minimal loss of performance.\nHowever, when such data is scarce, there remains a significant performance gap\nbetween large pretrained LMs and smaller task-specific models, even when\ntraining via distillation. In this paper, we bridge this gap with a novel\ntraining approach, called generation-distillation, that leverages large\nfinetuned LMs in two ways: (1) to generate new (unlabeled) training examples,\nand (2) to distill their knowledge into a small network using these examples.\nAcross three low-resource text classification datsets, we achieve comparable\nperformance to BERT while using 300x fewer parameters, and we outperform prior\napproaches to distillation for text classification while using 3x fewer\nparameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Jan 2020 08:20:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-04"}
