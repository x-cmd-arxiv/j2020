Recently, a homogeneous\nspatial network model was developed for studying spatial embedded networks with\ncharacteristic link length such as power-grids and the brain. However, although\nmany real-world networks are spatially embedded and their links have\ncharacteristics length such as pipelines, power lines or ground transportation\nlines they are not homogeneous but rather heterogeneous. For example, density\nof links within cities are significantly higher than between cities. Here we\npresent and study numerically and analytically a similar realistic\nheterogeneous spatial modular model using percolation process to better\nunderstand the effect of heterogeneity on such networks. The model assumes that\ninside a city there are many lines connecting different locations, while long\nlines between the cities are sparse and usually directly connecting only a few\nnearest neighbours cities in a two dimensional plane.

This kinetic\nequation contains modifications to the collision term in addition to a second\nterm that models the non-ideal contributions to the equation of state. An\nexplicit collision operator is derived in the semiclassical limit that is\nsimilar to that of the Uehling-Uhlenbeck equation, but where scattering is\nmediated by the potential of mean force (PMF). As a demonstration, we use this\ncollision integral to evaluate temperature and momentum relaxation rates in\ndense plasmas.

The putative high-mass binary BNS merger GW190425, for which no\nconfirmed EM counterpart has been identified, may be an example of such a\nsystem. It is thus important to understand how well we will be able to\ndistinguish high-mass BNSs and low-mass binary black holes (BBHs) solely from\ntheir GW signals. To do this, we consider the imprint of the tidal\ndeformability of the neutron stars on the GW signal for systems undergoing\nprompt black hole formation after merger. We model the BNS signals using hybrid\nnumerical relativity -- tidal effective-one-body waveforms. Specifically, we\nconsider a set of five nonspinning equal-mass BNS signals with masses of 2.7,\n3.0, 3.2 Msun and with three different equations of state, as well as the\nanalogous BBH signals. We perform parameter estimation on these signals in\nthree networks: Advanced LIGO-Advanced Virgo and Advanced LIGO-Advanced\nVirgo-KAGRA with sensitivities similar to O3 and O4, respectively, and a 3G\nnetwork of two Cosmic Explorers (CEs) and one Einstein Telescope, with a CE\nsensitivity similar to Stage 2.

Instead of solving partial differential equations (PDE) on a large\nscale, three alternative implicit ordinary differential equation (ODE)\nsimulation techniques are derived and discussed.

To recover regularity under such a\ncondition, two novel implicit ODE models are proposed, both with different\ntechniques for specifying boundary conditions.

In systems with long-range interactions, we rigorously\nestablish a hierarchy of linear light cones: at the same $\\alpha$, some quantum\ninformation processing tasks are constrained by a linear light cone while\nothers are not.

These bounds apply to\ntime-dependent systems and are optimal up to subalgebraic improvements.

A\nrevised prescription for AM transport by the magnetic Tayler instability has\nbeen recently proposed as a possible candidate for such a missing mechanism.\n  Results: The revised prescription for the transport by the Tayler instability\nleads to low core rotation rates after the main sequence that are in better\nglobal agreement with asteroseismic measurements than those predicted by models\nwith purely hydrodynamic processes or with the original Tayler-Spruit dynamo. A\ndetailed comparison with asteroseismic data shows that the rotational\nproperties of at most two of the six subgiants can be correctly reproduced by\nmodels accounting for this revised magnetic transport process. This result is\nobtained independently of the value adopted for the calibration parameter in\nthis prescription. We also find that this transport by the Tayler instability\nfaces difficulties in simultaneously reproducing asteroseismic measurements\navailable for subgiant and red giant stars. The low values of the calibration\nparameter needed to correctly reproduce the rotational properties of two of the\nsix subgiants lead to core rotation rates during the red giant phase that are\ntoo high. Inversely, the higher values of this parameter needed to reproduce\nthe core rotation rates of red giants lead to a very low degree of radial\ndifferential rotation before the red giant phase, which is in contradiction\nwith the internal rotation of subgiant stars.\n  Conclusions: In its present form, the revised prescription for the transport\nby the Tayler instability does not provide a complete solution to the missing\nAM transport revealed by asteroseismology of evolved stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jan 2020 19:10:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-05"}

Virtualisation technology such as network function virtualisation\n(NFV) allows for the creation of services by connecting component parts known\nas virtual network functions (VNFs).

The Transposition Distance Problem\n(TDP) aims to find the minimum number of transpositions required to transform\none chromosome into another, both represented as permutations. The TDP can be\nreduced to the problem of Sorting by Transpositions (SBT).\n  SBT is $\\mathcal{NP}$-hard and the best approximation algorithm with a\n$1.375$ ratio was proposed by Elias and Hartman. Their algorithm employs\nsimplification, a technique used to transform an input permutation $\\pi$ into a\nsimple permutation $\\hat{\\pi}$, presumably easier to handle with. The\npermutation $\\hat{\\pi}$ is obtained by inserting new symbols into $\\pi$ in a\nway that the lower bound of the transposition distance of $\\pi$ is kept on\n$\\hat{\\pi}$. The simplification is guaranteed to keep the lower bound, not the\ntransposition distance.\n  In this paper, we first show that the algorithm of Elias and Hartman (EH\nalgorithm) may require one extra transposition above the approximation ratio of\n$1.375$, depending on how the input permutation is simplified. Next, using an\nalgebraic approach, we propose a new upper bound for the transposition distance\nand a new $1.375$-approximation algorithm to solve SBT skipping simplification\nand ensuring the approximation ratio of $1.375$ for all $S_n$.\n  We implemented our algorithm and EH's. Regarding the implementation of the EH\nalgorithm, two issues needed to be fixed. We tested both algorithms against all\npermutations of size $n$, $2\\leq n \\leq 12$. The results show that the EH\nalgorithm exceeds the approximation ratio of $1.375$ for permutations with a\nsize greater than $7$.

However, averages, and especially means, can be strongly\naffected by outliers and can therefore give a misleading indication of the\n\"typical\" case. Recently, a number of studies have taken a step further by\nbinning their sample in terms of AGN power (approximated by the 2-10keV\nluminosity of the AGN), and investigating how the SFR distribution differs\nbetween these bins. These bin thresholds are often weakly motivated, and\nbinning implicitly assumes that sources within the same bin have similar (or\neven identical) properties. In this paper, we investigate whether the\ndistribution of host SFRs -- relative to the locus of the star-forming main\nsequence (i.e., $R_{\\rm MS}$) -- changes continuously as a function of AGN\npower. We achieve this by using a hierarchical Bayesian model that completely\nremoves the need to bin in AGN power. In doing so, we find strong evidence that\nthe $R_{\\rm MS}$ distribution changes with 2-10keV X-ray luminosity.

Additionally, we accommodate recursive feasibility in the\npresence of a-priori unknown constraints, which might render the reference\ntrajectory infeasible. In the proposed framework, constraint satisfaction is\nguaranteed at all times while the reference trajectory is tracked as good as\nconstraint satisfaction allows, thus simplifying the controller design and\nreducing possibly aggressive tracking behavior. The proposed framework is\nillustrated with three numerical examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Jan 2020 23:16:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Apr 2021 15:58:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-05"}

Interval SE models are regularly used, where true values of\nsystem states are supposed to be within the estimated ranges. However,\nconventional interval SE algorithms cannot consider the correlations of same\ninterval variables in different terms of constraints, which results in overly\nconservative estimation results. In this paper, we propose a Linear Programming\n(LP) Contractor algorithm that uses a relative distance measure (RDM) interval\noperation to solve this problem. In the proposed model, measurement errors are\nassumed to be bounded into given sets, thus converting the state variables to\nRDM variables.

Therefore, each nonlinear\nmeasurement equation in the model is transformed into dual inequality linear\nequations using the mean value theorem.

We regard RGB/optical flow videos as source modalities, skeletons\nas auxiliary modality. Our goal is to extract more discriminative features from\nsource modalities, with the help of auxiliary modality. Built on deep\nConvolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks,\nour model bridges data from source and auxiliary modalities by a modality\nadaptation block to achieve adaptive representation learning, that the network\nlearns to compensate for the loss of skeletons at test time and even at\ntraining time. We explore multiple adaptation schemes to narrow the distance\nbetween source and auxiliary modal distributions from different levels,\naccording to the alignment of source and auxiliary data in training. In\naddition, skeletons are only required in the training phase.

The imSitu dataset consists of images manually labeled with\nsemantic frame elements, mostly taken from FrameNet. Second, we propose a\nmultitask CNN-LSTM VQA model that learns to classify the answers as well as the\nsemantic frame elements. Our experiments show that semantic frame element\nclassification helps the VQA system avoid inconsistent responses and improves\nperformance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jan 2020 06:31:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-03"}

To address the issues, we propose a novel\nself-adversarial learning (SAL) paradigm for improving GANs' performance in\ntext generation. In contrast to standard GANs that use a binary classifier as\nits discriminator to predict whether a sample is real or generated, SAL employs\na comparative discriminator which is a pairwise classifier for comparing the\ntext quality between a pair of samples.

This dates back to Alan Turing's epoch-making\nwork in the early 1950s, which proposes that a machine's intelligence can be\ntested by how well it, the machine, can fool a human into believing that the\nmachine is a human through dialogue conversations. Many systems learn\ngeneration rules from a minimal set of authored rules or labels on top of\nhand-coded rules or templates, and thus are both expensive and difficult to\nextend to open-domain scenarios. Recently, the emergence of neural network\nmodels the potential to solve many of the problems in dialogue learning that\nearlier systems cannot tackle: the end-to-end neural frameworks offer the\npromise of scalability and language-independence, together with the ability to\ntrack the dialogue state and then mapping between states and dialogue actions\nin a way not possible with conventional systems. On the other hand, neural\nsystems bring about new challenges: they tend to output dull and generic\nresponses; they lack a consistent or a coherent persona; they are usually\noptimized through single-turn conversations and are incapable of handling the\nlong-term success of a conversation; and they are not able to take the\nadvantage of the interactions with humans. This dissertation attempts to tackle\nthese challenges: Contributions are two-fold: (1) we address new challenges\npresented by neural network models in open-domain dialogue generation systems;\n(2) we develop interactive question-answering dialogue systems by (a) giving\nthe agent the ability to ask questions and (b) training a conversation agent\nthrough interactions with humans in an online fashion, where a bot improves\nthrough communicating with humans and learning from the mistakes that it makes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jan 2020 08:28:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-03"}

We study boosting under the assumption that the weak hypotheses belong to\na class of bounded capacity. This assumption is inspired by the common\nconvention that weak hypotheses are \"rules-of-thumbs\" from an \"easy-to-learn\nclass\". (Schapire and Freund~'12, Shalev-Shwartz and Ben-David '14.) Formally,\nwe assume the class of weak hypotheses has a bounded VC dimension. We focus on\ntwo main questions: (i) Oracle Complexity: How many weak hypotheses are needed\nto produce an accurate hypothesis? We design a novel boosting algorithm and\ndemonstrate that it circumvents a classical lower bound by Freund and Schapire\n('95, '12). Whereas the lower bound shows that $\\Omega({1}/{\\gamma^2})$ weak\nhypotheses with $\\gamma$-margin are sometimes necessary, our new method\nrequires only $\\tilde{O}({1}/{\\gamma})$ weak hypothesis, provided that they\nbelong to a class of bounded VC dimension. Unlike previous boosting algorithms\nwhich aggregate the weak hypotheses by majority votes, the new boosting\nalgorithm uses more complex (\"deeper\") aggregation rules. We complement this\nresult by showing that complex aggregation rules are in fact necessary to\ncircumvent the aforementioned lower bound. (ii) Expressivity: Which tasks can\nbe learned by boosting weak hypotheses from a bounded VC class? Can complex\nconcepts that are \"far away\" from the class be learned? Towards answering the\nfirst question we {introduce combinatorial-geometric parameters which capture\nexpressivity in boosting.} As a corollary we provide an affirmative answer to\nthe second question for well-studied classes, including half-spaces and\ndecision stumps.

Here, some targets can be\nneutralized by a single robot, while others need multiple robots in a\nparticular sequence to neutralize them. The complexity in the problem arises\ndue to the scalability and information uncertainty, which restricts the robot's\nawareness of the swarm and the target distribution. In this paper, this problem\nis addressed by proposing a novel Context-Aware Deep Q-Network (CA-DQN)\nframework to obtain communication free cooperation between the robots in the\nswarm. Each robot maintains an adaptive grid representation of the vicinity\nwith the context information embedded into it to keep the swarm intact while\nsearching and neutralizing the targets. The problem formulation uses a\nreinforcement learning framework where two Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) handle\n'conflict' and 'conflict-free' scenarios separately. The self-play-in-based\napproach is used to determine the optimal policy for the DQNs. Monte-Carlo\nsimulations and comparison studies with a state-of-the-art coalition formation\nalgorithm are performed to verify the performance of CA-DQN with varying\nenvironmental parameters. The results show that the approach is invariant to\nthe number of detected targets and the number of robots in the swarm. The paper\nalso presents the real-time implementation of CA-DQN for different scenarios\nusing ground robots in a laboratory environment to demonstrate the working of\nCA-DQN with low-power computing devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jan 2020 08:50:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 2020 04:38:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-16"}

Also, we show that implicit ion models are relevant only to\nthe high electrostatic screening regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jan 2020 10:09:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-03"}

Here, we employ a recently\nproposed large-scale bi-directional generative adversarial network, called\nBigBiGAN, to decode and reconstruct natural scenes from fMRI patterns. BigBiGAN\nconverts images into a 120-dimensional latent space which encodes class and\nattribute information together, and can also reconstruct images based on their\nlatent vectors. We computed a linear mapping between fMRI data, acquired over\nimages from 150 different categories of ImageNet, and their corresponding\nBigBiGAN latent vectors. Then, we applied this mapping to the fMRI activity\npatterns obtained from 50 new test images from 50 unseen categories in order to\nretrieve their latent vectors, and reconstruct the corresponding images.\nPairwise image decoding from the predicted latent vectors was highly accurate\n(84%). Moreover, qualitative and quantitative assessments revealed that the\nresulting image reconstructions were visually plausible, successfully captured\nmany attributes of the original images, and had high perceptual similarity with\nthe original content. This method establishes a new state-of-the-art for\nfMRI-based natural image reconstruction, and can be flexibly updated to take\ninto account any future improvements in generative models of natural scene\nimages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jan 2020 10:46:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 17 May 2020 12:12:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 7 Dec 2020 20:15:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-09"}

These are modeled as continuum media with\nembedded elastic string heterogeneities, randomly located and randomly\noriented, which oscillate around a straight equilibrium position with a\nfundamental frequency depending on their length. The existence of a length\ndistribution reflects then in a distribution of oscillation frequencies which\nis responsible for the Boson Peak in the glass density of states. Previously,\nit has been shown that such a description can account for the elastic anomalies\nreported at frequencies comparable with the Boson Peak. Here we start from the\ngeneralized hydrodynamics to determine the dynamic correlation function\n$S(k,\\omega)$ associated with the coherent, dispersive and attenuated, sound\nwaves resulting from a sound-string interference. Once the vibrational density\nof states has been measured, we can use it for univocally fixing the string\nlength distribution inherent to a given glass. The density-density correlation\nfunction obtained using such distribution is strongly constrained, and able to\naccount for the experimental data collected on two prototypical glasses:\nglycerol and silica. The obtained string length distribution is compatible with\nthe typical size of elastic heterogeneities previously reported for silica and\nsupercooled liquids, and the atomic motion associated to the string dynamics is\nconsistent with the soft modes recently identified in large scale numerical\nsimulations as non-phonon modes responsible for the Boson Peak. The theory is\nthus in agreement with the most recent advances in the understanding of the\nglass specific dynamics and offers an appealing simple understanding of the\nmicroscopic origin of the latter, while raising new questions on the\nuniversality or material-specificity of the string distribution properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jan 2020 12:31:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-27"}

We show that this\ndownward propagation causes the flux tube to act as an isolated source,\ncreating a characteristic surface wavefield. Measuring this wavefield at the\nsurface reveals subsurface properties of the magnetic field topology. Using\ntime distance helioseismology, we demonstrate how to detect such a flux tube\nsignal based on a group travel-time delay of $\\varDelta t = 282.6$ sec due to\nthe wave packet spending time subsurface as a slow mode wave. Although the\namplitude is small and generally superimposed by the full wave field, it can be\ndetected if assumptions about $\\varDelta t$ are made. We demonstrate this for a\nsimulation with solar like sources. This kind of study has the potential to\nreveal subsurface information of sunspots based on the analysis of a surface\nsignal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jan 2020 12:45:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-03"}

Reconfiguration of\nthe overlay is done with RapidWright which allows to bypass the HDL design\nflow. Through prototyping, we demonstrated the viability and relevance of our\napproach.

At equilibrium, product\ndiscrimination, the selective formation of a \"correct\" product with respect to\nan \"incorrect product\", is fundamentally limited by the free energy difference\nbetween the two products. However, biological systems often far exceed this\nlimit, by using discriminatory networks that expend free energy to maintain\nnon-equilibrium steady states. Non-equilibrium systems are notoriously\ndifficult to analyze and no systematic methods exist for determining parameter\nregimes which maximize discrimination. Here we introduce a measure that can be\ncomputed directly from the biochemical rate constants and which provides a\nnecessary condition for proofreading. Non-equilibrium systems can discriminate\nusing binding energy (energetic) differences or using activation energy\n(kinetic) differences, but in both cases, proofreading is optimal when\ndissipation is maximized, so long as the necessary condition we introduce is\nsatisfied. We show that these constraints can be in opposition and that this\nexplains why the error rate is a non-monotonic function of the irreversible\ndrive in the original proofreading scheme of Hopfield and Ninio. Finally, we\nintroduce mixed networks, in which one product is favored energetically and the\nother kinetically. In such networks, sensitive product switching can be\nachieved simply by spending free energy.

Here we use large-eddy\nsimulations to study the effect of LLJ height on the flow dynamics in a wind\nfarm with $10\\times4$ turbines. We change the LLJ height and atmospheric\nthermal stratification by varying the surface cooling rate. We find that the\nfirst row power production is higher in the presence of a LLJ compared to a\nneutral reference case without LLJ. Besides, we show that the first row power\nproduction increases with decreasing LLJ height. Due to the higher turbulence\nintensity, the wind turbine wakes recover faster in a neutral boundary layer\nthan in a stably stratified one. However, for strong thermal stratification\nwith a low-height LLJ, the wake recovery can be faster than for the neutral\nreference case as energy can be entrained from the LLJ. Flow visualizations\nreveal that under stable stratification the growth of wind farm's internal\nboundary layer is restricted and the wind flows around the wind farm. Wind\nfarms extract energy from LLJs through wake meandering and turbulent\nentrainment depending on the LLJ height. Both effects are advantageous for wake\nrecovery, which is beneficial for the performance of downwind turbines. This\nfinding is confirmed by an energy budget analysis, which reveals a significant\nincrease in the kinetic energy flux in the presence of a LLJ. The jet strength\nreduces as it passes through consecutive turbine rows. For strong\nstratification, the combined effect of buoyancy destruction and turbulence\ndissipation is larger than the turbulent entrainment. Therefore, the power\nproduction of turbines in the back of the wind farm is relatively low for\nstrong atmospheric stratifications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jan 2020 15:49:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 22 Apr 2020 19:51:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 11 Dec 2020 11:22:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-20"}

It is assumed that the\npiezoelectric part of the active carrier may be actuated as a bi-sectional body\n(i.e., two continuous hemispherical parts), with prescribed phase difference,\nand the polar position of the imaginary separating plane may be altered. This\nissue brings about an asymmetry in the dynamics of the problem which leads to\nemergence of position/frequency dependent acoustic radiation torque. It is\nobtained that as the carrier is excited by imposing harmonic voltage with the\nsame amplitude and a $\\pi$-radians phase difference,the zero-radiation force\nsituation is obtained for a specific amplitude and phase of voltage as a\nfunction of frequency. This situation is treated as a criterion to determine\nthe optimal amplitude of operation voltage. It is shown that the net force's\ndirection exerted on the activated carrier may be steered along any desired\norientation, assuming the fixed direction of the incident wave field. The\nexplained method of excitation and controllability of the spatial position of\nthe divisor plane can possibly be a breakthrough in acoustic handling of active\ncarriers.

A maskless and very flexible structuring\nprocess is offered by ablation using ultra-short pulse laser irradiation.\nUsually, certain areas of a functional thin film coating are locally removed to\nyield the needed device structures. Micro laser patterning quality is not only\ninfluenced by the beam properties (beam profile, fluence) but also by pulse\noverlap, scan repetitions and many other factors such as substrate and coating\nmaterial. This makes process parameter optimization a challenging task. In this\npaper, we present a systematic approach to efficiently find suitable parameters\nfor laser-induced ablation of thin films on susceptible polymer substrates. As\nan example, we use a sputtered NiCr coating with a thickness of 100 $nm$ on a\npolyimide film made by spin coating of PI-2611 precursor (@ 2000 $rpm$ > ca. 8\n${\\mu}m$, HD microsystems).

To propagate the state of the atmosphere forward in time, a non-linear\nequation for the prognostic variables has to be solved at every timestep.

The model uses an advanced mimetic\nfinite element discretisation which makes the construction of efficient solvers\nchallenging compared to models using standard finite-difference and\nfinite-volume methods. The linear solver hinges on a bespoke multigrid\npreconditioner of the Schur-complement system for the pressure correction. By\ncomparing to Krylov-subspace methods, the superior performance and robustness\nof the multigrid algorithm is demonstrated for standard test cases and\nrealistic model setups. In production mode, the model will have to run in\nparallel on 100,000s of processing elements. As confirmed by numerical\nexperiments, one particular advantage of the multigrid solver is its excellent\nparallel scalability due to avoiding expensive global reduction operations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jan 2020 11:16:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Jul 2020 11:09:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-30"}

However, large public fisheye datasets are not available, and\nthe fisheye images captured by the fisheye camera with large FoV comes with\nlarge distortion, so commonly-used semantic segmentation model cannot be\ndirectly utilized.

In this paper, we construct an\ninterpretable AnchorNet equipped with our carefully designed RFs and linearly\nspatial aggregation to provide patch-wise interpretability of the input media\nmeanwhile localizing multi-scale informative patches only supervised on\nmedia-level labels without any extra bounding box annotations. Visualization of\nlocalized informative image and text patches show the superior multi-scale\nlocalization capability of AnchorNet. We further use localized patches for\ndownstream classification tasks across widely applied networks. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that replacing the original inputs with their patches for\nclassification can get a clear inference acceleration with only tiny\nperformance degradation, which proves that localized patches can indeed retain\nthe most semantics and evidences of the original inputs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jan 2020 10:04:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 17 Apr 2020 08:14:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-20"}

It is argued that creativity arises from a synergy\nbetween two cognitive modes of the human brain (which broadly coincide with\nKahneman's Systems 1 and 2). In the first, available energy is spread across a\nrelatively large network of neurons. As such, the amount of energy per active\nneuron is so small that the operation of such neurons is susceptible to thermal\n(ultimately quantum decoherent) noise. In the second, available energy is\nfocussed on a small enough subset of neurons to guarantee a deterministic\noperation. An illustration of how this synergy can lead to creativity with\nimplications for computing in silicon are discussed. Starting with a discussion\nof the concept of free will, the notion of consciousness is defined in terms of\nan awareness of what are perceived to be nearby counterfactual worlds in state\nspace. It is argued that such awareness arises from an interplay between our\nmemories on the one hand, and quantum physical mechanisms (where, unlike in\nclassical physics, nearby counterfactual worlds play an indispensable dynamical\nrole) in the ion channels of neural networks. As with the brain's\nsusceptibility to noise, it is argued that in situations where quantum physics\nplays a role in the brain, it does so for reasons of energy efficiency. As an\nillustration of this definition of consciousness, a novel proposal is outlined\nas to why quantum entanglement appears so counter-intuitive.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 31 Jan 2020 09:12:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-22"}

In this paper, we\nconsider the task as a problem of computing similarity between video shots and\nquery. To this end, we propose a method, named Convolutional Hierarchical\nAttention Network (CHAN), which consists of two parts: feature encoding network\nand query-relevance computing module. In the encoding network, we employ a\nconvolutional network with local self-attention mechanism and query-aware\nglobal attention mechanism to learns visual information of each shot. The\nencoded features will be sent to query-relevance computing module to generate\nqueryfocused video summary.

Smart grids provide energy in\ndifferent crowded sectors with the efficient and timely transmission of\nelectricity. But the traditional power grids follow a centralized approach for\nenergy transactions with a large number of growing connections and become more\nchallenging to handle power disturbance in the grid.
