We investigate\nhow the X-ray emissivity of fainter X-ray binaries (principally CVs and\ncoronally active binaries) varies between different environments. We compile\ncalculations (largely from the literature) of the X-ray emissivity of old\nstellar populations, including open and globular clusters and several galaxies.\nWe investigate three literature claims of unusual X-ray sources in low-density\nstellar populations. We show that a suggested quiescent neutron star in the\nopen cluster NGC 6819 is a foreground M dwarf. We show that the suggested\ndiffuse X-ray emission from an old nova shell in the globular cluster NGC 6366\nis actually a background galaxy cluster. And we show that a suggested\npopulation of quiescent X-ray binaries in the Sculptor Dwarf Galaxy is mostly\n(perhaps entirely) background galaxies. We find that above densities of $10^4$\nM$_{\\odot}$/pc$^3$, the X-ray emissivity of globular clusters increases, due to\ndynamical production of X-ray emitting systems. Below this density, globular\nclusters have lower X-ray emissivity than the other populations, and we do not\nsee a strong dependence of X-ray emissivity due to density effects. We find\nsignificant correlations between X-ray emissivity and binary fraction,\nmetallicity, and density. Sampling these fits via bootstrap techniques gives\nless significant correlations, but confirms the effect of metallicity on\nlow-density populations, and that of density on the full globular cluster\nsample.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Jan 2020 16:04:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-05"}

In\nthis work, we develop a lopsided loss function based on entropy regularization\nthat assumes the existence of a nontrivial false negative rate in the target\nannotations.

Graphene membranes are used\nto pump gases through nanopores using optothermal forces. By monitoring the\ntime delay between the actuation force and the membrane mechanical motion, the\npermeation time-constants of various gases are shown to be significantly\ndifferent. The measured linear relation between the effusion time constant and\nthe square root of the molecular mass provides a method for sensing gases based\non their molecular mass. The presented microscopic effusion based gas sensor\ncan provide a small, low-power alternative for large, high-power,\nmass-spectrometry and optical spectrometry based gas sensing methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Jan 2020 20:17:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-28"}

One possible limit distribution of partial maxima of samples\nfrom such a Markov tree is a max-stable H\\\"usler-Reiss distribution whose\nparameter matrix inherits its structure from the tree, each edge contributing\none free dependence parameter. Our central assumption is that, upon marginal\nstandardization, the data-generating distribution is in the max-domain of\nattraction of the said H\\\"usler-Reiss distribution, an assumption much weaker\nthan the one that data are generated according to a graphical model. Even if\nsome of the variables are unobservable (latent), we show that the underlying\nmodel parameters are still identifiable if and only if every node corresponding\nto a latent variable has degree at least three. Three estimation procedures,\nbased on the method of moments, maximum composite likelihood, and pairwise\nextremal coefficients, are proposed for usage on multivariate peaks over\nthresholds data when some variables are latent. A typical application is a\nriver network in the form of a tree where, on some locations, no data are\navailable. We illustrate the model and the identifiability criterion on a data\nset of high water levels on the Seine, France, with two latent variables. The\nstructured H\\\"usler-Reiss distribution is found to fit the observed extremal\ndependence patterns well. The parameters being identifiable we are able to\nquantify tail dependence between locations for which there are no data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Jan 2020 20:18:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 17 Jan 2021 18:16:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-19"}

In current work, we performed quantum chemistry\ncalculations to address binding strength and coordination structures of chiral\nbis(mandelato)borate ([BMB]) anions with representative alkali metal ions, as\nwell as electronic properties of alkali metal ion-[BMB] ion pair complexes. The\noptimized [BMB] conformers are categorized into V-shaped, bent, and twisted\nstructures with varied electrostatic potential contours, conformational\nenergies, and distinct alkali metal ion-[BMB] binding structures. Alkali metal\nions have additional associations with phenyl groups in V-shaped [BMB]\nconformers owing to preferential cation-$\\pi$ interactions.

Oxygen atoms in [BMB] anions have\ncompetitive hydrogen bonding interactions with hydrogen atoms in cations\ndepending on molecular chiralities and steric hindrance effects of [BMB]\nanions. However, molecular chiralities of [BMB] anions have negligible effect\non liquid densities of tetraalkylphosphonium [BMB] ILs and spatial\ndistributions of boron atoms in anions around phosphorous atoms in cations.\nEnlarging tetraalkylphosphonium cation sizes leads to enhanced cation-anion\nhydrogen bonding and Coulombic interactions due to enhanced segregation of\npolar groups in apolar networks in heterogeneous IL matrices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Jan 2020 20:43:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-29"}

The pose\nrepresentation should capture a set of consistent and tightly localized\nlandmarks in order to facilitate reconstruction of the input image. Ultimately,\nwe wish for our learned landmarks to focus on the foreground object of\ninterest.

Enormous efforts have been made on constructing taxonomies\neither manually or semi-automatically. However, with the fast-growing volume of\nweb content, existing taxonomies will become outdated and fail to capture\nemerging knowledge. Therefore, in many applications, dynamic expansions of an\nexisting taxonomy are in great demand. In this paper, we study how to expand an\nexisting taxonomy by adding a set of new concepts. We propose a novel\nself-supervised framework, named TaxoExpan, which automatically generates a set\nof <query concept, anchor concept> pairs from the existing taxonomy as training\ndata. Using such self-supervision data, TaxoExpan learns a model to predict\nwhether a query concept is the direct hyponym of an anchor concept. We develop\ntwo innovative techniques in TaxoExpan: (1) a position-enhanced graph neural\nnetwork that encodes the local structure of an anchor concept in the existing\ntaxonomy, and (2) a noise-robust training objective that enables the learned\nmodel to be insensitive to the label noise in the self-supervision data.\nExtensive experiments on three large-scale datasets from different domains\ndemonstrate both the effectiveness and the efficiency of TaxoExpan for taxonomy\nexpansion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Jan 2020 21:30:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-28"}

Such intricate interplays between magnetism and crystalline\nstructures provide ample opportunities for exploring quantum phase transitions\nin this new 2D parameter regime. Here, using magnetic field and temperature\ndependent circularly polarized Raman spectroscopy of phonons and magnons, we\nmap out the phase diagram of CrI3 that has been known to be a layered AFM in\nits 2D films and a FM in its 3D bulk. We, however, reveal a novel mixed state\nof layered AFM and FM in 3D CrI3 bulk crystals where the layered AFM survives\nin the surface layers and the FM appears in deeper bulk layers. We then show\nthat the surface layered AFM transits into the FM at a critical magnetic field\nof 2 T, similar to what was found in the few layer case. Interestingly,\nconcurrent with this magnetic phase transition, we discover a first-order\nstructural phase transition that alters the crystallographic point group from\nC3i to C2h and thus, from a symmetry perspective, this monoclinic structural\nphase belongs to the 3D nematic order universality class.

Thus, in case of an unauthorized distribution of their personal\ndata by these service providers (or in case of a data breach) data owners want\nto identify the source of such data leakage. Digital fingerprinting schemes\nhave been developed to embed a hidden and unique fingerprint into shared\ndigital content, especially multimedia, to provide such liability guarantees.\nHowever, existing techniques utilize the high redundancy in the content, which\nis typically not included in personal data. In this work, we propose a\nprobabilistic fingerprinting scheme that efficiently generates the fingerprint\nby considering a fingerprinting probability (to keep the data utility high) and\npublicly known inherent correlations between data points. To improve the\nrobustness of the proposed scheme against colluding malicious service\nproviders, we also utilize the Boneh-Shaw fingerprinting codes as a part of the\nproposed scheme.

The problem\nis motivated by the automatic polishing of an object. Due to the non-bijective\nmapping between the workspace and the joint-space, a continuous coverage path\nin the workspace may easily be truncated in the joint-space, incuring\nundesirable end effector lift-offs. Inversely, there may be multiple\nconfiguration choices to cover the same point of a coverage path through the\nsolution of the Inverse Kinematics. The solution departs from the conventional\nlocal optimisation of the coverage path shape in task space, or choosing\nappropriate but possibly disconnected configurations, to instead explicitly\nexplore the leaast number of discontinuous motions through the analysis of the\nstructure of valid configurations in joint-space. The two novel contributions\nof this paper include proof that the least number of path discontinuities is\npredicated on the surrounding environment, independent from the choice of the\nactual coverage path; thus has a minimum.

A recent method for\nascertaining such an attribution is via the game theoretic Shapley value\ndecomposition of the coefficient of determination. Such a decomposition has the\ndesirable efficiency, monotonicity, and equal treatment properties.

Here, we focus on the observation that the timing of\nself-initiated actions shows large variability even when they are executed in\nstable, well-learned sequences. Could this mix of reliability and stochasticity\narise within the same circuit? We trained rats to perform a stereotyped\nsequence of self-initiated actions and recorded neural ensemble activity in\nsecondary motor cortex (M2), which is known to reflect trial-by-trial action\ntiming fluctuations. Using hidden Markov models we established a robust and\naccurate dictionary between ensemble activity patterns and actions.

This mechanism predicted a\nspecific structure of low-dimensional noise correlations that were empirically\nverified in M2 ensemble dynamics.

This can lead to many financial losses, or serious injuries, even\ndeaths. The motivation behind this paper is that we emphasize this issue and\nwant to raise awareness. Therefore, the security gap of mammographic image\nclassifier against adversarial attack is demonstrated. We use mamographic\nimages to train our model then evaluate our model performance in terms of\naccuracy. Later on, we poison original dataset and generate adversarial samples\nthat missclassified by the model. We then using structural similarity index\n(SSIM) analyze similarity between clean images and adversarial images. Finally,\nwe show how successful we are to misuse by using different poisoning factors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jan 2020 07:37:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-28"}

This classification\nproblem is fundamental as it also establishes analytical and numerical\nfoundations for studying complex temporal behaviours in multiple timescale\nmodels. This manuscript begins by reviewing the seminal works of Rinzel and\nIzhikevich in classifying bursting patterns of excitable cell models. Moreover,\nwe recall an alternative, yet complementary, mathematical classification\napproach by Golubitsky, which together with the Rinzel-Izhikevich proposals\nprovide the state-of-the-art foundations to the classification problem.\nUnexpectedly, while keeping within the Rinzel-Izhikevich framework, we find\nnovel cases of bursting mechanisms not considered before. Moving beyond the\nstate-of-the-art, we identify novel bursting mechanisms that fall outside the\ncurrent classifications. This leads us towards a new classification, which\nrequires the analysis of both the fast and the slow subsystems of an underlying\nslow-fast model. This new classification allows the dynamical dissection of a\nlarger class of bursters. To substantiate this, we add a new class of bursters\nwith at least two slow variables, which we denote folded-node bursters, to\nconvey the idea that the bursts are initiated or annihilated via a folded-node\nsingularity. In fact, there are two main families of folded-node bursters,\ndepending upon the phase of the bursting cycle during which folded-node\ndynamics occurs. If it occurs during the silent phase, we obtain the classical\nfolded-node bursting (or simply folded-node bursting). If it occurs during the\nactive phase, we have cyclic folded-node bursting. We classify both families\nand give examples of minimal systems displaying these novel types of bursting\nbehaviour.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jan 2020 08:32:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-28"}

However, past research has pointed to this lack of\ncustomizability as a severe limiting issue in SA. Accordingly, in this paper,\nwe propose an approach called Ammonia, which is based on statically analyzing\nchanges across the development history of a project, as a means to identify\nproject-specific bug patterns.

The results obtained show that our tool could detect 19 project\nspecific bug patterns across those four projects.

In this paper,\nwe introduce two novel ABCS algorithms that are suitable for compressively\nsensing images or intra-coded video frames. Both use deterministic 2D-DCT\ndictionaries when sensing the images instead of random dictionaries. The first\nuses a low number of compressive measurements to compute the block boundary\nvariation (BBV) around each image block, from which it estimates the number of\n2D-DCT transform coefficients to measure from each block. The second uses a low\nnumber of DCT domain (DD) measurements to estimate the total number of\ntransform coefficients to capture from each block. The two algorithms permit\nreconstruction in real time, averaging 8 ms and 26 ms for 256x256 and 512x512\ngreyscale images, respectively, using a simple inverse 2D-DCT operation without\nrequiring GPU acceleration.

For the first application, we show how to\nencode low-level details such as stack size in the language semantics and how\nto prove equivalence between two programs operating at different levels of\nabstraction.

After summarizing key findings,\nincluding the mapping of the ASEP to quantum spin chains, we discuss the\nrecently introduced Brownian asymmetric simple exclusion process (BASEP) as a\nrelated class of driven diffusive system with continuous space dynamics. In the\nBASEP, driven Brownian motion of hardcore-interacting particles through\none-dimensional periodic potentials is considered. We study whether\ncurrent-density relations of the BASEP can be considered as generic for\narbitrary periodic potentials and whether repulsive particle interactions other\nthan hardcore lead to similar results. Our findings suggest that shapes of\ncurrent-density relations are generic for single-well periodic potentials and\ncan always be attributed to the interplay of a barrier reduction, blocking and\nexchange symmetry effect. This implies that in general up to five different\nphases of nonequilibrium steady states are possible for such potentials. The\nphases can occur in systems coupled to particle reservoirs, where the bulk\ndensity is the order parameter. For multiple-well periodic potentials, more\ncomplex current-density relations are possible and more phases can appear.\nTaking a repulsive Yukawa potential as an example, we show that the effects of\nbarrier reduction and blocking on the current are also present.

The main advantage of this\napproach is its computational efficiency, even in high dimensional problems.\nHence, RL can be used to estimate numerically the feedback capacity of unifilar\nfinite state channels (FSCs) with large alphabet size. The outcome of the RL\nalgorithm sheds light on the properties of the optimal decision rule, which in\nour case, is the optimal input distribution of the channel.

Material and Methods: We used data from de-identified EHRs of\nthree mental health trusts in the UK (>50 million documents, over 500,000\npatients, 2835 of which were prescribed Clozapine). We explored the prevalence\nof 33 adverse effects by age, gender, ethnicity, smoking status and admission\ntype three months before and after the patients started Clozapine treatment.

Many social and economic barriers have proved to play a crucial\nrole in this process, ranging from level of education, environmental awareness,\nage and census. This work aims at contributing to the study of this adoption\nprocess through a data-based lens, using real mobility patterns to setup a\nsocial-network analysis to model the spread of consensus among neighbouring\npeople that can enable the switch to EVs. In particular, we build the network\ntopology using proximity measures that emerge from the analysis of real trips,\nand the initial disposition of the single agents towards the EV technology is\ninferred from their real mobility patterns.

The optimal\nway to access these rare events is by means of an auxiliary dynamics obtained\nfrom the original one through the so-called ``generalised Doob\ntransformation''. While this optimal dynamics is guaranteed to exist its use is\noften impractical, as to define it requires the often impossible task of\ndiagonalising a (tilted) dynamical generator. While approximate schemes have\nbeen devised to overcome this issue they are difficult to automate as they tend\nto require knowledge of the systems under study. Here we address this problem\nfrom the perspective of deep learning. We devise an iterative semi-supervised\nlearning scheme which converges to the optimal or Doob dynamics with the clear\nadvantage of requiring no prior knowledge of the system. We test our method in\na paradigmatic statistical mechanics model with non-trivial dynamical\nfluctuations, the fully packed classical dimer model on the square lattice,\nshowing that it compares favourably with more traditional approaches.

A detailed multi-colour light curve was gathered with\nPan-STARRS1 and follow-up spectroscopy was obtained with the NOT and\nGemini-North. The spectra near maximum light show narrow features at low\nvelocities of 3000 to 4000 km s$^{-1}$, similar to the extremely low luminosity\nSNe 2010ae and 2008ha, and the light curve displays a similar fast decline\n(\\dmr $0.91 \\pm 0.10$ mag). SNe 2010ae and 2008ha have been classified as type\nIax supernovae, and together the three either make up a distinct physical class\nof their own or are at the extreme low luminosity end of this diverse supernova\npopulation. The bolometric light curve is consistent with a low kinetic energy\nof explosion ($E_{\\rm k} \\sim 10^{49}$ erg s$^{-1}$), a modest ejected mass\n($M_{\\rm ej} \\sim 0.2$ \\msol) and radioactive powering by $^{56}$Ni ($M_{\\rm\nNi} \\sim 2 \\times 10^{-3}$ \\msol).

In particular, a multi-center\nPower-Zienau-Woolley transformation yields a dipolar Hamiltonian which\nincorporates the light-matter coupling via both Peierls phases and a\npolarization density. We compare this dipolar gauge Hamiltonian and the\nstraightforward Coulomb gauge Hamiltonian for a one-dimensional solid, to\ndescribe sub-cycle light-driven electronic motion in the semiclassical limit,\nand a coupling of the solid to a quantized cavity mode which renormalizes the\nband-structure into electron-polariton bands.

However, even state-of-the-art denoisers cannot\nguarantee to remove noise entirely. Slight residual noise in the denoised\nimages could cause significant artifacts in the deblurring stage. To tackle\nthis problem, we propose a cascaded framework consisting of a denoiser\nsubnetwork and a deblurring subnetwork. In contrast to previous methods, we\ntrain the two subnetworks jointly. Joint learning reduces the effect of the\nresidual noise after denoising on deblurring, hence improves the robustness of\ndeblurring to heavy noise. Moreover, our method is also helpful for blur kernel\nestimation. Experiments on the CelebA dataset and the GOPRO dataset show that\nour method performs favorably against several state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jan 2020 12:59:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-28"}

Semimetallicity\nmanifests itself in a finite minimum conductance upon sweeping the gate over a\nlarge range in ionic liquid gated devices, which also offer spectroscopic\ncapabilities enabling the quantitative determination of the band overlap. The\nsemimetallic state is additionally revealed in Hall effect measurements by the\ncoexistence of electrons and holes, observed by either looking at the evolution\nof the Hall slope with sweeping the gate voltage or with lowering temperature.\nFinally, semimetallicity results in the low-temperature metallic conductivity\nof interfaces of two materials that are themselves insulating. These results\ndemonstrate the possibility to implement a state of matter that had not yet\nbeen realized in vdW interfaces, and represent a first step towards using these\ninterfaces to engineer topological or excitonic insulating states.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jan 2020 13:51:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-28"}

Many systems, modeled by multiplex networks\nwith various types of interactions, display an entirely different dynamical\nbehavior compared to the corresponding aggregated network. In many cases,\nunfortunately, only the aggregated topology and partial observations of the\nnetwork layers are available, raising an urgent demand for reconstructing\nmultiplex networks. We fill this gap by developing a mathematical and\ncomputational tool based on the Expectation-Maximization framework to\nreconstruct multiplex layer structures. The reconstruction accuracy depends on\nthe various factors, such as partial observation and network characteristics,\nlimiting our ability to predict and allocate observations. Surprisingly, by\nusing a mean-field approximation, we discovered that a discrimination indicator\nthat integrates all these factors universally determines the accuracy of\nreconstruction. This discovery enables us to design the optimal strategies to\nallocate the fixed budget for deriving the partial observations, promoting the\noptimal reconstruction of multiplex networks. To further evaluate the\nperformance of our method, we predict beside structure also dynamical behaviors\non the multiplex networks, including percolation, random walk, and spreading\nprocesses. Finally, applying our method on empirical multiplex networks drawn\nfrom biological, transportation, and social domains, corroborate the\ntheoretical analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jan 2020 14:19:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-28"}

The exact GF crucially depends on the value of the\none-electron GF at the origin, denoted as~$g_0$. The Born series is convergent\nonly if~$g_0$ is finite, which holds for electrons in parabolic energy bands\nin~$1D$, but not in~$2D$ and~$3D$. In the general case, the exact GF includes\nnonlinear combination of localized spins operators. A method of calculating\nmatrix elements of these operators is given.

We investigate the role of PAHs as a sink for deuterium in the\ninterstellar medium and study UV photolysis as a potential process in the\nvariations of the deuterium fractionation in the ISM. Methods. The UV\nphoto-induced fragmentation of various isotopologues of D-enriched, protonated\nanthracene and phenanthrene ions was recorded in a FTICR mass spectrometer.\nIRMPD spectroscopy using FELIX provided the IR spectra that were compared to\nDFT vibrational spectra; reaction barriers and rates were also calculated and\nrelated to the product abundances. Results. The mass spectra for both UV and\nIRMPD photolysis show the loss of H from [D-C$_{14}$H$_{10}$]$^+$, whereas\n[H-C$_{14}$D$_{10}$]$^+$ shows a strong preference for D loss. Calculations\nreveal facile 1,2-H and -D shift reactions, with barriers lower than the energy\nsupplied by the photo-excitation process. Together with confirmation of the\nground-state structures via the IR spectra, we determined that the photolytic\nprocesses in the 2 PAHs are largely governed by scrambling where the H and the\nD atoms relocate between different peripheral C atoms. The $\\sim$0.1 eV\ndifference in zero-point energy between C-H and C-D bonds ultimately leads to\nfaster H scrambling than D scrambling, and increased H atom loss compared to D.\nConclusion. Scrambling is common in PAH cations under UV radiation. Upon\nphotoexcitation of deuterium-enriched PAHs, the scrambling results in a higher\nprobability for the aliphatic D atom to migrate to an aromatic site, protecting\nit from elimination. This could lead to increased deuteration as a PAH moves\ntowards more exposed interstellar environments. Also, large, compact PAHs with\nan aliphatic C-HD group on solo sites might be responsible for the majority of\naliphatic C-D stretching bands seen in astronomical spectra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jan 2020 14:59:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-28"}

We determine no known\nnear-Earth asteroids have past (last 10^4 years) histories residing\nsignificantly inside the Granvik et al. (2016) limit, indirectly supporting the\ndisruption hypothesis. The exception is asteroid (467372) 2004 LG which spent\n2500 years within this limit, and thus presents a challenge to that theory.\nPhaethon has a perihelion distance hovering just above the limit and may be\nundergoing slow disruption, which may be the source of its dust complex.

In this paper, we propose general\nblack-box regularization algorithms for solving nonlinear inverse problems such\nas full-waveform inversion (FWI), which admit empirical priors that are\ndetermined adaptively by sophisticated denoising algorithms. The nonlinear\ninverse problem is solved by a proximal Newton method, which generalizes the\ntraditional Newton step in such a way to involve the gradients/subgradients of\na (possibly non-differentiable) regularization function through operator\nsplitting and proximal mappings. Furthermore, it requires to account for the\nHessian matrix in the regularized least-squares optimization problem. We\npropose two different splitting algorithms for this task. In the first, we\ncompute the Newton search direction with an iterative method based upon the\nfirst-order generalized iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm (ISTA), and\nhence Newton-ISTA (NISTA). The iterations require only Hessian-vector products\nto compute the gradient step of the quadratic approximation of the nonlinear\nobjective function. The second relies on the alternating direction method of\nmultipliers (ADMM), and hence Newton-ADMM (NADMM), where the least-square\noptimization subproblem and the regularization subproblem in the composite are\ndecoupled through auxiliary variable and solved in an alternating mode. We\ncompare NISTA and NADMM numerically by solving full-waveform inversion with\nBM3D regularizations. The tests show promising results obtained by both\nalgorithms.

The RCWA is\na semi-analytical numerical method that is widely used to solve the\nboundary-value problem of scattering by a grating. The approach requires the\nexpansion of all electromagnetic field phasors and the relative permittivity as\nFourier series in the spatial variable along the direction of the periodicity\nof the grating. In the direction perpendicular to the grating periodicity, the\ndomain is discretized into thin slices and the actual relative permittivity is\nreplaced by an approximation. The approximate relative permittivity is chosen\nso that the solution of the Maxwell equations in each slice can be computed\nwithout further approximation. Thus, there is error due to the approximate\nrelative permittivity as well as the trucation of the Fourier series.

This asymmetry is usually assured before the field is applied, as\nin the case of Janus spheres.

Above the threshold, the director forms\na polar self confined perturbation around the inclusion that oscillates with\nthe frequency of the applied field and propels the sphere.

Along this line, we systematically investigate the\nfinite-size scaling of structural and dynamical observables in geometric\nrenormalization flows of synthetic and real evolutionary networks. Our results\nshow that these observables can be well characterized by a certain scaling\nfunction. Specifically, we show that the critical exponent implied by the\nscaling function is independent of these observables but only depends on the\nsmall-world properties of the network, namely, all networks located in the\nsmall-world phase have a uniform scaling exponent, while those located in the\nnon-small-world phase and in their critical regions have another uniform\nscaling. More importantly, we perform extensive experiments on real\nevolutionary networks with small-world characteristics, and our results show\nthat these observables also have uniform scaling in their geometric\nrenormalization flows. Therefore, in a sense this exponent can be used as an\neffective measure for classifying universal small-world and non-small-world\nnetwork models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jan 2020 15:58:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Sep 2020 01:21:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-15"}

Relying on the Xen hypervisor,\nthis paper studies PML from three angles: power consumption, efficiency, and\nperformance impact on user applications. Our findings are as follows. First,\nPML does not incur any power consumption overhead. Second, PML reduces by up to\n10.18% both VM live migration and checkpointing time. Third, PML slightly\nreduces by up to 0.95% the performance degradation on applications incurred by\nlive migration and checkpointing. Fourth, PML however does not allow accurate\nWSS estimation because read accesses are not tracked and hot pages cannot be\nidentified. A naive extension of PML for addressing these limitations could\nlead to severe performance degradation (up to 34.8%) for the VM whose WSS is\ncomputed.\n  This paper presents Page Reference Logging (PRL), a smart extension of PML\nfor allowing both read and write accesses to be tracked. It does this without\nimpacting user VMs. The paper also presents a WSS estimation system which\nleverages PRL and shows how this algorithm can be integrated into a data center\nwhich implements memory overcommitment.

Learning to ask questions helps knowledge acquisition, improves\nquestion-answering and machine reading comprehension tasks, and helps a chatbot\nto keep the conversation flowing with a human. Existing question generation\nmodels are ineffective at generating a large amount of high-quality\nquestion-answer pairs from unstructured text, since given an answer and an\ninput passage, question generation is inherently a one-to-many mapping. In this\npaper, we propose Answer-Clue-Style-aware Question Generation (ACS-QG), which\naims at automatically generating high-quality and diverse question-answer pairs\nfrom unlabeled text corpus at scale by imitating the way a human asks\nquestions. Our system consists of: i) an information extractor, which samples\nfrom the text multiple types of assistive information to guide question\ngeneration; ii) neural question generators, which generate diverse and\ncontrollable questions, leveraging the extracted assistive information; and\niii) a neural quality controller, which removes low-quality generated data\nbased on text entailment. We compare our question generation models with\nexisting approaches and resort to voluntary human evaluation to assess the\nquality of the generated question-answer pairs. The evaluation results suggest\nthat our system dramatically outperforms state-of-the-art neural question\ngeneration models in terms of the generation quality, while being scalable in\nthe meantime. With models trained on a relatively smaller amount of data, we\ncan generate 2.8 million quality-assured question-answer pairs from a million\nsentences found in Wikipedia.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 27 Jan 2020 05:27:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Mar 2020 01:06:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-06"}

Relying on the weak, volatile thermo-optic or electro-optic\neffects, such systems usually exhibit limited reconfigurability along with high\nenergy consumption and large footprints. These challenges can be addressed by\nresorting to chalcogenide phase-change materials (PCMs) such as Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST)\nthat provide substantial optical contrast in a self-holding fashion upon phase\ntransitions. However, current PCM-based integrated photonic applications are\nlimited to single devices or simple PICs due to the poor scalability of the\noptical or electrical self-heating actuation approaches. Thermal-conduction\nheating via external electrical heaters, instead, allows large-scale\nintegration and large-area switching, but fast and energy-efficient electrical\ncontrol is yet to show. Here, we model electrical switching of GST-clad\nintegrated nanophotonic structures with graphene heaters based on the\nprogrammable GST-on-silicon platform. Thanks to the ultra-low heat capacity and\nhigh in-plane thermal conductivity of graphene, the proposed structures exhibit\na high switching speed of ~80 MHz and high energy efficiency of 19.2 aJ/nm^3\n(6.6 aJ/nm^3) for crystallization (amorphization) while achieving complete\nphase transitions to ensure strong attenuation (~6.46 dB/micron) and optical\nphase (~0.28 dB/micron at 1550 nm) modulation. Compared with indium tin oxide\nand silicon p-i-n heaters, the structures with graphene heaters display two\norders of magnitude higher figure of merits for heating and overall\nperformance. Our work facilitates the analysis and understanding of the\nthermal-conduction heating-enabled phase transitions on PICs and supports the\ndevelopment of the future large-scale PCM-based electronic-photonic systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Jan 2020 18:41:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-24"}

While using the black box to label images, our explanation\nmethod exploits the latent feature space learned through an adversarial\nautoencoder. The proposed method first generates exemplar images in the latent\nfeature space and learns a decision tree classifier. Then, it selects and\ndecodes exemplars respecting local decision rules. Finally, it visualizes them\nin a manner that shows to the user how the exemplars can be modified to either\nstay within their class, or to become counter-factuals by \"morphing\" into\nanother class. Since we focus on black box decision systems for image\nclassification, the explanation obtained from the exemplars also provides a\nsaliency map highlighting the areas of the image that contribute to its\nclassification, and areas of the image that push it into another class.
