Here, we\ninvestigate the connection between the alula and LEV attachment via flow\nmeasurements in a wind tunnel. We show that a model alula, whose wetted area is\n1% that of the wing, stabilizes a recirculatory aft-tilted LEV on a\nsteadily-translating unswept wing inclined at post-stall incidences. The\nattached vortex is the result of the alula's ability to smoothly merge\notherwise separate leading- and side-edge vortical flows. We identify two key\nprocesses that facilitate this merging: i) the steering of spanwise vorticity\ngenerated at the wing's leading edge back to the wing plane and ii) an\naft-located wall-jet of high-magnitude root-to-tip spanwise flow (>80% that of\nthe freestream velocity). The latter feature induces LEV roll-up while the\nformer feature tilts LEV vorticity aft and evacuates this flow toward the wing\ntip via an outboard vorticity flux. We identify the alula's streamwise position\n(relative to the leading-edge of the thin wing) as important for vortex\nsteering and the alula's cant angle as important for high-magnitude spanwise\nflow generation.

For small and\nlarge fields, the time asymmetrical swimmer is more efficient, as suggested by\nPurcell.

The first of these schemes, the\nadaptive spiral search, provides a better acquisition time performance by\ndividing the search region into a number of smaller subregions, and\nprioritizing search in regions of higher probability mass. The second\ntechnique---the shotgun approach---searches the region in a random manner by\nsampling the search region according to a Gaussian distribution. The adaptive\nspiral scheme outperforms the shotgun approach in terms of acquisition time,\nespecially if the number of search subregions is large enough.

On the other hand, the shotgun scanning approach\ndoes not require such stringent pointing accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Jan 2020 23:10:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-14"}

Using\nsurfaces that represent geological boundaries, the objectives are to identify\nareas where refinement is needed, increase spatial resolution to minimize\nsurface approximation error, reduce redundancy to increase the compactness of\nthe model and identify the geological domain on a block-by-block basis. These\nobjectives are fulfilled by four system components which perform block-surface\noverlap detection, spatial structure decomposition, sub-blocks consolidation\nand block tagging, respectively. The main contributions are a coordinate-ascent\nmerging algorithm and a flexible architecture for updating the spatial\nstructure of a block model when given multiple surfaces, which emphasizes the\nability to selectively retain or modify previously assigned block labels. The\ntechniques employed include block-surface intersection analysis based on the\nseparable axis theorem and ray-tracing for establishing the location of blocks\nrelative to surfaces. To demonstrate the robustness and applicability of the\nproposed block merging strategy in a more narrow setting, it is used to reduce\nblock fragmentation in an existing model where surfaces are not given and the\nminimum block size is fixed. To obtain further insight, a systematic comparison\nwith octree subblocking subsequently illustrates the inherent constraints of\ndyadic hierarchical decomposition and the importance of inter-scale merging.\nThe results show the proposed method produces merged blocks with less extreme\naspect ratios and is highly amenable to parallel processing.

Building systems that are Radiation Hardened by Design (RHBD) is\nthe preferred approach, but existing techniques are expensive in terms of\nperformance, power, and/or area. This paper introduces a novel soft-error\nresilient asynchronous bundled-data design template, SERAD, which uses a\ncombination of temporal and spatial redundancy to mitigate Single Event\nTransients (SETs) and upsets (SEUs). SERAD uses Error Detecting Logic (EDL) to\ndetect SETs at the inputs of sequential elements and correct them via\nre-sampling. Because SERAD only pays the delay penalty in the presence of an\nSET, which rarely occurs, its average performance is comparable to the baseline\nsynchronous design. We tested the SERAD design using a combination of Spice and\nVerilog simulations and evaluated its impact on area, frequency, and power on\nan open-core MIPS-like processor using a NCSU 45nm cell library.

In order for these models to be\nsafely deployed, we would like to ensure that they do not use confounding\nvariables to make their classification, and that they will work well even when\ntested on images from hospitals that were not included in the training data. We\nattempt to address this problem in the context of pneumonia classification from\nchest radiographs. We propose an approach based on adversarial optimization,\nwhich allows us to learn more robust models that do not depend on confounders.\nSpecifically, we demonstrate improved out-of-hospital generalization\nperformance of a pneumonia classifier by training a model that is invariant to\nthe view position of chest radiographs (anterior-posterior vs.\nposterior-anterior). Our approach leads to better predictive performance on\nexternal hospital data than both a standard baseline and previously proposed\nmethods to handle confounding, and also suggests a method for identifying\nmodels that may rely on confounders.

To achieve\na robust image classification for occluded images, this paper proposes a novel\nscheme using subspace decomposition based estimation (SDBE). The proposed\nSDBE-based classification scheme first employs a base convolutional neural\nnetwork to extract the deep feature vector (DFV) and then utilizes the SDBE to\ncompute the DFV of the original occlusion-free image for classification. The\nSDBE is performed by projecting the DFV of the occluded image onto the linear\nspan of a class dictionary (CD) along the linear span of an occlusion error\ndictionary (OED). The CD and OED are constructed respectively by concatenating\nthe DFVs of a training set and the occlusion error vectors of an extra set of\nimage pairs. Two implementations of the SDBE are studied in this paper: the\n$l_1$-norm and the squared $l_2$-norm regularized least-squares estimates. By\nemploying the ResNet-152, pre-trained on the ILSVRC2012 training set, as the\nbase network, the proposed SBDE-based classification scheme is extensively\nevaluated on the Caltech-101 and ILSVRC2012 datasets.

Many of these methods can\ngenerate visually plausible alpha estimations, but typically yield blurry\nstructures or textures in the semitransparent area. This is due to the local\nambiguity of transparent objects. One possible solution is to leverage the\nfar-surrounding information to estimate the local opacity. Traditional\naffinity-based methods often suffer from the high computational complexity,\nwhich are not suitable for high resolution alpha estimation. Inspired by\naffinity-based method and the successes of contextual attention in inpainting,\nwe develop a novel end-to-end approach for natural image matting with a guided\ncontextual attention module, which is specifically designed for image matting.\nGuided contextual attention module directly propagates high-level opacity\ninformation globally based on the learned low-level affinity. The proposed\nmethod can mimic information flow of affinity-based methods and utilize rich\nfeatures learned by deep neural networks simultaneously.

In\nBi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\\delta}$ superconductor with two CuO$_2$ planes in\none structural unit, the interaction between the two CuO$_2$ planes gives rise\nto band splitting into two Fermi surface sheets (bilayer splitting) that have\ndistinct superconducting gap. The iron based superconductors are composed of\nstacking of the FeAs/FeSe layers; whether the interlayer coupling can cause\nsimilar band splitting and its effect on superconductivity remain unclear. Here\nwe report high resolution laser-based angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy\n(ARPES) measurements on a newly discovered iron based superconductor,\nKCa$_2$Fe$_4$As$_4$F$_2$ (T$_C$=33.5\\,K) which consists of stacking FeAs blocks\nwith two FeAs layers separated by insulating Ca$_2$F$_2$ blocks. Bilayer\nsplitting effect is observed for the first time that gives rise to totally five\nhole-like Fermi surface sheets around the Brilliouin zone center. Band\nstructure calculations reproduce the observed bilayer splitting by identifying\ninterlayer interorbital interaction between the two FeAs layers within one FeAs\nblock. All the hole-like pockets around the zone center exhibit Fermi\nsurface-dependent and nodeless superconducting gap. The gap functions with\nshort-range antiferromagetic fluctuations are proposed and the gap symmetry can\nbe well understood when the interlayer pairing is considered. The particularly\nstrong interlayer pairing is observed for one of the bands.

These maps essentially satisfy the\nincompressibility condition as well as the local and global energy inequalities\nand the pressure equation which may be derived formally from the Navier-Stokes\nsystem of equations, but they are not required to satisfy the Navier-Stokes\nsystem itself.\n  We extend this notion to a system considered by Fang-Hua Lin and Chun Liu in\nthe mid 1990s related to models of the flow of nematic liquid crystals, which\ninclude the Navier-Stokes system when the \"director field\" $d$ is taken to be\nzero. In addition to an extended Navier-Stokes system, the Lin-Liu model\nincludes a further parabolic system which implies an a priori maximum principle\nfor $d$ which they use to establish partial regularity (specifically,\n$\\mathcal{P}^{1}(\\mathcal{S})=0$) of solutions.\n  For the analogous \"inequality\" one loses this maximum principle, but here we\nnonetheless establish certain partial regularity results (namely\n$\\mathcal{P}^{\\frac 92 + \\delta}(\\mathcal{S})=0$, so that in particular the\nputative singular set $\\mathcal{S}$ has space-time Lebesgue measure zero).\nUnder an additional assumption on $d$ for any fixed value of a certain\nparameter $\\sigma \\in (5,6)$ (which for $\\sigma =6$ reduces precisely to the\nboundedness of $d$ used by Lin and Liu), we obtain the same partial regularity\n($\\mathcal{P}^{1}(\\mathcal{S})=0$) as do Lin and Liu. In particular, we recover\nthe partial regularity result ($\\mathcal{P}^{1}(\\mathcal{S})=0$) of\nCaffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg (1982) for \"suitable weak solutions\" of the\nNavier-Stokes system, and we verify Scheffer's assertion that the same hold for\nsolutions of the weaker \"inequality\" as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jan 2020 08:17:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 11:11:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 26 Oct 2021 15:46:31 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 9 Sep 2022 11:15:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-12"}

Though the\nspatial distribution of backhaul-connected APs can be captured by the Poison\npoint process (PPP), the desired locations of relay APs depend on the\ntransmission protocol operated in the mmWave network. In this paper, we\nconsider modeling the topology of mmWave AP network by incorporating the\nmultihop protocol. We first derive the topology of AP network with the spatial\nmultiplexing disabled for each transmission hop. Then we analyze the topology\nwhen the spatial multiplexing is enabled at the mmWave APs. To derive the\nnetwork throughput, we first quantify the improvement in latency and the\ndegradation of coverage probability with the increase of spatial multiplexing\ngain at mmWave APs. Then we show the impact of spatial multiplexing on the\nthroughput for the ultra-dense mmWave AP network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jan 2020 09:32:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Feb 2020 00:53:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-18"}

Despite considerable effort, particularly in the\nintersecting case, this conjecture remains wide open, motivating the pursuit of\nvariants of the original conjecture. Recently, Bustamante and Stein and,\nindependently, Kir\\'{a}ly and T\\'{o}thm\\'{e}r\\'{e}sz considered the problem\nunder the assumption that the hypergraph is $t$-intersecting, conjecturing that\nthe cover number $\\tau(\\mathcal{H})$ of such a hypergraph $\\mathcal{H}$ is at\nmost $r - t$. In these papers, it was proven that the conjecture is true for $r\n\\leq 4t-1$, but also that it need not be sharp; when $r = 5$ and $t = 2$, one\nhas $\\tau(\\mathcal{H}) \\leq 2$.\n  We extend these results in two directions. First, for all $t \\geq 2$ and $r\n\\leq 3t-1$, we prove a tight upper bound on the cover number of these\nhypergraphs, showing that they in fact satisfy $\\tau(\\mathcal{H}) \\leq\n\\lfloor(r - t)/2 \\rfloor + 1$. Second, we extend the range of $t$ for which the\nconjecture is known to be true, showing that it holds for all $r \\leq\n\\frac{36}{7}t-5$. We also introduce several related variations on this theme.\nAs a consequence of our tight bounds, we resolve the problem for $k$-wise\n$t$-intersecting hypergraphs, for all $k \\geq 3$ and $t \\geq 1$. We further\ngive bounds on the cover numbers of strictly $t$-intersecting hypergraphs and\nthe $s$-cover numbers of $t$-intersecting hypergraphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jan 2020 10:12:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 27 Nov 2020 10:33:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-30"}

Photometry of red giant branch\n(RGB) stars has been and still is instrumental in enabling the detection and\ncharacterization of cluster MPs, through the appropriate choices of filters,\ncolours and colour combinations, that are mainly sensitive to N and --to a\nlesser degree-- C stellar surface abundances. An important issue not yet\nproperly addressed is that the translation of the observed widths of the\ncluster RGBs to abundance spreads must account for the effect of the first\ndredge-up on the surface chemical patterns, hence on the spectral energy\ndistributions of stars belonging to the various MPs. We have filled this gap by\nstudying theoretically the impact of the dredge-up on the predicted widths of\nRGBs in clusters hosting MPs. We find that for a given initial range of N\nabundances, the first dredge up reduces the predicted RGB widths in N-sensitive\nfilters compared to the case when its effect on the stellar spectral energy\ndistributions is not accounted for. This reduction is a strong function of age\nand has also a dependence on metallicity. The net effect is an underestimate of\nthe initial N-abundance ranges from RGB photometry if the first dredge-up is\nnot accounted for in the modelling, and also the potential determination of\nspurious trends of N-abundance spreads with age.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jan 2020 10:34:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-22"}

Prior works on acquiring CSK, such as\nConceptNet, have compiled statements that associate concepts, like everyday\nobjects or activities, with properties that hold for most or some instances of\nthe concept. Each concept is treated in isolation from other concepts, and the\nonly quantitative measure (or ranking) of properties is a confidence score that\nthe statement is valid. This paper aims to overcome these limitations by\nintroducing a multi-faceted model of CSK statements and methods for joint\nreasoning over sets of inter-related statements. Our model captures four\ndifferent dimensions of CSK statements: plausibility, typicality, remarkability\nand salience, with scoring and ranking along each dimension. For example,\nhyenas drinking water is typical but not salient, whereas hyenas eating\ncarcasses is salient. For reasoning and ranking, we develop a method with soft\nconstraints, to couple the inference over concepts that are related in in a\ntaxonomic hierarchy. The reasoning is cast into an integer linear programming\n(ILP), and we leverage the theory of reduction costs of a relaxed LP to compute\ninformative rankings. This methodology is applied to several large CSK\ncollections. Our evaluation shows that we can consolidate these inputs into\nmuch cleaner and more expressive knowledge.

However, approaches to finding logic bugs,\nsuch as when a DBMS computes an incorrect result set, have remained mostly\nuntackled. Differential testing is an effective technique to test systems that\nsupport a common language by comparing the outputs of these systems. However,\nthis technique is ineffective for DBMS, because each DBMS typically supports\nits own SQL dialect.

As vanilla GANs are not sufficiently\nrobust to generate sequence-like characters in natural images, we propose an\nadversarial learning framework for the generation and recognition of multiple\ncharacters in an image. The proposed framework consists of an attention-based\nrecognizer and a generative adversarial architecture. Furthermore, to tackle\nthe issue of lacking paired training samples, we design an interactive joint\ntraining scheme, which shares attention masks from the recognizer to the\ndiscriminator, and enables the discriminator to extract the features of each\ncharacter for further adversarial training. Benefiting from the character-level\nadversarial training, our framework requires only unpaired simple data for\nstyle supervision. Each target style sample containing only one randomly chosen\ncharacter can be simply synthesized online during the training. This is\nsignificant as the training does not require costly paired samples or\ncharacter-level annotations. Thus, only the input images and corresponding text\nlabels are needed. In addition to the style normalization of the backgrounds,\nwe refine character patterns to ease the recognition task. A feedback mechanism\nis proposed to bridge the gap between the discriminator and the recognizer.\nTherefore, the discriminator can guide the generator according to the confusion\nof the recognizer, so that the generated patterns are clearer for recognition.\nExperiments on various benchmarks, including both regular and irregular text,\ndemonstrate that our method significantly reduces the difficulty of\nrecognition.

This paper studies the game Patchwork, a\ntwo player strategy game using polyomino tile drafting and placement. The core\npolyomino placement mechanic is implemented in a constraint model using regular\nconstraints, extending and improving the model in (Lagerkvist, Pesant, 2008)\nwith: explicit rotation handling; optional placements; and new constraints for\nresource usage. Crucial for implementing good game playing agents is to have\ngreat heuristics for guiding the search when faced with large branching\nfactors. This paper divides placing tiles into two parts: a policy used for\nplacing parts and an evaluation used to select among different placements.\nPolicies are designed based on classical packing literature as well as common\nstandard constraint programming heuristics. For evaluation, global propagation\nguided regret is introduced, choosing placements based on not ruling out later\nplacements. Extensive evaluations are performed, showing the importance of\nusing a good evaluation and that the proposed global propagation guided regret\nis a very effective guide.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jan 2020 13:29:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-14"}

A wide gamut of dynamics was observed by varying the impact\nWeber number We, the Hartmann number Ha and the magnetic field strength\nmanifested through the magnetic Bond number Bom. For a fixed We 60, we observed\nthat at moderately low Bom 300, droplet rebound off the SH surface is\nsuppressed. The noted We is chosen to observe various impact outcomes and to\nreveal the consequent ferrohydrodynamic mechanisms. We also show that\nferrohydrodynamic interactions leads to asymmetric spreading, and the droplet\nspreads preferentially in a direction orthogonal to the magnetic field lines.\nWe show analytically that during the retraction regime, the kinetic energy of\nthe droplet is distributed unequally in the transverse and longitudinal\ndirections due to the Lorentz force.

Efficient resource provisioning and\ntask scheduling in such systems are non-trivial and require close monitoring\nand accurate forecasting of the state of the system, specifically resource\nutilisation at its constituent machines. Two challenges present themselves\ntowards these objectives. First, collecting monitoring data entails substantial\ncommunication overhead. This overhead can be prohibitively high, especially in\nnetworks where bandwidth is limited. Second, forecasting models to predict\nresource utilisation should be accurate and need to exhibit high inference\nspeed. Mission critical scheduling and resource allocation algorithms use these\npredictions and rely on their immediate availability. To address the first\nchallenge, we present a communication-efficient data collection mechanism.\nResource utilisation data is collected at the individual machines in the system\nand transmitted to a central controller in batches. Each batch is processed by\nan adaptive data-reduction algorithm based on Fourier transforms and truncation\nin the frequency domain. We show that the proposed mechanism leads to a\nsignificant reduction in communication overhead while incurring only minimal\nerror and adhering to accuracy guarantees. To address the second challenge, we\npropose a deep learning architecture using complex Gated Recurrent Units to\nforecast resource utilisation.

Unfortunately, random forests are not intrinsically\ninterpretable since their prediction results from averaging several hundreds of\ndecision trees. A classic approach to gain knowledge on this so-called\nblack-box algorithm is to compute variable importances, that are employed to\nassess the predictive impact of each input variable. Variable importances are\nthen used to rank or select variables and thus play a great role in data\nanalysis.

Recently, excitation of the\nhigh-quality supercavity modes (quasi-BIC states) in individual subwavelength\ndielectric particles has been predicted to boost the nonlinear frequency\nconversion at the nanoscale. Here, we put forward the multipolar model which\ncaptures the physics behind linear and nonlinear response driven by such\nhigh-$Q$ modes in nanoresonators. We show that formation of the quasi-BIC state\nin the AlGaAs nanodisk can be understood through multipolar transformations of\ncoupled leaky modes. In particular, the hybridized axially symmetric\nTE-polarized modes can be viewed as superpositions of multipoles, with a basis\nof parent multipoles constituted mainly by magnetic dipoles and octupole. The\nquasi-BIC point in the parameter space appears where dipolar losses are totally\nsuppressed. The efficient optical coupling to this state is implemented via\nazimuthally polarized beam illumination matching its multipolar origin. We\nestablish a one-to-one correspondence between the standard non Hermitian\ncoupled-mode theory and multipolar models that enables transparent\ninterpretation of scattering characteristics. Using our approach, we derive the\nmultipolar composition of the generated second-harmonic radiation from the\nAlGaAs nanodisk and validate it with full-wave numerical simulations.\nBack-action of the second-harmonic radiation onto the fundamental frequency is\ntaken into account in the coupled nonlinear model with pump depletion. A hybrid\nmetal-dielectric nanoantenna is proposed to augment the conversion efficiency\nup to tens of per cent and actualize the nonlinear parametric downconversion.\nOur findings delineate the in-depth conceptual framework and novel promising\nstrategies in the design of functional elements for nonlinear nanophotonics\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jan 2020 14:54:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-31"}

The principle\nis to decompose the evolution of a quantum system into two wave functions: an\nexternal wave function corresponding to the evolution of its center of mass and\nan internal wave function corresponding to the evolution of its internal\nvariables in the center-of-mass system. Mathematical decomposition is only\npossible in certain cases because there are many interactions linking these two\nparts. In addition, these two wave functions will have different meanings and\ninterpretations. The external wave function \"pilots\" the center of mass of the\nquantum system: it corresponds to the Broglie pilot wave. When the Planck\nconstant tends to zero, it results mathematically from the convergence of the\nsquare of the module and the phase of the external wave function to a density\nand a classical action verifying the Hamilton-Jacobi statistical equations.\nThis interpretation explains all the measurement results, namely those yielded\nby interference, spin measurement (Stern and Gerlach) and non-locality (EPR-B)\nexperiments. For the internal wave function, several interpretations are\npossible : the one of the pilot wave can be applied in cascade to the internal\nwave function. However, the interpretation proposed by Erwin Schr{\\\"o}dinger at\nthe Solvay Congress in 1927 and restricted to the internal wave function is\nalso possible. For Schr{\\\"o}dinger, the particles are extended and the square\nof the module of the (internal) wave function of an electron corresponds to the\ndensity of its charge in space. We present many arguments in favour of this\ninterpretation, which like the pilot wave interpretation is realistic and\ndeterministic. Finally, we will see that this double interpretation serves as a\nframe of reference by which to better understand the debates on the\ninterpretation of quantum mechanics and to review the relationships between\ngravity and quantum mechanics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jan 2020 13:41:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-15"}

One of the prime aspects influencing the service\nrecommendation is the Quality-of-Service (QoS) parameter, which depicts the\nperformance of a web service. In general, the service provider furnishes the\nvalue of the QoS parameters during service deployment. However, in reality, the\nQoS values of service vary across different users, time, locations, etc.\nTherefore, estimating the QoS value of service before its execution is an\nimportant task, and thus the QoS prediction has gained significant research\nattention. Multiple approaches are available in the literature for predicting\nservice QoS. However, these approaches are yet to reach the desired accuracy\nlevel. In this paper, we study the QoS prediction problem across different\nusers, and propose a novel solution by taking into account the contextual\ninformation of both services and users. Our proposal includes two key steps:\n(a) hybrid filtering and (b) hierarchical prediction mechanism. On the one\nhand, the hybrid filtering method aims to obtain a set of similar users and\nservices, given a target user and a service. On the other hand, the goal of the\nhierarchical prediction mechanism is to estimate the QoS value accurately by\nleveraging hierarchical neural-regression.

In overfilled sessions at the\nColl\\'{e}ge de France and the Sorbonne, Einstein explained his theories of\nrelativity, and prominent physicists, mathematicians and philosophers listened,\ndebated, questioned and explored facets of relativity. The 1922 visit had its\nechoes in the life and works of many who participated, particularly decisive\nfor Einstein and the philosopher Henri Bergson. This essay examines that\neventful visit, focusing on the physical and logical aspects of Bergson's\ncritique, with physics commentaries, linking prominent French physicists and\nmathematicians Langevin, Painlev\\'{e}, Hadamard, Becquerel, Sagnac, and\nKastler. I give particular attention to the logical and empirical accuracy of\nthe physics issues involved, delineating Bergson's exact reasoning for his\nphilosophical enthusiasm in Einstein's theory and for the ensuing critique.\nBergson's philosophical stand on duration and simultaneity is reassessed in the\ncontext of later developments in cosmological physics as well as the wealth of\nempirical data involving comparison of atomic clocks. Finally we are led\nnaturally to a surprising completion of the philosopher's program on universal\ntime, duration and simultaneity, in harmony with the time of the physicist. In\nthe appendices after the main text I also give the physics background and\neasily verifiable proofs for the assertions made in the text, pertaining to\nrelativity, simultaneity and time dilation, clearly distinguishing beliefs and\nfacts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jan 2020 11:52:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-29"}

Based on the average\ncontent popularity, optimal content caching probabilities can be found, e.g.,\nfrom solving optimization problems, and existing results in the literature can\nimplement the optimal caching probabilities via static content placement. The\nobjective of this work is to design dynamic probabilistic caching that: i)\nconverge (in distribution) to the optimal content caching probabilities under\ntime-invariant content popularity, and ii) adapt to the time-varying\ninstantaneous content popularity under time-varying content popularity.\nAchieving the above objective requires a novel design of dynamic content\nreplacement because static caching cannot adapt to varying content popularity\nwhile classic dynamic replacement policies, such as LRU, cannot converge to\ntarget caching probabilities (as they do not exploit any content popularity\ninformation). We model the design of dynamic probabilistic replacement policy\nas the problem of finding the state transition probability matrix of a Markov\nchain and propose a method to generate and refine the transition probability\nmatrix.

So in order to discuss\n3-space and dynamics, we recall briefly Minkowski's approach in 1910\nimplementing the nowadays commonly used 4-vector calculus and related tensorial\nrepresentations as well as Klein's 1910 paper on the geometry of the Lorentz\ngroup. To include microscopic representations, we discuss few aspects of\nWigner's and Weinberg's 'boost' approach to describe 'any spin' with respect to\nits reductive Lie algebra and coset theory, and we relate the physical\nidentification to objects in $P^{5}$ based on the case $(1,0)\\oplus(0,1)$ of\nthe electromagnetic field. So instead of following this -- in some aspects --\nspecial and misleading 'old' representation theory, based on 4-vector calculus\nand tensors, we provide and use an alternative representation based on line\ngeometry which -- besides comprising known representation theory -- is capable\nof both describing (classical) projective geometry of 3-space as well as it\nyields spin matrices and the classical Lie transfer. In addition, this geometry\nis capable of providing a more general route to known Lie symmetries,\nespecially of the su(2)$\\oplus$i~su(2) Lie algebra of special relativity, as\nwell as it comprises gauge theories and affine geometry. Thus it serves as\nfoundation for a future understanding of more general representation theory of\nrelativity based, however, on roots known from classical projective geometry\nand $P^{5}$. As an application, we discuss Lorentz transformations in point\nspace in terms of line and Complex geometry, where we can identify them as...\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 12 Jan 2020 18:44:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-21"}
