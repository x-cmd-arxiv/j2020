Mn dopants in Bi$_2$Se$_3$ represent one of the most\nstudied examples here. However, there is a lot of open questions regarding\ntheir magnetic ordering. In the experimental literature different Curie\ntemperatures or no ferromagnetic order at all are reported for comparable Mn\nconcentrations. This suggests that magnetic ordering phenomena are complex and\nhighly susceptible to different growth parameters, which are known to affect\nmaterial defect concentrations. So far theory focused on Mn dopants in one\npossible position, and neglected relaxation effects as well as native defects.\nWe have used ab initio methods to calculate the Bi$_2$Se$_3$ electronic\nstructure influenced by magnetic Mn dopants, and exchange interactions between\nthem. We have considered two possible Mn positions, the substitutional and\ninterstitial one, and also native defects. We have found a sizable relaxation\nof atoms around Mn, which affects significantly magnetic interactions.\nSurprisingly, very strong interactions correspond to a specific position of Mn\natoms separated by van der Waals gap. Based on the calculated data we performed\nspin dynamics simulations to examine systematically the resulting magnetic\norder for various defect contents. We have found under which conditions the\nexperimentally measured Curie temperatures ${T_{\\rm{C}}}$ can be reproduced,\nnoticing that interstitial Mn atoms appear to be important here.

Both of these models make sense when the human receives\ndeterministic rewards: i.e., gaining either $100 or $130 with certainty. But in\nreal world scenarios, rewards are rarely deterministic.

Following work\nof (Fritz, Rev. Math. Phys. 2012) and (Junge et al., J. Math. Phys. 2011) our\nresults provide a refutation of Connes' embedding conjecture from the theory of\nvon Neumann algebras.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jan 2020 16:32:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Sep 2020 14:10:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 4 Nov 2022 07:15:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-11-07"}

We assess the impact of energy\ninjection, wind opacity, magnetic field strength and the mass of the host\ngalaxy on flow velocity, temperature, density and pressure profiles. For an\nM82-like wind, a thermally-dominated driving mechanism is found to deliver the\nfastest and hottest wind. Radiation-driven winds in typical starburst-galaxy\nconfigurations are unable to attain the higher flow velocities and temperatures\nassociated with thermal and cosmic ray-driven systems, leading to higher wind\ndensities which would be more susceptible to cooling and fragmentation at lower\naltitudes. High opacity winds are more sensitive to radiative driving, but\nterminal flow velocities are still lower than those achieved by other driving\nmechanisms at realistic opacities. We demonstrate that variations in the\noutflow magnetic field can influence its coupling with cosmic rays, where\nstronger fields enable greater streaming but less driving near the base of the\nflow, instead with cosmic rays redirecting their driving impact to higher\naltitudes. The gravitational potential is less important in M82-like wind\nconfigurations, and substantial variations in the flow profiles only emerge at\nhigh altitude in massive haloes.

The work is a model-independent analysis of the\ncosmological supernova (Type Ia) data, where function families are fit to the\ndata in form of luminosity distance as function of redshift, that is,\n$d_{L}(z)$; and subsequently time-derivatives of the scale function $a(t)$ are\n$analytically$ derived, but as functions of $z$, without making assumptions\nabout of gravity or the contents of the universe. This gives, e.g. the redshift\nvalue at which the universe goes over from deceleration to acceleration, as\n$z_{t}=0.54 \\pm 0.04$ for a flat universe. In the update, we switch to a more\nmodern fit criterion and also take into account the uncertainty in the\ncalibration of the SNIa luminosities.\n  If a theory of gravity $is$ assumed, our results allow determination of the\ndensity of the universe as function of $z$, from which conclusions about the\ncontents of the universe can be drawn. We update the previous work's result\nwhere this was done for Einstein gravity, finding a lower-limit on the dark\nenergy fraction, $\\Omega_{DE}>0.46$; and here we do this also for Starobinsky\ngravity, where we can find a Starobinsky parameter that can eliminate the need\nfor dark energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jan 2020 17:18:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-08"}

We analyze two variants of the Three-Pass algorithm and demonstrate\nthat in a well-optimized implementation on HPC-class processors performance of\nall three passes is limited by memory bandwidth. We then present a novel\nalgorithm for softmax computation in just two passes. The proposed Two-Pass\nalgorithm avoids both numerical overflow and the extra normalization pass by\nemploying an exotic representation for intermediate values, where each value is\nrepresented as a pair of floating-point numbers: one representing the\n\"mantissa\" and another representing the \"exponent\".

The\nproposed Two-Pass algorithm also outperforms the traditional Three-Pass\nalgorithm on Intel Broadwell and AMD Zen 2 processors.

The evaporation efficiency is determined by the temperature\n$T_{\\rm ch}\\propto F^{2/3}$ to which the outflow is heated by the flux $F$ on a\ndynamical time-scale. Evaporation is most efficient for companions that fill\ntheir Roche lobes. In this case, the outflow is dominated by a cap around the\nL1 point with an angle $\\theta_g\\sim (T_{\\rm ch}/T_g)^{1/2}$, and the\nevaporation time is $t_{\\rm evap}=0.46(T_{\\rm ch}/T_g)^{-2}\\textrm{ Gyr}$,\nwhere $T_g>T_{\\rm ch}$ is the companion's virial temperature.

While the original (Fruchter et al. 1988) black\nwidow evaporates its companion on a few Gyr time-scale, direct evaporation on\nits own is too weak to explain the overall population. We propose instead that\nthe evaporative wind couples to the companion's magnetic field, removes angular\nmomentum from the binary, and maintains stable Roche-lobe overflow. While a\nstronger wind carries more mass, it also reduces the Alfv\\'en radius, making\nthis indirect magnetic braking mechanism less dependent on the flux $t_{\\rm\nmag}\\propto t_{\\rm evap}^{1/3}$.

For a given\nmetallicity Z, stars exceeding a certain initial mass M_single(Z) can reach the\nWR phase through intrinsic mass-loss (single-star channel). Stars of lower\nmasses can reach the WR phase via binary mass transfer (binary channel). It is\ncommonly assumed that the binary channel dominates the formation of WR stars in\nenvironments with low Z such as the SMC and LMC. However, their reported WR\nbinary fractions of 30-40% are comparable to that of the Galaxy. Here, we\nexplain this apparent contradiction by considering the minimum initial mass\nM_spec(Z) needed for the stripped product to appear as a WR star. We calibrate\nM_spec(Z) using the lowest-luminosity WR stars in the Clouds and the Galaxy. A\nrange of M_single(Z) values are explored using various evolution codes. We\nestimate the additional contribution of the binary channel by considering the\ninterval [M_spec(Z), M_single(Z)], which characterises the initial-mass range\nin which binaries can form additional WR stars.\n  Results: The WR-phenomenon ceases below luminosities of logL = 4.9, 5.25, and\n5.6 [Lsun] in the Galaxy, LMC, and SMC, which translates to He-star masses of\n7.5, 11, 17 Msun and initial masses of M_spec = 18, 23, 37 Msun.

We find that that the additional contribution of the\nbinary channel is a non-trivial function of Z that cannot be conclusively\nclaimed to be monotonically increasing with decreasing Z. Hence, one should not\na-priori expect that binary interactions become increasingly important in\nforming WR stars at low Z, or that the WR binary fraction grows with decreasing\nZ.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jan 2020 19:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-12"}

Accelerated MRI scan may be achieved by acquiring less amount\nof k-space data (down-sampling in the k-space). However, this leads to lower\nresolution and aliasing artifacts for the reconstructed images. There are many\nexisting approaches for attempting to reconstruct high-quality images from\ndown-sampled k-space data, with varying complexity and performance. In recent\nyears, deep-learning approaches have been proposed for this task, and promising\nresults have been reported. Still, the problem remains challenging especially\nbecause of the high fidelity requirement in most medical applications employing\nreconstructed MRI images.

As\nauspicious as this approach is, it brings forth many challenges: from data\nsecurity to time latency issues with data computation as well as delivery to\nend users. Fog computing has emerged as an extension for cloud computing to\nbring data processing and storage close to end-users; however, it minimizes the\ntime latency issue but still suffers from data security challenges. For\ninstance, when a fog node providing services to end users is compromised, the\nusers' data security can be violated. Thus, this paper proposes a secure and\nfine-grained data access control scheme by integrating the CP-ABE algorithm and\nblockchain concept to prevent fog nodes from violating end users' data security\nin a situation where a compromised fog node is being ousted. We also classify\nthe fog nodes into fog federations, based on their attributes such as services\nand locations, to minimize the time latency and communication overhead between\nfog nodes and cloud server. Further, the exploitation and integration of the\nblockchain concept and the CP-ABE algorithm enables fog nodes in the same fog\nfederation to perform the authorization process in a distributed manner. In\naddition, to solve time latency and communication overhead problems, we equip\nevery fog node with an off-chain database to store most frequently accessed\ndata files for specific time, and with an on-chain access control policies\ntable (On-chain Files Tracking Table) which must be protected from being\ntampered by malicious (rogue) fog nodes. Therefore, blockchain plays a vital\nrole here as it is tamper-proof by nature. We demonstrate our scheme's\nefficiency and feasibility by designing algorithms and conducting a security\nanalysis.

Numerical\nanalysis shows that, on average, the game takes between 69 and 123 rounds to\ncomplete, depending on the number of players.

It\nenables characterization of atomic scale structural dynamics that dictates the\nmacroscopic properties of various disordered material systems. Central to the\nexperimental concept are x-ray optics that are capable of splitting individual\ncoherent femtosecond x-ray pulse into two distinct pulses, introduce an\nadjustable time delay between them, and then recombine the two pulses at the\nsample position such that they generate two coherent scattering patterns in\nrapid succession. Recent developments in such optics showed that, while true\n'amplitude splitting' optics at hard x-ray wavelengths remains a technical\nchallenge, wavefront and wavelength splitting are both feasible, able to\ndeliver two micron sized focused beams to the sample with sufficient relative\nstability. Here, we however show that the conventional approach to speckle\nvisibility spectroscopy using these beam splitting techniques can be\nproblematic, even leading to a decoupling of speckle visibility and material\ndynamics. In response, we discuss the details of the experimental approaches\nand data analysis protocols for addressing issues caused by subtle beam\ndissimilarities for both wavefront and wavelength splitting setups. We also\nshow that in some scattering geometries, the Q-space mismatch can be resolved\nby using two beams of slightly different incidence angle and slightly different\nwavelengths at the same time. Instead of measuring the visibility of weak\nspeckle patterns, the time correlation in sample structure is encoded in the\n'side band' of the spatial autocorrelation of the summed speckle patterns, and\ncan be retrieved straightforwardly from the experimental data.

One\nimportant requirement of exploration is the {\\em termination} condition, i.e.,\nthe robots must know that exploration is completed. The problem of live\nexploration of a dynamic ring using mobile robots was recently introduced in\n[Di Luna et al., ICDCS 2016]. In it, they proposed multiple algorithms to solve\nexploration in fully synchronous and semi-synchronous settings with various\nguarantees when $2$ robots were involved. They also provided guarantees that\nwith certain assumptions, exploration of the ring using two robots was\nimpossible. An important question left open was how the presence of $3$ robots\nwould affect the results. In this paper, we try to settle this question in a\nfully synchronous setting and also show how to extend our results to a\nsemi-synchronous setting.\n  In particular, we present algorithms for exploration with explicit\ntermination using $3$ robots in conjunction with either (i) unique IDs of the\nrobots and edge crossing detection capability (i.e., two robots moving in\nopposite directions through an edge in the same round can detect each other),\nor (ii) access to randomness. The time complexity of our deterministic\nalgorithm is asymptotically optimal. We also provide complementary\nimpossibility results showing that there does not exist any explicit\ntermination algorithm for $2$ robots. The theoretical analysis and\ncomprehensive simulations of our algorithm show the effectiveness and\nefficiency of the algorithm in dynamic rings.

Physics-informed neural networks is an\nexample of this philosophy in which the outputs of deep neural networks are\nconstrained to approximately satisfy a given set of partial differential\nequations. In this work we review recent advances in scientific machine\nlearning with a specific focus on the effectiveness of physics-informed neural\nnetworks in predicting outcomes of physical systems and discovering hidden\nphysics from noisy data.

The paper aims to provide an efficient and accurate detection\nsystem for small lung nodules while keeping good performance for large nodules.\nMethods: We propose a multi-planar detection system using convolutional neural\nnetworks. The 2-D convolutional neural network model, U-net++, was trained by\naxial, coronal, and sagittal slices for the candidate detection task. All\npossible nodule candidates from the three different planes are combined. For\nfalse positive reduction, we apply 3-D multi-scale dense convolutional neural\nnetworks to efficiently remove false positive candidates. We use the public\nLIDC-IDRI dataset which includes 888 CT scans with 1186 nodules annotated by\nfour radiologists. Results: After ten-fold cross-validation, our proposed\nsystem achieves a sensitivity of 94.2% with 1.0 false positive/scan and a\nsensitivity of 96.0% with 2.0 false positives/scan. Although it is difficult to\ndetect small nodules (i.e. < 6 mm), our designed CAD system reaches a\nsensitivity of 93.4% (95.0%) of these small nodules at an overall false\npositive rate of 1.0 (2.0) false positives/scan. At the nodule candidate\ndetection stage, results show that a multi-planar method is capable to detect\nmore nodules compared to using a single plane. Conclusion: Our approach\nachieves good performance not only for small nodules, but also for large\nlesions on this dataset.

Bayesian\napproaches allow us to determine how likely an estimation of the unknown\nparameters is via formulating the posterior distribution. Unfortunately, it is\noften not possible to formulate a prior distribution that precisely encodes our\nprior knowledge about the unknown. Furthermore, adherence to handcrafted priors\nmay greatly bias the outcome of the Bayesian analysis. To address this issue,\nwe propose to use the functional form of a randomly initialized convolutional\nneural network as an implicit structured prior, which is shown to promote\nnatural images and excludes images with unnatural noise.

In\naddition, an excellent mechanical strength, nearly 40-50 % compared to bulk\nsilica, was also harvested in silica hybrid NPB.

Although a lot of\nresearch has been carried out in this field, the underlying mechanisms of these\ncomplex phenomena are not clearly understood yet, resulting in a challenge in\nthe design and use of modern aircraft. This review summarizes the recent\ninvestigations on nonclassical transonic aeroelastic problems, including\ntransonic buzz, reduction of transonic buffet onset, transonic buffeting\nresponse and frequency lock-in phenomenon in transonic buffet flow. After\nintroducing the research methods in unsteady aerodynamics and aeroelastic\nproblems, the dynamical characteristics as well as the physical mechanisms of\nthese phenomena are discussed from the perspective of the fluid mode. In the\nframework of the ROM (reduced order model) -based model, the dominant fluid\nmode (or the eigenvalue) and its coupling process with the structural model can\nbe clearly captured. The flow nonlinearity was believed to be the cause of the\ncomplexity of transonic aeroelasticity. In fact, this review indicates that the\ncomplexity lies in the decrease of the flow stability in the transonic regime.\nIn this condition, the fluid mode becomes a principal part of the coupling\nprocess, which results in the instability of the fluid mode itself or the\nstructural mode, and thus, it is the root cause of different transonic\naeroelastic phenomena.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jan 2020 04:43:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-11"}

Malicious users referred to as \"pathogenic social\nmedia\" (PSM) accounts are more likely to amplify this phenomena by spreading\nmisinformation to viral proportions. Understanding the spread of misinformation\nfrom account-level perspective is thus a pressing problem. In this work, we aim\nto present a feature-driven approach to detect PSM accounts in social media.\nInspired by the literature, we set out to assess PSMs from three broad\nperspectives: (1) user-related information (e.g., user activity, profile\ncharacteristics), (2) source-related information (i.e., information linked via\nURLs shared by users) and (3) content-related information (e.g., tweets\ncharacteristics). For the user-related information, we investigate malicious\nsignals using causality analysis (i.e., if user is frequently a cause of viral\ncascades) and profile characteristics (e.g., number of followers, etc.). For\nthe source-related information, we explore various malicious properties linked\nto URLs (e.g., URL address, content of the associated website, etc.). Finally,\nfor the content-related information, we examine attributes (e.g., number of\nhashtags, suspicious hashtags, etc.) from tweets posted by users. Experiments\non real-world Twitter data from different countries demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed approach in identifying PSM users.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jan 2020 04:50:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-15"}

Why these two\nX-class flares occurred in the same position with similar magnetic\nconfigurations, but one is eruptive while the other is not? Here we track the\ncoronal magnetic field evolution via nonlinear force-free field extrapolations\nfrom a time sequence of vector magnetograms with high cadence. A detailed\nanalysis of the magnetic field shows that a magnetic flux rope (MFR) forms and\ngrows gradually before the first flare, and shortly afterwards, the MFR's\ngrowth is significantly enhanced with a much faster rise in height, from far\nbelow the threshold of torus instability to above it, while the magnetic twist\nonly increases mildly.

We thus\nsuggest a scenario to interpret the occurrence of the two flares. The first\nflare occurred since the MFR reached a high enough height to activate the null\npoint, and its continuous expansion forces the null-point reconnection\nrecurrently. Such reconnection weakens the overlying field, allowing the MFR to\nrise faster, which eventually crosses the threshold of torus instability and\ntriggers the second, eruptive flare.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jan 2020 05:35:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-19"}

Most existing approaches replace an outlier-prone Gaussian\nlikelihood with a non-Gaussian likelihood induced from a heavy tail\ndistribution, such as the Laplace distribution and Student-t distribution.\nHowever, the use of a non-Gaussian likelihood would incur the need for a\ncomputationally expensive Bayesian approximate computation in the posterior\ninferences. The proposed approach models an outlier as a noisy and biased\nobservation of an unknown regression function, and accordingly, the likelihood\ncontains bias terms to explain the degree of deviations from the regression\nfunction. We entail how the biases can be estimated accurately with other\nhyperparameters by a regularized maximum likelihood estimation. Conditioned on\nthe bias estimates, the robust GP regression can be reduced to a standard GP\nregression problem with analytical forms of the predictive mean and variance\nestimates. Therefore, the proposed approach is simple and very computationally\nattractive. It also gives a very robust and accurate GP estimate for many\ntested scenarios. For the numerical evaluation, we perform a comprehensive\nsimulation study to evaluate the proposed approach with the comparison to the\nexisting robust GP approaches under various simulated scenarios of different\noutlier proportions and different noise levels. The approach is applied to data\nfrom two measurement systems, where the predictors are based on robust\nenvironmental parameter measurements and the response variables utilize more\ncomplex chemical sensing methods that contain a certain percentage of outliers.\nThe utility of the measurement systems and value of the environmental data are\nimproved through the computationally efficient GP regression and bias model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jan 2020 06:21:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-15"}

By considering observers located at various positions in\nthe heliosphere, we investigate how drifts may alter the measured\nintensity-time profiles and energy spectra. We focus on the decay phase of\nsolar energetic proton events during which a temporal invariant spectrum and\ndisappearing spatial intensity gradients are often observed; a phenomenon known\nas the 'reservoir effect' or the 'SEP flood'. We study the effects of drifts by\nsolving the focused transport equation for nominal Parker solar wind\nconfigurations and for a magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) generated solar wind\ncontaining a corotating interaction region (CIR). The latter configuration\ncontains a magnetic bottle structure, with one bottleneck at the Sun and the\nother at the CIR. It is illustrated that observers magnetically connected close\nto the edges of the particle injection site can experience, as a result of\ndrifts, a sudden drop in the intensities occurring at different times for\ndifferent energies such that no SEP flood phenomenon is established. In the\nmagnetic bottle, this effect is enhanced due to the presence of magnetic field\ngradients strengthening the nominal particle drifts. We also show that\ninterplanetary cross-field diffusion may mitigate these effects of drifts. We\nconclude that particle drifts can in some cases substantially modify the decay\nphase of SEP events, especially if the solar wind contains compression regions\nor shock waves where the drifts are enhanced. This is, for example, the case\nfor our CIR solar wind configuration generated with a 3D MHD model, where the\neffect of drifts is strong. A similar decay rate in different energy channels\nand for different observers requires thus the mitigation of the effect of\ndrifts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jan 2020 08:10:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-12"}

Our method\nmakes it possible to introduce two or three layers in the normal directions\nwith a reasonable approximation. Analytical solutions for uniform grain-fluid\nflows over inclined planes, with and without side wall friction, are calculated\nand compared to the proposed model. In the numerical results, we observe that\nthe proposed model with a two layer description of the mixture accurately\nrepresents the velocity measured at the surface of the mixture in the\nlaboratory experiments. This is obviously poorly represented by the\ndepth-averaged velocity in single-layer models. Our numerical results show a\nsignificant impact of the parameters involved in dilatancy law, in particular\non the calculation of the time evolution of the excess pore fluid pressure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jan 2020 09:06:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

The ratio between currents\nin full- and empty-energy states below the critical temperature reaches as high\nas 109, with an external quantum efficiency of 4410000% during optical\ncharging. A theoretical model developed to explain the mechanism of this effect\nis in good agreement with the experimental data. This work paves a path towards\nstorage-type photoconductors and high-efficiency entropy-decreasing devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jan 2020 10:10:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-15"}

Transverse momentum-dependent skew tunneling of Cooper pairs\nthrough the spin-active ferromagnetic insulator interface creates sizable\ntransverse Hall supercurrents, to which we refer as anomalous Josephson Hall\neffect currents. We generalize the Furusaki-Tsukada formula, which got\ninitially established to quantify usual (tunneling) Josephson current flows, to\nevaluate the transverse current components and demonstrate that their\namplitudes are widely adjustable by means of the spin-orbit coupling strengths\nor the superconducting phase difference across the junction.

Therefore a proper\nsurface passivation is required for ZMWs, but information is currently lacking\non both the nature of the adhesion phenomenon and the optimization of the\ndifferent passivation protocols. Here we monitor the influence of the\nfluorescent dye (Alexa Fluor 546 and 647, Atto 550 and 647N) on the\nnon-specific adhesion of double stranded DNA molecule. We show that the\nnonspecific adhesion of DNA double strands onto the ZMW surface is directly\nmediated by the organic fluorescent dye being used, as Atto 550 and Atto 647N\nshow a pronounced tendency to adhere to the ZMW while the Alexa Fluor 546 and\n647 are remarkably free of this effect.

We complement these data with Chandra and\nXMM-Newton X-ray observations. In our sensitive images, we discover radio halos\nin both clusters. In Abell S1063, a giant radio halo is found with a size of\n$\\sim 1.2$ Mpc. The integrated spectral index between 325 MHz and 1.5 GHz is\n$-0.94\\pm0.08$ and it steepens to $-1.77 \\pm 0.20$ between 1.5 and 3.0 GHz.\nThis spectral steepening provides support for the turbulent re-acceleration\nmodel for radio halo formation. Abell 370 hosts a faint radio halo mostly\ncentred on the southern part of this binary merging cluster, with a size of\n$\\sim 500-700$ kpc. The spectral index between 325 MHz and 1.5 GHz is\n$-1.10\\pm0.09$. Both radio halos follow the known scaling relation between the\ncluster mass proxy $Y_{500}$ and radio power, consistent with the idea that\nthey are related to ongoing cluster merger events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jan 2020 11:40:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-08"}

We propose a decentralized\nversion of strong detectability called co-detectability which implies that once\na system satisfies this property, for each generated infinite-length event\nsequence, at least one local observer can determine the current and subsequent\nstates after a common observation time delay.

Secondly, the propagating\nmechanism of C-J deflagration is discussed. For the C-J deflagration with a\npropagating velocity of about 1/2 C-J detonation, the static temperature behind\nthe leading shock wave is too low to ignite the combustion. But, the total\ntemperature of the flow induced by the leading shock wave is high enough to\nignite the mixture. The induced flow is slowed down by the rarefaction waves\nform the wall and its static temperature increases. The flame and the leading\nshock wave propagate with almost the same velocity and the double-discontinuity\nstructure of the flow field keeps stable.

Over\nland, surface temperatures vary more strongly, and rain rate is significantly\ninfluenced.

Already on the second day,\nthe rain field is firmly structured. In later days, the clustering becomes\nstronger and alternates from day-to-day.

There is one such ODE for each decaying exponential, and the\nintroduction of these ODEs means that the Volterra integral can be removed from\nthe governing equation. The two types of internal variable are distinguished by\nwhether the unknown appears in the Volterra integral, or whether its time\nderivative appears; we call the resulting problems the displacement and\nvelocity forms. We define fully discrete formulations for each of these forms\nby using continuous Galerkin finite element approximations in space and an\nimplicit `Crank-Nicolson' type of finite difference method in time.

In\na slotted discrete-time model, the sensor, exclusively powered by randomly\navailable harvested energy, obtains a sample and computes the log-likelihood\nratio of the two distributions if it has enough energy to sense and process a\nsample. If it does not have enough energy in a given slot, it waits until it\nharvests enough energy to perform the task in a future time slot. We derive\nasymptotic expressions for the expected detection delay (when a change actually\noccurs), and the asymptotic tail distribution of the run-length to a false\nalarm (when a change never happens). We show that when the average harvested\nenergy ($\\bar H$) is greater than or equal to the energy required to sense and\nprocess a sample ($E_s$), standard existing asymptotic results for the CUSUM\ntest apply since the energy storage level at the sensor is greater than $E_s$\nafter a sufficiently long time.

Extreme value modelling provides various competing predictors for\nthis point prediction problem. A common method of assessment of a set of\ncompeting predictors is to evaluate their predictive performance in a given\nsituation. However, due to the extreme nature of this inference problem, it can\nbe possible that the predicted quantiles are not seen in the historical\nrecords, particularly when the sample size is small. This situation poses a\nproblem to the validation of the prediction with its realisation. In this\narticle, we propose two non-parametric scoring approaches to assess extreme\nquantile prediction mechanisms. The proposed assessment methods are based on\npredicting a sequence of equally extreme quantiles on different parts of the\ndata. We then use the quantile scoring function to evaluate the competing\npredictors. The performance of the scoring methods is compared with the\nconventional scoring method and the superiority of the former methods are\ndemonstrated in a simulation study.

This\nstudy investigates the impacts of rising sea levels on salinity intrusion in\nsalt-wedge estuaries. The sea-level rise impacts are assessed in idealized\nestuaries using simple expressions derived from a two-layer hydraulic theory,\nand in the Neretva River Estuary in Croatia using a two-layer time-dependent\nmodel. The assessment is based on three indicators - the salt-wedge intrusion\nlength, the seawater volume, and the river inflows needed to restore the\nbaseline intrusion. The potential SLR was found to increase all three\nconsidered indicators. Theoretical analysis in idealized estuaries suggests\nthat shallower estuaries are more sensitive to SLR. Numerical results for the\nNeretva River Estuary showed that SLR may increase salt-wedge intrusion length,\nvolume, and corrective river inflow. However, the results are highly non-linear\nbecause of the channel geometry, especially for lower river inflows. A\ntheoretical assessment of channel bed slope impacts on limiting a potential\nintrusion is therefore additionally discussed.

We manage to evaluate the average AoI of the proposed ADRA protocol\nmathematically by decoupling the tangled AoI evolution of multiple IoT devices\nand modeling the decoupled AoI evolution of each device as a Discrete-Time\nMarkov Chain.

Maddah-Ali and Niesen proposed a two-phase\n(placement phase and delivery phase) coded caching strategy for broadcast\nchannels with cache-aided users. This paper investigates the same model under\nthe constraint that content is placed uncoded within the caches, that is, when\nbits of the files are simply copied within the caches. When the cache contents\nare uncoded and the users' demands are revealed, the caching problem can be\nconnected to an index coding problem. This paper focuses on deriving\nfundamental performance limits for the caching problem by using tools for the\nindex coding problem that were either known or are newly developed in this\nwork. First, a converse bound for the caching problem under the constraint of\nuncoded cache placement is proposed based on the \"acyclic index coding converse\nbound\". This converse bound is proved to be achievable by the Maddah-Ali and\nNiesen's scheme when the number of files is not less than the number of users,\nand by a newly derived index coding achievable scheme otherwise. The proposed\nindex coding achievable scheme is based on distributed source coding and\nstrictly improves on the widely used \"composite (index) coding\" achievable\nbound and its improvements, and is of independent interest. An important\nconsequence of the findings of this paper is that advancements on the coded\ncaching problem posed by Maddah-Ali and Niesen are thus only possible by\nconsidering strategies with coded placement phase. A recent work by Yu et al.\nhas however shown that coded cache placement can at most half the network load\ncompared to the results presented in this paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jan 2020 14:42:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-15"}

The\nX-bond strength increases with the atomic number of the halogen involved, thus\nfor heavier halogens, relativistic effects become of concern. This poses a\nchallenge for the quantum chemical description of X-bonded complexes.

(2) how to transfer good performed knowledge tracing model between\ndomains. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel adaptable framework,\nnamely adaptable knowledge tracing (AKT) to address the DAKT problem.\nSpecifically, for the first aspect, we incorporate the educational\ncharacteristics (e.g., slip, guess, question texts) based on the deep knowledge\ntracing (DKT) to obtain a good performed knowledge tracing model.

Third, we adopt fine-tuning to deal with the problem that the\noutput dimension of source and target domain are different to make the model\nsuitable for target domains.

As the\nfirst step of this research, we performed simulation of energy spectrum from\nradiotherapy units (spectrum model). The next step was the modeling of linear\naccelerator head and X-ray tube, and the distribution of dose in the water\nphantom (PDD model). At the second stage, dose changes were investigated in the\npresence of cisplatin in the target (CIS model). The simulation results showed\nthat the dose escalation can be caused by photon-capture therapy (PCT). There\nis a dose enhancement in the volume where cisplatin is accumulated. Then higher\nis concentration, then higher is the effect. However, the photon energy\nincrease from 60 to 250 kV and increase of depth of target reduces the effect\nof PCT due the decrease of the photoelectric effect cross-section. Should be\nnoticed, that the orthovoltage X-rays energy, listed in the table with results\nshows higher dose enhancement, than the megavoltage photon beam generated from\nlinear acceleration sources. In addition, that the dose enhancement factors\n(DEF) are higher in linac without flattening filter, than in linac with\nflattening filter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jan 2020 15:17:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

It was the basis\nof the Higher Deficiency Algorithm for mass action systems of Ji and Feinberg,\nand the Multistationarity Algorithm for power-law kinetic systems of Hernandez\net al. In addition to our previous work, we provide important properties of the\nindependence (i.e., the network's stoichiometric subspace is the direct sum of\nthe subnetworks' stoichiometric subspaces) and the incidence-independence\n(i.e., the image of the network's incidence map is the direct sum of the\nincidence maps' images of the subnetworks) of these decompositions. Feinberg\nestablished the essential relationship between independent decompositions and\nthe set of positive equilibria of a network, which we call the Feinberg\nDecomposition Theorem (FDT). Moreover, Farinas et al. recently documented its\nversion for incidence-independence. Fundamental decomposition divides the\nnetwork into subnetworks of deficiency either 0 or 1 only. Hence, available\nresults for lower deficiency networks, such as the Deficiency Zero Theorem\n(DZT), can be used. These justify the study of independent fundamental\ndecompositions. A MATLAB program which (i) computes the subnetworks of a CRN\nunder the fundamental decomposition and (ii) is useful for determining whether\nthe decomposition is independent and incidence-independent is also created.\nFinally, we provide the following solution for determining multistationarity of\nCRNs with the following steps: (1) the use of the program, (2) the application\nof available results for CRNs with deficiency 0 or 1 (e.g., DZT), and (3) the\nuse of FDT.

In this paper,\nwe propose a novel Cloud Security Risk Management Framework (CSRMF) that helps\norganizations adopting CC identify, analyze, evaluate, and mitigate security\nrisks in their Cloud platforms. Unlike traditional risk management frameworks,\nCSRMF is driven by the business objectives of the organizations. It allows any\norganization adopting CC to be aware of cloud security risks and align their\nlow-level management decisions according to high-level business objectives. In\nessence, it is designed to address impacts of cloud-specific security risks\ninto business objectives in a given organization. Consequently, organizations\nare able to conduct a cost-value analysis regarding the adoption of CC\ntechnology and gain an adequate level of confidence in Cloud technology.

In this context,\nsmart mobility systems aim to support the efficient exploitation of the city\ntransport facilities as well as sustainable mobility within the urban\nenvironment. People need to travel quickly and conveniently between locations\nat different scales, ranging from a trip of a few blocks within a city to a\njourney across cities or further. At the same time, goods need to be timely\ndelivered considering the needs of both the users and the businesses. While\nmost of the mobility and delivery solutions can cover significant distances and\nmultiple requests, they suffer when the requests come from the growing\nneighborhoods and hard-to-reach areas such as city centers, corporate\nheadquarters, and hospitals. In the last few years, several cities indicated\ninterest in using Autonomous Vehicles (AV) for the \"last-mile\" mobility\nservices. With them, it seems to be easier to get people and goods around using\nfewer vehicles. In this context, Autonomous Shuttles (AS) are beginning to be\nthought of as a new mobility/delivery service into the city center where narrow\nstreets are not easily served by traditional buses. They allow them to serve\ncritical areas with minimal new infrastructure and reducing noise and\npollution. The goal of this article is to present an innovative vision on the\nintroduction of the Autonomous Shuttles-as-a service (ASaaS) concept as the key\npillar for the realization of innovative and sustainable proximity mobility.\nThrough a set of real application scenarios, we present our view, and we\ndiscuss a set of challenges, opportunities, and social implications that this\nway to reimage the mobility of the future introduces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 14 Jan 2020 12:34:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-28"}

A challenge in using EHR data is that\nselecting cohorts of patients often requires information in unstructured parts\nof the record. Machine learning has been used to address this, but even\nhigh-performing algorithms may select patients in a non-random manner and bias\nthe resulting cohort. To improve the efficiency of cohort selection while\nmeasuring potential bias, we introduce a technique called Model-Assisted Cohort\nSelection (MACS) with Bias Analysis and apply it to the selection of metastatic\nbreast cancer (mBC) patients. Materials and Methods We trained a model on\n17,263 patients using term-frequency inverse-document-frequency (TF-IDF) and\nlogistic regression. We used a test set of 17,292 patients to measure algorithm\nperformance and perform Bias Analysis. We compared the cohort generated by MACS\nto the cohort that would have been generated without MACS as reference\nstandard, first by comparing distributions of an extensive set of clinical and\ndemographic variables and then by comparing the results of two analyses\naddressing existing example research questions. Results Our algorithm had an\narea under the curve (AUC) of 0.976, a sensitivity of 96.0%, and an abstraction\nefficiency gain of 77.9%. During Bias Analysis, we found no large differences\nin baseline characteristics and no differences in the example analyses.\nConclusion MACS with bias analysis can significantly improve the efficiency of\ncohort selection on EHR data while instilling confidence that outcomes research\nperformed on the resulting cohort will not be biased.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 13 Jan 2020 22:58:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-28"}

After turning off the voltage\nproximately at a half of precession period, the magnetization relaxes to the\nopposite equilibrium direction. We perform numerical simulations and show that\nthe pulse duration of the proposed switching scheme is as short as a few tens\nof pico seconds.

Particular attention is\npaid to the interface conditions imposed between the electrolyte and the active\nelectrode material; necessary conditions are derived for one of these, the\nButler-Volmer relation, in order to ensure physically realistic solutions.\nInsight into the origin of the differences between various models found in the\nliterature is revealed by considering formulations obtained by using different\nmeasures of the electric potential. Materials commonly used for electrodes in\nlithium ion batteries are considered and the various mathematical models used\nto describe lithium transport in them discussed. The problem of up-scaling from\nmodels of behaviour at the single electrode particle scale to the cell scale is\naddressed using homogenisation techniques resulting in the pseudo 2D model\ncommonly used to describe charge transport and discharge behaviour in\nlithium-ion cells.
