A rich\nphase diagram is found in the anisotropy-coupling strength plane by calculating\nseveral observables. There are three distinct quantum phases: a delocalized\nphase with even parity (phase I), a delocalized phase with odd parity (phase\nII), and a localized phase with broken $Z_2$ symmetry (phase III), which\nintersect at a quantum tricritical point. The competition between those phases\nwould give overall picture of the phase diagram. For small power of the\nspectral function of the bosonic bath, the quantum phase transition (QPT) from\nphase I to III with mean-field critical behavior is present, similar to the\nisotropic SBM. The novel phase diagram full with three different phases can be\nfound at large power of the spectral function: For highly anisotropic case, the\nsystem experiences the QPTs from phase I to II via 1st-order, and then to the\nphase III via 2nd-order with the increase of the coupling strength. For low\nanisotropic case, the system only experiences the continuous QPT from phase I\nto phase III with the non-mean-field critical exponents. Very interestingly, at\nthe moderate anisotropy, the system would display the continuous QPTs for\nseveral times but with the same critical exponents.

The observation covers 48min at a\ncadence of 2s targeting a Quiet Sun region at disk-centre. Corresponding time\nseries of brightness temperature maps are constructed with the first version of\nthe Solar ALMA Pipeline (SoAP) and compared to simultaneous SDO observations.\nThe angular resolution of the observations is set by the synthesized beam\n(1.4x2.1as). The ALMA maps exhibit network patches, internetwork regions and\nalso elongated thin features that are connected to large-scale magnetic loops\nas confirmed by a comparison with SDO maps. The ALMA Band 3 maps correlate best\nwith the SDO/AIA 171, 131 and 304 channels in that they exhibit network\nfeatures and, although very weak in the ALMA maps, imprints of large-scale\nloops. A group of compact magnetic loops is very clearly visible in ALMA Band\n3. The brightness temperatures in the loop tops reach values of about\n8000-9000K and in extreme moments up to 10 000K. ALMA Band 3 interferometric\nobservations from early observing cycles already reveal temperature differences\nin the solar chromosphere. The weak imprint of magnetic loops and the\ncorrelation with the 171, 131, and 304 SDO channels suggests though that the\nradiation mapped in ALMA Band 3 might have contributions from a larger range of\natmospheric heights than previously assumed but the exact formation height of\nBand 3 needs to be investigated in more detail. The absolute brightness\ntemperature scale as set by Total Power measurements remains less certain and\nmust be improved in the future. Despite these complications and the limited\nangular resolution, ALMA Band 3 observations have large potential for\nquantitative studies of the small-scale structure and dynamics of the solar\nchromosphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jan 2020 17:16:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-11"}

We use cosmological simulations of a 'Milky Way' to argue\nthat the different tracks of the halo stars through the [$\\alpha$/Fe]-[Fe/H]\nplane are due to a difference in their star formation history and efficiency,\nwith the lower mass GES having its low and constant star formation regulated by\nfeedback whilst the higher mass main progenitor has a higher star formation\nrate prior to the merger. The lower star formation efficiency of GES leads to\nlower gas pollution levels, pushing [$\\alpha$/Fe]-[Fe/H] tracks to the left. In\naddition, the increasing star formation rate maintains a higher relative\ncontribution of Type~II SNe to Type~Ia SNe for the main progenitor population\nthat formed during the same time period, thus maintaining a relatively high\n[$\\alpha$/Fe]. Thus the different positions of the downturns in the\n[$\\alpha$/Fe]-[Fe/H] plane for the GES stars are not reflective of different\nstar formation durations, but instead reflect different star formation\nefficiencies.

Multiple connection paths are exploited for each\nconnection request while entanglement fidelity is ensured for each path by\nperforming entanglement purification. The routing scheme is highly modularized\nwith a flexible nature, embedding quantum operations within the algorithmic\nworkflow, whose performance is evaluated from multiple perspectives. In\nparticular, three algorithms are proposed and compared for the scheduling of\ncapacity allocation on the edges of quantum network. Embodying the ideas of\nproportional share and progressive filling that have been well-studied in\nclassical routing problems, we design a new scheduling algorithm, the\npropagatory update method, which in certain aspects overrides the two\nalgorithms based on classical heuristics in scheduling performances. The\ngeneral solution scheme paves the road for effective design of efficient\nrouting and flow control protocols on applicational quantum networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jan 2020 18:16:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

Despite this benefit of the fcc phase, high\ngrain boundary scattering results in increased resistivity compared to Cu-based\ninterconnects with similar average grain size. We find, however, that the line\nresistance of fcc Ru is lower than that of Cu below 21 nm line width due to the\nconductor volume lost to adhesion and wetting liners. In addition to studying\nbulk transport properties, we evaluate the performance of adhesion liners for\nfcc Ru. We find that it is energetically more favorable for fcc Ru to bind\ndirectly to silicon dioxide than through conventional adhesion liners such as\nTaN and TiN. In the case that a thin liner is necessary for the Ru deposition\ntechnique, we find that the vertical resistance penalty of a liner for fcc Ru\ncan be up to eight times lower than that calculated for conventional liners\nused for Cu interconnects.

Some FRB sources exhibit repeat bursts. Though over a hundred FRB\nsources have been discovered to date, only four have been localised and\nassociated with a host galaxy, with just one of the four known to repeat. The\nproperties of the host galaxies, and the local environments of FRBs, provide\nimportant clues about their physical origins. However, the first known\nrepeating FRB has been localised to a low-metallicity, irregular dwarf galaxy,\nand the apparently non-repeating sources to higher-metallicity, massive\nelliptical or star-forming galaxies, suggesting that perhaps the repeating and\napparently non-repeating sources could have distinct physical origins.

This study\ncan be easily used to determine the underlying jet structure, significantly\nreduce the effective parameter space for numerical fitting attempts and provide\nphysical insights. As an illustration, we show that for GRB 170817A, there is a\nstrong correlation between the allowed values of $\\Gamma_{\\rm c,0}$ and $b$,\nleading to a narrow strip of allowed solutions in the $\\Gamma_{\\rm c,0}$-$b$\nplane above some minimal values $\\Gamma_{\\rm c,0}\\gtrsim 40, b\\gtrsim1.2$.\nFurthermore, the Lorentz factor of the material dominating the early lightcurve\ncan be constrained by three independent techniques to be\n$\\Gamma_{0}(\\theta_{\\rm min,0})\\approx5-7$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jan 2020 19:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Mar 2020 19:27:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-06"}

A\nrepresentative one-hour dataset under a stable atmosphere is selected for the\ncharacterization, including the inflow turbulent data measured from the\nmeteorological tower, high-resolution blade strain measurement at different\ncircumferential and radiation positions along the blade, and the wind turbine\noperational conditions. The results indicate that the turbulent inflow\nmodulates the turbine blade structural response in three representative\nfrequency ranges: a lower frequency range (corresponding to modulations due to\nlarge eddies in the atmosphere), a higher frequency range (corresponding to\nflow structures in scales smaller than the rotor diameter), and an\nintermediate-range in between. The blade structure responds strongly to the\nturbulent inflow in the lower and intermediate ranges, while it is primarily\ndominated by the rotation effect and other high-frequency characteristics of\nwind turbines in the higher frequency range. Moreover, the blade structural\nbehaviors at different azimuth angles, circumferential and radial locations\nalong the blade are also compared, suggesting the comparatively high\npossibility of structural failure at certain positions. Further, the present\nstudy also uncovers the linkage between the turbulent inflow and blade\nstructural response using temporal correlation.

In this paper, we present a\nunified formulation of these two constructs, where a scene graph is seen as an\nimage-conditioned instantiation of a commonsense knowledge graph. Based on this\nnew perspective, we re-formulate scene graph generation as the inference of a\nbridge between the scene and commonsense graphs, where each entity or predicate\ninstance in the scene graph has to be linked to its corresponding entity or\npredicate class in the commonsense graph. To this end, we propose a novel\ngraph-based neural network that iteratively propagates information between the\ntwo graphs, as well as within each of them, while gradually refining their\nbridge in each iteration. Our Graph Bridging Network, GB-Net, successively\ninfers edges and nodes, allowing to simultaneously exploit and refine the rich,\nheterogeneous structure of the interconnected scene and commonsense graphs.\nThrough extensive experimentation, we showcase the superior accuracy of GB-Net\ncompared to the most recent methods, resulting in a new state of the art.

This shows a\ncapability to selectively amplify quantum fluctuations with a predetermined\nmomentum, where the momentum value can be spectroscopically tuned. A classical\nexternal field that excites pairs of particles with the same energy but\nopposite momenta is reminiscent of the coherently-driven nonlinearity in a\nparametric amplifier crystal in nonlinear optics. For this reason, it may be\nanticipated that the evolution will generate a squeezed matter-wave state in\nthe quasiparticle mode on resonance with the modulation frequency.

This outcome results from advances in physics that\nallow storage of more than one bit per cell, coupled with advances in signal\nprocessing that reduce the effect of physical instabilities. Constrained codes\nare used in storage to avoid problematic patterns. Recently, we introduced\nbinary symmetric lexicographically-ordered constrained codes (LOCO codes) for\ndata storage and data transmission. This paper introduces simple constrained\ncodes that support non-binary physical substrates; multi, triple, quad, and the\ncurrently-in-development penta-level cell (M/T/Q/P-LC) Flash memories. The new\ncodes can be easily modified if problematic patterns change with time. These\ncodes are designed to mitigate inter-cell interference, which is a critical\nsource of error in Flash devices. The occurrence of errors is a consequence of\nparasitic capacitances in and across floating gate transistors, resulting in\ncharge propagation from cells being programmed to the highest charge level to\nneighboring cells being programmed to lower levels. The new codes are called\n$q$-ary asymmetric LOCO codes (QA-LOCO codes), and the construction subsumes\ncodes previously designed for single-level cell (SLC) Flash devices (A-LOCO\ncodes). QA-LOCO codes work for a Flash device with any number, $q$, of levels\nper cell. For $q \\geq 4$, we show that QA-LOCO codes can achieve rates greater\nthan $0.95 \\log_2 q$ information bits per coded symbol. The complexity of\nencoding and decoding is modest, and reconfiguring a code is as easy as\nreprogramming an adder. Capacity-achieving rates, affordable encoding-decoding\ncomplexity, and ease of reconfigurability support the growing development of\nM/T/Q/P-LC Flash memory devices, as well as lifecycle management as the\ncharacteristics of these devices change with time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jan 2020 00:48:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-09"}

The\nresearch challenge in speech emotion detection is defining the very meaning of\nstress and being able to categorize it in a precise manner. Supervised Machine\nLearning models, including state of the art Deep Learning classification\nmethods, rely on the availability of clean and labelled data. One of the\nproblems in affective computation and emotion detection is the limited amount\nof annotated data of stress.

The learnt\nemotion representations from the Emo-CNN are mapped to the cube using three\ncomponent PCA (Principal Component Analysis) which is then used to model human\nstress.

Hence living systems exert active stresses\non the complex environments in which they reside. One recurring aspect of this\ncomplexity is the viscoelasticity of the medium surrounding living systems:\nbacteria secrete their own viscoelastic extracellular matrix, and cells\nconstantly deform, proliferate, and self-propel within viscoelastic networks of\ncollagen. It is therefore imperative to understand how active matter modifies,\nand gets modified by, viscoelastic fluids. Here, we present a two-phase model\nof active nematic matter that dynamically interacts with a passive viscoelastic\npolymeric phase and perform numerical simulations in two dimensions to\nillustrate its applicability. Motivated by recent experiments we first study\nthe suppression of cell division by a viscoelastic medium surrounding the cell.\nWe further show that the self-propulsion of a model keratocyte cell is modified\nby the polymer relaxation of the surrounding viscoelastic fluid in a\nnon-uniform manner and find that increasing polymer viscosity effectively\nsuppresses the cell motility. Lastly, we explore the hampering impact of the\nviscoelastic medium on the generic hydrodynamic instabilities of active\nnematics by simulating the dynamics of an active stripe within a polymeric\nfluid. The model presented here can provide a framework for investigating more\ncomplex dynamics such as the interaction of multicellular growing systems with\nviscoelastic environments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jan 2020 01:15:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-27"}

This model allows the servers in the network to be heterogeneous, at the\nsame time combines and generalizes many classical JPA-VNF models. Despite its\nNP-hardness, we present a provable best-possible deterministic online algorithm\nbased on dynamic programming (DP). To conquer the high complexity of DP, we\npropose two additional randomized heuristics, the Las Vegas (LV) and Monte\nCarlo (MC) randomized algorithms, which performs even as good as DP with much\nsmaller complexity. Besides, MC is a promising heuristic in practice as it has\nthe advantage to deal with big data environment. Extensive numerical\nexperiments are constructed for the proposed algorithms in the paper.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jan 2020 03:07:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-09"}

Recently, deep learning networks have been widely used for various\nmedical image segmentation tasks, with U-Net and generative adversarial nets\n(GANs) being some of the commonly used ones. Foreground-background class\nimbalance is a common occurrence in medical images, and U-Net has difficulty in\nhandling class imbalance because of its cross entropy (CE) objective function.\nSimilarly, GAN also suffers from class imbalance because the discriminator\nlooks at the entire image to classify it as real or fake. Since the\ndiscriminator is essentially a deep learning classifier, it is incapable of\ncorrectly identifying minor changes in small structures. To address these\nissues, we propose a novel context based CE loss function for U-Net, and a\nnovel architecture Seg-GLGAN. The context based CE is a linear combination of\nCE obtained over the entire image and its region of interest (ROI). In\nSeg-GLGAN, we introduce a novel context discriminator to which the entire image\nand its ROI are fed as input, thus enforcing local context. We conduct\nextensive experiments using two challenging unbalanced datasets: PROMISE12 and\nACDC. We observe that segmentation results obtained from our methods give\nbetter segmentation metrics as compared to various baseline methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jan 2020 05:46:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-09"}

This work theoretically\nstudies the entrainment flow of a viscous jet emerging from a plane wall into a\nhalf space. Methods are developed to find physically meaningful similarity\nsolutions of the Navier-Stokes equations with finite values of mass and\nmomentum fluxes and having no characteristic size. Two models are considered:\nflow dominated by momentum flux and flow dominated by mass flux. A new\none-parameter set of momentum-dominated similarity solutions is found. Two\nlinearly independent mass-dominated similarity solutions are found. Algorithms\nare proposed to evaluate the parameters of the similarity models from the mass\nand momentum balances. Distributions of flow parameters and stresses at the\nwall are calculated for the similarity models. They are compared with the\ncorresponding distributions obtained by computational fluid dynamics for a more\nrealistic model with a finite size of the jet origin and competitive influence\nof the mass and momentum fluxes. Such comparison validates the mass-dominated\nsimilarity model at the jet Reynolds number Re <= 10 and the momentum-dominated\nsimilarity model at Re >= 30. The obtained results are applied to the problem\nof evaporation at selective laser melting. It is shown that the theoretically\nestimated flow velocity corresponds to the experimentally observed one.

Three of the donor stars\nare in an advanced evolutionary stage, while for some of the stars, the\nabundance pattern indicates that processed material might have been accreted.\nWhen passing by the NS in its tight orbit, the donor star wind has not yet\nreached its terminal velocity but it is still significantly slower; its speed\nis comparable with the orbital velocity of the NS companion. There are no\nsystematic differences between the two types of wind-fed HMXBs (persistent\nversus transients) with respect to the donor stars.

Using TCSPC, e.g., for the purpose of\nfluorescence lifetime measurements, is often limited in speed due to dead-time\nlosses and pile-up. We show that this limitation can be lifted by reducing the\ndead-time of the timing electronics to the absolute minimum imposed by the\nspeed of the detector signals while maintaining high temporal resolution. A\ncomplementing approach to speedy data acquisition is parallelization by means\nof simultaneous readout of many detector channels. This puts high demands on\nthe data throughput of the TCSPC system, especially in time tagging of\nindividual photon arrivals. Here, we present a new design approach, supporting\nup to 16 input channels, an extremely short dead-time of 650 ps, very high time\ntagging throughput, and a timing resolution of 80 ps. In order to facilitate\nremote synchronization of multiple such instruments with highest precision, the\nnew TCSPC electronics provide an interface for White Rabbit fiber optic\nnetworks. Beside fundamental research in the field of astronomy, such remote\nsynchronization tasks arise routinely in quantum communication networks with\nnode to node distances on the order of tens of kilometers. In addition to\nshowing design features and benchmark results of new TCSPC electronics, we\npresent application results from spectrally resolved and high-speed\nfluorescence lifetime imaging in medical research. We furthermore show how\npulse-pile-up occurring in the detector signals at high photon flux can be\ncorrected for and how this data acquisition scheme performs in terms of\naccuracy and efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jan 2020 09:43:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-09"}

For the geometries with strong photoelastic coupling LTB\ndemonstrates quite large acoustooptic performance with figure of merit value ,\n$M_2$ achieving 2.12 $\\times$ 10$^{-15}$ s$^3$/kg. It is several times larger\nthan that of strontium borate crystals, nowadays the best acoustooptic material\nin deep ultraviolet spectral region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jan 2020 12:23:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-09"}

Specifically, the IoT device as a\nsecondary user (SIoT), seeks and exploits the spectrum opportunities of the\nlicensed band vacated by its primary user (PU) to deliver status updates\nwithout causing visible effects to the licensed operation. In this context, the\nSIoT should carefully make use of the licensed band and schedule when to\ntransmit to maintain the timeliness of the status update. We adopt a recent\nmetric, Age of Information (AoI), to characterize the timeliness of the status\nupdate of the SIoT. We aim to minimize the long-term average AoI of the SIoT\nwhile satisfying the collision constraint imposed by the PU by formulating a\nconstrained Markov decision process (CMDP) problem. We first prove the\nexistence of optimal stationary policy of the CMDP problem. The optimal\nstationary policy (termed age-optimal policy) is shown to be a randomized\nsimple policy that randomizes between two deterministic policies with a fixed\nprobability. We prove that the two deterministic policies have a threshold\nstructure and further derive the closed-form expression of average AoI and\ncollision probability for the deterministic threshold-structured policy by\nconducting Markov Chain analysis. The analytical expression offers an efficient\nway to calculate the threshold and randomization probability to form the\nage-optimal policy. For comparison, we also consider the throughput\nmaximization policy (termed throughput-optimal policy) and analyze the average\nAoI performance under the throughput-optimal policy in the considered system.\nNumerical simulations show the superiority of the derived age-optimal policy\nover the throughput-optimal policy. We also unveil the impacts of various\nsystem parameters on the corresponding optimal policy and the resultant average\nAoI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jan 2020 12:41:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-09"}

The shortcoming\nis that a large amount of manually-annotated data is usually required. Previous\nstudies have demonstrated that active learning could elaborately reduce the\ncost of data annotation, but there is still plenty of room for improvement. In\nreal applications we found existing uncertainty-based active learning\nstrategies have two shortcomings. Firstly, these strategies prefer to choose\nlong sequence explicitly or implicitly, which increase the annotation burden of\nannotators. Secondly, some strategies need to invade the model and modify to\ngenerate some additional information for sample selection, which will increase\nthe workload of the developer and increase the training/prediction time of the\nmodel. In this paper, we first examine traditional active learning strategies\nin a specific case of BiLstm-CRF that has widely used in named entity\nrecognition on several typical datasets.

LTP is simple and\npowerful strategy that does not favor long sequences and does not need to\ninvade the model. We test LTP on multiple datasets, and the experiments show\nthat LTP performs slightly better than traditional strategies with obviously\nless annotation tokens on both sentence-level accuracy and entity-level\nF1-score.

We demonstrate here a method to increase the sensitivity of Ge\nsensors by implementing nanostructures to the wafer surfaces. The absorbance of\nnanostructured Ge wafers is measured to be >99 % in the whole UV-VIS-NIR\nspectrum up to 1600 nm wavelength, which is a significant improvement to bare\nGe wafers that reach absorption of only 63 % in maximum. The process is shown\nto be capable of producing uniform nanostructures covering full 100-mm-diameter\nsubstrates as well as wafers with etch mask openings of different sizes and\nshapes, which demonstrates its applicability to CMOS sensor manufacturing.

To explore this possibility, we formalize the dynamics\nof chemical reaction networks within the framework of chemical ecosystem\necology. To capture the idea that life-like chemical systems are maintained out\nof equilibrium by fluxes of energy-rich food chemicals, we model chemical\necosystems in well-mixed containers that are subject to constant dilution by a\nsolution with a fixed concentration of food chemicals. Modelling all chemical\nreactions as fully reversible, we show that seeding an autocatalytic cycle (AC)\nwith tiny amounts of one or more of its member chemicals results in logistic\ngrowth of all member chemicals in the cycle. This finding justifies drawing an\ninstructive analogy between an AC and the population of a biological species.\nWe extend this finding to show that pairs of ACs can show competitive,\npredator-prey, or mutualistic associations just like biological species.\nFurthermore, when there is stochasticity in the environment, particularly in\nthe seeding of ACs, chemical ecosystems can show complex dynamics that can\nresemble evolution. The evolutionary character is especially clear when the\nnetwork architecture results in ecological precedence (survival of the first),\nwhich makes the path of succession historically contingent on the order in\nwhich cycles are seeded. For all its simplicity, the framework developed here\nis helpful for visualizing how autocatalysis in prebiotic chemical reaction\nnetworks can yield life-like properties.

Yet, some of them may shine in gamma rays provided that the dark\nmatter (DM) is made of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), that would\nself-annihilate and would appear as unidentified gamma-ray sources (unIDs) in\ngamma-ray catalogs. Indeed, unIDs have proven to be competitive targets for DM\nsearches with gamma rays. In this work, we focus on the three high-latitude\n($|b|\\geq 10^\\circ$) sources present in the 2HWC catalog of the High Altitude\nWater Cherenkov (HAWC) observatory with no associations at other wavelenghts.\nIndeed, only one of these sources, 2HWC J1040+308, is found to be above the\nHAWC detection threshold when considering 760 days of data, a factor 1.5 more\nexposure time than in the original 2HWC catalog. Other instruments such as\nFermi-LAT or VERITAS at lower energies do not detect this source. Also, this\nunID is reported as spatially extended, making it even more interesting in a DM\nsearch context. While waiting for more data that may shed further light on the\nnature of this source, we set competitive upper limits on the annihilation\ncross section by comparing this HAWC unID to expectations based on\nstate-of-the-art N-body cosmological simulations of the Galactic subhalo\npopulation. We find these constraints to be particularly competitive for heavy\nWIMPs, i.e., masses above $\\sim 25$ (40) TeV in the case of the $b\\bar{b}$\n($\\tau^+\\tau^-$) annihilation channel, reaching velocity-averaged cross section\nvalues of $2\\cdot10^{-25}$ ($5\\cdot10^{-25}$) $cm^3s^{-1}$. Although far from\nthe thermal relic cross section value, the obtained limits are independent and\nnicely complementary to those from radically different DM analyses and targets,\ndemonstrating again the high potential of this DM search approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jan 2020 14:14:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-20"}

We find that there exist\ngenerally distinct cases of this theory, depending on (i) whether the\nHamiltonian constraint generates new (second-class) constraints (Cases A, C) or\njust fixes the associated Lagrange multipliers (Case B), or (ii) whether the IR\nLorentz-deformation parameter \\lambda is at the conformal point (Case C) or not\n(Cases A, B). It is found that, for Cases A and C, the dynamical degrees of\nfreedom are the same as in general relativity, while, for Case B, there is \"one\nadditional phase-space degree of freedom\", representing an extra (odd) scalar\ngraviton mode. This would resolve the long-standing debates about the extra\ngraviton modes and achieves the dynamical consistency of the Horava gravity, at\nthe \"fully non-linear\" level. Several exact solutions are also considered as\nsome explicit examples of the new constraints. The structure of the newly\nobtained, \"extended\" constraint algebra seems to be generic to Horava gravity\nand its general proof would be a challenging problem. Some other challenging\nproblems, which include the path integral quantization and the Dirac bracket\nquantization are discussed also.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jan 2020 14:51:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Jan 2020 17:36:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 2020 07:12:24 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2020 10:59:52 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 31 Jul 2020 05:28:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

The latter\ncan offload the traffic in their coverage areas from the BS. We consider the\njoint optimization of the abovementioned file placement and delivery within a\nfinite lifetime subject to the cache space constraint. Within the lifetime, the\nallocation of multicast power and symbol number for each file transmission at\nthe BS is formulated as a dynamic programming problem with a random stage\nnumber.

We investigated the\nmorphology, structure, and stellar content of the Blue Compact Galaxy Mrk 900,\ncombining optical integral field observations obtained with VIMOS at the VLT\nand deep broad-band photometry taken at the 2.5 m NOT telescope. From the\nintegral field data, we built continuum, emission, and diagnostic line ratio\nmaps and produced velocity and velocity dispersion maps. We also generated the\nintegrated spectrum of the major HII regions and the nuclear area to determine\nreliable physical parameters and oxygen abundances. The broad-band data,\ntracing the galaxy up to radius 4 kpc, allowed us to investigate the properties\nof the low surface brightness underlying stellar host. We disentangle two\ndifferent stellar components in Mrk 900: a young population, which resolves\ninto individual stellar clusters with ages ~5.5-6.6 Myr and extends about 1 kpc\nalong the galaxy minor axis, is placed on top of a rather red and regular\nshaped underlying stellar host, several Gyr old. We find evidence of a\nsubstantial amount of dust and an inhomogeneous extinction pattern, with a dust\nlane crossing the central starburst. Mrk 900 displays overall rotation,\nalthough distorted in the central, starburst regions; the dispersion velocity\nmap is highly inhomogeneous, with values increasing up to 60 kms$^{-1}$ at the\nperiphery of the SF regions, where we also find hints of the presence of\nshocks. Our observational results point to an interaction or merger with a\nlow-mass object or infalling gas as plausible trigger mechanisms for the\npresent starburst event.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jan 2020 15:32:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-19"}

This has been\npossible thanks to the data from new or upgraded radio telescopes. This review\nbriefly summarises the current status of the field and describes some of the\nexciting recent results and the surprises they have brought. In particular, the\nphysical properties of radio jets as function of their radio power will be\ndiscussed together with the advance made in understanding the life-cycle of\nradio sources. The evolutionary stage (e.g. newly born, dying, restarted) of\nthe radio AGN can be derived from their morphology and properties of the radio\nspectra. The possibilities offered by the new generation of low-frequency radio\ntelescopes make it possible to derive (at least to first order) the time-scale\nspent in each phase. The presence of a cycle of activity ensures a recurrent\nimpact of the radio jets on their surrounding inter-stellar and inter-galactic\nmedium and, therefore, their relevance for AGN feedback. The last part is\ndedicated to the recent results showing the effect of jets on the surrounding\ngalactic medium. The predictions made by numerical simulations on the impact of\na radio jet (and in particular a newly born jet) on a clumpy medium describe\nwell what is seen by the observations. The high resolution studies of\njet-driven outflows of cold gas (HI and molecular) has provided new important\naddition both in term of quantifying the impact of the outflows and their\nrelevance for feedback as well as for providing an unexpected view of the\nphysical conditions of the gas under these extreme conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jan 2020 07:32:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}

As logs are usually very large in size, automated log analysis is\nneeded to assist practitioners in their software operation and maintenance\nefforts. Typically, the first step of automated log analysis is log parsing,\ni.e., converting unstructured raw logs into structured data. However, log\nparsing is challenging, because logs are produced by static templates in the\nsource code (i.e., logging statements) yet the templates are usually\ninaccessible when parsing logs. Prior work proposed automated log parsing\napproaches that have achieved high accuracy. However, as the volume of logs\ngrows rapidly in the era of cloud computing, efficiency becomes a major concern\nin log parsing. In this work, we propose an automated log parsing approach,\nLogram, which leverages n-gram dictionaries to achieve efficient log parsing.\nWe evaluated Logram on 16 public log datasets and compared Logram with five\nstate-of-the-art log parsing approaches. We found that Logram achieves a\nsimilar parsing accuracy to the best existing approaches while outperforms\nthese approaches in efficiency (i.e., 1.8 to 5.1 times faster than the second\nfastest approaches). Furthermore, we deployed Logram on Spark and we found that\nLogram scales out efficiently with the number of Spark nodes (e.g., with\nnear-linear scalability) without sacrificing parsing accuracy. In addition, we\ndemonstrated that Logram can support effective online parsing of logs,\nachieving similar parsing results and efficiency with the offline mode.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 7 Jan 2020 16:42:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-10"}

Here, we present a mixed-precision tile algorithm to accelerate the\nCholesky factorization during the log-likelihood function evaluation. Under an\nappropriate ordering, it operates with double-precision arithmetic on tiles\naround the diagonal, while reducing to single-precision arithmetic for tiles\nsufficiently far off. This translates into an improvement of the performance\nwithout any deterioration of the numerical accuracy of the application. We rely\non the StarPU dynamic runtime system to schedule the tasks and to overlap them\nwith data movement. To assess the performance and the accuracy of the proposed\nmixed-precision algorithm, we use synthetic and real datasets on various shared\nand distributed-memory systems possibly equipped with hardware accelerators. We\ncompare our mixed-precision Cholesky factorization against the double-precision\nreference implementation as well as an independent block approximation method.\nWe obtain an average of 1.6X performance speedup on massively parallel\narchitectures while maintaining the accuracy necessary for modeling and\nprediction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 8 Jan 2020 08:00:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-12"}
