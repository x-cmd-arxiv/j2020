Our hypothesis is that we can influence an agent to learn faster by\napplying an external environmental pressure during training, which adversely\nimpacts its ability to get higher rewards. As such, we deviate from the\nclassical paradigm of sparse rewards and add a uniformly sampled reward value\nto the baseline reward to show that (1) sample efficiency of the training\nprocess can be correlated to the adversity experienced during training, (2) it\nis possible to achieve higher performance in less time and with less resources,\n(3) we can reduce the performance variability experienced seed over seed, (4)\nthere is a maximum point after which more pressure will not generate better\nresults, and (5) that random positive incentives have an adverse effect when\nusing a negative reward strategy, making an agent under those conditions learn\npoorly and more slowly.

In this paper, we propose NoDE (Noise for Data\nExfiltration), a new system for stealthy data exfiltration from enterprise\ndesktop computers. Specifically, NoDE achieves data exfiltration over a\nbuilding's power network by exploiting high-frequency voltage ripples (i.e.,\nswitching noises) generated by power factor correction circuits built into\ntoday's computers.

By partitioning all nodes into small committees and letting them work\nin parallel, we can significantly lower the amount of communication and\ncomputation, reduce the overhead on each node's storage, as well as enhance the\nthroughput of the distributed ledger. Existing sharding-based protocols still\nsuffer from several serious drawbacks. The first thing is that all non-faulty\nnodes must connect well with each other, which demands a huge number of\ncommunication channels in the network. Moreover, previous protocols have faced\ngreat loss in efficiency in the case where the honesty of each committee's\nleader is in question. At the same time, no explicit incentive is provided for\nnodes to actively participate in the protocol.\n  We present CycLedger, a scalable and secure parallel protocol for distributed\nledger via sharding. Our protocol selects a leader and a partial set for each\ncommittee, who are in charge of maintaining intra-shard consensus and\ncommunicating with other committees, to reduce the amortized complexity of\ncommunication, computation, and storage on all nodes. We introduce a novel\nsemi-commitment scheme between committees and a recovery procedure to prevent\nthe system from crashing even when leaders of committees are malicious. To add\nincentive for the network, we use the concept of reputation, which measures\neach node's trusty computing power. As nodes with a higher reputation receive\nmore rewards, there is an encouragement for nodes with strong computing ability\nto work honestly to gain reputation.

Each item, however, disappears after an a\npriori unknown amount of time that we term the horizon for that item. The\nseller knows the (possibly different) distribution of the horizon for each\nitem, but not its realization till the item actually disappears.

Here, for\nany number of items, we achieve a constant-competitive bound via a conceptually\nsimple policy that balances the rate at which buyers are accepted with the rate\nat which items are removed from the system.

Moreover, for a single item and MHR horizon distribution\nwith mean $\\mu$, we show a tight result: There is a fixed pricing scheme that\nhas competitive ratio at most $2 - 1/\\mu$, and this is the best achievable in\nthis class.\n  We further show that our results are best possible. First, we show that the\ncompetitive ratio is unbounded without the MHR assumption even for one item.\nFurther, even when the horizon distributions are i.i.d.

Getting the count of $k$-cliques for larger $k$ is algorithmically\nchallenging, due to the exponential blowup in the search space of large\ncliques. But a number of recent applications (especially for community\ndetection or clustering) use larger clique counts. Moreover, one often desires\n\\textit{local} counts, the number of $k$-cliques per vertex/edge.\n  Our main result is Pivoter, an algorithm that exactly counts the number of\n$k$-cliques, \\textit{for all values of $k$}. It is surprisingly effective in\npractice, and is able to get clique counts of graphs that were beyond the reach\nof previous work. For example, Pivoter gets all clique counts in a social\nnetwork with a 100M edges within two hours on a commodity machine. Previous\nparallel algorithms do not terminate in days. Pivoter can also feasibly get\nlocal per-vertex and per-edge $k$-clique counts (for all $k$) for many public\ndata sets with tens of millions of edges. To the best of our knowledge, this is\nthe first algorithm that achieves such results.\n  The main insight is the construction of a Succinct Clique Tree (SCT) that\nstores a compressed unique representation of all cliques in an input graph. It\nis built using a technique called \\textit{pivoting}, a classic approach by\nBron-Kerbosch to reduce the recursion tree of backtracking algorithms for\nmaximal cliques. Remarkably, the SCT can be built without actually enumerating\nall cliques, and provides a succinct data structure from which exact clique\nstatistics ($k$-clique counts, local counts) can be read off efficiently.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Jan 2020 06:50:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-22"}

By solving the\nBogoliubov-de Gennes equations, the Josephson currents contributed by the\ndiscrete Andreev levels and the continuous spectrum are obtained. For very\nshort junctions, because the direct tunneling of the Cooper pair dominates the\nJosephson current, the current-phase difference relation is independent of the\nmagnetization direction, which is the same as the conventional\nsuperconductor-ferromagnet-superconductor junctions. On the other hand, when\nthe length of the half-metal is similar to or greater than the superconducting\ncoherence length, the spin-triplet Josephson effect occurs and dominates the\nJosephson current. In this case, the current-phase difference relations show\nthe strong magnetoanisotropic behaviors with the period \\pi. When the\nmagnetization direction points to the $\\pm$ z directions, the current is zero\nregardless of the phase difference. However, the current has a large value when\nthe magnetization direction is parallel to the junction plane, which leads to a\nperfect switch effect of the Josephson current. Furthermore, we find that the\nlong junctions can host both the 0 state and \\pi state, and the $0$-$\\pi$\ntransitions can be achieved with the change of the magnetization direction. The\nphysical origins of the switch effect and $0$-$\\pi$ transitions are interpreted\nfrom the perspectives of the spin-triplet Andreev reflection, the Ising pairing\norder parameter and the Ginzburg-Landau type of free energy. In addition, the\ninfluences of the chemical potential, the magnetization magnitude, and the\nstrength of the Ising spin-orbit coupling on the switch effect and $0$-$\\pi$\ntransitions are also investigated. Furthermore, the two-dimensional Josephson\njunctions are also investigated and we show that the spin-triplet Josephson\neffect can exist always.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Jan 2020 11:25:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-22"}

The curve estimation is specially designed,\nconsidering pixel value range, monotonicity, and differentiability.

The main\nresult of the paper is that inflation and the dark energy era may be realized\nin a geometric way by an $F(R)$ gravity, while the axion is the dark matter\nconstituent of the Universe. The $F(R)$ gravity model consists of an $R^2$\nterm, which as we show dominates the evolution during the early time, thus\nproducing a viable inflationary phenomenology, and a power law term $\\sim\nR^{\\delta}$ with $\\delta\\ll 1 $ and positive, which eventually controls the\nlate-time era. The axion field remains frozen during the inflationary era,\nwhich is an effect known for misalignment axions, but as the Universe expands,\nthe axion starts to oscillate, and its energy density scales eventually as we\nshow, as $\\rho_a\\sim a^{-3}$.

We demonstrate that sodium density\nprofiles can be retrieved by amplitude modulation of continuous wave (CW)\nlasers. In an experiment conducted at the Large Zenith Telescope (LZT), ESO's\nWendelstein Raman-fibre laser was amplitude-modulated with a pseudo-random\nbinary sequence and profiles were obtained by cross-correlation of the\nmodulation pattern with the observed return signal from the laser guide star.\nFor comparison, high-resolution profiles were obtained simultaneously using the\nlidar system of the LZT. The profiles obtained by the two techniques show noise\ncontamination, but were found to agree to within the measurement error. As a\nfurther check, a comparison was also made between several lidar profiles and\nthose obtained by simultaneous observations using a remote telescope to image\nthe laser plume from the side. The modulated CW lidar technique could be\nimplemented by diverting a small fraction of the returned laser light to a\nphoton counting detector. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations\nindicate that, for 50 per cent modulation strength, the sodium centroid\naltitude could be retrieved every 5 s from a single laser guide star, with an\naccuracy which would induce a corresponding wavefront error of 50 nm for the\nELT and less than 30 nm for the TMT and GMT. If multiple laser guide stars are\nemployed, the required modulation amplitude will be smaller.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Jan 2020 15:12:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-01"}

Under the assumption of the system\noperating with infinite blocklength (IBL) codes, the IBL throughputs of both\nthe GU and the UAV are derived under the two schemes.

As a result, they usually start off as favourites but\nquickly become the outcasts of the digital asset market.\n  The blockchain society attempts to anchor the value of cryptocurrency with\nreal values by employing smart contracts and link it with computation resources\nand the digital-productivity that have value and demands in the real world. But\ntheir attempts have some undesirable effects due to a limited number of\npractical applications. This limitation is caused by the dilemma between high\nperformance and decentralisation (universal joinability). The emerging of\nblockchain sharding models, however, has offered a possible solution to address\nthis dilemma.\n  In this paper, we explore a financial model for blockchain sharding that will\nbuild an active link between the value of cryptocurrency and computation\nresources as well as the market and labour behaviours. Our model can adjust the\nprice of resources and the compensation for maintaining a system based on those\nbehaviours. We anchor the value of cryptocurrency by the amount of computation\nresources participated in and give the cryptocurrency a meaning as the exchange\nbetween computation resources globally. Finally, we present a working example\nwhich, through financial regularities, regulates the behaviour of anonymous\nparticipants, also incents/discourages participation dynamically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 19 Jan 2020 05:22:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 23 Mar 2020 13:53:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-24"}

Previous\nweakly supervised studies typically assume that there is only one kind of weak\nsupervision in data. In many applications, however, raw data usually contains\nmore than one kind of weak supervision at the same time. For example, in user\nexperience enhancement from Didi, one of the largest online ride-sharing\nplatforms, the ride comment data contains severe label noise (due to the\nsubjective factors of passengers) and severe label distribution bias (due to\nthe sampling bias). We call such a problem as \"compound weakly supervised\nlearning\". In this paper, we propose the CWSL method to address this problem\nbased on Didi ride-sharing comment data. Specifically, an instance reweighting\nstrategy is employed to cope with severe label noise in comment data, where the\nweights for harmful noisy instances are small. Robust criteria like AUC rather\nthan accuracy and the validation performance are optimized for the correction\nof biased data label. Alternating optimization and stochastic gradient methods\naccelerate the optimization on large-scale data. Experiments on Didi\nride-sharing comment data clearly validate the effectiveness.
