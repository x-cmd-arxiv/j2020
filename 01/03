However, this success relies on\nthe interactive hand-tuning of a reward function by RL experts. On the other\nhand, inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) seeks to learn a reward function\nfrom readily-obtained human demonstrations. Yet, IRL suffers from two major\nlimitations: 1) reward ambiguity - there are an infinite number of possible\nreward functions that could explain an expert's demonstration and 2)\nheterogeneity - human experts adopt varying strategies and preferences, which\nmakes learning from multiple demonstrators difficult due to the common\nassumption that demonstrators seeks to maximize the same reward. In this work,\nwe propose a method to jointly infer a task goal and humans' strategic\npreferences via network distillation. This approach enables us to distill a\nrobust task reward (addressing reward ambiguity) and to model each strategy's\nobjective (handling heterogeneity). We demonstrate our algorithm can better\nrecover task reward and strategy rewards and imitate the strategies in two\nsimulated tasks and a real-world table tennis task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jan 2020 16:04:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Jan 2020 18:45:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2020 16:04:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-24"}

This first part is on local existence and well-posedness. A\nsecond part in preparation is on blow-up criteria and regularization.

However, reported adhesion, invagination and embedment of\nnanoparticles (NPs) do not compromise the membrane integrity, precluding direct\nbilayer damage as a mechanism for toxicity. Here it is shown that a lipid\nmembrane can be torn by small enough nanoparticles, thus unveiling mechanisms\nfor how lipid membrane can be compromised by tearing from nanoparticles.\nSurprisingly, visualization by cryo transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM)\nof liposomes exposed to nanoparticles revealed also that liposomal laceration\nis prevented by particle abundance.

Resource sharing among different edge cloud-service\nproviders can address the aforementioned limitation as certain service\nproviders may have resources available that can be ``rented'' by other service\nproviders. However, edge cloud service providers can have different objectives\nor \\emph{utilities}. Therefore, there is a need for an efficient and effective\nmechanism to share resources among service providers, while considering the\ndifferent objectives of various providers.

In this paper, we consider the identifiability\nproblem of sparse-MBD and show that, similar to compressive sensing, it is\npossible to identify the sparse filters from compressive measurements of the\noutput sequences.

The water diffusion causes wrinkle formation\nin GNR, which influences its properties. Furthermore, the diffused water\neventually dries, creating the alteration not only in the geometry of Wrinkled\nGraphene Nanoribbons (WGNR) but also its features. Computational analysis of\nthese phenomena can provide an atomistic-level understanding of the phenomena.\nTherefore, in this work, Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are performed to\nmodel the water diffusion and evaporation in between GNR and its substrate, and\ntheir effect on wrinkle formation and dynamics.

The goal of this chapter is to pave the way for\nappreciating the challenges and advancements via: (1) introducing the types of\ninformation disorder on social media and examine their differences and\nconnections; (2) describing important and emerging tasks to combat\ndisinformation for characterization, detection and attribution; and (3)\ndiscussing a weak supervision approach to detect disinformation with limited\nlabeled data. We then provide an overview of the chapters in this book that\nrepresent the recent advancements in three related parts: (1) user engagements\nin the dissemination of information disorder; (2) techniques on detecting and\nmitigating disinformation; and (3) trending issues such as ethics, blockchain,\nclickbaits, etc. We hope this book to be a convenient entry point for\nresearchers, practitioners, and students to understand the problems and\nchallenges, learn state-of-the-art solutions for their specific needs, and\nquickly identify new research problems in their domains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jan 2020 21:01:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-06"}

This evolution of bone\ndensity is one of the most important mechanisms for developing fracture\nresistance. A finite element framework for simulating bone adaptation, commonly\ncalled bone remodelling, is presented. This is followed by a novel method to\nboth quantify fracture resistance and to simulate fracture propagation. The\nauthors' previous work on the application of configurational mechanics for\nmodelling fracture is extended to include the influence of heterogeneous bone\ndensity distribution. The main advantage of this approach is that\nconfigurational forces, and fracture energy release rate, are expressed\nexclusively in terms of nodal quantities. This approach avoids the need for\npost-processing and enables a fully implicit formulation for modelling the\nevolving crack front. In this paper density fields are generated from both (a)\nbone adaptation analysis and (b) subject-specific geometry and material\nproperties obtained from CT scans. It is shown that, in order to correctly\nevaluate the configurational forces at the crack front, it is necessary to have\na spatially smooth density field with higher regularity than if the field is\ndirectly approximated on the finite element mesh. Therefore, discrete density\ndata is approximated as a smooth density field using a Moving Weighted Least\nSquares method. Performance of the framework is demonstrated using numerical\nsimulations for bone adaptation and subsequent crack propagation, including\nconsideration of an equine 3rd metacarpal bone.

The energetic and the spectral\nproperties of the first episode are in stark contrast to the second. The first\nepisode, which has a higher spectral peak of $\\sim 120\\:\\text{keV}$ and a low\nisotropic energy $\\sim 10^{50}\\:\\text{erg}$ is an outlier to the Amati\ncorrelation and marginally satisfies the Yonetoku correlation.

Prompt emission of LLGRBs also indicates a relativistic shock\nbreakout origin of the radiation. For GRB 190829A, some of the properties of a\nshock breakout origin are satisfied.

In the first\nstage, linear least squares is used to obtain a subset of the unknown\nparameters (set 1), while a residual sampling procedure is used for selecting\ninitial values for the rest of the parameters (set 2). In the second stage,\ndepending on the uniqueness of the local minimum, either only the parameters in\nthe second set need to be re-estimated, or all the parameters will have to be\nre-estimated simultaneously, by a nonlinear constrained optimization. The\nestimates from the first stage are used as initial conditions for the second\nstage optimizer. It is shown that this approach alleviates the sensitivity to\ninitial conditions and minimizes the likelihood of converging to an incorrect\nlocal minimum of the nonlinear cost function. An error bound analysis is\npresented to show that the first stage can be solved in such a way that the\ntotal cost function will be driven to the optimal cost, and the difference has\nan upper bound. Two tutorial examples are used to show how to implement this\nestimator and compare its performance to other similar nonlinear estimators.\nFinally, the estimator is used on a 5-hole Pitot tube calibration problem using\nflight test data collected from a small Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) which\ncannot be easily solved with single-stage methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jan 2020 00:02:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-18"}

Therefore, there is a great need for computational methods that\ncan explain, audit, and debug such models. Here, we use flip points to\naccomplish these goals for deep learning models with continuous output scores\n(e.g., computed by softmax), used in social applications. A flip point is any\npoint that lies on the boundary between two output classes: e.g. for a model\nwith a binary yes/no output, a flip point is any input that generates equal\nscores for \"yes\" and \"no\". The flip point closest to a given input is of\nparticular importance because it reveals the least changes in the input that\nwould change a model's classification, and we show that it is the solution to a\nwell-posed optimization problem. Flip points also enable us to systematically\nstudy the decision boundaries of a deep learning classifier.

However, although existing\nimage fusion techniques, including traditional algorithms and deep\nlearning-based algorithms, can generate high-quality fused images, they need\nmultiple images with different focus depths in the same field of view. This\ncriterion may not be met in some cases where time efficiency is required or the\nhardware is insufficient. The problem is especially prominent in large-size\nwhole slide images. This paper focused on the multi-focus image fusion of\ncytopathological digital slide images, and proposed a novel method for\ngenerating fused images from single-focus or few-focus images based on\nconditional generative adversarial network (GAN). Through the adversarial\nlearning of the generator and discriminator, the method is capable of\ngenerating fused images with clear textures and large depth of field. Combined\nwith the characteristics of cytopathological images, this paper designs a new\ngenerator architecture combining U-Net and DenseBlock, which can effectively\nimprove the network's receptive field and comprehensively encode image\nfeatures. Meanwhile, this paper develops a semantic segmentation network that\nidentifies the blurred regions in cytopathological images. By integrating the\nnetwork into the generative model, the quality of the generated fused images is\neffectively improved. Our method can generate fused images from only\nsingle-focus or few-focus images, thereby avoiding the problem of collecting\nmultiple images of different focus depths with increased time and hardware\ncosts. Furthermore, our model is designed to learn the direct mapping of input\nsource images to fused images without the need to manually design complex\nactivity level measurements and fusion rules as in traditional methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jan 2020 02:13:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-06"}

In this paper, we design a\ndifferentially private combinatorial cloud auction mechanism (DPCA) to address\nthis privacy issue. Technically, we employ the exponential mechanism to compute\na clearing unit price vector with a probability proportional to the\ncorresponding revenue. We further improve the mechanism to reduce the running\ntime while maintaining high revenues, by computing a single clearing unit\nprice, or a subgroup of clearing unit prices at a time, resulting in the\nimproved mechanisms DPCA-S and its generalized version DPCA-M, respectively. We\ntheoretically prove that our mechanisms can guarantee differential privacy,\napproximate truthfulness and high revenue.

In a\nmore general approach, it has been shown that fewer body correlations can\nreveal the non-local nature of the correlations arising from a quantum\nmechanical description of nature. Such tests on the correlations can be\ntransformed to a semi-definite program (SDP). This study reports the\nexperimental implementation of a local measurement-based hierarchy on the\nnuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) hardware utilizing three nuclear spins as\nqubits. The protocol has been experimentally tested on genuinely entangled\ntripartite states such as W state, GHZ state and a few graph states. In all the\ncases, the experimentally measured correlations were used to formulate the SDP,\nusing linear constraints on the entries of the moment matrix. We observed that\nfor each genuinely entangled state, the SDP failed to find a semi-definite\npositive moment matrix consistent with the experimental data.

Existing works exploited this observation by learning to skip\nconvolutional layers in an input-dependent manner. However, we argue their\nbinary decision scheme, i.e., either fully executing or completely bypassing\none layer for a specific input, can be enhanced by introducing finer-grained,\n\"softer\" decisions. We therefore propose a Dynamic Fractional Skipping (DFS)\nframework. The core idea of DFS is to hypothesize layer-wise quantization (to\ndifferent bitwidths) as intermediate \"soft\" choices to be made between fully\nutilizing and skipping a layer. For each input, DFS dynamically assigns a\nbitwidth to both weights and activations of each layer, where fully executing\nand skipping could be viewed as two \"extremes\" (i.e., full bitwidth and zero\nbitwidth). In this way, DFS can \"fractionally\" exploit a layer's expressive\npower during input-adaptive inference, enabling finer-grained\naccuracy-computational cost trade-offs. It presents a unified view to link\ninput-adaptive layer skipping and input-adaptive hybrid quantization. Extensive\nexperimental results demonstrate the superior tradeoff between computational\ncost and model expressive power (accuracy) achieved by DFS. More visualizations\nalso indicate a smooth and consistent transition in the DFS behaviors,\nespecially the learned choices between layer skipping and different\nquantizations when the total computational budgets vary, validating our\nhypothesis that layer quantization could be viewed as intermediate variants of\nlayer skipping.

Previous studies considered the\nDoppler effect on the phase of GWs as a potential signature of a time-dependent\nvelocity of the source. However, the Doppler shift only accounts for the time\ncomponent of the wave vector, and in principle motion also affects the spatial\ncomponents. The latter effect, known as ``aberration'' for light, is analyzed\nin this paper for GWs and applied to the waveform modeling of an accelerating\nsource. We show that the additional aberrational phase shift could be\ndetectable in two astrophysical scenarios, namely, a recoiling binary black\nhole (BBH) due to GW radiation and a BBH in a triple system. Our results\nsuggest that adding the aberrational phase shift in the waveform templates\ncould significantly enhance the detectability of moving sources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jan 2020 04:59:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Apr 2020 01:52:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-28"}

Methods: For the\nspectral analysis we use both phenomenological and physics-based models. We\nemploy an often used empirical model to identify the main characteristics of\nthe spectral shape in relation to nominal spectral characteristics of X-ray\npulsars. Additionally, we used the latest version of Bulk \\& Thermal\ncomptonization model (BW), to assess the validity of the spectral components\nrequired by the empirical model and to investigate the origin of the hard X-ray\nemission. We also analyzed the source light-curve, studying the pulse shape at\ndifferent energy ranges and tracking the spectral evolution with pulse phase by\nusing the model independent hardness ratio (HR). Results: We find that while\nboth the empirical and physical (BW) spectral models can produce good spectral\nfits, the BW model returns physically plausible best-fit values for the source\nparameters and does not require any additional spectral components to the\nnon-thermal, accretion column emission. The BW model also yielded an estimation\nof the neutron star magnetic field placing it in the 10^12G range. Conclusions:\nOur results, show that the spectral and temporal characteristics of the source\nemission are consistent with the scattering processes expected for radiation\ndominated shocks within the accretion column of highly magnetized accreting\nneutron stars.

By separating the\ncontributions of vacuum fluctuations and atomic radiation reaction, we first\nshow that for the two-atom system initially prepared in the factorizable\neigenstates $|g_Ag_B\\rangle$ and $|e_Ae_B\\rangle$, where $g$ and $e$ represent\nthe ground state and the excited state of a single atom respectively, both\nvacuum fluctuations and atomic radiation reaction contribute to the average\nrate of change of energy of the two-atom system, and the contribution of vacuum\nfluctuations is independent of the interatomic separation while that of atomic\nradiation reaction is dependent on it. This is contrary to the existing results\nin the literature where vacuum fluctuations are interatomic-separation\ndependent. However, if the two-atom system is initially prepared in the\nunfactorizable symmetric/antisymmetric entangled state, the average rate of\nchange of energy of the two-atom system is never perturbed by the vacuum\nfluctuations, but is totally a result of the atomic radiation reaction. We then\nconsider two special cases of motion of the two-atom system which is initially\nprepared in the symmetric/antisymmetric entangled state, i.e., synchronized\ninertial motion and synchronized uniform acceleration. In contrast to the\naverage rate of change of energy of a single uniformly accelerated atom, the\naverage rate of change of energy of the uniformly accelerated two-atom system\nis nonthermal-like.

Though\ndramatic progress has been achieved in convex problems, the results for\nnon-convex cases, especially with non-linear constraints, are still largely\nunexplored. This is mainly due to the challenges imposed by the non-linearity\nand non-convexity, which makes establishing the convergence conditions\nbewildered. This paper investigates decentralized optimization for a class of\nstructured non-convex problems characterized by: (i) nonconvex global objective\nfunction (possibly nonsmooth) and (ii) coupled nonlinear constraints and local\nbounded convex constraints w.r.t. the agents. For such problems, a\ndecentralized approach called Proximal Linearizationbased Decentralized Method\n(PLDM) is proposed. Different from the traditional (augmented) Lagrangian-based\nmethods which usually require the exact (local) optima at each iteration, the\nproposed method leverages a proximal linearization-based technique to update\nthe decision variables iteratively, which makes it computationally efficient\nand viable for the non-linear cases. Under some standard conditions, the PLDM\nglobal convergence and local convergence rate to the epsilon-critical points\nare studied based on the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz property which holds for most\nanalytical functions. Finally, the performance and efficacy of the method are\nillustrated through a numerical example and an application to multi-zone\nheating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) control.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jan 2020 09:29:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 27 Aug 2022 13:10:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-30"}

The proposed schemes are shown to share the\norder of explicit Runge-Kutta method and thus can reach the desired high-order\naccuracy. Moreover, the methods are energy-preserving and explicit because the\nprojection step can be solved explicitly. Numerical results are addressed to\ndemonstrate the remarkable superiority of the proposed schemes in comparison\nwith other structure-preserving methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jan 2020 10:17:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 30 May 2020 11:16:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-02"}

If the\nobjective and constraint functions of a variable optimization problem can be\nderived, standard numerical algorithms can be applied for finding the optimal\nsolution, which however incur high computational cost when the dimension of the\nvariable is high. To reduce the on-line computational complexity, learning the\noptimal solution as a function of the environment's status by deep neural\nnetworks (DNNs) is an effective approach. DNNs can be trained under the\nsupervision of optimal solutions, which however, is not applicable to the\nscenarios without models or for functional optimization where the optimal\nsolutions are hard to obtain.

Modern email clients take a step forward and help improve users'\nproductivity by automatically creating reminders, tasks or responses. The act\nof reading is arguably the only activity that is in common in most -- if not\nall -- of the interactions that users have with their emails.\n  In this paper, we characterize how users read their enterprise emails, and\nreveal the various contextual factors that impact reading time. Our approach\nstarts with a reading time analysis based on the reading events from a major\nemail platform, followed by a user study to provide explanations for some\ndiscoveries. We identify multiple temporal and user contextual factors that are\ncorrelated with reading time. For instance, email reading time is correlated\nwith user devices: on desktop reading time increases through the morning and\npeaks at noon but on mobile it increases through the evening till midnight. The\nreading time is also negatively correlated with the screen size.\n  We have established the connection between user status and reading time:\nusers spend more time reading emails when they have fewer meetings and busy\nhours during the day. In addition, we find that users also reread emails across\ndevices. Among the cross-device reading events, 76% of reread emails are first\nvisited on mobile and then on desktop. Overall, our study is the first to\ncharacterize enterprise email reading time on a very large scale.

We\nthen perform symbolic execution of that path to extract a model expressed in a\nprocess calculus similar to the one used by the CryptoVerif tool. The symbolic\nexecution uses a novel algorithm that allows symbolic variables to represent\nbitstrings of potentially unknown length to model incoming protocol messages.\n  The extracted models do not use pointer-addressed memory, but they may still\ncontain low-level details concerning message formats. In the next step we\nreplace the message formatting expressions by abstract tupling and projection\noperators. The properties of these operators, such as the projection operation\nbeing the inverse of the tupling operation, are typically only satisfied with\nrespect to inputs of correct types. Therefore we typecheck the model to ensure\nthat all type-safety constraints are satisfied.

In this work, we present and appraise a new simple\nand flexible methodology for hydrological time series forecasting. This\nmethodology relies on (a) at least two individual forecasting methods and (b)\nthe median combiner of forecasts. The appraisal is made by using a big dataset\nconsisted of 90-year-long mean annual river flow time series from approximately\n600 stations. Covering large parts of North America and Europe, these stations\nrepresent various climate and catchment characteristics, and thus can\ncollectively support benchmarking. Five individual forecasting methods and 26\nvariants of the introduced methodology are applied to each time series. The\napplication is made in one-step ahead forecasting mode. The individual methods\nare the last-observation benchmark, simple exponential smoothing, complex\nexponential smoothing, automatic autoregressive fractionally integrated moving\naverage (ARFIMA) and Facebook's Prophet, while the 26 variants are defined by\nall the possible combinations (per two, three, four or five) of the five\nafore-mentioned methods. The new methodology is identified as well-performing\nin the long run, especially when more than two individual forecasting methods\nare combined within its framework. Moreover, the possibility of case-informed\nintegrations of diverse hydrological forecasting methods within systematic\nframeworks is algorithmically investigated and discussed. The related\ninvestigations encompass linear regression analyses, which aim at finding\ninterpretable relationships between the values of a representative forecasting\nperformance metric and the values of selected river flow statistics...\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jan 2020 18:45:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Aug 2020 16:58:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-19"}

The identifier measurement\nchannels during authentication are assumed to be controllable via a\ncost-constrained action sequence. Single-letter inner and outer bounds for the\nkey-leakage-storage-cost regions are derived for a generalization of a classic\ntwo-terminal key agreement model with an eavesdropper that observes a sequence\nthat is correlated with the sequences observed by the legitimate terminals. The\nadditions to the model are that the encoder observes a noisy version of a\nremote source, and the noisy output and the remote source output together with\nan action sequence are given as inputs to the measurement channel at the\ndecoder. Thus, correlation is introduced between the noise components on the\nencoder and decoder measurements. The model with a secret key generated by an\nencoder is extended to the randomized models, where a secret-key is embedded to\nthe encoder. The results are relevant for several user and device\nauthentication scenarios including physical and biometric identifiers with\nmultiple measurements that provide diversity and multiplexing gains. To\nillustrate the behavior of the rate region, achievable (secret-key rate,\nstorage-rate, cost) tuples are given for binary identifiers and measurement\nchannels that can be represented as a mixture of binary symmetric subchannels.\nThe gains from using an action sequence such as a large secret-key rate at a\nsignificantly small hardware cost, are illustrated to motivate the use of\nlow-complexity transform-coding algorithms with cost-constrained actions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jan 2020 14:29:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 22 Feb 2020 13:49:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 18 May 2020 08:38:18 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 23 Jul 2020 10:17:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-24"}

In TOP,\neach location can be visited by at most one vehicle, and the goal is to\nmaximize the total sum of rewards collected by the vehicles within a given time\nlimit. In this paper, we propose a generalization of TOP, namely the Steiner\nTeam Orienteering Problem (STOP). In STOP, we provide, additionally, a subset\nof mandatory locations. In this sense, STOP also aims at maximizing the total\nsum of rewards collected within the time limit, but, now, every mandatory\nlocation must be visited. In this work, we propose a new commodity-based\nformulation for STOP and use it within a cutting-plane scheme. The algorithm\nbenefits from the compactness and strength of the proposed formulation and\nworks by separating three families of valid inequalities, which consist of some\ngeneral connectivity constraints, classical lifted cover inequalities based on\ndual bounds and a class of conflict cuts. To our knowledge, the last class of\ninequalities is also introduced in this work. A state-of-the-art branch-and-cut\nalgorithm from the literature of TOP is adapted to STOP and used as baseline to\nevaluate the performance of the cutting-plane. Extensive computational\nexperiments show the competitiveness of the new algorithm while solving several\nSTOP and TOP instances. In particular, it is able to solve, in total, 14 more\nTOP instances than any other previous exact algorithm and finds eight new\noptimality certificates. With respect to the new STOP instances introduced in\nthis work, our algorithm solves 30 more instances than the baseline.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jan 2020 15:04:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-06"}

Ten years ago, a\nmethod known as Monolayer Stress Microscopy (MSM) was suggested from which the\nintercellular stresses could be computed given a traction field. The core\nassumption of MSM is that the intercellular stresses within the monolayer\nbehave similarly to passive systems like a Hookean solid (an elastic sheet) or\na Newtonian fluid (thin fluid film), implying a relation between the\ndisplacements/velocities and tractions. Due to the lack of independently\nmeasured intercellular stresses, validation of MSM is difficult. An alternative\napproach, which we give here, is based on simultaneous measurements of the\nmonolayer velocity field and the cell/substrate tractions. With limited\nassumptions, the velocity field suffices to compute tractions, which we can\nthen compare directly with those measured by traction force microscopy. We find\nthat the calculated tractions and measured tractions are uncorrelated. Since\nboth classical MSM and a purely viscous description of the relation between\ndisplacements or velocities and tractions depends on a linear constitutive law,\nit follows that some modification of these approaches is needed. One possible\nresolution is the inclusion of an active force. To this end, we give a new\nrelationship between the active force density and the measured velocity(or\ndisplacement) field, and tractions, which by Newton's laws, must be obeyed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jan 2020 20:22:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-04"}

In rare\ngases, it is appropriate to model both friction and agitation in terms of\nindependent molecular impacts with the particle. But in relatively dense\nfluids, such as water and air at standard temperature and pressure, the mean\nfree path between collisions of fluid molecules is much smaller than the size\nof the Brownian particle, and the friction is normally treated as a mesoscopic\nviscous effect described by Stokes' Law which treats the fluid as continuous.\nThe appropriateness of using Stokes' Law will be discussed in terms of recent\nexperimental research in the ballistic or \"coasting\" phase of motion occurring\nat a very short time scale. Given the mesoscopic nature of the friction force\nfor relatively dense fluids, we should expect the agitation force to also be\nmesoscopic. But it is often unrealistically modeled as uncorrelated individual\nimpacts. It has been suggested occasionally that mesoscopic pressure\nfluctuations are appropriate for denser fluids. The purpose of this paper is to\nmodel friction as a result of mesoscopic pressure fluctuations. First, the\nsimple random walk will be used to approximate the time and space scales below\nwhich ballistic motion begins and diffusive motion ends. Following that,\npressure fluctuations and the associated time scale will be introduced to\nexplain Brownian motion. As successful as the pressure fluctuation model is for\nmany fluids, it will be shown to fail for fluids like glycerin that have\nviscosities a thousand times and more that of water.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jan 2020 19:26:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Jun 2020 18:33:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-15"}

Herein, the performance of a fabricated\nAu/NTCDA/p-Si/Al photodiode was explained in details and showed an excellent\nresponsivity, and detectivity for UV light of intensities ranges from 20 to 80\n${mW/cm^2}$. The fabricated photodiodes exhibited a linear current-irradiance\nrelationship under illumination up to 65 ${mW/cm^2}$. It also exhibits good\nresponse times of ${t_{rise} = 408}$ ms and ${t_{fall} = 490}$ ms. Furthermore,\nwe have not only fitted the characteristic I-V curve but also evaluated three\nclassical algorithms; k-nearest neighbour, artificial neural network, and\ngenetic programming besides using a quantum neural network to predict the\nbehaviour of the fabricated device. The models have achieved outstanding\nresults and managed to capture the trend of the target values. The Quantum\nNeural Network has been used for the first time to model the photodiode. The\nmodels can be used instead of repeating the fabrication process. This means a\nreduction in cost and manufacturing time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 2 Jan 2020 17:40:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Jun 2020 16:02:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 3 Aug 2020 17:09:26 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 12 Apr 2021 01:44:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-01"}
