(c) feeding: combining mixed samples with new ones\nfrom dataset into batch (with ratio $\\gamma$). Note that sample that appears in\nour batch propagates with subsequent iterations with less and less importance\nuntil the end of training. Pairing stage calculates the error per sample, sorts\nthe samples and pairs with strategy: hardest with easiest one, than mixing\nstage merges two samples using mixup, $x_1 + (1-\\lambda)x_2$.

The magnetic polarizability tensor (MPT)\nprovides a characterisation of a conducting permeable object using a small\nnumber of coefficients, has explicit formula for their calculation and a well\nunderstood frequency behaviour, which we call its spectral signature. However,\nto compute such signatures, and build a library of them for object\nclassification, requires repeated solution of a direct (full order) problem,\nwhich is typically accomplished using a finite element discretisation.

A small sample of\ngravitationally lensed quasar systems was chosen where the quasar images appear\nto lie on the fringe of the stellar distribution of the lensing galaxy. As with\nmost quasar systems, all the individual quasar images were observed to be\nmicrolensed. The surface brightness of the lensing galaxy at the positions of\nthe quasar images was measured from HST frames, and converted to stellar\nsurface mass density. The surface density of smoothly distributed dark matter\nat the image positions was obtained from lensing models of the quasar systems\nand applied to the stellar surface mass density to give the optical depth to\nmicrolensing. This was then used to assess the probability that the stars in\nthe lensing galaxy could be responsible for the observed microlensing. The\nresults were supported by microlensing simulations of the star fields around\nthe quasar images combined with values of convergence and shear from the\nlensing models. Taken together, the probability that all the observed\nmicrolensing is due to stars was found to be ~0.0003. Errors resulting from\nsurface brightness measurement, mass-to-light ratio and the contribution of the\ndark matter halo do not significantly affect this result. It is argued that the\nmost plausible candidates for the microlenses are primordial black holes,\neither in the dark matter halos of the lensing galaxies, or more generally\ndistributed along the lines of sight to the quasars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jan 2020 16:26:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-22"}

More\nrecently, there has been a shift to utilizing deep learning and fully\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs) to perform image segmentation that has\nyielded state-of-the-art results in many public benchmark datasets. Despite the\nprogress of deep learning in medical image segmentation, standard CNNs are\nstill not fully adopted in clinical settings as they lack robustness and\ninterpretability. Shapes are generally more meaningful features than solely\ntextures of images, which are features regular CNNs learn, causing a lack of\nrobustness. Likewise, previous works surrounding model interpretability have\nbeen focused on post hoc gradient-based saliency methods. However,\ngradient-based saliency methods typically require additional computations post\nhoc and have been shown to be unreliable for interpretability. Thus, we present\na new architecture called Shape Attentive U-Net (SAUNet) which focuses on model\ninterpretability and robustness. The proposed architecture attempts to address\nthese limitations by the use of a secondary shape stream that captures rich\nshape-dependent information in parallel with the regular texture stream.\nFurthermore, we suggest multi-resolution saliency maps can be learned using our\ndual-attention decoder module which allows for multi-level interpretability and\nmitigates the need for additional computations post hoc.

Understanding the behavior of AAT is increasingly important given the\never growing demand for air travel and flight delays becoming more rampant. As\nno research on AAT exists, this paper performs the first empirical analysis of\nAAT behavior, comparatively for the U.S. and China. The focus is on how AAT is\naffected by scheduled block time (SBT), origin-destination (OD) distance, and\nthe possible pressure to reduce AAT from other parts of flight operations.\nMultiple econometric models are developed. The estimation results show that in\nboth countries AAT is highly correlated with SBT and OD distance. Flights in\nthe U.S. are faster than in China. On the other hand, facing ground delay prior\nto takeoff, a flight has limited capability to speed up. The pressure from\nshort turnaround time after landing to reduce AAT is immaterial. Sensitivity\nanalysis of AAT to flight length and aircraft utilization is further conducted.\nGiven the more abundant airspace, flexible routing networks, and efficient ATFM\nprocedures, a counterfactual that the AAT behavior in the U.S. were adopted in\nChina is examined. We find that by doing so significant efficiency gains could\nbe achieved in the Chinese air traffic system. On average, 11.8 minutes of AAT\nper flight would be saved, coming from both reduction in SBT and reduction in\nAAT relative to the new SBT. Systemwide fuel saving would amount to over 300\nmillion gallons with direct airline operating cost saving of nearly $1.3\nbillion nationwide in 2016.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jan 2020 16:50:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-22"}

Despite its\nimportant role in maintaining a proper energy balance between the resolved and\nSGS scales, modeling of the energy dissipation rate has received scarce\nattention. In this paper, a SGS model belonging to the dynamic structure family\nis developed based on findings from direct numerical simulation (DNS) studies\nof decaying isotropic turbulence.

The SkyMapper filter-set contains a\nmetallicity-sensitive intermediate-band $v$ filter covering the prominent Ca II\nK feature at 3933.7A. When combined with photometry from the SkyMapper $u, g$,\nand $i$ filters, we demonstrate that $v$ band photometry can be used to obtain\nstellar metallicities with a precision of $\\sim0.20$dex when [Fe/H] $> -2.5$,\nand $\\sim0.34$dex when [Fe/H] $< -2.5$. Since the $u$ and $v$ filters bracket\nthe Balmer Jump at 3646A, we also find that the filter-set can be used to\nderive surface gravities. We thus derive photometric metallicities and surface\ngravities for all stars down to a magnitude of $g\\sim20$ within $\\sim$75\narcminutes of Tucana II.

We use the spectra of more than 30,000 red giant branch (RGB) stars in\n25 globular clusters (GC), obtained within the MUSE survey of Galactic globular\nclusters, to calibrate the Ca II triplet (CaT) metallicity relation and derive\nmetallicities for all individual stars. We investigate the overall metallicity\ndistributions as well as those of the different populations within each\ncluster.\n  Methods. The Ca II triplet in the near-infrared at 8498, 8542, and 8662 AA is\nvisible in stars with spectral types between F and M and can be used to\ndetermine their metallicities. In this work, we calibrate the relation using\naverage cluster metallicities from literature and MUSE spectra, and extend it\nbelow the horizontal branch - a cutoff that has traditionally been made to\navoid a non-linear relation - using a quadratic function. In addition to the\nclassic relation based on V-VHB we also present calibrations based on absolute\nmagnitude and luminosity. The obtained relations are then used to calculate\nmetallicities for all the stars in the sample and to derive metallicity\ndistributions for different populations within a cluster, which have been\nseparated using so-called \"chromosome maps\" based on HST photometry.\n  Results. We show that, despite the relatively low spectral resolution of MUSE\n(R=1900-3700) we can derive single star metallicities with a mean statistical\nintra-cluster uncertainty of ~0.12 dex. We present metallicity distributions\nfor the RGB stars in 25 GCs, and investigate the different metallicities of the\npopulations P3 (and higher) in so-called metal-complex or Type II clusters,\nfinding metallicity variations in all of them.

Substantial\nbiases exist in most studies on the Milky Way's CGM that focus on\neasier-to-detect high-velocity gas. With mock observations on a Milky-Way\nanalog from the FOGGIE simulation, we investigate four observational biases\nrelated to the Milky Way's CGM. First, QSO absorption-line studies probe a\nlimited amount of the CGM mass: only 35% of the mass is at high Galactic\nlatitudes $|b|>20$ degrees, of which only half is moving at $|v_{\\rm\nLSR}|\\gtrsim100$ km s$^{-1}$. Second, the inflow rate ($\\dot{M}$) of the cold\ngas observable in HI 21cm is reduced by a factor of $\\sim10$ as we switch from\nthe local standard of rest to the galaxy's rest frame; meanwhile $\\dot{M}$ of\nthe cool and warm gas does not change significantly. Third, OVI and NV are\npromising ions to probe the Milky Way's outer CGM ($r\\gtrsim$15 kpc), but CIV\nmay be less sensitive. Lastly, the scatter in ion column density is a factor of\n2 higher if the CGM is observed from inside-out than from external views\nbecause of the gas radial density profile. Our work highlights that\nobservations of the Milky Way's CGM, especially those using HI 21cm and QSO\nabsorption lines, are highly biased.

This study explores, for the first time, the knowledge status on the\ntopic on a sample of N=191 secondary school students and Y=29\nPhysics-and-Chemistry trainee teachers in the Spanish region of Valencia. To\nthis aim, a revised version of a diagnostic tool developed by Martins\n\\cite{Mar92} has been employed. In general, the results reveal an evolution\nfrom a widespread dissenting notion on the phenomenon, which is staunchly\nrelated to danger, hazard and destruction in the lowest educational levels,\ntowards a more rational, relative and multidimensional perspective in the\nhighest ones. Furthermore, the great overlap of the ideas, emotions and\nattitudes of the inquired individuals with the main misconceptions and\nconceptual mistakes reported in the literature for different educational\ncontexts unveils the urgent need to develop new teaching strategies leading to\na meaningful learning of the associated nuclear science concepts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jan 2020 19:19:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-25"}

The first\nheuristic uses a nearest node approach and the second assigns the closest\nvehicle (salesman). A comparison of heuristics with test-instances being in the\nEuclidean plane showed similar solution quality and runtime. On average, the\nnearest node solutions are approximately one percent better. The closest\nvehicle heuristic is especially important when the nodes (customers) are not\nknown in advance, e.g. for online routing. Whilst the nearest node is\npreferable when one vehicle has to be used multiple times to service all\ncustomers. The second contribution is a closed form formula that describes the\nmTSP distance dependent on the number of vehicles and customers. Increasing the\nnumber of salesman results in an approximately linear distance growth for\nuniformly distributed nodes in a Euclidean grid plane. The distance growth is\nalmost proportional to the square root of number of customers (nodes). These\ntwo insights are combined in a single formula. The minimum distance of a node\nto $n$ uniformly distributed random (real and integer) points was derived and\nexpressed as functional relationship dependent on the number of vehicles. This\ngives theoretical underpinnings and is in agreement with the distances found\nvia the previous mTSP heuristics. Hence, this allows to compute all expected\nmTSP distances without the need of running the heuristics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jan 2020 19:26:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Jan 2020 08:54:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-31"}

We\nstudy whether such causal structure can be understood in terms of compositional\nstructure of the unitary. Given a quantum circuit with no path from input\nsystem $A$ to output system $B$, system $A$ cannot influence system $B$.\nConversely, given a unitary $U$ with a no-influence relation from input $A$ to\noutput $B$, it follows from [B. Schumacher and M. D. Westmoreland, Quantum\nInformation Processing 4 no. 1, (Feb, 2005)] that there exists a circuit\ndecomposition of $U$ with no path from $A$ to $B$. However, as we argue, there\nare unitaries for which there does not exist a circuit decomposition that makes\nall causal constraints evident simultaneously. To address this, we introduce a\nnew formalism of `extended circuit diagrams', which goes beyond what is\nexpressible with quantum circuits, with the core new feature being the ability\nto represent direct sum structures in addition to sequential and tensor product\ncomposition. A causally faithful extended circuit decomposition, representing a\nunitary $U$, is then one for which there is a path from an input $A$ to an\noutput $B$ if and only if there actually is influence from $A$ to $B$ in $U$.\nWe derive causally faithful extended circuit decompositions for a large class\nof unitaries, where in each case, the decomposition is implied by the unitary's\nrespective causal structure.

Recent datasets extracted from hospital\narchives, e.g., DeepLesion, have begun to address this problem. However, these\nare often incompletely or noisily labeled, e.g., DeepLesion leaves over 50% of\nits lesions unlabeled. Thus, effective methods to harvest missing annotations\nare critical for continued progress in medical image analysis. This is the goal\nof our work, where we develop a powerful system to harvest missing lesions from\nthe DeepLesion dataset at high precision. Accepting the need for some degree of\nexpert labor to achieve high fidelity, we exploit a small fully-labeled subset\nof medical image volumes and use it to intelligently mine annotations from the\nremainder. To do this, we chain together a highly sensitive lesion proposal\ngenerator and a very selective lesion proposal classifier. While our framework\nis generic, we optimize our performance by proposing a 3D contextual lesion\nproposal generator and by using a multi-view multi-scale lesion proposal\nclassifier. These produce harvested and hard-negative proposals, which we then\nre-use to finetune our proposal generator by using a novel hard negative\nsuppression loss, continuing this process until no extra lesions are found.\nExtensive experimental analysis demonstrates that our method can harvest an\nadditional 9,805 lesions while keeping precision above 90%.

Our\nsample consists of 62 X-ray detected groups and clusters, spanning a mass range\nof $10^{13.4}M_{\\odot}<~M_{500}<10^{15}M_{\\odot}$ and redshifts of\n$0.03\\lesssim z \\lesssim 0.82$. We extract the total SZ flux from unresolved\nPlanck data and estimate the fraction of the SZ flux within $R_{500}$ assuming\ntwo different pressure profiles. The SZ scaling relations were derived using a\nBayesian technique that accounts for censored data. We find a power law slope\nof $1.73^{+0.19}_{-0.18}$ for the $Y_{SZ}-M_{500}$ relation which is consistent\nwith the self-similar prediction of 5/3. The slope of $0.89^{+0.09}_{-0.08}$\nfor the $Y_{SZ}-L_{X,500}$ relation is in agreement with other observational\nstudies but not the self-similar prediction of 5/4, and the $Y_{SZ}-Y_{X}$\nrelation lies below the 1:1 relation when the slope is fixed to unity. The\ndetermined scaling relations are dependent on the selected pressure profile, so\nresolved data are needed to determine the effects of AGN feedback. In addition,\nwe find a number of potential cluster candidates in the Planck Compton maps\nthat were not identified in our X-ray sample.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jan 2020 22:53:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-04"}

An\nunusual property of progesterone is its high affinity for the mineralocorticoid\nreceptor (MR), which regulates electrolyte transport in the kidney in humans\nand other terrestrial vertebrates. In humans, rats, alligators and frogs,\nprogesterone antagonizes activation of the MR by aldosterone, the physiological\nmineralocorticoid in terrestrial vertebrates. In contrast, in elephant shark,\nray-finned fishes and chickens, progesterone activates the MR. Interestingly,\ncartilaginous fishes and ray-finned fishes do not synthesize aldosterone,\nraising the question of which steroid(s) activate the MR in cartilaginous\nfishes and ray-finned fishes. The simpler synthesis of progesterone, compared\nto cortisol and other corticosteroids, makes progesterone a candidate\nphysiological activator of the MR in elephant sharks and ray-finned fishes.\nElephant shark and ray-finned fish MRs are expressed in diverse tissues,\nincluding heart, brain and lung, as well as, ovary and testis, two reproductive\ntissues that are targets for progesterone, which together suggests a\nmulti-faceted physiological role for progesterone activation of the MR in\nelephant shark and ray-finned fish.

In particular, a wireless\nnetwork is considered in which wireless users transmit their local FL models\n(trained using their locally collected data) to a base station (BS). The BS,\nacting as a central controller, generates a global FL model using the received\nlocal FL models and broadcasts it back to all users. Due to the limited number\nof resource blocks (RBs) in a wireless network, only a subset of users can be\nselected to transmit their local FL model parameters to the BS at each learning\nstep. Moreover, since each user has unique training data samples, the BS\nprefers to include all local user FL models to generate a converged global FL\nmodel. Hence, the FL performance and convergence time will be significantly\naffected by the user selection scheme. Therefore, it is necessary to design an\nappropriate user selection scheme that enables users of higher importance to be\nselected more frequently. This joint learning, wireless resource allocation,\nand user selection problem is formulated as an optimization problem whose goal\nis to minimize the FL convergence time while optimizing the FL performance. To\nsolve this problem, a probabilistic user selection scheme is proposed such that\nthe BS is connected to the users whose local FL models have significant effects\non its global FL model with high probabilities. Given the user selection\npolicy, the uplink RB allocation can be determined. To further reduce the FL\nconvergence time, artificial neural networks (ANNs) are used to estimate the\nlocal FL models of the users that are not allocated any RBs for local FL model\ntransmission at each given learning step, which enables the BS to enhance its\nglobal FL model and improve the FL convergence speed and performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jan 2020 01:55:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Mar 2021 13:28:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-29"}

Therefore, an all-purpose anomaly detection method\nthat can detect virtually all types of lesions/diseases in a given image is\nstrongly desired. However, few commercially available and versatile anomaly\ndetection methods for medical images have been provided so far. Recently,\nanomaly detection methods built upon deep learning methods have been rapidly\ngrowing in popularity, and these methods seem to provide reasonable solutions\nto the problem. However, the workload to label the images necessary for\ntraining in deep learning remains heavy. In this study, we present an anomaly\ndetection method based on two trained flow-based generative models. With this\nmethod, the posterior probability can be computed as a normality metric for any\ngiven image. The training of the generative models requires two sets of images:\na set containing only normal images and another set containing both normal and\nabnormal images without any labels. In the latter set, each sample does not\nhave to be labeled as normal or abnormal; therefore, any mixture of images\n(e.g., all cases in a hospital) can be used as the dataset without cumbersome\nmanual labeling. The method was validated with two types of medical images:\nchest X-ray radiographs (CXRs) and brain computed tomographies (BCTs). The\nareas under the receiver operating characteristic curves for logarithm\nposterior probabilities of CXRs (0.868 for pneumonia-like opacities) and BCTs\n(0.904 for infarction) were comparable to those in previous studies with other\nanomaly detection methods.

Target shift is a problem of mismatch in label distribution\nbetween source and target domains. Typically it appears as class-imbalance in\ntarget domain. In practice, this is an important problem in UDA; as we do not\nknow labels in target domain datasets, we do not know whether or not its\ndistribution is identical to that in the source domain dataset. Many\ntraditional approaches achieve UDA with distribution matching by minimizing\nmean maximum discrepancy or adversarial training; however these approaches\nimplicitly assume a coincidence in the distributions and do not work under\nsituations with target shift. Some recent UDA approaches focus on class\nboundary and some of them are robust to target shift, but they are only\napplicable to classification and not to regression.\n  To overcome the target shift problem in UDA, the proposed method, partially\nshared variational autoencoders (PS-VAEs), uses pair-wise feature alignment\ninstead of feature distribution matching. PS-VAEs inter-convert domain of each\nsample by a CycleGAN-based architecture while preserving its label-related\ncontent. To evaluate the performance of PS-VAEs, we carried out two\nexperiments: UDA with class-unbalanced digits datasets (classification), and\nUDA from synthesized data to real observation in human-pose-estimation\n(regression). The proposed method presented its robustness against the\nclass-imbalance in the classification task, and outperformed the other methods\nin the regression task with a large margin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jan 2020 06:41:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 23 Jan 2020 05:45:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 25 Jan 2020 05:41:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-28"}

However, a principled and robust way to combine shape and pose\nfeatures has been illusive due to three main issues: 1) Non-homogeneity of the\ndata (data with linear and non-linear natural variation across features), 2)\nnon-optimal representation of the $3D$ motion (rigid transformation\nrepresentations that are not proportional to the kinetic energy that move an\nobject from one position to the other), and 3) artificial discretization of the\nmodels. In this paper, we propose a new framework for dynamic multi-object\nstatistical modelling framework for the analysis of human joints in a\ncontinuous domain. Specifically, we propose to normalise shape and dynamic\nspatial features in the same linearized statistical space permitting the use of\nlinear statistics; we adopt an optimal 3D motion representation for more\naccurate rigid transformation comparisons; and we provide a 3D shape and pose\nprediction protocol using a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling-based fitting.\nThe framework affords an efficient generative dynamic multi-object modelling\nplatform for biological joints. We validate the framework using a controlled\nsynthetic data. Finally, the framework is applied to an analysis of the human\nshoulder joint to compare its performance with standard SSM approaches in\nprediction of shape while adding the advantage of determining relative pose\nbetween bones in a complex. Excellent validity is observed and the shoulder\njoint shape-pose prediction results suggest that the novel framework may have\nutility for a range of medical image analysis applications.

The\nunderlying hidden spin-density wave groundstate is therefore a Mott insulator.\nUpon electron doping, Eliashberg theory finds that the spectral weights of the\nhole Fermi surface pockets remain vanishingly small, while the spectral weights\nof the larger electron Fermi surface pockets become appreciable. This\nprediction is therefore consistent with the observation of electron Fermi\nsurface pockets alone in electron-doped iron selenide by angle-resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Eliashberg theory also finds an instability\nto S+- superconductivity at electron doping, with isotropic Cooper pairs that\nalternate in sign between the visible electron Fermi surface pockets and the\nfaint hole Fermi surface pockets. Comparison with the isotropic energy gaps\nobserved in electron-doped iron selenide by ARPES and by scanning tunneling\nmicroscopy (STM) is consistent with short-range hidden magnetic order.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jan 2020 08:16:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 08:17:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 27 May 2021 07:32:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-28"}

The similarity identification task is to identify the items in a\ndatabase that are similar to a given query item for a given metric. The problem\nof compression for similarity identification has been studied in\narXiv:1307.6609 [cs.IT]. Unlike classical compression problems, the focus is\nnot on reconstructing the original data. Instead, the compression rate is\ndetermined by the desired reliability of the answers. Specifically, the\ninformation measure identification rate characterizes the minimum rate that can\nbe achieved among all schemes which guarantee reliable answers with respect to\na given similarity threshold. In this paper, we propose a component-based model\nfor computing correlated similarity queries. The correlated signals are first\ndecorrelated by the KLT transform. Then, the decorrelated signal is processed\nby a distinct D-admissible system for each component. We show that the\ncomponent-based model equipped with KLT can perfectly represent the\nmultivariate Gaussian similarity queries when optimal rate-similarity\nallocation applies.

[1]. GRAMSES adopts a constant mean curvature slicing with a\nminimal distortion gauge, where the linear growth rate is scale-dependent, and\nthe standard method for realising initial particle data is not\nstraightforwardly applicable. A new method is introduced, in which the initial\npositions of particles are generated from the displacement field realised for a\nmatter power spectrum as usual, but the velocity is calculated by\nfinite-differencing the displacement fields around the initial redshift. In\nthis way, all the information required for setting up the initial conditions is\ndrawn from three consecutive input matter power spectra, and additional\nassumptions such as scale-independence of the linear growth factor and growth\nrate are not needed. We implement this method in a modified 2LPTic code, and\ndemonstrate that in a Newtonian setting it can reproduce the velocity field\ngiven by the default 2LPTic code with subpercent accuracy. We also show that\nthe matter and velocity power spectra of the initial particle data generated\nfor GRAMSES simulations using this method agree very well with the\nlinear-theory predictions in the particular gauge used by GRAMSES. Finally, we\ndiscuss corrections to the finite difference calculation of the velocity when\nradiation is present, as well as additional corrections implemented in GRAMSES\nto ensure consistency. This method can be applied in ICs generation for GR\nsimulations in generic gauges, and simulations of cosmological models with\nscale-dependent linear growth rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jan 2020 11:40:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Apr 2020 10:11:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-06"}

Since these missions will be sensitive to stellar\noscillations and granulation even for dwarf stars, they will be limited by\nstellar variability. We tested the performance of Gaussian process (GP)\nregression on the characterisation of transiting planets, and in particular to\ndetermine how many components of variability are necessary to describe high\ncadence, high signal-to-noise light curves expected from CHEOPS and PLATO. We\nfound that the best GP stellar variability model contains four to five\nvariability components: one stellar oscillation component, two to four\ngranulation components, and/or one rotational modulation component. This high\nnumber of components is in contrast with the one-component GP model (1GP)\ncommonly used in the literature for transit characterisation. Therefore, we\ncompared the performance of the best multi-component GP model with the 1GP\nmodel in the derivation of transit parameters of simulated transits. We found\nthat for Jupiter- and Neptune-size planets the best multi-component GP model is\nslightly better than the 1GP model, and much better than the non-GP model that\ngives biased results. For Earth-size planets, the 1GP model fails to retrieve\nthe transit because it is a poor description of stellar activity. The non-GP\nmodel gives some biased results and the best multi-component GP is capable of\nretrieving the correct transit model parameters. We conclude that when\ncharacterising transiting exoplanets with high signal-to-noise ratios and high\ncadence light curves, we need models that couple the description of stellar\nvariability with the transits analysis, like GPs. Moreover, for Earth-like\nexoplanets a better description of stellar variability improves the planetary\ncharacterisation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jan 2020 11:57:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-12"}

Among them is the\nnonlocal multicontinua (NLMC) method, which introduces multiple macroscopic\nvariables in each computational grid. These approaches explore the entire\ncoarse block resolution and one can obtain optimal convergence results\nindependent of contrast and scales. However, these approaches are not amenable\nto many multiscale simulations, where the subgrid effects are much smaller than\nthe coarse-mesh resolution. For example, the molecular dynamics of shale gas\noccurs in much smaller length scales compared to the coarse-mesh size, which is\nof orders of meters. In this case, one can not explore the entire coarse-grid\nresolution in evaluating effective properties. In this paper, we merge the\nconcepts of nonlocal multicontinua methods and Representative Volume Element\n(RVE) concepts to explore problems with extreme scale separation. The first\nstep of this approach is to use sub-grid scale (sub to RVE) to write a\nlarge-scale macroscopic system. We call it intermediate scale macroscale\nsystem.

In\nthese domains, a key challenge is learning with a few good experiences, i.e.,\npositive reinforcements are obtained only in a few situations (e.g., on\nextinguishing a fire or tracking a crime or delivering a package) and in most\nother situations there is zero or negative reinforcement. Learning decisions\nwith a few good experiences is extremely challenging in cooperative MARL\nproblems due to three reasons. First, compared to the single agent case,\nexploration is harder as multiple agents have to be coordinated to receive a\ngood experience. Second, environment is not stationary as all the agents are\nlearning at the same time (and hence change policies). Third, scale of problem\nincreases significantly with every additional agent.\n  Relevant existing work is extensive and has focussed on dealing with a few\ngood experiences in single-agent RL problems or on scalable approaches for\nhandling non-stationarity in MARL problems. Unfortunately, neither of these\napproaches (or their extensions) are able to address the problem of sparse good\nexperiences effectively.

Previous work on\nmotion planning has followed two main strategies to provide a safe bound on an\nobstacle's space: a polyhedron, such as a cuboid, or a nonlinear differentiable\nsurface, such as an ellipsoid. The former approach relies on disjunctive\nprogramming, which has a relatively high computational cost that grows\nexponentially with the number of obstacles. The latter approach needs to be\nlinearized locally to find a tractable evaluation of the chance constraints,\nwhich dramatically reduces the remaining free space and leads to\nover-conservative trajectories or even unfeasibility. In this work, we present\na hybrid approach that eludes the pitfalls of both strategies while maintaining\nthe original safety guarantees. The key idea consists in obtaining a safe\ndifferentiable approximation for the disjunctive chance constraints bounding\nthe obstacles. The resulting nonlinear optimization problem is free of chance\nconstraint linearization and disjunctive programming, and therefore, it can be\nefficiently solved to meet fast real-time requirements with multiple obstacles.\nWe validate our approach through mathematical proof, simulation and real\nexperiments with an aerial robot using nonlinear model predictive control to\navoid pedestrians.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jan 2020 13:47:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 7 May 2020 08:15:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-08"}

The\noscillations are rectified due to the hydrodynamic nonlinearities leading to\nthe helicity sensitive circular dc current and to a magnetic moment. This\nhydrodynamic inverse Faraday effect (HIFE) can be observed at room temperature\nin different materials. The HIFE is dramatically enhanced in a periodic array\nof the nanospheres forming a resonant plasmonic coupler.

We hereby\nprovide such an analysis, by deriving the relevant framework from first\nprinciples. Building on a microscopic model of the bath, we first express heat,\nwork and entropy production for the closed qubit-bath system where these\ndefinitions are unambiguous. We coarse-grain the obtained expressions, using a\nmethodology similar to the derivation of the dynamical master equation and\ngiving rise to consistent expressions of the First and Second Law. We verify\nthat long coarse graining times yield the Floquet Master Equation and its\nalready known thermodynamic description. Conversely, short coarse-graining\ntimes yield the OBE and its consistent thermodynamic framework, whose variables\nexplicitly depend on the quantum coherences in the qubit's energy basis. These\nquantum signatures in the heat and in the entropy production flows allow us to\ncharacterize a genuinely quantum non-equilibrium situation, where the\ncoherences created by the driving field are continuously erased by the bath.\nOur findings can be readily extended to larger open quantum systems.

We also show that the quantum Hamiltonian reduction of\n$V^{(p)}$ is the logarithmic doublet algebra $A^{(p)}$ introduced in [12],\nwhile the reduction of $R^{(p)}$ yields the $B^{(p)}$-algebra of [39].\nConversely, we realize $V^{(p)}$ and $R^{(p)}$ from $A^{(p)}$ and $B^{(p)}$ via\na procedure that deserves to be called inverse quantum Hamiltonian reduction.\nAs a corollary, we obtain that the category $KL_{k}$ of ordinary\n$L_k(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$-modules at level $k=-2+1/p$ is a rigid vertex tensor\ncategory equivalent to a twist of the category Rep$(SU(2))$. This finally\ncompletes rigid braided tensor category structures for $L_k(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$\nat all levels $k$.\n  We also establish a uniqueness result of certain vertex operator algebra\nextensions and use this result to prove that both $R^{(p)}$ and $B^{(p)}$ are\ncertain non-principal W-algebras of type $A$ at boundary admissible levels. The\nsame uniqueness result also shows that $R^{(p)}$ and $B^{(p)}$ are the chiral\nalgebras of Argyres-Douglas theories of type $(A_1, D_{2p})$ and $(A_1,\nA_{2p-3})$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jan 2020 15:05:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-23"}

This work models the gyrotactic plume as a steady parallel basic state\nand its subsequent breakdown into blips as an instability, employing both the\nGeneralised Taylor Dispersion (GTD) theory and the Fokker-Planck model for\ncomparison. Upon solving for the basic state, it is discovered that the steady\nplume solution undergoes sophisticated bifurcations.

Whether this so-called dearth region is a\npeculiarity of stars in the Kepler field, or reflects a general manifestation\nof stellar magnetic activity, is still under debate. Our goal is to measure\nstellar rotation periods and photometric variabilities for tens of thousands of\nK2 stars, located in different fields along the ecliptic plane, to shed light\non the relation between stellar rotation and photometric variability. We use\nLomb-Scargle periodograms, auto-correlation and wavelet functions to determine\nconsistent rotation periods. Stellar brightness variability is assessed by\ncomputing the variability range from the light curve. We further apply Gaussian\nmixture models to search for bimodality in the rotation period distribution.\nCombining measurements from all K2 campaigns, we detect rotation periods in\n29,860 stars. For effective temperatures below 6000K, the variability range\nshows a local minimum at different periods, consistent with an isochrone age of\n750 Myr. Additionally, the K2 rotation period distribution shows evidence for\nbimodality, although the dearth region is less pronounced compared to the\nKepler field. The period at the dip of the bimodal distribution shows good\nagreement with the period at the local variability minimum. We conclude that\nthe period bimodality is present in different fields of the sky, and is hence a\ngeneral manifestation of stellar magnetic activity. The reduced variability in\nthe dearth region is interpreted as a cancelation between dark spots and bright\nfaculae. Our results strongly advocate that the role of faculae has been\nunderestimated so far, suggesting a more complex dependence of the brightness\nvariability on the rotation period.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jan 2020 15:20:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-04"}

Inspired by its success in deep\nlearning, we apply the idea of SGD with batch selection of samples to a classic\noptimization problem in decision version. Given $n$ unit circles, the equal\ncircle packing problem (ECPP) asks whether there exist a feasible packing that\ncould put all the circles inside a circular container without overlapping.\nSpecifically, we propose a stochastic item descent method (SIDM) for ECPP in\nlarge scale, which randomly divides the unit circles into batches and runs\nBroyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) algorithm on the corresponding batch\nfunction iteratively to speedup the calculation.

Comparing to\nthe current best packing algorithms, SIDM greatly speeds up the calculation of\noptimization process and guarantees the solution quality for large scale\ninstances with up to 1500 circle items, while the baseline algorithms usually\nhandle about 300 circle items.

In this paper, we show\nhow a robust model predictive control (MPC) with PVO constraints under\nnon-parametric uncertainty can be made computationally tractable. At the core\nof our formulation is a novel yet simple interpretation of our robust MPC as a\nproblem of matching the distribution of PVO with a certain desired\ndistribution. To this end, we propose two methods. Our first baseline method is\nbased on approximating the distribution of PVO with a Gaussian Mixture Model\n(GMM) and subsequently performing distribution matching using Kullback Leibler\n(KL) divergence metric. Our second formulation is based on the possibility of\nrepresenting arbitrary distributions as functions in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert\nSpace (RKHS). We use this foundation to interpret our robust MPC as a problem\nof minimizing the distance between the desired distribution and the\ndistribution of the PVO in the RKHS. Both the RKHS and GMM based formulation\ncan work with any uncertainty distribution and thus allowing us to relax the\nprevalent Gaussian assumption in the existing works. We validate our\nformulation by taking an example of 2D navigation of quadrotors with a\nrealistic noise model for perception and ego-motion uncertainty. In particular,\nwe present a systematic comparison between the GMM and the RKHS approach and\nshow that while both approaches can produce safe trajectories, the former is\nhighly conservative and leads to poor tracking and control costs. Furthermore,\nRKHS based approach gives better computational times that are up to one order\nof magnitude lesser than the computation time of the GMM based approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 21 Jan 2020 19:09:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-27"}

We explore if by\nconsidering the generated overhead, NN is still able to improve the results,\nand under which condition is able to do so.\n  The main difficulties to train the NN are: 1) to get enough samples to\ngeneralize predictions for new data, and 2) to obtain reliable samples. As NN\nneeds to collect data at each time step, if the time horizon is short, we will\nnot be able to collect enough samples to train the NN. To alleviate this, we\npropose to consider more individuals on each change to speed up sample\ncollection in shorter time steps. In environments with a high frequency of\nchanges, the solutions produced by EA are likely to be far from the real\noptimum. Using unreliable train data for the NN will, in consequence, produce\nunreliable predictions.

The\nbiSBM improves community detection results over general SBMs when data are\nnoisy, improves the model resolution limit by a factor of $\\sqrt{2}$, and\nexpands our understanding of the complicated optimization landscape associated\nwith community detection tasks. A direct comparison of certain terms of the\nprior distributions in the biSBM and a related high-resolution hierarchical SBM\nalso reveals a counterintuitive regime of community detection problems,\npopulated by smaller and sparser networks, where nonhierarchical models\noutperform their more flexible counterpart.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 22 Jan 2020 05:58:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Sep 2020 07:38:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-30"}

The success of deep learning models solicits architecture engineering\nrather than hand-engineering the features. However, designing state-of-the-art\nCNN for a given task remains a non-trivial and challenging task, especially\nwhen training data size is less. To address this phenomena, transfer learning\nhas been used as a popularly adopted technique. While transferring the learned\nknowledge from one task to another, fine-tuning with the target-dependent Fully\nConnected (FC) layers generally produces better results over the target task.\nIn this paper, the proposed AutoFCL model attempts to learn the structure of FC\nlayers of a CNN automatically using Bayesian optimization. To evaluate the\nperformance of the proposed AutoFCL, we utilize five pre-trained CNN models\nsuch as VGG-16, ResNet, DenseNet, MobileNet, and NASNetMobile. The experiments\nare conducted on three benchmark datasets, namely CalTech-101, Oxford-102\nFlowers, and UC Merced Land Use datasets. Fine-tuning the newly learned\n(target-dependent) FC layers leads to state-of-the-art performance, according\nto the experiments carried out in this research. The proposed AutoFCL method\noutperforms the existing methods over CalTech-101 and Oxford-102 Flowers\ndatasets by achieving the accuracy of 94.38% and 98.89%, respectively.

In the vicinity of boundaries, these particles exhibit rich\nbehavior, such as the occurrence of wall-bound steady states of \"sliding\". Most\nactive particles tend to sediment as they are density mismatched with the\nsolution. Moreover Janus spheres, which consist of an inert core material\ndecorated with a cap-like, thin layer of a catalyst, are gyrotactic\n(\"bottom-heavy\"). Occurrence of sliding states near the horizontal walls\ndepends on the interplay between the active motion and the gravity-driven\nsedimentation and alignment. It is thus important to understand and quantify\nthe influence of these gravity-induced effects on the behavior of model\nchemically active particles moving near walls. For model gyrotactic,\nself-phoretic Janus particles, here we study theoretically the occurrence of\nsliding states at horizontal planar walls that are either below (\"floor\") or\nabove (\"ceiling\") the particle. We construct \"state diagrams\" characterizing\nthe occurrence of such states as a function of the sedimentation velocity and\nof the gyrotactic response of the particle, as well as of the phoretic mobility\nof the particle. We show that in certain cases sliding states may emerge\nsimultaneously at both the ceiling and the floor, while the larger part of the\nexperimentally relevant parameter space corresponds to particles that would\nexhibit sliding states only either at the floor or at the ceiling or there are\nno sliding states at all.

Building on the algorithm of\nBen-Or and Tiwari for interpolating polynomials over rings with characteristic\nzero, we develop a new Monte Carlo algorithm over the finite field by doing\nadditional probes. To interpolate a polynomial $f\\in F_q[x_1,\\dots,x_n]$ with a\npartial degree bound $D$ and a term bound $T$, our new algorithm costs\n$O^\\thicksim(nT\\log ^2q+nT\\sqrt{D}\\log q)$ bit operations and uses $2(n+1)T$\nprobes to the black box. If $q\\geq O(nT^2D)$, it has constant success rate to\nreturn the correct polynomial. Compared with previous algorithms over general\nfinite field, our algorithm has better complexity in the parameters $n,T,D$ and\nis the first one to achieve the complexity of fractional power about $D$, while\nkeeping linear in $n,T$. A key technique is a randomization which makes all\ncoefficients of the unknown polynomial distinguishable, producing a diverse\npolynomial. This approach, called diversification, was proposed by Giesbrecht\nand Roche in 2011. Our algorithm interpolates each variable independently using\n$O(T)$ probes, and then uses the diversification to correlate terms in\ndifferent images. At last, we get the exponents by solving the discrete\nlogarithms and obtain coefficients by solving a linear system. We have\nimplemented our algorithm in Maple. Experimental results shows that our\nalgorithm can applied to sparse polynomials with large degree.
