It is associated with energy release\nin regions of magnetic field annihilation, but this is only one facet of this\nprocess. Astrophysical flows normally have very large Reynolds numbers and are\nexpected to be turbulent, in agreement with observations. In strong turbulence\nmagnetic lines constantly reconnect everywhere at all scales, making magnetic\nreconnection an intrinsic part of turbulent cascade. We note that this is\ninconsistent with the usual practice of regarding magnetic lines as persistent\ndynamical elements. A number of theoretical, numerical, and observational\nstudies, starting with Lazarian & Vishniac (1999), demonstrated that 3D\nturbulence makes magnetic reconnection fast and that these two processes are\nintrinsically connected. We discuss the dramatic violation of the textbook\nconcept of magnetic flux-freezing in the presence of turbulence and demonstrate\nthat in the presence of turbulence the plasma effects are subdominant to\nturbulence as far as the magnetic reconnection is concerned. This justifies an\nMHD-like treatment of magnetic reconnection at scales much larger than the\nrelevant plasma scales. We discuss numerical and observational evidences\nsupporting the turbulent reconnection model. In particular, we show that\ntearing reconnection is suppressed in 3D and, unlike the 2D case, the 3D\nreconnection induces turbulence that makes reconnection independent of\nresistivity. We show that turbulent reconnection dramatically affects the key\nastrophysical processes, e.g., star formation, turbulent dynamo, acceleration\nof cosmic rays. We provide criticism of the concept of \"reconnection-mediated\nturbulence\" and explain why turbulent reconnection is very different from\nenhanced turbulent resistivity and hyper-resistivity, and why the latter has\nfatal conceptual flaws.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jan 2020 16:01:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-19"}

We have built an\nautomated alignment system (Robotilters) to solve this challenge, optimizing 4\ndegrees of freedom - 2 tilt axes, a separation axis (the distance between the\nCCD and lens), and the lens focus (the built-in focus of the lens by turning\nthe lens focusing ring which moves the optical elements relative to one\nanother) in a compact and low-cost package.

This is to permit clients to access this huge\nmeasure of processing resources without the need to know where these might be\nfound and what technology such as, hardware equipment and operating system was\nused. Dependability and performance are among the key difficulties faced in a\ngrid computing environment. Various systems have been proposed in the\nliterature to handle recouping from resource failure in Grid computing\nenvironment. One case of such system is checkpointing. Checkpointing is a\nsystem that endures faults when resources failed. Checkpointing method has the\nupside of lessening the work lost because of resource faults.

In\ncontrast to the strong formulation, where the problem is formulated on a fixed\nprobability space equipped with two Brownian filtrations, the weak formulation\nis obtained by considering a more general probability space with two\nfiltrations satisfying an $(H)$-hypothesis type condition from the theory of\nenlargement of filtrations. When the common noise is uncontrolled, our relaxed\nformulation is obtained by considering a suitable controlled martingale\nproblem. As for classical optimal control problems, we prove that the set of\nall relaxed controls is the closure of the set of all strong controls, when\nconsidered as probability measures on the canonical space. Consequently, we\nobtain the equivalence of the different formulations of the control problem,\nunder additional mild regularity conditions on the reward functions.

High quality solutions of NP-hard\ncombinatorial optimization problems can be encoded into low energy states of\nspin-glass systems.

Ideally, one could use recent advances in deep\nlearning for characterizing the low-energy properties of these complex systems.\nUnfortunately, many of the most promising machine learning approaches are only\nvalid for distributions over continuous variables and thus cannot be directly\napplied to discrete spin-glass models.

Here we address\ncloud formation processes by combining HSIA with molecular line data. One\nscenario proposed by numerical simulations is that the column density\nprobability density functions (N-PDF) evolves from a log-normal shape at early\ntimes to a power-law-like shape at later times. In this paper, we study the\ncold atomic component of the giant molecular filament GMF38a (d=3.4 kpc,\nlength$\\sim230$ pc). We identify an extended HISA feature, which is partly\ncorrelated with the 13CO emission. The peak velocities of the HISA and 13CO\nobservations agree well on the eastern side of the filament, whereas a velocity\noffset of approximately 4 km s$^{-1}$ is found on the western side. The sonic\nMach number we derive from the linewidth measurements shows that a large\nfraction of the HISA, which is ascribed to the cold neutral medium (CNM), is at\nsubsonic and transonic velocities. The column density of the CNM is on the\norder of 10$^{20}$ to 10$^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$. The column density of molecular\nhydrogen is an order of magnitude higher. The N-PDFs from HISA (CNM), HI\nemission (WNM+CNM), and 13CO (molecular component) are well described by\nlog-normal functions, which is in agreement with turbulent motions being the\nmain driver of cloud dynamics. The N-PDF of the molecular component also shows\na power law in the high column-density region, indicating self-gravity. We\nsuggest that we are witnessing two different evolutionary stages within the\nfilament. The eastern subregion seems to be forming a molecular cloud out of\nthe atomic gas, whereas the western subregion already shows high column density\npeaks, active star formation and evidence of related feedback processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jan 2020 19:00:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-03-04"}

In this paper,\nwe establish quantitative trends from experiments conducted within a large\nrange of parameters, namely the amplitude $A$ and frequency $f$ of the forcing,\nthe liquid viscosity $\\eta$ and the angle between the substrate and the forcing\naxis $\\alpha$. These experiments are carried out on weak-pinning substrates.\nFor most parameters sets, the averaged velocity $<v>$ grows linearly with $A$.\nWe extract the mobility, defined as $s=\\frac{\\Delta <v>}{\\Delta A}$. It is\nfound that $s$ can show a sharp maximal value close to the resonance frequency\nof the first axisymmetric mode $f_p$. The value of $s$ tends to be almost\nindependent on $\\eta$ below 50 cSt, while $s$ decreases significantly for\nhigher $\\eta$. Also, it is found that for peculiar sets of parameters,\nparticularly with $f$ far enough from $f_p$, the drop moves in the reverse\ndirection. Finally, we draw a relationship between $<v>$ and the averaged\nvalues of the dynamical contact angles at both sides of the drop over one\nperiod of oscillation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jan 2020 20:12:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-12"}

The outcome of a test on a subset of items is positive if the subset has\nat least $u$ defective items, negative if it has up to $\\ell$ defective items,\nwhere $0\\leq\\ell<u$, and arbitrary otherwise.

The second is an improvement in the construction of\ndisjunct matrices, which are the main tools for tackling (threshold) group\ntesting and other tasks such as constructing cover-free families or learning\nhidden graphs. The third and fourth contributions are a reduced exact upper\nbound on the number of tests and a reduced asymptotic bound on the decoding\ntime for identifying defective items in a noisy setting on test outcomes. The\nfifth contribution is a simulation on the number of tests of the resulting\nimprovements for previous work and the proposed theorems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jan 2020 23:28:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 May 2020 14:46:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 21 Aug 2021 01:24:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-24"}

The\ninnovation aspects of this study are: First, there have been no commercialized\nactive ankle exoskeletons available in the market. All the available\nexoskeletons have passive ankle joints, which cannot mimic human movement,\nespecially in normal and fast walking [1]. Second, the Winding Filament Model\nController (WFMC) is the first control strategy based on a muscle model that\ndoes not use an electromyographic (EMG) signal as an input. The activation,\nwhich is calculated from EMG, is a crucial input parameter for almost all of\nthe control strategies based on muscle modeling. However, the winding filament\nmuscle model can predict muscle force by using muscle length as the primary\ninput, and the activation input signal could be either a square wave [33] or a\nsimple bell shape function like our study. This is one of the most important\nbenefits of the WFMC strategy, since it makes this bioinspired strategy\napplicable for all patient populations, even those with impaired muscle\nactivities or without muscle activities (e.g. stroke, spinal cord injury,\nParkinson disease, etc.).

We study the hosts of BNS mergers\nin the context of structure formation by populating the Universe Machine\nsimulations with gravitational-wave events~ according to a simple time-delay\nmodel. We find that different time-delay distributions predict different\nproperties of the associated host galaxies, including the distributions of\nstellar mass, star-formation rate, halo mass, and local and large-scale\nclustering of hosts. BNSs that merge today with short delay times prefer to be\nin hosts that have high star-formation rates, while those with long delay times\nlive in dense regions within massive halos that have low star formation. We\nshow that with ${\\mathcal O}(10)$ events from current gravitational-wave\ndetector networks, it is possible to make preliminary distinctions between\nformation channels which trace stellar mass, halo mass, or star-formation rate.\nWe also find that strategies to follow up gravitational-wave events with\nelectromagnetic telescopes can be significantly optimized using the clustering\nproperties of their hosts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Jan 2020 03:08:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-16"}

Existing pruning methods either\ntrain from scratch with sparsity constraints or minimize the reconstruction\nerror between the feature maps of the pre-trained models and the compressed\nones. Both strategies suffer from some limitations: the former kind is\ncomputationally expensive and difficult to converge, while the latter kind\noptimizes the reconstruction error but ignores the discriminative power of\nchannels. In this paper, we propose a simple-yet-effective method called\ndiscrimination-aware channel pruning (DCP) to choose the channels that actually\ncontribute to the discriminative power. Note that a channel often consists of a\nset of kernels. Besides the redundancy in channels, some kernels in a channel\nmay also be redundant and fail to contribute to the discriminative power of the\nnetwork, resulting in kernel level redundancy. To solve this, we propose a\ndiscrimination-aware kernel pruning (DKP) method to further compress deep\nnetworks by removing redundant kernels. To prevent DCP/DKP from selecting\nredundant channels/kernels, we propose a new adaptive stopping condition, which\nhelps to automatically determine the number of selected channels/kernels and\noften results in more compact models with better performance. Extensive\nexperiments on both image classification and face recognition demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our methods.

In\nthe original model, each voter changes its opinion with a certain probability\n$\\epsilon$ if the group of influence is not unanimous. In contrast, the\nmodified version introduces two types of voters that act in a deterministic way\nin case of disagreement in the influence group: the fraction $\\epsilon$ of\nvoters always change their current opinion, whereas the rest of them always\nmaintain it. Although both concepts of randomness lead to the same average\nnumber of opinion changes in the system on the microscopic level, they cause\nqualitatively distinct results on the macroscopic level. We focus on the\nmean-field description of these models. Our approach relies on the stability\nanalysis by the linearization technique developed within dynamical system\ntheory. This approach allows us to derive complete, exact phase diagrams for\nboth models. The results obtained in this paper indicate that quenched\nrandomness promotes continuous phase transitions to a greater extent, whereas\nannealed randomness favors discontinuous ones. The quenched model also creates\ncombinations of continuous and discontinuous phase transitions unobserved in\nthe annealed model, in which the up-down symmetry may be spontaneously broken\ninside or outside the hysteresis loop. The analytical results are confirmed by\nMonte Carlo simulations carried out on a complete graph.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Jan 2020 09:15:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Apr 2020 09:11:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-04-17"}

Direct\nmeasurement of their surface interaction can be interpreted to reveal\nfundamental physics in confinement, i.e. independent of the particular\ngeometry. However real solids are deformable - they can change shape due to\ntheir mutual interaction - and this can influence force measurements. These\naspects are frequently not considered, and remain poorly understood. We have\nperformed experiments in a dry atmosphere and across an ionic liquid with a\nSurface Force Balance (SFB), combining measurement of the surface interactions\nand simultaneous in-situ characterization of the geometry. First we find that,\nwhilst the variation of the contact radius with the force across dry nitrogen\ncan be interpreted by the Johnson-Kendall-Roberts (JKR) model, for the (ionic)\nliquid it is well described only by the Derjaguin-Muller-Toporov (DMT) model.\nSecondly, we find that mica does not only bend but also experiences a\ncompression. By performing experiments with substantially thicker mica than\nusual we were able to investigate this with high precision, and find\ncompression of order 1 nm with 7 um mica. These findings imply that, in some\ncases structural forces measured across nanoconfined liquids must be\ninterpreted as a convolution of the surface forces across the liquid and the\nmechanical response of the confining solids. We discuss the influence of mica\nthickness, and propose a scaling criterion to distinguish situations where the\nsolid deformation is negligible and when it is dominant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 4 Jan 2020 15:44:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-07"}

Compared to the circular shifting\napproach presented in prior work, our approach produces stochastic bit streams\nwith 67% less average SCC when a 10-bit LFSR is shared between two SNGs. To\ngeneralize our approach, we propose an algorithm to find a set of m\npermutations (n>m>2) with minimum pairwise SCC, for an n-bit LFSR. The search\nspace for finding permutations with exact minimum SCC grows rapidly when n\nincreases and it is intractable to perform a search algorithm using accurately\ncalculated pairwise SCC values, for n>9. We propose a similarity function that\ncan be used in the proposed search algorithm to quickly find a set of\npermutations with SCC values close to the minimum one. We evaluated our\napproach for several applications. The results show that, compared to prior\nwork, it achieves lower MSE with the same (or even lower) area. Additionally,\nbased on simulation results, we show that replacing the comparator component of\nan SNG circuit with a weighted binary generator can reduce SCC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jan 2020 20:25:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-08"}

This study focuses on the\nmodelling of functioning data from a 32 kWe dish-Stirling solar plant installed\nat a facility test site on the University of Palermo campus, in Southern Italy.\nThe proposed model, based on real monitored data, the energy balance of the\ncollector and the partial load efficiency of the Stirling engine, can be used\neasily to simulate the annual energy production of such systems, making use of\nthe solar radiation database, with the aim of encouraging a greater\ncommercialisation of this technology. Introducing further simplifying\nassumptions based on our experimental data, the model can be linearised\nproviding a new analytical expression of the parameters that characterise the\nwidely used Stine empirical model. The model was calibrated against data\ncorresponding to the collector with clean mirrors and used to predict the net\nelectric production of the dish-Stirling accurately. A numerical method for\nassessing the daily level of mirror soiling without the use of direct\nreflectivity measures was also defined. The proposed methodology was used to\nevaluate the history of mirror soiling for the observation period, which shows\na strong correlation with the recorded sequence of rains and dust depositions.\nThe results of this study emphasise how desert dust transport events, frequent\noccurrences in parts of the Mediterranean, can have a dramatic impact on the\nelectric power generation of dish-Stirling plants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 3 Jan 2020 21:00:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-02-18"}
