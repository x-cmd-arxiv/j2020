We present this algorithm\nusing the 4-metre Multi-Object Spectroscopic Telescope (4MOST) as an example.\n  Methods. The key idea of the proposed algorithm is to assign probabilities to\nfibre-target pairs. The assignment of probabilities takes the fibre\npositioner's capabilities and constraints into account. Additionally, these\nprobabilities include requirements from surveys and take the required exposure\ntime, number density variation, and angular clustering of targets across each\nsurvey into account. The main advantage of a probabilistic approach is that it\nallows for accurate and easy computation of the target selection function for\nthe different surveys, which involves determining the probability of observing\na target, given an input catalogue.\n  Results. The probabilistic fibre-to-target assignment allows us to achieve\nmaximally uniform completeness within a single field of view. The proposed\nalgorithm maximises the fraction of successfully observed targets whilst\nminimising the selection bias as a function of exposure time. In the case of\nseveral concurrent surveys, the algorithm maximally satisfies the scientific\nrequirements of each survey and no specific survey is penalised or prioritised.\n  Conclusions.

This problem is well-studied\nfor propositional but much less for first-order KBs.

We start with a novel knowledge\nevolution framework and natural postulates that evolution should respect, and\ncompare our postulates to the well-established AGM postulates. We then review\nwell-known model and formula-based approaches for expansion and contraction for\npropositional theories and show how they can be adapted to the case of DL-Lite.\nIn particular, we show intrinsic limitations of model-based approaches: besides\nthe fact that some of them do not respect the postulates we have established,\nthey ignore the structural properties of KBs. This leads to undesired\nproperties of evolution results: evolution of DL-Lite KBs cannot be captured in\nDL-Lite. Moreover, we show that well-known formula-based approaches are also\nnot appropriate for DL-Lite expansion and contraction: they either have a high\ncomplexity of computation, or they produce logical theories that cannot be\nexpressed in DL-Lite. Thus, we propose a novel formula-based approach that\nrespects our principles and for which evolution is expressible in DL-Lite.

Here,\nwe extend this problem to the random graph $\\mathbb{G}(n,p)$. We seek the\nalternating connectivity, $\\kappa_{r,\\ell}(G)$, which is the maximum $t$ such\nthat there is an $r$-edge-coloring of $G$ such that any pair of vertices is\nconnected by $t$ internally disjoint and alternating (i.e. no consecutive edges\nof the same color) paths of length $\\ell$. We have three main results about how\nthis parameter behaves in $\\mathbb{G}(n,p)$ that basically cover all ranges of\n$p$: one for paths of length two, one for the dense case, and one for the\nsparse case. For paths of length two, we found that $\\kappa_{r,\\ell}(G)$ is\nessentially the codegree of a pair of vertices. For the dense case when $p$ is\nconstant, we were able to achieve the natural upper bounds of minimum degree\n(minus some intersection) or the total number of disjoint paths between a pair\nof vertices. For the sparse case, we were able to find colorings that achieved\nthe natural obstructions of minimum degree or (in a slightly less precise\nresult) the total number of paths of a certain length in a graph. We broke up\nthis sparse case into ranges of $p$ corresponding to when $\\mathbb{G}(n,p)$ has\ndiameter $k$ or $k+1$. We close with some remarks about a similar parameter and\na generalization to pseudorandom graphs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Jan 2020 22:51:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-28"}

A key\nchallenge for online dating platforms is to determine suitable matches for\ntheir users. A lot of dating services rely on self-reported user traits and\npreferences for matching. At the same time, some services largely rely on user\nimages and thus initial visual preference. Especially for the latter approach,\nprevious research has attempted to capture users' visual preferences for\nautomatic match recommendation. These approaches are mostly based on the\nassumption that physical attraction is the key factor for relationship\nformation and personal preferences, interests, and attitude are largely\nneglected. Deep learning approaches have shown that a variety of properties can\nbe predicted from human faces to some degree, including age, health and even\npersonality traits. Therefore, we investigate the feasibility of bridging\nimage-based matching and matching with personal interests, preferences, and\nattitude. We approach the problem in a supervised manner by predicting\nsimilarity scores between two users based on images of their faces only. The\nground-truth for the similarity matching scores is determined by a test that\naims to capture users' preferences, interests, and attitude that are relevant\nfor forming romantic relationships. The images are processed by a Siamese\nMulti-Task deep learning architecture. We find a statistically significant\ncorrelation between predicted and target similarity scores. Thus, our results\nindicate that learning similarities in terms of interests, preferences, and\nattitude from face images appears to be feasible to some degree.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 25 Jan 2020 23:08:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-28"}

While this suppression comes at a cost\nby way of reduction in total energy confinement, that reduction is lower than\nthe reduction in MLE size.

Grouping articles that are reporting the\nsame event into news stories is a common way of assisting readers in their news\nconsumption. However, it remains a challenging research problem to efficiently\nand effectively generate a representative headline for each story. Automatic\nsummarization of a document set has been studied for decades, while few studies\nhave focused on generating representative headlines for a set of articles.\nUnlike summaries, which aim to capture most information with least redundancy,\nheadlines aim to capture information jointly shared by the story articles in\nshort length, and exclude information that is too specific to each individual\narticle. In this work, we study the problem of generating representative\nheadlines for news stories. We develop a distant supervision approach to train\nlarge-scale generation models without any human annotation. This approach\ncenters on two technical components. First, we propose a multi-level\npre-training framework that incorporates massive unlabeled corpus with\ndifferent quality-vs.-quantity balance at different levels. We show that models\ntrained within this framework outperform those trained with pure human curated\ncorpus.

This may\nbe understood as an alternative approach to risk reduction in a portfolio based\non a new mathematical quantity. First, we apply recently introduced\nsemi-metrics between finite sets to determine the distance between time series'\nstructural breaks. Then, we build on the classical portfolio optimization\ntheory of Markowitz and use this distance between asset structural breaks for\nour penalty function, rather than portfolio variance. Our experiments are\npromising: on synthetic data, we show that our proposed method does indeed\ndiversify among time series with highly similar structural breaks and enjoys\nadvantages over existing metrics between sets.

User Equipment (UE)-based prediction approaches that rely on passive\nmeasurements of network quality indicators have successfully been applied to\nforecast the throughput of vehicular data transmissions. However, the\nachievable prediction accuracy is limited as the UE is unaware of the current\nnetwork load. To overcome this issue, we propose a cooperative data rate\nprediction approach which brings together knowledge from the client and network\ndomains.

In the framework,\nthe topological amplitudes are expressed in invariant tensors and classified\ninto tree- and penguin-operator-induced diagrams according to which four-quark\noperators, tree or penguin, being inserted into their effective weak vertexes.\nBy decomposing the four-quark operators into irreducible representations of\n$SU(N)$ group, one can derive the $SU(N)$ irreducible amplitudes from the\ntensor form of the topology. Taking the $D\\to PP$ decay ($P$ denoting a\npseudoscalar meson) with $SU(3)_F$ symmetry as an example, we show our\nframework in detail. The fact that some topologies are not independent in the\n$SU(3)_F$ limit is explained by group theory. It is found that there are only\nnine independent topologies in all tree- and penguin-operator-induced diagrams\ncontributing to the $D\\to PP$ decays in the Standard Model. If a large\nquark-loop diagram is assumed, the large $\\Delta A_{CP}$ and the very different\n$D^0\\to K^+K^-$ and $D^0\\to \\pi^+\\pi^-$ branching fractions can be explained\nwith a normal $U$-spin breaking. Moreover, our framework provides a simple and\nsystematic way to analyze the $SU(N)$ breaking effects. As examples, the linear\n$SU(3)_F$ breaking and the high order $U$-spin breaking in charm decays are\nre-investigated in our framework, which are consistent with literature. We\npropose the concepts of splitting and degeneracy of topologies, and use them to\ndescribe the charm-less bottom decay. We find $SU(3)_F$ analysis for the\ncharm-less $B$ decays is different from the $D$ decays because the charm-quark\nloop is beyond the $SU(3)$ symmetry and should be investigated in the symmetry\nbreaking chain of $SU(4)\\to SU(3)$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Jan 2020 14:25:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 24 Sep 2021 01:34:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-27"}

However for dual source CT with flying focal spot (DS-FFS CT),\nstatistical iterative reconstruction that accurately models the scanner\ngeometry and physics remains unknown to researchers. Therefore, this paper\npresents a novel physics-based iterative reconstruction method for DS-FFS CT\nand assess its image quality. Our algorithm uses precise physics models to\nreconstruct from the native cone-beam geometry and interleaved dual source\nhelical trajectory of a DS-FFS CT. To do so, we construct a noise physics model\nto represent data acquisition noise and a prior image model to represent image\nnoise and texture. In addition, we design forward system models to compute the\nlocations of deflected focal spots, the dimension and sensitivity of voxels and\ndetector units, as well as the length of intersection between X-rays and\nvoxels. The forward system models further represent the coordinated movement\nbetween the dual sources by computing their X-ray coverage gaps and overlaps at\nan arbitrary helical pitch. With the above models, we reconstruct images by\nusing an advanced Consensus Equilibrium (CE) numerical method to compute the\nmaximum a posteriori estimate to a joint optimization problem that\nsimultaneously fits all models.

Credibility,\nalso referred as believability, is a quality perceived by individuals, who are\nnot always able to discern, with their own cognitive capacities, genuine\ninformation from fake one. Hence, in the last years, several approaches have\nbeen proposed to automatically assess credibility in social media. Many of them\nare based on data-driven models, i.e., they employ machine learning techniques\nto identify misinformation, but recently also model-driven approaches are\nemerging, as well as graph-based approaches focusing on credibility\npropagation, and knowledge-based ones exploiting Semantic Web technologies.\nThree of the main contexts in which the assessment of information credibility\nhas been investigated concern: (i) the detection of opinion spam in review\nsites, (ii) the detection of fake news in microblogging, and (iii) the\ncredibility assessment of online health-related information. In this article,\nthe main issues connected to the evaluation of information credibility in the\nSocial Web, which are shared by the above-mentioned contexts, are discussed.

However, retrieving a\nrequired image for an ordinary user is a challenging task in computer vision\nsystems. During the past two decades, many types of research have been\nintroduced to improve the performance of the automatic annotation of images,\nwhich are traditionally focused on content-based image retrieval. Although,\nrecent research demonstrates that there is a semantic gap between content-based\nimage retrieval and image semantics understandable by humans. As a result,\nexisting research in this area has caused to bridge the semantic gap between\nlow-level image features and high-level semantics. The conventional method of\nbridging the semantic gap is through the automatic image annotation (AIA) that\nextracts semantic features using machine learning techniques. In this paper, we\npropose a novel AIA model based on the deep learning feature extraction method.\nThe proposed model has three phases, including a feature extractor, a tag\ngenerator, and an image annotator. First, the proposed model extracts\nautomatically the high and low-level features based on dual-tree continues\nwavelet transform (DT-CWT), singular value decomposition, distribution of color\nton, and the deep neural network. Moreover, the tag generator balances the\ndictionary of the annotated keywords by a new log-entropy auto-encoder (LEAE)\nand then describes these keywords by word embedding. Finally, the annotator\nworks based on the long-short-term memory (LSTM) network in order to obtain the\nimportance degree of specific features of the image. The experiments conducted\non two benchmark datasets confirm that the superiority of the proposed model\ncompared to the previous models in terms of performance criteria.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 26 Jan 2020 05:59:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-01-30"}

In the present study, we added lateral inhibition to Multilink's lexical\nnetwork. Parameters were fit on the basis of reaction times from the English,\nBritish, and Dutch Lexicon Projects. We found a maximum correlation of 0.643\n(N=1,205) on these data sets as a whole. Furthermore, the simulations\nthemselves became faster as a result of adding lateral inhibition. We tested\nthe fitted model to stimuli from a neighbourhood study (Mulder et al., 2018).\nLateral inhibition was found to improve Multilink's correlations for this\nstudy, yielding an overall correlation of 0.67. Next, we explored the role of\nlateral inhibition as part of the model's task/decision system by running\nsimulations on data from two studies concerning interlingual homographs\n(Vanlangendonck et al., in press; Goertz, 2018). We found that, while lateral\ninhibition plays a substantial part in the word selection process, this alone\nis not enough to result in a correct response selection. To solve this problem,\nwe added a new task component to Multilink, especially designed to account for\nthe translation process of interlingual homographs, cognates, and\nlanguage-specific control words. The subsequent simulation results showed\npatterns remarkably similar to those in the Goertz study. The isomorphicity of\nthe simulated data to the empirical data was further attested by an overall\ncorrelation of 0.538 (N=254) between reaction times and simulated model cycle\ntimes, as well as a condition pattern correlation of 0.853 (N=8).
