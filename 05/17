To mitigate this\nchallenge, snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) was proposed to capture the\nhigh-dimensional (usually 3D) images using a 2D sensor (detector). Via novel\noptical design, the {\\em measurement} captured by the sensor is an encoded\nimage of multiple frames of the 3D desired signal. Following this,\nreconstruction algorithms are employed to retrieve the high-dimensional data.\nThough various algorithms have been proposed, the total variation (TV) based\nmethod is still the most efficient one due to a good trade-off between\ncomputational time and performance. This paper aims to answer the question of\nwhich TV penalty (anisotropic TV, isotropic TV and vectorized TV) works best\nfor video SCI reconstruction?

We also extend\nthe proposed exponential-inequality approach to the setting recently introduced\nby Steinke and Zakynthinou (2020), where the learning algorithm depends on a\nrandomly selected subset of the available training data. For this setup, we\npresent bounds for bounded loss functions in terms of the conditional\ninformation density between the output hypothesis and the random variable\ndetermining the subset choice, given all training data. Through our approach,\nwe recover the average generalization bound presented by Steinke and\nZakynthinou (2020) and extend it to the PAC-Bayesian and single-draw scenarios.\nFor the single-draw scenario, we also obtain novel bounds in terms of the\nconditional $\\alpha$-mutual information and the conditional maximal leakage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 May 2020 17:04:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Sep 2020 09:22:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 27 Nov 2020 21:50:21 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 2020 18:10:31 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Fri, 19 Mar 2021 09:12:12 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Thu, 9 Mar 2023 14:01:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-10"}

While the recent advances in deep\nlearning and the usage of deep neural networks have achieved near human\naccuracy on many tasks, there still exists a pretty big gap between human and\nmachine level performance when it comes to various visual relationship\ndetection tasks. Developing on earlier tasks like object recognition,\nsegmentation and captioning which focused on a relatively coarser image\nunderstanding, newer tasks have been introduced recently to deal with a finer\nlevel of image understanding. A Scene Graph is one such technique to better\nrepresent a scene and the various relationships present in it. With its wide\nnumber of applications in various tasks like Visual Question Answering,\nSemantic Image Retrieval, Image Generation, among many others, it has proved to\nbe a useful tool for deeper and better visual relationship understanding. In\nthis paper, we present a detailed survey on the various techniques for scene\ngraph generation, their efficacy to represent visual relationships and how it\nhas been used to solve various downstream tasks. We also attempt to analyze the\nvarious future directions in which the field might advance in the future.

These relations give a quantitative control of the effect of\nelementary and composite perturbations of the graph (deleting edges,\ncontracting vertices, etc.) on the spectrum of the corresponding Laplacians,\ngeneralising interlacing of eigenvalues.\n  We give several applications of the preorders: we show how to classify graphs\naccording to these preorders and we prove the stability of certain eigenvalues\nin graphs with a maximal d-clique. Moreover, we show the monotonicity of the\neigenvalues when passing to spanning subgraphs and the monotonicity of magnetic\nCheeger constants with respect to the geometric preorder. Finally, we prove a\nrefined procedure to detect spectral gaps in the spectrum of an infinite\ncovering graph.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 May 2020 19:59:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-11"}

Firstly, we generalize the traditional\nscalar PE, into a Tensor-PE, which gives rise to a family of new Systolic\nTensor Array (STA) microarchitectures. The STA family increases intra-PE\noperand reuse and datapath efficiency, resulting in circuit area and power\ndissipation reduction of as much as 2.08x and 1.36x respectively, compared to\nthe conventional SA at iso-throughput with INT8 operands. Secondly, we extend\nthis design to support a novel block-sparse data format called density-bound\nblock (DBB). This variant (STA-DBB) achieves a 3.14x and 1.97x improvement over\nthe SA baseline at iso-throughput in area and power respectively, when\nprocessing specially-trained DBB-sparse models, while remaining fully backwards\ncompatible with dense models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 May 2020 20:47:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-19"}

Existing reductions have largely been limited to inference\nproblems with similar structure -- primarily mapping among problems\nrepresentable as a sparse submatrix signal plus a noise matrix, which are\nsimilar to the common hardness assumption of planted clique.\n  The insight in this work is that a slight generalization of the planted\nclique conjecture -- secret leakage planted clique -- gives rise to a variety\nof new average-case reduction techniques, yielding a web of reductions among\nproblems with very different structure. Using variants of the planted clique\nconjecture for specific forms of secret leakage planted clique, we deduce tight\nstatistical-computational tradeoffs for a diverse range of problems including\nrobust sparse mean estimation, mixtures of sparse linear regressions, robust\nsparse linear regression, tensor PCA, variants of dense $k$-block stochastic\nblock models, negatively correlated sparse PCA, semirandom planted dense\nsubgraph, detection in hidden partition models and a universality principle for\nlearning sparse mixtures. In particular, a $k$-partite hypergraph variant of\nthe planted clique conjecture is sufficient to establish all of our\ncomputational lower bounds. Our techniques also reveal novel connections to\ncombinatorial designs and to random matrix theory.

Shaping of the pores also\ntransforms semimetallic graphene to semiconductor holey graphene, which opens\nnew door for its use in electronic applications. We systematically investigated\nthe structural, electronic, optical and thermoelectric properties of HG\nstructure using first-principles calculations. HG was found to have a direct\nband gap with 0.65 eV (PBE functional), 0.95 eV (HSE06 functional) and HSE06\nfunctional is in good agreement with experimental results. For the optical\nproperties, we use single-shot G0W0 calculations by solving the Bethe-Salpeter\nequation to determining the intralayer excitonic effects. From the absorption\nspectrum, we obtained the optical gap of 1.28 eV and a week excitonic binding\nenergy of 80 meV. We have found the large values of thermopower of 1662.59\n$\\mu$V/K and better electronic figure of merit, ZT$_{e}$ as 1.13 from the\ninvestigated thermoelectric properties.

Currently,\ntelerobotic assembly on an extraterrestrial body has never been attempted, and\na valid methodology to assess the associated human factors has not been\ndeveloped. The Telerobotics Laboratory at the University of Colorado-Boulder\ncreated the Telerobotic Simulation System (TSS) which enables remote operation\nof a rover and a robotic arm. The TSS was used in a laboratory experiment\ndesigned as an analog to a lunar mission. The operator's task was to assemble a\nradio interferometer. Each participant completed this task under two\nconditions, remote teleoperation (limited SA) and local operation (optimal SA).\nThe goal of the experiment was to establish a methodology to accurately measure\nthe operator's SA and CL while performing teleoperated assembly tasks. A\nsuccessful methodology would yield results showing greater SA and lower CL\nwhile operating locally. Performance metrics showed greater SA and lower CL in\nthe local environment, supported by a 27% increase in the mean time to\ncompletion of the assembly task when operating remotely.

Specifically, we consider\nsystems with the well-known l0-based RSE and two commonly used sound intrusion\ndetectors (IDs).

These results suggest that experimental training data\nas well as realistic quantum dot simulations and noise models are essential in\ncharge state detection using supervised machine learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 May 2020 23:41:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-19"}

While past\nstudies have established a comprehensive understanding of the impact on flat\nsubstrates, what we know about the impact dynamics on curved solid surfaces is\nstill limited. This work aims to elucidate the physics of droplet impact on\nspherical surfaces with different Weber numbers ($We$), radii ($R_s$), and\nsurface wettability ($\\theta^{eq}$) using a combination of axisymmetric lattice\nBoltzmann method (LBM) and theoretical analysis. The model developed in our\nprevious work [H. Dalgamoni and X. Yong, Phys. Rev.

The LBM simulations show\nthat $We$, $R_s$, and $\\theta^{eq}$ significantly affect the spreading and\nrecoiling of droplet during impact. The parametric studies uncover five\noutcomes of impact, which range from complete deposition to total rebound. A\nsimulation-predicted phase diagram was constructed and correlated with the\ntotal time that the droplet was in contact with the solid. In addition, a\ntheoretical model based on energy budget during impact was developed to predict\nthe rebound threshold for impact on spherical targets when varying We, and\nindependently, which agrees well with simulation observations. These findings\nprovide fundamental insight into surface structure design for controlling\ndroplet hydrodynamics and the contact time during impact.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 May 2020 23:53:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 May 2021 14:47:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-14"}

Our evaluation results demonstrate that it can predict the\npreference a user would have for a set of items as good as pure collaborative\nfiltering. This content-based algorithm is also embedded in a pure item-based\ncollaborative filtering algorithm to deal with the cold-start problem and\nenhance its accuracy.

Two approaches for loiter circle packing have been presented: square\nand hexagon packing, and the benefits of hexagon packing for minimizing the\nnumber of deployed UAVs have been shown. Based on the number of UAVs available\nand the desired loitering altitude, the proposed algorithm solves an\noptimization problem to calculate the centres of the loitering circles and the\nloitering radius for that altitude. The algorithm also incorporates fault\nrecovery capacity in case of simultaneous multiple UAV failures. These failures\ncould form clusters of survivor (active) UAVs over the area with no overall\nsurvivor information. The algorithm deploys a super-agent with a larger\ncommunication capacity at a higher altitude to recover from the failure. The\nsuper-agent collects the information of survivors, and updates the homogeneous\nradius and the locations of the loitering circles at the same altitude to\nrestore the full coverage. The individual survivor UAVs are then informed and\ntransit to the new loitering circles using Dubin's paths. The relationship with\nthe extent of recoverable loss fractions of the deployed UAVs have been\nanalysed for varying the initial loiter radii.

In this paper, we propose the first Generative\nAdversarial Networks (GANs) for enhancing facial attractiveness in both\ngeometry and appearance aspects, which we call \"FA-GANs\". FA-GANs contain two\nbranches and enhance facial attractiveness in two perspectives: facial geometry\nand facial appearance. Each branch consists of individual GANs with the\nappearance branch adjusting the facial image and the geometry branch adjusting\nthe facial landmarks in appearance and geometry aspects, respectively. Unlike\nthe traditional facial manipulations learning from paired faces, which are\ninfeasible to collect before and after enhancement of the same individual, we\nachieve this by learning the features of attractiveness faces through\nunsupervised adversarial learning. The proposed FA-GANs are able to extract\nattractiveness features and impose them on the enhancement results. To better\nenhance faces, both the geometry and appearance networks are considered to\nrefine the facial attractiveness by adjusting the geometry layout of faces and\nthe appearance of faces independently. To the best of our knowledge, we are the\nfirst to enhance the facial attractiveness with GANs in both geometry and\nappearance aspects. The experimental results suggest that our FA-GANs can\ngenerate compelling perceptual results in both geometry structure and facial\nappearance and outperform current state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 May 2020 05:02:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 6 Jun 2020 00:58:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-09"}

Only those IRDCs satisfying a certain mass-size\ncriterion, or equivalently above a certain threshold density, are found to\ncontain HMYSOs. In all cases, IRDCs provide ideal conditions for the formation\nof stellar clusters. In this paper, we study the massive stellar content of\nIRDCs to re-address the relation between IRDCs and HM star formation. For this\npurpose, we have identified all IRDCs associated to a sample of 12 Galactic\nmolecular clouds (MCs). The selected MCs have been the target of a systematic\nsearch for YSOs in an earlier study. The catalogued positions of YSOs have been\nused to search all YSOs embedded in each identified IRDC. In total, we have\nfound 834 YSOs in 128 IRDCs. The sample of IRDCs have mean surface densities of\n319 Mo/pc2, mean mass of 1062 Mo, and a mass function power-law slope -1.8,\nwhich are similar to the corresponding properties for the full sample of IRDCs\nand resulting physical properties in previous studies.

Branch predictors record history about the execution of\ndifferent programs, and such information from different processes are stored in\nthe same structure and thus accessible to each other. This leaves the attackers\nwith the opportunities for malicious training and malicious perception. Instead\nof flush-based or physical isolation of hardware resources, we want to achieve\nisolation of the content in these hardware tables with some lightweight\nprocessing using randomization as follows.

We propose to\nuse hardware-based thread-private random numbers to encode the contents of the\nbranch predictor tables (both direction and destination histories) which we\ncall XOR-BP. Specifically, the data is encoded by XOR operation with the key\nbefore written in the table and decoded after read from the table.

Similar to the XOR-BP, another thread-private random number is\nused together with the branch instruction address as the input to compute the\nindex of the branch predictor.

This is done by directly combining the\nresults of models and feeding it back, together with the result of the DNN\nmodel, to update the GMM model. Besides, a control scheme is elaborately\ndesigned to detect the endpoints of speech. The superior performance by\nemploying this scheme is validated through experiments in practical, which give\nan insight into the advantage of combining supervised learning and unsupervised\nlearning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 May 2020 08:01:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-19"}

The first edge closing is well-described by a\nfirst-passage process in 2D, with a characteristic time that decays with the\nnumber of faces. By contrast, the subsequent edge closings are all\nfirst-passage processes in 1D and so the time of the last one grows\nlogarithmically with the number of faces. It is the interplay between these two\ndifferent sets of events that explains the non-monotonic behavior.

Here, it is important - yet challenging - to perform well on novel\n(zero-shot) or rare (few-shot) compositions of objects and relationships.

This leads to the neglect of individual edges in large\nsparse graphs during training, even though these contain diverse few-shot\nexamples that are important for generalization. Secondly, the frequency of\nrelationships can create a strong bias in this task, such that a blind model\npredicting the most frequent relationship achieves good performance.\nConsequently, some state-of-the-art models exploit this bias to improve\nresults. We show that such models can suffer the most in their ability to\ngeneralize to rare compositions, evaluating two different models on the Visual\nGenome dataset and its more recent, improved version, GQA. To address these\nissues, we introduce a density-normalized edge loss, which provides more than a\ntwo-fold improvement in certain generalization metrics.

Using Floquet theory we show how the quantum Langevin equations\nfor the fluctuations can be efficiently integrated by partitioning the time\ndomain into one-period duration intervals, and relating the properties of each\nperiod to the first one. Spectral densities, like squeezing spectra, are\ncomputed similarly, now in a two-dimensional temporal domain that is treated as\na chessboard with one-period x one-period cells. This technique avoids\ncumulative numerical errors as well as efficiently saves computational time.

The exploitation of these resources for tackling\nthe semantic gap issue has been widely studied in the literature.

Among these challenges is the insufficient knowledge individually\nencoded in existing medical ontologies, which is magnified when users express\ntheir information needs using long-winded natural language queries. In this\ncontext, many of the users query terms are either unrecognized by the used\nontologies, or cause retrieving false positives that degrade the quality of\ncurrent medical information search approaches.

Due to the existed financial loss, there is a pressing need to\nperform timely investigation and detect more attack instances. Though multiple\nsystems have been proposed, they suffer from the scalability issue due to the\nfollowing reasons. First, the tight coupling between malicious contract\ndetection and blockchain data importing makes them infeasible to repeatedly\ndetect different attacks. Second, the coarse-grained archive data makes them\ninefficient to replay transactions. Third, the separation between malicious\ncontract detection and runtime state recovery consumes lots of storage.\n  In this paper, we present the design of a scalable attack detection framework\non Ethereum. It overcomes the scalability issue by saving the Ethereum state\ninto a database and providing an efficient way to locate suspicious\ntransactions. The saved state is fine-grained to support the replay of\narbitrary transactions. The state is well-designed to avoid saving unnecessary\nstate to optimize the storage consumption. We implement a prototype named\nEthScope and solve three technical challenges, i.e., incomplete Ethereum state,\nscalability, and extensibility. The performance evaluation shows that our\nsystem can solve the scalability issue, i.e., efficiently performing a\nlarge-scale analysis on billions of transactions, and a speedup of around\n2,300x when replaying transactions. It also has lower storage consumption\ncompared with existing systems. The result with three different types of\ninformation as inputs shows that our system can help an analyst understand\nattack behaviors and further detect more attacks. To engage the community, we\nwill release our system and the dataset of detected attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 May 2020 15:23:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Oct 2020 13:24:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-26"}

We say that a graph $\\mathcal{G}$ is navigable when an agent is able to\nefficiently reach any target node in $\\mathcal{G}$ by means of local routing\ndecisions. In a social network navigability translates to the ability of\nreaching an individual through personal contacts. Graph navigability is\nwell-studied, but a fundamental question is still open: why are some\nindividuals more likely than others to be reached via short,\nfriend-of-a-friend, communication chains? In this article we answer the\nquestion above by proposing a novel centrality metric called the potential\ngain, which, in an informal sense, quantifies the easiness at which a target\nnode can be reached. We define two variants of the potential gain, called the\ngeometric and the exponential potential gain, and present fast algorithms to\ncompute them. The geometric and the potential gain are the first instances of a\nnovel class of composite centrality metrics, i.e., centrality metrics which\ncombine the popularity of a node in $\\mathcal{G}$ with its similarity to all\nother nodes. As shown in previous studies, popularity and similarity are two\nmain criteria which regulate the way humans seek for information in large\nnetworks such as Wikipedia. We give a formal proof that the potential gain of a\nnode is always equivalent to the product of its degree centrality (which\ncaptures popularity) and its Katz centrality (which captures similarity).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 May 2020 13:17:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-20"}

Regarding the physical things that are related to the\ninternet, it is worth noting that considering numerous theories and upcoming\npredictions, they mostly require protected structures, moreover, they are at\nrisk of several attacks. IoTs are endowed with particular routing disobedience\ncalled sinkhole attack owing to their distributed features. In these attacks, a\nmalicious node broadcasts illusive information regarding the routings to impose\nitself as a route towards specific nodes for the neighboring nodes and thus,\nattract data traffic. RPL (IP-V6 routing protocol for efficient and low-energy\nnetworks) is a standard routing protocol which is mainly employed in sensor\nnetworks and IoT. This protocol is called SoS-RPL consisting of two key\nsections of the sinkhole detection. In the first section rating and ranking the\nnodes in the RPL is carried out based on distance measurements. The second\nsection is in charge of discovering the misbehavior sources within the IoT\nnetwork through, the Average Packet Transmission RREQ (APT-RREQ). Here, the\ntechnique is assessed through wide simulations performed within the NS-3\nenvironment.

This class of\nmodels can estimate both the effect of individual characteristics as well as\nthe network effect, or social influence, on some actor attribute of interest.\nCollecting data on the entire network, however, is very often infeasible or\nimpossible if the network boundary is unknown or difficult to define. Obtaining\negocentric network data overcomes these obstacles, but as of yet there has been\nno clear way to model this type of data and still appropriately capture the\nnetwork effect on the actor attributes in a way that is compatible with a joint\ndistribution on the full network data. This paper adapts the class of network\nautocorrelation models to handle egocentric data. The proposed methods thus\nincorporate the complex dependence structure of the data induced by the network\nrather than simply using ad hoc measures of the egos' networks to model the\nmean structure, and can estimate the network effect on the actor attribute of\ninterest. The vast quantities of unknown information about the network can be\nsuccinctly represented in such a way that only depends on the number of alters\nin the egocentric network data and not on the total number of actors in the\nnetwork.

A simulation study is\nperformed to evaluate the estimation performance, and an egocentric data set is\nanalyzed where the aim is to determine if there is a network effect on\nenvironmental mastery, an important aspect of psychological well-being.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 May 2020 15:26:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-20"}

This assumption can be quite strong and is sometimes\ndifficult to justify. If time steps are rather large, one would typically\nexpect not only the existence of temporal dependencies among the dyads across\nobserved time points but also the existence of simultaneous dependencies\naffecting how the dyads of the network co-evolve.

The auxiliary predictive tasks in existing\npretraining approaches are mostly defined on tokens, thus may not be able to\ncapture sentence-level semantics very well. To address this issue, we propose\nCERT: Contrastive self-supervised Encoder Representations from Transformers,\nwhich pretrains language representation models using contrastive\nself-supervised learning at the sentence level. CERT creates augmentations of\noriginal sentences using back-translation. Then it finetunes a pretrained\nlanguage encoder (e.g., BERT) by predicting whether two augmented sentences\noriginate from the same sentence. CERT is simple to use and can be flexibly\nplugged into any pretraining-finetuning NLP pipeline. We evaluate CERT on 11\nnatural language understanding tasks in the GLUE benchmark where CERT\noutperforms BERT on 7 tasks, achieves the same performance as BERT on 2 tasks,\nand performs worse than BERT on 2 tasks. On the averaged score of the 11 tasks,\nCERT outperforms BERT.

One promising route is to exploit the\nmolecular graph structure through Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). It is well\nknown that both atoms and bonds significantly affect the chemical properties of\na molecule, so an expressive model shall be able to exploit both node (atom)\nand edge (bond) information simultaneously. Guided by this observation, we\npresent Multi-View Graph Neural Network (MV-GNN), a multi-view message passing\narchitecture to enable more accurate predictions of molecular properties. In\nMV-GNN, we introduce a shared self-attentive readout component and disagreement\nloss to stabilize the training process. This readout component also renders the\nwhole architecture interpretable. We further boost the expressive power of\nMV-GNN by proposing a cross-dependent message passing scheme that enhances\ninformation communication of the two views, which results in the MV-GNN^cross\nvariant. Lastly, we theoretically justify the expressiveness of the two\nproposed models in terms of distinguishing non-isomorphism graphs. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that MV-GNN models achieve remarkably superior\nperformance over the state-of-the-art models on a variety of challenging\nbenchmarks. Meanwhile, visualization results of the node importance are\nconsistent with prior knowledge, which confirms the interpretability power of\nMV-GNN models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 May 2020 04:46:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 May 2020 08:57:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2020 06:09:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-15"}

These SNNs can be implemented with extreme energy\nefficiency on neuromorphic processors like the Intel Loihi research chip, and\nfed by event-based sensors, such as DVS cameras. However, DNNs with many layers\ncan achieve relatively high accuracy on image classification and recognition\ntasks, as the research on learning rules for SNNs for real-world applications\nis still not mature. The accuracy results for SNNs are typically obtained\neither by converting the trained DNNs into SNNs, or by directly designing and\ntraining SNNs in the spiking domain. Towards the conversion from a DNN to an\nSNN, we perform a comprehensive analysis of such process, specifically designed\nfor Intel Loihi, showing our methodology for the design of an SNN that achieves\nnearly the same accuracy results as its corresponding DNN.
