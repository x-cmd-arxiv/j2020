First, we show that with the true gradient,\npolicy gradient with a softmax parametrization converges at a $O(1/t)$ rate,\nwith constants depending on the problem and initialization.

The analysis\nrelies on two findings: that the softmax policy gradient satisfies a\n\\L{}ojasiewicz inequality, and the minimum probability of an optimal action\nduring optimization can be bounded in terms of its initial value. Second, we\nanalyze entropy regularized policy gradient and show that it enjoys a\nsignificantly faster linear convergence rate $O(e^{-c \\cdot t})$ toward softmax\noptimal policy $(c > 0)$. This result resolves an open question in the recent\nliterature. Finally, combining the above two results and additional new\n$\\Omega(1/t)$ lower bound results, we explain how entropy regularization\nimproves policy optimization, even with the true gradient, from the perspective\nof convergence rate. The separation of rates is further explained using the\nnotion of non-uniform \\L{}ojasiewicz degree.

A packrat parser uses memoization to reduce the time complexity for\nrecursive descent parsing from exponential to linear in the length of the\ninput. Recursive descent parsers are extremely simple to write, but suffer from\ntwo significant problems: (i) left-recursive grammars cause the parser to get\nstuck in infinite recursion, and (ii) it can be difficult or impossible to\noptimally recover the parse state and continue parsing after a syntax error.\nBoth problems are solved by the pika parser, a novel reformulation of packrat\nparsing as a dynamic programming algorithm, which requires parsing the input in\nreverse: bottom-up and right to left, rather than top-down and left to right.\nThis reversed parsing order enables pika parsers to handle grammars that use\neither direct or indirect left recursion to achieve left associativity,\nsimplifying grammar writing, and also enables optimal recovery from syntax\nerrors, which is a crucial property for IDEs and compilers. Pika parsing\nmaintains the linear-time performance characteristics of packrat parsing as a\nfunction of input length. The pika parser was benchmarked against the\nwidely-used Parboiled2 and ANTLR4 parsing libraries. The pika parser performed\nsignificantly better than the other parsers for an expression grammar, although\nfor a complex grammar implementing the Java language specification, a large\nconstant performance impact was incurred per input character. Therefore, if\nperformance is important, pika parsing is best applied to simple to\nmoderate-sized grammars, or to very large inputs, if other parsing alternatives\ndo not scale linearly in the length of the input.

In both\ncases, we apply, for a short initial time interval, monochromatic forcing at a\ncertain wave number so that the correlation length is finite, but much smaller\nthan the typical length scale of turbulence. In particular, we investigate the\ndecay of nonhelical and helical hydromagnetic turbulence. We show that, in the\npresence of a homogeneous magnetic field, the decay of helical and nonhelical\nsmall-scale fields can occur rapidly. This is a special property of a system\nwith a perfectly homogeneous magnetic field, which is sometimes considered as a\nlocal approximation to a slowly varying background field. It can never change\nand acts as an imposed magnetic field. This is in a sharp contrast to the case\nof a statistically homogeneous magnetic field, where we recover familiar decay\nproperties: a much slower decay of magnetic energy and a faster growth of the\ncorrelation length, especially in the case with magnetic felicity. The result\nsuggests that a homogeneous magnetic field, if generated during inflation,\nshould persist under the influence of small-scale fields and could be the\norigin of the large-scale magnetic field in the Universe.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 May 2020 17:46:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Jul 2020 03:29:03 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 25 Jul 2020 18:06:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-28"}

Examples range from novel phases of matter in both\nquantum and classical many-body systems, to galaxy formation or neural\ndynamics. Two characteristic phenomena are length scales that exceed the\ncharacteristic interaction length and spontaneous symmetry breaking. Recent\nadvances in integrated photonics indicate that the study of emergent phenomena\nis possible in complex coupled nonlinear optical systems. Here we demonstrate\nthat out-of-equilibrium driving of a strongly coupled (\"dimer\") pair of\nphotonic integrated Kerr microresonators, which at the \"single-particle\" (i.e.\nindividual resonator) level generate well understood dissipative Kerr solitons,\nexhibit emergent nonlinear phenomena. By exploring the dimer phase diagram, we\nfind unexpected and therefore unpredicted regimes of soliton hopping,\nspontaneous symmetry breaking, and periodically emerging (in)commensurate\ndispersive waves.

The topological\nobstruction lies in a bordism group and, surprisingly, it can disappear even\nfor a SUSY-compatible spin structure. As a proof of principle, we construct an\nexplicit bubble of nothing for a $T^3$ with completely periodic\n(SUSY-compatible) spin structure in an Einstein dilaton Gauss-Bonnet theory,\nwhich arises in the low-energy limit of certain heterotic and type II flux\ncompactifications.

Equivalence classes belonging to different gauges are not\nequivalent and the truncated phase-invariance principle does not provide an\nargument to prefer a particular class. In general, the optimal class depends on\nthe physical situation, including the observables, the parameter regime, and\nthe number of field modes being considered.

I propose here that photosynthesis is nevertheless thermodynamically\nlimited, but this limit acts indirectly on the material exchange of water and\ncarbon dioxide. I substantiate this interpretation using global\nobservation-based datasets of radiation, photosynthesis, precipitation and\nevaporation. I first calculate the conversion efficiency of photosynthesis in\nterrestrial ecosystems and its climatological variation, with a median\nefficiency of 0.78% (n = 13445). The rates tightly correlate with evaporation\n(r2 = 0.89), which demonstrates the importance of the coupling of\nphotosynthesis to material exchange. I then infer evaporation from the maximum\nmaterial exchange between the surface and the atmosphere that is\nthermodynamically possible using datasets of solar radiation and precipitation.\nThis inferred rate closely correlates with the observation-based evaporation\ndataset (r2 = 0.85). When this rate is converted back into photosynthetic\nactivity, the resulting patterns correlate highly with the observation-based\ndataset (r2 = 0.56). This supports the interpretation that it is not energy\ndirectly that limits terrestrial photosynthesis, but rather the material\nexchange that is driven by sunlight. This interpretation can explain the very\nlow, observed conversion efficiency of photosynthesis in terrestrial ecosystems\nas well as its spatial variations. More generally, this implies that one needs\nto take the necessary material flows and exchanges associated with life into\naccount to understand the thermodynamics of life. This, ultimately, requires a\nperspective that links the activity of the biosphere to the thermodynamic\nconstraints of transport processes in the Earth system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 May 2020 19:00:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 08:42:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 15 Sep 2020 08:37:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-18"}

Our TS-RCN can be\nintegrated with existing deep learning based visual trackers.

In\nthe former case cosmological parameter inference is accelerated by a factor of\n$\\sim 10$-$30$ compared to explicit calls to the Boltzmann solver CLASS when\napplied to KiDS-450 weak lensing data. Much larger gains will come with future\ndata, where with MOPED compression, the speed up can be up to a factor of $\\sim\n10^3$ when the common Limber approximation is used. Furthermore, the GP opens\nup the possibility of dropping the Limber approximation, without which the\ntheoretical calculations may be unfeasibly slow. A potential advantage of GPs\nis that an error on the emulated function can be computed and this uncertainty\nincorporated into the likelihood. If speed is of the essence, then the mean of\nthe Gaussian Process can be used and the uncertainty ignored. We compute the\nKullback-Leibler divergence between the emulator likelihood and the CLASS\nlikelihood, and on the basis of this and from analysing the uncertainties on\nthe parameters, we find that in this case, the inclusion of the GP uncertainty\ndoes not justify the extra computational expense in the test application. For\nfuture weak lensing surveys such as Euclid and Legacy Survey of Space and\nTelescope (LSST), the number of summary statistics will be large, up to $\\sim\n10^{4}$. The speed of MOPED is determined by the number of parameters, not the\nnumber of summary data, so the gains are very large. In the non-Limber case,\nthe speed-up can be a factor of $\\sim 10^5$, provided that a fast way to\ncompute the theoretical MOPED coefficients is available.

However, some governments are allegedly manipulating social\nmedia by hiring online commentators (also known as trolls) to spread propaganda\nand disinformation. In particular, an alleged system of professional trolls\noperating both domestically and internationally exists in Russia. In 2018,\nTwitter released data on accounts identified as Russian trolls, starting a wave\nof research. However, while foreign-targeted English language operations of\nthese trolls have received significant attention, no research has analyzed\ntheir Russian language domestic and regional-targeted activities. We address\nthis gap by characterizing the Russian-language operations of Russian trolls.\nWe first perform a descriptive analysis, and then focus in on the trolls'\noperation related to the crash of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17.\n  Among other things, we find that Russian-language trolls have run 163 hashtag\ncampaigns (where hashtag use grows abruptly within a month). The main political\nsentiments of such campaigns were praising Russia and Putin (29%), criticizing\nUkraine (26%), and criticizing the United States and Obama (9%). Further,\ntrolls actively reshared information with 76% of tweets being retweets or\ncontaining a URL. Additionally, we observe periodic temporal patterns of\ntweeting suggesting that trolls use automation tools. Further, we find that\ntrolls' information campaign on the MH17 crash was the largest in terms of\ntweet count. However, around 68% of tweets posted with MH17 hashtags were\nlikely used simply for hashtag amplification. With these tweets excluded, about\n49% of the tweets suggested to varying levels that Ukraine was responsible for\nthe crash, and only 13% contained disinformation and propaganda presented as\nnews.

In the case of\nnoncentrosymmetric materials, these phases are separated by a gapless Weyl\nsemimetal phase. However, at finite temperature, the gap is affected by atomic\nmotion, through electron-phonon interaction, and by thermal expansion of the\nlattice. As a consequence, the phase space of topologically nontrivial phases\nis affected by temperature. In this paper, the pressure and temperature\ndependence of the indirect band gap of BiTeI is investigated from first\nprinciples. We evaluate the contribution from both electron-phonon interaction\nand thermal expansion, and show that their combined effect drives the\ntopological phase transition towards higher pressures with increasing\ntemperature.

We show, via extensive empirical evaluations,\nthat the proposed algorithm achieves a higher prediction accuracy compared to\nalternative recurrent network architectures. We conduct experiments to\ninvestigate the impact of the length of observation, time to event and types of\nfeatures on the performance of the proposed method. Finally, we demonstrate how\ndifferent data fusion strategies impact prediction accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 May 2020 20:59:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-15"}

Compatibility is the key factor in creating stylish outfits\nfrom single items. Previous studies have mostly focused on modeling pair-wise\ncompatibility.

Similar to\ncomputer vision problems, such as object detection, Action Image builds on the\nidea that object features are invariant to translation in image space.\nTherefore, grasp quality is invariant when evaluating the object-gripper\nrelationship; a successful grasp for an object depends on its local context,\nbut is independent of the surrounding environment.

A prominent\napproach to pragmatics is the Rational Speech Act (RSA) framework, which\nformulates pragmatic reasoning as probabilistic speakers and listeners\nrecursively reasoning about each other. While RSA enjoys broad empirical\nsupport, it is not yet clear whether the dynamics of such recursive reasoning\nmay be governed by a general optimization principle. Here, we present a novel\nanalysis of the RSA framework that addresses this question. First, we show that\nRSA recursion implements an alternating maximization for optimizing a tradeoff\nbetween expected utility and communicative effort. On that basis, we study the\ndynamics of RSA recursion and disconfirm the conjecture that expected utility\nis guaranteed to improve with recursion depth. Second, we show that RSA can be\ngrounded in Rate-Distortion theory, while maintaining a similar ability to\naccount for human behavior and avoiding a bias of RSA toward random utterance\nproduction. This work furthers the mathematical understanding of RSA models,\nand suggests that general information-theoretic principles may give rise to\nhuman pragmatic reasoning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 May 2020 22:04:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-15"}

Recent works have\nshown that the solar magnetic field may play a crucial role in collimating the\nplasma in the heliosheath. Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) observations\nof the heliotail indicated a latitudinal structure varying with energy in the\nenergetic neutral atom (ENA) fluxes. At energies ~1 keV, the ENA fluxes show an\nenhancement at low latitudes and a deficit of ENAs near the poles. At energies\n>2.7 keV, ENA fluxes had a deficit within low latitudes, and lobes of higher\nENA flux near the poles. This ENA structure was initially interpreted to be a\nresult of the latitudinal profile of the solar wind during solar minimum. We\nextend the work of Kornbleuth et al. (2018) by using solar minimum-like\nconditions and the recently developed SHIELD model. The SHIELD model couples\nthe magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) plasma solution with a kinetic description of\nneutral hydrogen. We show that while the latitudinal profile of the solar wind\nduring solar minimum contributes to the lobes in ENA maps, the collimation by\nthe solar magnetic field is important in creating and shaping the two high\nlatitude lobes of enhanced ENA flux observed by IBEX. This is the first work to\nexplore the effect of the changing solar magnetic field strength on ENA maps.\nOur findings suggest that IBEX is providing the first observational evidence of\nthe collimation of the heliosheath plasma by the solar magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 May 2020 22:08:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-03"}

Toward this\nend, we created a system, called GenXGen[MC], that specializes stripped\nbinaries.\n  Many aspects of the debloating problem can be addressed via techniques from\nthe literature on partial evaluation. However, applying such techniques to\nreal-world programs, particularly stripped binaries, involves non-trivial\nstate-management manipulations that have never been addressed in a completely\nsatisfactory manner in previous systems. In particular, a partial evaluator\nneeds to be able to (i) save and restore arbitrary program states, and (ii)\ndetermine whether a program state is equal to one that arose earlier. Moreover,\nto specialize stripped binaries, the system must also be able to handle program\nstates consisting of memory that is undifferentiated beyond the standard coarse\ndivision into regions for the stack, the heap, and global data.\n  This paper presents a new approach to state management in a program\nspecializer.

The signature of the spin-triplet supercurrent is a\nrelatively slow decay of the maximum supercurrent as a function of the\nthickness of the middle ferromagnetic layer. In this work we focus on junctions\nwhere the middle magnetic layer is a [Co/Pd]$_N$ multilayer with perpendicular\nmagnetic anisotropy (PMA), while the outer two layers have in-plane anisotropy.\nWe compare junctions where the middle PMA layer is or is not configured as a\nsynthetic antiferromagnet (PMA-SAF). We find that the supercurrent decays much\nmore rapidly with increasing the number $N$ of [Co/Pd] bilayers in the PMA-SAF\njunctions compared to the PMA junctions. Similar behavior is observed in\njunctions containing [Co/Ni]$_N$ PMA multilayers. We model that behavior by\nassuming that each Co/Pd or Co/Ni interface acts as a partial spin filter, so\nthat the spin-triplet supercurrent in the PMA junctions becomes more strongly\nspin-polarized as $N$ increases while the supercurrent in the PMA-SAF junctions\nis suppressed with increasing $N$. We also address a question raised in a\nprevious work regarding how much spin-singlet supercurrent is transmitted\nthrough our nominally spin-triplet junctions. We do that by comparing\nspin-triplet junctions with similar junctions where the order of the magnetic\nlayers has been shuffled. The results of this work are expected to be helpful\nin designing spin-triplet Josephson junctions for use in cryogenic memory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 May 2020 23:02:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-29"}

For\nstochastic games, in general, such an ordering is not possible since additional\ninformation can lead to equilibria perturbations with positive or negative\nvalues to a player. However, for zero-sum games in a finite probability space,\nP\\k{e}ski introduced a complete characterization of ordering of information\nstructures. In this paper, we obtain an infinite dimensional (standard Borel)\ngeneralization of P\\k{e}ski's result. A corollary is that more information\ncannot hurt a decision maker taking part in a zero-sum game. We establish two\nsupporting results which are essential and explicit though modest improvements\non prior literature: (i) a partial converse to Blackwell's ordering in the\nstandard Borel setup and (ii) an existence result for equilibria in zero-sum\ngames with incomplete information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 May 2020 00:15:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 May 2020 20:08:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 5 Jan 2021 20:11:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-07"}

The algorithm\ndecomposes the time domain into a set of overlapping subdomains, and solves all\nsubproblems defined over subdomains in parallel. The convergence is attained by\nupdating primal-dual information at the boundaries of overlapping subdomains.\nWe show that the algorithm exhibits local linear convergence, and that the\nconvergence rate improves exponentially with the overlap size. We also\nestablish global convergence results for a general quadratic programming, which\nenables the application of the Schwarz scheme inside second-order optimization\nalgorithms (e.g., sequential quadratic programming). The theoretical foundation\nof our convergence analysis is a sensitivity result of nonlinear OCPs, which we\ncall \"exponential decay of sensitivity\" (EDS). Intuitively, EDS states that the\nimpact of perturbations at domain boundaries (i.e. initial and terminal time)\non the solution decays exponentially as one moves into the domain. Here, we\nexpand a previous analysis available in the literature by showing that EDS\nholds for both primal and dual solutions of nonlinear OCPs, under uniform\nsecond-order sufficient condition, controllability condition, and boundedness\ncondition. We conduct experiments with a quadrotor motion planning problem and\na PDE control problem to validate our theory; and show that the approach is\nsignificantly more efficient than ADMM and as efficient as the centralized\nsolver Ipopt.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 May 2020 00:19:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 May 2020 16:35:53 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 2 Jul 2020 14:57:19 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 2021 17:24:17 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 15 Mar 2022 01:43:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-16"}

This has\nmotivated the development of methods for interpreting such models, e.g., via\ngradient-based saliency maps or the visualization of attention weights. Such\napproaches aim to provide explanations for a particular model prediction by\nhighlighting important words in the corresponding input text. While this might\nbe useful for tasks where decisions are explicitly influenced by individual\ntokens in the input, we suspect that such highlighting is not suitable for\ntasks where model decisions should be driven by more complex reasoning. In this\nwork, we investigate the use of influence functions for NLP, providing an\nalternative approach to interpreting neural text classifiers. Influence\nfunctions explain the decisions of a model by identifying influential training\nexamples. Despite the promise of this approach, influence functions have not\nyet been extensively evaluated in the context of NLP, a gap addressed by this\nwork. We conduct a comparison between influence functions and common\nword-saliency methods on representative tasks. As suspected, we find that\ninfluence functions are particularly useful for natural language inference, a\ntask in which 'saliency maps' may not have clear interpretation. Furthermore,\nwe develop a new quantitative measure based on influence functions that can\nreveal artifacts in training data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 May 2020 00:45:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-15"}

To address\nthese issues, we propose Adaptive Multi-Trace Carving (AMTC), a unified\napproach for detecting and tracking one or more subtle frequency components\nunder very low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions and in near real time.\nAMTC takes as input a time-frequency representation of the system's\npreprocessing results (such as the spectrogram), and identifies frequency\ncomponents through iterative dynamic programming and adaptive trace\ncompensation.

The criteria take into account the inhomogeneity of the electric\nfield and the mutual influence of the electric field and the liquid-crystal\ndirector field on each other. The criteria show that formulas for the\ninstability thresholds of electric-field Freedericksz transitions cannot in all\ncases be obtained from those for the analogous magnetic-field transitions by\nsimply replacing the magnetic parameters by the corresponding electric\nparameters, contrary to claims in standard references. This finding is\nconsistent with [Arakelyan, Karayan, Chilingaryan, Sov. Phys. Dokl., 29 (1984)\n202-204].

However, this advancement is not evenly distributed\nover all languages. Urdu is among the languages which did not receive much\nattention, especially in the font independent perspective. There exists no\nautomated system that can reliably recognize printed Urdu text in images and\nvideos across different fonts. To help bridge this gap, we have developed\nQaida, a large scale data set with 256 fonts, and a complete Urdu lexicon. We\nhave also developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based classification\nmodel which can recognize Urdu ligatures with 84.2% accuracy. Moreover, we\ndemonstrate that our recognition network can not only recognize the text in the\nfonts it is trained on but can also reliably recognize text in unseen (new)\nfonts. To this end, this paper makes following contributions: (i) we introduce\na large scale, multiple fonts based data set for printed Urdu text\nrecognition;(ii) we have designed, trained and evaluated a CNN based model for\nUrdu text recognition; (iii) we experiment with incremental learning methods to\nproduce state-of-the-art results for Urdu text recognition.

Considering\nchannel estimation errors, we model both the AP-IRS channel and the\nAP-IRS-receiver as a cascaded channel by norm-based uncertainty sets.

Numerical results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of deploying an RIS and the superiority of the proposed\nblock-structured Riemannian pursuit method in terms of the achievable DoFs and\nthe achievable sum rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 May 2020 07:28:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-15"}

Since planet formation seems to start early, and\nmature disks are too cold for characteristic COM emission lines, studying the\ninventory of COMs on solar system scales in the Class 0/I stage is relevant.\nALMA Band 3 (3 mm) and Band 6 (1 mm) observations are obtained of seven Class 0\nprotostars in the Perseus and Serpens star-forming regions. By modeling the\ninner protostellar region using 'LTE' models, the excitation temperature and\ncolumn densities are determined for several O-bearing COMs. B1-c, B1-bS, and\nSerpens S68N show COM emission, i.e, three out of the seven sources. No clear\ncorrelation seems to exist between the occurrence of COMs and source\nluminosity. The abundances of several COMs with respect to CH3OH are remarkably\nsimilar for the three COM-rich sources, and to IRAS 16293-2422B and HH 212. For\nother COMs the abundances differ by up to an order of magnitude, indicating\nthat local source conditions are case determining. B1-c hosts a cold\n($T_{ex}\\approx60$ K), more extended component of COM emission with a column\ndensity of typically a few % of the warm/hot ($T_{ex}\\sim 200$ K), central\ncomponent. A D/H ratio of 1-3 % is derived based on the CH2DOH/CH3OH ratio\nsuggesting a temperature of $\\sim$15~K during the formation of methanol. This\nratio is consistent with other low-mass protostars. Future mid-infrared\nfacilities such as JWST/MIRI will be essential to directly observe COM ices.\nCombining this with a larger sample of COM-rich sources with ALMA will allow\nfor directly linking ice and gas-phase abundances in order to constrain the\nroutes that produce and maintain chemical complexity during the star formation\nprocess.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 May 2020 07:56:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}

For two-dimensional (2D)\nsystems, stray field measurements can even allow full determination of the\nsource quantity. For instance, a 2D map of the stray magnetic field can be\nuniquely transformed into the 2D current density that gave rise to the field\nand, under some conditions, into the equivalent 2D magnetisation. However,\nimplementing these transformations typically requires truncation of the initial\ndata and involves singularities that may introduce errors, artefacts, and\namplify noise. Here we investigate the possibility of mitigating these issues\nthrough vector measurements. For each scenario (current reconstruction and\nmagnetisation reconstruction) the different possible reconstruction pathways\nare analysed and their performances compared. In particular, we find that the\nsimultaneous measurement of both in-plane components ($B_x$ and $B_y$) enables\nnear-ideal reconstruction of the current density, without singularity or\ntruncation artefacts, which constitutes a significant improvement over\nreconstruction based on a single component (e.g. $B_z$). On the other hand, for\nmagnetisation reconstruction, a single measurement of the out-of-plane field\n($B_z$) is generally the best choice, regardless of the magnetisation\ndirection. We verify these findings experimentally using nitrogen-vacancy\nmagnetometry in the case of a 2D current density and a 2D magnet with\nperpendicular magnetisation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 May 2020 07:58:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-02"}

Under this notion, a fixed number\nof players are allowed to exhibit faulty behavior in which they may deviate\narbitrarily from an equilibrium strategy. A Nash equilibrium in a game with $N$\nplayers is said to be $\\alpha$-tolerant if no non-faulty user wants to deviate\nfrom an equilibrium strategy as long as $N-\\alpha-1$ other players are playing\nthe equilibrium strategies, i.e., it is robust to deviations from rationality\nby $\\alpha$ faulty players. In prior work, $\\alpha$-tolerance has been largely\nviewed as a property of a given Nash equilibria. Here, instead we consider\nfollowing Nash's approach for showing the existence of equilibria, namely,\nthrough the use of best response correspondences and fixed-point arguments. In\nthis manner, we provide sufficient conditions for the existence an\n$\\alpha$-tolerant equilibrium. This involves first defining an\n$\\alpha$-tolerant best response correspondence. Given a strategy profile of\nnon-faulty agents, this correspondence contains strategies for a non-faulty\nplayer that are a best response given any strategy profile of the faulty\nplayers. We prove that if this correspondence is non-empty, then it is\nupper-hemi-continuous. This enables us to apply Kakutani's fixed-point theorem\nand argue that if this correspondence is non-empty for every strategy profile\nof the non-faulty players then there exists an $\\alpha$-tolerant equilibrium.\nHowever, we also illustrate by examples, that in many games this best response\ncorrespondence will be empty for some strategy profiles even though\n$\\alpha$-tolerant equilibira still exist.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 May 2020 08:44:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 May 2022 09:11:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-13"}

This paper describes our\ninvestigation of the root causes of intermittently failing tests in the\nembedded systems domain, with the goal of better understanding, explaining and\ncategorizing the underlying faults. The subject of our investigation is a\ncurrently-running industrial embedded system, along with the system level\ntesting that was performed. We devised and used a novel metric for classifying\ntest cases as intermittent. From more than a half million test verdicts, we\nidentified intermittently and consistently failing tests, and identified their\nroot causes using multiple sources. We found that about 1-3% of all test cases\nwere intermittently failing. From analysis of the case study results and\nrelated work, we identified nine factors associated with test case\nintermittence. We found that a fix for a consistently failing test typically\nremoved a larger number of failures detected by other tests than a fix for an\nintermittent test. We also found that more effort was usually needed to\nidentify fixes for intermittent tests than for consistent tests. An overlap\nbetween root causes leading to intermittent and consistent tests was\nidentified. Many root causes of intermittence are the same in industrial\nembedded systems and open source software. However, when comparing unit testing\nto system level testing, especially for embedded systems, we observed that the\ntest environment itself is often the cause of intermittence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 May 2020 09:14:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-15"}

The performance is measured in the RAM\nmodel of computation with respect to preprocessing time and delay, i.e., the\nmaximum time that elapses between two consecutive outputs. This point of view\nreveals that specific types of output (e.g., excluding the non-reachable pairs\n$(u, v, \\infty)$, or excluding the self-distances $(u, u, 0)$) and the order of\nenumeration (e.g., sorted by distance, sorted row-wise with respect to the\ndistance matrix) have a huge impact on the complexity of APSD while they appear\nto have no effect on SSSD.\n  In particular, we show for APSD that enumeration without output restrictions\nis possible with delay in the order of the average degree. Excluding\nnon-reachable pairs, or requesting the output to be sorted by distance,\nincreases this delay to the order of the maximum degree. Further, for weighted\ngraphs, a delay in the order of the average degree is also not possible without\npreprocessing or considering self-distances as output. In contrast, for SSSD we\nfind that a delay in the order of the maximum degree without preprocessing is\nattainable and unavoidable for any of these requirements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 May 2020 09:14:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2021 12:50:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-18"}

Our design incorporates: (i) a planar\nmultilayer geometry that generates a large field of 4.35 mT per unit current,\n(ii) a 50 Ohm transmission circuit with a broad excitation bandwidth of\napproximately 20 MHz, and (iii) an optimized thermal management for removal of\nJoule heating. Using individual 13C nuclear spins in the vicinity of a diamond\nnitrogen-vacancy (NV) center as a test system, we demonstrate Rabi frequencies\nexceeding 70 kHz and nuclear pi/2 rotations within 3.4 us. The extrapolated\nvalues for 1H spins are about 240 kHz and 1 us, respectively.

A voltage biased normal-metal--insulator--superconductor\njunction equipped with such a trap is used to investigate on the trapping\nperformance and the part played by the superconducting proximity effect\ntherein. This involves an appropriate one-dimensional model of the junction and\nthe numerical solution of Usadel equations describing the non-equilibrium state\nof the superconductor. The functionality of the trap is determined by the\ndensity of states (DOS) at the tunnel barrier.

In particular, we assume that an epidemic spreads stochastically on a\nscale-free network and that each infected individual in the network gains a\ntemporary immunity after its infectious period is over. After the temporary\nimmunity period is over, the individual becomes susceptible to the virus again.\nWhen the underlying contact network is embedded in Euclidean geometry, we model\nthree different intervention strategies that aim to control the spread of the\nepidemic: social distancing, restrictions on travel, and restrictions on\nmaximal number of social contacts per node. Our first finding is that on a\nfinite network, a long enough average immunity period leads to extinction of\nthe pandemic after the first peak, analogous to the concept of \"herd immunity\".\nFor each model, there is a critical average immunity length $L_c$ above which\nthis happens. Our second finding is that all three interventions manage to\nflatten the first peak (the travel restrictions most efficiently), as well as\ndecrease the critical immunity length $L_c$, but elongate the epidemic.\nHowever, when the average immunity length $L$ is shorter than $L_c$, the price\nfor the flattened first peak is often a high second peak: for limiting the\nmaximal number of contacts, the second peak can be as high as 1/3 of the first\npeak, and twice as high as it would be without intervention. Thirdly,\ninterventions introduce oscillations into the system and the time to reach\nequilibrium is, for almost all scenarios, much longer. We conclude that\nnetwork-based epidemic models can show a variety of behaviors that are not\ncaptured by the continuous compartmental models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 May 2020 11:38:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-16"}

Writing build\ndefinitions that lead to error-free incremental and parallel builds is a\nchallenging task. This is mainly because developers are often unable to predict\nthe effects of build operations on the file system and how different build\noperations interact with each other. Faulty build scripts may seriously degrade\nthe reliability of automated builds, as they cause build failures, and\nnon-deterministic and incorrect build results.\n  To reason about arbitrary build executions, we present buildfs, a\ngenerally-applicable model that takes into account the specification (as\ndeclared in build scripts) and the actual behavior (low-level file system\noperation) of build operations. We then formally define different types of\nfaults related to incremental and parallel builds in terms of the conditions\nunder which a file system operation violates the specification of a build\noperation. Our testing approach, which relies on the proposed model, analyzes\nthe execution of single full build, translates it into buildfs, and uncovers\nfaults by checking for corresponding violations.\n  We evaluate the effectiveness, efficiency, and applicability of our approach\nby examining hundreds of Make and Gradle projects.

Today virtually every computer is built out of\nmulti-core processors. Hence it is important to take advantage of such parallel\ncomputing power by parallelizing existing algorithms and applications. Most of\nthe earlier work on parallelizing MST focused on algorithms for PRAM models.\nThere are two limitations to such studies. First, PRAM models assume infinite\nmemory bandwidth which is unrealistic. Second, PRAM model based algorithms\nrequire at least O(n) processors where n being total number of vertices. For\nlarge graphs this is infeasible. There are very few implementations which\ntarget real systems. In this paper I present and evaluate two new parallel MST\nalgorithms that are a variant of Parallel Boruvka algorithms: i) First\nalgorithm uses lock variables without spin-locks ii) Second algorithm uses only\natomic compare-and-swap (CAS) primitive. I evaluated the performance of these\nalgorithms on a six-core, 12-thread Intel system on various input graphs of\nsizes up to 1 million vertices. First algorithm showed a speedup of up to1.94\nover an un-optimized sequential algorithm and a speedup of up to 1.4 over an\noptimized sequential algorithm. Second algorithm showed a speedup of up to 2.03\nover an un-optimized sequential algorithm and a speedup of up to 1.403 over an\noptimized sequential algorithm. When second algorithm using CAS is compared\nwith the first algorithm second algorithm is found to be up to 1.15 times\nbetter than the first algorithm at four threads.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 May 2020 12:30:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-15"}

Advanced ab initio methods are utilized to calculate the\npotential energy and dipole moment surfaces (PESs and DMSs), and semi-empirical\nPESs are then obtained by combining ab initio and experimental data.

In the special case that the targets are future\nobservations, the ESN is learning the next step map, which allows time series\nforecasting. We demonstrate the theory numerically by training an ESN using\nTikhonov least squares on a sequence of scalar observations of the Lorenz\nsystem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 May 2020 13:39:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Feb 2021 16:23:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-07"}

Here, using just the\ntime-reversibility of classical microscopic laws, we identify three types of\nthe Landauer's erasure principle depending on the relation between the two\nfinal environments: the one linked to a logical input 1 and the other to the\nlogical input 0. The strong type (which is the original Landauer's formulation)\nrequires the final environments to be in thermal equilibrium.

In detail, at low fO2, liquids\nhave high Cr contents, but the variation of log [Cr, ppm] is not a linear\nfunction of log fO2. Using our new data and data from the literature a model\nfor Cr concentrations at chromite/magnesiochromite saturation in silicate melts\nhas been developed based upon a thermodynamic formalism. Our model may be used\nto assess the effect of melt composition on chromite and magnesiochromite\nsolubility in silicate melts during peridotite melting and assimilation. At\nmoderate and high oxygen fugacities, concentration levels of Cr at chromite\nsaturation are higher for ultramafic than for felsic rocks. Our data imply that\nassimilation of magnesiochromite-bearing serpentinite lithosphere could result\nin high Cr contents in mafic melts, triggering massive crystallization of\nchromite, especially upon the system hydridization, cooling, oxidation and\nmagma degassing. Our model may be applied for quantitative prediction of\nchromite crystallization and formation of the terrestrial mantle-crust\ntransition zones and mantle represented by chromitites and dunites.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 May 2020 15:29:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-15"}

Simplicial learning is an adaptation of dictionary\nlearning, where subspaces become clipped and acquire arbitrary offsets, taking\nthe form of simplices. Such adaptation is achieved through additional\nconstraints on sparse codes. Furthermore, an evolutionary approach can be\nchosen to determine the number and the dimensionality of simplices composing\nthe simplicial, in which most generative and compact simplicials are favored.\nThis paper proposes an evolutionary simplicial learning method as a generative\nand compact sparse framework for classification. The proposed approach is first\napplied on a one-class classification task and it appears as the most reliable\nmethod within the considered benchmark. Most surprising results are observed\nwhen evolutionary simplicial learning is considered within a multi-class\nclassification task. Since sparse representations are generative in nature,\nthey bear a fundamental problem of not being capable of distinguishing two\nclasses lying on the same subspace. This claim is validated through synthetic\nexperiments and superiority of simplicial learning even as a generative-only\napproach is demonstrated.

The typical approach to\nACE is to train a deep classification model (neural chord estimator) in a\nsupervised manner by using only annotated music signals. In this discriminative\napproach, prior knowledge about chord label sequences (model output) has\nscarcely been taken into account. In contrast, we propose a unified generative\nand discriminative approach in the framework of amortized variational\ninference. More specifically, we formulate a deep generative model that\nrepresents the generative process of chroma vectors (observed variables) from\ndiscrete labels and continuous features (latent variables), which are assumed\nto follow a Markov model favoring self-transitions and a standard Gaussian\ndistribution, respectively. Given chroma vectors as observed data, the\nposterior distributions of the latent labels and features are computed\napproximately by using deep classification and recognition models,\nrespectively. These three models form a variational autoencoder and can be\ntrained jointly in a semi-supervised manner. The experimental results show that\nthe regularization of the classification model based on the Markov prior of\nchord labels and the generative model of chroma vectors improved the\nperformance of ACE even under the supervised condition.

Selection of a winner is accomplished via a voting rule,\ne.g., rank-order voting, majority rule, plurality rule, approval voting. Which\nvoting rule should be used? In social choice theory, desirable properties of\nvoting rules are expressed as axioms to be satisfied. This thesis focuses on\naxioms concerning strategic manipulation by voters. Sometimes, voters may\nintentionally misstate their true preferences in order to alter the outcome for\ntheir own advantage. For example, in plurality rule, if a voter knows that\ntheir top-choice candidate will lose, then they might instead vote for their\nsecond-choice candidate just to avoid an even less desirable result. When no\ncoalition of voters can strategically manipulate, then the voting rule is said\nto satisfy the axiom of Strategy-Proofness. A less restrictive axiom is Weak\nStrategy-Proofness (as defined by Dasgupta and Maskin (2019)), which allows for\nstrategic manipulation by all but the smallest coalitions. Under certain\nintuitive conditions, Dasgupta and Maskin (2019) proved that the only voting\nrules satisfying Strategy-Proofness are rank-order voting and majority rule.

Questions on whether governments have acted promptly enough, and\nwhether lockdown measures can be lifted soon have since been central in public\ndiscourse. Data-driven models that predict COVID-19 fatalities under different\nlockdown policy scenarios are essential for addressing these questions and\ninforming governments on future policy directions. To this end, this paper\ndevelops a Bayesian model for predicting the effects of COVID-19 lockdown\npolicies in a global context -- we treat each country as a distinct data point,\nand exploit variations of policies across countries to learn country-specific\npolicy effects. Our model utilizes a two-layer Gaussian process (GP) prior --\nthe lower layer uses a compartmental SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected,\nRecovered) model as a prior mean function with \"country-and-policy-specific\"\nparameters that capture fatality curves under \"counterfactual\" policies within\neach country, whereas the upper layer is shared across all countries, and\nlearns lower-layer SEIR parameters as a function of a country's features and\nits policy indicators.

I measure the performance\nof the proposed method using a Foursquare check-in dataset.The results show\nthat the proposed method performs better than the state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 May 2020 14:57:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-28"}

In space, generally, cells are always illuminated with AM0 spectrum and no\nimpact is expected from spectral variations.

Worldwide, hundreds of thousands of jobs\nare linked to the sportfishing industry, which generates billions of dollars\nfor water-side communities and fisheries conservatories alike. However, the\nsheer popularity of recreational fishing poses threats to aquatic biodiversity\nthat are hard to regulate. For example, as much as 25% of overfished\npopulations can be traced to anglers. This alarming statistic is explained by\nthe average catch and release mortality rate of 43%, which primarily results\nfrom hook-related injuries and careless out-of-water handling. The\nprovisional-patented design proposed in this paper addresses both these\nproblems separately First, a novel, electrical muscle stimulation based fishing\nlure is proposed as a harmless and low cost alternative to sharp hooks. Early\nprototypes show a constant electrical current of 90 mA applied through a 200g\nEuropean perch's jaw can support a reeling tension of 2N - safely within the\nnecessary ranges. Second, a fish-eye camera bob is designed to wirelessly relay\nunderwater footage to a smartphone app, where an ensemble convolutional neural\nnetwork automatically classifies the fish's species, estimates its length, and\ncross references with local and state fishing regulations (ie. minimum size,\nmaximum bag limit, and catch season). This capability reduces overfishing by\nhelping anglers avoid accidentally violating guidelines and eliminates the need\nto reel the fish in and expose it to negligent handling. IN conjunction, this\ncheap, lightweight, yet high-tech invention is a paradigm shift in preserving a\nworld favorite pastime; while at the same time making recreational fishing more\nsustainable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 May 2020 20:35:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Jan 2023 22:33:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-18"}
