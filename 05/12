A novel one-step unknown\ninput Kalman filter is proposed and has guaranteed stability when the number of\nunknown inputs is equal to that of the measurements. The design of unknown\ninput Kalman filters and observers is unified. Furthermore, an adaptive\naugmented Kalman filter which requires the modeling of unknown inputs is\nintroduced.

However, it was soon discovered that the actual magnetic\nstructure broke the rotational symmetry and internal pressure was later\nsuggested as a route to stabilize the desired magnetic state. In this work we\ntest this prediction by synthesizing a series of Eu$_{1-x}$Ba$_x$Cd$_2$As$_2$\nsingle crystals and studying their structural, magnetic and transport\nproperties via both experimental techniques and first-principles calculations.\nWe find that small concentrations of Ba ($\\sim 3-10\\% $) lead to a small\nout-of-plane canting of the Eu moment. However, for higher concentrations this\neffect is suppressed and a nearly in-plane model is recovered. Studying the\ntransport properties we find that all compositions show evidence of an\nAnomalous Hall Effect dominated by the intrinsic mechanism as well as large\nnegative magnetoresistances in the longitudinal channel. A non-monotonic\nevolution of the transport properties is seen across the series which\ncorrelates to the proposed canting suggesting canting may enhance the\ntopological effects. Careful density functional theory calculations using an\nall-electron approach revise prior predictions finding a purely ferromagnetic\nground state with in-plane moments for both the EuCd$_2$As$_2$ and\nEu$_{0.5}$Ba$_{0.5}$Cd$_2$As$_2$ compounds - corroborating our experimental\nfindings.

Since\nthe spectroscopic observations of stellar activity at the Mount Wilson\nObservatory, the solar analog HD43587 has shown a very low and apparently\ninvariant activity level, which makes it a Maunder minimum candidate. We\nanalyze the chromospheric activity evolution of HD43587 and its evolutive\nstatus, intending to unravel the reasons for this low and flat activity. We use\nan activity measurements dataset available in the literature, and compute the\nactivity S-index from HARPS and NARVAL spectra, to infer a cycle period.\nBesides, we analyze the CoRoT light-curve of HD43587, and apply gyrochronology\nand activity calibrations, to determine its rotation period. Finally, based on\nan evolutionary model and the inferred rotation period, we use the EULAG-MHD\ncode to perform global MHD simulations of HD43587 with the aim of getting some\ninsights about its dynamo process. We confirm the almost flat activity profile,\nwith a cycle period $P_{\\mathrm{cyc}} = 10.44\\pm3.03$ yrs deduced from the\nS-index time series, and a long-term trend that might be a period larger than\n50 yrs. It was impossible to define a rotation period from the light-curve,\nhowever gyrochronology and activity calibrations allow to infer an indirect\nestimate of $\\overline{P}_{\\mathrm{rot}} = 22.6 \\pm 1.9$ d. Furthermore, the\nMHD simulations confirm an oscillatory dynamo with a cycle period in good\nagreement with the observations and a low level of surface magnetic activity.\nWe conclude that this object might be experiencing a \"natural\" decrease in\nmagnetic activity as a consequence of its age. Nevertheless, the possibility\nthat HD43587 is in a Maunder minimum phase cannot be ruled out.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 May 2020 16:17:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 13 Aug 2020 19:03:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-17"}

Therefore, it has\nbeen recently proposed to use NMPC as a function approximator within RL.

For the\ntemperature increase due to greenhouse gas emissions, we take 2 {\\deg}C and 5\n{\\deg}C as our lower and upper bounds.

Since\nthen, known as COVID-19 disease, the responsible viral pathogen, SARS-CoV-2,\nhas spread around the world in a pandemic. Decisions on how to deal with the\ncrisis are often based on simulations of the pandemic spread of the virus. The\nresults of some of these, as well as their methodology and possibilities for\nimprovement, will be described in more detail in this paper in order to inform\nbeyond the current public health dogma called \"flatten-the-curve\". There are\nseveral ways to model an epidemic in order to simulate the spread of diseases.\nDepending on the timeliness, scope and quality of the associated real data,\nthese multivariable models differ in the value of used parameters, but also in\nthe selection of considered influencing factors. It was exemplarily shown that\nepidemics in their course are simulated more realistically by models that\nassume subexponential growth. Furthermore, various simulations of the COVID-19\npandemic were presented in an European perspective, compared against each other\nand discussed in more detail. It is difficult to estimate how credible the\nsimulations of the pandemic models currently are, so it remains to be seen\nwhether the spread of the pandemic can be effectively reduced by the measures\ntaken. Whether a model works well in reality is largely determined by the\nquality and scope of its underlying data. Past studies have shown that\ncountermeasures are able to reduce reproduction numbers or transmission rates\nin epidemics. In addition to that, the presented modelling study provides a\ngood framework for the creation of subexponential-growth-models for assessing\nthe spread of COVID-19.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 May 2020 16:42:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-12"}

Although active magnetars are commonly invoked FRB\nsources, several distinct mechanisms have been proposed for generating the\nradio emission which make different predictions for the accompanying higher\nfrequency radiation.

The profile of G is\nthe function phi which counts, for each n, the number phi(n) of orbits of G\nacting on the n-subsets of E. Counting functions arising this way, and their\nassociated generating series, form a rich yet apparently strongly constrained\nclass. In particular, Cameron conjectured in the late seventies that, whenever\nthe profile phi(n) is bounded by a polynomial -- we say that G is\nP-oligomorphic --, it is asymptotically equivalent to a polynomial. In 1985,\nMacpherson further asked whether the orbit algebra of G -- a graded commutative\nalgebra invented by Cameron and whose Hilbert function is phi -- is finitely\ngenerated.\n  In this paper we establish a classification of (closed) P-oligomorphic\npermutation groups in terms of finite permutation groups with decorated blocks.\n  It follows from the classification that the orbit algebra of any\nP-oligomorphic group is isomorphic to (a straightforward quotient of) the\ninvariant ring of some finite permutation group. This answers positively both\nCameron's conjecture and Macpherson's question. The orbit algebra is in fact\nCohen-Macaulay; therefore the generating series of phi is a rational fraction\nwhose numerator has positive coefficients, while the denominator admits a\ncombinatorial description.\n  In addition, the classification provides a finite data structure for encoding\nclosed P-oligomorphic groups. This paves the way for computing with them and\nenumerating them as well as for proofs by structural induction. Finally, the\nrelative simplicity of the classification gives hopes to extend the study to,\ne.g., the class of (closed) permutations groups with sub-exponential profile.\n  The proof exploits classical notions from group theory -- notably block\nsystems and their lattice properties --, commutative algebra, and invariant\ntheory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 May 2020 17:56:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 May 2020 14:38:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-01"}

One method of\nconstructing a quantum field with a finite minimum length scale is to use\nbandlimited quantum field theory, where the spacetime is mathematically both\ncontinuous and discrete. This is a modification to the field, which has been\nshown to have many consequences at the level of the field.

We explore two different types of\nswitching functions, Gaussian and Dirac delta. We find that with Gaussian\nswitching, the bandlimit exponentially suppresses the de-excitation of the\ndetectors when the energy gap between the two levels is larger than the\nbandlimit. If the detectors are prepared in ground state, in certain regions of\nthe parameter space they are able to extract more entanglement from the field\nthan if there was no bandlimit.

The quantum dynamics always reduces to the one of a\ntime-dependent Schr\\\"{o}edinger equation for a harmonic potential with a time\ndependent frequency. The vacuum case is treated in the limits of a collpasing\nand an expanding Universe, while the dynamics in presence of $\\phi$ and\n$\\Lambda$ is studied for $t \\rightarrow \\infty $. In both analysis the quantum\ndynamics of the anisotropy variable is associated to a decaying standard\ndeviation of its probability density, corresponding to a suppression of the\nquantum anisotropy associated. In the vacuum case, the corner configuration\nbecomes an attractor for the dynamics and the evolution resembles that one of a\nTaub cosmology in the limit of a non-singular initial Universe. This suggests\nthat if the Bianchi dynamics enters enough the potential corner then the\ninitial singularity is removed and a Taub picture emerges. The case when $\\phi$\nis present well mimics the De-Sitter phase of an inflationary Universe. Here we\nshow that both the classical and quantum anisotropies are exponentially\nsuppressed, so that the resulting dynamics corresponds to an isotropic closed\nRobertson-Walker geometry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 May 2020 18:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 May 2020 14:24:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-21"}

The probability of\nfinding any coincident radio-emitting tidal disruption event by chance is 0.5%,\nwhile the probability of finding one as bright in bolometric energy flux as\nAT2019dsg is 0.2%. Our electromagnetic observations can be explained through a\nmulti-zone model, with radio analysis revealing a central engine, embedded in a\nUV photosphere, that powers an extended synchrotron-emitting outflow. This\nprovides an ideal site for PeV neutrino production.

In this work, we develop\na line de-confusion technique in map space capable of reconstructing the\nthree-dimensional spatial distribution of line-emitting sources. If multiple\nspectral lines of a source population are observable in multiple frequencies,\nusing the sparse approximation, our technique iteratively extracts sources\nalong a given line of sight by fitting the LIM data to a set of spectral\ntemplates.

The current state of the art in wireless technologies for\nuntethered biopotential recordings rely on radiative electromagnetic (EM)\nfields. In such transmissions, only a small fraction of this energy is received\nsince the EM fields are widely radiated resulting in lossy inefficient systems.\nUsing the body as a communication medium (similar to a 'wire') allows for the\ncontainment of the energy within the body, yielding order(s) of magnitude lower\nloss than radiative EM communication. In this work, we introduce Animal Body\nCommunication (ABC), which utilizes the concept of using the body as a medium\ninto the domain of chronic animal biopotential recording. This work, for the\nfirst time, develops the theory and models for animal body communication\ncircuitry and channel loss. Using this theoretical model, a sub-inch$^3$,\ncustom-designed sensor node is built using off the shelf components which is\ncapable of sensing and transmitting biopotential signals, through the body of\nthe rat at significantly lower powers compared to traditional wireless\ntransmissions. In-vivo experimental analysis proves that ABC successfully\ntransmits acquired electrocardiogram (EKG) signals through the body with\ncorrelation accuracy >99% when compared to traditional wireless communication\nmodalities, with a 50x reduction in power consumption.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 May 2020 18:32:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-13"}

In the case that neutrinos are Dirac\nparticles, the lowest-order prediction of this construction is then one\nmassless neutrino and two degenerate massive neutrinos.

We used temperatures and gravities from a iacob-gbat/fastwind\nspectroscopic analysis to locate our sample in the Kiel and spectroscopic HR\ndiagrams. We evaluated the completeness of our sample of stars, observational\nbiases using information from the Galactic O star catalog (GOSC), systematics\nof our methodology, and compare with other recent studies using smaller samples\nof Galactic O-type stars. We base our discussion on the spectroscopic HR\ndiagram to avoid the use of uncertain distances. We performed a detailed study\nof the young cluster Trumpler-14 as an example of how Gaia cluster distances\ncan help to construct the associated classical HR diagram. The apparent lack of\nmassive O-type stars near the ZAMS with masses between 30 and 70 Msol persist\neven when spectroscopic results from a large, non-biased sample of stars are\nused. We do not find correlation between the dearth of stars and observational\nbiases, limitations of our methodology, or the use of spectroscopic HR diagram\ninstead of the classical one. Investigating the efficiency of mass accretion\nduring the formation process we conclude that an adjustment of the accretion\nrate towards lower values could reconcile the hotter boundary of detected\nO-type stars and the theoretical birthline. Last, we discuss that the presence\nof a small sample of O2-O3.5 stars found closer to the ZAMS might be explained\ntaking into account non-standard star evolution (e.g. binary interaction,\nmergers, or homogeneous evolution).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 May 2020 21:30:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 May 2020 09:47:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 5 Jul 2020 16:26:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-07"}

In a geophysical context, the settling of dense crystals controls\nthe mode of solidification of magma chambers and planetary-scale magma oceans,\nwhile rising of light bubbles of volatiles drives volcanic outgassing and the\nformation of primordial atmospheres. Motivated by these geophysical systems, we\nperform a systematic numerical study on the settling rate of particles in a\nrectangular two-dimensional Rayleigh-Benard system with Rayleigh number up to\n10^12 and Prandtl number from 10 to 50. Under the idealized condition of\nspherically-shaped particles with small Reynolds number, two limiting\nbehaviours exist for the settling velocity. On the one hand, Stokes' law\napplies to particles with small but finite response time, leading to a constant\nsettling rate. On the other hand, particles with a vanishing response time are\nexpected to settle at an exponential rate. Based on our simulations, we present\na new physical model that bridges the gap between the above limiting behaviours\nby describing the sedimentation of inertial particles as a random process with\ntwo key components: i) the transport of particles from vigorously convecting\nregions into sluggish, low-velocity \"piles\" that naturally develop at the\nhorizontal boundaries of the system, and ii) the probability that particles\nescape such low-velocity regions without settling at their base. In addition,\nwe identify four distinct settling regimes and analyze the horizontal\ndistribution of sedimented particles. For two of these regimes settling is\nparticularly slow and the distribution is strongly non-uniform, with dense\nparticles being deposited preferentially below major clusters of upwellings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 May 2020 21:33:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-16"}

A recent\nmodel, called REAPER, aims to find the principal components by solving a convex\noptimization problem. Usually the number of principal components must be\ndetermined in advance and the minimization is performed over symmetric positive\nsemi-definite matrices having the size of the data, although the number of\nprincipal components is substantially smaller. This prohibits its use if the\ndimension of the data is large which is often the case in image processing.\n  In this paper, we propose a regularized version of REAPER which enforces the\nsparsity of the number of principal components by penalizing the nuclear norm\nof the corresponding orthogonal projector. This has the advantage that only an\nupper bound on the number of principal components is required. Our second\ncontribution is a matrix-free algorithm to find a minimizer of the regularized\nREAPER which is also suited for high dimensional data.

Consequently, the use of spatio-temporal models\nunder the TGMRF framework leads to a new class of general models, such as\nspatio-temporal Gamma random fields, that can be directly used to model Poisson\nintensity for space-time data. The proposed model was applied to identify\nimportant environmental characteristics that affect variation in the abundance\nof Nenia tridens, a dominant species of snail in a well-studied tropical\necosystem, and to characterize its spatial and temporal trends, which are\nparticularly critical during the Anthropocene, an epoch of time characterized\nby human-induced environmental change associated with climate and land use.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 May 2020 22:07:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-13"}

The newly commissioned NIST EBIT TES Spectrometer\n(NETS) improves the measurement capabilities of the EBIT through a combination\nof high x-ray collection efficiency and resolving power. NETS utilizes 192\nindividual TES x-ray microcalorimeters (166/192 yield) to improve upon the\ncollection area by a factor of ~30 over the 4-pixel neutron transmutation doped\ngermanium-based microcalorimeter spectrometer previously used at the NIST EBIT.\nThe NETS microcalorimeters are optimized for the x-ray energies from roughly\n500 eV to 8,000 eV and achieve an energy resolution of 3.7 eV to 5.0 eV over\nthis range, a more modest (<2X) improvement over the previous\nmicrocalorimeters. Beyond this energy range NETS can operate with various\ntrade-offs, the most significant of which are reduced efficiency at lower\nenergies and being limited to a subset of the pixels at higher energies. As an\ninitial demonstration of the capabilities of NETS, we measured transitions in\nHe-like and H-like O, Ne, and Ar as well as Ni-like W. We detail the energy\ncalibration and data analysis techniques used to transform detector counts into\nx-ray spectra, a process that will be the basis for analyzing future data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 May 2020 23:23:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-13"}

In\nthis paper it has been shown that the charged pion condensation is generated by\nchiral imbalance in the dense electric neutral quark/baryonic matter in\n$\\beta$-equilibrium, i. e. matter in neutron stars. It has been also\ndemonstrated that pion condensation is inevitable phenomenon in dense quark\nmatter with chiral imbalance if there is non-zero chiral imbalance in two\nforms, chiral and chiral isospin one.

With 3D space voxelization, the\nkey idea of 3DV is to encode 3D motion information within depth video into a\nregular voxel set (i.e., 3DV) compactly, via temporal rank pooling. Each\navailable 3DV voxel intrinsically involves 3D spatial and motion feature\njointly. 3DV is then abstracted as a point set and input into PointNet++ for 3D\naction recognition, in the end-to-end learning way. The intuition for\ntransferring 3DV into the point set form is that, PointNet++ is lightweight and\neffective for deep feature learning towards point set. Since 3DV may lose\nappearance clue, a multi-stream 3D action recognition manner is also proposed\nto learn motion and appearance feature jointly. To extract richer temporal\norder information of actions, we also divide the depth video into temporal\nsplits and encode this procedure in 3DV integrally. The extensive experiments\non 4 well-established benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our\nproposition.

The VQ-VAE model\nlearns a mapping function from a speech waveform into a sequence of discrete\nsymbols, and then the Transformer-NMT model is trained to estimate this\ndiscrete symbol sequence from a given input text. Since the VQ-VAE model can\nlearn such a mapping in a fully-data-driven manner, we do not need to consider\nhyperparameters of the feature extraction required in the conventional E2E-TTS\nmodels.

It is more likely to\napproximate the intrinsic distributions of internal responses than any specific\ndistribution. Besides, since the shape factor is more robust to different\ndatabases rather than the other two parameters, we propose to construct\ndiscriminative features via the shape factor for adversarial detection,\nemploying the magnitude of Benford-Fourier coefficients (MBF), which can be\neasily estimated using responses. Finally, a support vector machine is trained\nas the adversarial detector through leveraging the MBF features. Extensive\nexperiments in terms of image classification demonstrate that the proposed\ndetector is much more effective and robust on detecting adversarial examples of\ndifferent crafting methods and different sources, compared to state-of-the-art\nadversarial detection methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 May 2020 05:20:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-26"}

This study\npresents a novel approach for detecting TA activity by first detecting the\ninter-bursts and then processing the temporal map of the bursts and\ninter-bursts. EEG recordings from 72 healthy term neonates were used to develop\nand evaluate performance of 1) an inter-burst detection method which is then\nused for 2) detection of TA activity. First, multiple amplitude and spectral\nfeatures were combined using a support vector machine (SVM) to classify bursts\nfrom inter-bursts within TA activity, resulting in a median area under the\noperating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.95 (95% confidence interval, CI: 0.93\nto 0.98).

These results validate how an inter-burst detection approach combined\nwith post processing can be used to classify TA activity.

For\ndeveloping competitive SIBs, highly efficient anode materials with large\ncapacity and rapid ion diffusion are indispensable. In this study, a\ntwo-dimensional (2D) Dirac monolayer, that is borophosphene, is proposed to be\na promising anode material for high performance SIBs on the basis of density\nfunctional theory calculations. The performances of Na adsorption and\ndiffusion, maximum specific capacity, open circuit voltage, cyclical stability\nand electronic properties combined with Bader charge analysis are explored. It\nis found that the borophosphene can spontaneously adsorb Na atom with binding\nenergy of -0.838 eV. A low diffusion energy barrier of 0.221 eV suggests rapid\nion conductivity. More intriguingly, a maximum specific capacity of 1282 mAh/g\ncan be achieved in borophosphene, which is one of the largest values reported\nin 2D anode materials for SIBs. A low average voltage of 0.367 V is estimated,\nimplying a suitable voltage of the anode material. Metallic properties, tiny\nsurface expansion, and good kinetic stability of sodiated borophosphene give\nrise to high electrical conductivity and favorable cyclability.

Two approaches of assigning base gate costs were used. First, costs\nwere reduced to $T$-counts by recursively applying a $Z$-rotation catalyst\ncircuit.

In this paper, we first introduce Figures of Merit for\nphased array radar operation and performance. We compute these metrics on a set\nof test scenarios of varying complexity, involving different kinds of targets,\nand we aggregate them into a global notation of MFR radar performances. To\nachieve our purpose, we rely on the domain of Multi Criteria Decision Analysis\n(MCDA), and more precisely 2-additive Choquet integral.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 May 2020 08:21:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-13"}

Here, a tractable\nkinetic model based on the generalized Enskog equation and the mean-field\ntheory is employed to couple the effects of the volume exclusion and the\nlong-range intermolecular attraction forces. The interactions between gas\nmolecules and confined surface are modelled by a 10-4-3 Lennard-Jones\npotential, which can capture gas surface adsorption. The cross-sectional\ndensity profiles of methane under different confinements are in good agreement\nwith the molecular dynamics results reported in the literature, and the\ntransport behaviors are validated by the non-equilibrium molecular dynamics.\nThe velocity of methane flow in shale matrix is plug-like due to its dense\ncharacteristics in nanopores. The influence of pressure, temperature, pore size\nand shale composition on density and velocity profiles is analyzed\nquantitatively. Our results show that the Klinkenberg correction is not\napplicable to model shale gas flow in the production process; the Navier-Stokes\nmodel using the second-order slip boundary condition cannot produce the proper\nvelocity profiles, and consequently fails to predict the accurate flow rate in\nnanopores. This study sheds new light on understanding the physics of\nnon-equilibrium dense gas flows in shale strata.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 May 2020 08:57:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-13"}

Simply upscaling with image\nsuper-resolution methods results in unsatisfactory recovering performance.

A growing leaf is an example of such a system: it increases its area by\norders of magnitude, maintaining a proper (usually flat) shape. How can this be\nachieved without a central control unit? One would think that a combination of\nuniform growth with viscoelastic rheology would allow that. Here we show that\nthat the exact opposite process is in action: the natural growth of the leaf\nsurface strongly fluctuates in time and position. By combining high resolution\nmeasurements and multi-scale statistical analysis, we suggest a paradigm-change\nin the way leaf growth is viewed. We measure the in-plane tissue growth of\nTobacco leaves in Lagrangian coordinates in 3D and study the statistics of\nthree scalar fields associated with the tensorial growth field: The growth\nrate, its isotropy and directionality. We identify the governing time and\nlength scales of the fluctuations in the growth rate, and capture abundant\nswitching between local area swelling and shrinking, when measured in high\nresolution. At lower spatio-temporal resolution the growth rate field becomes\nsmooth. In contrast, the anisotropy field increases over time. Finally, we find\nsignificant differences between growth measured during day and night. The\ngrowth at night is found to be more intermittent, with shorter correlation\nlengths and no global directionality. Despite its fluctuative nature, growth\nfields are not random, thus carry information about growth regulation. Indeed,\nmechanical analysis shows that a growing leaf can stay flat only if the\nmeasured fluctuations are regulated/correlated. Our measurements suggest that\nthe entire statistics of growth fields, and not just their means, should be\nstudied. In particular, the regulation of such fields and the link between\ntheir characteristics and the global geometry of a leaf should be studied.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 May 2020 10:03:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-13"}

Indeed,\ntheories and definitions of life typically rely on sets of emergent properties,\nsuch as growth, capacity to evolve and apparent purpose (agency), that are only\nsymptomatic of intrinsic functioning. Crucially, empirical studies demonstrate\nthat biological molecules such as ratcheting/rotating enzymes (motor proteins),\nribozymes and chlorophyll undergo repetitive conformation state changes driven\nby thermal agitation and/or energy exchanges. These molecules exhibit disparate\nstructures and roles, but all govern biological processes relying on\ndirectional physical motion (e.g., DNA transcription, translation, ATP\nsynthesis, cytoskeleton transport, photosynthetic resonance energy transfer).\nFundamentally, they share the mechanistic principle of repetitive conformation\nchanges in one plane (uniplanar) driven by thermodynamic gradients, producing\ndependable unidirectional motion: all are heat engines using thermodynamic\ndisequilibria to perform work. Recognition that disparate biological molecules\nshare a heat engine principle governing directional motion, working in\nself-regulating networks, allows a robust, mechanistic definition of life: life\nis a self-regulating process whereby matter undergoes cyclic, uniplanar\nconformation state changes that convert thermodynamic disequilibria into\ndirected motion, performing work that locally reduces entropy. A living thing\nis thus a structure comprising, at least in part, an autonomous network of\nunits operating on the heat engine principle. Death is loss of integrated heat\nengine function.

In this work, we\npropose a data-based attribution approach for selecting which driver best\nrelates to variations in time of the flood frequency curve. The flood peaks are\nassumed to follow a Gumbel distribution, whose location parameter changes in\ntime as a function of the decadal variations of one of the following\nalternative covariates: annual and extreme precipitation for different\ndurations, an agricultural land-use intensification index, and reservoir\nconstruction in the catchment, quantified by an index. The parameters of this\nattribution model are estimated by Bayesian inference. Prior information on one\nof these parameters, the elasticity of flood peaks to the respective driver, is\ntaken from the existing literature to increase the robustness of the method to\nspurious correlations between flood and covariate time series. Therefore, the\nattribution model is informed in two ways: by the use of covariates,\nrepresenting the drivers of change, and by the priors, representing the\nhydrological understanding of how these covariates influence floods. The\nWatanabe-Akaike information criterion is used to compare models involving\nalternative covariates. We apply the approach to 96 catchments in Upper\nAustria, where positive flood peak trends have been observed in the past 50\nyears. Results show that, in Upper Austria, one or seven day extreme\nprecipitation is usually a better covariate for variations of the flood\nfrequency curve than precipitation at longer time scales. Agricultural land-use\nintensification rarely is the best covariate, and the reservoir index never is,\nsuggesting that catchment and river drivers are less important than atmospheric\nones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 May 2020 10:20:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-13"}

However, the current practice on fuel loading, which has a\nsignificant impact on aircraft weight and fuel consumption, has yet to be\nthoroughly addressed by existing studies. Excess fuel is loaded by dispatchers\nand (or) pilots to handle fuel consumption uncertainties, primarily caused by\nflight time uncertainties, which cannot be predicted by current Flight Planning\nSystems. In this paper, we develop a novel spatial weighted recurrent neural\nnetwork model to provide better flight time predictions by capturing air\ntraffic information at a national scale based on multiple data sources,\nincluding Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast, Meteorological Aerodrome\nReports, and airline records. In this model, a spatial weighted layer is\ndesigned to extract spatial dependences among network delay states. Then, a new\ntraining procedure associated with the spatial weighted layer is introduced to\nextract OD-specific spatial weights. Long short-term memory networks are used\nto extract the temporal behavior patterns of network delay states. Finally,\nfeatures from delays, weather, and flight schedules are fed into a fully\nconnected neural network to predict the flight time of a particular flight. The\nproposed model was evaluated using one year of historical data from an\nairline's real operations. Results show that our model can provide more\naccurate flight time predictions than baseline methods, especially for flights\nwith extreme delays.

Several theoretical and recently also experimental works have shown that\nthe spin-wave phase can be manipulated by the transmission through a domain\nwall (DW). Here, we study propagation of spin waves through a DW by means of\nmicro-focused Brillouin light scattering microscopy ($\\mu$BLS). The acquired 2D\nspin-wave intensity maps reveal that spin-wave transmission through a N\\'eel DW\nis influenced by a topologically enforced circular Bloch line in the DW center\nand that the propagation regime depends on the spin-wave frequency. In the\nfirst regime, two spin-wave beams propagating around the circular Bloch line\nare formed, whereas in the second regime, spin waves propagate in a single\ncentral beam through the circular Bloch line. Phase-resolved $\\mu$BLS\nmeasurements reveal a phase shift upon transmission through the domain wall for\nboth regimes.

Based on\nthis assumption, a number of constraints on the abundance of ultralight PBHs\nhave been made. However, Hawking radiation has thus far not been verified\nexperimentally. It would, therefore, be of interest if constraints on\nultralight PBHs could be placed independent of the assumption of\nHawking-radiation. In this paper, we explore the possibility of probing these\nPBHs, within a narrow mass range, using gravitational-wave (GW) data from the\ntwo LIGO detectors. The idea is that large primordial curvature perturbations\nthat result in the formation of PBHs, would also generate GWs through\nnon-linear mode couplings. These induced GWs would produce a stochastic\nbackground. Specifically, we focus our attention on PBHs of mass range $\\sim\n10^{13} - 10^{15}$g for which the induced stochastic GW background peak falls\nin the sensitivity band of LIGO. We find that, for both narrow and broad\nGaussian PBH mass distributions, the corresponding GW background would be\ndetectable using presently available LIGO data, provided we neglect the\nexisting constraints on the abundance of PBHs, which are based on Hawking\nradiation. Furthermore, we find that these stochastic backgrounds would be\ndetectable in LIGO's third observing run, even after considering the existing\nconstraints on PBH abundance. A non-detection should enable us to constrain the\namplitude of primordial curvature perturbations as well as the abundance of\nultralight PBHs. We estimate that by the end of the third observing run,\nassuming non-detection, we should be able to place constraints that are orders\nof magnitude better than currently existing ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 May 2020 11:27:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Aug 2020 17:03:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-05"}

In\nparticular, it is shown that the radiative Q-factor explicitly depends on the\nmultipolar components of the quasistatic modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 May 2020 12:01:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Aug 2020 13:57:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-11"}

In this work we develop an\nalternative iterative scheme, where a new subset of objects is detected at each\niteration. Detected boxes from the previous iterations are passed to the\nnetwork at the following iterations to ensure that the same object would not be\ndetected twice. This iterative scheme can be applied to both one-stage and\ntwo-stage object detectors with just minor modifications of the training and\ninference procedures.

We develop novel goal\nrecognition approaches over imperfect domains models by leveraging and adapting\nexisting recognition approaches from the literature.

This enigmatic\ncoincidence has offered opportunities to investigate many-body interactions\nbetween trion, exciton and phonon and led to efficient excitonic anti-Stokes\nprocesses with the potential for laser refrigeration and energy harvesting. In\nthis study, we show that in WSe2 materials, the trion binding energy matches\ntwo phonon modes, the outofplane HP and the in-plane LO mode. In this respect,\nusing the Fermi golden rule together with the effective mass approximation, we\ninvestigate the rate of the population transfers between exciton and trion,\nmediated by a single phonon. We demonstrate that, while the absolute importance\nof the two phonon modes on the upconversion process strongly depend on the\nexperimental conditions such as the temperature and the dielectric environment\n(substrate), both modes lead to an up-conversion process on time scales in the\nrange of few picoseconds to sub-nanosecond, consistent with recents\nexperimental findings.

In a simplified numerical leg model, we studied the energy\ndissipation from viscous and Coulomb damping during vertical drops with\nground-level perturbations. A parallel spring-damper is engaged between\ntouch-down and mid-stance, and its damper auto-disengages during mid-stance and\ntakeoff. Our simulations indicate that an adjustable and viscous damper is\ndesired. In hardware we explored effective viscous damping and adjustability\nand quantified the dissipated energy. We tested two mechanical, leg-mounted\ndamping mechanisms; a commercial hydraulic damper, and a custom-made pneumatic\ndamper. The pneumatic damper exploits a rolling diaphragm with an adjustable\norifice, minimizing Coulomb damping effects while permitting adjustable\nresistance. Experimental results show that the leg-mounted, hydraulic damper\nexhibits the most effective viscous damping. Adjusting the orifice setting did\nnot result in substantial changes of dissipated energy per drop, unlike\nadjusting damping parameters in the numerical model.

We leverage the fact that different homeomorphic skeletons may be\nreduced to a common primal skeleton by a sequence of edge merging operations,\nwhich we refer to as skeletal pooling. Thus, our main technical contribution is\nthe introduction of novel differentiable convolution, pooling, and unpooling\noperators. These operators are skeleton-aware, meaning that they explicitly\naccount for the skeleton's hierarchical structure and joint adjacency, and\ntogether they serve to transform the original motion into a collection of deep\ntemporal features associated with the joints of the primal skeleton. In other\nwords, our operators form the building blocks of a new deep motion processing\nframework that embeds the motion into a common latent space, shared by a\ncollection of homeomorphic skeletons. Thus, retargeting can be achieved simply\nby encoding to, and decoding from this latent space. Our experiments show the\neffectiveness of our framework for motion retargeting, as well as motion\nprocessing in general, compared to existing approaches. Our approach is also\nquantitatively evaluated on a synthetic dataset that contains pairs of motions\napplied to different skeletons.

Most existing data-driven approaches are supervised and\nrely on paired data, where motions with the same content are performed in\ndifferent styles. In addition, these approaches are limited to transfer of\nstyles that were seen during training. In this paper, we present a novel\ndata-driven framework for motion style transfer, which learns from an unpaired\ncollection of motions with style labels, and enables transferring motion styles\nnot observed during training. Furthermore, our framework is able to extract\nmotion styles directly from videos, bypassing 3D reconstruction, and apply them\nto the 3D input motion. Our style transfer network encodes motions into two\nlatent codes, for content and for style, each of which plays a different role\nin the decoding (synthesis) process. While the content code is decoded into the\noutput motion by several temporal convolutional layers, the style code modifies\ndeep features via temporally invariant adaptive instance normalization (AdaIN).\nMoreover, while the content code is encoded from 3D joint rotations, we learn a\ncommon embedding for style from either 3D or 2D joint positions, enabling style\nextraction from videos. Our results are comparable to the state-of-the-art,\ndespite not requiring paired training data, and outperform other methods when\ntransferring previously unseen styles. To our knowledge, we are the first to\ndemonstrate style transfer directly from videos to 3D animations - an ability\nwhich enables one to extend the set of style examples far beyond motions\ncaptured by MoCap systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 May 2020 13:21:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-13"}

The amplitude of the ion-acoustic solitary wave after passage\nthrough the boundary changes in such a way that its value in the electron-ion\nplasma is greater than its value in the negative ion plasmas. An exception is\nthe case of a compressive ion-acoustic solitary wave propagating through the\nnegative ion plasma and having an amplitude exceeding the critical amplitude in\nthe electron-ion plasma.

We manage to prove the\nconjecture for cyclic groups of order $p^mq^n$, when one of the exponents is\n$\\leq6$ or when $p^{m-2}<q^4$, and also prove that a tiling subset of a cyclic\ngroup of order $p_1^mp_2\\dotsm p_n$ is spectral.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 May 2020 14:13:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 May 2020 07:26:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 22 Mar 2022 08:07:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-02"}

In\nthis study, we use three years of daily data from one of the biggest hospitals\nin Switzerland and focus on modelling the extremes of hospital visits from\npatients showing flu-like symptoms and the number of positive cases of flu. We\npropose employing a discrete Generalized Pareto distribution for the number of\npositive and negative cases, and a Generalized Pareto distribution for the odds\nof positive cases. Our modelling framework allows for the parameters of these\ndistributions to be linked to covariate effects, and for outlying observations\nto be dealt with via a robust estimation approach.

The Leidenfrost\npoint (LFP) was found to decrease with increase in the impact Weber number\n(based on velocity just before the impact) for fixed polymer (Polyacrylamide,\nPAAM) concentrations. Water droplets fragmented at very low Weber numbers\n(~22), whereas the polymer droplets resisted fragmentation at much higher Weber\nnumbers (~155). We also varied the polymer concentration and observed that till\n1000 ppm, the LFP was higher compared to water. This signifies that the effect\ncan be delayed by the use of elastic fluids. We have showed the possible role\nof elastic effects (manifested by the formation of long lasting filaments)\nduring retraction in the improvement of the LFP.

Similarly, for fixed polymer concentrations like 1000 and 1500 ppm,\nthe rebound height showed an increasing trend up to certain a certain Weber\nnumber and then decreased. This non-monotonic behaviour of rebound heights was\nattributed to the observed diversion of rebound kinetic energy to rotational\nenergy during the hovering phase.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 May 2020 14:32:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-17"}

While the QPO's period has no significant energy\ndependence, its fractional root-mean-square (rms) variability increases from 4%\nin 0.3-1 keV to 12% in 1-4 keV bands. An interesting phenomenon is that the QPO\nin 0.3-1 keV leads that in the 1-4 keV bands by 430 $\\pm$ 50 s with a high\ncoherence, opposite to the soft X-ray lag reported for the observation in 2007.\nWe speculate that the QPO has an intrinsic hard lag, while the previous\nreported soft lag is caused by the interference of stochastic variability.

The disease is thought to spread mainly from\nperson-to-person through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person\ncoughs, sneezes, or talks. The pathogen of COVID-19 is the severe acute\nrespiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It infects the cells binding\nto the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor (ACE2) which is expressed by\ncells throughout the airways as targets for cellular entry. Although the\nmajority of persons infected with SARS-CoV-2 experience symptoms of mild upper\nrespiratory tract infection, in some people infections of the peripheral\nairways result in severe, potentially fatal pneumonia. However, the induction\nof COVID-19 pneumonia requires that SARS-CoV-2 reaches the peripheral airways.\nWhile huge efforts have been made to understand the spread of the disease as\nwell as the pathogenesis following cellular entry, much less attention is paid\nhow SARS-CoV-2 from the environment reach the receptors of the target cells.\nThe aim of the present study is to characterize the deposition distribution of\nSARS-CoV-2 in the airways upon exposure to cough-generated aerosol. For this\npurpose, the Stochastic Lung Deposition Model has been applied. Aerosol size\ndistribution and breathing parameters were taken from the literature supposing\nnormal breathing through the nose.

It is an important scientific problem to\ndevelop probabilistic and dynamical techniques to estimate the probabilities of\nrare events accurately from limited data.
