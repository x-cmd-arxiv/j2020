Its positivity provides a stringent\ncriterion for physically reasonable response involving the second derivatives\nof the strain energy function. Also, an average (or secant) bulk modulus is\ndefined by comparing the current stress with the relative volume change. The\npositivity of this bulk modulus provides a physically reasonable response\ncriterion less stringent than the former. The concept of incremental bulk\nmodulus is extended to anisotropic elasticity. For states of uniaxial tension\nan incremental Poisson's ratio and an incremental Young's modulus are similarly\ndefined for nonlinear isotropic elasticity and have properties similar to those\nof the incremental bulk modulus. The incremental Poisson's ratios for the\nisotropic constraints of incompressibility, Bell, Ericksen, and constant area\nare considered. The incremental moduli are all evaluated for a specific example\nof the compressible neo-Hookean solid. Bounds on the ground state Lam\\'{e}\nelastic moduli, assumed positive, are given which are sufficient to guarantee\nthe positivity of the incremental bulk and Young's moduli for all strains.\nHowever, although the ground state Poisson's ratio is positive we find that the\nincremental Poisson's ratio becomes negative for large enough axial extensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 May 2020 21:44:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-12"}

Classically, whether or\nnot this contribution becomes important before the bounce depends on its\ninitial value, which can always be sufficiently fine tuned to make it\nirrelevant. However, vacuum quantum fluctuations inevitably provide a\nnon-vanishing source of anisotropic stress. In this work, we compute the\nminimum amount of shear that is obtained if one assumes that it vanishes\ninitially, but lets quantum fluctuations build it up. In practice, we consider\na massless test scalar field, and describe its quantum fluctuations by means of\nthe stochastic \"inflation\" (though here applied to a contracting phase)\nformalism. We find that, if the equation-of-state parameter of the contraction\nsatisfies $w>-1/9$, regardless of when the contracting phase is initiated, the\ntime at which the shear becomes sizeable is always when the Hubble scale\napproaches the Planck mass (which is also where the bounce is expected to take\nplace).

In the new method, a parameterized dictionary of candidate\nfunctions is constructed against the traditional expanded dictionary. The\nparameterized dictionary uses a function with variables to represent a series\nof functions. It accordingly has the ability to express functions in the\ncontinuous function space so that the dimension of the dictionary can be\nexponentially decreased. This is particularly important when an exhaustion of\ncandidate functions is needed to construct appropriate dictionary. The\nreconstruction of delay differential equation is such the case that each\npossible delay item should be considered as the basis to construct the\ndictionary and this naturally induces the curse of dimensionality.\nCorrespondingly, the parameterized dictionary uses a variable to model the\ndelay item so the curse disappears.

The search for ideal secret sharing schemes for some special\ninteresting families of multipartite access structures, has been carried out by\nmany authors. In this paper a new concept of study of ideal access structures\nis proposed. We do not consider special classes of access structures defined by\nimposing certain prescribed assumptions, but we investigate all access\nstructures obtained from uniform polymatroids using the method developed by\nFarr\\`as, Mart\\'i-Farr\\'e and Padr\\'o. They satisfy necessary condition to be\nideal, i.e., they are matroid ports. Moreover some objects in this family can\nbe useful for the applications of secret sharing. The choice of uniform\npolymatroids is motivated by the fact that each such polymatroid defines ideal\naccess structures. The method presented in this article is universal and can be\ncontinued with other classes of polymatroids in further similar studies. Here\nwe are especially interested in hierarchy of participants determined by the\naccess structure and we distinguish two main classes: they are compartmented\nand hierarchical access structures. The vast majority of papers discussing\nhierarchical access structures consider access structures which are compartment\nor totally hierarchical. The main results are summarized in Section 4, which\npresents situations where partial hierarchy properties may arise. In\nparticular, hierarchical orders of obtained structures are described. It is\nsurprising, that the hierarchical orders of access structures obtained from\nuniform polymatroids are flat, i.e., every chain has at most 2 elements. The\nideality of some families of hierarchical access structures is proved in\nSection 5.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 May 2020 20:38:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Jul 2021 18:40:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-26"}

Recent experiments revealed that the\nmechanical response of a crystal is very sensitive to both the presence of a\nquenched disorder in the sample and the orientation of the crystal. In this\nwork, we study the influence of disorder and crystal orientation on the large\nstrain response of a 2D FCC crystal with three active glide planes using a very\nsimple Eulerian plasticity model in the FE framework. Our numerical and\ntheoretical results on clean crystal pillars suggest that a single plane or\nmany gliding planes can be activated depending on the crystal orientation.\nWhile in the former case, the deformation is localized, leading to ductile\nrupture, in the latter, a complex interplay between active planes takes place,\nresulting in a more uniform deformation. The strain-localization can be avoided\nwhen inhomogeneities are engineered inside the crystal, or the crystal\norientation is altered because of the activation of multiple slip systems,\nresulting in a \"patchwork\" of the distribution of the slip systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 May 2020 20:38:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-12"}

More specifically, our research was motivated by preliminary\nobservations that the view profiles along time tend to present a piecewise\nlinear nature. A methodology was then delineated in order to identify the main\nsegments in the view profiles, which allowed several related measurements to be\nderived. In particular, we focused on the inclination and length of each\nsubsequent segment. Basic statistics indicated that the inclination can vary\nsubstantially along subsequent segments, while the segment lengths resulted\nmore stable. Complementary joint statistics analysis, considering pairwise\ncorrelations, provided further information about the properties of the views.\nIn order to better understand the view profiles, we performed respective\nmultivariate statistical analysis, including principal component analysis and\nhierarchical clustering.

Hence, the development of accurate forecasts is a valuable\nfield of research to further improve the efficiency of water utilities.\nFocusing on probabilistic multi-step-ahead forecasting, a time series model is\nintroduced, to capture typical autoregressive, calendar and seasonal effects,\nto account for time-varying variance, and to quantify the uncertainty and\npath-dependency of the water demand process. To deal with the high complexity\nof the water demand process a high-dimensional feature space is applied, which\nis efficiently tuned by an automatic shrinkage and selection operator (lasso).\nIt allows to obtain an accurate, simple interpretable and fast computable\nforecasting model, which is well suited for real-time applications. The\ncomplete probabilistic forecasting framework allows not only for simulating the\nmean and the marginal properties, but also the correlation structure between\nhours within the forecasting horizon. For practitioners, complete probabilistic\nmulti-step-ahead forecasts are of considerable relevance as they provide\nadditional information about the expected aggregated or cumulative water\ndemand, so that a statement can be made about the probability with which a\nwater storage capacity can guarantee the supply over a certain period of time.\nThis information allows to better control storage capacities and to better\nensure the smooth operation of pumps. To appropriately evaluate the forecasting\nperformance of the considered models, the energy score (ES) as a strictly\nproper multidimensional evaluation criterion, is introduced. The methodology is\napplied to the hourly water demand data of a German water supplier.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 May 2020 22:26:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-12"}

Works in the\ncurrent literature assume a fixed number of transmitters and receivers in the\nsystem. However, following the increase in communication networks density, it\nis interesting to investigate the performance of CF when the number of\ntransmitters is large.\n  In this work, we show that as the number of transmitters grows, CF becomes\ndegenerated, in the sense that a relay prefers to decode only one (strongest)\nuser instead of any other linear combination of the transmitted codewords,\ntreating the other users as noise. Moreover, the system's sum-rate tends to\nzero as well. This makes scheduling necessary in order to maintain the superior\nabilities CF provides. We thus examine the problem of scheduling for CF. We\nstart with insights on why good scheduling opportunities can be found. Then, we\nprovide an asymptotically optimal, polynomial-time scheduling algorithm and\nanalyze its performance.

In this article we first refute Gurevich's\nconjecture. For this we extend the seminal research of Blass, Gurevich and\nShelah on {\\em choiceless polynomial time} (CPT), which exploits deterministic\nAbstract State Machines (ASMs) supporting unbounded parallelism to capture the\nchoiceless fragment of PTIME. CPT is strictly included in PTIME. We observe\nthat choice is unavoidable, but that a restricted version suffices, which\nguarantees that the final result is independent from the choice. Such a version\nof polynomially bounded ASMs, which we call {\\em insignificant choice\npolynomial time} (ICPT) will indeed capture PTIME. Even more, insignificant\nchoice can be captured by ASMs with choice restricted to atoms such that a {\\em\nlocal insignificance condition} is satisfied. As this condition can be\nexpressed in the logic of non-deterministic ASMs, we obtain a logic capturing\nPTIME. Furthermore, using inflationary fixed-points we can capture problems in\nPTIME by fixed-point formulae in a fragment of the logic of non-deterministic\nASMs plus inflationary fixed-points. We use this result for our second\ncontribution showing that PTIME differs from NP. For the proof we build again\non the research on CPT first establishing a limitation on permutation classes\nof the sets that can be activated by an ICPT computation. We then prove an\ninseparability theorem, which characterises classes of structures that cannot\nbe separated by the logic.

The task of image clustering naturally\nrequires good feature representations to capture the distribution of the data\nand subsequently differentiate data points from one another. Often these two\naspects are dealt with independently and thus traditional feature learning\nalone does not suffice in partitioning the data meaningfully. Variational\nAutoencoders (VAEs) naturally lend themselves to learning data distributions in\na latent space. Since we wish to efficiently discriminate between different\nclusters in the data, we propose a method based on VAEs where we use a Gaussian\nMixture prior to help cluster the images accurately. We jointly learn the\nparameters of both the prior and the posterior distributions. Our method\nrepresents a true Gaussian Mixture VAE. This way, our method simultaneously\nlearns a prior that captures the latent distribution of the images and a\nposterior to help discriminate well between data points. We also propose a\nnovel reparametrization of the latent space consisting of a mixture of discrete\nand continuous variables. One key takeaway is that our method generalizes\nbetter across different datasets without using any pre-training or learnt\nmodels, unlike existing methods, allowing it to be trained from scratch in an\nend-to-end manner. We verify our efficacy and generalizability experimentally\nby achieving state-of-the-art results among unsupervised methods on a variety\nof datasets.

Although there are many studies in Odd-Even staggering (OES) of nuclear\nmasses, but the research on nuclear masses by using the systematicness of OES\nis indeed very few. Our purpose in this paper is to describe an empirical\nformula for Odd-Even staggering of nuclear masses that can be useful in\ndescribing and predicting nuclear masses. We empirically obtained the formula\nof odd-Z (odd-N) nuclei and even-Z (even-N) nuclei based on studying the OES of\nnuclear masses (AME2012). With the proton (neutron) empirical pairing gap from\nthe OES of the binding energies and AME2012 database, the root-mean-square\ndeviation of even-Z nuclei and odd-Z nuclei that we have successfully obtained\n208 keV and 238 keV, respectively. The RMSD of even-N nuclei and odd-N nuclei\nis 222 keV and 240 keV. The result shows that our predicted values are compared\nwell with values in AME2016, and some predicted values agree better with the\nexperimental values. These results demonstrate that our empirical formulas have\ngood accuracy and reliability. Another advantage of these formulas is that they\nuse less known nuclear masses to predict unknown nuclear masses. In addition,\nthis paper also uses BP neural network to study proton Odd-Even staggering of\nnuclear masses (even-Z and odd-Z nuclei) and neutron Odd-Even staggering of\nnuclear masses (even-N and odd-N nuclei). The RMSD of even-Z and odd-Z nuclei\nis 141 keV and 159 keV; the RMSD of even-N and odd-N nuclei is 150 keV and 160\nkeV. The results show that the RMSD of nuclear masses based on neural network\n60-80 keV decrease than that based on empirical formula (the accuracy is\nincreased by about 32%). Accurate nuclear mass is helpful to the research of\nnuclear physics, nuclear technology and astrophysics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 May 2020 12:17:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-12"}

We briefly recap the main features of this story and then discuss its\napplications as a tool to explore the QCD phase structure. The most appealing\napplication is the possibility of getting the results on the QCD phase diagram\nat large baryon density. Taking the idea from large $1/N_{c}$ universalities it\nwas argued that the scenario of circumventing the sign problem with the help of\ndualities seems plausible. It is also discussed that there is a persistent\nproblem about whether there should be catalysis or anti-catalysis of chiral\nsymmetry breaking by chiral imbalance. One can probably say that the issue is\nsettled after lattice results (first principle approach), where the catalysis\nwas observed.

This system comprises six independently\noperated unsteady minijet actuators, two hot-wire sensors placed in the jet,\nand genetic programming for the unsupervised learning of a near-optimal control\nlaw. The ansatz of this law includes multi-frequency open-loop forcing,\nsensor-feedback and nonlinear combinations thereof. Mixing performance is\nquantified by the decay rate of the centreline mean velocity of jet.\nIntriguingly, the learning process of AI control discovers the classical\nforcings, i.e. axisymmetric, helical and flapping achievable from conventional\ncontrol techniques, one by one in the order of increased performance, and\nfinally converges to a hitherto unexplored forcing. Careful examination of the\ncontrol landscape unveils typical control laws, generated in the learning\nprocess, and their evolutions. The best AI forcing produces a complex turbulent\nflow structure that is characterized by periodically generated mushroom\nstructures, helical motion and oscillating jet column, all enhancing the mixing\nrate and vastly outperforming others. Being never reported before, this flow\nstructure is examined in various aspects, including the velocity spectra, mean\nand fluctuating velocity fields and their downstream evolution, and flow\nvisualization images in three orthogonal planes, all compared with other\nclassical flow structures. Along with the knowledge of the minijet-produced\nflow and its effect on the initial condition of the main jet, these aspects\ncast valuable insight into the physics behind the highly effective mixing of\nthis newly found flow structure.

Precise estimation of the\nprobabilistic distribution of the codes plays a vital role in the performance.\nHowever, existing deep learning based entropy modeling methods generally assume\nthe latent codes are statistically independent or depend on some side\ninformation or local context, which fails to take the global similarity within\nthe context into account and thus hinder the accurate entropy estimation. To\naddress this issue, we propose a non-local operation for context modeling by\nemploying the global similarity within the context. Specifically, we first\nintroduce the proxy similarity functions and spatial masks to handle the\nmissing reference problem in context modeling. Then, we combine the local and\nthe global context via a non-local attention block and employ it in masked\nconvolutional networks for entropy modeling. The entropy model is further\nadopted as the rate loss in a joint rate-distortion optimization to guide the\ntraining of the analysis transform and the synthesis transform network in\ntransforming coding framework. Considering that the width of the transforms is\nessential in training low distortion models, we finally produce a U-Net block\nin the transforms to increase the width with manageable memory consumption and\ntime complexity. Experiments on Kodak and Tecnick datasets demonstrate the\nsuperiority of the proposed context-based non-local attention block in entropy\nmodeling and the U-Net block in low distortion compression against the existing\nimage compression standards and recent deep image compression models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 May 2020 13:28:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-12"}

To address this issue, we propose a domain\nadaptation paradigm, which consists of an image translation module and two\nimage dehazing modules. Specifically, we first apply a bidirectional\ntranslation network to bridge the gap between the synthetic and real domains by\ntranslating images from one domain to another. And then, we use images before\nand after translation to train the proposed two image dehazing networks with a\nconsistency constraint. In this phase, we incorporate the real hazy image into\nthe dehazing training via exploiting the properties of the clear image (e.g.,\ndark channel prior and image gradient smoothing) to further improve the domain\nadaptivity. By training image translation and dehazing network in an end-to-end\nmanner, we can obtain better effects of both image translation and dehazing.\nExperimental results on both synthetic and real-world images demonstrate that\nour model performs favorably against the state-of-the-art dehazing algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 May 2020 13:54:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-12"}

We apply these new formulas to selected cases and\ndemonstrate that the Fermi sea and Fermi surface contributions can be uniquely\naddressed with our symmetrized approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 May 2020 14:31:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-12"}

Despite the availability of many libraries, data sets with\nmixed data types require intensive pre-processing steps, and it remains a\nchallenge to describe the relationships between variables. The data\nunderstanding phase is an important step in the data mining process, however,\nwithout making any assumptions on the data, the search space is\nsuper-exponential in the number of variables. Methods: We propose graphical\nhypergeometric networks (HNet), a method to test associations across variables\nfor significance using statistical inference. The aim is to determine a network\nusing only the significant associations in order to shed light on the complex\nrelationships across variables. HNet processes raw unstructured data sets and\noutputs a network that consists of (partially) directed or undirected edges\nbetween the nodes (i.e., variables). To evaluate the accuracy of HNet, we used\nwell known data sets and in addition generated data sets with known ground\ntruth. The performance of HNet is compared to Bayesian structure learning.\nResults: We demonstrate that HNet showed high accuracy and performance in the\ndetection of node links. In the case of the Alarm data set we can demonstrate\non average an MCC score of 0.33 + 0.0002 (P<1x10-6), whereas Bayesian structure\nlearning resulted in an average MCC score of 0.52 + 0.006 (P<1x10-11), and\nrandomly assigning edges resulted in a MCC score of 0.004 + 0.0003 (P=0.49).\nConclusions: HNet can process raw unstructured data sets, allows analysis of\nmixed data types, it easily scales up in number of variables, and allows\ndetailed examination of the detected associations.

In peer review it is not required for this\nobjectivity to have correspondence to an outside world, instead it is enough\nfor it to operate inside the \"rules\" of the community. Neither is the\nobjectivity here empirical in the sense of using data about the scientific\nproblem in question. Rather, the objectivity is one of judgment, cleaving to\nthe epistemological standards of a community that are formed by background\nassumptions and beliefs. As a consequence, we highlight the role of\nsubjectivity in what is usually taken as a practice of objectivity, and arrive\nat the insight that objectivity is not defined by one core value, but a balance\nof transparency, confidentiality, trust, representation, and living up to\ncommunity standards. As such, objectivity in peer review is a highly specific\nsense of the term that is not reducible to that used in other aspects of\nscientific practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 May 2020 15:48:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-12"}

We adopt the Wiener-Hopf method\nto compute the Green function for a cracked half plane, a background for the\nperturbed half plane. We rigorously show that the Green function asymptotically\nsatisfies a universal-direction SRC (uSRC) and radiates purely outgoing at\ninfinity. This helps to propose an implicit transparent boundary condition for\nthe scattered wave, by either a cylindrical incident wave due to a line source\nor a plane incident wave. Then, a well-posedness theory is established via an\nassociated variational formulation. The theory reveals that the scattered wave,\npost-subtracting a known wave field, satisfies the same uSRC so that its\nfar-field pattern is accessible theoretically. For a plane-wave incidence,\nasymptotic analysis shows that merely subtracting reflected plane waves, due to\nnon-uniform heights of the step-like surface at infinity, from the scattered\nwave in respective regions produces a discontinuous wave satisfying the uSRC as\nwell. Numerically, we adopt a previously developed perfectly-matched-layer\n(PML) boundary-integral-equation method to solve the problem.

Motivated by observations of sexual reproduction in\nseemingly-asexual species, the Knight-Darwin Law states that it is impossible\nfor one organism to asexually produce another, which asexually produces\nanother, and so on forever: that any sequence of organisms (each one a child of\nthe previous) must contain occasional multi-parent organisms, or must\nterminate.

We vary the\nchemical structure of thiol spacers to probe the effects of concentration and\nthe local environment of ester groups on the macroscopic elastic-plastic\ntransition. The thermal activation energy of transesterification bond exchange\nis determined for each chemical structure, and for a varying concentration of\ncatalyst, establishing the conditions for the optimal, and for the suppressed\nbond exchange.

A critical element involves essential workforce management since\ncurrent protocols recommend release from duty for symptomatic individuals,\nincluding essential personnel. Testing capacity is also problematic in several\ncountries, where diagnosis demand outnumbers available local testing capacity.\nThis work describes a machine learning model derived from hemogram exam data\nperformed in symptomatic patients and how they can be used to predict qRT-PCR\ntest results. Methods: A Naive-Bayes model for machine learning is proposed for\nhandling different scarcity scenarios, including managing symptomatic essential\nworkforce and absence of diagnostic tests. Hemogram result data was used to\npredict qRT-PCR results in situations where the latter was not performed, or\nresults are not yet available. Adjusts in assumed prior probabilities allow\nfine-tuning of the model, according to actual prediction context. Proposed\nmodels can predict COVID-19 qRT-PCR results in symptomatic individuals with\nhigh accuracy, sensitivity and specificity. Data assessment can be performed in\nan individual or simultaneous basis, according to desired outcome. Based on\nhemogram data and background scarcity context, resource distribution is\nsignificantly optimized when model-based patient selection is observed,\ncompared to random choice. The model can help manage testing deficiency and\nother critical circumstances. Machine learning models can be derived from\nwidely available, quick, and inexpensive exam data in order to predict qRT-PCR\nresults used in COVID-19 diagnosis. These models can be used to assist\nstrategic decision-making in resource scarcity scenarios, including personnel\nshortage, lack of medical resources, and testing insufficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 May 2020 01:45:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-21"}
