An alternative to induce long-range ferromagnetism (FM)\nin TMDs is by introducing magnetic dopants to form a dilute magnetic\nsemiconductor. Enhancing ferromagnetism in these semiconductors not only\nrepresents a key step towards modern TMD-based spintronics, but also enables\nexploration of new and exciting dimensionality-driven magnetic phenomena. To\nthis end, we show tunable ferromagnetism at room temperature and a thermally\ninduced spin flip (TISF) in monolayers of V-doped WSe2. As vanadium\nconcentrations increase within the WSe2 monolayers the saturation magnetization\nincreases, and it is optimal at ~4at.% vanadium; the highest doping/alloying\nlevel ever achieved for V-doped WSe2 monolayers. The TISF occurs at ~175 K and\nbecomes more pronounced upon increasing the temperature towards room\ntemperature. We demonstrate that TISF can be manipulated by changing the\nvanadium concentration within the WSe2 monolayers. We attribute TISF to the\nmagnetic field and temperature dependent flipping of the nearest W-site\nmagnetic moments that are antiferromagnetically coupled to the V magnetic\nmoments in the ground state. This is fully supported by a recent spin-polarized\ndensity functional theory calculation. Our findings pave the way for the\ndevelopment of novel spintronic and valleytronic nanodevices based on\natomically thin magnetic semiconductors and stimulate further studies in this\nrapidly expanding research field of 2D magnetism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 May 2020 17:09:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-10"}

In cycle-GAN, an inverse transformation was\nimplemented between the INU uncorrected and corrected MRI images to constrain\nthe model through forcing the calculation of both an INU corrected MRI and a\nsynthetic corrected MRI.

The study of Latin squares goes back more than 200 years to the work of\nEuler. One of the most famous open problems in this area is a conjecture of\nRyser-Brualdi-Stein from 60s which says that every Latin square of order\n$n\\times n$ contains a transversal of order $n-1$. In this paper we prove the\nexistence of a transversal of order $n-O(\\log{n}/\\log{\\log{n}})$, improving the\ncelebrated bound of $n-O(\\log^2n)$ by Hatami and Shor. Our approach (different\nfrom that of Hatami-Shor) is quite general and gives several other applications\nas well.

A fundamental question is to understand how\nthe difficulty of the problem scales as the horizon increases. Here the natural\nmeasure of sample complexity is a normalized one: we are interested in the\nnumber of episodes it takes to provably discover a policy whose value is\n$\\varepsilon$ near to that of the optimal value, where the value is measured by\nthe normalized cumulative reward in each episode. In a COLT 2018 open problem,\nJiang and Agarwal conjectured that, for tabular, episodic reinforcement\nlearning problems, there exists a sample complexity lower bound which exhibits\na polynomial dependence on the horizon -- a conjecture which is consistent with\nall known sample complexity upper bounds. This work refutes this conjecture,\nproving that tabular, episodic reinforcement learning is possible with a sample\ncomplexity that scales only logarithmically with the planning horizon. In other\nwords, when the values are appropriately normalized (to lie in the unit\ninterval), this results shows that long horizon RL is no more difficult than\nshort horizon RL, at least in a minimax sense. Our analysis introduces two\nideas: (i) the construction of an $\\varepsilon$-net for optimal policies whose\nlog-covering number scales only logarithmically with the planning horizon, and\n(ii) the Online Trajectory Synthesis algorithm, which adaptively evaluates all\npolicies in a given policy class using sample complexity that scales with the\nlog-covering number of the given policy class.

We show that the\ngeneralized (asymmetric) E- and (symmetric) T-models exhibit identical\ntwo-field dynamics during inflation for a wide range of initial conditions. The\nresulting motion can be decomposed in two approximately single-field segments\nconnected by a sharp turn in field-space. The details of preheating can\nnevertheless be different. For the T-model one main mass-scale dominates the\nevolution of fluctuations of the spectator field, whereas for the E-model, a\ncompeting mass-scale emerges due to the steepness of the potential away from\nthe inflationary plateau, leading to different contributions to parametric\nresonance for small and large wave-numbers. Our linear multi-field analysis of\nfluctuations indicates that for highly curved manifolds, both the E- and\nT-models preheat almost instantaneously. For massless fields this is always due\nto efficient tachyonic amplification of the spectator field, making\nsingle-field results inaccurate. Interestingly, there is a parameter window\ncorresponding to $r={\\cal O}(10^{-5})$ and massive fields, where the preheating\nbehavior is qualitatively and quantitatively different for symmetric and\nasymmetric potentials. In that case, the E-model can completely preheat due to\nself-resonance for values of the curvature where preheating in the T-model is\ninefficient. This provides a first distinguishing feature between models that\notherwise behave identically, both at the single-field and multi-field level.\nFinally, we discuss how one can describe multi-field preheating on a hyperbolic\nmanifold by identifying the relevant mass-scales that control the growth of\ninflaton and spectator fluctuations, which can be applied to any\n$\\alpha$-attractor model and beyond.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 May 2020 17:57:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-04"}

Such challenges can be potentially resolved if a\nrapidly-rotating Wolf-Rayet star is located at the heart of the system,\nimplicating Apep as a Galactic progenitor system to long-duration gamma-ray\nbursts. One of the difficulties in interpreting the dynamics of Apep is that\nthe spectral composition of the stars in the system was unclear. Here we\npresent visual to near-infrared spectra that demonstrate that the central\ncomponent of Apep is composed of two classical Wolf-Rayet stars of carbon-\n(WC8) and nitrogen-sequence (WN4-6b) subtypes.

Since\nthe expansion velocity of the dust plume is significantly smaller than either\nof the measured terminal velocities, we explore the suggestion that one of the\nWolf-Rayet winds is anisotropic.

Recent hydrodynamical\nsimulations show that (i) discs can break into distinct planes when the\namplitude of an imposed warp is sufficiently high and the viscosity\nsufficiently low, and that (ii) discs can tear up into discrete rings when an\ninitially planar disc is subject to a forced precession. Previously, we\ninvestigated the local stability of isolated, Keplerian, warped discs in order\nto understand the physics causing an accretion disc to break into distinct\nplanes, finding that anti-diffusion of the warp amplitude is the underlying\ncause. Here, we explore the behaviour of this instability in disc regions where\nthe rotation profile deviates from Keplerian. We find that at small warp\namplitudes non-Keplerian rotation can stabilize the disc by increasing the\ncritical warp amplitude for instability, while at large warp amplitudes\nnon-Keplerian rotation can lead to an increased growth rate for discs that are\nunstable. Tidal effects on discs in binary systems are typically weak enough\nsuch that the disc remains close to Keplerian rotation. However, the inner\nregions of discs around black holes are strongly affected, with the smallest\nradius at which the disc can break into discrete planes being a function of the\nblack hole spin. We suggest that interpreting observed frequencies in the power\nspectra of light curves from accreting compact objects as nodal and apsidal\nprecession of discrete orbits requires an instability that can break the disc\ninto discrete rings such as the one explored here.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 May 2020 18:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-13"}

Only two scalar\ntriplets and one singlet are necessary and sufficient to break the symmetries\ndynamically via the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism. With the introduction of an\nAbelian discrete symmetry and assuming a natural hierarchy among the vacuum\nexpectation values of the neutral scalar fields, we show that all particles in\nthe model can get phenomenologically consistent masses.

In this self-organizing setting, containers\ncan autonomously place bids on transport services in a spot market setting.\nHowever, for individual containers it may be difficult to learn good bidding\npolicies due to limited observations. By sharing information and costs between\none another, smart containers can jointly learn bidding policies, even though\nsimultaneously competing for the same transport capacity. We replicate this\nbehavior by learning stochastic bidding policies in a semi-cooperative multi\nagent setting. To this end, we develop a reinforcement learning algorithm based\non the policy gradient framework. Numerical experiments show that sharing\nsolely bids and acceptance decisions leads to stable bidding policies.\nAdditional system information only marginally improves performance; individual\njob properties suffice to place appropriate bids. Furthermore, we find that\ncarriers may have incentives not to share information with the smart\ncontainers. The experiments give rise to several directions for follow-up\nresearch, in particular the interaction between smart containers and transport\nservices in self-organizing logistics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 May 2020 18:37:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-05"}

The mathematical description of such a\ntimecrystalline spontaneous symmetry breaking builds on concepts of equivariant\nMorse theory in the space of Hamiltonian flows. As an example we analyze a\ngeneral family of timecrystalline Hamiltonians that is designed to model\npolygonal, piecewise linear closed strings. The vertices correspond to the\nlocations of pointlike interaction centers; the string is akin a chain of\natoms, that are joined together by covalent bonds, modeled by the links of the\nstring.

The early Moon may have been captured into the\nevection resonance, occurring when the lunar perigee precession period equals\none year. It has been proposed that after a high-angular momentum giant impact,\nevection removed the angular momentum excess from the Earth-Moon pair and\ntransferred it to Earth's orbit about the Sun. However, prior N-body\nintegrations suggest this result depends on the tidal model and chosen tidal\nparameters.

While the Moon\nis in resonance the lunar longitude of perigee librates, and if tidal evolution\nexcites the libration amplitude sufficiently, escape from resonance occurs. The\nangular momentum drain produced by formal evection depends on how long the\nresonance is maintained. We estimate that resonant escape occurs early, leading\nto only a small reduction (~few to 10%) in the Earth-Moon system angular\nmomentum.

Despite the success\nof existing studies in conventional supervised document classification, they\nare less concerned with two real problems: (1) the presence of metadata: in\nmany domains, text is accompanied by various additional information such as\nauthors and tags. Such metadata serve as compelling topic indicators and should\nbe leveraged into the categorization framework; (2) label scarcity: labeled\ntraining samples are expensive to obtain in some cases, where categorization\nneeds to be performed using only a small set of annotated data. In recognition\nof these two challenges, we propose MetaCat, a minimally supervised framework\nto categorize text with metadata. Specifically, we develop a generative process\ndescribing the relationships between words, documents, labels, and metadata.\nGuided by the generative model, we embed text and metadata into the same\nsemantic space to encode heterogeneous signals.

However, it is very difficult to automatically search these\nsamples from the massive and high-dimensional datasets and systematically\nevaluate them. The DoPS, our previous work [2], provided a search method of\nrare spectra with double-peaked profiles from massive and high-dimensional data\nof LAMOST survey. The identification of the results is mainly depended on\nvisually inspection by astronomers. In this paper, as a follow-up study, a new\nlattice structure named SVM-Lattice is designed based on SVM(Support Vector\nMachine) and FCL(Formal Concept Lattice) and particularly applied in the\nrecognition and evaluation of rare spectra with double-peaked profiles. First,\neach node in the SVM-Lattice structure contains two components: the intents are\ndefined by the support vectors trained by the spectral samples with the\nspecific characteristics, and the relevant extents are all the positive samples\nclassified by the support vectors. The hyperplanes can be extracted from every\nlattice node and used as classifiers to search targets by categories. A\ngeneralization and specialization relationship is expressed between the layers,\nand higher layers indicate higher confidence of targets. Then, including a\nSVM-Lattice building algorithm, a pruning algorithm based on association rules,\nand an evaluation algorithm, the supporting algorithms are provided and\nanalysed. Finally, for the recognition and evaluation of spectra with\ndouble-peaked profiles, several data sets from LAMOST survey are used as\nexperimental dataset. The results exhibit good consistency with traditional\nmethods, more detailed and accurate evaluations of classification results, and\nhigher searching efficiency than other similar methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 May 2020 01:56:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-05"}

For that, the millimeter wave (mmWave)\ncommunication has been emerging as a very promising solution. However,\nincorporating the mmWave into ITS is particularly challenging due to the high\nmobility of vehicles and the inherent sensitivity of mmWave beams to dynamic\nblockages. This article addresses these problems by developing an optimal beam\nassociation framework for mmWave vehicular networks under high mobility.\nSpecifically, we use the semi-Markov decision process to capture the dynamics\nand uncertainty of the environment. The Q-learning algorithm is then often used\nto find the optimal policy. However, Q-learning is notorious for its\nslow-convergence. Instead of adopting deep reinforcement learning structures\n(like most works in the literature), we leverage the fact that there are\nusually multiple vehicles on the road to speed up the learning process. To that\nend, we develop a lightweight yet very effective parallel Q-learning algorithm\nto quickly obtain the optimal policy by simultaneously learning from various\nvehicles.

Intrusion detection systems (IDSs) are important devices that can\nmitigate the threats by detecting malicious behaviors. Furthermore, the\ncollaborations among vehicles in VANETs can improve the detection accuracy by\ncommunicating their experiences between nodes. To this end, distributed machine\nlearning is a suitable framework for the design of scalable and implementable\ncollaborative detection algorithms over VANETs. One fundamental barrier to\ncollaborative learning is the privacy concern as nodes exchange data among\nthem. A malicious node can obtain sensitive information of other nodes by\ninferring from the observed data. In this paper, we propose a\nprivacy-preserving machine-learning based collaborative IDS (PML-CIDS) for\nVANETs. The proposed algorithm employs the alternating direction method of\nmultipliers (ADMM) to a class of empirical risk minimization (ERM) problems and\ntrains a classifier to detect the intrusions in the VANETs.

Moreover, investigating the bond lengths in\nthe system, it is concluded that the higher epoxide percentage leads to an\nincrease in the length of single and hybrid resonance bonds leading to an\noverall deterioration of the mechanical properties of GO samples. Additionally,\nour results demonstrate that high concentration of functional groups can lead\nto a negative Poisson ratio. Increasing the amount of hydroxyl groups shows the\nsame declining effect on the Young modulus. In a graphene system containing\nboth epoxide and hydroxyl groups, it is deduced that a higher percentage of the\nformer can result in a higher residual strain because of the formation of more\nripples within the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 May 2020 05:42:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-03"}

However, the experiments counting the number of decayed\nneutrons and produced protons have a disagreement. This discrepancy suggests\nthat neutrons might have an exotic decay to a Dark Sector (DS). In this paper,\nwe explore a scenario where neutrons decay to a dark Dirac fermion $\\chi$ and a\nnon-abelian dark gauge boson $W'$. We discuss the cosmological implications of\nthis scenario assuming DS particles are produced via freeze-in. In our proposed\nscenario, DS has three portals with the SM sector: (1) the fermion portal\ncoming from the mixing of the neutron with $\\chi$, (2) a scalar portal, and (3)\na non-renormalizable kinetic mixing between photon and dark gauge bosons which\ninduces a vector portal between the two sectors. We show that neither the\nfermion portal nor the scalar portal should contribute to the production of the\nparticles in the early universe. Specifically, we argue that the maximum\ntemperature of the universe must be low enough to prevent the production of\n$\\chi$ in the early universe. In this paper, we rely on the vector portal to\nconnect the two sectors, and we discuss the phenomenological bounds on the\nmodel. The main constraints come from ensuring the right relic abundance of\ndark matter and evading the neutron star bounds. When dark gauge boson is very\nlight, measurements of the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis impose a stringent\nconstraint as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 May 2020 05:55:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-19"}

This is mostly due to positive users\nhaving more friends. We identify five sentiment paradoxes at different network\nlevels ranging from triads to large-scale communities. Empirical and\ntheoretical evidence are provided to validate the existence of such sentiment\nparadoxes. By investigating the relationships between the sentiment paradox and\nother well-developed network paradoxes, i.e., friendship paradox and activity\nparadox, we find that user sentiments are positively correlated to their number\nof friends but rarely to their social activity. Finally, we demonstrate how\nsentiment paradoxes can be used to predict user sentiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 May 2020 07:09:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-05"}

The high crest factor of such trains can be extremely\nburdensome for the transmitter hardware, and it makes the pulse trains easily\ndetectable even at very low signal-to-noise ratios. In addition, it may appear\nthat sharing the wideband channel by multiple users would require explicit\nallocation of the pulse arrival times for each sub-channel, which would be\nimpractical in most cases. On the other hand, messaging by wideband pulse\ntrains has many appealing features. Among those are the ease of synchronous as\nwell as asynchronous pulse detection, and on-the-fly channel reconfigurability\n(e.g. changing the spreading factor). Favorably, the crest factor of a pulse\ntrain, as well as its apparent temporal and amplitude structure, can be easily,\nand reversibly, controlled by simple linear filtering. For example, a\ntransmitted pulse train can be made statistically indistinguishable from the\nGaussian component of the channel noise (e.g. the thermal noise) observed in\nthe same spectral band, while the received signal will be the designed\nhigh-crest-factor wideband pulse train. In this paper, we utilize the so-called\npulse pileup effect to perform such reversible control of the pulse train\nstructure, enabling a wider use of this approach for synthesis of robust\nlow-SNR covert communication links.

For instance, some GRBs show an internal\nX-ray plateau followed by very steep decay, which is difficult to be\ninterpreted within the framework of a black hole (BH) central engine, but are\nconsistent within a rapidly spinning magnetar engine picture. The very steep\ndecay at the end of the plateau suggests a sudden cessation of the central\nengine, which is explained as the collapse of a supra-massive magnetar into a\nblack hole when it spins down. Here we propose that some additional evidence,\nsuch as a second X-ray plateau feature would show up, if the fall-back\naccretion could activate the newborn BH and sufficient energy could be\ntransferred from the newborn BH to the GRB blast wave. With a systematic data\nanalysis for all long GRBs, we find three candidates in \\emph{Swift} sample,\ni.e., GRBs 070802, 090111, and 120213A, whose X-ray afterglow light curves\ncontain two plateaus, with the first one being an internal plateau. We find\nthat in a fairly loose and reasonable parameter space, the second X-ray plateau\ndata for all 3 GRBs could be well interpreted with our proposed model.

A seizure can be\ncharacterised as a deviation of neural activity from a stable dynamical regime,\ni.e. one in which signals fluctuate only within a limited range. In silico\ntreatments of neural activity are an important tool for understanding how the\nbrain can achieve stability, as well as how pathology can lead to seizures and\npotential strategies for mitigating instabilities, e.g. via external\nstimulation. Here, we demonstrate that the (neuronal) state equation used in\nDynamic Causal Modelling generalises to a Fokker-Planck formalism when\npropagation of neuronal activity along structural connections is considered.\nUsing the Jacobian of this generalised state equation, we show that an\ninitially unstable system can be rendered stable via a reduction in diffusivity\n(i.e., connectivity that disperses neuronal fluctuations). We show, for neural\nsystems prone to epileptic seizures, that such a reduction can be achieved via\nexternal stimulation. Specifically, we show that this stimulation should be\napplied in such a way as to temporarily mirror epileptic activity in the areas\nadjoining an affected brain region - thus 'fighting seizures with seizures'. We\noffer proof of principle using simulations based on functional neuroimaging\ndata collected from patients with idiopathic generalised epilepsy, in which we\nsuccessfully suppress pathological activity in a distinct sub-network.

Humans have to perform several times over a\nlong term to show embodied and social interaction behaviors to robots or\nlearning systems.

The uncertainty problem leads\nto inaccurate location predictions and fuzziness in scale estimations. DroTrack\nsolves such issues by discovering the dependency between object representation\nand motion geometry. We implement an effective object segmentation based on\nFuzzy C Means (FCM). We incorporate the spatial information into the membership\nfunction to cluster the most discriminative segments.

In contrast to other electrical\napproaches, the underlying geometric blockage effect provides a robust and\nsensitive signal, which is straightforward to interpret without electrical\nmodels.

Most of them are technically demanding due to\nthe (hard to avoid) use of negative drift theorems -- general results which\ntranslate an expected progress away from the target into a high hitting time.\n  We propose a simple negative drift theorem for multiplicative drift scenarios\nand show that it can simplify existing analyses. We discuss in more detail\nLehre's (PPSN 2010) \\emph{negative drift in populations} method, one of the\nmost general tools to prove lower bounds on the runtime of non-elitist\nmutation-based evolutionary algorithms for discrete search spaces. Together\nwith other arguments, we obtain an alternative and simpler proof, which also\nstrengthens and simplifies this method. In particular, now only three of the\nfive technical conditions of the previous result have to be verified. The lower\nbounds we obtain are explicit instead of only asymptotic. This allows to\ncompute concrete lower bounds for concrete algorithms, but also enables us to\nshow that super-polynomial runtimes appear already when the reproduction rate\nis only a $(1 - \\omega(n^{-1/2}))$ factor below the threshold.

Perceptual Computing (Per C), a well known computing\nwith words (CWW) approach, and its various applications have nicely exploited\nthis advantage. This paper reports a novel Per C based approach for student\nstrategy evaluation. Examinations are generally oriented to test the subject\nknowledge of students. The number of questions that they are able to solve\naccurately judges success rates of students in the examinations. However, we\nfeel that not only the solutions of questions, but also the strategy adopted\nfor finding those solutions are equally important. More marks should be awarded\nto a student, who solves a question with a better strategy compared to a\nstudent, whose strategy is relatively not that good. Furthermore, the students\nstrategy can be taken as a measure of his or her learning outcome as perceived\nby a faculty member. This can help to identify students, whose learning\noutcomes are not good, and, thus, can be provided with any relevant help, for\nimprovement. The main contribution of this paper is to illustrate the use of\nCWW for student strategy evaluation and present a comparison of the\nrecommendations generated by different CWW approaches. CWW provides us with two\nmajor advantages. First, it generates a numeric score for the overall\nevaluation of strategy adopted by a student in the examination. This enables\ncomparison and ranking of the students based on their performances. Second, a\nlinguistic evaluation describing the student strategy is also obtained from the\nsystem. Both these numeric score and linguistic recommendation are together\nused to assess the quality of a students strategy.

By minimizing the close physical contact\namong people, we can reduce the chances of catching the virus and spreading it\nacross the community. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive survey on how\nemerging technologies, e.g., wireless and networking, artificial intelligence\n(AI) can enable, encourage, and even enforce social distancing practice. To\nthat end, we first provide a comprehensive background of social distancing\nincluding basic concepts, measurements, models, and propose various practical\nsocial distancing scenarios. We then discuss enabling wireless technologies\nwhich are especially effective and can be widely adopted in practice to keep\ndistance, encourage, and enforce social distancing in general. After that,\nother emerging and related technologies such as machine learning, computer\nvision, thermal, ultrasound, etc., are introduced. These technologies open many\nnew solutions and directions to deal with problems in social distancing, e.g.,\nsymptom prediction, detection and monitoring quarantined people, and contact\ntracing. Finally, we provide important open issues and challenges (e.g.,\nprivacy-preserving, scheduling, and incentive mechanisms) in implementing\nsocial distancing in practice. As an example, instead of reacting with ad-hoc\nresponses to COVID-19-like pandemics in the future, smart infrastructures\n(e.g., next-generation wireless systems like 6G, smart home/building, smart\ncity, intelligent transportation systems) should incorporate a pandemic mode in\nits standard architecture/design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 May 2020 23:21:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 22 Sep 2020 23:19:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-24"}

However, the most prosperous states are the highest emitters\nof greenhouse gases (specially, CO2). This indicates a strong relationship\nbetween gaseous emissions and the gross domestic product (GDP) of the states.\nSuch a relationship is highly volatile and nonlinear due to its dependence on\nthe technological advancements and constantly changing domestic and\ninternational regulatory policies and relations. To analyse such vastly\nnonlinear relationships, soft computing techniques has been quite effective as\nthey can predict a compact solution for multi-variable parameters without any\nexplicit insight into the internal system functionalities. This paper reports a\nnovel transfer learning based approach for GDP prediction, which we have termed\nas Domain Adapted Transfer Learning for GDP Prediction. In the proposed\napproach per capita GDP of different nations is predicted using their CO2\nemissions via a model trained on the data of any developed or developing\neconomy.

As it is chemiluminescent radiation in a thin medium, the population\ndistribution over the various roto-vibrational OH energy levels of the\nelectronic ground state is not in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). In\norder to better understand these non-LTE effects, we studied hundreds of OH\nlines in a high-quality mean spectrum based on observations with the\nhigh-resolution Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph at Cerro Paranal in\nChile. Our derived populations cover vibrational levels between v = 3 and 9,\nrotational levels up to N = 24, and individual $\\Lambda$-doublet components\nwhen resolved. As the reliability of these results critically depends on the\nEinstein-A coefficients used, we tested six different sets and found clear\nsystematic errors in all of them, especially for Q-branch lines and individual\n$\\Lambda$-doublet components. In order to minimise the deviations in the\npopulations for the same upper level, we used the most promising coefficients\nfrom Brooke et al. (2016) and further improved them with an empirical\ncorrection approach. The resulting rotational level populations show a clear\nbimodality for each v, which is characterised by a probably fully thermalised\ncold component and a hot population with rotational temperatures between about\n700 (v = 9) and 7,000 K (v = 4). The latter causes non-LTE contributions at low\nN, which can be estimated quite robustly based on the two-temperature model.\nThe bimodality is also clearly indicated by the different dependence of the\npopulations on changes in the effective height of the OH emission layer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 May 2020 19:44:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 May 2020 10:46:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-18"}
