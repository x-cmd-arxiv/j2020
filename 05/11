A\nprominent characteristic of DRAM-NVM hybrid memory is that it has NVM access\nlatency much higher than DRAM access latency. We call this inter-memory\nasymmetry. We observe that parasitic components on a long bitline are a major\nsource of high latency in both DRAM and NVM, and a significant factor\ncontributing to high-voltage operations in NVM, which impact their reliability.\nWe propose an architectural change, where each long bitline in DRAM and NVM is\nsplit into two segments by an isolation transistor. One segment can be accessed\nwith lower latency and operating voltage than the other. By introducing tiers,\nwe enable non-uniform accesses within each memory type (which we call\nintra-memory asymmetry), leading to performance and reliability trade-offs in\nDRAM-NVM hybrid memory. We extend existing NVM-DRAM OS in three ways. First, we\nexploit both inter- and intra-memory asymmetries to allocate and migrate memory\npages between the tiers in DRAM and NVM. Second, we improve the OS's page\nallocation decisions by predicting the access intensity of a newly-referenced\nmemory page in a program and placing it to a matching tier during its initial\nallocation. This minimizes page migrations during program execution, lowering\nthe performance overhead. Third, we propose a solution to migrate pages between\nthe tiers of the same memory without transferring data over the memory channel,\nminimizing channel occupancy and improving performance. Our overall approach,\nwhich we call MNEME, to enable and exploit asymmetries in DRAM-NVM hybrid\ntiered memory improves both performance and reliability for both single-core\nand multi-programmed workloads.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 May 2020 18:53:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-12"}

We observe that overwriting unknown memory\ncontent can incur significantly higher latency and energy compared to\noverwriting known all-zeros or all-ones content. This is because all-zeros or\nall-ones content is overwritten by programming the PCM cells only in one\ndirection, i.e., using either SET or RESET operations, not both. In this paper,\nwe propose data content aware PCM writes (DATACON), a new mechanism that\nreduces the latency and energy of PCM writes by redirecting these requests to\noverwrite memory locations containing all-zeros or all-ones. DATACON operates\nin three steps. First, it estimates how much a PCM write access would benefit\nfrom overwriting known content (e.g., all-zeros, or all-ones) by\ncomprehensively considering the number of set bits in the data to be written,\nand the energy-latency trade-offs for SET and RESET operations in PCM. Second,\nit translates the write address to a physical address within memory that\ncontains the best type of content to overwrite, and records this translation in\na table for future accesses. We exploit data access locality in workloads to\nminimize the address translation overhead. Third, it re-initializes unused\nmemory locations with known all-zeros or all-ones content in a manner that does\nnot interfere with regular read and write accesses. DATACON overwrites unknown\ncontent only when it is absolutely necessary to do so. We evaluate DATACON with\nworkloads from state-of-the-art machine learning applications, SPEC CPU2017,\nand NAS Parallel Benchmarks.

Rev. A 45, 7002 (1992)] with a turbulent motion of the environment taken\ninto account is studied with the field theoretic renormalization group (RG).\nThe turbulent flow is modelled by the synthetic $d$-dimensional anisotropic\nvelocity ensemble introduced by Avellaneda and Majda [Commun. Math. Phys.131:\n381 (1990)] with finite correlation time. The Hwa-Kardar model with\ntime-independent (spatially quenched) random noise is considered alongside the\noriginal model with the white noise. The aim of the present paper is to explore\nfixed points of RG equations which determine the possible types of universality\nclasses (regimes of critical behavior of the system) and critical dimensions of\nthe measurable quantities. Our calculations demonstrate that influence of the\ntype of the random noise is extremely large: in contrast to the case of the\nwhite noise where the system possess three fixed points, the case of the\nspatially quenched noise involves four fixed points with overlapping stability\nregions. This means that in the latter case the critical behavior of the system\ndepends not only on the global parameters of the system which is the usual\ncase, but also on the initial values of the charges (coupling constants) of the\nsystem. These initial conditions determine the specific fixed point which will\nbe reached by RG flow. Since now the critical properties of the system are not\ndefined strictly by its parameters the situation may be interpreted as\nuniversality violation. Such systems are not forbidden but they are very rare.\nIt is especially interesting that the same model without turbulent motion of\nthe environment does not predict this nonuniversal behavior and demonstrates\nthe \"usual\" one with prescribed universality classes instead [J.~Stat.

The radio active galactic nuclei (AGN) studied show recently born radio\njets. In this stage, the plasma jets can have the largest impact on the ISM, as\nalso predicted by state-of-the-art simulations. The two targets have quite\ndifferent ages, allowing us to get snapshots of the effects of radio jets as\nthey grow. Interestingly, both also host powerful quasar emission. The largest\nmass outflow rate of molecular gas is found in a radio galaxy hosting a newly\nborn radio jet emerging from an obscuring cocoon of gas and dust. Although the\nmass outflow rate is high (few hundred Msun/yr), the outflow is limited to the\ninner few hundred pc region. In a second object, the jet is larger (a few kpc)\nand is in a more advanced evolutionary phase. In this object, the distribution\nof the molecular gas is reminiscent of what is seen, on larger scales, in\ncool-core clusters hosting radio galaxies. Gas deviating from quiescent\nkinematics is not very prominent, limited only to the very inner region, and\nhas a low mass outflow rate. Instead, on kpc scales, the radio lobes appear\nassociated with depressions in the distribution of the molecular gas,\nsuggesting they have broken out from the dense nuclear region. The AGN does not\nappear to be able at present to stop the star formation observed in this\ngalaxy. These results suggest that the effects of the radio source start in the\nfirst phases by producing outflows which, however, tend to be limited to the\nkpc region. After that, the effects turn into producing large-scale bubbles\nwhich could, in the long term, prevent the surrounding gas from cooling.

All of this, complying\nwith privacy policies and making the measurement acceptable.

Replenishing earth\nand soils from outside the river has been considered as an effective way to\nmitigate this issue. However, its cost-effective implementation has not been\nconsidered from a theoretical side. This paper presents a tractable new\nstochastic control model to deal with this issue. The sediment dynamics in the\nriver environment follow non-smooth and continuous-time piecewise deterministic\ndynamics. The model assumes that the observation of the sediment dynamics is\ncarried out only randomly and discretely, and that the sediment can be\nreplenished at each observation time with cost. This partial observation\nassumption is consistent with the fact that continuously obtaining the\nenvironmental information is difficult in applications. The performance index\nto penalize the sediment depletion has a non-smooth term as well. We\ndemonstrate that these non-smoothness factors harmonize with a dynamic\nprogramming principle, and derive the optimality equation in a degenerate\nelliptic form governing the most cost-efficient sediment replenishment policy.\nWe analytically derive and verify an exact solution under a simplified\ncondition for a discounted case, an Ergodic case, and a complete information\ncase.

To alleviate this difficulty,\nsubclasses are often considered. The class of weighted marked graphs with\nrelaxed place constraint (WMG=< for short), in which each place has at most one\ninput and one output, and the larger class of choice-free (CF) nets, in which\neach place has at most one output, have been extensively studied to this end,\nwith various applications.\n  In this work, we develop new properties related to the fundamental and\nintractable problems of reachability, liveness and reversibility in weighted\nPetri nets. We focus mainly on the homogeneous Petri nets with a single shared\nplace (H1S nets for short), which extend the expressiveness of CF nets by\nallowing one shared place (i.e. a place with at least two outputs and possibly\nseveral inputs) under the homogeneity constraint (i.e. all the output weights\nof the shared place are equal). Indeed, this simple generalization already\nyields new challenging problems and is expressive enough for modeling existing\nuse-cases, justifying a dedicated study.\n  One of our central results is the first characterization of liveness in a\nsubclass of H1S nets more expressive than WMG=< that is expressed by the\ninfeasibility of an integer linear program (ILP) of polynomial size. This trims\ndown the complexity to co-NP, contrasting with the known EXPSPACE-hardness of\nliveness in the more general case of weighted Petri nets. In the same subclass,\nwe obtain a new reachability property related to the live markings, which is a\nvariant of the well-known Keller's theorem. Another central result is a new\nreversibility characterization for the live H1S class, simplifying its\nchecking. Finally, we apply our results to use-cases, highlight their\nscalability and discuss their extensibility to more expressive classes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 May 2020 00:29:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-12"}

Providing a proof of\nquantumness is the first step towards constructing a useful quantum computer.\nThere are currently three approaches for exhibiting proofs of quantumness: (i)\nInverting a classically-hard one-way function (e.g. using Shor's algorithm).\nThis seems technologically out of reach. (ii) Sampling from a\nclassically-hard-to-sample distribution (e.g. BosonSampling). This may be\nwithin reach of near-term experiments, but for all such tasks known\nverification requires exponential time. (iii) Interactive protocols based on\ncryptographic assumptions. The use of a trapdoor scheme allows for efficient\nverification, and implementation seems to require much less resources than (i),\nyet still more than (ii).\n  In this work we propose a significant simplification to approach (iii) by\nemploying the random oracle heuristic. (We note that we do not apply the\nFiat-Shamir paradigm.) We give a two-message (challenge-response) proof of\nquantumness based on any trapdoor claw-free function.

This problem is known to have an\nagnostic Gaussian Process (GP) bandit interpretation in which an appropriately\nconstructed GP surrogate model with kernel $K$ is used to obtain an upper\nconfidence bound (UCB) algorithm. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm\n(\\texttt{LP-GP-UCB}) where the usual GP surrogate model is augmented with Local\nPolynomial (LP) estimators of the H\\\"older smooth function $f$ to construct a\nmulti-scale UCB guiding the search for the optimizer. We analyze this algorithm\nand derive high probability bounds on its simple and cumulative regret. We then\nprove that the elements of many common RKHS are H\\\"older smooth and obtain the\ncorresponding H\\\"older smoothness parameters, and hence, specialize our regret\nbounds for several commonly used kernels. When specialized to the Squared\nExponential (SE) kernel, \\texttt{LP-GP-UCB} matches the optimal performance,\nwhile for the case of Mat\\'ern kernels $(K_{\\nu})_{\\nu>0}$, it results in\nuniformly tighter regret bounds for all values of the smoothness parameter\n$\\nu>0$. Most notably, for certain ranges of $\\nu$, the algorithm achieves\nnear-optimal bounds on simple and cumulative regrets, matching the\nalgorithm-independent lower bounds up to polylog factors, and thus closing the\nlarge gap between the existing upper and lower bounds for these values of\n$\\nu$. Additionally, our analysis provides the first explicit regret bounds, in\nterms of the budget $n$, for the Rational-Quadratic (RQ) and Gamma-Exponential\n(GE). Finally, experiments with synthetic functions as well as a CNN\nhyperparameter tuning task demonstrate the practical benefits of our\nmulti-scale partitioning approach over some existing algorithms numerically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 May 2020 01:55:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-12"}

The tracks patterned\nwith differences in the magnetic-anisotropy energy are well-paved without a\npotential pocket, whereas the tracks carved out of magnetic films have the\npotential pockets at corners due to the demagnetizing field.

Using a segment of the optical fiber near a major\ngrocery store on Sand Hill Road we find a 50% decrease in vehicle count\nimmediately following the order, but data from near Stanford Hospital showed a\nfar more subtle change due to on-going hospital activities. We compare the\ninformation derived from DAS measurements to other quarantine response metrics\nand find a strong correlation with the relative changes reported by Google and\nApple using mobile phone data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 May 2020 04:45:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-02"}

The effective\ngreen valley fraction for field galaxies is lower than that for group or\ncluster galaxies, which reveals a strong positive mass dependence and mild\nredshift evolution.

When the\nitems being retrieved are documents, the time and memory cost of employing\nTransformers over a full sequence of document terms can be prohibitive. A\npopular strategy involves considering only the first n terms of the document.\nThis can, however, result in a biased system that under retrieves longer\ndocuments. In this work, we propose a local self-attention which considers a\nmoving window over the document terms and for each term attends only to other\nterms in the same window. This local attention incurs a fraction of the compute\nand memory cost of attention over the whole document. The windowed approach\nalso leads to more compact packing of padded documents in minibatches resulting\nin additional savings.

This paper tackles the challenge of using\nbelief-based rewards for a deep RL agent, by offering a simple insight that\nmaximizing any convex function of the belief of the agent can be approximated\nby instead maximizing a prediction reward: a reward based on prediction\naccuracy.

Although the minimum can be computed exactly, by\nexpensive symbolic algebra techniques, gradient descent only approximates the\ndesired minimum to any desired level of accuracy. We show that computing the\ngradient of $f$ amounts to computing the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of\na certain matrix associated with the input set, making it simple to implement.\nWe believe it to be superior to other approximate techniques (mainly the\nellipsoid algorithm) used previously to find this transformation, and it should\nrun much faster in practice.\n  We prove that $f$ is smooth, which yields convergence rate proportional to\n$1/\\epsilon$, where $\\epsilon$ is the desired approximation accuracy.

We\nincorporate disk migration in simulations of the evolving interior of hot\nJupiters to determine whether migration has a long lasting effect on the\ninflation of planets. We quantify the difference between the radius of a\nmigrated planet and the radius of a planet that formed in situ as the radius\ndiscrepancy. We remain agnostic about the physical mechanism behind interior\nheating, but assume it scales with the received stellar flux by a certain\nfraction.

It is also at the basis of the large majority of\napproximations to the functionals of density functional theory. As such, its\nexchange-correlation energy has been extensively studied, and is well-known for\nsystems of 1, 2, and 3 dimensions. Here, we extend this model and compute the\nexchange and correlation energy, as a function of the Wigner-Seitz radius\n$r_s$, for arbitrary dimension $D$. We find a very different behavior for\nreduced dimensional spaces ($D=1$ and 2), our three dimensional space, and for\nhigher dimensions.

The instability transports\nangular momentum much more efficiently (by several orders of magnitude) than it\ndoes at the equator, and we estimate that the GSF instability could contribute\nto the missing angular momentum transport required in both red giant and\nsubgiant stars.

Face image forgery\ndetection has made considerable progresses in exposing specific FIM, but it is\nstill in scarcity of a robust fake face detector to expose face image forgeries\nunder complex scenarios such as with further compression, blurring, scaling,\netc. Due to the relatively fixed structure, convolutional neural network (CNN)\ntends to learn image content representations.

In principle quantum repeaters allow one to\novercome losses. However, realistic hardware parameters make long-distance\nquantum communication a challenge in practice. For instance, in many protocols\nan entangled pair is generated that needs to wait in quantum memory until the\ngeneration of an additional pair. During this waiting time the first pair\ndecoheres, impacting the quality of the final entanglement produced.

The existence of similar spaces for the intersection cohomology groups of\na stratified space is a long-standing open problem asked by M. Goresky and R.\nMacPherson. One feature of this work is a construction of such simplicial sets.\nFrom works of R. MacPherson, J.

This is encoded in the category of simplicial sets over the\nnerve of the poset of strata.

We demonstrated the efficacy of our Taylor-net in\npredicting a broad spectrum of Hamiltonian dynamic systems, including the\npendulum, the Lotka--Volterra, the Kepler, and the H\\'enon--Heiles systems. Our\nmodel exhibits unique computational merits by outperforming previous methods to\na great extent regarding the prediction accuracy, the convergence rate, and the\nrobustness despite using extremely small training data with a short training\nperiod (6000 times shorter than the predicting period), small sample sizes, and\nno intermediate data to train the networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 May 2020 10:32:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 May 2020 05:10:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 8 Apr 2021 18:49:23 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 20 Feb 2022 01:20:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-22"}

In this paper, we\nstudy the relation of both models when Hubbard interactions are added, using\nthe density-matrix renormalization-group algorithm. To this end, we express the\nfermionic Hofstadter model in a hybrid-space representation, and define a\nfamily of interactions, which connects 1d Hubbard charge pumps to 2d Hubbard\nChern insulators. We study a three-band model at particle density $\\rho=2/3$,\nwhere the topological quantization of the 1d charge pump changes from Chern\nnumber $C=2$ to $C=-1$ as the interaction strength increases. We find that the\n$C=-1$ phase is robust when varying the interaction terms on narrow-width\ncylinders. However, this phase does not extend to the limit of the 2d\nHofstadter-Hubbard model, which remains in the $C=2$ phase.

In dense urban environments with people returning to\nwork and public transportation resuming full capacity, enforcing strict social\ndistancing measures will be extremely challenging, if not practically\nimpossible. Governments are thus paying close attention to particular locations\nthat may become the next cluster of disease spreading. Indeed, certain places,\nlike some people, can be \"super-spreaders.\" Is a bustling train station in a\ncentral business district more or less susceptible and vulnerable as compared\nto teeming bus interchanges in the suburbs? Here, we propose a quantitative and\nsystematic framework to identify spatial super-spreaders and the novel concept\nof super-susceptibles, i.e. respectively, places most likely to contribute to\ndisease spread or to people contracting it. Our proposed data-analytic\nframework is based on the daily-aggregated ridership data of public transport\nin Singapore. By constructing the directed and weighted human movement networks\nand integrating human flow intensity with two neighborhood diversity metrics,\nwe are able to pinpoint super-spreader and super-susceptible locations. Our\nresults reveal that most super-spreaders are also super-susceptibles and that\ncounterintuitively, busy peripheral bus interchanges are riskier places than\ncrowded central train stations. Our analysis is based on data from Singapore,\nbut can be readily adapted and extended for any other major urban center. It\ntherefore serves as a useful framework for devising targeted and cost-effective\npreventive measures for urban planning and epidemiological preparedness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 May 2020 12:55:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-28"}

The language used to describe abnormalities in mammographic reports\nis based on the breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS). Assigning a\ncorrect BI-RADS category to each examined mammogram is a strenuous and\nchallenging task for even experts. This paper proposes a new and effective\ncomputer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system to classify mammographic masses into four\nassessment categories in BI-RADS. The mass regions are first enhanced by means\nof histogram equalization and then semiautomatically segmented based on the\nregion growing technique. A total of 130 handcrafted BI-RADS features are then\nextrcated from the shape, margin, and density of each mass, together with the\nmass size and the patient's age, as mentioned in BI-RADS mammography. Then, a\nmodified feature selection method based on the genetic algorithm (GA) is\nproposed to select the most clinically significant BI-RADS features. Finally, a\nback-propagation neural network (BPN) is employed for classification, and its\naccuracy is used as the fitness in GA. A set of 500 mammogram images from the\ndigital database of screening mammography (DDSM) is used for evaluation.

With the\nannouncement of the Apple/Google partnership to introduce contact-tracing\nfunctionality to iOS and Android, it seems likely that this will be adopted in\nmany countries. An important part of the functionality of the app will be to\ndecide whether a person should be advised to self-isolate, be tested or end\nisolation. However, the privacy preserving nature of the Apple/Google contact\ntracing algorithm means that centralised curation of these decisions is not\npossible so each phone must use its own \"risk model\" to inform decisions.\nIdeally, the risk model should use Bayesian inference to decide the best course\nof action given the test results of the user and those of other users.

Specifically, we\nimprove the original MelGAN by the following aspects. First, we increase the\nreceptive field of the generator, which is proven to be beneficial to speech\ngeneration. Second, we substitute the feature matching loss with the\nmulti-resolution STFT loss to better measure the difference between fake and\nreal speech. Together with pre-training, this improvement leads to both better\nquality and better training stability. More importantly, we extend MelGAN with\nmulti-band processing: the generator takes mel-spectrograms as input and\nproduces sub-band signals which are subsequently summed back to full-band\nsignals as discriminator input. The proposed multi-band MelGAN has achieved\nhigh MOS of 4.34 and 4.22 in waveform generation and TTS, respectively. With\nonly 1.91M parameters, our model effectively reduces the total computational\ncomplexity of the original MelGAN from 5.85 to 0.95 GFLOPS.

Specifically, we focus on classification problems\nand propose the notion of \"Certain Predictions\" (CP) -- a test data example can\nbe certainly predicted (CP'ed) if all possible classifiers trained on top of\nall possible worlds induced by the incompleteness of data would yield the same\nprediction.\n  We study two fundamental CP queries: (Q1) checking query that determines\nwhether a data example can be CP'ed; and (Q2) counting query that computes the\nnumber of classifiers that support a particular prediction (i.e., label). Given\nthat general solutions to CP queries are, not surprisingly, hard without\nassumption over the type of classifier, we further present a case study in the\ncontext of nearest neighbor (NN) classifiers, where efficient solutions to CP\nqueries can be developed -- we show that it is possible to answer both queries\nin linear or polynomial time over exponentially many possible worlds.\n  We demonstrate one example use case of CP in the important application of\n\"data cleaning for machine learning (DC for ML).\" We show that our proposed\nCPClean approach built based on CP can often significantly outperform existing\ntechniques in terms of classification accuracy with mild manual cleaning\neffort.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 May 2020 13:58:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 May 2020 10:46:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-13"}

In\ngeneral, rule-based and linear models lack accuracy, while deep learning\ninterpretability is based on rough approximations of the underlying inference.\nUsing a linear combination of conjunctive clauses in propositional logic,\nTsetlin Machines (TMs) have shown competitive performance on diverse\nbenchmarks. However, to do so, many clauses are needed, which impacts\ninterpretability. Here, we address the accuracy-interpretability challenge in\nmachine learning by equipping the TM clauses with integer weights. The\nresulting Integer Weighted TM (IWTM) deals with the problem of learning which\nclauses are inaccurate and thus must team up to obtain high accuracy as a team\n(low weight clauses), and which clauses are sufficiently accurate to operate\nmore independently (high weight clauses). Since each TM clause is formed\nadaptively by a team of Tsetlin Automata, identifying effective weights becomes\na challenging online learning problem. We address this problem by extending\neach team of Tsetlin Automata with a stochastic searching on the line (SSL)\nautomaton. In our novel scheme, the SSL automaton learns the weight of its\nclause in interaction with the corresponding Tsetlin Automata team, which, in\nturn, adapts the composition of the clause by the adjusting weight. We evaluate\nIWTM empirically using five datasets, including a study of interpetability. On\naverage, IWTM uses 6.5 times fewer literals than the vanilla TM and 120 times\nfewer literals than a TM with real-valued weights. Furthermore, in terms of\naverage F1-Score, IWTM outperforms simple Multi-Layered Artificial Neural\nNetworks, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbor, Random\nForest, XGBoost, Explainable Boosting Machines, and standard and real-value\nweighted TMs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 May 2020 14:18:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-12"}

Here\nwe introduce a generalization of this approach for use with multiple impurity\natoms, and demonstrate its validity by comparing the $\\Delta_\\mathbf{k}^\\alpha$\nit generates to the $\\Delta_\\mathbf{k}^\\alpha$ determined from single-atom\nscattering in FeSe where $s_{\\pm}$ energy-gap symmetry is established. Finally,\nto exemplify utility, we use the multi-atom technique on LiFeAs and find\nscattering interference between the hole-like and electron-like pockets as\npredicted for $\\Delta_\\mathbf{k}^\\alpha$ of opposite sign.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 May 2020 14:30:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 May 2020 14:49:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 3 Jul 2020 16:06:31 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 25 Nov 2020 02:36:14 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2021 23:28:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-14"}

In this paper we show that capillary phenomena\ncan be unmistakably described using the mechanical approach, as long as the\nsystem on which the forces act is properly defined. After reminding the\nmicroscopic origin of a tangential tensile force at the interface, we derive\nthe Young-Dupr{\\'e} equation, emphasizing that this relation should be\ninterpreted as an interface condition at the contact line, rather than a force\nbalance equation. This correct interpretation avoids misidentification of\ncapillary forces acting on a given system. Moreover, we show that a reliable\nmethod to correctly identify the acting forces is to define a control volume\nthat does not embed any contact line on its surface. Finally, as an\nillustration of this method, we apply the mechanical approach in a variety of\nways on a classic example: the derivation of the equilibrium height of\ncapillary rise (Jurin's law).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 May 2020 14:32:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-17"}

However, SfM itself relies on local features\nwhich are prone to fail when images were taken under different conditions,\ne.g., day/ night changes. At the same time, manually annotating feature\ncorrespondences is not scalable and potentially inaccurate. In this work, we\npropose a semi-automated approach to generate reference poses based on feature\nmatching between renderings of a 3D model and real images via learned features.\nGiven an initial pose estimate, our approach iteratively refines the pose based\non feature matches against a rendering of the model from the current pose\nestimate. We significantly improve the nighttime reference poses of the popular\nAachen Day-Night dataset, showing that state-of-the-art visual localization\nmethods perform better (up to $47\\%$) than predicted by the original reference\nposes. We extend the dataset with new nighttime test images, provide\nuncertainty estimates for our new reference poses, and introduce a new\nevaluation criterion. We will make our reference poses and our framework\npublicly available upon publication.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 May 2020 15:13:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 May 2020 15:31:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 8 Nov 2020 04:07:27 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 30 Dec 2020 14:29:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-01"}

In the\nabsence of angular symmetry of both electric and magnetic properties of the\nresonator infill, only azimuthally uniform distribution of both TM and TE\nfields is expected to occur in the resonator. The comparison is made of the\nresults obtained through the proposed method and of the test problem solution\nobtained with use of commercial solvers. The method appears to be efficient for\ncomputational complex algorithms for solving spectral problems, including those\nfor studying the chaotic properties of electrodynamic systems' spectra.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 May 2020 15:42:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-12"}

In the meantime, an adversary transmits an adversarial\nperturbation (subject to a power budget) to fool receivers into making errors\nin classifying signals that are received as superpositions of transmitted\nsignals and adversarial perturbations. First, these evasion attacks are shown\nto fail when channels are not considered in designing adversarial\nperturbations. Then, realistic attacks are presented by considering channel\neffects from the adversary to each receiver. After showing that a channel-aware\nattack is selective (i.e., it affects only the receiver whose channel is\nconsidered in the perturbation design), a broadcast adversarial attack is\npresented by crafting a common adversarial perturbation to simultaneously fool\nclassifiers at different receivers. The major vulnerability of modulation\nclassifiers to over-the-air adversarial attacks is shown by accounting for\ndifferent levels of information available about the channel, the transmitter\ninput, and the classifier model.

Pruning schemes have been proposed for RNNs to eliminate the\nredundant (close-to-zero) weight values. On one hand, the non-structured\npruning methods achieve a high pruning rate but introducing computation\nirregularity (random sparsity), which is unfriendly to parallel hardware. On\nthe other hand, hardware-oriented structured pruning suffers from low pruning\nrate due to restricted constraints on allowable pruning structure. This paper\npresents CSB-RNN, an optimized full-stack RNN framework with a novel compressed\nstructured block (CSB) pruning technique.

Second, we provide multiple options for\npre-processing, e.g., filtering, or spectrum image generation by Fourier or\nwavelet transformation. Third, plenty of topologies in terms of NN, 1D/2D/3D\nCNN, and RNN/LSTM/GRU can be customised and a series of pretrained 2D CNN\nmodels, e.g., AlexNet, VGGNet, ResNet can be used easily.

Today, in the\nage of cheap information --cheap to produce, to manipulate, to disseminate--,\nthis cognitive bottleneck translates into hypercompetition for visibility among\nactors (individuals, institutions, etc). The same social communication\nincentive --visibility-- pushes actors to mutualistically interact with\nspecific memes, seeking the virality of their messages. In turn, contents are\ndriven by selective pressure, i.e. the chances to persist and reach widely are\ntightly subject to changes in the communication environment. In spite of all\nthis complexity, here we show that the underlying architecture of the\nusers-memes interaction in information ecosystems, apparently chaotic and\nnoisy, actually evolves towards emergent patterns, reminiscent of those found\nin natural ecosystems. In particular we show, through the analysis of\nempirical, large data streams, that communication networks are structurally\nelastic, i.e. fluctuating from modular to nested architecture as a response to\nenvironmental perturbations (e.g. extraordinary events). We then propose an\necology-inspired modelling framework, bringing to light the precise mechanisms\ncausing the observed dynamical reorganisation. Finally, from numerical\nsimulations, the model predicts --and the data confirm-- that the users'\nstruggle for visibility induces a re-equilibration of the network towards a\nvery constrained organisation: the emergence of self-similar nested\narrangements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 11 May 2020 08:00:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 May 2020 10:11:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-18"}

The interaction between\nthe blood flow and an existing stenosis in the arterial wall is modeled as a\nthree dimensional fluid-structure interaction problem. The blood is assumed to\nbe a non-Newtonian incompressible fluid with a time-dependent viscosity that\nobeys a modified Carreau's model and the flow dynamics is described by the\nNavier-Stokes equations. Whereas, the arterial wall is considered a\nhyperelastic material whose displacement satisfies the quasi-static equilibrium\nequations. Numerical simulations are performed using FreeFem++ on a two\ndimensional domain. We investigate the behavior of the viscosity of blood, its\nspeed and the maximum shear stress. From the numerical results, blood\nrecirculation zones have been identified. Moreover, a zone of the blood of high\nviscosity and low speed has been observed directly after the stenosis in the\nflow direction. This zone may correspond to a blood accumulation and then\nsolidification zone that is subjected to shear stress by the blood flow and to\nforces exerted by the artery wall deformation. Therefore, this zone is thought\nto break and then to release a blood clot that leads to the occlusion of small\narterioles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 10 May 2020 20:07:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-15"}

The fluid dynamics of face masks are investigated via analytical\nand numerical computations.
