The main accent in these developments so far was made on\nstationary or repeated games. In the previous paper of the author the truly\ndynamic quantum game theory was initiated with strategies chosen by players in\nreal time. Since direct continuous observations are known to destroy quantum\nevolutions (so-called quantum Zeno paradox) the necessary new ingredient for\nquantum dynamic games represented the theory of non-direct observations and the\ncorresponding quantum filtering. Another remarkable 21st century branch of game\ntheory represent the so-called mean-field games (MFG), with impressive and ever\ngrowing development.\n  In this paper we are merging these two exciting new branches of game theory.\nBuilding a quantum analog of MFGs requires the full reconstruction of its\nfoundations and methodology, because in $N$-particle quantum evolution\nparticles are not separated in individual dynamics and the key concept of the\nclassical MFG theory, the empirical measure defined as the sum of Dirac masses\nof the positions of the players, is not applicable in quantum setting.\n  As a preliminary result we derive the new nonlinear stochastic Schr\\\"odinger\nequation, as the limit of continuously observed and controlled system of large\nnumber of interacting quantum particles, the result that may have an\nindependent value. We then show that to a control quantum system of interacting\nparticles there corresponds a special system of classical interacting particles\nwith the identical limiting MFG system, defined on an appropriate Riemanian\nmanifold. Solutions of this system are shown to specify approximate Nash\nequilibria for $N$-agent quantum games.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 May 2020 17:35:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-06"}

Nowadays, solid-state single-electron sources are key elements of\nthe emerging new technologies of quantum information processing and\nsingle-electron electronics. Moreover, advanced research in free-electron\nquantum optics and developments in electron microscopy require the point\nsources of free electrons in vacuum, which can be controlled on a single\nelectron level. However, up to now, single-electron vacuum guns were not\nrealized in practice. The problems to be solved include the formation of stable\ntip-shaped heterostructured emitters and control of liberated electrons in time\nand energy domain.

However, although\ncontact tracing has been performed widely, the mathematical understanding of\ncontact tracing has not been fully established and it has not been clearly\nunderstood what determines the efficacy of contact tracing. Here, we reveal\nthat, compared with \"forward\" tracing---tracing to whom disease spreads,\n\"backward\" tracing---tracing from whom disease spreads---is profoundly more\neffective. The effectiveness of backward tracing is due to simple but\noverlooked biases arising from the heterogeneity in contacts. Using simulations\non both synthetic and high-resolution empirical contact datasets, we show that\neven at a small probability of detecting infected individuals, strategically\nexecuted contact tracing can prevent a significant fraction of further\ntransmissions.

It is therefore of utmost interest to determine if there are\nnovel observational signatures of this scenario. Work has shown that for\nmoderately large axion-photon couplings, such clumps can undergo parametric\nresonance into photons, for clumps above a critical mass $M^{\\star}_c$\ndetermined precisely by some of us in Ref. [1]. In order to obtain a clump\nabove the critical mass in the galaxy today would require mergers. In this work\nwe perform full 3-dimensional simulations of pairs of axion clumps and\ndetermine the conditions under which mergers take place through the emission of\nscalar waves, including analyzing head-on and non-head-on collisions, phase\ndependence, and relative velocities. Consistent with other work in the\nliterature, we find that the final mass from the merger\n$M^{\\star}_{\\text{final}}\\approx 0.7(M^{\\star}_1+M^{\\star}_2)$ is larger than\neach of the original clump masses (for $M^{\\star}_1\\sim M^{\\star}_2$). Hence,\nit is possible for sub-critical mass clumps to merge and become super-critical\nand therefore undergo parametric resonance into photons. We find that mergers\nare expected to be kinematically allowed in the galaxy today for high\nPeccei-Quinn scales, which is strongly suggested by unification ideas, although\nthe collision rate is small. While mergers can happen for axions with lower\nPeccei-Quinn scales due to statistical fluctuations in relative velocities, as\nthey have a high collision rate. We estimate the collision and merger rates\nwithin the Milky Way galaxy today. We find that a merger leads to a flux of\nenergy on earth that can be appreciable and we mention observational search\nstrategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 May 2020 18:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 31 May 2020 23:42:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2020 22:25:33 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 31 Jul 2020 17:28:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-03"}

Few controllable aspects\naside, this discrepancy is largely believed to be arising from the presence of\na varying degree of twist angle inhomogeneity across different samples. Real\nspace maps indeed reveal TBG devices splitting into several large domains of\ndifferent twist angles. Motivated by these observations, we study the quantum\nmechanical tunneling across a domain wall (DW) that separates two such regions.\nWe show that the tunneling of the moir\\'e particles can be understood by the\nformation of an effective step potential at the DW. The height of this step\npotential is simply a measure of the difference in twist angles. These\ncomputations lead us to identify the global transport signatures for detecting\nand quantifying the local twist angle variations. In particular, Using\nLandauer-B\\\"uttiker formalism we compute single-channel conductance ($dI/dV$)\nand Fano factor for shot noise (ratio of noise power and mean current). A\nzero-bias, sub-meV transport gap is observed in the conductance which scales\nwith the height of the step potential. One of the key findings of our work is\nthat transport in presence of twist angle inhomogeneity is \"noisy\", though\nsub-Poissonian. In particular, the differential Fano factor peaks near the van\nHove energies corresponding to the domains in the sample. The location and the\nstrength of the peak is simply a measure of the degree of twist angle\ninhomogeneity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 May 2020 18:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-30"}

We\nevaluate the SAMs by Henriques et al. (2015; H15) and by Lagos et al. (2012;\nL12), implemented in the Millennium Run, by comparing their predictions for G3L\nto observations at smaller scales than previous studies and also for pairs of\nlens galaxies from different populations. We compare the G3L signal predicted\nby the SAMs to measurements in the overlap of the Galaxy And Mass Assembly\nsurvey (GAMA), the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS), and the VISTA Kilo-degree\nInfrared Galaxy survey (VIKING), splitting lens galaxies into two colour and\nfive stellar-mass samples. Using an improved G3L estimator, we measure the\nthree-point correlation of the matter distribution for mixed lens pairs with\ngalaxies from different samples, and unmixed lens pairs with galaxies from the\nsame sample. Predictions by the H15 SAM agree with the observations for all\ncolour-selected and all but one stellar-mass-selected sample with 95%\nconfidence. Deviations occur for lenses with stellar masses below\n$9.5h^{-2}\\mathrm{M}_\\odot$ at scales below $0.2h^{-1}\\mathrm{Mpc}$.\nPredictions by the L12 SAM for stellar-mass selected samples and red galaxies\nare significantly higher than observed, while the predicted signal for blue\ngalaxy pairs is too low. The L12 SAM predicts more pairs of small stellar-mass\nand red galaxies than the H15 SAM and the observations, as well as fewer pairs\nof blue galaxies. Likely explanations are different treatments of environmental\neffects by the SAMs and different models of the initial mass function. We\nconclude that G3L provides a stringent test for models of galaxy formation and\nevolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 May 2020 18:00:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2020 15:31:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-19"}

Nanotechnology has provided increased computing functionality\nper unit volume, energy, and cost. In order for computing systems to continue\nto deliver substantial benefits for the foreseeable future to society at large,\nit is critical that the very notion of computing be examined in the light of\nnanoscale realities. In particular, one needs to ask what it means to compute\nwhen the very building block - the logic switch - no longer exhibits the level\nof determinism required by the von Neumann architecture.

A nation-wide VISE provides clear strategic advantages in\nensuring the US's global superiority in semiconductors. First, a VISE provides\nthe highest quality seed-corn for nurturing transformative ideas that are\ncritically needed today in order for nanotechnology-inspired computing to\nflourish.

By considering transmit\nantenna selection and maximal ratio combining reception at the legitimate and\neavesdropper's receiver sides, we study two relevant scenarios $(i)$ the\ntransmitter does not know the eavesdropper's channel state information (CSI),\nand $(ii)$ the transmitter has knowledge of the CSI of the eavesdropper link.\nFor this purpose, we first obtain novel and tractable expressions for the\nstatistics of the maximum of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.)\nvariates related to the legitimate path.

The question arises of how universality is maintained in\ncorrection-to-scaling in systems of the same universality class but with very\ndifferent corner geometries. 2D geometries deliver the simplest such examples\nthat can be constructed with and without corners.

Moreover, for some\nsurvival studies involving time to occurrence of some asymptomatic events,\nsurvival times are typically interval censored between consecutive clinical\ninspections. In this article, we propose a robust semiparametric model for\nclustered interval-censored survival data under a paradigm of Bayesian ensemble\nlearning, called Soft Bayesian Additive Regression Trees or SBART (Linero and\nYang, 2018), which combines multiple sparse (soft) decision trees to attain\nexcellent predictive accuracy.

In addition to being applicable for\nleft-censored, right-censored, and interval-censored survival data, our\nmethodology is implemented using a data augmentation scheme which allows for\nexisting Bayesian backfitting algorithms to be used.

In this paper, we introduce Quest, a system that empowers\norganizations to observe individuals and spaces to implement policies for\nsocial distancing and contact tracing using WiFi connectivity data in a passive\nand privacy-preserving manner. The goal is to ensure the safety of employees\nand occupants at an organization, while protecting the privacy of all parties.\nQuest incorporates computationally- and information-theoretically-secure\nprotocols that prevent adversaries from gaining knowledge of an individual's\nlocation history (based on WiFi data); it includes support for accurately\nidentifying users who were in the vicinity of a confirmed patient, and then\ninforming them via opt-in mechanisms.

Under a latent position model, we show\nthe omnibus embedding implicitly regularizes its latent position estimates\nwhich induces a finite-sample bias-variance tradeoff for latent position\nestimation. We establish an explicit bias expression, derive a uniform\nconcentration bound on the residual, and prove a central limit theorem\ncharacterizing the distributional properties of these estimates. These explicit\nbias and variance expressions enable us to state sufficient conditions for\nexact recovery in community detection tasks and develop a pivotal test\nstatistic to determine whether two graphs share the same set of latent\npositions; demonstrating that accurate inference is achievable despite the\nestimator's inconsistency. These results are demonstrated in several\nexperimental settings where statistical procedures utilizing the omnibus\nembedding are competitive, and oftentimes preferable, to comparable embedding\ntechniques.

We identify closely interacting vortical\nelements as vortical network communities through community detection\nalgorithms.

The integration of effective relational learning and reasoning\nmethods is one of the key challenges in this direction, as neural learning and\nsymbolic reasoning offer complementary characteristics that can benefit the\ndevelopment of AI systems. Relational labelling or link prediction on knowledge\ngraphs has become one of the main problems in deep learning-based natural\nlanguage processing research. Moreover, other fields which make use of\nneural-symbolic techniques may also benefit from such research endeavours.\nThere have been several efforts towards the identification of missing facts\nfrom existing ones in knowledge graphs. Two lines of research try and predict\nknowledge relations between two entities by considering all known facts\nconnecting them or several paths of facts connecting them. We propose a\nneural-symbolic graph neural network which applies learning over all the paths\nby feeding the model with the embedding of the minimal subset of the knowledge\ngraph containing such paths. By learning to produce representations for\nentities and facts corresponding to word embeddings, we show how the model can\nbe trained end-to-end to decode these representations and infer relations\nbetween entities in a multitask approach. Our contribution is two-fold: a\nneural-symbolic methodology leverages the resolution of relational inference in\nlarge graphs, and we also demonstrate that such neural-symbolic model is shown\nmore effective than path-based approaches\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 May 2020 22:46:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-07"}

As the programming\nand system stack support becomes mature, it enables acceleration opportunities\nwithin a mobile system, where the system performance envelope is scaled up with\na plethora of programmable co-processors. Thus, intelligent services designed\nfor mobile users can choose between running inference on the CPU or any of the\nco-processors on the mobile system, or exploiting connected systems, such as\nthe cloud or a nearby, locally connected system. By doing so, the services can\nscale out the performance and increase the energy efficiency of edge mobile\nsystems. This gives rise to a new challenge - deciding when inference should\nrun where. Such execution scaling decision becomes more complicated with the\nstochastic nature of mobile-cloud execution, where signal strength variations\nof the wireless networks and resource interference can significantly affect\nreal-time inference performance and system energy efficiency. To enable\naccurate, energy-efficient deep learning inference at the edge, this paper\nproposes AutoScale.

The future\ntrajectories of agents can be inferred using two important cues: the locations\nand past motion of agents, and the static scene structure. Due to the high\nvariability in scene structure and agent configurations, prior work has\nemployed the attention mechanism, applied separately to the scene and agent\nconfiguration to learn the most salient parts of both cues. However, the two\ncues are tightly linked. The agent configuration can inform what part of the\nscene is most relevant to prediction. The static scene in turn can help\ndetermine the relative influence of agents on each other's motion. Moreover,\nthe distribution of future trajectories is multimodal, with modes corresponding\nto the agent's intent. The agent's intent also informs what part of the scene\nand agent configuration is relevant to prediction. We thus propose a novel\napproach applying multi-head attention by considering a joint representation of\nthe static scene and surrounding agents.

We employ a subwavelength structure in which an\narray of tiny holes are etched in a metallic slab with the neighboring distance\n$\\ell$ that is smaller than half of the wavelength. By tuning the incident wave\nat resonant frequencies, the subwavelength structure generates strong\nillumination patterns that are able to probe both low and high spatial\nfrequency components of the imaging sample sitting above the structure. The\nimage of the sample is obtained by performing stable numerical reconstruction\nfrom the far-field measurement of the diffracted wave. It is demonstrated that\na resolution of $\\ell/2$ can be obtained for reconstructed images, thus one can\nachieve super-resolution by arranging multiple holes within one wavelength.\n  The proposed approach may find applications in wave-based imaging such as\nelectromagnetic and ultrasound imaging. It attains two advantages that are\nimportant for practical realization. It avoids the difficulty to control the\ndistance the between the probe and the sample surface with high precision.

The timing of\nsuch programs needs to be data-independent and precise. We describe a parallel\nsynchronous software model, which executes as N parallel threads on a processor\nwith word-length N. Each thread is a single-bit synchronous machine with\nprecise, contention-free timing, while each of the N threads still executes as\nan independent machine. The resulting software supports fine-grained parallel\nexecution. In contrast to earlier work to obtain precise and repeatable timing\nin software, our solution does not require modifications to the processor\narchitecture nor specialized instruction scheduling techniques. In addition,\nall threads run in parallel and without contention, which eliminates the\nproblem of thread scheduling. We use hardware (HDL) semantics to describe a\nthread as a single-bit synchronous machine. Using logic synthesis and code\ngeneration, we derive a parallel synchronous implementation of this design.

The key challenge in these tight formations is that the majority of\nthe pore sizes are less than 50 nm. At this scale, the fluid properties are\naffected by nanoconfinement effects due to the increased fluid-solid\ninteractions. For instance, gas adsorption to the pore walls could account for\nup to 85% of the total hydrocarbon volume in a tight reservoir. Although there\nare analytical solutions that describe this phenomenon for simple geometries,\nthey are not suitable for describing realistic pores, where surface roughness\nand geometric anisotropy play important roles. To describe these, molecular\ndynamics (MD) simulations are used since they consider fluid-solid and\nfluid-fluid interactions at the molecular level.

SDSTs can compare\ndata values using a linear order on the data domain, which can not be done by\nSSRTs.\n  We give a machine independent characterization of SSRTs with origin\nsemantics, along the lines of Myhill-Nerode theorem. Machine independent\ncharacterizations for similar models have formed the basis of learning\nalgorithms and enabled us to understand fragments of the models. Origin\nsemantics of transducers track which positions of the output originate from\nwhich positions of the input. Although a restriction, using origin semantics is\nwell justified and known to simplify many problems related to transducers. We\nuse origin semantics as a technical building block, in addition to\ncharacterizations of deterministic register automata. However, we need to build\nmore on top of these to overcome some challenges unique to SSRTs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 May 2020 05:13:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2020 04:27:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-15"}

In\nthis work, we propose an across-array coding strategy that assigns a codeword\nto multiple independent memory arrays, and exploit a real-time channel\nestimation scheme to estimate the instantaneous status of the ReRAM channel.\nSince the coded bits from different arrays experience independent channels, a\n\"diversity\" gain can be obtained during decoding, and when the codeword is\nadequately distributed over different memory arrays, the code actually performs\nas that over an uncorrelated channel.

Additionally, we construct a new knowledge base to power the\nsocialbot by collecting social chat content from a variety of sources.

It is well known that large-amplitude magnetic fluctuations\nand coherent structures in such an environment obey a fractal scaling, and our\nspecific aim is to study for the first time the effects of the fractality of\nthese environments on stochastic acceleration. We have shown that an injected\nMaxwellian energy distribution is heated and forms a high energy tail in a very\nshort time. Using standard parameters for the low solar corona, the injected\nMaxwellian distribution of electrons gets heated from the initial 100 eV to 10\nKeV, and the power-law index of the high energy tail is about -2.3-4.0. The\nhigh energy tail starts around 100 keV, and reaches 10 MeV. The index of the\npower-law tail depends on the system size, and it is in good agreement with\nobserved values for realistic system sizes. The heating and acceleration\nprocess is very fast (\\sim 2 s). The reason why the acceleration time is so\nshort is that the particles are trapped within small scale parts of the fractal\nenvironment, and their scattering mean free path reduces drastically. The\npresence of small scale activity also pulls easily particles from the thermal\npool, so there is no need for a seed population. The mean square displacement\nin space and energy is superdiffusive for the high energy particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 May 2020 09:16:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-27"}

In this work, a two-step optimization-based motion planner is proposed\nfor autonomous maneuvering of ships in constrained environments such as\nharbors. A lattice-based motion planner is used in a first step to compute a\nfeasible, but suboptimal solution to a discretized version of the motion\nplanning problem. This solution is then used to enable efficient warm-start and\nas a terminal manifold for a second receding-horizon improvement step. Both\nsteps of the algorithm use a high-fidelity model of the ship to plan feasible\nand energy-efficient trajectories. Moreover, a novel algorithm is proposed for\nautomatic computation of spatial safety envelopes around the trajectory\ncomputed by the lattice-based planner.

Hence, the measurement of these corrections has the potential\nof providing important information on the equation of state of nuclear matter.\nExtensive work has been carried out over the last decade to quantify these\ncorrections, but it has so far been restricted to stars with zero intrinsic\nmagnetic fields. While the corrections introduced by the magnetic tension and\nmagnetic pressure are expected to be subdominant, it is nevertheless useful to\ndetermine the precise conditions under which these corrections become\nimportant. To address this question, we have carried out a second-order\nperturbative analysis of the tidal deformability of magnetised compact stars\nunder a variety of magnetic-field strengths and equations of state describing\neither neutron stars or quark stars. Overall, we find that magnetically induced\ncorrections to the tidal deformability will produce changes in the\ngravitational-wave phase evolution that are unlikely to be detected for\nrealistic magnetic field i.e., $B\\sim 10^{10} - 10^{12}\\,{\\rm G}$.

In this paper, a methodology is presented to\ngenerate the segmented surfaces in real time and these can be used in modeling\nthe 3D objects. At first an algorithm is proposed for efficient map building\nfrom single shot data of spinning Lidar. It is based on fast meshing and\nsub-sampling. It exploits the physical design and the working principle of the\nspinning Lidar sensor. The generated mesh surfaces are then segmented by\nestimating the normal and considering their homogeneity. The segmented surfaces\ncan be used as proposals for predicting geometrically accurate model of objects\nin the robots activity environment. The proposed methodology is compared with\nsome popular point cloud segmentation methods to highlight the efficacy in\nterms of accuracy and speed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 May 2020 10:17:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-14"}

A two-section matching\nnetwork is proposed for PAmain, which simultaneously compensates for phase\ndifferences of the main and auxiliary amplification paths.

We develop a\ngeneral theory to determine the viscoelastic stresses in the rotator, under any\nlinear rheology, for both long-axis (LAM) and short-axis (SAM) modes. By the\nmethods of continuum mechanics, we calculate the power dissipated by the stress\nfield and the viscoelastic material strain which enables us to determine the\ntimescale of the precession dampening. To illustrate how the theory is used, we\napply our framework to a triaxial 1I/2017 (`Oumuamua) and 4179 Toutatis under\nthe Maxwell regime.

In these urban areas residents with different racial\nor socioeconomic background tend to form homogeneous clusters. Schelling's\nfamous agent-based model for residential segregation explains how such clusters\ncan form even if all agents are tolerant, i.e., if they agree to live in mixed\nneighborhoods. For segregation to occur, all it needs is a slight bias towards\nagents preferring similar neighbors. Very recently, Schelling's model has been\ninvestigated from a game-theoretic point of view with selfish agents that\nstrategically select their residential location. In these games, agents can\nimprove on their current location by performing a location swap with another\nagent who is willing to swap. We significantly deepen these investigations by\nstudying the influence of the underlying topology modeling the residential area\non the existence of equilibria, the Price of Anarchy and on the dynamic\nproperties of the resulting strategic multi-agent system.

As is found\nfrom the computation of the superconformal index, these dressed operators at\nfirst sight appear to be dressed by massive elementary fields which don't seem\nto contribute to the low-energy physics. We argue that these dressed fields can\nbe interpreted as a non-abelian monopole dressed (or not dressed) by massless\nmatter fields. Based on this analysis, we will report on the s-confinement\nphases with non-trivial monopole operators, which is consistent with the\nduality proposals \\cite{Aharony:2014uya, Aharony:2013dha}. Along these studies,\nwe find that the duality reported in \\cite{Aharony:2014uya} must be modified\nwhen $k=\\pm \\frac{1}{2}(F-\\bar{F})$ in order to have a correct duality map of\nthe baryonic operators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 May 2020 12:23:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 May 2020 03:56:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-12"}

The\ndust attenuation affecting the stellar populations of these galaxies (obtained\nusing full spectrum stellar population fitting methods) is compared with the\ndust attenuation in the gas (derived from the Balmer decrement). Both of these\nattenuation measures increase for local regions of galaxies with higher star\nformation rates; the dust attenuation affecting the stellar populations\nincreases more so than the dust attenuation in the gas, causing the ratio of\nthe dust attenuation affecting the stellar populations to the dust attenuation\nin the gas to decrease for local regions of galaxies with higher star formation\nrate densities.

Here we compile and confront a database of C,\nFe, S and H exchanges between the fluid Earth (atmosphere, ocean, biosphere)\nand lithosphere (crust and upper mantle) with the record of deoxygenation to\nquantify organic carbon sources and sinks in the Cenozoic. We show that the\nsubduction of oxidized oceanic lithosphere and degassing of reduced gas from\nthe Earth's interior is a sink of oxygen, and that this sink significantly\nexceeds the rate of atmospheric deoxygenation in the Pleistocene. A relative\nconstancy of atmospheric O2 in the Cenozoic requires that the organic carbon\ncycle was a net source of O2 and sink of CO2, photosynthesis outpaced\nrespiration by an average of ca 40 MtC yr-1 over the last 50 million years. The\ncost for the relatively invariant atmospheric oxygen concentration is the\ncoexistence of two photosynthetically-driven imbalances in the cycles of iron\nand carbon that offset each other to near perfection. The weak escape of OC\nfrom continents and oceans to the lithosphere is more intriguing. It\ndemonstrates that the organic carbon cycle remains under surprisingly strong\nkinetic control, despite evolution/optimization of respiratory metabolisms and\nrising atmospheric O2 for more than 2.4 billion years.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 May 2020 13:31:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-07"}

We use our star-graphic lattices to express some\nwell-known results of graph theory and compute the number of elements of a\nparticular star-graphic lattice. For more researching ice-flower systems and\nstar-graphic lattices we propose Decomposition Number String Problem, finding\nstrongly colored uniform ice-flower systems and connecting our star-graphic\nlattices with traditional lattices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 May 2020 13:45:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-07"}

However, the synergy between human and technology can be strengthened\nif the technology is able to distinguish and react to human emotions. Models\nthat rely on unconscious indications of human emotions, such as\n(neuro)physiological signals, hold promise in personalization of feedback and\nadaptation of the interaction. The current study elaborated on adopting a\npredictive approach in studying human emotional processing based on brain\nactivity. More specifically, we investigated the proposition of predicting\nself-reported human empathy based on EEG cortical asymmetry in different areas\nof the brain. Different types of predictive models i.e. multiple linear\nregression analyses as well as binary and multiclass classifications were\nevaluated. Results showed that lateralization of brain oscillations at specific\nfrequency bands is an important predictor of self-reported empathy scores.\nAdditionally, prominent classification performance was found during\nresting-state which suggests that emotional stimulation is not required for\naccurate prediction of empathy -- as a personality trait -- based on EEG data.\nOur findings not only contribute to the general understanding of the mechanisms\nof empathy, but also facilitate a better grasp on the advantages of applying a\npredictive approach compared to hypothesis-driven studies in neuropsychological\nresearch. More importantly, our results could be employed in the development of\nbrain-computer interfaces that assist people with difficulties in expressing or\nrecognizing emotions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 May 2020 13:49:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-07"}

The inclusion\nof Halpha measurements, the role of stochasticity for low mass clusters, the\nassumptions about reddening, and the choices of SSP model and metallicity all\nhave important impacts on the age-dating of clusters.

The fraction of\nlight found in clusters relative to the total light (i.e., T_L) in the U, B,\nand V filters in 25 different ~kpc-size regions throughout NGC 4449 correlates\nwith both the specific Region Luminosity, R_L, and the dominant age of the\nunderlying stellar population in each region.

The traditional concept of contact\nangle, a purely geometrical measure related to curvature, is often used for\ncharacterizing the wetting state of a system. It can be determined from Young's\nequation by applying equilibrium thermodynamics. However, whether contact angle\nis a representative measure of wetting for systems with significant complexity\nis unclear. Herein, we hypothesize that topological principles based on the\nGauss-Bonnet theorem could yield a robust measure to characterize wetting.\n  Theory and Experiments We introduce a macroscopic contact angle based on the\ndeficit curvature of the fluid interfaces that are imposed by contacts with\nother immiscible phases. We perform sessile droplet simulations followed by\nmultiphase experiments for porous sintered glass and Bentheimer sandstone to\nassess the sensitivity and robustness of the topological approach and compare\nthe results to other traditional approaches.\n  Findings We show that the presented topological principle is consistent with\nthermodynamics under the simplest conditions through a variational analysis.\nFurthermore, we elucidate that at sufficiently high image resolution the\nproposed topological approach and local contact angle measurements are\ncomparable. While at lower resolutions, the proposed approach provides more\naccurate results being robust to resolution-based effects.

We apply this\ntechnique to a study where unmeasured confounding and selection bias are both\nconcerns, and to another study in which possible differential exposure\nmisclassification and unmeasured confounding are concerns. We also show that a\n\"multi-bias E-value\" can describe the minimal strength of joint bias-parameter\nassociation necessary for an observed risk ratio to be compatible with a null\ncausal effect (or with other pre-specified effect sizes). This may provide\nintuition about the relative impacts of each type of bias. The approach we\ndescribe is easy to implement with minimal assumptions, and we provide R\nfunctions to do so.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 May 2020 15:30:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-11"}

By loading the table of hashes and $n$-grams into a\nquantum computer we can speed up the process of mapping $n$-grams to their\nhashes.

In applications where some confounding\nfactors are known, estimating simultaneously the contribution of known and\nlatent variance components in random effect models is a challenge that has so\nfar relied on numerical gradient-based optimizers to maximize the likelihood\nfunction. This is unsatisfactory because the resulting solution is poorly\ncharacterized and the efficiency of the method may be suboptimal. Here we prove\nanalytically that maximum-likelihood latent variables can always be chosen\northogonal to the known confounding factors, in other words, that\nmaximum-likelihood latent variables explain sample covariances not already\nexplained by known factors. Based on this result we propose a restricted\nmaximum-likelihood method which estimates the latent variables by maximizing\nthe likelihood on the restricted subspace orthogonal to the known confounding\nfactors, and show that this reduces to probabilistic PCA on that subspace. The\nmethod then estimates the variance-covariance parameters by maximizing the\nremaining terms in the likelihood function given the latent variables, using a\nnewly derived analytic solution for this problem. Compared to gradient-based\noptimizers, our method attains greater or equal likelihood values, can be\ncomputed using standard matrix operations, results in latent factors that don't\noverlap with any known factors, and has a runtime reduced by several orders of\nmagnitude. Hence the restricted maximum-likelihood method facilitates the\napplication of random effect modelling strategies for learning latent variance\ncomponents to much larger gene expression datasets than possible with current\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 May 2020 15:53:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Sep 2021 06:29:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 4 Nov 2021 20:41:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-08"}

Following this, an anonymous graph convolutional network,\nnamed AN-GCN, is proposed to counter against edge-perturbing attacks.\nSpecifically, we present a node localization theorem to demonstrate how the GCN\nlocates nodes during its training phase. In addition, we design a staggered\nGaussian noise based node position generator, and devise a spectral graph\nconvolution based discriminator in detecting the generated node positions.\nFurther, we give the optimization of the above generator and discriminator.\nAN-GCN can classify nodes without taking their position as input. It is\ndemonstrated that the AN-GCN is secure against edge-perturbing attacks in node\nclassification tasks, as AN-GCN classifies nodes without the edge information\nand thus makes it impossible for attackers to perturb edges anymore. Extensive\nevaluations demonstrated the effectiveness of the general edge-perturbing\nattack model in manipulating the classification results of the target nodes.\nMore importantly, the proposed AN-GCN can achieve 82.7% in node classification\naccuracy without the edge-reading permission, which outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art GCN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 May 2020 08:15:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Oct 2020 11:14:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 23 Apr 2021 13:44:19 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 7 May 2021 08:57:07 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 1 Jun 2021 03:17:58 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Thu, 17 Jun 2021 01:41:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-18"}

The estimation of nonsingular linear loading spaces\nis carried out in two steps. First, we use an eigenanalysis of a nonnegative\ndefinite matrix of the data to separate the unit-root processes from the\nstationary ones and a modified method to specify the number of unit roots.

The classical\nMalliavin-Rubel theorem gives necessary and sufficient conditions of the\nexistence of an entire function of exponential type (we write e.f.e.t.)\n$f\\not\\equiv 0$, vanishing on the given positive sequence ${\\sf Z}=\\{{\\sf\nz}_k\\}_{k\\in \\mathbb N}\\subset \\mathbb R^+$ and satisfying the constraint\n$|f|\\leq |g|$ on $i\\mathbb R$, where $g$ is an e.f.e.t., vanishing on positive\nsequence ${\\sf W}=\\{{\\sf w}_k\\}_{k\\in \\mathbb N}\\subset \\mathbb R^+$. A\ncombination of these special balayage processes of genus $q=0$ and $q=1$ allows\nus to extend the Malliavin-Rubel theorem to arbitrary complex sequences ${\\sf\nZ}=\\{{\\sf z}_k\\}_{k\\in \\mathbb N}\\subset \\mathbb C$ separated by a pair of\nvertical angles from the imaginary axis $i\\mathbb R$, with much more general\nrestrictions $\\ln |f|\\leq M$ on the imaginary axis $i\\mathbb R$, where $M$ is\nan subharmonic function of finite type under the order $1$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 May 2020 13:12:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-13"}

Unlike other ITS, a teacher can develop new learning modules\nfor Korbit in a matter of hours. To facilitate learning across a widerange of\nSTEM subjects, Korbit uses a mixed-interface, which includes videos,\ninteractive dialogue-based exercises, question-answering, conceptual diagrams,\nmathematical exercises and gamification elements. Korbit has been built to\nscale to millions of students, by utilizing a state-of-the-art cloud-based\nmicro-service architecture. Korbit launched its first course in 2019 on machine\nlearning, and since then over 7,000 students have enrolled.

The conventional approaches for the lane\nmarker detection problem perform a pixel-level dense prediction task followed\nby sophisticated post-processing that is inevitable since lane markers are\ntypically represented by a collection of line segments without thickness. In\nthis paper, we propose a method performing direct lane marker vertex prediction\nin an end-to-end manner, i.e., without any post-processing step that is\nrequired in the pixel-level dense prediction task. Specifically, we translate\nthe lane marker detection problem into a row-wise classification task, which\ntakes advantage of the innate shape of lane markers but, surprisingly, has not\nbeen explored well. In order to compactly extract sufficient information about\nlane markers which spread from the left to the right in an image, we devise a\nnovel layer, which is utilized to successively compress horizontal components\nso enables an end-to-end lane marker detection system where the final lane\nmarker positions are simply obtained via argmax operations in testing time.\nExperimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method,\nwhich is on par or outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on two popular lane\nmarker detection benchmarks, i.e., TuSimple and CULane.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 May 2020 12:48:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-19"}

The effect of pressure and temperature on the\nseparation performances of graphtriyne layers was investigated. Compared with\nthe single layer graphtriyne, bilayer graphtriyne can adsorb more molecules\nwith relatively good selectivity, due to the action of the interlayer region as\nan adsorption site. The interlayer adsorption selectivity of CO2/N2 and CO2/H2O\nat a temperature of 333 K and a pressure of 4 atm have been found to be equal\nto about 20.23 and 1.85, respectively. We also observed that the bilayer\ngraphtriyne membrane has high CO2 and H2O permeances compared to N2 with\npermeance selectivity ranging from 4.8 to 6.5.
