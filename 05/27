In addition, to enable analysis of WM\ntracts in large datasets and in clinical practice it is essential to have\nmethodology that is fast and easy to apply. This work therefore presents a new\napproach for WM tract segmentation: Neuro4Neuro, that is capable of direct\nextraction of WM tracts from diffusion tensor images using convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN). This 3D end-to-end method is trained to segment 25 WM tracts in\naging individuals from a large population-based study (N=9752, 1.5T MRI). The\nproposed method showed good segmentation performance and high reproducibility,\ni.e., a high spatial agreement (Cohen's kappa, k = 0.72 ~ 0.83) and a low\nscan-rescan error in tract-specific diffusion measures (e.g., fractional\nanisotropy: error = 1% ~ 5%). The reproducibility of the proposed method was\nhigher than that of a tractography-based segmentation algorithm, while being\norders of magnitude faster (0.5s to segment one tract). In addition, we showed\nthat the method successfully generalizes to diffusion scans from an external\ndementia dataset (N=58, 3T MRI).

In\nconcordance with the literature, results showed a widespread reduction of\nmicrostructural organization with aging and substantial group-wise\nmicrostructure differences between dementia subtypes. In conclusion, we\npresented a highly reproducible and fast method for WM tract segmentation that\nhas the potential of being used in large-scale studies and clinical practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 May 2020 16:14:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-27"}

The potential field source surface model is frequently used as a\nbasis for further scientific investigations where a comprehensive coronal\nmagnetic field is of importance.

Vorticity can be\nbiased in the presence of shear flows, but its dynamical equation is well\nknown; the swirling strength is a more precise criterion for the identification\nof vortical flows, but its evolution equation is not known yet. Therefore, we\nexplore the possibility of deriving a dynamical equation for the swirling\nstrength. We then apply the two equations to analyze radiative MHD simulations\nof the solar atmosphere produced with the CO5BOLD code. We present a detailed\nreview of the swirling strength criterion and the mathematical derivation of\nits evolution equation. This equation did not exist in the literature before\nand it constitutes a novel tool that is suitable for the analysis of a wide\nrange of problems in (magneto-)hydrodynamics.

Higher up in the chromosphere, the\nmagnetic terms alone dominate. Moreover, we find that the swirling strength is\nproduced at small scales in a chaotic fashion, especially inside magnetic flux\nconcentrations. The swirling strength represents an appropriate criterion for\nthe identification of vortices in turbulent flows, such as those in the solar\natmosphere. Moreover, its evolution equation, which is derived in this paper,\nis pivotal for obtaining precise information about the dynamics of these\nvortices and the physical mechanisms responsible for their production and\nevolution.

Specifically, we discuss the computation and\ninterpretation of the weighted interval score, which is a proper score that\napproximates the continuous ranked probability score. It can be interpreted as\na generalization of the absolute error to probabilistic forecasts and allows\nfor a decomposition into a measure of sharpness and penalties for over- and\nunderprediction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 May 2020 17:19:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Aug 2020 14:37:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 8 Jan 2021 20:25:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-09"}

Our results\nsuggest that this resonance is responsible for the current 4.3$^{\\circ}$\ninclination of Miranda (instead of previously proposed 3:1 Miranda-Umbriel\nMMR), and that all five moons had their inclinations excited during this\nresonance. Miranda experienced significant tidal heating during the\nAriel-Umbriel 5:3 MMR due to its eccentricity being excited by Ariel's secular\nperturbations. This tidal heating draws energy from shrinking of Miranda's\norbit, rather than Ariel's outward evolution, and can generate heat flows in\nexcess of 100 mW m$^{-2}$, sufficient to produce young coronae on Miranda. We\nfind that this MMR was followed by a sequence of secular resonances, which\nreshuffled the moons' eccentricities and inclinations. We also find that the\nprecession of Oberon's spin axis is close to a resonance with the precession of\nUmbriel's orbital plane, and that this spin-orbit resonance was likely excited\nduring the Ariel-Umbriel 5:3 MMR.

Deviations from\nvertical pressure balance increase with increasing galactocentric radius and\nwith decreasing averaging scale. The different phases are in rough total\npressure equilibrium with one another, but with large deviations from thermal\npressure equilibrium owing to kinetic support in the cold and warm phases,\nwhich dominate the total pressure near the midplane. Bulk flows (e.g., inflows\nand fountains) are important at a few disk scale heights, while thermal\npressure from hot gas dominates at larger heights.

We show that the present day morphological and dynamical\nproperties of accreted globular cluster (GC) streams - those produced from\ntidal stripping of GCs that initially evolved within satellite galaxies and\nlater merged with the Milky Way (MW) - are sensitive to the central DM density\nprofile and mass of their parent satellites.

A first comparison of MW streams\n\"GD-1\" and \"Jhelum\" (likely of accreted GC origin) with our simulations\nindicates a preference for cored subhalos. If these results hold up in future\ndata, the implication is that either the DM cusps were erased by baryonic\nfeedback, or their subhalos naturally possessed cored density profiles implying\nDM models beyond CDM. Moreover, accreted GC streams are highly structured and\nexhibit complex morphological features (e.g., parallel structures and \"spurs\").\nThis implies that the accretion scenario can naturally explain the recently\nobserved peculiarities in some of the MW streams.

The correct decomposition is\none in which pointer states of the system are relatively robust against\nenvironmental monitoring (their entanglement with the environment does not\ncontinually and dramatically increase) and remain localized around\napproximately-classical trajectories. We present an in-principle algorithm for\nfinding such a decomposition by minimizing a combination of entanglement growth\nand internal spreading of the system. Both of these properties are related to\nlocality in different ways. This formalism could be relevant to the emergence\nof spacetime from quantum entanglement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 May 2020 18:01:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 19 Sep 2020 05:45:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2021 01:27:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-24"}

This model has been extensively studied in the last\nthree decades, with conflicting results. Here, by using Gutzwiller-projected\nwave functions and recently developed methods to assess the low-energy\nspectrum, we show the existence of a level crossing between the lowest-energy\ntriplet and singlet excitations for $J_2/J_1 \\approx 0.54$. This fact supports\nthe existence of a phase transition between a gapless spin liquid (which is\nstable for $0.48 \\lesssim J_2/J_1 \\lesssim 0.54$) and a valence-bond solid (for\n$0.54 \\lesssim J_2/J_1 \\lesssim 0.6$), even though no clear sign of dimer order\nis visible in the correlations functions. These results, which confirm recent\ndensity-matrix renormalization calculations on cylindrical clusters [L. Wang\nand A.W. Sandvik, Phys. Rev.

The model solves two similar\nequations between which the only difference is inclusion of NCTs. The equations\nare derived using the following approximations: anelastic, equatorial\nbeta-plane, linearized, zonally symmetric, steady, and a constant dissipation\ncoefficient. The large-scale flows simulated with and without NCTs are compared\nin terms of the meridional-vertical circulation, the zonal wind, and the\npotential temperature. Both results appear like the Hadley circulation. With\nthe model parameters controlled, the results without NCTs minus with NCTs are\nlinear biases due to omitting NCTs. The most prominent bias is a westerly wind\nbias in the ITCZ heating region that emerges because omitting NCTs prevents the\nassociated westward acceleration when heating-induced vertical motion is\npresent. The zonal wind bias divided by the zonal wind with NCTs is 0.120 $\\pm$\n0.007 in terms of the westerly maximum and 0.0452 $\\pm$ 0.0005 in terms of the\nroot mean square (RMS) when the prescribed ITCZ mimics the observed ITCZ in May\nover the East Pacific. These normalized measures of the zonal wind bias\nincrease with a narrower ITCZ or an ITCZ closer to the equator because of a\nweaker subtropical jet stream given the same vertical heating profile. This\ndifference can be traced by a nondimensional parameter scaling the ratio of the\nNCT to the traditional Coriolis term. The scaling encourages restoring NCTs\ninto global models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 May 2020 18:10:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-28"}

Given that new candidates of such systems are emerging, with\nthe Van der Waals crystals and magnetic multilayer systems, it is interesting\nto investigate how the chiral magnetic textures depend on the number of layers\nand the coupling between them. In this article, we model the magnetic layers\nwith a classical Heisenberg spin model, where the sign of the DMI alternates\nfor each consecutive layer. We use Monte Carlo simulations to examine chiral\nmagnetic textures and show that the pitch of magnetic spirals is influenced by\nthe interlayer coupling and the number of layers.

We give an explanation for our findings by proposing a net\nDMI in systems with strongly coupled layers.

The present-day stellar\nage-velocity relationship (AVR) of h277 is nearly identical to that of the\nanalogous solar-neighborhood measurement in the Milky Way.

Such a process is very intriguing in the\nsense of tailoring to explore the double parton structure of nucleons and to\ndetermine the geometry of partons in nuclei. In order to interpret the existing\n$pp$ data with the LHCb detector at the center-of-mass energy $\\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV,\nwe introduce two overlooked mechanisms for the double parton scattering (DPS)\nand single parton scattering (SPS) processes. Besides the conventional DPS\nmode, where the two mesons are produced almost independently in the two\nseparate scattering subprocesses, we propose a novel DPS mechanism that the two\nconstituent (heavy) quarks stemming from two hard scatterings can form into a\ncomposite particle, like the $J/\\psi$ meson, during the hadronization phase.\nHowever, it turns out the corresponding contribution is small in\n$J/\\psi+c\\bar{c}$ hadroproduction.

In many such studies, treatment\nchanges may be initiated by either the patient or by their clinician and can\nthus vary widely across patients in their timing, number, and type. Indeed, in\nthe observational longitudinal pathway of the STEP-BD study of bipolar\ndepression, one of the motivations for this work, no two patients have the same\ntreatment history even after coarsening clinic visits to a weekly time-scale.\nEstimation of an optimal treatment regime using such data is challenging as one\ncannot naively pool together patients with the same treatment history, as is\nrequired by methods based on inverse probability weighting, nor is it possible\nto apply backwards induction over the decision points, as is done in Q-learning\nand its variants. Thus, additional structure is needed to effectively pool\ninformation across patients and within a patient over time. Current scientific\ntheory for many chronic mental illnesses maintains that a patient's disease\nstatus can be conceptualized as transitioning among a small number of discrete\nstates. We use this theory to inform the construction of a partially observable\nMarkov decision process model of patient health trajectories wherein observed\nhealth outcomes are dictated by a patient's latent health state. Using this\nmodel, we derive and evaluate estimators of an optimal treatment regime under\ntwo common paradigms for quantifying long-term patient health. The finite\nsample performance of the proposed estimator is demonstrated through a series\nof simulation experiments and application to the observational pathway of the\nSTEP-BD study.

This, in turn, led to an increase in the stability against convection,\na reduction in overall cloud coverage on the dayside (reducing scattering),\nleading to warmer surface temperatures. The increased direct heating of the\ntroposphere also led to more efficient heat transport from the dayside to the\nnightside and, therefore, a reduced day-night temperature contrast.

To begin, We verify and analyze the mode\ntransitions and the motion trajectories of a fully submerged sphere vibrating\nfreely in all directions for the Reynolds number up to $30\\,000$. Next, the\nresponse dynamics of a transversely vibrating sphere is studied for three\nvalues of normalized immersion ratio ($h^*=h/D$, where $h$ is the distance from\nthe top of the sphere to undisturbed free-surface level and $D$ is the sphere\ndiameter), at $h^*=1$ (fully submerged sphere with no free-surface effect),\n$h^*=0$ (where the top of the sphere touches the free surface) and $h^*=-0.25$\n(where the sphere pierces the free surface). At the lock-in range, we observe\nthat the amplitude response at $h^*=0$ is decreased significantly compared to\nthe case at $h^*=1$. It is found that the vorticity flux is diffused due to the\nfree-surface boundary and the free surface acts as a sink of energy that leads\nto a reduction in the transverse force and amplitude response. When the sphere\npierces the free surface at $h^*=-0.25$, the amplitude response at the lock-in\nstate is found to be greater than all the submerged cases studied with the\nmaximum peak-to-peak amplitude of $\\sim2D$. We find that the interaction of the\npiercing sphere with the air-water interface causes a relatively large surface\ndeformation and has a significant impact on the synchronization of the vortex\nshedding and the vibration frequency. Increased streamwise vorticity gives rise\nto a relatively larger transverse force to the piercing sphere at $h^*=-0.25$,\nresulting in greater positive energy transfer per cycle to sustain the\nlarge-amplitude vibration.

In\nthis work, we develop a multi-task learning method to relax this constraint. We\nregard the segmentation problem as a sequence of approximation subproblems that\nare recursively defined and in increasing levels of approximation accuracy. The\nsubproblems are handled by a framework that consists of 1) a segmentation task\nthat learns from pixel-level ground truth segmentation masks of a small\nfraction of the images, 2) a recursive approximation task that conducts partial\nobject regions learning and data-driven mask evolution starting from partial\nmasks of each object instance, and 3) other problem oriented auxiliary tasks\nthat are trained with sparse annotations and promote the learning of dedicated\nfeatures. Most training images are only labeled by (rough) partial masks, which\ndo not contain exact object boundaries, rather than by their full segmentation\nmasks. During the training phase, the approximation task learns the statistics\nof these partial masks, and the partial regions are recursively increased\ntowards object boundaries aided by the learned information from the\nsegmentation task in a fully data-driven fashion. The network is trained on an\nextremely small amount of precisely segmented images and a large set of coarse\nlabels. Annotations can thus be obtained in a cheap way.

Scientifically and technologically important quantum Hamiltonians\ninclude those with spin-$s$, vibrational, photonic, and other bosonic degrees\nof freedom, i.e. problems composed of or approximated by $d$-level particles\n(qudits). Recently, several methods for encoding these systems into a set of\nqubits have been introduced, where each encoding's efficiency was studied in\nterms of qubit and gate counts. Here, we build on previous results by including\neffects of hardware connectivity.

Inspired by how biological motifs such as cells are sometimes\nextracted from their natural environment and studied in an artificial Petri\ndish setting, this paper proposes the Synthetic Petri Dish model for evaluating\narchitectural motifs.

TPT provides a method to\ncalculate statistical properties of the paths into the event. As an initial\ndemonstration of the utility of TPT, we analyze a low-order model of sudden\nstratospheric warming (SSW), a dramatic disturbance to the polar vortex which\ncan induce extreme cold spells at the surface in the midlatitudes. SSW events\npose a major challenge for seasonal weather prediction because of their rapid,\ncomplex onset and development. Climate models struggle to capture the long-term\nstatistics of SSW, owing to their diversity and intermittent nature. We use a\nstochastically forced Holton-Mass-type model with two stable states,\ncorresponding to radiative equilibrium and a vacillating SSW-like regime. In\nthis stochastic bistable setting, from certain probabilistic forecasts TPT\nfacilitates estimation of dominant transition pathways and return times of\ntransitions. These \"dynamical statistics\" are obtained by solving partial\ndifferential equations in the model's phase space. With future application to\nmore complex models, TPT and its constituent quantities promise to improve the\npredictability of extreme weather events, through both generation and\nprincipled evaluation of forecasts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 May 2020 01:36:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}

Aiming to satisfy the high\nrequirements of wireless aerial networks, several multiple access techniques\nhave been investigated. In particular, space-division multiple access(SDMA) and\npower-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) present promising\nmultiplexing gains for aerial downlink and uplink. Nevertheless, these gains\nare limited as they depend on the conditions of the environment.

We\nthereby demonstrate how a quantum photocell in the cold bath can operate as a\ncontinuum quantum heat engine with the sequence of photon pulses continuously\napplied. We specifically introduce the power efficiency of the quantum\nphotocell in terms of the ratio of output power delivered to an external load\nwith current and voltage to the input power delivered by the photon pulse. Our\nstudy indicates a possibility that a quantum system driven by external fields\ncan act as an efficient quantum heat engine under non-equilibrium\nthermodynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 May 2020 06:12:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}

However,\nmost of these intelligent services-such as computer vision-continually learn\nwith time. When the internals within the abstracted 'black box' become hidden\nand evolve, pitfalls emerge in the robustness of applications that depend on\nthese evolving services. Without adapting the way developers plan and construct\nprojects reliant on intelligent services, significant gaps and risks result in\nboth project planning and development. Therefore, how can software engineers\nbest mitigate software evolution risk moving forward, thereby ensuring that\ntheir own applications maintain quality? Our proposal is an architectural\ntactic designed to improve intelligent service-dependent software robustness.\nThe tactic involves creating an application-specific benchmark dataset\nbaselined against an intelligent service, enabling evolutionary behaviour\nchanges to be mitigated. A technical evaluation of our implementation of this\narchitecture demonstrates how the tactic can identify 1,054 cases of\nsubstantial confidence evolution and 2,461 cases of substantial changes to\nresponse label sets using a dataset consisting of 331 images that evolve when\nsent to a service.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 May 2020 06:15:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-28"}

However,\nthe current SDN-based security enforcement mechanisms require network managers\nto fully understand the underlying configurations of network. Facing the\nincreasingly complex and huge SDN networks, we urgently need a novel security\npolicy management mechanism which can be completely transparent to any\nunderlying information. That is it can permit network managers to define\nupper-level security policies without containing any underlying information of\nnetwork, and by means of model transformation system, these upper-level\nsecurity policies can be transformed into their corresponding lower-level\npolicies containing underlying information automatically. Moreover, it should\nensure system model updated by the generated lower-level policies can hold all\nof security properties defined in upper-level policies.

We turn to the\nclassification of ETCs for new considerations that may help to design better\nstrategies for ETCs searches. We take a basic taxonomic approach to ETCs and\ninvestigate the implications of the new classification on ETCs observational\npatterns. We use as a counter-example to our qualitative classification the\nquantitative scheme of Kardashev. We propose a classification based on the\nabilities of ETCs to modify their environment and to integrate with it: Class 0\nuses the environment as it is, Class 1 modifies the it to fit its needs, Class\n2 modifies itself to fit the environment and Class 3 ETC is fully integrated\nwith the environment. Combined with the classical Kardashev's scale our scheme\nforms a 2d scheme for interpreting ETC properties. The new framework makes it\nobvious that the available energy is not an unique measure of ETCs, it may not\neven correlate with how well that energy is used. The possibility for progress\nwithout increased energy consumption implies lower detectability, so the\nexistence of a Kardashev Type III ETC in the Milky Way cannot be ruled out.\nThis reasoning weakens the Fermi paradox, allowing the existence of advanced,\nyet not energy hungry, low detectability ETCs. The integration of ETCs with\nenvironment makes it impossible to tell apart technosignatures from natural\nphenomena. Thus, the most likely opportunity for SETI searches is to look for\nbeacons, specifically set up by them for young civilizations like us (if they\nwant to do that is a matter of speculation). The other SETI window is to search\nfor ETCs at technological level close to ours. To rephrase the saying of A.\nClarke, sufficiently advanced civilizations are indistinguishable from nature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 May 2020 08:04:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 May 2020 06:42:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-22"}

Our approach constructs a safe-region, termed 'generalized shape',\nat each planning iteration, which represents the obstacle-free region based on\nlocally-sensed environment information. A collision-free path is computed by\nsampling points in the generalized shape and is used to generate a smooth,\ntime-parametrized trajectory by minimizing snap. The generated trajectories are\nconstrained to lie within the generalized shape, which ensures the agent\nmaneuvers in the locally obstacle-free space. As the agent reaches boundary of\n'sensing shape' in a planning iteration, a re-plan is triggered by receding\nhorizon planning mechanism that also enables initialization of the next\nplanning iteration.

The method is inspired by the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear\nDynamics (SINDy) approach of {\\it [Brunton et al., PNAS, 113 (15) (2016)\n3932-3937]}, which relies on two main assumptions: the state variables are\nknown {\\it a priori} and the governing equations lend themselves to sparse,\nlinear expansions in a (nonlinear) basis of the state variables.

However, it has been observed that insects may transiently form\npairs with synchronized relative motion while moving through the swarm. The\norigin of this phenomenon remains an open question. In particular, it is not\nknown if pairing is a new behavioral process or whether it is a natural\nbyproduct of typical swarming behavior. Here, using an \"adaptive-gravity\" model\nthat proposes that insects interact via long-range gravity-like acoustic\nattractions that are modulated by the total background sound (via \"adaptivity\"\nor fold-change detection) and that reproduces measured features of real swarms,\nwe show that pair formation can indeed occur without the introduction of\nadditional behavioral rules. In the model, pairs form robustly whenever two\ninsects happen to move together from the center of the swarm (where the\nbackground sound is high) toward the swarm periphery (where the background\nsound is low). Due to adaptivity, the attraction between the pair increases as\nthe background sound decreases, thereby forming a bound state since their\nrelative kinetic energy is smaller than their pair-potential energy. When the\npair moves into regions of high background sound, however, the process is\nreversed and the pair may break up. Our results suggest that pairing should\nappear generally in biological systems with long-range attraction and adaptive\nsensing, such as during chemotaxis-driven cellular swarming.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 May 2020 08:44:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-28"}

Here we show domain wall skyrmions also emerge in systems with broken\ninversion symmetry after exposure to an ultrafast laser pulse, carrying an\ninteger topological charge. Whilst domain wall skyrmions do not appear in the\nrelaxed state due to quick thermal decay following an Arrhenius law, they play\na key role in controlling the final skyrmion population through annihilations\nwith skyrmions of opposite topological charge, with the resultant skyrmion\nstates following a Poisson distribution. Using single-shot linearly polarised\nlaser pulses, as well as a train of circularly polarised laser pulses, we show\nthat when a high degree of disorder is created, the possibility of nucleating a\nsingle N\\'eel skyrmion is accompanied by the possibility of nucleating a\nskyrmion with domain wall skyrmion pair, which results in a self-annihilation\ncollapse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 May 2020 08:44:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-09"}

This problem\nsetting offers the promise of utilizing such datasets to acquire policies\nwithout any costly or dangerous active exploration. However, it is also\nchallenging, due to the distributional shift between the offline training data\nand those states visited by the learned policy. Despite significant recent\nprogress, the most successful prior methods are model-free and constrain the\npolicy to the support of data, precluding generalization to unseen states. In\nthis paper, we first observe that an existing model-based RL algorithm already\nproduces significant gains in the offline setting compared to model-free\napproaches. However, standard model-based RL methods, designed for the online\nsetting, do not provide an explicit mechanism to avoid the offline setting's\ndistributional shift issue. Instead, we propose to modify the existing\nmodel-based RL methods by applying them with rewards artificially penalized by\nthe uncertainty of the dynamics. We theoretically show that the algorithm\nmaximizes a lower bound of the policy's return under the true MDP. We also\ncharacterize the trade-off between the gain and risk of leaving the support of\nthe batch data. Our algorithm, Model-based Offline Policy Optimization (MOPO),\noutperforms standard model-based RL algorithms and prior state-of-the-art\nmodel-free offline RL algorithms on existing offline RL benchmarks and two\nchallenging continuous control tasks that require generalizing from data\ncollected for a different task.

When public policies depend on a\nmisrepresentation of trends in the areas they are aimed at, they become random\nand disruptive, which can be interpreted as a source of disorder. Here we\nconsider policies on the spatial organization of the French Higher Education\nand Research system, which reflects the authorities' hypothesis that scientific\nexcellence is the prerogative of a few large urban agglomerations. By\ngeographically identifying all the French publications listed in the Web of\nScience databases between 1999 and 2017, we highlight a spatial deconcentration\ntrend, which has slowed down in recent years due to a freezed growth of the\nteaching force. This deconcentration continues, however, to sustain the growth\nof scientific production in small and medium-sized towns. An examination of the\nlarge conurbations shows the relative decline of sites that nevertheless have\nbeen highlighted as examples to be followed by the Excellence policies\n(Strasbourg among others). The number of students and faculty has grown less\nthere, and it is a plaussible explanation for the relative decline in\nscientific production. We show that the publication output of a given site\ndepends directly and strongly on the number of researchers hosted there. Based\non precise data at the French level, our results confirm what is already known\nat world scale. In conclusion, we question the amount of disorder resulting\nfrom policies aligned with poorly assessed trends.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 May 2020 08:48:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 3 Feb 2021 09:38:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 4 Feb 2021 08:12:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-05"}

To pursue high model fidelity, it is usually\ndesirable to retrain the model on both historical and new data, since it can\naccount for both long-term and short-term user preference. However, a full\nmodel retraining could be very time-consuming and memory-costly, especially\nwhen the scale of historical data is large. In this work, we study the model\nretraining mechanism for recommender systems, a topic of high practical values\nbut has been relatively little explored in the research community.\n  Our first belief is that retraining the model on historical data is\nunnecessary, since the model has been trained on it before. Nevertheless,\nnormal training on new data only may easily cause overfitting and forgetting\nissues, since the new data is of a smaller scale and contains fewer information\non long-term user preference. To address this dilemma, we propose a new\ntraining method, aiming to abandon the historical data during retraining\nthrough learning to transfer the past training experience. Specifically, we\ndesign a neural network-based transfer component, which transforms the old\nmodel to a new model that is tailored for future recommendations. To learn the\ntransfer component well, we optimize the \"future performance\" -- i.e., the\nrecommendation accuracy evaluated in the next time period. Our Sequential\nMeta-Learning(SML) method offers a general training paradigm that is applicable\nto any differentiable model. We demonstrate SML on matrix factorization and\nconduct experiments on two real-world datasets. Empirical results show that SML\nnot only achieves significant speed-up, but also outperforms the full model\nretraining in recommendation accuracy, validating the effectiveness of our\nproposals.

Specifically, a major challenge is encountered\nwhen constructing a test on a block structure obtained by applying a specific\nclustering algorithm to a finite size matrix. In this case, it becomes crucial\nto consider the selective bias in the block structure, that is, the block\nstructure is selected from all the possible cluster memberships based on some\ncriterion by the clustering algorithm. To cope with this problem, this study\nprovides a selective inference method for latent block models. Specifically, we\nconstruct a statistical test on a set of row and column cluster memberships of\na latent block model, which is given by a squared residue minimization\nalgorithm. The proposed test, by its nature, includes and thus can also be used\nas the test on the set of row and column cluster numbers. We also propose an\napproximated version of the test based on simulated annealing to avoid\ncombinatorial explosion in searching the optimal block structure. The results\nshow that the proposed exact and approximated tests work effectively, compared\nto the naive test that did not take the selective bias into account.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 May 2020 10:44:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Mar 2021 06:05:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 26 Apr 2021 05:51:07 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 8 May 2021 05:19:36 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 6 Jun 2021 04:38:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-08"}

While journalism is meant to process yet\nunknown events by design, the dynamically evolving situation affected all\naspects of life in such profound ways that even the routines of crisis\nreporting seemed to be insufficient. Critics noted tendencies to horse-race\nreporting and uncritical coverage, with journalism being too close to official\nstatements and too affirmative of political decisions. However, empirical data\non the performance of journalistic news media during the crisis has been\nlacking thus far. The current study analyzes the Facebook messages of\njournalistic news media during the early Coronavirus crisis, based on a large\nGerman data set from January to March 2020. Using computational content\nanalysis methods, reach and interactions, topical structure, relevant actors,\nnegativity of messages, as well as the coverage of fabricated news and\nconspiracy theories were examined. The topical structure of the near-time\nFacebook coverage changed during various stages of the crisis, with just\npartial support for the claims of critics. The initial stages were somewhat\nlacking in topical breadth, but later stages offered a broad range of coverage\non Corona-related issues and societal concerns. Further, journalistic media\ncovered fake news and conspiracy theories during the crisis, but they\nconsistently contextualized them as what they were and debunked the false\nclaims circulating in public. While some criticism regarding the performance of\njournalism during the crisis received mild empirical support, the analysis did\nnot find overwhelming signs of systemic dysfunctionalities. Overall,\njournalistic media did not default to a uniform reaction nor to sprawling,\ninformation-poor pandemic news, but they responded with a multi-perspective\ncoverage of the crisis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 May 2020 11:39:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 May 2020 15:28:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-29"}

In fact, high-bit accumulator leads to partially\nwasted computation and low-bit one typically suffers from numerical overflow.\nTo address this problem, we propose an overflow aware quantization method by\ndesigning trainable adaptive fixed-point representation, to optimize the number\nof bits for each input tensor while prohibiting numeric overflow during the\ncomputation.

Flares release free energy built up in coronal\nfields, which are rooted in active regions (ARs) on the photosphere, via\nmagnetic reconnection. The exact processes that lead to reconnection are not\nfully known and therefore reliable forecasting of flares is challenging.\nRecently, photospheric magnetic-field data has been extensively analysed using\nmachine learning (ML) and these studies suggest that flare-forecasting accuracy\ndoes not strongly depend on how long in advance flares are predicted (Bobra &\nCouvidat 2015; Raboonik et al. 2017; Huang et al. 2018). Here, we use ML to\nunderstand the evolution of AR magnetic fields before and after flares. We\nexplicitly train convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify SDO/HMI\nline-of-sight magnetograms into ARs producing at least one M- or X-class flare\nor as nonflaring. We find that flaring ARs remain in flare-productive states --\nmarked by recall >60% with a peak of ~ 80% -- days before and after flares. We\nuse occlusion maps and statistical analysis to show that the CNN pays attention\nto regions between the opposite polarities from ARs and the CNN output is\ndominantly decided by the total unsigned line-of-sight flux of ARs. Using\nsynthetic bipole magnetograms, we find spurious dependencies of the CNN output\non magnetogram dimensions for a given bipole size. Our results suggest that it\nis important to use CNN designs that eliminate such artifacts in CNN\napplications for processing magnetograms and, in general, solar image data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 May 2020 13:00:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-05"}

Group-theoretical\nmethods for studying large-amplitude atomic vibrations in molecular and crystal\nstructures were developed. Each bush represents a certain collection of\nvibrational modes, which do not change in time despite the time evolution of\nthese modes, and the energy of the initial excitation remains trapped in the\nbush. Any bush is characterized by its symmetry group, which is a subgroup of\nthe system's symmetry group.

Examples are strongly confined liquids for which the\ncurrents in lateral and longitudinal direction to the walls are very different,\nor fluids of nonspherical particles with distinct relaxation patterns for\ntranslational and rotational degrees of freedom. Here, we perform an asymptotic\nanalysis of the slow structural relaxation close to kinetic arrest as described\nby mode-coupling theory (MCT) with several relaxation channels. Compared to\nstandard MCT, the presence of multiple relaxation channels significantly\nchanges the structure of the underlying equations of motion and leads to\nadditional, non-trivial terms in the asymptotic solution. We show that the\nsolution can be rescaled, and thus prove that the well-known $ \\beta $-scaling\nequation of MCT remains valid even in the presence of multiple relaxation\nchannels. The asymptotic treatment is validated using a novel schematic model.\nWe demonstrate that the numerical solution of this schematic model can indeed\nbe described by the derived asymptotic scaling laws close to kinetic arrest.\nAdditionally, clear traces of the existence of two distinct decay channels are\nfound in the low-frequency susceptibility spectrum, suggesting that clear\nfootprints of the additional relaxation channels can in principle be detected\nin simulations or experiments of confined or molecular liquids.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 May 2020 13:23:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

State-of-the-art pixel labeling neural networks widely exploit\nconventional scale-transfer operations, i.e., up-sampling and down-sampling to\nlearn multi-scale features. In this work, we find that these operations lead to\nscale-confused features and suboptimal performance because they are\nspatial-invariant and directly transit all feature information cross scales\nwithout spatial selection. To address this issue, we propose the Gated\nScale-Transfer Operation (GSTO) to properly transit spatial-filtered features\nto another scale. Specifically, GSTO can work either with or without extra\nsupervision. Unsupervised GSTO is learned from the feature itself while the\nsupervised one is guided by the supervised probability matrix. Both forms of\nGSTO are lightweight and plug-and-play, which can be flexibly integrated into\nnetworks or modules for learning better multi-scale features.

To alleviate the burden\non the annotator, we propose a novel weakly supervised training framework that\nlearns from noisy pseudo labels generated from automatic vessel enhancement,\nrather than accurate labels obtained by fully manual annotation. A typical\nself-paced learning scheme is used to make the training process robust against\nlabel noise while challenged by the systematic biases in pseudo labels, thus\nleading to the decreased performance of CNNs at test time. To solve this\nproblem, we propose an annotation-refining self-paced learning framework\n(AR-SPL) to correct the potential errors using suggestive annotation. An\nelaborate model-vesselness uncertainty estimation is also proposed to enable\nthe minimal annotation cost for suggestive annotation, based on not only the\nCNNs in training but also the geometric features of coronary arteries derived\ndirectly from raw data. Experiments show that our proposed framework achieves\n1) comparable accuracy to fully supervised learning, which also significantly\noutperforms other weakly supervised learning frameworks; 2) largely reduced\nannotation cost, i.e., 75.18% of annotation time is saved, and only 3.46% of\nimage regions are required to be annotated; and 3) an efficient intervention\nprocess, leading to superior performance with even fewer manual interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 May 2020 13:55:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-19"}

Remedies in recent literature focus on\ndivide-and-conquer, e.g., partitioning into sub-problems and inducing\nfunctional (and thus computational) independence. Such approximations can be\nspeedy, accurate, and sometimes even more flexible than an ordinary GPs.\nHowever, a big downside is loss of continuity at partition boundaries. Modern\nmethods like local approximate GPs (LAGPs) imply effectively infinite\npartitioning and are thus pathologically good and bad in this regard. Model\naveraging, an alternative to divide-and-conquer, can maintain absolute\ncontinuity but often over-smooths, diminishing accuracy. Here we propose\nputting LAGP-like methods into a local experts-like framework, blending\npartition-based speed with model-averaging continuity, as a flagship example of\nwhat we call precision aggregated local models (PALM). Using $K$ LAGPs, each\nselecting $n$ from $N$ total data pairs, we illustrate a scheme that is at most\ncubic in $n$, quadratic in $K$, and linear in $N$, drastically reducing\ncomputational and storage demands. Extensive empirical illustration shows how\nPALM is at least as accurate as LAGP, can be much faster in terms of speed, and\nfurnishes continuous predictive surfaces.

We consider two\nuncertainty classes: discrete uncertainties which can take at each stage at\nmost a fixed number d of different values, and polytopic uncertainties which,\nat each stage, are elements of a convex hull of at most d points. Given the\ndepth mu of the decision rule, the decision at stage t is expressed as the sum\nof t functions of mu consecutive values of the underlying uncertain parameters.\nThese functions are arbitrary in the case of discrete uncertainties and are\npoly-affine in the case of polytopic uncertainties. For these uncertainty\nclasses, we show that when the uncertain right-hand sides of the constraints of\nthe multistage problem are of the same additive structure as the decision\nrules, these constraints can be reformulated as a system of linear inequality\nconstraints where the numbers of variables and constraints is O(1)(n+m)d^mu N^2\nwith n the maximal dimension of control variables, m the maximal number of\ninequality constraints at each stage, and N the number of stages.\n  As an illustration, we discuss an application of the proposed approach to a\nMultistage Stochastic Program arising in the problem of hydro-thermal\nproduction planning with interstage dependent inflows.

Two computational\ndomains were used: one containing a wedge of a single angle with a straight\nafter-body, and the other containing a double-angle wedge geometry. Both\ndomains were channels with a supersonic inflow of stoichiometric hydrogen-air\nand a nonreflecting outflow, and the wedge was modeled using an immersed\nboundary method. The compressible reactive Navier-Stokes equations were solved\nusing a high-order numerical algorithm on an adapting grid. Inviscid and\nviscous wedge surfaces were modeled using slip and no-slip adiabatic boundary\nconditions, respectively. Inviscid wedge surface cases are presented for a\nrange of inflow conditions and compared to previous work outlining several\ndifferent ODW structures. An ignition criterion is established as an accurate\nmethod of predicting the formation of an ODW for a given inflow temperature,\nMach number, wedge angle, and length of the inviscid wedge surface. A viscous\nwedge surface is then considered for a Mach 5 inflow at temperatures of 600 K,\n700 K, and 800 K. The 600 K flow ignites in the boundary layer, but does not\ndetonate, while the 700 K and 800 K flows ignite and form ODWs. It was\ndetermined that ODW formation depends on the degree of augmentation of the\nleading oblique shock wave by the burning boundary layer and that ODW formation\nis therefore predictable based on the ignition criterion. The 700 K flow\nproduces a unique oscillatory mode of a receding ODW followed by a redetonation\nevent occurring near the leading edge. A mechanism for this cycle, which\nrepeats indefinitely, is proposed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 May 2020 14:47:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-28"}

The availability of\nsuch powerful general-purpose search tools as SAT solvers has led many\nresearchers to propose SAT-based methods for cryptanalysis, including\ntechniques for finding collisions in hash functions and breaking symmetric\nencryption schemes. Most of the previously proposed SAT-based cryptanalysis\napproaches are blackbox techniques, in the sense that the cryptanalysis problem\nis encoded as a SAT instance and then a CDCL SAT solver is invoked to solve the\nsaid instance. A weakness of this approach is that the encoding thus generated\nmay be too large for any modern solver to solve efficiently. Perhaps a more\nimportant weakness of this approach is that the solver is in no way specialized\nor tuned to solve the given instance. To address these issues, we propose an\napproach called CDCL(Crypto) (inspired by the CDCL(T) paradigm in\nSatisfiability Modulo Theory solvers) to tailor the internal subroutines of the\nCDCL SAT solver with domain-specific knowledge about cryptographic primitives.\nSpecifically, we extend the propagation and conflict analysis subroutines of\nCDCL solvers with specialized codes that have knowledge about the cryptographic\nprimitive being analyzed by the solver.

Neural ODEs are ordinary differential equations\n(ODEs) with neural network components. Training a neural ODE is an optimal\ncontrol problem where the weights are the controls and the hidden features are\nthe states. Every training iteration involves solving an ODE forward and\nanother backward in time, which can require large amounts of computation, time,\nand memory. Comparing the Opt-Disc and Disc-Opt approaches in image\nclassification tasks, Gholami et al. (2019) suggest that Disc-Opt is preferable\ndue to the guaranteed accuracy of gradients. In this paper, we extend the\ncomparison to neural ODEs for time-series regression and CNFs. Unlike in\nclassification, meaningful models in these tasks must also satisfy additional\nrequirements beyond accurate final-time output, e.g., the invertibility of the\nCNF. Through our numerical experiments, we demonstrate that with careful\nnumerical treatment, Disc-Opt methods can achieve similar performance as\nOpt-Disc at inference with drastically reduced training costs. Disc-Opt reduced\ncosts in six out of seven separate problems with training time reduction\nranging from 39% to 97%, and in one case, Disc-Opt reduced training from nine\ndays to less than one day.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 May 2020 15:28:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 31 Jul 2020 00:28:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-03"}

It is quite simple to\ncome up with a complex meaning representation, but it is hard to design a\nsimple meaning representation that captures many nuances of meaning. This paper\nlists some lessons learned in nearly ten years of meaning annotation during the\ndevelopment of the Groningen Meaning Bank (Bos et al., 2017) and the Parallel\nMeaning Bank (Abzianidze et al., 2017). The paper's format is rather\nunconventional: there is no explicit related work, no methodology section, no\nresults, and no discussion (and the current snippet is not an abstract but\nactually an introductory preface). Instead, its structure is inspired by work\nof Traum (2000) and Bender (2013). The list starts with a brief overview of the\nexisting meaning banks (Section 1) and the rest of the items are roughly\ndivided into three groups: corpus collection (Section 2 and 3, annotation\nmethods (Section 4-11), and design of meaning representations (Section 12-30).\nWe hope this overview will give inspiration and guidance in creating improved\nmeaning banks in the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 May 2020 15:28:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-28"}

The situation is\ncompounded by the loss of depth information during perspective projection. We\npresent Center3D, a one-stage anchor-free approach, to efficiently estimate 3D\nlocation and depth using only monocular RGB images. By exploiting the\ndifference between 2D and 3D centers, we are able to estimate depth\nconsistently. Center3D uses a combination of classification and regression to\nunderstand the hidden depth information more robustly than each method alone.\nOur method employs two joint approaches: (1) LID: a classification-dominated\napproach with sequential Linear Increasing Discretization. (2) DepJoint: a\nregression-dominated approach with multiple Eigen's transformations for depth\nestimation. Evaluating on KITTI dataset for moderate objects, Center3D improved\nthe AP in BEV from $29.7\\%$ to $42.8\\%$, and the AP in 3D from $18.6\\%$ to\n$39.1\\%$. Compared with state-of-the-art detectors, Center3D has achieved the\nbest speed-accuracy trade-off in realtime monocular object detection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 May 2020 15:29:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-28"}

Optical generation\nof such metallic surfaces via BB on ultrafast timescales would facilitate a\ndrastic manipulation of the conduction, magnetic and optical properties of\nsemiconductors for high-speed electronics. Here, we demonstrate the ultrafast\ngeneration of a metal at the (10-10) surface of ZnO upon photoexcitation.\nCompared to hitherto known ultrafast photoinduced semiconductor-to-metal\ntransitions that occur in the bulk of inorganic semiconductors, the\nmetallization of the ZnO surface is launched by 3-4 orders of magnitude lower\nphoton fluxes. Using time- and angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy, we\nshow that the phase transition is caused by photoinduced downward surface band\nbending due to photodepletion of donor-type deep surface defects. At low photon\nflux, surface-confined excitons are formed. Above a critical exciton density, a\nMott transition occurs, leading to a partially filled metallic band below the\nequilibrium Fermi energy. This process is in analogy to chemical doping of\nsemiconductor surfaces. The discovered mechanism is not material-specific and\npresents a general route for controlling metallicity confined to semiconductor\ninterfaces on ultrafast timescales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 May 2020 15:30:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2020 10:38:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2021 07:47:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-16"}

The equation system of relevance, the\nVlasov-Maxwell-Fokker-Planck (VM-FP) system of equations, is difficult to\nnumerically integrate, and traditional methods such as the particle-in-cell\nmethod introduce counting noise into the distribution function.\n  In this thesis, we present a new algorithm for the discretization of VM-FP\nsystem of equations for the study of plasmas in the kinetic regime.

These structures with both premixed and\nnon-premixed flames are commonly seen in more practical combustion analyses. A\nrange of realistic mass mixture fractions and asymmetric chemical rate laws are\nexamined while avoiding the commonly forced unreal symmetric behavior with\none-step second-order kinetics. Moreover, a survey of critical parameters is\nperformed varying pressure and normal strain rate to define the flame structure\nand detect different characters. Three flames can co-exist if the strain rate\nis low enough and the pressure is high enough. However, at higher strain rate\nand/or lower pressure, only one or two flames might be obtained. Negative\nregions of heat release rate are observed and linked to potential endothermic\nreactions. With a rich premixed mixture at low strain rates and pressures, high\nexothermic reactions producing CO$_2$ and H$_2$O, and consuming CO and H$_2$\ncauses a heat-release-rate peak. Unexpected character of the lean and rich\npremixed flames is observed, leading to the conclusion that these flames are\ndiffusion-controlled.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 May 2020 02:07:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 2020 10:27:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 20 Jul 2020 22:44:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-22"}

Although many existing robotics studies use a\nforward model framework, there are generalization issues with high degrees of\nfreedom. The current study shows that the predictive coding (PC) and active\ninference (AIF) frameworks, which employ a generative model, can develop better\ngeneralization by learning a prior distribution in a low dimensional latent\nstate space representing probabilistic structures extracted from well\nhabituated sensory-motor trajectories. In our proposed model, learning is\ncarried out by inferring optimal latent variables as well as synaptic weights\nfor maximizing the evidence lower bound, while goal-directed planning is\naccomplished by inferring latent variables for maximizing the estimated lower\nbound. Our proposed model was evaluated with both simple and complex robotic\ntasks in simulation, which demonstrated sufficient generalization in learning\nwith limited training data by setting an intermediate value for a\nregularization coefficient. Furthermore, comparative simulation results show\nthat the proposed model outperforms a conventional forward model in\ngoal-directed planning, due to the learned prior confining the search of motor\nplans within the range of habituated trajectories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 May 2020 06:43:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-01"}

The decision-making algorithm is assumed to have no knowledge of\nthe number of anomalous processes. The algorithm is allowed to choose a subset\nof the sensors at each time instant until the confidence level on the decision\nexceeds the desired value. Our objective is to design a sequential sensor\nselection policy that dynamically determines which processes to observe at each\ntime and when to terminate the detection algorithm.
