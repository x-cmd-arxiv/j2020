The prevalent existence of cognitive\nbiases in large volumes of historical data can pose a threat of being\nmanifested as unethical and seemingly inhuman predictions as outputs of AI\nsystems trained on such data. To alleviate this problem, we propose a\nbias-aware multi-objective learning framework that given a set of identity\nattributes (e.g. gender, ethnicity etc.) and a subset of sensitive categories\nof the possible classes of prediction outputs, learns to reduce the frequency\nof predicting certain combinations of them, e.g. predicting stereotypes such as\n`most blacks use abusive language', or `fear is a virtue of women'. Our\nexperiments conducted on an emotion prediction task with balanced class priors\nshows that a set of baseline bias-agnostic models exhibit cognitive biases with\nrespect to gender, such as women are prone to be afraid whereas men are more\nprone to be angry. In contrast, our proposed bias-aware multi-objective\nlearning methodology is shown to reduce such biases in the predictied emotions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 May 2020 17:01:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2020 07:20:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-29"}

As DRL has achieved great\nsuccess in various complex tasks, designing effective adversarial attacks is an\nindispensable prerequisite towards building robust DRL algorithms. In this\npaper, we introduce two novel adversarial attack techniques to\n\\emph{stealthily} and \\emph{efficiently} attack the DRL agents. These two\ntechniques enable an adversary to inject adversarial samples in a minimal set\nof critical moments while causing the most severe damage to the agent. The\nfirst technique is the \\emph{critical point attack}: the adversary builds a\nmodel to predict the future environmental states and agent's actions, assesses\nthe damage of each possible attack strategy, and selects the optimal one. The\nsecond technique is the \\emph{antagonist attack}: the adversary automatically\nlearns a domain-agnostic model to discover the critical moments of attacking\nthe agent in an episode. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour techniques. Specifically, to successfully attack the DRL agent, our\ncritical point technique only requires 1 (TORCS) or 2 (Atari Pong and Breakout)\nsteps, and the antagonist technique needs fewer than 5 steps (4 Mujoco tasks),\nwhich are significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 May 2020 16:06:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-15"}

However, GCs\nborn outside the central regions of their hosts can have no/little DM after\ntheir hosts are destroyed and the GCs become the Galactic halo GCs. These\nresults suggest that only GCs originating from stellar nuclei of dwarfs can\npossibly have DM. We further calculate the expected $\\gamma$-ray emission from\nthese simulated GCs and compare them to observations of $\\omega$ Cen. Given the\nlarge range of DM densities in the simulated GCs, we suggest that the recent\npossible detection of DM annihilation from GCs should be more carefully\ninterpreted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 May 2020 16:53:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-20"}

We cast this problem as a\ndifferential game played between the dynamical system being controlled and the\nexternal system factor(s) for which observations are lost. The game is a\nzero-sum Stackelberg game in which the controlled system (leader) is trying to\nfind a trajectory which maximizes a function representing the safety of the\nsystem, and the unobserved factor (follower) is trying to minimize the same\nfunction. The set of winning initial configurations of this game for the\ncontrolled system represent the set of all states in which safety can be\nmaintained with respect to the external factor, even if observability of that\nfactor is lost.

A major\nsecurity concern is their probable abuse by adversaries towards their malicious\nintent. Understanding and analyzing IoT malicious behaviors is crucial,\nespecially with their rapid growth and adoption in wide-range of applications.\nHowever, recent studies have shown that machine learning-based approaches are\nsusceptible to adversarial attacks by adding junk codes to the binaries, for\nexample, with an intention to fool those machine learning or deep\nlearning-based detection systems.

To do so, examine the performance of the state-of-the-art\nmethods against adversarial IoT software crafted using the graph embedding and\naugmentation techniques.

Our comprehensive experimentation with GEA-based AEs show\nthe relation between misclassification and the graph size of the injected\nsample.

One consequence of this theorem is that the largest\nnumber of ontic states possible in any such model is given by the dimension of\nthe associated generalized probabilistic theory.

The protocol is based on\nindirect control of the environment via quantum measurements on quantum probes\ninteracting with the environment prior to the system that should be protected.\nNo direct manipulation with the environment is required to suppress the\ndecoherence. In our proof-of-principle experiment, we demonstrate protection of\na single qubit coupled to another single qubit.

Recently, Ye and Abbe [ICML 2018] proposed a\ncoding-theoretic paradigm to characterize a fundamental trade-off between\ncomputation load per worker, communication overhead per worker, and straggler\ntolerance. However, their proposed coding schemes suffer from heavy decoding\ncomplexity and poor numerical stability. In this paper, we develop a\ncommunication-efficient gradient coding framework to overcome these drawbacks.\nOur proposed framework enables using any linear code to design the encoding and\ndecoding functions. When a particular code is used in this framework, its\nblock-length determines the computation load, dimension determines the\ncommunication overhead, and minimum distance determines the straggler\ntolerance. The flexibility of choosing a code allows us to gracefully trade-off\nthe straggler threshold and communication overhead for smaller decoding\ncomplexity and higher numerical stability. Further, we show that using a\nmaximum distance separable (MDS) code generated by a random Gaussian matrix in\nour framework yields a gradient code that is optimal with respect to the\ntrade-off and, in addition, satisfies stronger guarantees on numerical\nstability as compared to the previously proposed schemes. Finally, we evaluate\nour proposed framework on Amazon EC2 and demonstrate that it reduces the\naverage iteration time by 16% as compared to prior gradient coding schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 May 2020 17:57:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-15"}

The challenge of seizure forecasting lies within the seemingly\nunpredictable transitions of brain dynamics into the ictal state. The main body\nof computational research on determining seizure risk has been focused solely\non prediction algorithms, which involves a remarkable issue of balancing\naccuracy and false-alarms. In this paper, we developed a seizure-risk warning\nsystem that employs Bayesian convolutional neural network (BCNN) to provide\nmeaningful information to the patient and provide a greater opportunity for\nhim/her to be potentially more in charge of his/her health.

The presence of these stationary clouds\nat the linear level is intimately linked to the existence of Kerr black holes\nwith synchronised hair at the non-linear level. These configurations are very\nsimilar to the atomic orbitals of the electron in a hydrogen atom.

Recently, the exponential\nsuppression of heating has also been observed in an experiment with ultracold\natoms, realizing a periodically driven Bose-Hubbard model. This model has an\nunbounded spectrum and, hence, is beyond the reach of previous theoretical\napproaches. Here, we study this model with two semiclassical approaches valid,\nrespectively, at large and weak interaction strengths. In both limits, we\ncompute the heating rates by studying the statistical probability to encounter\na many-body resonance, and obtain a quantitative agreement with the exact\ndiagonalization of the quantum model. Our approach demonstrates the relevance\nof statistical arguments to Floquet perthermalization of interacting many-body\nquantum systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 May 2020 18:00:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 May 2020 09:15:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 16 Jun 2020 16:41:06 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 17 Jun 2020 10:03:18 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 27 May 2021 08:28:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-25"}

To\nunderstand the physical properties involved in the leakage of LyC photons, we\ninvestigate the connection between the HI covering fraction, HI velocity width,\nthe Lyman alpha (LyA) properties and escape of LyC photons in a sample of 22\nstar-forming galaxies including 13 LCEs. We fit the stellar continua, dust\nattenuation, and absorption lines between 920 and 1300 A to extract the HI\ncovering fractions and dust attenuation. Additionally, we measure the HI\nvelocity widths of the optically thick Lyman series and derive the LyA\nequivalent widths (EW), escape fractions (fesc), peak velocities and fluxes at\nthe minimum of the LyA profiles. Overall, we highlight strong correlations\nbetween the presence of low HI covering fractions and (1) low LyA peak\nvelocities; (2) more flux at the profile minimum; and (3) larger EW(LyA),\nfesc(LyA), and fesc(LyC). Hence, low column density channels are crucial ISM\ningredients for the leakage of LyC and LyA photons. Additionally, galaxies with\nnarrower HI absorption velocity widths have higher LyA equivalent widths,\nlarger LyA escape fractions, and lower LyA peak velocity separations. This\nsuggests that these galaxies have low HI column density. Finally, we find that\ndust regulates the amount of LyA and LyC radiation that actually escapes the\nISM. Overall, the ISM porosity is one origin of strong LyA emission and enables\nthe escape of ionizing photons in low-z leakers. However, this is not enough to\nexplain the largest fesc(LyC) observed, which indicates that the most extreme\nLCEs are likely density-bounded along all lines of sight to the observer.\nOverall, the neutral gas porosity constrains a lower limit to the escape\nfraction of LyC and LyA photons, providing a key estimator of the leakage of\nionizing photons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 May 2020 18:24:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}

The nodal peak-dip-hump\nstructure appears to have a common doping-dependence in several single-layer\ncuprates, and is interpreted as a manifestation of pseudogap physics at the\nnode.

Unlike\nMutual-Information-Maximization Quantized Belief Propagation (MIM-QBP), RCQ can\napproximate either belief propagation or Min-Sum decoding. One problem faced by\nMIM-QBP decoder is that it cannot work well when the fraction of degree-2\nvariable nodes is large. However, sometimes a large fraction of degree-2\nvariable nodes is necessary for a fast encoding structure, as seen in the IEEE\n802.11 standard and the DVB-S2 standard. In contrast, the proposed RCQ decoder\nmay be applied to any off-the-shelf LDPC code, including those with a large\nfraction of degree-2 variable nodes.Our simulations show that a 4-bit Min-Sum\nRCQ decoder delivers frame error rate (FER) performance around 0.1dB of\nfull-precision belief propagation (BP) for the IEEE 802.11 standard LDPC code\nin the low SNR region.The RCQ decoder actually outperforms full-precision BP in\nthe high SNR region because it overcomes elementary trapping sets that create\nan error floor under BP decoding. This paper also introduces Hierarchical\nDynamic Quantization (HDQ) to design the non-uniform quantizers required by RCQ\ndecoders. HDQ is a low-complexity design technique that is slightly\nsub-optimal. Simulation results comparing HDQ and an optimal quantizer on the\nsymmetric binary-input memoryless additive white Gaussian noise channel show a\nloss in mutual information between these two quantizers of less than $10^{-6}$\nbits, which is negligible for practical applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 May 2020 21:09:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-18"}

The number of daily tests grows, while the daily fraction\nof confirmed cases to total tests has a change point. It (depending on region)\ngenerally increases with strong fluctuations till (around, depending on region)\n15th-22nd March and then decreases linearly after. Combined with the increasing\ntrend of daily performed tests, the raw confirmed case counts are not\nrepresentative of the situation and are confounded with the sampling effort.\nThis we observe when regressing on time the logged fraction of positive tests\nand for comparison the logged raw confirmed count. Hence, calibrating model\nparameters for this virus's dynamics should not be done based only on confirmed\ncase counts (without rescaling by the number of tests), but take also\nfatalities and hospitalization count under consideration as variables not prone\nto be distorted by testing efforts. Furthermore, reporting statistics on the\nnational level does not say much about the dynamics of the disease, which are\ntaking place at the regional level.

This includes epithelial tissues, which often\nnarrow and elongate in convergent extension movements due to anisotropies in\nexternal forces or in internal cell-generated forces. However, the mechanisms\nthat allow or prevent tissue reorganization, especially in the presence of\nstrongly anisotropic forces, remain unclear. We study this question in the\nconverging and extending Drosophila germband epithelium, which displays planar\npolarized myosin II and experiences anisotropic forces from neighboring\ntissues, and we show that in contrast to isotropic tissues, cell shape alone is\nnot sufficient to predict the onset of rapid cell rearrangement. From\ntheoretical considerations and vertex model simulations, we predict that in\nanisotropic tissues two experimentally accessible metrics of cell patterns, the\ncell shape index and a cell alignment index, are required to determine whether\nan anisotropic tissue is in a solid-like or fluid-like state. We show that\nchanges in cell shape and alignment over time in the Drosophila germband\npredict the onset of rapid cell rearrangement in both wild-type and snail twist\nmutant embryos, where our theoretical prediction is further improved when we\nalso account for cell packing disorder. These findings suggest that convergent\nextension is associated with a transition to more fluid-like tissue behavior,\nwhich may help accommodate tissue shape changes during rapid developmental\nevents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 14 May 2020 22:15:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-24"}

For instance, the existing LB studies\nshowed that the boiling on a hydrophobic surface begins at a lower wall\nsuperheat than that on a hydrophilic surface, which qualitatively agrees well\nwith experimental studies, but no one has yet explained how this phenomenon\nappears in the LB simulations and what happened in the simulations after\nchanging the wettability of the heating surface. In this paper, the LB boiling\nmechanism is revealed by analyzing boiling on a flat surface with mixed\nwettability and boiling on a structured surface with homogeneous wettability.\nThrough a theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that, when the same wall\nsuperheat is applied, in the LB boiling simulations the fluid density near the\nheating surface decreases faster on a hydrophobic surface than that on a\nhydrophilic surface. Accordingly, a lower wall superheat can induce the phase\ntransition from liquid to vapor on a hydrophobic surface than that on a\nhydrophilic surface. Furthermore, a similar theoretical analysis shows that the\nfluid density decreases fastest at concave corners in the case of a structured\nsurface with homogeneous wettability, which explains why vapor bubbles are\nnucleated at concave corners in the LB simulations of boiling on structured\nsurfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 May 2020 02:17:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 May 2020 23:37:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-10"}

Trojan detection is of paramount\nimportance for ensuring systems with confidentiality, integrity, and\navailability. Existing methods for hardware Trojan detection in FPGA (field\nprogrammable gate array) devices include test-time methods, pre-implementation\nmethods, and run-time methods. The first two methods provide effective ways of\ndetecting some Trojans; however, Trojans may be specifically designed to avoid\ndetection at test-time or before implementation making run-time detection a\nmore attractive option. Run-time detection and removal of Trojans is highly\ndesirable due to the wide range of critical systems which are deployed on FPGAs\nand may be difficult or costly to remove from operation. Many parallels can be\ndrawn between hardware and natural systems, and one example creates an analogy\nbetween hardware attacks and biological attacks.

The flexibility of CADEFT\noriginates in the CRISPR-Cas mechanism's ability to recognize similar albeit\npreviously unseen patterns which may pose a threat to the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 May 2020 03:05:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-18"}

Existing single image high\ndynamic range (HDR) reconstruction methods attempt to expand the range of\nluminance, but are not able to hallucinate plausible textures, producing\nresults with artifacts in the saturated areas. In this paper, we present a\nnovel learning-based approach to reconstruct an HDR image by recovering the\nsaturated pixels of an input LDR image in a visually pleasing way. Previous\ndeep learning-based methods apply the same convolutional filters on\nwell-exposed and saturated pixels, creating ambiguity during training and\nleading to checkerboard and halo artifacts. To overcome this problem, we\npropose a feature masking mechanism that reduces the contribution of the\nfeatures from the saturated areas. Moreover, we adapt the VGG-based perceptual\nloss function to our application to be able to synthesize visually pleasing\ntextures. Since the number of HDR images for training is limited, we propose to\ntrain our system in two stages. Specifically, we first train our system on a\nlarge number of images for image inpainting task and then fine-tune it on HDR\nreconstruction. Since most of the HDR examples contain smooth regions that are\nsimple to reconstruct, we propose a sampling strategy to select challenging\ntraining patches during the HDR fine-tuning stage. We demonstrate through\nexperimental results that our approach can reconstruct visually pleasing HDR\nresults, better than the current state of the art on a wide range of scenes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 May 2020 03:13:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-18"}

Unfortunately, single light\nintensity modelling is hard to accurately simulate visual perception\ninformation, leading to the problems of imbalanced visual photosensitivity and\nweak adaptivity. To solve these problems, we explore the precise relationship\nbetween light source and visual perception and then propose the visual\nperception (VP) model to acquire a precise mathematical description of visual\nperception. The core of VP model is to decompose the light source into light\nintensity and light spatial distribution to describe the perception process of\nHVS, offering refinement estimation of illumination and reflectance. To reduce\ncomplexity of the estimation process, we introduce the rapid and adaptive\n$\\mathbf{\\beta}$ and $\\mathbf{\\gamma}$ functions to build an illumination and\nreflectance estimation scheme. Finally, we present a optimal determination\nstrategy, consisting of a \\emph{cycle operation} and a \\emph{comparator}.\nSpecifically, the \\emph{comparator} is responsible for determining the optimal\nenhancement results from multiple enhanced results through implementing the\n\\emph{cycle operation}. By coordinating the proposed VP model, illumination and\nreflectance estimation scheme, and the optimal determination strategy, we\npropose a rapid and adaptive framework for low-light image enhancement.\nExtensive experiment results demenstrate that the proposed method achieves\nbetter performance in terms of visual comparison, quantitative assessment, and\ncomputational efficiency, compared with the currently state-of-the-arts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 May 2020 03:47:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-18"}

However, several important questions remain unanswered, such as (i)\nwhether the Gaussian mechanism is an appropriate option for certifying\n$\\ell_2$-norm robustness, and (ii) whether there is an appropriate randomized\n(smoothing) mechanism to certify $\\ell_\\infty$-norm robustness. To shed light\non these questions, we argue that the main difficulty is how to assess the\nappropriateness of each randomized mechanism. In this paper, we propose a\ngeneric framework that connects the existing frameworks in\n\\cite{lecuyer2018certified, li2019certified}, to assess randomized mechanisms.\nUnder our framework, for a randomized mechanism that can certify a certain\nextent of robustness, we define the magnitude of its required additive noise as\nthe metric for assessing its appropriateness. We also prove lower bounds on\nthis metric for the $\\ell_2$-norm and $\\ell_\\infty$-norm cases as the criteria\nfor assessment. Based on our framework, we assess the Gaussian and Exponential\nmechanisms by comparing the magnitude of additive noise required by these\nmechanisms and the lower bounds (criteria).

It is understood without controversy that this fabrication is a\ndifficult exercise and that a multilayer (ML) structure is suitable for such\nfabrication only in a narrow parameter range. This parameter range is sought by\nvarying both the stoichiometric SiC barrier thickness and the Si-rich SiC well\nthickness between 3 and 9 nm and comparing them to single layers (SL). The\nsamples processed for this investigation were deposited by plasma-enhanced\nchemical vapor deposition (PECVD) and subsequently subjected to thermal\nannealing at 1000-1100${\\deg}$C for crystal formation. Bulk information about\nthe entire sample area and depth were obtained by structural and optical\ncharacterization methods: information about the mean Si NC size was determined\nfrom grazing incidence X-ray diffraction (GIXRD) measurements.\nFourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was applied to gain insight into\nthe structure of the Si-C network, and spectrophotometry measurements were\nperformed to investigate the absorption coefficient and to estimate the bandgap\n$E_{04}$. All measurements showed that the influence of the ML structure on the\nSi NC size, on the Si-C network and on the absorption properties is subordinate\nto the influence of the overall Si content in the samples, which we identified\nas the key parameter for the structural and optical properties. We attribute\nthis behavior to interdiffusion of the barrier and well layers. Because the\nproduced Si NC are within the target size range of 2-4 nm for all layer\nthickness variations, we propose to use the Si content to adjust the Si NC size\nin future experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 May 2020 06:58:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-18"}

A significant reduction in\nthe annealing time may suppress the crystallization of the SiC matrix while\nmaintaining the formation of Si NC. In this study, we investigated the\ncrystallization of stoichiometric SiC and Si-rich SiC using conventional rapid\nthermal annealing (RTA) and nonequilibrium millisecond range flash lamp\nannealing (FLA). The investigated Si$_x$C$_{1-x}$ films were prepared by\nplasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition and annealed at temperatures from\n700${\\deg}$C to 1100${\\deg}$C for RTA and at flash energies between 34 J/cm$^2$\nand 62 J/cm$^2$ for FLA. GIXRD and FTIR were conducted to investigate hydrogen\neffusion, Si and SiC NC growth, and SiC crystallinity. Both the Si content and\nthe choice of the annealing process affect the crystallization behavior. It is\nshown that under certain conditions, FLA can be successfully utilized for the\nformation of Si NC in a SiC matrix, which closely resembles Si NC in a SiC\nmatrix achieved by RTA.

Under these conditions, FLA\nsucceeds in producing Si NC of a given size in less crystalline SiC than RTA\ndoes. This result is discussed in terms of nucleation and crystal growth using\nclassical crystallization theory. For FLA and RTA samples, an opposite\nrelationship between NC size and Si content was observed and attributed either\nto the dependence of H effusion on Si content or to the optical absorption\nproperties of the materials, which also depend on the Si content.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 May 2020 08:20:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-18"}

With live\nSimultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), there is a risk of\nmislocalization, since no ground truth map is used as a reference and errors\naccumulate over time. Therefore, we first build up and save a map of visual\nfeatures of the environment at low driving speeds with our extension to the\nORB-SLAM\\,2 package. In a second run, we reload the map and then localize on\nthe previously built-up map. Loading and localizing on a previously built map\ncan improve the continuous localization accuracy for autonomous vehicles in\ncomparison to a full SLAM.

Key to the success of these is the selection of an\napproximation to the target density that is accurate, tractable and fast to\ncalibrate using optimization methods. Most existing choices can be inaccurate\nor slow to calibrate when there are many latent variables. Here, we propose a\nfamily of tractable variational approximations that are more accurate and\nfaster to calibrate for this case.

Our approach enhances current 2D object detection networks\nby fusing camera data and projected sparse radar data in the network layers.\nThe proposed CameraRadarFusionNet (CRF-Net) automatically learns at which level\nthe fusion of the sensor data is most beneficial for the detection result.\nAdditionally, we introduce BlackIn, a training strategy inspired by Dropout,\nwhich focuses the learning on a specific sensor type. We show that the fusion\nnetwork is able to outperform a state-of-the-art image-only network for two\ndifferent datasets.

As racecars have been a\ndevelopment platform for technology that has later also been transferred to\npassenger vehicles, a race format for autonomous electric racecars called\nRoborace has been created. As electric racecars only store a limited amount of\nenergy, an Energy Management Strategy (EMS) is needed to work out the time as\nwell as the minimum energy trajectories for the track.

Their\ntorsion and curvature are defined, however, in general, they are not tensors. A\nspecial class of such generalised connections, referred to as odd connections\nin this paper, have torsion and curvature tensors. Part of the structure is an\nodd involution of the tangent bundle of the supermanifold and this puts drastic\nrestrictions on the supermanifolds that admit odd connections. In particular,\nthey must have equal number of even and odd dimensions. Amongst other results,\nwe show that an odd connection is defined, up to an odd tensor field of type\n$(1,2)$, by an affine connection and an odd endomorphism of the tangent bundle.\nThus, the theory of odd connections and affine connections are not completely\nseparate theories. As an example relevant to physics, it is shown that $N= 1$\nsuper-Minkowski spacetime admits a natural odd connection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 May 2020 09:59:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 May 2020 06:23:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 21 Sep 2020 07:01:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-29"}

Classical wave optics suggests a\nlinear relationship between FWHM and resolution also manifested in the well\nknown Abbe and Rayleigh criteria, dating back to the end of 19th century.\nHowever, during the last two decades conventional light microscopy has\nundergone a shift from microscopic scales to nanoscales. This increase in\nresolution comes with the need to incorporate the random nature of observations\n(light photons) and challenges the classical view of discernability, as we\nargue in this paper. Instead, we suggest a statistical description of\nresolution obtained from such random data. Our notion of discernability is\nbased on statistical testing whether one or two objects with the same total\nintensity are present. For Poisson measurements we get linear dependence of the\n(minimax) detection boundary on the FWHM, whereas for a homogeneous Gaussian\nmodel the dependence of resolution is nonlinear. Hence, at small physical\nscales modeling by homogeneous gaussians is inadequate, although often\nimplicitly assumed in many reconstruction algorithms. In contrast, the Poisson\nmodel and its variance stabilized Gaussian approximation seem to provide a\nstatistically sound description of resolution at the nanoscale. Our theory is\nalso applicable to other imaging setups, such as telescopes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 May 2020 09:59:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Oct 2020 07:27:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-23"}

The danger is posed by the presence in\nthe network of a black hole BH, a harmful site that destroys all incoming\nagents without leaving any trace. The problem of determining the location of\nthe black hole in a network, known as black hole search BHS, has been\nextensively studied in the literature, but always and only assuming that the\nnetwork is static. At the same time, the existing results on mobile agents\ncomputing in dynamic networks never consider the presence of harmful sites.\n  In this paper we start filling this research gap by studying black hole\nsearch in temporal rings, specifically focusing on 1-interval connectivity\nadversarial dynamics. The problem is solved if within finite time at least one\nagent survives and knows the location of BH. The main complexity parameters of\nBHS is the number of agents (called size) needed to solve the problem, and the\nnumber of moves (called cost) performed by the agents; in synchronous systems,\nsuch as temporal rings, an additional complexity measure is the amount of time\nuntil termination occurs.\n  Feasibility and complexity depend on many parameters; in particular: whether\nthe agents start from the same safe node or from possibly distinct safe\nlocations, the size $n$ of the ring, whether or not $n$ is known, and the type\nof inter-agent communication (whiteboards, tokens, face-to-face, visual). In\nthis paper, we provide a complete feasibility characterization for all\ninstances of those parameters; all our algorithms are size optimal.\nFurthermore, we establish lower bounds on the cost (i.e., the number of moves)\nand time of size-optimal solutions for all instances of those parameters and\nshow that our algorithms achieve those bound.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 May 2020 10:06:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 1 Aug 2020 19:43:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-04"}

Relied on tools from stochastic geometry, we\nderive a lower bound on the downlink average achievable spectral efficiency\n(SE). Next, we consider a realistic power consumption model for CF massive MIMO\nsystems. These steps enable the formulation of a tractable optimization problem\nconcerning the downlink EE per unit area, which results in the analytical\ndetermination of the optimal pilot reuse factor, the AP density, and the number\nof AP antennas and users that maximize the EE. Notably, the EE per unit area\nand not just the EE is the necessary metric to describe CF systems, where we\nmeet multi-point transmission. Hence, we provide useful design guidelines for\nCF massive MIMO systems relating to fundamental system variables towards\noptimal EE. Among the results, we observe that a lower pilot reuse factor\nenables a decrease of the interference, and subsequently, higher EE up to a\nspecific value.

We studied this problem from the perspective of reliability\nengineering in which a given risk of an accident has severity and probability\nof occurring.

Here, we present a comprehensive study of point\ndefects in monolayer tungsten disulfide (WS$_2$) grown by chemical vapor\ndeposition (CVD) using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, CO-tip\nnoncontact atomic force microscopy, Kelvin probe force spectroscopy, density\nfunctional theory, and tight-binding calculations. We observe four different\nsubstitutional defects: chromium (Cr$_{\\text{W}}$) and molybdenum\n(Mo$_{\\text{W}}$) at a tungsten site, oxygen at sulfur sites in both bottom and\ntop layers (O$_{\\text{S}}$ top/bottom), as well as two negatively charged\ndefects (CDs). Their electronic fingerprints unambiguously corroborate the\ndefect assignment and reveal the presence or absence of in-gap defect states.\nThe important role of charge localization, spin-orbit coupling, and strain for\nthe formation of deep defect states observed at substitutional defects in\nWS$_2$ as reported here will guide future efforts of targeted defect\nengineering and doping of TMDs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 May 2020 10:51:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-18"}

It is important to design proper techniques to represent\nconvex shapes. So far, it is still a problem to guarantee that the output\nobjects from a Deep Neural Convolution Networks (DCNN) are convex shapes. In\nthis work, we propose a technique which can be easily integrated into the\ncommonly used DCNNs for image segmentation and guarantee that outputs are\nconvex shapes. This method is flexible and it can handle multiple objects and\nallow some of the objects to be convex. Our method is based on the dual\nrepresentation of the sigmoid activation function in DCNNs. In the dual space,\nthe convex shape prior can be guaranteed by a simple quadratic constraint on a\nbinary representation of the shapes. Moreover, our method can also integrate\nspatial regularization and some other shape prior using a soft thresholding\ndynamics (STD) method. The regularization can make the boundary curves of the\nsegmentation objects to be simultaneously smooth and convex. We design a very\nstable active set projection algorithm to numerically solve our model. This\nalgorithm can form a new plug-and-play DCNN layer called CS-STD whose outputs\nmust be a nearly binary segmentation of convex objects. In the CS-STD block,\nthe convexity information can be propagated to guide the DCNN in both forward\nand backward propagation during training and prediction process. As an\napplication example, we apply the convexity prior layer to the retinal fundus\nimages segmentation by taking the popular DeepLabV3+ as a backbone network.\nExperimental results on several public datasets show that our method is\nefficient and outperforms the classical DCNN segmentation methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 May 2020 11:36:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-18"}

We review two interpretations of inference after selection: the full\nmodel view, in which the parameters of interest are those of the full model on\nall predictors, and then focus on the submodel view, in which the parameters of\ninterest are those of the selected model only. In the context of L1-penalized\nregression we compare proposals for submodel inference (selective inference)\nvia confidence intervals available to applied researchers via software packages\nusing a simulation study inspired by real data commonly seen in biomedical\nstudies. Furthermore, we present an exemplary application of these methods to a\npublicly available dataset to discuss their practical usability.

Naturally, research on this topic has focused on two and\nthree-dimensional superfluids, in which vortex cores form points and lines,\nrespectively. Very recently, however, there has been growing interest in the\nquantum simulation of systems with four spatial dimensions; this raises the\nquestion of how vortices would behave in a higher-dimensional superfluid. In\nthis paper, we begin to establish the phenomenology of vortices in 4D\nsuperfluids under rotation, where the vortex core can form a plane. In 4D, the\nmost generic type of rotation is a \"double rotation\" with two angles (or\nfrequencies). We show, by solving the Gross-Pitaesvkii equation, that the\nsimplest case of equal-frequency double rotation can stabilise a pair of vortex\nplanes intersecting at a point. This opens up a wide number of future research\ntopics, including unequal-frequency double rotations; the stability and\nreconnection dynamics of intersecting vortex surfaces; and the possibility of\nclosed vortex surfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 May 2020 12:10:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 May 2021 14:04:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-21"}

Unfortunately,\nexisting attacks mostly focused on feature-space and/or white-box attacks,\nwhich make impractical assumptions in real-world scenarios, leaving the study\non practical gray/black-box attacks largely unexplored.\n  To bridge this gap, we conduct the first systematic study of the\ngray/black-box traffic-space adversarial attacks to evaluate the robustness of\nML-based NIDSs.

Based on this, we also propose a defense scheme\nagainst adversarial attacks to improve system robustness.

First, the different types of applications are pointed out, from\n(noncommutative) quantum field theory over 2-dimensional quantum gravity up to\nalgebraic geometry with explicit computation of intersection numbers on the\nmoduli space of complex curves.\n  The Kontsevich model, which has proved the Witten conjecture, is the simplest\nexample of a matrix field theory. Generalisations of this model will be\nstudied, where different potentials and the spectral dimension (defined by the\nasymptotics of the external matrix) are introduced. Because they are naturally\nembedded into a Riemann surface, the correlation functions are graded by the\ngenus and the number of boundary components. The renormalisation procedure of\nquantum field theory leads to finite UV-limit.\n  We provide a method to determine closed Schwinger-Dyson equations with the\nusage of Ward-Takahashi identities in the continuum limit. The cubic\n(Kontsevich model) and the quartic (Grosse-Wulkenhaar model) potentials are\nstudied separately. For the cubic potential, we show that the renormalisation\nprocedure is compatible with topological recursion (TR). This means that the\nexact results computed by TR coincide perturbatively with the graph expansion\nrenormalised by Zimmermann's forest formula.

It is also a textbook example of a compound that exhibits\nmagnetically hidden order -- a low-temperature magnetic phase with ordered\nquadrupolar moments. It is difficult to identify the symmetry of such\nhidden-order states in common x-ray or neutron scattering experiments, as there\nis no signal in zero field, however alternative techniques like neutron\ndiffraction in external field, resonant x-ray scattering, or ultrasonic\ninvestigations can be applied. Another possible method for characterizing\nhidden order is to look at the magnetic excitation spectrum, which carries the\nimprint of the multipolar interactions and the hidden order parameter in its\ndispersion relations. Using a specific candidate model, the dispersion is\ncalculated and then compared to that measured with inelastic neutron\nscattering. Until recently, only a limited amount of data which show the\npresence of dispersing excitations measured along a few high-symmetry\ndirections in an applied magnetic field were available. Early attempts to\ncompare such calculations with experiments showed that only strongest modes at\nhigh-symmetry points could be identified. The present review of the most recent\nneutron-scattering results is intended to satisfy the need of more accurate\ninelastic neutron-scattering experiments as a function of field and\ntemperature, giving us the opportunity to identify existing excitation branches\nin CeB6 and conclusively compare them with the theoretically predicted\nmultipolar excitations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 May 2020 13:17:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-13"}

In this paper we focus on a\nsetting in which goal tasks are defined via simple sparse rewards, and\nexploration is facilitated via agent-internal auxiliary tasks. We introduce the\nidea of simple sensor intentions (SSIs) as a generic way to define auxiliary\ntasks. SSIs reduce the amount of prior knowledge that is required to define\nsuitable rewards.

However, a path may not have sufficient capacity to\nroute a transaction. It is inevitable to split the payment across multiple\npaths. If we run independent instances of the protocol on each path, the\nexecution may fail in some of the paths, leading to partial transfer of funds.\nA payer has to reattempt the entire process for the residual amount. We propose\na secure and privacy-preserving payment protocol, CryptoMaze. Instead of\nindependent paths, the funds are transferred from sender to receiver across\nseveral payment channels responsible for routing, in a breadth-first fashion.\nPayments are resolved faster at reduced setup cost, compared to existing\nstate-of-the-art. Correlation among the partial payments is captured,\nguaranteeing atomicity. Further, two party ECDSA signature is used for\nestablishing scriptless locks among parties involved in the payment.

To account for these biological and structural\ncontributions to cell shape, different physical models have been proposed.\nHowever, an experimental procedure that would allow a validation of a minimal\nphysical model for the shape of epithelial cells in 3D has not yet been\nproposed. In this study, we cultured MDCK epithelial cells on substrates with a\nsinusoidal profile, allowing us to measure the shape of the cells on various\npositive and negative curvatures. We found that MDCK cells are thicker in the\nvalleys than on the crests of sinusoidal substrates. The influence of curvature\non the shape of epithelial cells could not be understood with a model using\nonly differential apical, basal and lateral surface energies. However, the\naddition of an apical line tension was sufficient to quantitatively account for\nthe experimental measurements. The model also accounts for the shape of MDCK\ncells that overexpress E-cadherin. On the other hand, when reducing myosin II\nactivity with blebbistatin, we measured a saturation of the difference in cell\nthickness between valleys and crests, suggesting the need for a term limiting\nlarge cell deformations. Our results show that a minimal model that accounts\nfor epithelial cell shape needs to include an apical line tension in addition\nto differential surface energies, highlighting the importance of structures\nthat produce anisotropic tension in epithelial cells, such as the actin belt\nlinking adherens junctions.

Previous studies have focused on modelling possible restarting\nscenarios at the national level, overlooking the fact that Italy, as other\nnations around the world, is divided in administrative regions who can\nindependently oversee their own share of the Italian National Health Service.\nIn this study, we show that regionalism, and heterogeneity between regions, is\nessential to understand the spread of the epidemic and, more importantly, to\ndesign effective post Lock-Down strategies to control the disease. To achieve\nthis, we model Italy as a network of regions and parameterize the model of each\nregion on real data spanning almost two months from the initial outbreak. Using\nthe model, we confirm the effectiveness at the regional level of the national\nlockdown strategy implemented so far by the Italian government to mitigate the\nspread of the disease and show its efficacy at the regional level. We also\npropose that differentiated, albeit coordinated, regional interventions can be\neffective in Phase 2 to restart the country and avoid future recurrence of the\nepidemic, while avoiding saturation of the regional health systems and\nmitigating impact on costs. Our study and methodology can be easily extended to\nother levels of granularity (provinces or counties in the same region or states\nin other federal countries, etc.) to support policy- and decision-makers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 May 2020 15:30:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-18"}

In particular, we used\nunconscious state during a nap; because sleep is the only state in which\nconsciousness disappears under normal physiological conditions. Seven\nparticipants performed two memory tasks (word-pairs and visuo-spatial) before\nand after the nap to assess the memory consolidation during unconsciousness. As\na result, spindle power in central, parietal, occipital regions during\nunconsciousness was positively correlated with the performance of location\nmemory.

The\nbasis is taken to be conceptual variables, physical variables that may be\naccessible or inaccessible, i.e., it may be possible or impossible to assign\nnumerical values to them. In an epistemic process, the accessible variables are\njust ideal observations as observed by an actor or by some communicating\nactors. Group actions are defined on these variables, and using group\nrepresentation theory this is the basis for developing the Hilbert space\nformalism here. Operators corresponding to accessible conceptual variables are\nderived as a result of the formalism, and in the discrete case it is argued\nthat the possible physical values are the eigenvalues of these operators. The\nBorn formula is derived under specific assumptions. The whole discussion here\nis a supplement to the author's book [1]. The interpretation of quantum states\n(or eigenvector spaces) implied by this approach is as focused questions to\nnature together with sharp answers to those questions. Resolutions if the\nidentity are then connected to the questions themselves; these may be\ncomplementary in the sense defined by Bohr. This interpretation may be called a\ngeneral epistemic interpretation of quantum theory. It is similar to Zwirn's\nrecent Convival Solipsism, and also to QBism, and more generally, can be seen\nas a concrete implementation of Rovelli's Relational Quantum Mechanics. The\nfocus in the present paper is, however, as much on foundation as on\ninterpretation. But the simple consequences of an epistemic interpretation for\nsome so called quantum paradoxes are discussed. Connections to statistical\ninference theory are discussed in a preliminary way, both through an example\nand through a brief discussion of quantum measurement theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 May 2020 08:08:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-19"}

The superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of the MKID\nis an important parameter because various MKID characterization parameters\ndepend on it. In this paper, we propose a method to measure the Tc of the MKID\nby changing the applied power of the readout microwaves. A small fraction of\nthe readout power is deposited in the MKID, and the number of quasiparticles in\nthe MKID increases with this power. Furthermore, the quasiparticle lifetime\ndecreases with the number of quasiparticles. Therefore, we can measure the\nrelation between the quasiparticle lifetime and the detector response by\nrapidly varying the readout power. From this relation, we estimate the\nintrinsic quasiparticle lifetime. This lifetime is theoretically modeled by Tc,\nthe physical temperature of the MKID device, and other known parameters. We\nobtain Tc by comparing the measured lifetime with that acquired using the\ntheoretical model. Using an MKID fabricated with aluminum, we demonstrate this\nmethod at a 0.3 K operation. The results are consistent with those obtained by\nTc measured by monitoring the transmittance of the readout microwaves with the\nvariation in the device temperature.

It is unclear if workers receive the same\nbenefits from their relationships with AI systems, raising the question: What\ndegree does the relationship between AI systems and workers impact worker\noutcomes? We draw on IT identity to understand the influence of identification\nwith AI systems on job performance. From this theoretical perspective, we\npropose a research model and conduct a survey of 97 MTurk workers to test the\nmodel. The findings reveal that work role identity and organizational identity\nare key determinants of identification with AI systems. Furthermore, the\nfindings show that identification with AI systems does increase job\nperformance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 May 2020 10:59:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-26"}

Recent trends in high-tech applications of\nFRP composites exploit the limits of the load bearing capacity, generally\nencompassing the development of notable nonlinear effects from geometrical and\nmaterial signatures. In this investigation, we present a comprehensive\nassessment of the new Linear Elastic Brittle Interface Model (LEBIM) in\ngeometrically nonlinear applications undergoing mixed-mode fracture conditions.\nThis interface model for triggering fracture events is formulated through the\nadvocation of continuum-like assumptions (for initial non-zero interface\nthickness) and allows the incorporation of the potential role of the in-plane\ndeformation effects. The performance of the present interface model is\ndemonstrated through the simulation of specimens with mixed-mode delamination,\nwith special attention for its application in samples equipped with structured\ninterfaces. Current predictions exhibit an excellent agreement with respect to\nexperimental data, validating the proposed methodology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 May 2020 12:17:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-28"}

We derive non-linear orthotropic models for the\nelastic response, stress relaxation and residual strain in order to model\naccurately the inelastic features associated with cyclic stress softening.
