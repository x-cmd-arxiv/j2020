In this paper, we propose a fast image segmentation method based\non a novel super boundary-to-pixel direction (super-BPD) and a customized\nsegmentation algorithm with super-BPD. Precisely, we define BPD on each pixel\nas a two-dimensional unit vector pointing from its nearest boundary to the\npixel. In the BPD, nearby pixels from different regions have opposite\ndirections departing from each other, and adjacent pixels in the same region\nhave directions pointing to the other or each other (i.e., around medial\npoints). We make use of such property to partition an image into super-BPDs,\nwhich are novel informative superpixels with robust direction similarity for\nfast grouping into segmentation regions. Extensive experimental results on\nBSDS500 and Pascal Context demonstrate the accuracy and efficency of the\nproposed super-BPD in segmenting images. In practice, the proposed super-BPD\nachieves comparable or superior performance with MCG while running at ~25fps\nvs. 0.07fps. Super-BPD also exhibits a noteworthy transferability to unseen\nscenes.

With the popularity of convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs), computer-aided diagnosis of cancer has attracted considerable\nattention. Such tools are easily deployable and are cost-effective. Hence,\nthese can enable extensive coverage of cancer diagnostic facilities. However,\nthe development of such a tool for ALL cancer was challenging so far due to the\nnon-availability of a large training dataset. The visual similarity between the\nmalignant and normal cells adds to the complexity of the problem. This paper\ndiscusses the recent release of a large dataset and presents a novel deep\nlearning architecture for the classification of cell images of ALL cancer. The\nproposed architecture, namely, SDCT-AuxNet$^{\\theta}$ is a 2-module framework\nthat utilizes a compact CNN as the main classifier in one module and a Kernel\nSVM as the auxiliary classifier in the other one. While CNN classifier uses\nfeatures through bilinear-pooling, spectral-averaged features are used by the\nauxiliary classifier. Further, this CNN is trained on the stain deconvolved\nquantity images in the optical density domain instead of the conventional RGB\nimages. A novel test strategy is proposed that exploits both the classifiers\nfor decision making using the confidence scores of their predicted class\nlabels. Elaborate experiments have been carried out on our recently released\npublic dataset of 15114 images of ALL cancer and healthy cells to establish the\nvalidity of the proposed methodology that is also robust to subject-level\nvariability.

We identify 1508 DA white dwarfs with pure hydrogen\natmospheres. The DA mass distribution has an extremely narrow peak at\n$0.59~M_{\\odot}$, and reveals a shoulder from relatively massive white dwarfs\nwith $M=0.7$-$0.9~M_{\\odot}$. Comparing this distribution with binary\npopulation synthesis models, we find that the contribution from single stars\nthat form through mergers cannot explain the over-abundance of massive white\ndwarfs. In addition, the mass distribution of cool DAs shows a near absence of\n$M>1~M_{\\odot}$ white dwarfs. The pile-up of 0.7-$0.9~M_{\\odot}$ and the\ndisappearance of $M>1~M_{\\odot}$ white dwarfs is consistent with the effects of\ncore crystallization. Even though the evolutionary models predict the location\nof the pile-up correctly, the delay from the latent heat of crystallization by\nitself is insufficient to create a significant pile-up, and additional cooling\ndelays from related effects like phase separation are necessary. We also\ndiscuss the population of infrared-faint (ultracool) white dwarfs, and\ndemonstrate for the first time the existence of a well defined sequence in\ncolor and magnitude. Curiously, this sequence is connected to a region in the\ncolor-magnitude diagrams where the number of helium-dominated atmosphere white\ndwarfs is low.

However, there are limited software-based methods\n(hardware-based methods are expensive requiring hardware level changes) for\nobtaining the power consumed by containers for facilitating power-aware\ncontainer scheduling, an essential activity for efficient management of\ndistributed systems. This paper presents WattsApp, a tool underpinned by a six\nstep software-based method for power-aware container scheduling to minimize\npower cap violations on a server. The proposed method relies on a neural\nnetwork-based power estimation model and a power capped container scheduling\ntechnique. Experimental studies are pursued in a lab-based environment on 10\nbenchmarks deployed on Intel and ARM processors. The results highlight that the\npower estimation model has negligible overheads for data collection - nearly\n90% of all data samples can be estimated with less than a 10% error, and the\nMean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) is less than 6%. The power-aware\nscheduling of WattsApp is more effective than Intel's Running Power Average\nLimit (RAPL) based power capping for both single and multiple containers as it\ndoes not degrade the performance of all containers running on the server. The\nresults confirm the feasibility of WattsApp.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 May 2020 19:44:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-02"}

The trials have small sample sizes, so estimates of treatment effects\nare imprecise. Seeing imprecision, clinicians reading research articles may\nfind it difficult to decide when to treat patients with experimental drugs.\nWhatever decision criterion one uses, there is always some probability that\nrandom variation in trial outcomes will lead to prescribing sub-optimal\ntreatments. A conventional practice when comparing standard care and an\ninnovation is to choose the innovation only if the estimated treatment effect\nis positive and statistically significant. This practice defers to standard\ncare as the status quo. To evaluate decision criteria, we use the concept of\nnear-optimality, which jointly considers the probability and magnitude of\ndecision errors. An appealing decision criterion from this perspective is the\nempirical success rule, which chooses the treatment with the highest observed\naverage patient outcome in the trial. Considering the design of recent and\nongoing COVID-19 trials, we show that the empirical success rule yields\ntreatment results that are much closer to optimal than those generated by\nprevailing decision criteria based on hypothesis tests.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 May 2020 19:45:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-02"}

It is shown that in presence of both\nsuperconducting layers and of superconducting proximity at both\nsuperconductor/ferromagnet interfaces a massive shift of the ferromagnetic\nresonance to higher frequencies emerges. The phenomenon is robust and\nessentially long-range: it has been observed for a set of samples with the\nthickness of ferromagnetic layer in the range from tens up to hundreds of\nnanometers. The resonance frequency shift is characterized by proximity-induced\nmagnetic anisotropies: by the positive in-plane uniaxial anisotropy and by the\ndrop of magnetization. The shift and the corresponding uniaxial anisotropy grow\nwith the thickness of the ferromagnetic layer. For instance, the anisotropy\nreaches 0.27~T in experiment for a sample with 350~nm thick ferromagnetic\nlayer, and about 0.4~T in predictions, which makes it a ferromagnetic film\nstructure with the highest anisotropy and the highest natural resonance\nfrequency ever reported.

Open Educational\nResources (OERs) have high potential to contribute to the mitigation of these\nproblems, as they are available in a wide range of learning and occupational\ncontexts globally.

The Milnor-Wood inequality is for circle\nbundles over surfaces, whereas the Mather-Thurston Theorem is about cobording\ngeneral manifold bundles to ones admitting a flat connection. The surprise\ncomes from the close encounter with obstructions from Chern-Weyl theory and\nother smooth obstructions such as the Bott classes and the Godbillion-Vey\ninvariant. Contradiction is avoided because the structure groups for the\npositive results are larger than required for the obstructions, e.g.\\\n$\\operatorname{PSL}(2,\\R)$ versus $\\operatorname{U}(1)$ in the former case and\n$C^1$ versus $C^2$ in the latter.

The\nphilosophy is that living in the IR we cannot expect to know, for a given\nbundle, if it has curvature or is flat, because we can't resolve the fine scale\ntopology which may be present in the base, introduced by a ssc, nor minute\nsymmetry violating distortions of the fiber.

The goal is to assign a sequence of jobs to $m$ identical\nparallel machines so as to minimize the maximum completion time of any job.\nAlready in the 1960s, Graham showed that Greedy is $(2-1/m)$-competitive. The\nbest deterministic online algorithm currently known achieves a competitive\nratio of 1.9201. No deterministic online strategy can obtain a competitiveness\nsmaller than 1.88.\n  In this paper, we study online makespan minimization in the popular\nrandom-order model, where the jobs of a given input arrive as a random\npermutation. It is known that Greedy does not attain a competitive factor\nasymptotically smaller than 2 in this setting. We present the first improved\nperformance guarantees. Specifically, we develop a deterministic online\nalgorithm that achieves a competitive ratio of 1.8478. The result relies on a\nnew analysis approach.

We complement the results by lower\nbounds, for the random-order model. We show that no deterministic online\nalgorithm can achieve a competitive ratio smaller than 4/3.

There exist four kinds of domain biases in Transductive ZSL, i.e.,\nvisual bias and semantic bias between two domains and two visual-semantic\nbiases in respective seen and unseen domains, but existing work only focuses on\nthe part of them, which leads to severe semantic ambiguity during the knowledge\ntransfer. To solve the above problem, we propose a novel Attribute-Induced Bias\nEliminating (AIBE) module for Transductive ZSL. Specifically, for the visual\nbias between two domains, the Mean-Teacher module is first leveraged to bridge\nthe visual representation discrepancy between two domains with unsupervised\nlearning and unlabelled images. Then, an attentional graph attribute embedding\nis proposed to reduce the semantic bias between seen and unseen categories,\nwhich utilizes the graph operation to capture the semantic relationship between\ncategories. Besides, to reduce the semantic-visual bias in the seen domain, we\nalign the visual center of each category, instead of the individual visual data\npoint, with the corresponding semantic attributes, which further preserves the\nsemantic relationship in the embedding space. Finally, for the semantic-visual\nbias in the unseen domain, an unseen semantic alignment constraint is designed\nto align visual and semantic space in an unsupervised manner.

The concepts of free\nenergy and entropy have been utilized to improve conceptual understanding of\nemittance dynamics.

We propose a principled approach to incorporating bulk\neigenvalues in the estimation of $K$. Our method imposes a working model on the\nresidual covariance matrix, which is assumed to be a diagonal matrix whose\nentries are drawn from a gamma distribution.

This motivates us to propose a two-step method: the first step\nuses bulk eigenvalues to estimate parameters of this distribution, and the\nsecond step leverages these parameters to assist the estimation of $K$. The\nresulting estimator $\\hat{K}$ aggregates information in a large number of bulk\neigenvalues. We show the consistency of $\\hat{K}$ under a standard spiked\ncovariance model.

The genes commonly associated with INH\nresistance, katG, inhA, fabG1, and the intergenic region oxyR-ahpC were\nconsidered in this review. In total, 52 articles were included describing 5,632\nINHR clinical isolates from 31 countries.

The performance of existing PINN approaches, however,\nmay degrade in the presence of sharp gradients, as a result of the inability of\nthe network to capture the solution behavior globally. We posit that this\nshortcoming may be remedied by introducing long-range (nonlocal) interactions\ninto the network's input, in addition to the short-range (local) space and time\nvariables. Following this ansatz, here we develop a nonlocal PINN approach\nusing the Peridynamic Differential Operator (PDDO)---a numerical method which\nincorporates long-range interactions and removes spatial derivatives in the\ngoverning equations. Because the PDDO functions can be readily incorporated in\nthe neural network architecture, the nonlocality does not degrade the\nperformance of modern deep-learning algorithms. We apply nonlocal PDDO-PINN to\nthe solution and identification of material parameters in solid mechanics and,\nspecifically, to elastoplastic deformation in a domain subjected to indentation\nby a rigid punch, for which the mixed displacement--traction boundary condition\nleads to localized deformation and sharp gradients in the solution. We document\nthe superior behavior of nonlocal PINN with respect to local PINN in both\nsolution accuracy and parameter inference, illustrating its potential for\nsimulation and discovery of partial differential equations whose solution\ndevelops sharp gradients.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 May 2020 06:26:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-04"}

Recent theoretical studies have highlighted the importance of\napertures for the elastic response and the folding of the grain. Experimental\nobservations show that different pollen grains sharing the same number and type\nof apertures can nonetheless fold in quite diverse fashion. Using thin-shell\ntheory of elasticity, we show how both the absolute elastic properties of the\npollen wall as well as the relative elastic differences between the exine wall\nand the apertures play an important role in determining pollen folding upon\ndesiccation. Focusing primarily on colpate pollen, we delineate the regions of\npollen elastic parameters where desiccation leads to a regular, complete\nclosing of all apertures and thus to an infolding which protects the grain\nagainst water loss. Phase diagrams of pollen folding pathways indicate that an\nincrease in the number of apertures leads to a reduction of the region of\nelastic parameters where the apertures close in a regular fashion. The\ninfolding also depends on the details of the aperture shape and size, and our\nstudy explains how the features of the mechanical design of apertures influence\nthe pollen folding patterns. Understanding the mechanical principles behind\npollen folding pathways should also prove useful for the design of the elastic\nresponse of artificial inhomogeneous shells.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 May 2020 07:45:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 10 Oct 2020 21:22:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-29"}

In addition, we show that, under MLRP, the problem of\nmaximizing Nash social welfare admits a fully polynomial-time approximation\nscheme (FPTAS).\n  Many distribution families bear MLRP. In particular, this property holds if\nall the value densities belong to any one of the following families: Gaussian\n(with the same variance), linear, binomial, Poisson, and exponential\ndistributions. Furthermore, it is known that linear translations of any\nlog-concave function satisfy MLRP. Therefore, our results also hold when the\nvalue densities of the agents are linear translations of the following\n(log-concave) distributions: Laplace, gamma, beta, Subbotin, chi-square,\nDirichlet, and logistic. Hence, through MLRP, the current work obtains novel\ncake-cutting algorithms for multiple distribution families.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 May 2020 10:04:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Sep 2020 17:40:28 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 12 May 2021 13:12:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-13"}

One solution is homomorphic encryption (HE).\nApplying HE to the client-cloud model allows cloud services to perform\ninference directly on the client's encrypted data. While HE can meet privacy\nconstraints, it introduces enormous computational challenges and remains\nimpractically slow in current systems.\n  This paper introduces Cheetah, a set of algorithmic and hardware\noptimizations for HE DNN inference to achieve plaintext DNN inference speeds.\nCheetah proposes HE-parameter tuning optimization and operator scheduling\noptimizations, which together deliver 79x speedup over the state-of-the-art.\nHowever, this still falls short of plaintext inference speeds by almost four\norders of magnitude.

Firstly, when $k = 1$, the tightest\nupper bound on the probability of the union of $n$ pairwise independent events\nis provided in closed-form for any input marginal probability vector\n$\\mathbf{p} \\in [0,1]^n$. To prove the result, we show the existence of a\npositively correlated Bernoulli random vector with transformed bivariate\nprobabilities, which is of independent interest. Building on this, we show that\nthe ratio of the Boole union bound and the tight pairwise independent bound is\nupper bounded by $4/3$ and that the ratio is attained. Applications of the\nresult in correlation gap analysis and distributionally robust bottleneck\noptimization are discussed. The result is extended to find the tightest lower\nbound on the probability of the intersection of $n$ pairwise independent\nevents. Secondly, for any $k \\geq 2$ and input marginal probability vector\n$\\mathbf{p} \\in [0,1]^n$, new upper bounds are derived by exploiting ordering\nof probabilities. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate when the bounds\nprovide improvement over existing bounds.

Since DFS is a trace of the posterior error covariance\nmapped onto the normalized observation space, underestimated DFS implies\noverconfidence (underdispersion) in the analysis spread, which, in a cycled\ncontext, requires covariance inflation to be applied. The theory is then\nextended to cases where covariance localization schemes (either B-localization\nor R-localization) are applied to show how they alleviate the DFS\nunderestimation issue.

Different theories provide different\ncutoff values. We developed an alternative method to derive the cutoff\nfrequency in several standard solar models, including various quiet-Sun and\numbral atmospheres. We performed numerical simulations of wave propagation in\nthe solar atmosphere. The cutoff frequency is determined from the inspection of\nphase difference spectra computed between the velocity signal at two\natmospheric heights. The process is performed by choosing pairs of heights\nacross all the layers between the photosphere and the chromosphere, to derive\nthe vertical stratification of the cutoff in the solar models. The cutoff\nfrequency predicted by the theoretical calculations departs significantly from\nour measurements. In quiet-Sun atmospheres, the cutoff shows a strong\ndependence on the magnetic field for adiabatic wave propagation. When radiative\nlosses are taken into account, the cutoff frequency is greatly reduced and the\nvariation of the cutoff with the strength of the magnetic field is lower. The\neffect of the radiative losses in the cutoff is necessary to understand recent\nquiet-Sun and sunspot observations. In the presence of inclined magnetic\nfields, our numerical calculations confirm the reduction of the cutoff\nfrequency due to the reduced gravity experienced by waves propagating along\nfield lines. An additional reduction is also found in regions with significant\nchanges in the temperature, due to the lower temperature gradient along the\npath of field-guided waves. Our results show that the cutoff values are not\ncorrectly captured by theoretical estimates. In addition, most of the\nwidely-used analytical cutoff formulae neglect the impact of magnetic fields\nand radiative losses, whose role is critical to determine the evanescent or\npropagating nature of the waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 May 2020 14:02:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-29"}

Rep. 9, 14169]: after a slow cyclic\nsweep of a control parameter, the probability that a microcanonical ensemble\nreturns to the neighborhood of its initial energy is significantly below one. A\nsimilar phenomenon has recently been confirmed in a corresponding quantum\nsystem for not too small particle number $N$. Quantum-classical correspondence\nhas been found to be non-trivial in this case, however; the rate at which the\ncontrol parameter changes must not be extremely slow and the initial\ndistribution of energies must not be too narrow. In this paper we directly\ncompare the quantum and classical forms of probabilistic hysteresis by making\nuse of the Husimi quantum phase space formalism. In particular we demonstrate\nthat the classical ergodization mechanism, which is a key ingredient in\nclassical probabilistic hysteresis, can lead to a breakdown of\nquantum-classical correspondence rather than to quantum ergodization. As a\nresult strong quantum effects in the long-term evolution are present, even\nthough the quantum corrections in the equations of motion are proportional to\n$1/N$ and therefore would naively seem to be small. We also show, however, that\nquantum ergodization is restored by averaging over energies, so that for\nsufficient initial energy width and not-too-slow sweep rate the classical\nresults are recovered after all. Finally we show that the formal\nincommutability of the classical and adiabatic limits in our system, leading to\nthe breakdown of quantum-classical correspondence in the quasi-static limit, is\ndue to macroscopic quantum tunneling through a large energetic barrier. This\nexplains the extremely slow sweep rates needed to reach the quantum adiabatic\nlimit that were reported in our previous work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 May 2020 15:40:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Oct 2020 07:06:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 5 Nov 2020 07:25:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-18"}

Regularity means that each item is compared to others for the\nsame number of times, resulting in a kind of symmetry. A graph on an odd number\nof vertices is called quasi-regular, if the degree of every vertex is the same\nodd number, except for one vertex whose degree is larger by one.

If the diameter of the graph of\ncomparisons is low as possible (among the graphs of the same number of edges),\nwe can avoid, or, at least decrease, such cumulated errors.

We prove our main result both\nabstractly and concretely, for both discrete and continuous states, taking care\nto illustrate the common structures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 31 May 2020 11:55:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2020 14:05:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-29"}

Prior\nresearch has mostly focused on improving the accuracy and efficiency of\nclassifiers, with interpretability being somewhat neglected. This aspect of\nclassifiers has become critical for many application domains and the\nintroduction of the EU GDPR legislation in 2018 is likely to further emphasize\nthe importance of interpretable learning algorithms. Currently,\nstate-of-the-art classification accuracy is achieved with very complex models\nbased on large ensembles (COTE) or deep neural networks (FCN). These approaches\nare not efficient with regard to either time or space, are difficult to\ninterpret and cannot be applied to variable-length time series, requiring\npre-processing of the original series to a set fixed-length. In this paper we\npropose new time series classification algorithms to address these gaps. Our\napproach is based on symbolic representations of time series, efficient\nsequence mining algorithms and linear classification models. Our linear models\nare as accurate as deep learning models but are more efficient regarding\nrunning time and memory, can work with variable-length time series and can be\ninterpreted by highlighting the discriminative symbolic features on the\noriginal time series. We show that our multi-resolution multi-domain linear\nclassifier (mtSS-SEQL+LR) achieves a similar accuracy to the state-of-the-art\nCOTE ensemble, and to recent deep learning methods (FCN, ResNet), but uses a\nfraction of the time and memory required by either COTE or deep models.
