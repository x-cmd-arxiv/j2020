These zeros\ncorrespond to the eigenvalues of the Laplacian on the associated hyperbolic\nsurfaces $X_w^n = \\Gamma_w^n \\backslash \\mathbb{H}^2$. We show that the\nclassical Selberg zeta function $Z_{\\Gamma_w}(s)$ can be approximated by\ndeterminants of finite matrices whose entries are explicitly given in terms of\nthe Riemann zeta function. Moreover, we prove an asymptotic expansion for the\nHausdorff dimension $\\delta(w)$ as $w\\to \\infty$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 May 2020 17:53:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-26"}

Also, flares are transient and localized events observed to occur\nat all longitudes. With these considerations, we have carried out\nmulti-wavelength analysis of two representative flare events.

In this proof-of-concept study, we propose a novel generative\nadversarial network integrated with perceptual supervision to derive\ninstantaneous volumetric images from a single 2D projection. Our proposed\nnetwork, named TransNet, consists of three modules, i.e., encoding,\ntransformation and decoding modules. Rather than only using image distance loss\nbetween the generated 3D images and the ground truth 3D CT images to supervise\nthe network, perceptual loss in feature space is integrated into loss function\nto force the TransNet to yield accurate lung boundary. Adversarial supervision\nis also used to improve the realism of generated 3D images. We conducted a\nsimulation study on 20 patient cases, who had received lung SBRT treatments in\nour institution and undergone 4D-CT simulation, and evaluated the efficacy and\nconsistency of our method for four different projection angles, i.e., 0, 30, 60\nand 90 degree. For each 3D CT image set of a breathing phase, we simulated its\n2D projections at these angles.Then for each projection angle, a patient's 3D\nCT images of 9 phases and the corresponding 2D projection data were used for\ntraining, with the remaining phase used for testing.

We relate the $(-c/2)$-th power of the determinant of the\nLaplacian to the appropriately regularized partition function of a Brownian\nloop soup of intensity $c$ on the surface. This means that, in a certain sense,\ndecorating a random surface by a Brownian loop soup of intensity $c$\ncorresponds to weighting the law of the surface by the $(-c/2)$-th power of the\ndeterminant of the Laplacian.\n  Next, we introduce a method of regularizing a Liouville quantum gravity (LQG)\nsurface (with some matter central charge parameter $\\mathbf{c}$) to produce a\nsmooth surface.

Several subsequent decades of exponential growth\nin computational power have brought us to the present day, where models ever\ngrow in resolution and complexity, capable of mastery of many small-scale\nphenomena with global repercussions, and ever more intricate feedbacks in the\nEarth system.\n  The current juncture in computing, seven decades later, heralds an end to\nwhat is called Dennard scaling, the physics behind ever smaller computational\nunits and ever faster arithmetic. This is prompting a fundamental change in our\napproach to the simulation of weather and climate, potentially as revolutionary\nas that wrought by John von Neumann in the 1950s. One approach could return us\nto an earlier era of pattern recognition and extrapolation, this time aided by\ncomputational power. Another approach could lead us to insights that continue\nto be expressed in mathematical equations. In either approach, or any synthesis\nof those, it is clearly no longer the steady march of the last few decades,\ncontinuing to add detail to ever more elaborate models. In this prospectus, we\nattempt to show the outlines of how this may unfold in the coming decades, a\nnew harnessing of physical knowledge, computation, and data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 May 2020 23:46:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2020 16:19:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-14"}

In this case, weights and therefore\npre-activations can be modeled with a heavy-tailed distribution that has an\ninfinite variance but has a finite (non-integer) fractional moment of order $s$\nwith $s<2$. Motivated by this fact, we develop initialization schemes for fully\nconnected feed-forward networks that can provably preserve any given moment of\norder $s \\in (0, 2]$ over the layers for a class of activations including ReLU,\nLeaky ReLU, Randomized Leaky ReLU, and linear activations. These generalized\nschemes recover traditional initialization schemes in the limit $s \\to 2$ and\nserve as part of a principled theory for initialization. For all these schemes,\nwe show that the network output admits a finite almost sure limit as the number\nof layers grows, and the limit is heavy-tailed in some settings. This sheds\nfurther light into the origins of heavy tail during signal propagation in DNNs.\nWe prove that the logarithm of the norm of the network outputs, if properly\nscaled, will converge to a Gaussian distribution with an explicit mean and\nvariance we can compute depending on the activation used, the value of s chosen\nand the network width.

These striking systems provide key\nsnapshots for dissecting galactic disks and are studied extensively in the\nlocal Universe. However, not much is known about distant (z>0.1) collisional\nrings. Here we present a detailed study of a ring galaxy at a look-back time of\n10.8 Gyr (z=2.19). Compared with our Milky Way, this galaxy has a similar\nstellar mass, but has a stellar half-light radius that is 1.5-2.2 times larger\nand is forming stars 50 times faster. The large, diffuse stellar light outside\nthe star-forming ring, combined with a radial velocity on the ring and an\nintruder galaxy nearby, provides evidence for this galaxy hosting a collisional\nring. If the ring is secularly evolved, the implied large bar in a giant disk\nwould be inconsistent with the current understanding of the earliest formation\nof barred spirals. Contrary to previous predictions, this work suggests that\nmassive collisional rings were as rare 11 Gyr ago as they are today. Our\ndiscovery offers a unique pathway for studying density waves in young galaxies,\nas well as constraining the cosmic evolution of spiral disks and galaxy groups.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 May 2020 01:17:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-26"}

As the $\\rm{eV}$ sterile states naturally become\nnon-relativistic before the Matter Radiation Equality (MRE), we show that the\nneutrino-scalar fluid develops strong perturbative instability followed by the\nformation of neutrino-nuggets and the early dark energy behaviour disappears\naround MRE. The stability of the nugget is achieved when the Fermi pressure\nbalances the attractive scalar force and we numerically find the mass and\nradius of heavy cold nuggets by solving for the static configuration for the\nscalar field. We find that for the case when DM nugget density is sub-dominant\nand most of the early DE energy goes into scalar field dynamics, it can in\nprinciple relax the Hubble anomaly. Especially when a kinetic energy dominated\nphase appears after the phase transition, the DE density dilutes faster than\nradiation and satisfy the requirements for solving $H_0$ anomaly. In our\nscenario, unlike in originally proposed early dark energy theory, the dark\nenergy density is controlled by ($\\rm{eV}$) neutrino mass and it does not\nrequire a fine tuned EDE scale. We perform a MCMC analysis and confront our\nmodel with Planck + SHOES and BAO data and find an evidence for non-zero\nneutrino-scalar EDE density during MRE.

This paper contains the following contributions. First, we\nestablish the closed-form expression of the minimum update bandwidth attainable\nby irregular array codes. Second, after defining a class of irregular array\ncodes, called Minimum Update Bandwidth~(MUB) codes, which achieve the minimum\nupdate bandwidth of irregular array codes, we determine the smallest code\nredundancy attainable by MUB codes. Third, the code parameters, with which the\nminimum code redundancy of irregular array codes and the smallest code\nredundancy of MUB codes can be equal, are identified, which allows us to define\nMR-MUB codes as a class of irregular array codes that simultaneously achieve\nthe minimum code redundancy and the minimum update bandwidth. Fourth, we\nintroduce explicit code constructions of MR-MUB codes and MUB codes with the\nsmallest code redundancy. Fifth, we establish a lower bound of the update\ncomplexity of MR-MUB codes, which can be used to prove that the minimum update\ncomplexity of irregular array codes may not be achieved by MR-MUB codes.

Attackers may avoid\ndetection by changing URLs or domains, bundling unwanted code with benign code,\nor inlining code in pages. The common flaw in existing approaches is that they\nevaluate code based on its delivery mechanism, not its behavior. In this work\nwe address this problem with a system for generating signatures of the\nprivacy-and-security relevant behavior of executed JavaScript. Our system\nconsiders script behavior during each turn on the JavaScript event loop.\nFocusing on event loop turns allows us to build signatures that are robust\nagainst code obfuscation, code bundling, URL modification, and other common\nevasions, as well as handle unique aspects of web applications.

A seminal step in\nleveraging these rich datasets for downstream inference is understanding the\ncharacteristics of the data which are repeatable -- the aspects of the data\nthat are able to be identified under a duplicated analysis. Conflictingly, the\nutility of traditional repeatability measures, such as the intraclass\ncorrelation coefficient, under these settings is limited. In recent work, novel\ndata repeatability measures have been introduced in the context where a set of\nsubjects are measured twice or more, including: fingerprinting, rank sums, and\ngeneralizations of the intraclass correlation coefficient. However, the\nrelationships between, and the best practices among these measures remains\nlargely unknown. In this manuscript, we formalize a novel repeatability\nmeasure, discriminability.

The high-order correlation of given multiple views is modeled by\ncovariance tensor, which is different from most CCA formulations relying solely\non the pairwise correlations. Parameters of transformations of each view are\njointly learned by maximizing the high-order canonical correlation. To solve\nthe resulting problem, we reformulate it as the best sum of rank-1\napproximation, which can be efficiently solved by existing tensor decomposition\nmethod. DTCCA is a nonlinear extension of tensor CCA (TCCA) via deep networks.\nThe transformations of DTCCA are parametric functions, which are very different\nfrom implicit mapping in the form of kernel function. Comparing with kernel\nTCCA, DTCCA not only can deal with arbitrary dimensions of the input data, but\nalso does not need to maintain the training data for computing representations\nof any given data point. Hence, DTCCA as a unified model can efficiently\novercome the scalable issue of TCCA for either high-dimensional multi-view data\nor a large amount of views, and it also naturally extends TCCA for learning\nnonlinear representation. Extensive experiments on three multi-view data sets\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 May 2020 04:04:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-26"}

It is\nused in many different areas to describe the properties of a physical system\nwhich has been isolated from its environment. The interaction with the\n`outside' is then usually reduced to a scattering process, in which incoming\nradiation interacts with the system, which in turn emits outgoing radiation. In\nEinstein's theory of gravitation isolated systems are modeled as asymptotically\nflat space-times. They provide the appropriate paradigm for the study of\ngravitational waves and their interaction with a material system or even only\nwith themselves. In view of the emerging era of gravitational wave astronomy,\nin which gravitational wave signals from many different astrophysical sources\nare detected and interpreted, it is necessary to have a foundation for the\ntheoretical and numerical treatments of these signals. Furthermore, from a\npurely mathematical point of view, it is important to have a full understanding\nof the implications of imposing the condition of asymptotic flatness onto\nsolutions of the Einstein equations. While it is known that there exists a\nlarge class of asymptotically flat solutions of Einstein's equations, it is not\nknown what the necessary and sufficient conditions at infinity are that have to\nbe imposed on initial data so that they evolve into regular asymptotically flat\nspace-times. The crux lies in the region near space-like infinity $i^0$ where\nincoming and outgoing radiation `meet'.

However, accurate detection and diagnosis of\nnon-categorial or distortion errors (viz. approximating L2 phones with L1\n(first-language) phones, or erroneous pronunciations in between) still seems\nout of reach. In view of this, we propose to conduct MDD with a novel end-\nto-end automatic speech recognition (E2E-based ASR) approach. In particular, we\nexpand the original L2 phone set with their corresponding anti-phone set,\nmaking the E2E-based MDD approach have a better capability to take in both\ncategorical and non-categorial mispronunciations, aiming to provide better\nmispronunciation detection and diagnosis feedback. Furthermore, a novel\ntransfer-learning paradigm is devised to obtain the initial model estimate of\nthe E2E-based MDD system without resource to any phonological rules. Extensive\nsets of experimental results on the L2-ARCTIC dataset show that our best system\ncan outperform the existing E2E baseline system and pronunciation scoring based\nmethod (GOP) in terms of the F1-score, by 11.05% and 27.71%, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 May 2020 07:27:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Aug 2020 07:41:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-31"}

Here, by\nexamining swimming Euglena gracilis in environments of controlled crowding and\ngeometry, we show that this behaviour is triggered by confinement. Under these\nconditions, it allows cells to switch from unviable flagellar swimming to a new\nand highly robust mode of fast crawling, which can deal with extreme geometric\nconfinement and turn both frictional and hydraulic resistance into propulsive\nforces. To understand how a single cell can control such an adaptable and\nrobust mode of locomotion, we developed a computational model of the motile\napparatus of Euglena cells consisting of an active striated cell envelope. Our\nmodelling shows that gait adaptability does not require specific\nmechanosensitive feedback but instead can be explained by the mechanical\nself-regulation of an elastic and extended motor system. Our study thus\nidentifies a locomotory function and the operating principles of the adaptable\nperistaltic body deformation of Euglena cells.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 May 2020 07:32:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-26"}

The\ntwo confining backgrounds with D-instantons are obtained from the black\nD(-1)-D3 and D0-D4 solution with a double Wick rotation. The total potential\nand pair production/decay rate in the Schwinger effect are calculated\nnumerically by examining the NG action of a fundamental string and the DBI\naction of a single flavor brane all in the presence of an electric field. In\nboth backgrounds our numerical calculation agrees with the critical electric\nfield evaluated from the DBI action and shows the potential barrier is\nincreased by the presence of the D-instantons, thus the production/decay rate\nis suppressed by the D-instantons.

Under certain conditions these fluctuations can be described as a\ndiffusion process in the reference frame moving with the average velocity of\nthe front. Here we address pushed fronts, where the front velocity in the\ndeterministic limit is affected by higher-order reactions and is therefore\nlarger than the linear spread velocity. For a subclass of these fronts --\nstrongly pushed fronts -- the effective diffusion constant $D_f\\sim 1/N$ of the\nfront can be calculated, in the leading order, via a perturbation theory in\n$1/N \\ll 1$, where $N\\gg 1$ is the typical number of particles in the\ntransition region. This perturbation theory, however, overestimates the\ncontribution of a few fast particles in the leading edge of the front. We\nsuggest a more consistent calculation by introducing a spatial integration\ncutoff at a distance beyond which the average number of particles is of order\n1. This leads to a non-perturbative correction to $D_f$ which even becomes\ndominant close to the transition point between the strongly and weakly pushed\nfronts. At the transition point we obtain a logarithmic correction to the $1/N$\nscaling of $D_f$. We also uncover another, and quite surprising, effect of the\nfast particles in the leading edge of the front. Because of these particles,\nthe position fluctuations of the front can be described as a diffusion process\nonly on very long time intervals with a duration $\\Delta t \\gg \\tau_N$, where\n$\\tau_N$ scales as $N$. At intermediate times the position fluctuations of the\nfront are anomalously large and non-diffusive.

Stellar irradiation heating is included with\nopacities for 0.1- to 10-$\\mu$m-sized dust. Saturated VSI turbulence produces a\nstress-to-pressure ratio of $\\alpha \\simeq 10^{-4}$. The value of $\\alpha$ is\nlowest within 30~au of the star, where thermal relaxation is slower relative to\nthe orbital period and approaches the rate below which VSI is cut off. The rise\nin $\\alpha$ from 20 to 30~au causes a dip in the surface density near 35~au,\nleading to Rossby wave instability and the generation of a stationary,\nlong-lived vortex spanning about 4~au in radius and 40~au in azimuth.

Here we introduce the\nContinuous Maxwell Demon (CMD), a device capable of extracting arbitrarily\nlarge amounts of work per cycle by repeated measurements of the state of a\nsystem, and experimentally test it in single DNA hairpin pulling experiments.\nIn the CMD the demon monitors the state of the DNA hairpin (folded or unfolded)\nby observing it at equally spaced time intervals but extracts work only when\nthe molecule changes state. We demonstrate that the average maximum work per\ncycle that can be extracted by the CMD is limited by the information-content of\nthe stored sequences, in agreement with the second law. Work extraction\nefficiency is found to be maximal in the large information-content limit where\nwork extraction is fuelled by rare events.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 May 2020 09:02:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-03"}

Existing methods either explore independent meta-paths\nfor user-item pairs over KG, or employ graph neural network (GNN) on whole KG\nto produce representations for users and items separately. Despite\neffectiveness, the former type of methods fails to fully capture structural\ninformation implied in KG, while the latter ignores the mutual effect between\ntarget user and item during the embedding propagation. In this work, we propose\na new framework named Adaptive Target-Behavior Relational Graph network (ATBRG\nfor short) to effectively capture structural relations of target user-item\npairs over KG. Specifically, to associate the given target item with user\nbehaviors over KG, we propose the graph connect and graph prune techniques to\nconstruct adaptive target-behavior relational graph. To fully distill\nstructural information from the sub-graph connected by rich relations in an\nend-to-end fashion, we elaborate on the model design of ATBRG, equipped with\nrelation-aware extractor layer and representation activation layer. We perform\nextensive experiments on both industrial and benchmark datasets. Empirical\nresults show that ATBRG consistently and significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art methods. Moreover, ATBRG has also achieved a performance\nimprovement of 5.1% on CTR metric after successful deployment in one popular\nrecommendation scenario of Taobao APP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 May 2020 09:34:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 May 2020 03:13:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 27 May 2020 11:21:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-28"}

Properties of the deeper crustal layers\ncan be probed at later times after the end of the outburst.

This research comprehensively analyzes\ndifferent hardware-based malware detectors by comparing different machine\nlearning algorithms' accuracy with binary and multi-class classification\nmodels. Our experimental results indicate that when compared to complex machine\nlearning models (e. g. Neural Network and Logistic), light-weight J48 and JRip\nalgorithms perform better in detecting the malicious patterns even with the\nintroduction of multiple types of malware. Although their detection accuracy\nslightly lowers, their robustness (Area Under the Curve) is still high enough\nthat they deliver a reasonable false positive rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 May 2020 10:45:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-26"}

The attribute information describes\nusers'(items') characteristics and has a wide range of applications, such as\nuser profiling, item annotation, and feature-enhanced recommendation. As\nannotating user (item) attributes is a labor intensive task, the attribute\nvalues are often incomplete with many missing attribute values. Therefore, item\nrecommendation and attribute inference have become two main tasks in these\nplatforms. Researchers have long converged that user (item) attributes and the\npreference behavior are highly correlated. Some researchers proposed to\nleverage one kind of data for the remaining task, and showed to improve\nperformance. Nevertheless, these models either neglected the incompleteness of\nuser (item) attributes or regarded the correlation of the two tasks with simple\nmodels, leading to suboptimal performance of these two tasks. To this end, in\nthis paper, we define these two tasks in an attributed user-item bipartite\ngraph, and propose an Adaptive Graph Convolutional Network (AGCN) approach for\njoint item recommendation and attribute inference. The key idea of AGCN is to\niteratively perform two parts: 1) Learning graph embedding parameters with\npreviously learned approximated attribute values to facilitate two tasks; 2)\nSending the approximated updated attribute values back to the attributed graph\nfor better graph embedding learning. Therefore, AGCN could adaptively adjust\nthe graph embedding learning parameters by incorporating both the given\nattributes and the estimated attribute values, in order to provide weakly\nsupervised information to refine the two tasks. Extensive experimental results\non three real-world datasets clearly show the effectiveness of the proposed\nmodel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 May 2020 10:50:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-26"}

Therefore, we propose a novel Joint Pixel\nand Feature Alignment (JPFA) framework for such cross-dataset palmprint\nrecognition scenarios. Two stage-alignment is applied to obtain adaptive\nfeatures in source and target datasets. 1) Deep style transfer model is adopted\nto convert source images into fake images to reduce the dataset gaps and\nperform data augmentation on pixel level. 2) A new deep domain adaptation model\nis proposed to extract adaptive features by aligning the dataset-specific\ndistributions of target-source and target-fake pairs on feature level.

The harmonic theory predicts a\nquadratic dispersion for the flexural acoustic vibrational mode, which leads\nthe unphysical result that long wavelength in-plane acoustic modes decay before\nvibrating one period, preventing the propagation of sound. The robustness of\nthe quadratic dispersion has been questioned by arguing that the anharmonic\nphonon-phonon interaction linearizes it. However, this implies a divergent\nbending rigidity in the long wavelength limit not reproduced experimentally.\nHere we show that rotational symmetry protects the quadratic flexural\ndispersion against phonon-phonon interactions and that, consequently, the\nbending stiffness is non-divergent irrespective of the temperature. Our\nnon-perturbative anharmonic calculations also determine that sound propagation\ncoexists with a quadratic dispersion. We also show that the temperature\ndependence of the height fluctuations of the membrane, known as ripples, is\nfully determined by thermal or quantum fluctuations, but without the anharmonic\nsuppression of their amplitude previously assumed.

This provides the\npossibility i) to learn the normative range of structural and functional brain\nmeasures on large multi-site data; ii) to recalibrate and reuse the learned\nmodel on local small data; therefore, HBR closes the technical loop for\napplying normative modeling as a medical tool for the diagnosis and prognosis\nof mental disorders.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 May 2020 11:55:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-26"}

The manipulator dynamically converges to the best-suited target among\nmultiple identical instances from any random initial pose within the workspace.\nThe system trained with only simulated data is able to achieve 90.3% grasp\nsuccess rate in the real-world experiments with up to 85Hz closed-loop control\non one GTX 1080Ti GPU and significantly outperforms a Pose-Based-Visual-Servo\n(PBVS) grasping system adapted from a state-of-the-art single shot RGB 6D pose\nestimation algorithm. A key contribution of the paper is the inclusion of a\nfirst-order differential constraint associated with the cLf as a regularisation\nterm during learning, and we provide evidence that this leads to more robust\nand reliable reaching/grasping performance than vanilla regression on general\ncontrol inputs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 May 2020 12:26:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 May 2020 01:32:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-29"}

Therefore,\ndetecting when MW occurs can prevent us from those negative outcomes resulting\nfrom MW, such as failing to keep track of course during learning. In this work,\nwe first collect a multi-modal Sustained Attention to Response Task (MM-SART)\ndatabase for detecting MW. Eighty-two participants' data are collected in our\nexperiments.

Then, we propose an effective MW\ndetection system based on the collected EEG signals. To explore the non-linear\ncharacteristics of EEG signals, we utilize the entropy-based features in time,\nfrequency, and wavelet domains. The experimental results show that we can reach\n0.712 AUC score by using the random forest (RF) classifier with the\nleave-one-subject-out cross-validation.

In addition using this model ansatz for CP-asymmetry and\nsolutions of Boltzmann equations, we also show how successful prediction of\nbaryon asymmetry emerges in the cases of both unflavoured and two-flavoured\nleptogeneses. With additional $Z_2$ discrete symmetry, a minimal extension of\nthis model is shown to be capable of predicting a scalar singlet WIMP dark\nmatter in agreement with direct and indirect observations.

We deployed the algorithm on the SCExAO HCI\ninstrument at the Subaru Telescope using the internal near-infrared camera in\nH-band. We tested F&F with the internal source, and it was deployed on-sky to\ntest its performance with the full end-to-end system and atmospheric\nturbulence. The performance of the algorithm was evaluated by two metrics based\non the PSF quality: 1) the Strehl ratio approximation ($SRA$), and 2) variance\nof the normalized first Airy ring ($VAR$). Random LWE phase screens with a\npeak-to-valley wavefront error between 0.4 $\\mu$m and 2 $\\mu$m were all\ncorrected to a $SRA$ $>$90\\% and an $VAR\\lessapprox0.05$.

For stretched exponentially\ndecaying interactions, the limiting value of the persistence is found to remain\ncontinuous, similar to the model with short-range interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 May 2020 13:41:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Aug 2020 12:04:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-19"}

We propose\ndifferent variants of the GM methodology which have been proven to increase the\nunderlying performance of the model.

In this setup, one set of multipoles describes\nthe temperature anisotropies, while two other sets, of electric and magnetic\ntypes, describe the polarization anisotropies. In order to reduce the number of\nmultipoles types needed for polarization, and thus to speed up the numerical\nresolution, an optimal hierarchy has been proposed in the literature for\nEinstein-Boltzmann codes. However, it has been recently shown that the\nseparability between directional and orbital eigenfunctions employed in the\noptimal hierarchy is not correct in the presence of spatial curvature. We\ninvestigate how the assumption of separability affects the optimal hierarchy,\nand show that it introduces relative errors of order $\\Omega_K$ with respect to\nthe full hierarchy. Despite of that, we show that the optimal hierarchy still\ngives extremely good results for temperature and polarization angular spectra,\nwith relative errors that are much smaller than cosmic variance even for\ncurvatures as large as $|\\Omega_K|=0.1$. Still, we find that the polarization\nangular spectra from tensor perturbations are significantly altered when using\nthe optimal hierarchy, leading to errors that are typically of order $50\n|\\Omega_K| \\%$ on that component.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 May 2020 14:00:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}

Existing EA solutions mainly rely on structural\ninformation to align entities, typically through KG embedding. Nonetheless, in\nreal-life KGs, only a few entities are densely connected to others, and the\nrest majority possess rather sparse neighborhood structure. We refer to the\nlatter as long-tail entities, and observe that such phenomenon arguably limits\nthe use of structural information for EA.

Such\ndiagrams reveal several enigmatic polarization effects: 1) bifurcations and\nloops of PA curve under central pulse components, 2) vertical spread of flux at\nall PA values, 3) exchange of power content between PA tracks of two orthogonal\npolarization modes (OPMs), and 4) peripherically-flat PA swings that span more\nthan 180 degrees. It is shown that all these phenomena result from passage of\nobserved polarization state near the pure-V pole of Poincare sphere. Much of\ntheir complexity results from cartographic transformation from Poincare sphere\nto the longitude-PA plane. An odd number of near-pole passage produces apparent\nreplacement of OPMs power in the profile wings, although the same amount of\nflux keeps staying in each modal patch on the Poincare sphere. The fitting of\npulsar PA curves should therefore allow for transitions between the primary\n(strong) and secondary (weak) PA track.

The influence of the interstitial gas on rough hard spheres\nis modeled via a Fokker-Planck generalized equation for rotating spheres\naccounting for the coupling of both the translational and rotational degrees of\nfreedom of grains with the background viscous gas. The generalized\nFokker-Planck term is the sum of two ordinary Fokker-Planck differential\noperators in linear $\\mathbf{v}$ and angular $\\boldsymbol{\\omega}$ velocity\nspace.

Cloud radiative feedback has been proposed as a potential\nmechanism driving the vigorous atmospheric circulation on BDs and directly\nimaged EGPs, and yet it has not been demonstrated in three-dimensional\ndynamical models at relevant conditions. Here we present a series of\natmospheric circulation models that self-consistently coupled dynamics with\nidealized cloud formation and its radiative effects. We demonstrate that\nvigorous atmospheric circulation can be triggered and self-maintained by cloud\nradiative feedback. Typical isobaric temperature variation could reach over 100\nK and horizontally averaged wind speed could be several hundred m/s. The\ncirculation is dominated by cloud-forming and clear-sky vortices that evolve\nover timescales from several to tens of hours. The typical horizontal\nlengthscale of dominant vortices is closed to the Rossby deformation radius,\nshowing a linear dependence on the inverse of rotation rate. Stronger rotation\ntends to weaken the vertical transport of vapor and clouds, leading to overall\nthinner clouds. Domain-mean outgoing radiative flux exhibits variability over\ntimescales of tens of hours due to the statistical evolution of storms.\nDifferent bottom boundary conditions in the models could lead to qualitatively\ndifferent circulation near the observable layer. The circulation driven by\ncloud radiative feedback represents a robust mechanism generating significant\nsurface inhomogeneity as well as irregular flux time variability.

Our strategy is a tailored-made version of the vanishing\nviscosity method for partial differential equations. Here, the viscosity has to\nbe understood as the square intensity of a common noise that is inserted in the\nmean field game or, equivalently, as the diffusivity parameter in the related\nparabolic version of the master equation. As established recently, the randomly\nforced mean field game becomes indeed uniquely solvable for a relevant choice\nof a Wright-Fisher common noise, the counterpart of which in the master\nequation is a Kimura operator on the simplex. We here elaborate on this idea to\nmake the mean field game with common noise both uniquely solvable and\npotential, meaning that its unique solution is in fact equal to the unique\nminimizer of a suitable stochastic mean field control problem. Taking the limit\nas the intensity of the common noise vanishes, we obtain a rigorous proof of\nthe aforementioned selection principle. As a byproduct, we get that the\nclassical solution to the viscous master equation associated with the mean\nfield game with common noise converges to the gradient of the value function of\nthe mean field control problem without common noise; we hence select a\nparticular weak solution of the master equation of the original mean field\ngame.

A unified formulation and\nmulti-order modeling are two critical perspectives for analyzing and\nrepresenting human motion.

Unlike traditional programs, once deployed, they cannot be\nmodified. As smart contracts carry more value, they become more of an exciting\ntarget for attackers. Over the last years, they suffered from exploits costing\nmillions of dollars due to simple programming mistakes. As a result, a variety\nof tools for detecting bugs have been proposed. Most of these tools rely on\nsymbolic execution, which may yield false positives due to over-approximation.\nRecently, many fuzzers have been proposed to detect bugs in smart contracts.\nHowever, these tend to be more effective in finding shallow bugs and less\neffective in finding bugs that lie deep in the execution, therefore achieving\nlow code coverage and many false negatives. An alternative that has proven to\nachieve good results in traditional programs is hybrid fuzzing, a combination\nof symbolic execution and fuzzing. In this work, we study hybrid fuzzing on\nsmart contracts and present ConFuzzius, the first hybrid fuzzer for smart\ncontracts. ConFuzzius uses evolutionary fuzzing to exercise shallow parts of a\nsmart contract and constraint solving to generate inputs that satisfy complex\nconditions that prevent evolutionary fuzzing from exploring deeper parts.\nMoreover, ConFuzzius leverages dynamic data dependency analysis to efficiently\ngenerate sequences of transactions that are more likely to result in contract\nstates in which bugs may be hidden. We evaluate the effectiveness of ConFuzzius\nby comparing it with state-of-the-art symbolic execution tools and fuzzers for\nsmart contracts. Our evaluation on a curated dataset of 128 contracts and 21K\nreal-world contracts shows that our hybrid approach detects more bugs (up to\n23%) while outperforming state-of-the-art in terms of code coverage (up to\n69%), and that data dependency analysis boosts bug detection up to 18%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 May 2020 15:07:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Mar 2021 15:14:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-11"}

We also define the ``strength'' of Fingers-of-God as the\nratio of the parallel and perpendicular size of the contour in the two-point\ncorrelation function set by a specific threshold value and show that the\nstrength parameter helps constraining $(\\Omega_m, b_v^s, \\alpha)$ by breaking\nthe degeneracy among them. The resulting parameter values from all measurements\nare $(\\Omega_m,b_v^s)=(0.272\\pm0.013,0.982\\pm0.040)$, indicating a slight\nreduction of satellite galaxy velocity relative to the MBP. However,\nconsidering that the average MBP speed inside haloes is $0.94$ times the dark\nmatter velocity dispersion, the main drivers behind the galaxy velocity bias\nare gravitational interactions, rather than baryonic effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 May 2020 15:13:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-08"}

Magnetized neutron stars (magnetars) have been considered\nas the sources powering the FRBs, but the connection is controversial because\nof differing energetics and the lack of radio and X-ray detections with similar\ncharacteristics in the two classes. We report here the detection by the AGILE\nsatellite on April 28, 2020 of an X-ray burst in coincidence with the very\nbright radio burst from the Galactic magnetar SGR 1935+2154. The burst detected\nby AGILE in the hard X-ray band (18-60 keV) lasts about 0.5 seconds, it is\nspectrally cutoff above 80 keV, and implies an isotropically emitted energy ~\n$10^{40}$ erg. This event is remarkable in many ways: it shows for the first\ntime that a magnetar can produce X-ray bursts in coincidence with FRB-like\nradio bursts; it also suggests that FRBs associated with magnetars may emit\nX-ray bursts of both magnetospheric and radio-pulse types that may be\ndiscovered in nearby sources. Guided by this detection, we discuss SGR\n1935+2154 in the context of FRBs, and especially focus on the class of\nrepeating-FRBs. Based on energetics, magnetars with fields B ~ $10^{15}$ G may\npower the majority of repeating-FRBs. Nearby repeating-FRBs offer a unique\noccasion to consolidate the FRB-magnetar connection, and we present new data on\nthe X-ray monitoring of nearby FRBs. Our detection enlightens and constrains\nthe physical process leading to FRBs: contrary to previous expectations,\nhigh-brightness temperature radio emission coexists with spectrally-cutoff\nX-ray radiation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 May 2020 15:21:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-26"}

Machine learning based\nrecognition models often perform poorly when applied to new users that were not\npart of the training data. Previous work has addressed this challenge by\npersonalizing general recognition models to the unique motion pattern of a new\nuser in a static batch setting. They require target user data to be available\nupfront. The more challenging online setting has received less attention. No\nsamples from the target user are available in advance, but they arrive\nsequentially. Additionally, the motion pattern of users may change over time.\nThus, adapting to new and forgetting old information must be traded off.\nFinally, the target user should not have to do any work to use the recognition\nsystem by, say, labeling any activities. Our work addresses all of these\nchallenges by proposing an unsupervised online domain adaptation algorithm.\nBoth classification and personalization happen continuously and incrementally\nin real time. Our solution works by aligning the feature distributions of all\nsubjects, be they sources or the target, in hidden neural network layers.

One of the main drawbacks of such approaches is the lack of a\nrigorous frame based on the laws of physics. This may render physically\ninconsistent the predictions of a trained network, which can be even dangerous\nfor real applications.\n  Here we propose a new class of data-driven, physics-based, neural networks\nfor constitutive modeling of strain rate independent processes at the material\npoint level, which we define as Thermodynamics-based Artificial Neural Networks\n(TANNs). The two basic principles of thermodynamics are encoded in the\nnetwork's architecture by taking advantage of automatic differentiation to\ncompute the numerical derivatives of a network with respect to its inputs. In\nthis way, derivatives of the free-energy, the dissipation rate and their\nrelation with the stress and internal state variables are hardwired in the\nnetwork. Consequently, our network does not have to identify the underlying\npattern of thermodynamic laws during training, reducing the need of large\ndata-sets. Moreover the training is more efficient and robust, and the\npredictions more accurate. Finally and more important, the predictions remain\nthermodynamically consistent, even for unseen data. Based on these features,\nTANNs are a starting point for data-driven, physics-based constitutive modeling\nwith neural networks.\n  We demonstrate the wide applicability of TANNs for modeling elasto-plastic\nmaterials, with strain hardening and strain softening. Detailed comparisons\nshow that the predictions of TANNs outperform those of standard ANNs.

At low\nMarangoni numbers, we show that the wave fronts exhibit spanwise oscillations\nbefore eventually acquiring a quasi two-dimensional shape. In addition, the\npresence of Marangoni stresses are found to suppress the peaks of the\ntravelling waves and preceding capillary wave structures. At high Marangoni\nnumbers, a near complete rigidification of the interface is observed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 May 2020 06:00:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-02"}

In the absence of the\ncrust potential, we show that, if we rotate such a bosonic star, it is threaded\nby vortices. We then show, via extensive direct numerical simulations (DNSs),\nthat the interaction of these vortices with the crust potential yields (a)\nstick-slip dynamics and (b) dynamical glitches. We demonstrate that, if enough\nmomentum is transferred to the crust from the bosonic star, then the vortices\nare expelled from the star and the crust's angular momentum $J_c$ exhibits\nfeatures that can be interpreted naturally as glitches. From the time series of\n$J_c$, we compute the cumulative probability distribution functions (CPDFs) of\nevent sizes, event durations, and waiting times. We show that these CPDFs have\nsignatures of self-organized criticality (SOC), which have been seen in\nobservations on pulsar glitches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 May 2020 04:00:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-28"}

The\nquestion of how floating wind systems can be optimized to operate smoothly in\nharsh wind and wave conditions is the subject of the present work. An\nintegrated optimization was conducted, where the hull shape of a\nsemi-submersible, as well as the wind turbine controller were varied with the\ngoal of finding a cost-efficient design, which does not respond to wind and\nwave excitations, resulting in small structural fatigue and extreme loads. The\noptimum design was found to have a remarkably low tower-base fatigue load\nresponse and small rotor fore-aft amplitudes. Further investigations showed\nthat the reason for the good dynamic behavior is a particularly favorable\nresponse to first-order wave loads: The floating wind turbine rotates in\npitch-direction about a point close to the rotor hub and the rotor fore-aft\nmotion is almost unaffected by the wave excitation. As a result, the power\nproduction and the blade loads are not influenced by the waves. A comparable\neffect was so far known for Tension Leg Platforms but not for semi-submersible\nwind turbines. The methodology builds on a low-order simulation model, coupled\nto a parametric panel code model, a detailed viscous drag model and an\nindividually tuned blade pitch controller. The results are confirmed by the\nhigher-fidelity model FAST. A new indicator to express the optimal behavior\nthrough a single design criterion has been developed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 May 2020 11:39:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-28"}

To\ntranslate these results into a widespread technology, attaining ultralow\noptical losses with established foundry manufacturing is critical. Recent\nadvances in fabrication of integrated Si3N4 photonics have shown that\nultralow-loss, dispersion-engineered microresonators can be attained at\ndie-level throughput. For emerging nonlinear applications such as integrated\ntravelling-wave parametric amplifiers and mode-locked lasers, PICs of length\nscales of up to a meter are required, placing stringent demands on yield and\nperformance that have not been met with current fabrication techniques. Here we\novercome these challenges and demonstrate a fabrication technology which meets\nall these requirements on wafer-level yield, performance and length scale.\nPhotonic microresonators with a mean Q factor exceeding 30 million,\ncorresponding to a linear propagation loss of 1.0 dB/m, are obtained over full\n4-inch wafers, as determined from a statistical analysis of tens of thousands\nof optical resonances and cavity ringdown with 19 ns photon storage time. The\nprocess operates over large areas with high yield, enabling 1-meter-long spiral\nwaveguides with 2.4 dB/m loss in dies of only 5x5 mm size. Using a modulation\nresponse measurement self-calibrated via the Kerr nonlinearity, we reveal that,\nstrikingly, the intrinsic absorption-limited Q factor of our Si3N4\nmicroresonators exceeds a billion.

The\nincreasing number of sophisticated, quasi imperceptible attacks raises the\nquestion of countermeasures. In this paper, we focus on hybrid ASR systems and\ncompare four acoustic models regarding their ability to indicate uncertainty\nunder attack: a feed-forward neural network and three neural networks\nspecifically designed for uncertainty quantification, namely a Bayesian neural\nnetwork, Monte Carlo dropout, and a deep ensemble.

When\nthe monoid is not assumed commutative, one may be hard pressed to find an\nexample. One suggested by Professor Orr Shalit are the countable ordinals with\naddition.\n  In this note we attempt an introductory investigation of totally (also\npartially) ordered monoids, not assumed commutative (still writing them\nadditively), and taking them as positive, i.e.\\ every element is greater than\nthe unit element. That, in the usual commutative cases, allows the ordering to\nbe defined via the algebraic structure, namely, as divisibility (in our\nadditive sense): $a\\le b$ defined as $\\exists\\,c\\,\\,(b=a+c)$. The\nnoncommutative case offers several ways to generalize that.\n  First we try to follow the divisibility definition (on the right or on the\nleft). Then, alternatively, we insist on the ordering being compatible with the\noperation both on the left and on the right, but strict inequality may not\ncarry over -- again refer to the ordinals example. We try to see what axiom(s)\nsuch requirements impose on the monoid structure, and some facts are\nestablished.\n  Focusing especially on the totally ordered case, one finds that necessarily\nthe noncommutativity is somewhat limited.
