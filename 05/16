We observe that a modern SoC\ntypically allocates a fixed power budget, corresponding to worst-case\nperformance demands, to the IO and memory domains even if they are\nunderutilized. The resulting unfair allocation of the power budget across\ndomains can cause two major issues: 1) the IO and memory domains can operate at\na higher frequency and voltage than necessary, increasing power consumption and\n2) the unused power budget of the IO and memory domains cannot be used to\nincrease the throughput of the compute domain, hampering performance. To avoid\nthese issues, it is crucial to dynamically orchestrate the distribution of the\nSoC power budget across the three domains based on their actual performance\ndemands.\n  We propose SysScale, a new multi-domain power management technique to improve\nthe energy efficiency of mobile SoCs. SysScale is based on three key ideas.\nFirst, SysScale introduces an accurate algorithm to predict the performance\n(e.g., bandwidth and latency) demands of the three SoC domains. Second,\nSysScale uses a new DVFS (dynamic voltage and frequency scaling) mechanism to\ndistribute the SoC power to each domain according to the predicted performance\ndemands. Third, in addition to using a global DVFS mechanism, SysScale uses\ndomain-specialized techniques to optimize the energy efficiency of each domain\nat different operating points.\n  We implement SysScale on an Intel Skylake microprocessor for mobile devices\nand evaluate it using a wide variety of SPEC CPU2006, graphics (3DMark), and\nbattery life workloads (e.g., video playback). On a 2-core Skylake, SysScale\nimproves the performance of SPEC CPU2006 and 3DMark workloads by up to 16% and\n8.9% (9.2% and 7.9% on average), respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 May 2020 16:08:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 18 May 2020 09:46:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-19"}

Another major challenge facing the stellarator\nprogram is the sensitive dependence of confinement properties on\nelectro-magnetic coil shapes, necessitating the construction of the coils under\ntight tolerances. In this Thesis, we address these challenges with the\napplication of adjoint methods and shape sensitivity analysis. Adjoint methods\nenable the efficient computation of the gradient of a function that depends on\nthe solution to a system of equations, such as linear or nonlinear PDEs. This\nenables gradient-based optimization in high-dimensional spaces and efficient\nsensitivity analysis. We present the first applications of adjoint methods for\nstellarator shape optimization. The first example we discuss is the\noptimization of coil shapes based on the generalization of a continuous current\npotential model. Understanding the sensitivity of coil metrics to perturbations\nof the winding surface allows us to understand features of configurations that\nenable simpler coils. We next consider solutions of the drift-kinetic equation.\nAn adjoint drift-kinetic equation is derived based on the self-adjointness\nproperty of the Fokker-Planck collision operator, allowing us to compute the\nsensitivity of neoclassical quantities to perturbations of the magnetic field\nstrength. Finally, we consider functions that depend on solutions of the MHD\nequilibrium equations. We generalize the self-adjointness property of the MHD\nforce operator to include perturbations of the rotational transform and the\ncurrents outside the confinement region. This self-adjointness property is\napplied to develop an adjoint method for computing the derivatives of such\nfunctions with respect to perturbations of coil shapes or the plasma boundary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 May 2020 16:42:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-18"}

Prior work in imitation learning typically\nrequires each task be specified with a task id or goal image -- something that\nis often impractical in open-world environments. On the other hand, previous\napproaches in instruction following allow agent behavior to be guided by\nlanguage, but typically assume structure in the observations, actuators, or\nlanguage that limit their applicability to complex settings like robotics. In\nthis work, we present a method for incorporating free-form natural language\nconditioning into imitation learning. Our approach learns perception from\npixels, natural language understanding, and multitask continuous control\nend-to-end as a single neural network. Unlike prior work in imitation learning,\nour method is able to incorporate unlabeled and unstructured demonstration data\n(i.e. no task or language labels). We show this dramatically improves language\nconditioned performance, while reducing the cost of language annotation to less\nthan 1% of total data. At test time, a single language conditioned visuomotor\npolicy trained with our method can perform a wide variety of robotic\nmanipulation skills in a 3D environment, specified only with natural language\ndescriptions of each task (e.g. \"open the drawer...now pick up the block...now\npress the green button...\"). To scale up the number of instructions an agent\ncan follow, we propose combining text conditioned policies with large\npretrained neural language models. We find this allows a policy to be robust to\nmany out-of-distribution synonym instructions, without requiring new\ndemonstrations.

In this\nregard, there are two completely different approaches governments can take: a\nrestrictive one, in which drastic measures such as self-isolation can seriously\ndamage the economy, and a more liberal one, where more relaxed restrictions may\nput at risk a high percentage of the population. The optimal approach could be\nsomewhere in between, and, in order to make the right decisions, it is\nnecessary to accurately estimate the future effects of taking one or other\nmeasures.

The conducted experiments prove that our methodology is a valid\ntool to discover actions governments can take to reduce the negative effects of\na pandemic in both senses.

We refer to\nquarantine as strict isolation, and it is applied to confirmed infected cases.\nIn the proposed model, the proportion of people in isolation, the level of\ncontact reduction and the testing rate are control parameters that can vary in\ntime, representing policies that evolve in different stages.

In this\npaper, we introduce an approach to simplify state preparation, together with a\ncircuit optimization technique, both of which can help reduce the circuit\ncomplexity for QAE state preparation significantly. We demonstrate the\nintroduced techniques for a numerical integration example on real quantum\nhardware, as well as for option pricing under the Heston model, i.e., based on\na stochastic volatility process, using simulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 May 2020 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-17"}

In this paper, we present\na method that learns how to represent data in a disentangled way, with minimal\nsupervision, manifested solely using available pre-trained networks. Our key\ninsight is to decouple the processes of disentanglement and synthesis, by\nemploying a leading pre-trained unconditional image generator, such as\nStyleGAN. By learning to map into its latent space, we leverage both its\nstate-of-the-art quality, and its rich and expressive latent space, without the\nburden of training it. We demonstrate our approach on the complex and high\ndimensional domain of human heads. We evaluate our method qualitatively and\nquantitatively, and exhibit its success with de-identification operations and\nwith temporal identity coherency in image sequences. Through extensive\nexperimentation, we show that our method successfully disentangles identity\nfrom other facial attributes, surpassing existing methods, even though they\nrequire more training and supervision.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 May 2020 18:24:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Aug 2020 16:24:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 12:24:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-20"}

The orthorhombic phase\nis sometimes called a nematic phase because quantum oscillation, neutron, and\nother measurements detect a significant asymmetry in $x$ and $y$. How\nnematicity affects superconductivity has recently become a matter of intense\nspeculation. Here we employ an advanced \\emph{ab-initio} Green's function\ndescription of superconductivity and show that bulk tetragonal FeSe would, in\nprinciple, superconduct with almost the same T$_{c}$ as the nematic phase. The\nmechanism driving the observed nematicity is not yet understood. Since the\npresent theory underestimates nematicity, we simulate the full nematic\nasymmetry by artificially enhancing the orthorhombic distortion. For\nbenchmarking, we compare theoretical spin susceptibilities against\nexperimentally observed data over all energies and relevant momenta. When the\northorhombic distortion is adjusted to correlate with observed nematicity in\nspin susceptibility, the enhanced nematicity causes spectral weight\nredistribution in the Fe-3d$_{xz}$ and d$_{yz}$ orbitals, but it leads to at\nmost 10-15$\\%$ increment in T$_{c}$. This is because the d$_{xy}$ orbital\nalways remains the most strongly correlated and provides most of the source of\nthe superconducting glue. Nematicity suppresses the density of states at Fermi\nlevel; nevertheless T$_{c}$ increases, in contradiction to both BCS and BEC\ntheories. We show how the increase is connected to the structure of the\nparticle-particle vertex.

It is known that, at vanishing interactions,\nthe low-energy spectrum of the system studied consists of four almost-flat\nalmost-degenerate bands. Electron-electron repulsion lifts this degeneracy. To\naccount for such an interaction effect, a numerical mean-field theory is used.\nAssuming that the ground state has spin-density-wave-like order, we introduce a\nmulticomponent order parameter describing spin magnetization. Our simulations\nshow that the order parameter structure depends on the doping level. In\nparticular, doping away from the charge neutrality point reduces the rotational\nsymmetry of the ordered state, indicating the appearance of an electron nematic\nstate.

Popular methods in the past have explored image-to-sequence\narchitectures trained with maximum likelihood which have demonstrated\nmeaningful generated questions given an image and its associated ground-truth\nanswer. VQG becomes more challenging if the image contains rich contextual\ninformation describing its different semantic categories. In this paper, we try\nto exploit the different visual cues and concepts in an image to generate\nquestions using a variational autoencoder (VAE) without ground-truth answers.\nOur approach solves two major shortcomings of existing VQG systems: (i)\nminimize the level of supervision and (ii) replace generic questions with\ncategory relevant generations. Most importantly, by eliminating expensive\nanswer annotations, the required supervision is weakened. Using different\ncategories enables us to exploit different concepts as the inference requires\nonly the image and the category. Mutual information is maximized between the\nimage, question, and answer category in the latent space of our VAE. A novel\ncategory consistent cyclic loss is proposed to enable the model to generate\nconsistent predictions with respect to the answer category, reducing\nredundancies and irregularities.

Additionally,\nextending this with an end-to-end emotion prediction neural network provides a\nnetwork that performs SER from audio with lost frames, end-to-end. The proposed\nmodel is compared against the fore-mentioned baselines. Additionally, a\nbidirectional variant with better performance is utilised. For evaluation, we\nchose the public RECOLA dataset given its long audio tracks with continuous\nemotion labels. ConcealNet is evaluated on the reconstruction of the audio and\nthe quality of corresponding emotions predicted after that. The proposed\nConcealNet model has shown considerable improvement, for both audio\nreconstruction and the corresponding emotion prediction, in environments that\ndo not have losses with long duration, even when the losses occur frequently.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 May 2020 20:43:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-19"}

In this work, we consider a class of\nIoT-friendly DLTs based on directed acyclic graphs, rather than a blockchain,\nand with a reputation system in the place of Proof of Work (PoW). However,\nwithout PoW, implementation of these DLTs requires an access control algorithm\nto manage the rate at which nodes can add new transactions to the ledger. We\nmodel the access control problem and present an algorithm that is fair,\nefficient and secure.

For example, our algorithm uses distributed rate setting which is similar\nin nature to transmission control used in the Internet. However, our solution\nfeatures novel adaptations to cope with the adversarial environment of DLTs in\nwhich no individual agent can be trusted.

In this paper, we\ndiscuss a novel cellular fuzzing framework that aims to help security\nresearchers find critical bugs in cellular basebands and similar embedded\nsystems.

Using our proof-of-concept harness, we fuzzed various\nparsers of the Nucleus RTOS-based MediaTek cellular baseband that are\naccessible from rogue base stations. The emulator instrumentation is highly\noptimized, reaching hundreds of executions per second on each core for our\ncomplex test case, around 15k test-cases per second in total.

A common solution to reduce the\ndimension of the parameter space is to explicitly partition the anatomical\nmesh, either into a fixed small number of segments or a multi-scale hierarchy.\nThis anatomy-based reduction of parameter space presents a fundamental\nbottleneck to parameter estimation, resulting in solutions that are either too\nlow in resolution to reflect tissue heterogeneity, or too high in dimension to\nbe reliably estimated within feasible computation.

Motivated by practical applications such as\ninitial beam alignment in array processing, heavy hitter detection in\nnetworking, and visual search in robotics, we consider practically important\ncomplexity constraints/metrics: \\textit{time complexity}, \\textit{computational\nand memory complexity}, and the complexity of possible query sets in terms of\ngeometry and cardinality.\n  Two novel search strategy, $dyaPM$ and $hiePM$, are proposed. Pertinent to\nthe practicality of out solutions, $dyaPM$ and $hiePM$ are of a connected query\ngeometry (i.e. query set is always a connected set) implemented with low\ncomputational and memory complexity. Additionally, $hiePM$ has a hierarchical\nstructure and, hence, a further reduction in the cardinality of possible query\nsets, making $hiePM$ practically suitable for applications such as beamforming\nin array processing where memory limitations favors a smaller codebook size.\n  Through a unified analysis with Extrinsic Jensen Shannon (EJS) Divergence,\n$dyaPM$ is shown to be asymptotically optimal in search time complexity\n(asymptotic in both resolution (rate) and error (reliability)).

The\ndynamics and thinning of films between coalescing droplets can be particularly\ncomplex in the presence of surfactants, due to the generation of Marangoni\nstresses and reduced film mobility. In this work, a microfluidic hydrodynamic\nStokes trap is used to gently steer and trap surfactant-laden micrometer-sized\ndroplets at the center of a cross-slot. Incoming droplets are made to coalesce\nwith the trapped droplet, yielding measurements of the film drainage time.\nWater droplets are formed upstream using a microfluidic T-junction, in heavy\nand light mineral oils and stabilized using SPAN 80, an oil-soluble surfactant.\nFilm drainage times are measured as a function of continuous phase viscosity,\nincoming droplet speed, trapped droplet size, and surfactant concentrations\nabove and below the critical micelle concentration (CMC). As expected, systems\nwith higher surfactant concentrations, higher continuous phase viscosity, and\nslower droplet speed exhibit longer film drainage times. Perhaps more\nsurprisingly, larger droplets and high confinement also result in longer film\ndrainage times. The results are used here to determine critical conditions for\ncoalescence, including both an upper and a lower critical Capillary number.\nMoreover, it is shown that induced surfactant concentration gradient effects\nenable coalescence events after the droplets had originally flocculated, at\nsurfactant concentrations above the CMC. The microfluidic hydrodynamic trap\nprovides new insights into the role of surfactants in film drainage and opens\navenues for controlled coalescence studies at micrometer length scales and\nmillisecond time scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 May 2020 22:52:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-19"}

An intelligent attacker can design stealthy attacks with knowledge\nof the system model and noise characteristics to evade detection from\nstate-of-the-art fault detectors by remaining within detection thresholds.\nHowever, during these hidden attacks, an attacker with the intention of\nhijacking a system will leave traces of non-random behavior that contradict\nwith the expectation of the system model. Given these premises, in this paper\nwe propose a run-time monitor called Cumulative Sign (CUSIGN) detector, for\nidentifying stealthy falsified measurements by identifying if measurements are\nno longer behaving in a random manner. Specifically, our proposed CUSIGN\nmonitor considers the changes in sign of the measurement residuals and their\nexpected occurrence in order to detect if a sensor could be compromised.\nMoreover, our detector is designed to be a memoryless procedure, eliminating\nthe need to store large sequences of data for attack detection.

It can assist manufacturers in making accurate inspection quickly.\nAs the increase of free-form surfaces and diverse surface orientations in auto\nbody design, existing inspection approaches cannot capture some new critical\nfeatures in the curvature of auto bodies in an efficient way. Therefore, we\nneed to develop new path planning methods for automated dimensional inspection\nof free-form surfaces. This paper proposes an optimal path planning system for\nautomated programming of measuring point inspection by incorporating probe\nrotations and effective collision detection. Specifically, the methodological\ncontributions include: (i) a dynamic searching volume-based algorithm is\ndeveloped to detect potential collisions in the local path between measurement\npoints; (ii) a local path generation method is proposed with the integration of\nthe probe trajectory and the stylus rotation. Then, the inspection time matrix\nis proposed to quantify the measuring time of diverse local paths; (iii) an\noptimization approach of the global inspection path for all critical points on\nthe auto body is developed to minimize the total inspection time. A case study\nhas been conducted on an auto body to verify the performance of the proposed\nmethod.

The Merit Function was also valuable for the purposes of advocating the\nMission by illustrating its expected capability.

For instance, person re-identification systems\ntypically rely on a distributed set of cameras, where each camera has different\ncapture conditions. This can translate to a considerable shift between source\n(e.g. lab setting) and target (e.g. operational camera) domains. Given the cost\nof annotating image data captured for fine-tuning in each target domain,\nunsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has become a popular approach to adapt\nCNNs. Moreover, state-of-the-art deep learning models that provide a high level\nof accuracy often rely on architectures that are too complex for real-time\napplications. Although several compression and UDA approaches have recently\nbeen proposed to overcome these limitations, they do not allow optimizing a CNN\nto simultaneously address both. In this paper, we propose an unexplored\ndirection -- the joint optimization of CNNs to provide a compressed model that\nis adapted to perform well for a given target domain. In particular, the\nproposed approach performs unsupervised knowledge distillation (KD) from a\ncomplex teacher model to a compact student model, by leveraging both source and\ntarget data. It also improves upon existing UDA techniques by progressively\nteaching the student about domain-invariant features, instead of directly\nadapting a compact model on target domain data. Our method is compared against\nstate-of-the-art compression and UDA techniques, using two popular\nclassification datasets for UDA -- Office31 and ImageClef-DA.

A classic result in the univariate setting is\nthe Davenport-Mahler-Mignotte (DMM) bound. One way to state the bound is to\nconsider a directed acyclic graph $(V,E)$ on a subset of roots of a degree $d$\npolynomial $f(z) \\in \\mathbb{C}[z]$, where the edges point from a root of\nsmaller absolute value to one of larger absolute, and the in-degrees of all\nvertices is at most one. Then the DMM bound is an amortized lower bound on the\nfollowing product: $\\prod_{(\\alpha,\\beta) \\in E}|\\alpha-\\beta|$. However, the\nlower bound involves the discriminant of the polynomial $f$, and becomes\ntrivial if the polynomial is not square-free. This was resolved by Eigenwillig,\n(2008), by using a suitable subdiscriminant instead of the discriminant.\nEscorcielo-Perrucci, 2016, further dropped the in-degree constraint on the\ngraph by using the theory of finite differences. Emiris et al., 2019, have\ngeneralized their result to handle the case where the exponent of the term\n$|\\alpha-\\beta|$ in the product is at most the multiplicity of either of the\nroots. In this paper, we generalize these results by allowing arbitrary\npositive integer weights on the edges of the graph, i.e., for a weight function\n$w: E \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$, we derive an amortized lower bound on\n$\\prod_{(\\alpha,\\beta) \\in E}|\\alpha-\\beta|^{w(\\alpha,\\beta)}$. Such a product\noccurs in the complexity estimates of some recent algorithms for root\nclustering (e.g., Becker et al., 2016), where the weights are usually some\nfunction of the multiplicity of the roots. Because of its amortized nature, our\nbound is arguably better than the bounds obtained by manipulating existing\nresults to accommodate the weights.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 May 2020 02:16:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-19"}

To the best of our\nknowledge, our model is the first one in the literature which is capable of\ngenerating glyph images in new font styles, instead of retrieving existing\nfonts, according to given values of specified font attributes. Specifically,\nAttribute2Font is trained to perform font style transfer between any two fonts\nconditioned on their attribute values. After training, our model can generate\nglyph images in accordance with an arbitrary set of font attribute values.\nFurthermore, a novel unit named Attribute Attention Module is designed to make\nthose generated glyph images better embody the prominent font attributes.\nConsidering that the annotations of font attribute values are extremely\nexpensive to obtain, a semi-supervised learning scheme is also introduced to\nexploit a large number of unlabeled fonts.

Unlike Boolean group testing algorithms, the\ninput is a quantitative readout from each test and the output is a list of\nviral loads for each sample relative to the pool with the highest viral load.\nWhile other pooling techniques require a second confirmatory assay, Tapestry\nobtains individual sample-level results in a single round of testing, at\nclinically acceptable false positive or false negative rates. We also propose\ndesigns for pooling matrices that facilitate good prediction of the infected\nsamples while remaining practically viable. When testing $n$ samples out of\nwhich $k \\ll n$ are infected, our method needs only $O(k \\log n)$ tests when\nusing random binary pooling matrices, with high probability.

To better understand the reasons why SC developers include or\nexclude the selfdestruct function in their contracts, we conducted an online\nsurvey to collect feedback from them and summarize the key reasons. Their\nfeedback shows that 66.67% of the developers will deploy an updated contract to\nthe Ethereum after destructing the old contract.

In this paper, we propose a\nreceiver approach by the marriage of the OTFS and a large-scale antenna array,\nwhich allows low-complexity detection and low-overhead pilot pattern design.\nFirst, the received signal from each path of the multipath fading channel is\nidentified by a high-resolution receive beamformer facilitated by a large-scale\nantenna array. Then the identified signal from each angle in the delay-Doppler\ndomain reduces to a flat-faded signal, which can be simply equalized using the\nchannel information estimated by our pilot pattern.

We\nalso characterize all the extremal hypergraphs. The difficulty of this case is\ndue to the fact that these extremal examples are rather non-standard.

Since the model has no knowledge about these environments,\npredictions have to be considered uncertain.\n  Estimating the area to which a prediction model can be reliably applied is\nrequired.

For this test, we\nanalyzed photospheric magnetic field and multi-wavelength UV/EUV observations\nof a small-scale flux cancellation event in a quiet-Sun internetwork region\nover a target interval of 5.2 hr. The observed cancellation event exhibits a\nconverging motion of two opposite-polarity magnetic patches on the photosphere\nand red-shifted Doppler velocities (downflows) therein consistently over the\ntarget interval, with a decrease in magnetic flux of both polarities at a rate\nof 10$^{15}$ Mx s$^{-1}$.

Unfortunately, most relevant dynamics involve complex graphs\nof interactions for which an exact computational treatment is impossible. To\ncircumvent this difficulty, the replica-mean-field approach focuses on randomly\ninteracting replicas of the networks of interest. In the limit of an infinite\nnumber of replicas, these networks become analytically tractable under the\nso-called \"Poisson Hypothesis\". However, in most applications, this hypothesis\nis only conjectured. Here, we establish the Poisson Hypothesis for a general\nclass of discrete-time, point-process-based dynamics, that we propose to call\nfragmentation-interaction-aggregation processes, and which are introduced in\nthe present paper. These processes feature a network of nodes, each endowed\nwith a state governing their random activation. Each activation triggers the\nfragmentation of the activated node state and the transmission of interaction\nsignals to downstream nodes. In turn, the signals received by nodes are\naggregated to their state. Our main contribution is a proof of the Poisson\nHypothesis for the replica-mean-field version of any network in this class.

The 2-30 keV light curve and the energy spectra\nconfirm that the luminosity $L_\\mathrm{X}$ reached $2.5\\times 10^{39}$ erg\ns$^{-1}$, 10 times higher than the Eddington limit. When the source was\nluminous with $L_\\mathrm{X}\\gtrsim 0.9\\times 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$, it\nexhibited a negative correlation on a hardness-intensity diagram. However, two\nhardness ratios, a soft color ($=$ 4-10 keV / 2-4 keV) and a hard color ($=$\n10-20 keV / 4-10 keV), showed somewhat different behavior across a\ncharacteristic luminosity of $L_\\mathrm{c}\\simeq 5\\times 10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$.\nThe soft color changed more than the hard color when $L_\\mathrm{X} <\nL_\\mathrm{c}$, whereas the opposite was observed above $L_\\mathrm{c}$.

These spectral and pulse-shape properties can be interpreted by\na scenario that the accretion columns on the neutron star surface, producing\nthe Comptonized X-ray emission, gradually became taller as $L_\\mathrm{X}$\nincreased.

Existing MER systems exploit\nCNN networks to spot the significant features of minor muscle movements and\nsubtle changes. However, existing networks fail to establish a relationship\nbetween spatial features of facial appearance and temporal variations of facial\ndynamics. Thus, these networks were not able to effectively capture minute\nvariations and subtle changes in expressive regions. To address these issues,\nwe introduce an active imaging concept to segregate active changes in\nexpressive regions of a video into a single frame while preserving facial\nappearance information. Moreover, we propose a shallow CNN network: hybrid\nlocal receptive field based augmented learning network (OrigiNet) that\nefficiently learns significant features of the micro-expressions in a video. In\nthis paper, we propose a new refined rectified linear unit (RReLU), which\novercome the problem of vanishing gradient and dying ReLU.

The performance of proposed\nOrigiNet is evaluated by conducting leave one subject out experiments on four\ncomprehensive ME datasets.

We recovered maximum posteriori estimates of\nthe model parameters using time series of new cases, daily deaths, and tests\nfor the UK. These parameters were used to simulate the trajectory of the\noutbreak in the UK over an 18-month period. Several clear-cut conclusions\nemerged from these simulations.

In practice, these prices are\nhighly volatile as they largely depend upon a range of variables such as\nelectricity demand and the feed-in from renewable energy sources. Hence,\naccurate forecasts are demanded.\n  Approach: This paper aims at comparing different predictors stemming from\nsupply-side (solar and wind power generation), demand-side, fuel-related and\neconomic influences. For this reason, we implement a broad range of non-linear\nmodels from machine learning and draw upon the information-fusion-based\nsensitivity analysis.\n  Findings: We disentangle the respective relevance of each predictor.

A variant of the classical compartmental SEIR model, called the SEIQRDP\nmodel, is used. As South Africa is still in the early phases of the global\nCOVID-19 pandemic with the confirmed infectious cases not having peaked, the\nSEIQRDP model is first parameterized on data for Germany, Italy, and South\nKorea - countries for which the number of infectious cases are well past their\npeaks. Good fits are achieved with reasonable predictions of where the number\nof COVID-19 confirmed cases, deaths, and recovered cases will end up and by\nwhen. South African data for the period from 23 March to 8 May 2020 is then\nused to obtain SEIQRDP model parameters. It is found that the model fits the\ninitial disease progression well, but that the long-term predictive capability\nof the model is rather poor. The South African SEIQRDP model is subsequently\nrecalculated with the basic reproduction number constrained to reported values.\nThe resulting model fits the data well, and long-term predictions appear to be\nreasonable. The South African SEIQRDP model predicts that the peak in the\nnumber of confirmed infectious individuals will occur at the end of October\n2020, and that the total number of deaths will range from about 10,000 to\n90,000, with a nominal value of about 22,000. All of these predictions are\nheavily dependent on the disease control measures in place, and the adherence\nto these measures. These predictions are further shown to be particularly\nsensitive to parameters used to determine the basic reproduction number. The\nfuture aim is to use a feedback control approach together with the South\nAfrican SEIQRDP model to determine the epidemiological impact of varying\nlockdown levels proposed by the South African Government.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 May 2020 15:11:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 May 2020 14:47:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-25"}

As the sailcraft transits Alpha Centauri\nat 0.2 c, it looks for signs of life by imaging planets and gathering other\nscientific data.

The present work estimates the raw data\nrate of a 1.02 {\\mu}m, 100 Watt laser that is received at 1.25 {\\mu}m by a\n30-meter telescope. The telescope receives 288 signal photons per second (-133\ndBm) from the sailcraft after accounting for optical gains (+296 dBi),\nconventional losses (-476 dB), relativistic effects (-3.5 dB), and link margin\n(-3.0 dB). For this photon-starved Poisson channel with 0.1 nm equivalent noise\nbandwidth, 90% detector quantum efficiency, 1024-ary PPM modulation, and 10^-3\nraw bit error rate, the raw data rate is 260 bit/s (hard-decision) to 1.5\nkbit/s (ideal) raw data rate, which is 8-50 Gbit/year. This rate is slowed by\nnoise, especially starlight from Alpha Centauri A scattered into the detector\nby the atmosphere and receiver optics as sailcraft nears the star. Because this\nis a flyby mission (the sailcraft does not stop in the Centauri system), the\nproper motion of Alpha Centauri relative to Earth carries it away from the\nsailcraft after transit, and the noise subsides over days to weeks. The\ndownlink can resume as soon as a day after transit, starting at 7-22 bit/s and\nreaching nearly full speed after 4 months.

Traditional\nsingle-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) techniques use molecules of\nvariable sizes (as determined by its localization precisions (LPs)) to\nreconstruct super-resolution map. This results in an image with overlapping and\nsuperimposing PSFs (due to a wide size-spectrum of single molecules) that\ndegrade image resolution. Ideally it should be possible to identify the\nbrightest molecules (also termed as, fortunate molecules) to reconstruct\nultra-superresolution map, provided sufficient statistics is available from the\nrecorded data. POSSIBLE microscopy explores this possibility by introducing\nnarrow probability size-distribution of single molecules (narrow size-spectrum\nabout a predefined mean-size). The reconstruction begins by presetting the mean\nand variance of the narrow distribution function (Gaussian function).\nSubsequently, the dataset is processed and single molecule filtering is carried\nout by the Gaussian distribution function to filter out unfortunate molecules.\nThe fortunate molecules thus retained are then mapped to reconstruct\nultra-superresolution map. In-principle, the POSSIBLE microscopy technique is\ncapable of infinite resolution (resolution of the order of actual single\nmolecule size) provided enough fortunate molecules are experimentally detected.\nIn short, bright molecules (with large emissivity) holds the key.

In this paper, we propose a new\nframework called Ventral-Dorsal Networks (VDNets) which is inspired by the\nstructure of the human visual system. Roughly, the visual input signal is\nanalyzed along two separate neural streams, one in the temporal lobe and the\nother in the parietal lobe. The coarse functional distinction between these\nstreams is between object recognition -- the \"what\" of the signal -- and\nextracting location related information -- the \"where\" of the signal. The\nventral pathway from primary visual cortex, entering the temporal lobe, is\ndominated by \"what\" information, while the dorsal pathway, into the parietal\nlobe, is dominated by \"where\" information. Inspired by this structure, we\npropose the integration of a \"Ventral Network\" and a \"Dorsal Network\", which\nare complementary. Information about object identity can guide localization,\nand location information can guide attention to relevant image regions,\nimproving object recognition.

We carefully present two\ninstantiations of the mechanisms for median and robust regression estimation\nwith corresponding experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 May 2020 04:53:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-22"}

The proposed method is\na synergy of two recently developed frameworks for solving problems involving\nparametric DEs, 1) the Theory of Functional Connections, TFC, and the\nPhysics-Informed Neural Networks, PINN. Although this paper focuses on the\nsolution of exact problems involving parametric DEs (i.e. problems where the\nmodeling error is negligible) with known parameters, X-TFC can also be used for\ndata-driven solutions and data-driven discovery of parametric DEs. In the\nproposed method, the latent solution of the parametric DEs is approximated by a\nTFC constrained expression that uses a Neural Network (NN) as the\nfree-function. This approximate solution form always analytically satisfies the\nconstraints of the DE, while maintaining a NN with unconstrained parameters,\nlike the Deep-TFC method. X-TFC differs from PINN and Deep-TFC; whereas PINN\nand Deep-TFC use a deep-NN, X-TFC uses a single-layer NN, or more precisely, an\nExtreme Learning Machine, ELM. This choice is based on the properties of the\nELM algorithm. In order to numerically validate the method, it was tested over\na range of problems including the approximation of solutions to linear and\nnon-linear ordinary DEs (ODEs), systems of ODEs (SODEs), and partial DEs\n(PDEs). Furthermore, a few of these problems are of interest in physics and\nengineering such as the Classic Emden-Fowler equation, the Radiative Transfer\n(RT) equation, and the Heat-Transfer (HT) equation. The results show that X-TFC\nachieves high accuracy with low computational time and thus it is comparable\nwith the other state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 15 May 2020 22:51:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-22"}

Traditional machine learning\nmethods are easy to interpret but have low accuracies. The development of deep\nlearning models boosts the performance significantly. However, deep learning\nmodels are typically hard to interpret. In this work, we propose interpretable\ncapsule networks (iCapsNets) to bridge this gap. iCapsNets use capsules to\nmodel semantic meanings and explore novel methods to increase interpretability.\nThe design of iCapsNets is consistent with human intuition and enables it to\nproduce human-understandable interpretation results. Notably, iCapsNets can be\ninterpreted both locally and globally. In terms of local interpretability,\niCapsNets offer a simple yet effective method to explain the predictions for\neach data sample. On the other hand, iCapsNets explore a novel way to explain\nthe model's general behavior, achieving global interpretability. Experimental\nstudies show that our iCapsNets yield meaningful local and global\ninterpretation results, without suffering from significant performance loss\ncompared to non-interpretable methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 16 May 2020 04:11:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-02"}
