Therefore, careful engineering of\nthe sample termination is required. Similarly, magnetic textures, whose quantum\nfluctuations determine the supported magnonic excitations, tend to relax to new\nconfigurations that may also break crystalline symmetries when boundaries are\nintroduced. Here we uncover that antiskyrmion crystals provide an\nexperimentally accessible platform to realize a magnonic topological quadrupole\ninsulator, whose hallmark signature are robust magnonic corner states.\nFurthermore, we show that tuning an applied magnetic field can trigger the\nself-assembly of antiskyrmions carrying a fractional topological charge along\nthe sample edges. Crucially, these fractional antiskyrmions restore the\nsymmetries needed to enforce the emergence of the magnonic corner states. Using\nthe machinery of nested Wilson loops, adapted to magnonic systems supported by\nnoncollinear magnetic textures, we demonstrate the quantization of the bulk\nquadrupole moment, edge dipole moments, and corner charges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 May 2020 16:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 May 2020 09:40:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-16"}

In this paper, a model-based convolutional neural network (CNN)\nmodel, referred to as Algorithm Unrolling Image Fusion (AUIF), is proposed to\novercome the shortcomings of traditional CNN-based IVIF models. The proposed\nAUIF model starts with the iterative formulas of two traditional optimization\nmodels, which are established to accomplish two-scale decomposition, i.e.,\nseparating low-frequency base information and high-frequency detail information\nfrom source images. Then the algorithm unrolling is implemented where each\niteration is mapped to a CNN layer and each optimization model is transformed\ninto a trainable neural network. Compared with the general network\narchitectures, the proposed framework combines the model-based prior\ninformation and is designed more reasonably. After the unrolling operation, our\nmodel contains two decomposers (encoders) and an additional reconstructor\n(decoder). In the training phase, this network is trained to reconstruct the\ninput image. While in the test phase, the base (or detail) decomposed feature\nmaps of infrared/visible images are merged respectively by an extra fusion\nlayer, and then the decoder outputs the fusion image.

Our set-up reduces\nto the SM for small values of the Higgs field, and allows for inflation in the\nopposite large field regime. The one-loop beta functions in the inflationary\nregion are calculated using a covariant approach that properly accounts for the\nnon-trivial structure of the field space manifold. We run the SM parameters\nfrom the electroweak to the inflationary scale, matching the couplings of the\ndifferent effective field theories at the boundary between the two regimes,\nwhere we also include threshold corrections that parametrize effects from UV\nphysics. We then compute the spectral index and tensor-to-scalar ratio and find\nthat RG flow corrections can be determinant: a scenario that is ruled out at\ntree level can be resurrected and vice versa.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 May 2020 16:30:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-28"}

First, we\nreview the evidential requirements to bring a claim under EU non-discrimination\nlaw. Due to the disparate nature of algorithmic and human discrimination, the\nEU's current requirements are too contextual, reliant on intuition, and open to\njudicial interpretation to be automated. Second, we show how the legal\nprotection offered by non-discrimination law is challenged when AI, not humans,\ndiscriminate. Humans discriminate due to negative attitudes (e.g. stereotypes,\nprejudice) and unintentional biases (e.g. organisational practices or\ninternalised stereotypes) which can act as a signal to victims that\ndiscrimination has occurred. Finally, we examine how existing work on fairness\nin machine learning lines up with procedures for assessing cases under EU\nnon-discrimination law. We propose \"conditional demographic disparity\" (CDD) as\na standard baseline statistical measurement that aligns with the European Court\nof Justice's \"gold standard.\" Establishing a standard set of statistical\nevidence for automated discrimination cases can help ensure consistent\nprocedures for assessment, but not judicial interpretation, of cases involving\nAI and automated systems.

Here we focus on one of\nthese risks - quantum key-recovery attacks against ideal ciphers. Specifically,\nwe seek to model the risk posed by an economically motivated quantum attacker\nwho will choose to run a quantum key-recovery attack against an ideal cipher if\nthe cost to recover the secret key is less than the value of the information at\nthe time when the key-recovery attack is complete. In our analysis we introduce\nthe concept of a quantum cipher circuit year to measure the cost of a quantum\nattack. This concept can be used to model the inherent tradeoff between the\ntotal time to run a quantum key recovery attack and the total work required to\nrun said attack. Our model incorporates the time value of the encrypted\ninformation to predict whether any time/work tradeoff results in a key-recovery\nattack with positive utility for the attacker. We make these predictions under\nvarious projections of advances in quantum computing. We use these predictions\nto make recommendations for the future use and deployment of symmetric key\nciphers to secure information against these quantum key-recovery attacks.

Using the phonon Boltzmann transport equation, we\nfind that they all have ultralow lattice thermal conductivities. By analyzing\ntheir vibrational properties, these are attributed to soft phonon modes derived\nfrom the loosely bound rattling-like metal atoms and to strong anharmonicities\ncaused by the vibrations of all atoms perpendicular to the strongly bound\nnonmetallic dimers. Additionally, by correlating those properties along the\nseries, we elucidate a number of chemical trends. We find that heavier atom\nmasses, larger atomic displacement parameters and longer bond lengths between\nmetal and nonmetal atoms can be beneficial to the looser rattling of the metal\natoms and therefore lead to softer phonon modes, and that stronger nonmetallic\ndimer bonds can boost the anharmonicities, both leading to lower thermal\nconductivities.

The new logics have\nbeen obtained from standard logics with two principal extensions: temporal\nlogics, like LTL and CTL$^*$, have been generalized to hyperproperties by\nadding variables for traces or paths. First-order and second-order logics, like\nmonadic first-order logic of order and MSO, have been extended with the\nequal-level predicate. We study the impact of the two extensions across the\nspectrum of linear-time and branching-time logics, in particular for logics\nwith quantification over propositions. The resulting hierarchy of hyperlogics\ndiffers significantly from the classical hierarchy, suggesting that the\nequal-level predicate adds more expressiveness than trace and path variables.\nWithin the hierarchy of hyperlogics, we identify new boundaries on the\ndecidability of the satisfiability problem.

We show that memory safety is only one aspect, and that\nPAC compilers can provide significant additional security guarantees for\npartial programs: the compiler can provide security guarantees for a\ncompilation unit, even if that compilation unit is later linked to\nattacker-provided machine code.\n  As such, this paper is the first to study the security of PAC compilers for\npartial programs formally. We prove for a model of such a compiler that it is\nfully abstract. The proof uses a novel proof technique (dubbed TrICL, read\ntrickle), which should be of broad interest because it reuses the whole-program\ncompiler correctness relation for full abstraction, thus saving work. We also\nimplement our scheme for C on CHERI, show that we can compile legacy C code\nwith minimal changes, and show that the performance overhead of compiled code\nis roughly proportional to the number of cross-compilation-unit function calls.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 May 2020 17:43:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 May 2021 05:35:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-05"}

To\nevaluate the socio-economic impact of COVID-19 on individuals, a micro-economic\nmodel is developed to estimate the direct impact of distancing on household\nincome, savings, consumption, and poverty. The model assumes two periods: a\ncrisis period during which some individuals experience a drop in income and can\nuse their precautionary savings to maintain consumption; and a recovery period,\nwhen households save to replenish their depleted savings to pre-crisis level.\nThe San Francisco Bay Area is used as a case study, and the impacts of a\nlockdown are quantified, accounting for the effects of unemployment insurance\n(UI) and the CARES Act federal stimulus. Assuming a shelter-in-place period of\nthree months, the poverty rate would temporarily increase from 17.1% to 25.9%\nin the Bay Area in the absence of social protection, and the lowest income\nearners would suffer the most in relative terms. If fully implemented, the\ncombination of UI and CARES could keep the increase in poverty close to zero,\nand reduce the average recovery time, for individuals who suffer an income\nloss, from 11.8 to 6.7 months. However, the severity of the economic impact is\nspatially heterogeneous, and certain communities are more affected than the\naverage and could take more than a year to recover. Overall, this model is a\nfirst step in quantifying the household-level impacts of COVID-19 at a regional\nscale. This study can be extended to explore the impact of indirect\nmacroeconomic effects, the role of uncertainty in households' decision-making\nand the potential effect of simultaneous exogenous shocks (e.g., natural\ndisasters).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 May 2020 17:43:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-06"}

Prior\nwork in offline RL has been confined almost exclusively to model-free RL\napproaches. In this work, we present MOReL, an algorithmic framework for\nmodel-based offline RL. This framework consists of two steps: (a) learning a\npessimistic MDP (P-MDP) using the offline dataset; and (b) learning a\nnear-optimal policy in this P-MDP. The learned P-MDP has the property that for\nany policy, the performance in the real environment is approximately\nlower-bounded by the performance in the P-MDP. This enables it to serve as a\ngood surrogate for purposes of policy evaluation and learning, and overcome\ncommon pitfalls of model-based RL like model exploitation. Theoretically, we\nshow that MOReL is minimax optimal (up to log factors) for offline RL. Through\nexperiments, we show that MOReL matches or exceeds state-of-the-art results in\nwidely studied offline RL benchmarks.

SatGen emulates cosmological zoom-in hydro-simulations in certain\naspects. Satellites can reside in cored or cuspy DM subhaloes, depending on the\nhalo response to baryonic physics that can be formulated from hydro-simulations\nand physical modeling. The subhalo profile and the stellar mass and size of a\nsatellite evolves depending on its tidal mass loss and initial structure. The\nhost galaxy can include a baryonic disc and a stellar bulge, each described by\na density profile that allows analytic orbit integration. SatGen complements\nsimulations by propagating the effect of halo response found in simulated field\ngalaxies to satellites (not properly resolved in simulations) and outperforms\nsimulations by sampling the halo-to-halo variance of satellite statistics and\novercoming artificial disruption due to insufficient resolution. As a first\napplication, we use the model to study satellites of Milky Way sized hosts,\nmaking it emulate simulations of bursty star formation and of smooth star\nformation, respectively, and to experiment with a disc potential in the host\nhalo. Our model reproduces the observed satellite statistics reasonably well.\nDifferent physical recipes make a difference in satellite abundance and spatial\ndistribution at the 25% level, not large enough to be distinguished by current\nobservations given the halo-to-halo variance.

Here, we study the role of substrate stiffness in\ntissue spreading, which we describe by means of an active polar fluid model.\nTaking into account that cells exert larger active traction forces on stiffer\nsubstrates, we predict a tissue wetting transition at a critical substrate\nstiffness that decreases with tissue size. On substrates with a stiffness\ngradient, we find that the tissue spreads faster on the stiffer side. Further,\nwe show that the tissue can wet the substrate on the stiffer side while\ndewetting from the softer side. We also show that, by means of viscous forces\ntransmitted across the tissue, the stiffer-side interface can transiently drag\nthe softer-side interface towards increasing stiffness, against its spreading\ntendency. These two effects result in directed tissue migration up the\nstiffness gradient. This phenomenon -- tissue durotaxis -- can thus emerge both\nfrom dewetting at the soft side and from hydrodynamic interactions between the\ntissue interfaces. Overall, our work unveils mechanisms whereby substrate\nstiffness impacts the collective migration and the active wetting properties of\nliving tissues, which are relevant in development, regeneration, and cancer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 May 2020 19:01:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-14"}

Two\nlimit cases have been studied, in order to analyse the characteristic regimes\nof the fishbone instability : the weak kinetic drive limit and the strong\nkinetic drive limit. In both those regimes, characteristic features of the n =\nm = 1 fishbone instability are recovered, such as a strong up/down-chirping of\nthe mode frequency, associated with a resonant transport of trapped and passing\nalpha particles. The effects of the n = m = 0 sheared poloidal and toroidal\nplasma rotation are taken into account in the simulations. The shear is not\nnegligible, which implies that the fishbone mode frequency has a radial\ndependency, impacting the wave-particle resonance condition. Phase space hole\nand clump structures are observed in both nonlinear regimes, centered around\nthe precessional and passing resonances. These structures remains attached to\nthe resonances as the different mode frequencies chirp up and down. In the\nnonlinear phase, the transport of individual resonant trapped particles is\nidentified to be linked to mode-particle synchronization. On this basis, a\npartial mechanism for the nonlinear coupling between particle transport and\nmode dominant down-chirping is proposed.

The formal analysis\nhere is only directly applicable to tetraquarks with large angular momentum and\nhence does not directly apply to experimentally observed tetraquark candidates.\nWe also discuss the condition needed for a version of the analysis to apply for\nlow angular momenta states. Whether this condition holds can be explored via\nlattice calculations. Current lattice calculations suggest that the condition\nis not met. If these preliminary calculations are confirmed, there are strong\nimplications for the nature of the observed tetraquark resonances containing\n$\\bar{c}c$ or $\\bar{b}b$ pairs. It raises the possibility that the observed\ntetraquarks exist and are narrow not because the charm and bottom quarks are\nextremely heavy, but because they are sufficiently light.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 May 2020 19:27:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 Aug 2020 17:28:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-02"}

It was recently modeled as an eccentric binary with a\nperiodic brightening at periastron of the emission originating in a shock\nheated zone near the companion. The focus of this paper is to further test the\nbinary model and to constrain the nature of the unseen close companion by\nsearching for emission arising in the shock-heated region. We analyze over 400\nhigh resolution the International Ultraviolet Explorer spectra obtained between\n1983 and 1995 and XMM-Newton observations obtained in 2010. The light curve and\nradial velocity (RV) variations were fit with the eccentric binary model and\nthe orbital elements were constrained. We find RV variations in the primary\nemission lines with a semi-amplitude K$_1\\sim$30 km/s in 1992 and 1995, and a\nsecond set of emissions with an anti-phase RV curve with K$_2\\sim$150 km/s. The\nsimultaneous model fit to the RVs and the light curve yields the orbital\nelements for each epoch. Adopting a Wolf-Rayet mass M$_1\\sim$20 M$_\\odot$ leads\nto M$_2\\sim$3-5 M$_\\odot$, which implies that the companion could be a late\nB-type star. The eccentric (e=0.1) binary model also explains the hard X-ray\nlight curve obtained by XMM-Newton and the fit to these data indicates that the\nduration of maximum is shorter than the typical exposure times. The anti-phase\nRV variations of two emission components and the simultaneous fit to the RVs\nand the light curve are concrete evidence in favor of the binary nature of EZ\nCanis Majoris. The assumption that the emission from the shock-heated region\nclosely traces the orbit of the companion is less certain, although it is\nfeasible because the companion is significantly heated by the WR radiation\nfield and impacted by the WR wind.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 May 2020 19:41:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-08"}

Previous expression recognition methods, either\noverlooked this issue or resolved it using extreme assumptions. Motivated by\nthe fact that the human visual system is adept at ignoring the occlusion and\nfocus on non-occluded facial areas, we propose a landmark-guided attention\nbranch to find and discard corrupted features from occluded regions so that\nthey are not used for recognition. An attention map is first generated to\nindicate if a specific facial part is occluded and guide our model to attend to\nnon-occluded regions. To further improve robustness, we propose a facial region\nbranch to partition the feature maps into non-overlapping facial blocks and\ntask each block to predict the expression independently. This results in more\ndiverse and discriminative features, enabling the expression recognition system\nto recover even though the face is partially occluded. Depending on the\nsynergistic effects of the two branches, our occlusion-adaptive deep network\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on two challenging\nin-the-wild benchmark datasets and three real-world occluded expression\ndatasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 May 2020 20:42:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-14"}

A key\ncomponent of such ability is the compositional recognition that human can\nperform, which has been well studied in cognitive science but is not well\nexplored in FSL. Inspired by such capability of humans, to imitate humans'\nability of learning visual primitives and composing primitives to recognize\nnovel classes, we propose an approach to FSL to learn a feature representation\ncomposed of important primitives, which is jointly trained with two parts, i.e.\nprimitive discovery and primitive enhancing. In primitive discovery, we focus\non learning primitives related to object parts by self-supervision from the\norder of image splits, avoiding extra laborious annotations and alleviating the\neffect of semantic gaps. In primitive enhancing, inspired by current studies on\nthe interpretability of deep networks, we provide our composition view for the\nFSL baseline model. To modify this model for effective composition, inspired by\nboth mathematical deduction and biological studies (the Hebbian Learning rule\nand the Winner-Take-All mechanism), we propose a soft composition mechanism by\nenlarging the activation of important primitives while reducing that of others,\nso as to enhance the influence of important primitives and better utilize these\nprimitives to compose novel classes.

One representative example is quantum\nfingerprinting, in which the simultaneous message passing model is considered\nand the minimum amount of communication could be exponentially smaller than the\nclassical fingerprinting protocol. Experimental demonstrations based on a\npractical quantum fingerprinting protocol where coherent states are used to\nconstruct the fingerprints, have successfully shown the superiority of quantum\nfingerprinting. However, as a consequence of using coherent states, the\ncommunication time in this coherent quantum fingerprinting (CQF) protocol is\nincreased. Moreover, the minimum amount of information communicated in these\nexperimental demonstrations is largely limited by the dark counts of the single\nphoton detectors. Here, we propose to enhance the performance of the existing\nCQF protocol through applying wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) and\nsimultaneous detection of multiple wavelength channels. We show that the new\nWDM-CQF protocol can potentially reduce the communication time significantly.\nMore importantly, with the same experimental parameters, the amount of\ncommunication is much reduced in the new scheme compared with the original CQF\nprotocol. The more wavelength channels are used, the less communication is\nrequired by WDM-CQF protocol. We also perform a proof-of-concept experimental\ndemonstration of the new WDM-CQF protocol with 6 wavelength channels. The\nexperimental results further validate that the new scheme with WDM not only\nbeats the classical protocol, but also reduces the amount of communication\nrequired by the original CQF protocol by more than half.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 May 2020 21:02:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-06"}

New studies suggest that this phenomenon could lead to higher-order\nequations in the context of homogeneous and isotropic Universe, affecting the\nwell-posedness of their Cauchy initial-value problem.

However, depending on the molecular species and the physical conditions\nof the environment, the circumstellar isotopologue ratio may deviate\nconsiderably from the stellar atmospheric value. In this paper, we aim to\nexamine how the CO and HCN abundance ratios vary radially due to chemical\nreactions in the outflows of AGB stars and the effect of excitation and optical\ndepth on the resulting line intensity ratios. We find that the circumstellar\n12CO/13CO can deviate from its atmospheric value by up to 25-94% and 6-60% for\nC- and O-type CSEs, respectively. We show that variations of the intensity of\nthe ISRF and the gas kinetic temperature can significantly influence the CO\nisotopologue ratio in the outer CSEs. On the contrary, the H12CN/H13CN ratio is\nstable for all tested mass-loss rates. The RT modeling shows that the\nintegrated line intensity ratio of CO of different rotational transitions\nvaries significantly for stars with intermediate mass-loss rates due to\ncombined chemical and excitation effects. In contrast, the excitation\nconditions for the both HCN isotopologues are the same. We demonstrate the\nimportance of using the isotopologue abundance profiles from chemical models as\ninputs to RT models in the interpretation of isotopologue observations.\nPrevious studies of CO isotopologue ratios are based on multi-transition data\nfor individual sources and it is difficult to estimate the errors in the\nreported values due to assumptions that are not entirely correct according to\nthis study. If anything, previous studies may have overestimated the\ncircumstellar 12CO/13CO abundance ratio. The use of the HCN as a tracer of C\nisotope ratios is affected by fewer complicating problems, provided one\naccounts corrections for high optical depths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 May 2020 21:44:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

Aims: We\nstudy six recurrent jets occurring in the active region NOAA 12644 on April 04,\n2017. They are observed in all the hot filters of AIA as well as cool surges in\nIRIS slit-jaw high spatial and temporal resolution images. Methods: The AIA\nfilters allow us to study the temperature and the emission measure of the jets\nusing the filter ratio method. We study the pre-jet phases by analyzing the\nintensity oscillations at the base of the jets with the wavelet technique.\nResults: A fine co-alignment of the AIA and IRIS data shows that the jets are\ninitiated at the top of a canopy-like, double-chambered structure with cool\nemission on one side and hot emission in the other. The hot jets are collimated\nin the hot temperature filters, have high velocities (around 250 km/s) and\naccompanied by the cool surges and ejected kernels both moving at about 45\nkm/s. In the pre-phase of the jets, at their base we find quasi-periodic\nintensity oscillations in phase with small ejections; they have a period\nbetween 2 and 6 minutes and are reminiscent of acoustic or MHD waves.\nConclusions: This series of jets and surges provides a good case-study to test\nthe 2D and 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) models that result from magnetic flux\nemergence. The double-chambered structure found in the observations corresponds\nto the cold and hot loop regions found in the models beneath the current sheet\nthat contains the reconnection site.

A\nprimary objective is to determine whether waves refract as monochromatic waves\nby Snell's law with phase velocity or as wave packets. The refraction of wave\npackets requires two refraction laws. The wave packets refract according to\nSnell's law with the geometric group velocity while the wavelets within the\nwave packets refract according to Snell's law with phase velocity. The tests\nwere performed using directional power spectra from gravity water waves\noriginating in the Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, Indian Ocean, and the\nSouthern Ocean. In all cases the waves were measured with arrays of pressure\nsensors. It was found that the refraction of monochromatic waves led to\nbacktracks from a measurement site that spread out for the different wave\nperiods and did not go back to a common source. When the refraction was large\nthe results were especially bad. When the data were used to test the refraction\nof wave packets very good results were obtained. For every storm considered the\nbacktracks of the different wave periods went back together to the wave\ngeneration area. These results offer strong support for refracting waves in\ndispersive media as wave packets, not as monochromatic waves. This result for\nwave groups was also determined in a controlled wave tank experiment of gravity\nwater waves where a critical angle was tested. The properties of propagating\nwave packets are also considered and illustrated. Reflection points and\ncritical angles are found and explained. There can be major differences between\nthe propagation of wave packets and monochromatic waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 May 2020 22:17:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-14"}

Perhaps the clearest manifestation\nof isospin within nuclei is in the near-identical structure of excited states\nin mirror nuclei: nuclei with inverted numbers of protons and neutrons. Isospin\nsymmetry, and therefore mirror-symmetry, is broken by electromagnetic\ninteractions and the difference in the masses of the up and down quarks. A\nrecent study by Hoff and collaborators presented evidence that the ground-state\nspin of $^{73}$Sr is different from that of its mirror, $^{73}$Br, due to an\ninversion of the ground- and first-excited states, separated by only 27 keV in\nthe $^{73}$Br system. In this brief note, we place this inversion within the\nnecessary context of the past half-century of experimental and theoretical\nwork, and show that it is entirely consistent with normal behaviour, and\naffords no new insight into isospin-symmetry breaking. The essential point is\nthat isospin-breaking effects due to the Coulomb interaction frequently vary\nfrom level to level within a given medium-mass nucleus by as much as 200 keV.\nAny level splitting smaller than this is liable to manifest a level inversion\nin the mirror partner which, absent disagreement with an appropriate nuclear\nmodel, does not challenge our understanding. While we note the novelty of an\ninversion in nuclear ground states, we emphasize that in the context of isospin\nthere is nothing specifically illuminating about the ground state, or a level\ninversion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 12 May 2020 23:46:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-07"}

However, many applications exhibit irregular access patterns that do\nnot manifest spatio-temporal locality in the memory address space. Such\napplications usually do not fall under the scope of existing prefetching\ntechniques, which observe only the stream of addresses dispatched by the memory\nunit but not the code flows that produce them. Similarly, temporal correlation\nprefetchers detect recurring relations between accesses, but do not track the\nchain of causality in program code that manifested the memory locality.\nConversely, techniques that are code-aware are limited to the basic program\nfunctionality and are bounded by the machine depth. In this paper we show that\ncontextual analysis of the code flows that generate memory accesses can detect\nrecurring code patterns and expose their underlying semantics even for\nirregular access patterns. Moreover, program locality artifacts can be used to\nenhance the memory traversal code and predict future accesses. We present the\nsemantic prefetcher that analyzes programs at run-time and learns their memory\ndependency chains and address calculation flows. The prefetcher then constructs\nforecast slices and injects them at key points to trigger timely prefetching of\nfuture contextually-related iterations.

It is\ncontinuously widening, as the wealth of a relatively small group increases and,\ntherefore, the rest of the world shares a shrinking fraction of resources. This\nsituation has been predicted and denounced by economists and econophysicists.\nThe latter ones have widely used models of market dynamics which consider that\nwealth distribution is the result of wealth exchanges among economic agents. A\nsimple analogy relates the wealth in a society with the kinetic energy of the\nmolecules in a gas, and the trade between agents to the energy exchange between\nthe molecules during collisions. However, while in physical systems, thanks to\nthe equipartition of energy, the gas eventually arrives at an equilibrium\nstate, in many exchange models the economic system never equilibrates. Instead,\nit moves toward a \"condensed\" state, where one or a few agents concentrate all\nthe wealth of the society and the rest of agents shares zero or a very small\nfraction of the total wealth. Here we discuss two ways of avoiding the\n\"condensed\" state. On one hand, we consider a regulatory policy that favors the\npoorest agent in the exchanges, thus increasing the probability that the wealth\ngoes from the richest to the poorest agent. On the other hand, we study a tax\nsystem and its effects on wealth distribution. We compare the redistribution\nprocesses and conclude that complete control of the inequalities can be\nattained with simple regulations or interventions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 May 2020 01:37:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}

The idea is to generate adversarial examples, targeted or untargeted,\nusing conventional attacks such as FGSM and then feed them back to the\nclassifier. By computing the statistics (here simply mean maps) of the images\nin different categories and comparing them with the statistics of a reference\nmodel, it is possible to visually locate the perturbed regions and unveil the\nattack.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 May 2020 01:38:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-14"}

Originally prototyped by Polytechnic University of Turin,\nthe device consists of a floating, boat-shaped hull that is slack-moored to the\nsea bed. Internally, a gyroscopic power take off (PTO) unit converts the\nwave-induced pitch motion of the hull into electrical energy. The CFD model is\nbased on the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and utilizes the fictitious\ndomain Brinkman penalization technique to couple the device physics and water\nwave dynamics. A numerical wave tank is used to emulate realistic sea operating\nconditions. A Froude scaling analysis is performed to enable two- and\nthree-dimensional simulations for a scaled-down (1:20) ISWEC model. It is\ndemonstrated that the scaled-down 2D model is sufficient to accurately simulate\nthe hull's pitching motion and to predict the power generation capability of\nthe converter. A systematic parameter study of the ISWEC is conducted, and its\noptimal performance in terms of power generation is determined based on the\nhull and gyroscope control parameters. It is demonstrated that the device\nachieves peak performance when the gyroscope specifications are chosen based on\nreactive control theory. It is shown that a proportional control of the PTO\ncontrol torque is required to generate continuous gyroscope precession effects,\nwithout which the device generates no power. In an inertial reference frame, it\nis demonstrated that the yaw and pitch torques acting on the hull are of the\nsame order of magnitude, informing future design investigations of the ISWEC\ntechnology. Further, an energy transfer pathway from the water waves to the\nhull, the hull to the gyroscope, and the gyroscope to the PTO unit is\nanalytically described and numerically verified.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 May 2020 01:42:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-28"}

The static friction coefficient is a macroscopic measure of the\napplied force at this particular instant when the frictional interface loses\nstability. However, experimental studies are known to present important scatter\nin the measurement of static friction; the origin of which remains unexplained.\nHere, we study the nucleation of local slip at interfaces with slip-weakening\nfriction of random strength and analyze the resulting variability in the\nmeasured global strength. Using numerical simulations that solve the\nelastodynamic equations, we observe that multiple slip patches nucleate\nsimultaneously, many of which are stable and grow only slowly, but one reaches\na critical length and starts propagating dynamically. We show that a\ntheoretical criterion based on a static equilibrium solution predicts\nquantitatively well the onset of frictional sliding.

The results demonstrate that an\nincreasing spatial correlation length on the interface, representing geometric\nimperfections and roughness, causes lower global static friction. Conversely,\nsmaller correlation length increases the macroscopic strength while its\nvariability decreases. We further show that randomness in local friction\nproperties is insufficient for the existence of systematic precursory slip\nevents.

While weak-supervision techniques\nhave circumvented this bottleneck, existing frameworks either require users to\nwrite a set of diverse, high-quality rules to label data (e.g., Snorkel), or\nrequire a labeled subset of the data to automatically mine rules (e.g., Snuba).\nThe process of manually writing rules can be tedious and time consuming. At the\nsame time, creating a labeled subset of the data can be costly and even\ninfeasible in imbalanced settings. This is due to the fact that a random sample\nin imbalanced settings often contains only a few positive instances.\n  To address these shortcomings, we present Darwin, an interactive system\ndesigned to alleviate the task of writing rules for labeling text data in\nweakly-supervised settings. Given an initial labeling rule, Darwin\nautomatically generates a set of candidate rules for the labeling task at hand,\nand utilizes the annotator's feedback to adapt the candidate rules. We describe\nhow Darwin is scalable and versatile. It can operate over large text corpora\n(i.e., more than 1 million sentences) and supports a wide range of labeling\nfunctions (i.e., any function that can be specified using a context free\ngrammar). Finally, we demonstrate with a suite of experiments over five\nreal-world datasets that Darwin enables annotators to generate\nweakly-supervised labels efficiently and with a small cost. In fact, our\nexperiments show that rules discovered by Darwin on average identify 40% more\npositive instances compared to Snuba even when it is provided with 1000 labeled\ninstances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 May 2020 03:29:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-14"}

To address this\nproblem, we propose to account for the differences between rural and urban\nsettings using network-based, distributed models where the spread of the\npandemic is described in distinct local cohorts with nested SEIR models.

Moreover, the probability that the virus spreads into an\nuninfected community is associated with influx of individuals from other\ncommunities where the infection is present. To account for these important\naspects, each node of the network is characterized by the frequency of contact\nbetween its members and by its level of connectivity with other nodes.

At each time\nstep, the optimal decision is obtained by conducting Monte-Carlo tree search\n(MCTS) with a learned model and solving an optimal power flow sub-problem.

Ideally, in a properly designed system, the used\nanalog to digital converter (ADC) should not limit the system performance.\nHowever, despite recent improvements in ADC technology, quite often this is not\npossible and the choice of the ADC influences significantly or even restricts\nthe system performance. It is therefore very important to estimate the\nrequirements for the analog to digital conversion at an early stage of the\nsystem design and evaluate whether one can find an adequate ADC fulfilling the\nsystem specification. In case of beam instrumentation systems requiring both,\nhigh time and amplitude resolution, it often happens that the system\nspecification cannot be met with the available ADCs without applying special\nprocessing to the analog signals prior to their digitisation. In such cases the\nrequirements for the ADC even influence the system architecture. This paper\naims at helping the designer of a beam instrumentation system in the process of\nselecting an ADC, which in many cases is iterative, requiring a trade off\nbetween system performance, complexity and cost. Analog to digital conversion\nis widely and well described in the literature, therefore this paper focusses\nmostly on aspects related to beam instrumentation.

Besides, the continuous\nproliferation of satellite images necessitates the classifiers to adapt to\ncontinuously increasing data. We propose a novel approach, coined DAugNet, for\nunsupervised, multi-source, multi-target, and life-long domain adaptation of\nsatellite images. It consists of a classifier and a data augmentor. The data\naugmentor, which is a shallow network, is able to perform style transfer\nbetween multiple satellite images in an unsupervised manner, even when new data\nare added over the time. In each training iteration, it provides the classifier\nwith diversified data, which makes the classifier robust to large data\ndistribution difference between the domains. Our extensive experiments prove\nthat DAugNet significantly better generalizes to new geographic locations than\nthe existing approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 May 2020 09:11:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 7 Jun 2020 11:48:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-24"}

Whereas melting\nprocesses in passive systems are typically triggered by external heat\ninjection, active matter crystals can self-assemble and melt into an active\nfluid by virtue of their intrinsic motility and inherent non-equilibrium\nstresses. Emergent crystal-like order has been observed in recent experiments\non suspensions of swimming sperm cells, fast-moving bacteria, Janus colloids,\nand in embryonic tissues. Yet, despite recent progress in the theoretical\ndescription of such systems, the non-equilibrium physics of active\ncrystallization and melting processes is not well understood. Here, we\nestablish the emergence and investigate the melting of self-organized vortex\ncrystals in 2D active fluids using an experimentally validated generalized\nToner-Tu theory. Performing hydrodynamic simulations at an unprecedented scale,\nwe identify two distinctly different melting scenarios: a hysteretic\ndiscontinuous phase transition and melting through an intermediary hexatic\nphase, both of which can be controlled by self-propulsion and active stresses.\nOur analysis further reveals intriguing transient features of active vortex\ncrystals including meta-stable superstructures of opposite spin polarity.\nGenerally, these results highlight the differences and similarities between\ncrystalline phases in active fluids and their equilibrium counterparts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 May 2020 09:14:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-27"}

However, recently warnings have been issued\nby multiple international professional societies against these plumbing\nsolutions as it can seriously harm the patients.\n  Methods: We have bifurcated the inspiratory and expiratory conduits from a\nsingle ventilator with addition of one way valves, pressure and flow sensors\nalong with volume and PEEP control. A purpose-built software and a low-cost\nmicrocontroller based control system integrates and displays the data in the\nfamiliar ventilatory graphic and numerical format onto a generic screen. The\nsystem is calibrated with simulated lungs with varying compliance. In addition\nto the standard microbial, heat and moisture exchanger filters we design to add\nUV-C lights at 254-260 nanometre wavelength in the expiratory channel for its\nvirucidal effect.\n  Results: The dynamic ventilatory divider system is capable of providing and\ncontrolling individual flow, tidal volume (TV) and Positive End-expiratory\npressure (PEEP) for individual patients. Furthermore, it would also display the\nventilatory parameters of both the patients, on a single split screen, in a\nfamiliar format. FiO2 and rate are still controlled by the mother ventilator.\n  Conclusions: The prototype system has a potential to provide safe ventilation\nto at least two individuals from a single ventilator, while maintaining the\nunique requirements of each patient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 May 2020 11:12:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-14"}

The state space is common across the\narms, and the arms are independent of each other. The transition probability\nmatrix of one of the arms (the odd arm) is different from the common transition\nprobability matrix of all the other arms. A decision maker, who knows these\ntransition probability matrices, wishes to identify the odd arm as quickly as\npossible, while keeping the probability of decision error small. To do so, the\ndecision maker collects observations from the arms by pulling the arms in a\nsequential manner, one at each discrete time instant. However, the decision\nmaker has a trembling hand, and the arm that is actually pulled at any given\ntime differs, with a small probability, from the one he intended to pull. The\nobservation at any given time is the arm that is actually pulled and its\ncurrent state. The Markov processes of the unobserved arms continue to evolve.\nThis makes the arms restless.\n  For the above setting, we derive the first known asymptotic lower bound on\nthe expected time required to identify the odd arm, where the asymptotics is of\nvanishing error probability. The continued evolution of each arm adds a new\ndimension to the problem, leading to a family of Markov decision problems\n(MDPs) on a countable state space. We then stitch together certain\nparameterised solutions to these MDPs and obtain a sequence of strategies whose\nexpected times to identify the odd arm come arbitrarily close to the lower\nbound in the regime of vanishing error probability.

This framework combines Kalman-Bucy\nfilters for the estimation of hidden states with Linear Quadratic Regulators\nfor the control of their dynamics. Nowadays, LQG is also a common paradigm in\nneuroscience, where it is used to characterise different approaches to\nsensorimotor control based on state estimators, forward and inverse models.\nAccording to this paradigm, perception can be seen as a process of Bayesian\ninference and action as a process of optimal control. Recently, active\ninference has been introduced as a process theory derived from a variational\napproximation of Bayesian inference problems that describes, among others,\nperception and action in terms of (variational and expected) free energy\nminimisation. Active inference relies on a mathematical formalism similar to\nLQG, but offers a rather different perspective on problems of sensorimotor\ncontrol in biological systems based on a process of biased perception. In this\nnote we compare the mathematical treatments of these two frameworks for linear\nsystems, focusing on their respective assumptions and highlighting their\ncommonalities and technical differences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 May 2020 12:14:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-14"}

This optimization can be used for\nvarious purposes: to prevent overfitting, to save resources for implementation\nand training, to provide explainability of the trained NN, and many others. The\nminimal structure that cannot be pruned further is not unique. Ensemble of\nminimal structures can be used as a committee of intellectual agents that\nsolves problems by voting. Each minimal NN presents an \"empirical knowledge\"\nabout the problem and can be verbalized. The non-uniqueness of such knowledge\nextracted from data is an important property of data-driven Artificial\nIntelligence (AI). In this work, we review an approach to pruning based on the\nprinciple: What controls training should control pruning. This principle is\nexpected to work both for artificial NN and for selection and modification of\nimportant synaptic contacts in brain. In back-propagation artificial NN\nlearning is controlled by the gradient of loss functions. Therefore, the first\norder sensitivity indicators are used for pruning and the algorithms based on\nthese indicators are reviewed. The notion of logically transparent NN was\nintroduced. The approach was illustrated on the problem of political\nforecasting: predicting the results of the US presidential election. Eight\nminimal NN were produced that give different forecasting algorithms. The\nnon-uniqueness of solution can be utilised by creation of expert panels\n(committee).

The\napproach is threefold. First, we train strong baseline binary networks with a\nwide range of random group combinations at each convolutional layer. This\nset-up gives the binary neural networks a capability of preserving essential\ninformation through layers.

Our\nfocus is how the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of these $L^*$ star-forming\ngalaxies change over the last 10 Gyr. We find that the high-$z$ CGM is almost\nequally divided between the \"cool\" ($T<10^5$ K) and \"hot\" ($T\\geq 10^5$ K)\nphases, while the low-$z$ hot CGM phase contains $5\\times$ more mass. The\nhigh-$z$ hot CGM contains 60% more metals than the cool CGM, while the low-$z$\ncool CGM contains 35% more metals than the hot CGM content. The metals are\nevenly distributed radially between the hot and cool phases throughout the\nhigh-$z$ CGM. At high $z$, the CGM volume is dominated by hot outflows, cool\ngas is mainly inflowing, but cool metals are flowing outward. At low $z$, the\ncool metals dominate the interior and the hot metals are more prevalent at\nlarger radii. The low-$z$ cool CGM has tangential motions consistent with\nrotational support out to $0.2 R_{200}$, often exhibiting $r \\approx 40$ kpc\ndisc-like structures.

Of particular importance are the Ranking algorithm for integral matching\nand the Water-filling algorithm for fractional matching. Most algorithms in the\nliterature can be viewed as adaptations of these two in the corresponding\nmodels. Recently, Huang et al.~(STOC 2018, SODA 2019) introduced a more general\nmodel called \\emph{fully online matching}, which considers general graphs and\nallows all vertices to arrive online. They also generalized Ranking and\nWater-filling to fully online matching and gave some tight analysis: Ranking is\n$\\Omega \\approx 0.567$-competitive on bipartite graphs where the\n$\\Omega$-constant satisfies $\\Omega e^\\Omega = 1$, and Water-filling is\n$2-\\sqrt{2} \\approx 0.585$-competitive on general graphs.\n  We propose fully online matching algorithms strictly better than Ranking and\nWater-filling. For integral matching on bipartite graphs, we build on the\nonline primal dual analysis of Ranking and Water-filling to design a\n$0.569$-competitive hybrid algorithm called Balanced Ranking. To our knowledge,\nit is the first integral algorithm in the online matching literature that\nsuccessfully integrates ideas from Water-filling. For fractional matching on\ngeneral graphs, we give a $0.592$-competitive algorithm called Eager\nWater-filling, which may match a vertex on its arrival. By contrast, the\noriginal Water-filling algorithm always matches vertices at their deadlines.\nOur result for fractional matching further shows a separation between fully\nonline matching and the general vertex arrival model by Wang and Wong (ICALP\n2015), due to an upper bound of $0.5914$ in the latter model by Buchbinder,\nSegev, and Tkach (ESA 2017).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 May 2020 13:33:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-14"}

The basic notions of quasiperiodicity are\ncover and seed. A cover of a text $T$ is a string whose occurrences in $T$\ncover all positions of $T$. A seed of text $T$ is a cover of a superstring of\n$T$. In various applications exact quasiperiodicity is still not sufficient due\nto the presence of errors. We consider approximate notions of quasiperiodicity,\nfor which we allow approximate occurrences in $T$ with a small Hamming,\nLevenshtein or weighted edit distance.\n  In previous work Sip et al. (2002) and Christodoulakis et al. (2005) showed\nthat computing approximate covers and seeds, respectively, under weighted edit\ndistance is NP-hard. They, therefore, considered restricted approximate covers\nand seeds which need to be factors of the original string $T$ and presented\npolynomial-time algorithms for computing them. Further algorithms, considering\napproximate occurrences with Hamming distance bounded by $k$, were given in\nseveral contributions by Guth et al. They also studied relaxed approximate\nquasiperiods that do not need to cover all positions of $T$.\n  In case of large data the exponents in polynomial time complexity play a\ncrucial role. We present more efficient algorithms for computing restricted\napproximate covers and seeds. In particular, we improve upon the complexities\nof many of the aforementioned algorithms, also for relaxed quasiperiods. Our\nsolutions are especially efficient if the number (or total cost) of allowed\nerrors is bounded. We also show NP-hardness of computing non-restricted\napproximate covers and seeds under Hamming distance.\n  Approximate covers were studied in three recent contributions at CPM over the\nlast three years. However, these works consider a different definition of an\napproximate cover of $T$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 May 2020 13:58:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-14"}

It is well known that radial polarised light produces a\nlongitudinal polarisation component and can be focused below the conventional\ndiffraction limit for homogeneously polarised light, and azimuthally polarised\nlight that carries one unit of angular momentum can achieve even tighter focal\nspots. This is of interest for example for enhancing resolution in scanning\nmicroscopy. There are numerous ways to generate such polarisation structures,\nhowever, setups can be expensive and usually rely on birefringent components,\nhence prohibiting broadband operation. We have recently demonstrated a passive,\nlow-cost technique using a simple glass cone (Fresnel cone) to generate beams\nwith structured polarisation. We show here that the polarisation structure\ngenerated by Fresnel cones focuses better than radial polarised light at all\nnumerical apertures.

However, despite\ndecades of theoretical and observational efforts, the physical mechanism(s)\nresponsible for irradiating these discs remains largely unknown. We have built\nan observationally-based methodology to estimate the strength of irradiation of\nBHXB discs by combining multiwavelength X-ray and optical/IR data throughout\ntransient outbursts. We apply this to $\\sim15$ yrs of activity in the Galactic\nBHXB GX339$-$4. Our findings suggest that the irradiation heating required by\nthe optical data is large in this system. Direct illumination of the outer disc\ndoes not produce sufficient irradiation, but this should also produce a\nthermal-radiative wind which adds to the irradiation heating by scattering flux\ndown onto the disc. However, analytic estimates of X-ray illumination from\nscattering in the wind is still not sufficient to produce the observed heating,\neven in combination with direct illumination. Either the analytic\nthermal-radiative wind models are underestimating the effect of the wind, or\nthere are additional scattering mechanisms at work, such as magnetically-driven\noutflows, acting to increase the optical/IR flux. While wind-driven irradiation\nis likely a common feature among long-period BHXBs, fully understanding the\ndriving mechanism(s) behind such a wind will require radiation-hydrodynamic\nsimulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 May 2020 15:41:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-27"}

To address\nthis problem, this paper designs a novel end-to-end semantic segmentation\nnetwork, namely Super-Resolution Domain Adaptation Network (SRDA-Net).

We developed a method to generate a modified sinogram which resolves the\nblocking problem.

We generated the modified\nsinogram for about one month in 2019 February and reconstructed the\nthree-dimensional corona under the static state assumption. In order to obtain\nthe physical parameters of the corona, we employed a DEM inversion method. We\ntested the performance of the FBP algorithm with the modified sinogram by\ncomparing the reconstructed data with the observed EUV image, electron density\nmodels, previous studies of electron temperature, and an observed coronagraph\nimage. The results illustrate that the FBP algorithm reasonably reconstructs\nthe bright regions and the coronal holes, and can reproduce their physical\nparameters.

To deal with such attacks, we propose an intelligent\ndeception strategy which allows the legitimate transmitter to transmit \"fake\"\nsignals to attract the jammer. Then, if the jammer attacks the channel, the\ntransmitter can leverage the strong jamming signals to transmit data by using\nambient backscatter communication technology or harvest energy from the strong\njamming signals for future use. By doing so, we can not only undermine the\nattack ability of the jammer, but also utilize jamming signals to improve the\nsystem performance.

In absence of any vaccine or therapeutics, forecasting is of utmost\npriority for health care planning and control the transmission of COVID-19.\n  Methods: We have proposed a mathematical model that explain the transmission\ndynamics of COVID-19 in India.

In the\nGathering problem, a set of initially scattered robots is required to gather at\nthe same position. The robots' capabilities are very restricted -- they do not\nagree on any coordinate system or compass, have a limited viewing range, have\nno memory of the past and cannot communicate. We study the problem in two\ndifferent time models, in FSYNC (fully synchronized discrete rounds) and the\ncontinuous time model. For FSYNC, we introduce the 3D-Go-To-The-Center-strategy\nand prove a runtime of $\\Theta(n^2)$ that matches the currently best runtime\nbound for the same model in the Euclidean plane [SPAA'11]. Our main result is\nthe generalization of contracting strategies (continuous time) from\n[Algosensors'17] to three dimensions. In contracting strategies, every robot\nthat is located on the global convex hull of all robots' positions moves with\nfull speed towards the inside of the convex hull. We prove a runtime bound of\n$O(\\Delta \\cdot n^{3/2})$ for any three-dimensional contracting strategy, where\n$\\Delta$ denotes the diameter of the initial configuration. This comes up to a\nfactor of $\\sqrt{n}$ close to the lower bound of $\\Omega (\\Delta \\cdot n)$\nwhich is already true in two dimensions. In general, it might be hard for\nrobots with limited viewing range to decide whether they are located on the\nglobal convex hull and which movement maintains the connectivity of the swarm,\nrendering the design of concrete contracting strategies a challenging task. We\nprove that the continuous variant of 3D-Go-To-The-Center is contracting and\nkeeps the swarm connected. Moreover, we give a simple design criterion for\nthree-dimensional contracting strategies that maintains the connectivity of the\nswarm and introduce an exemplary strategy based on this criterion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 May 2020 10:55:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-18"}

Devices are now more personal than ever and carry more information\nabout a person than any other. Extracting user behaviour is rather difficult\nand time-consuming as most of the work previously has been manual or requires\nfeature extraction. In this paper, a novel approach of user behavior detection\nis proposed with Deep Learning Network (DNN). Initial approach was to use\nrecurrent neural network (RNN) along with LSTM for completely unsupervised\nanalysis of mobile devices. Next approach is to extract features by using Long\nShort Term Memory (LSTM) to understand the user behaviour, which are then fed\ninto the Convolution Neural Network (CNN). This work mainly concentrates on\ndetection of user behaviour and anomaly detection for usage analysis of mobile\ndevices. Both the approaches are compared against some baseline methods.\nExperiments are conducted on the publicly available dataset to show that these\nmethods can successfully capture the user behaviors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 13 May 2020 12:15:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-26"}
