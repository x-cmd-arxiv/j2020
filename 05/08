A moderate helical density makes the chiral phase\ntransition softer while shifting the critical endpoint towards lower\ntemperatures and higher baryon chemical potentials. As the helical density\nincreases, the segment of the first-order transition disappears, and the chiral\ntransition becomes a soft crossover. At even higher helical chemical\npotentials, the first-order transition reappears again at the zero-density\nfinite-temperature transition and extends into the interior of the phase\ndiagram.

In this paper, we characterize the nature of the outbursts\noccurring in these simulations. The instability in the dead zone of a typical\nlayered disk results in \"MRI outbursts\". We explore their progression and their\ndependence on the layered disk parameters as well as cloud core mass. The\nsimulations of fully MRI-active disks showed an instability analogous to the\nclassical thermal instability. This instability manifested at two\ntemperatures--above approximately 1400 K and 3500 K--due to the steep\ndependence of Rosseland opacity on the temperature. The origin of these\nthermally unstable regions is related to the bump in opacity resulting from\nmolecular absorption by water vapor and may be viewed as a novel mechanism\nbehind some of the shorter duration accretion events. Although we demonstrated\nlocal thermal instability in the disk, more investigations are needed to\nconfirm that a large-scale global instability will ensue.

The problem is to keep the electroweak scale stable\nwhile providing a room for the aforementioned heavy extensions.

Their unique canonical forms, providing such quantum mechanical\nobservables, are characterised by having only logarithmic singularities along\nall the boundaries of the positive geometry. However, physical observables have\nlogarithmic singularities just for a subset of theories. Thus, it becomes\ncrucial to understand whether a similar paradigm can underlie their structure\nin more general cases. In this paper we start a systematic investigation of a\ngeometric-combinatorial characterisation of differential forms with\nnon-logarithmic singularities, focusing on projective polytopes and related\nmeromorphic forms with multiple poles. We introduce the notions of covariant\nforms and covariant pairings. Covariant forms have poles only along the\nboundaries of the given polytope; moreover, their leading Laurent coefficients\nalong any of the boundaries are still covariant forms on the specific boundary.\nWhereas meromorphic forms in covariant pairing with a polytope are associated\nto a specific (signed) triangulation, in which poles on spurious boundaries do\nnot cancel completely, but their order is lowered. These meromorphic forms can\nbe fully characterised if the polytope they are associated to is viewed as the\nrestriction of a higher dimensional one onto a hyperplane. The canonical form\nof the latter can be mapped into a covariant form or a form in covariant\npairing via a covariant restriction. We show how the geometry of the higher\ndimensional polytope determines the structure of these differential forms.\nFinally, we discuss how these notions are related to Jeffrey-Kirwan residues\nand cosmological polytopes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 May 2020 17:10:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

Our modeling, based\non the data from the two dozen space- and ground-based instruments that\nfollowed GRB 190114C at multiple wavelengths, supports the explanation that the\nsecond peak is due to the Inverse Compton radiation mechanism. The two-peaked\nstructure of the spectral energy distribution allows us to constrain some of\nthe key physical parameters of the GRB as the bulk Lorentz factor, minimal\nelectron energy, the ratio of the radiation to magnetic field density. Recently\nalso the H.E.S.S. imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope reported on a 5 sigma\ngamma-ray signal from the GRB 180720B, measured in the afterglow phase, 10\nhours after the onset of the explosion. These observations prove that the GRBs\nare more powerful than assumed until recently. Because the observed GRBs did\nnot show peculiar properties, we believe that from now on detection of\ngamma-ray signal from GRB afterglows at very high energies will become one of\nthe standard observations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 May 2020 17:45:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-08"}

Traditional anti-virus software are\nineffective against modern complex Malware. In order to address this challenge,\nresearchers have proposed Hardware-assisted Malware Detection (HMD) using\nHardware Performance Counters (HPCs). The HPCs are used to train a set of\nMachine learning (ML) classifiers, which in turn, are used to distinguish\nbenign programs from Malware. Recently, adversarial attacks have been designed\nby introducing perturbations in the HPC traces using an adversarial sample\npredictor to misclassify a program for specific HPCs. These attacks are\ndesigned with the basic assumption that the attacker is aware of the HPCs being\nused to detect Malware. Since modern processors consist of hundreds of HPCs,\nrestricting to only a few of them for Malware detection aids the attacker. In\nthis paper, we propose a Moving target defense (MTD) for this adversarial\nattack by designing multiple ML classifiers trained on different sets of HPCs.\nThe MTD randomly selects a classifier; thus, confusing the attacker about the\nHPCs or the number of classifiers applied. We have developed an analytical\nmodel which proves that the probability of an attacker to guess the perfect\nHPC-classifier combination for MTD is extremely low (in the range of\n$10^{-1864}$ for a system with 20 HPCs).

We discovered that point cloud models require less memory and are\nfaster both in training and inference compared to traditional CNN 3D, they\nachieve better performance and do not impose restrictions on the size of the\ninput image, i.e. no restrictions on the size of the nodule candidate.

In particular,\nboth the epochs of reionization and cosmic dawn remain largely uncharted, and\nthe 21-cm signal is one of the few probes to reach them. The simplest 21-cm\nmeasurement is the global signal (GS), which corresponds to the averaged\nabsorption or emission of 21-cm photons across the entire sky. While bright\nradio foregrounds swamp the cosmic signal over the entire frequency range\nobservable, presenting a formidable hurdle, they can in principle be\nsubtracted, given enough sensitivity. Here, however, we point out an\nadditional---and irreducible---source of uncertainty for the 21-cm GS: cosmic\nvariance. The cosmic-variance noise arises from the finite volume of the\nuniverse accessible to 21-cm experiments. Due to the cosmological redshifting\nof 21-cm photons, each observed frequency probes our universe during a\nparticular cosmic age, corresponding to a narrow redshift slice. The presence\nof large 21-cm fluctuations makes the GS within each slice different than the\nGS averaged over the entire universe. We estimate the size of this\ncosmic-variance noise, and find that for a standard scenario it has a size of\n$\\sim 0.1$ mK, which is $\\sim 10\\%$ of the size of the expected instrumental\nnoise of a year-long experiment. Interestingly, cosmic variance can overtake\ninstrumental noise for scenarios with extreme 21-cm fluctuations, such as those\nsuggested to explain the sharpness of the claimed EDGES detection. Moreover, as\nlarge-scale 21-cm fluctuations are coherent over long distances, cosmic\nvariance correlates the measurements of the GS at nearby redshifts, leading to\noff-diagonal uncertainties that have so far been neglected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 May 2020 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-13"}

These \"snow-lines\" can play vital roles in planet formation at\nall scales, from dust coagulation to planetary migration. In the outer regions\nof protoplanetary discs, the temperature profile is set by the absorption of\nreprocessed stellar light by the solids. Further, the temperature profile sets\nthe distribution of solids through sublimation and condensation at various\nsnow-lines. Hence the snow-line position depends on the temperature profile and\nvice-versa. We show that this coupling can be thermally unstable, such that a\npatch of the disc at a snow-line will produce either run-away sublimation or\ncondensation. This thermal instability arises at moderate optical depths, where\nheating by absorption of reprocessed stellar light from the disc's atmosphere\nis optically thick, yet cooling is optically thin. Since volatiles in the solid\nphase drift much faster than volatiles in the vapour phase, this thermal\ninstability results in a limit-cycle. The snow-line progressively moves in,\ncondensing volatiles, before receding, as the volatiles sublimate. Using\nnumerical simulations, we study the evolution of the CO snow-line.

Nearly all\nprevious simulations of terrestrial planet formation assume that Moon to Mars\nmassed embryos formed throughout the inner solar system during the primordial\ngas-disk phase. However, validating this assumption through models of embryo\naccretion is computationally challenging because of the large number of bodies\nrequired.

We pose the question\nof whether this is always the case in the context of quantum field theory in\n$d$ space dimensions. More concretely, one can ask whether there exist critical\npoints (CFTs) which break some global symmetry at arbitrary finite temperature.\nThe most familiar CFTs do not exhibit symmetry breaking at finite temperature,\nand moreover, in the context of the AdS/CFT correspondence, critical points at\nfinite temperature are described by an uncharged black brane which obeys a\nno-hair theorem. Yet, we show that there exist CFTs which have some of their\ninternal symmetries broken at arbitrary finite temperature. Our main example is\na vector model which we study both in the epsilon expansion and arbitrary rank\nas well as the large rank limit (and arbitrary dimension). The large rank limit\nof the vector model displays a conformal manifold, a moduli space of vacua, and\na deformed moduli space of vacua at finite temperature. The appropriate\nNambu-Goldstone bosons including the dilaton-like particle are identified.\nUsing these tools we establish symmetry breaking at finite temperature for\nfinite small $\\epsilon$. We also prove that a large class of other fixed\npoints, which describe some of the most common quantum magnets, indeed behave\nas expected and do not break any global symmetry at finite temperature. We\ndiscuss some of the consequences of finite temperature symmetry breaking for\nthe spectrum of local operators.

The state-of-the art procedure for\nestimating arterial TTD commonly assumes that the path travel time follows a\ncertain distribution without considering segment correlation. However, this\napproach is usually unrealistic as travel times on successive segments may be\ndependent. In this study, copula functions are used to model arterial TTD as\ncopulas are able to incorporate for segment correlation. First, segment\ncorrelation is empirically investigated using day-to-day GPS data provided by\nBMW Group for one major urban arterial in Munich, Germany. Segment TTDs are\nestimated using a finite Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). Next, several copula\nmodels are introduced, namely Gaussian, Student-t, Clayton, and Gumbel, to\nmodel the dependent structure between segment TTDs. The parameters of each\ncopula model are obtained by Maximum Log Likelihood Estimation. Then, path TTDs\ncomprised of consecutive segment TTDs are estimated based on the copula models.\nThe scalability of the model is evaluated by investigating the performance for\nan increasing number of aggregated links. The best fitting copula is determined\nin terms of goodness-of-fit test. The results demonstrate the advantage of the\nproposed copula model for an increasing number of aggregated segments, compared\nto the convolution without incorporating segment correlations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 May 2020 18:48:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-11"}

As part of the project SAGAN, we have created a database of all\nknown GRGs, the GRG catalogue, from the literature (including our new sample);\nit includes 820 sources. For the first time, we present the multi-wavelength\nproperties of the largest sample of GRGs. Our results establish that the\ndistributions of the radio spectral index and the black hole mass of GRGs do\nnot differ from the corresponding distributions of normal-sized radio galaxies\n(RGs). However, GRGs have a lower Eddington ratio (ER) than RGs. Using the\nmid-infrared data, we classified GRGs in terms of their accretion mode: either\na high-power radiatively efficient high-excitation state, or a radiatively\ninefficient low-excitation state. We find that GRGs in high-excitation state\nstatistically have larger sizes, stronger radio power, jet kinetic power, and\nhigher ER than those in low-excitation state. Our analysis reveals a strong\ncorrelation between the ER and the scaled jet kinetic power, which suggests a\ndisc-jet coupling.

Three-dimensional\ncomputational fluid dynamics (CFD) approaches resolve of the flow fields on\nfiner spatial and temporal scales, which can complement dedicated experimental\nstudy. However, closures must be introduced to reflect the underlying physics\nin multiphase flow.

We use high-resolution\nlocal simulations in an unstratified disk to assess the accuracy and domain of\napplicability of the linear theory.

In the high thermal conductivity regime linear theory\nunderpredicts the acceleration, although here both non-linear and computational\nconstraints play a role.

Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have\nachieved advancement in various real-world applications, such as image editing,\nstyle transfer, scene generations, etc. However, like other deep learning\nmodels, GANs are also suffering from data limitation problems in real cases. To\nboost the performance of GANs in target tasks, collecting images as many as\npossible from different sources becomes not only important but also essential.\nFor example, to build a robust and accurate bio-metric verification system,\nhuge amounts of images might be collected from surveillance cameras, and/or\nuploaded from cellphones by users accepting agreements. In an ideal case,\nutilize all those data uploaded from public and private devices for model\ntraining is straightforward. Unfortunately, in the real scenarios, this is hard\ndue to a few reasons. At first, some data face the serious concern of leakage,\nand therefore it is prohibitive to upload them to a third-party server for\nmodel training; at second, the images collected by different kinds of devices,\nprobably have distinctive biases due to various factors, $\\textit{e.g.}$,\ncollector preferences, geo-location differences, which is also known as \"domain\nshift\". To handle those problems, we propose a novel generative learning scheme\nutilizing a federated learning framework. Following the configuration of\nfederated learning, we conduct model training and aggregation on one center and\na group of clients. Specifically, our method learns the distributed generative\nmodels in clients, while the models trained in each client are fused into one\nunified and versatile model in the center. We perform extensive experiments to\ncompare different federation strategies, and empirically examine the\neffectiveness of federation under different levels of parallelism and data\nskewness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 May 2020 23:06:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 24 May 2020 14:35:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 19 Jul 2020 05:02:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-21"}

The rhomag0 and A values obtained from the\nlow-temperature electrical resistivity based on the Fermi liquid relation of\nrhomag = rhomag0 + AT^2 exhibit huge and sharp peaks around Pc. The exponent n\nobtained from the power law dependence rhomag = rhomag0 + BT^n is clearly less\nthan 1.5 at P = Pc = 6. 5 GPa, which is expected at the AF-QCP.

When the radial component of the\nspeed of a muon toward a PMT drops from superluminal to subluminal, the PMT\nwill record Cherenkov light from a little-known optical phenomenon called\nRelativistic Image Doubling (RID).

In this paper, we propose Projection &\nProbability-driven Black-box Attack (PPBA) to tackle this problem by reducing\nthe solution space and providing better optimization. For reducing the solution\nspace, we first model the adversarial perturbation optimization problem as a\nprocess of recovering frequency-sparse perturbations with compressed sensing,\nunder the setting that random noise in the low-frequency space is more likely\nto be adversarial. We then propose a simple method to construct a low-frequency\nconstrained sensing matrix, which works as a plug-and-play projection matrix to\nreduce the dimensionality. Such a sensing matrix is shown to be flexible enough\nto be integrated into existing methods like NES and Bandits$_{TD}$. For better\noptimization, we perform a random walk with a probability-driven strategy,\nwhich utilizes all queries over the whole progress to make full use of the\nsensing matrix for a less query budget. Extensive experiments show that our\nmethod requires at most 24% fewer queries with a higher attack success rate\ncompared with state-of-the-art approaches.

Second, we present a co-designed hardware\narchitecture that also reduces computation. Uniquely, the GOBO architecture\nmaintains most of the weights in 3b even during computation, a property that:\n(1) makes the processing elements area efficient, allowing us to pack more\ncompute power per unit area, (2) replaces most multiply-accumulations with\nadditions, and (3) reduces the off-chip traffic by amplifying on-chip memory\ncapacity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 May 2020 03:59:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 27 Sep 2020 00:09:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-25"}

In pursue of these\ngoals, Chile has implemented a $5 per tonne of CO2 emission tax, first of its\nkind in Latin America. However, such a low price has proven to be insufficient.\nIn our work, we study an alternative approach for capping and pricing carbon\nemissions in the Chilean electric sector; the cap and trade paradigm. We model\nthe Chilean electric market (generators and emissions auctioneer) as a two\nstage capacity expansion equilibrium problem, where we allow future investment\nand trading of emission permits among generator agents. The model studies\ngeneration and future investments in the Chilean electric sector in two regimes\nof demand: deterministic and stochastic. We show that the current Chilean\nGreenhouse Gases (GHG) intensity pledge does not drive an important shift in\nthe future Chilean electric matrix. To encourage a shift to greener\ntechnologies, a more stringent carbon budget must be considered, resulting in a\ncarbon price approximately ten times higher than the present one. We also show\nthat achieving the emissions reduction goal does not necessarily results in\nfurther reductions of carbon generation, or phasing out coal in the longer\nterm. Finally, we demonstrate that under technology change costs reductions,\nhigher demand scenarios will relax the need for stringent carbon budgets to\nachieve new renewable energy investments and hence meet the Chilean pledges.\nThese results suggest that some aspects of the Chilean pledge require further\nanalysis, of the economic impact, particularly with the recent announcement of\nachieving carbon neutrality towards 2050.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 May 2020 04:01:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-23"}

This paper\nfocuses on the synergy of multilingual lip reading. There are about as many as\n7000 languages in the world, which implies that it is impractical to train\nseparate lip reading models with large-scale data for each language. Although\neach language has its own linguistic and pronunciation rules, the lip movements\nof all languages share similar patterns due to the common structures of human\norgans. Based on this idea, we try to explore the synergized learning of\nmultilingual lip reading in this paper, and further propose a synchronous\nbidirectional learning (SBL) framework for effective synergy of multilingual\nlip reading. We firstly introduce phonemes as our modeling units for the\nmultilingual setting here. Phonemes are more closely related with the lip\nmovements than the alphabet letters. At the same time, similar phonemes always\nlead to similar visual patterns no matter which type the target language is.\nThen, a novel SBL block is proposed to learn the rules for each language in a\nfill-in-the-blank way. Specifically, the model has to learn to infer the target\nunit given its bidirectional context, which could represent the composition\nrules of phonemes for each language. To make the learning process more targeted\nat each particular language, an extra task of predicting the language identity\nis introduced in the learning process. Finally, a thorough comparison on LRW\n(English) and LRW-1000 (Mandarin) is performed, which shows the promising\nbenefits from the synergized learning of different languages and also reports a\nnew state-of-the-art result on both datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 May 2020 04:19:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 May 2020 02:45:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 12 May 2020 01:04:28 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 14 Aug 2020 15:34:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-17"}

Secondly, network ST is shown to be greatly degraded with the\nover-deployment of UAV APs due to the growing air-to-ground interference under\nexcessive overlap of UAV cells. Finally, aiming to alleviate the interference,\na projection area equivalence (PAE) rule is designed to tune the UAV beamwidth.\nEspecially, network ST can be sustainably increased with growing UAV density\nand independent of UAV flight altitude if UAV beamwidth inversely grows with\nthe square of UAV density under PAE.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 May 2020 07:11:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-11"}

In motion segmentation, the subspaces are affine and an\nadditional affine constraint on the coefficients is often enforced. However,\nsince affine subspaces can always be embedded into linear subspaces of one\nextra dimension, it is unclear if the affine constraint is really necessary.\nThis paper shows, both theoretically and empirically, that when the dimension\nof the ambient space is high relative to the sum of the dimensions of the\naffine subspaces, the affine constraint has a negligible effect on clustering\nperformance. Specifically, our analysis provides conditions that guarantee the\ncorrectness of affine subspace clustering methods both with and without the\naffine constraint, and shows that these conditions are satisfied for\nhigh-dimensional data.

Efficient functioning of such an injector is provided by\nelectrically induced magnetization precession in the \"free\" layer of MTJ, which\ngenerates the spin pumping into a metallic or semiconducting overlayer. We\ntheoretically describe the spin and charge dynamics in the\nCoFeB/MgO/CoFeB/Au(GaAs) heterostructures. First, the magnedynamics in the free\nCoFeB layer is quantified with the account of a spin-transfer torque and a\nvoltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy. By numerically solving the\nmagnetodynamics equation, we determine dependences of the precession amplitude\non the frequency $f$ and magnitude $V_\\mathrm{max}$ of the ac voltage applied\nto the MTJ. It is found that the frequency dependence changes drastically above\nthe threshold amplitude $V_\\mathrm{max} \\approx 200$mV, exhibiting a break at\nthe resonance frequency $f_\\mathrm{res}$ due to nonlinear effects. The results\nobtained for the magnetization dynamics are used to describe the spin injection\nand pumping into the Au and GaAs overlayers. Since the generated spin current\ncreates additional charge current owing to the inverse spin Hall effect, we\nalso calculate distribution of the electric potential in the thick Au\noverlayer. The calculations show that the arising transverse voltage becomes\nexperimentally measurable at $f = f_\\mathrm{res}$. Finally, we evaluate the\nspin accumulation in a long n$^+$-GaAs bar coupled to the MTJ and determine its\ntemporal variation and spatial distribution along the bar. It is found that the\nspin accumulation under resonant excitation is large enough for experimental\ndetection even at micrometer distances from the MTJ. This result demonstrates\nhigh efficiency of the described nanoscale spin injector.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 May 2020 08:05:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-16"}

The generator minimizes the spoof\ncues of live samples while imposes no explicit constraint on those of spoof\nsamples to generalize well to unseen attacks.

Although the existing methods based on convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs) have achieved the state-of-the-art performance, many\nchallenges still remain in medical tumor segmentation. This is because regular\nCNNs can only exploit translation invariance, ignoring further inherent\nsymmetries existing in medical images such as rotations and reflections. To\nmitigate this shortcoming, we propose a novel group equivariant segmentation\nframework by encoding those inherent symmetries for learning more precise\nrepresentations. First, kernel-based equivariant operations are devised on\nevery orientation, which can effectively address the gaps of learning\nsymmetries in existing approaches. Then, to keep segmentation networks globally\nequivariant, we design distinctive group layers with layerwise symmetry\nconstraints. By exploiting further symmetries, novel segmentation CNNs can\ndramatically reduce the sample complexity and the redundancy of filters (by\nroughly 2/3) over regular CNNs. More importantly, based on our novel framework,\nwe show that a newly built GER-UNet outperforms its regular CNN-based\ncounterpart and the state-of-the-art segmentation methods on real-world\nclinical data.

In the latter, only the fundamental frequency and\nthe upper and lower sidebands are retained. Plane wave solutions to the NLSE\nexhibit modulation instability (MI) within a frequency band determined by a\nlinear stability analysis. For modulation frequencies inside the MI-band, we\nexperimentally demonstrate that forcing and damping cause a separatrix crossing\nduring the evolution. Our experiments are performed on deep water waves, which\nare better described by the higher-order NLSE, the Dysthe equation. We\ntherefore extend our analysis to this system. However, our conclusions are\ngeneral. When the system is damped by the viscosity of the water, it is pulled\noutside the separatrix, which in the real space corresponds to a phase-shift of\nthe envelope and therefore doubles the period of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou\nrecurrence cycle. When the system is forced by the wind, it is pulled inside\nthe separatrix. Furthermore, for modulation frequencies outside the\nconventional MI-band, we experimentally demonstrate that contrary to the linear\nprediction, we do observe a growth and decay cycle of the plane-wave\nmodulation.

Although theoretically sound, these methods are still\nbased on simplifying assumptions and their relevance to real galaxies can be\nquestioned. In this paper, we use zoomed-in cosmological simulations to\nquantify the associated uncertainties. Assuming isotropy, we predict the speed\ndistribution and its moments from the DM and baryonic content measured in\nsimulations, and compare them with the true ones. Taking as input galactic mass\nmodels fitted on full simulation data, we reach a predictivity down to ~ 10%\nfor some velocity-related observables, significantly better than some\nMaxwellian models.

Recently, SNMR has been adapted to investigate also the shallow\nunsaturated zone with small surface loop setups. Due to the decreased volume, a\npre-polarization (PP) field prior to the classical spin excitation is applied\nto enhance the measured response signal. Depending on the strength and\norientation of the applied PP-field, the enhancement can often reach several\norders of magnitude in the vicinity of the PP-loop. The theoretically\nachievable enhancement depends on the assumption of an adiabatic, i.e. perfect,\nswitch-off of the corresponding PP-field. To study the effect of imperfect\nswitch-off, we incorporate full spin dynamics simulations into the SNMR forward\nmodeling. The affected subsurface volume strongly depends on the chosen PP\nswitch-off ramp and the geometry of the loop setup.

The main two challenges in our work\nare the existence of pistachios' occlusion and deformation of pistachios in\ndifferent frames because open-mouth pistachios that move and roll on the\ntransportation line may appear as closed-mouth in some frames and open-mouth in\nother frames.

We develop the field equations for\n$f(\\mathscr{R},\\mathscr{G})$ gravity by employing the Karmarkar condition with\na specific model already reported in literature by Lake [Phys. Rev. D 67,\n104015 (2003)]. We further consider the Schwarzschild geometry for matching\nconditions at the boundary. It is important to mention here that we calculate\nthe values of all the involved parameter by imposing the matching condition. We\nhave provided a detailed graphical analysis to discuss the physical\nacceptability of parameters, i.e., energy density, pressure, anisotropy, and\ngradients. We have also examined the stability of compacts stars by exploring\nthe energy conditions, equation of state, generalized\nTolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation, causality condition, and adiabatic index.\nFor present analysis, we predict some numerical values in tabular form for\ncentral gravitational metric functions, central density and central pressures\ncomponents. We have also calculated the ratio $p_{rc}/ \\rho_{c}$ to check the\nvalidity of Zeldovich's condition. Conclusively, it is found that our obtained\nsolutions are physically viable with well-behaved nature in\n$f(\\mathscr{R},\\mathscr{G})$ modified gravity for the compact star models under\ndiscussion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 May 2020 16:10:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-11"}

We consider\na scenario where voters may change their preference lists as a consequence of\nthe messages received by their neighbors in a social network. Specifically, we\nconsider a political campaign that spreads messages in a social network in\nsupport or against a given candidate and the spreading follows a dynamic model\nfor information diffusion. When a message reaches a voter, this latter changes\nits preference list according to an update rule. The election control problem\nasks to find a bounded set of nodes to be the starter of a political campaign\nin support (constructive problem) or against (destructive problem) a given\ntarget candidate $c$, in such a way that the margin of victory of $c$ w.r.t.\nits most voted opponents is maximized.

Four turbulent slot jet\nflames are simulated at increasing Reynolds number and up to $Re \\approx\n22000$, defined based on the bulk velocity, slot width, and the reactants'\nproperties. The turbulent flame speed $S_T$ is evaluated locally at select\nstreamwise locations and it is observed to increase both in the streamwise\ndirection for each flame and across flames for increasing Reynolds number, in\nline with a corresponding increase of the turbulent integral scale. In\nparticular, the turbulent flame speed $S_T$ increases exponentially with the\nintegral scale for $l$ up to about 6 laminar flame thicknesses, while the\nscaling becomes a power-law for larger values of $l$. These trends cannot be\nascribed completely to the increase in the flame surface, since the turbulent\nflame speed looses its proportionality to the flame area as the integral scale\nincreases; in particular, it is found that the ratio of turbulent flame speed\nto area attains a power-law scaling $l^{0.2}$. This is caused by an overall\nbroadening of the reaction layer for increasing integral scale, which is not\nassociated with a corresponding decrease of the reaction rate, causing a net\nenhancement of the overall burning rate.

This is typically done by manually\nsetting a tradeoff parameter $\\beta$, an approach called $\\beta$-VAE. Using\nthis approach it is difficult to target a specific rate or distortion value,\nbecause the result can be very sensitive to $\\beta$, and the appropriate value\nfor $\\beta$ depends on the model and problem setup. As a result, model\ncomparison requires extensive per-model $\\beta$-tuning, and producing a whole\nrate-distortion curve (by varying $\\beta$) for each model to be compared.

The cost of computing F in this model is the maximum number of bits\nexchanged in any round between Alice and Bob (on the worst case input x,y). In\nthis paper, we also consider variants of our memoryless model wherein one party\nis allowed to have memory, the parties are allowed to communicate quantum bits,\nonly one player is allowed to send messages. We show that our memoryless\ncommunication model capture the garden-hose model of computation by Buhrman et\nal. (ITCS'13), space bounded communication complexity by Brody et al.

We establish the following: (1) We\nshow that the memoryless communication complexity of F equals the logarithm of\nthe size of the smallest bipartite branching program computing F (up to a\nfactor 2); (2) We show that memoryless communication complexity equals\ngarden-hose complexity; (3) We exhibit various exponential separations between\nthese memoryless communication models.\n  We end with an intriguing open question: can we find an explicit function F\nand universal constant c>1 for which the memoryless communication complexity is\nat least $c \\log n$?

For flat surfaces,\nInverse Perspective Mapping (IPM) can accurately transform images to a BEV.\nThree-dimensional objects such as vehicles and vulnerable road users are\ndistorted by this transformation making it difficult to estimate their position\nrelative to the sensor.

For normal datasets, we\nassume that some latent domain information is available for transfer learning.\nThe instances in each domain can be inferred by different parameters. We obtain\nthis domain information from the distribution of the regression coefficients\ncorresponding to the explanatory variable $x$ as well as the response variable\n$y$ based on a Dirichlet process, which is more reasonable. As a result, we\ntransfer not only variable $x$ as usual but also variable $y$, which is\nchallenging since the testing data have no response value.

Comprehensive understanding of\npeculiarities of interactions of antimicrobial peptides with cell envelope is\nnecessary to perform the task-oriented design of new biotherapeutics, against\nwhich for microbes it is hard to work out resistance. In order to enable a de\nnovo design with low costs and in high throughput, in silico predictive models\nhave to be required. To develop the performant predictive model, comprehensive\nknowledge on mechanisms of action of AMPs has to be possessed. The last\nknowledge will allow us to encode amino acid sequences expressively and to get\nsuccess to the choosing of the accurate classifier of AMPs. A shared protective\nlayer of microbial cells is inner, plasmatic membrane. The interaction of AMP\nwith a biological membrane (native and/or artificial) is the most\ncomprehensively studied.

Our\nresults demonstrate that a software defined IoT network running our intrusion\nprevention technique at the optimal parameter setting prolongs system lifetime,\nincreases attack complexity of compromising critical nodes, and maintains\nsuperior service availability compared with a counterpart IoT network without\nrunning our intrusion prevention technique. Further, when given a single goal\nor a multi-objective goal (e.g., maximizing the system lifetime and service\navailability while minimizing the defense cost) as input, the best combination\nof \"how\" and \"how\" strategies is identified for executing our proposed\ntechnique under which the specified goal can be best achieved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 May 2020 09:30:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-12"}

Recent research has demonstrated that one of the most crucial\nchallenges in wireless deep learning is to counteract the channel action, which\nmay significantly alter the waveform features. The problem is further\nexacerbated by the fact that deep learning algorithms are hardly re-trainable\nin real time due to their sheer size. This paper proposes DeepFIR, a framework\nto counteract the channel action in wireless deep learning algorithms without\nretraining the underlying deep learning model. The key intuition is that\nthrough the application of a carefully-optimized digital finite input response\nfilter (FIR) at the transmitter's side, we can apply tiny modifications to the\nwaveform to strengthen its features according to the current channel\nconditions. We mathematically formulate the Waveform Optimization Problem (WOP)\nas the problem of finding the optimum FIR to be used on a waveform to improve\nthe classifier's accuracy. We also propose a data-driven methodology to train\nthe FIRs directly with dataset inputs. We extensively evaluate DeepFIR on a\nexperimental testbed of 20 software-defined radios, as well as on two datasets\nmade up by 500 ADS-B devices and by 500 WiFi devices and a 24-class modulation\ndataset.

A cloaking transformation maps the\nboundary-value problem of an isotropic and homogeneous elastic plate (virtual\nproblem) to that of an anisotropic and inhomogeneous elastic plate with a hole\nsurrounded by a cloak that is to be designed (physical problem). For\nKirchhoff-Love plates, the (out-of-plane) governing equations of the virtual\nplate is transformed to those of the physical plate up to an unknown scalar\nfield. In doing so, one finds the initial stress and the initial tangential\nbody force for the physical plate, along with a set of constraints that we call\ncloaking compatibility equations. These constraints involve the cloaking\ntransformation, the unknown scalar field, and the elastic constants of the\nvirtual plate. It is noted that the cloaking map needs to satisfy certain\nconditions on the outer boundary of the cloak and the surface of the hole. In\nparticular, the cloaking map needs to fix the outer boundary of the cloak up to\nthe third order. Assuming a generic radial cloaking map, we show that cloaking\na circular hole in Kirchoff-Love plates is not possible; the cloaking\ncompatibility equations and the boundary conditions that the cloaking map needs\nto satisfy are the obstruction to cloaking. Next, relaxing the pure bending\nassumption, the transformation cloaking problem of an elastic plate in the\npresence of in-plane and out-of-plane displacements is formulated. In this\ncase, there are two sets of governing equations that need to be simultaneously\ntransformed under the cloaking map.

In the current article, a collaborative prototyping/Wizard of Oz\napproach was used to explore generic robot art-making strategies and\npersonalization of art via an open-ended emotion profile intended to identify\ntricky concepts.

The\nformulation of higher spin gauge field theories, along with a Chern-Simons (CS)\nlike term for fields of higher spins is presented. Through this setup, general\nfeatures of theories describing massless/massive fields of higher spin in\narbitrary dimensions is discussed. In 2+1 dimensions, the existence of multiple\nmass-generating mechanisms i.e. metric-based masses and topological masses,\noffers the possibility for gauge bosons to acquire mixed masses. This scenario\nis first introduced in a theory of photons where both Proca mass term and CS\nmass term is simultaneously present. The mass-mixing which occurs in this\ntheory is further analysed through the St\\\"uckelberg formalism. Motivated by\nthese results, a theory of massive gravity where gravitons obtain masses from\nboth Fierz-Pauli mass term and CS mass term is studied. This theory allows for\n3 propagating massive graviton modes, and their masses have undergone\nconsiderable mixing. This mass-mixing is made explicit through a St\\\"uckelberg\nanalysis. The bimetric theory of gravity is a non-trivial generalization of the\ntheory of General Relativity. This theory provides a consistent non-linear\ntheory of massive gravity which is studied in detail. In this thesis, the\nbimetric theory of gravity is extended in 2+1 dimensiosn to the theory of\nTopologically Massive Bimetric Gravity (TMBG). In the theory of TMBG, the\nmass-mixing which arises from the interaction of the two metrics and their\ncorresponding CS terms occurs at the nonlinear stage itself. For the version of\nTMBG studied in this thesis, the linearized theory shows that there are 3\nmassive graviton modes, which corresponds to the same 3 modes found earlier.\nFinally, quantum loop corrections to the graviton propagator from massive\nphotons (which acquire mass from both CS and Proca mechanism) is calculated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 May 2020 12:42:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 23 Jan 2021 16:11:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-26"}

Herein, we propose a new approach to preterm\ninfants' limb pose estimation that features spatio-temporal information to\ndetect and track limb joints from depth videos with high reliability. Methods:\nLimb-pose estimation is performed using a deep-learning framework consisting of\na detection and a regression convolutional neural network (CNN) for rough and\nprecise joint localization, respectively. The CNNs are implemented to encode\nconnectivity in the temporal direction through 3D convolution. Assessment of\nthe proposed framework is performed through a comprehensive study with sixteen\ndepth videos acquired in the actual clinical practice from sixteen preterm\ninfants (the babyPose dataset). Results: When applied to pose estimation, the\nmedian root mean squared distance, computed among all limbs, between the\nestimated and the ground-truth pose was 9.06 pixels, overcoming approaches\nbased on spatial features only (11.27pixels). Conclusion: Results showed that\nthe spatio-temporal features had a significant influence on the pose-estimation\nperformance, especially in challenging cases (e.g., homogeneous image\nintensity). Significance: This paper significantly enhances the state of art in\nautomatic assessment of preterm infants' health status by introducing the use\nof spatio-temporal features for limb detection and tracking, and by being the\nfirst study to use depth videos acquired in the actual clinical practice for\nlimb-pose estimation. The babyPose dataset has been released as the first\nannotated dataset for infants' pose estimation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 May 2020 09:51:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-19"}

Statistical time lag is recorded and characterized,\ndisplaying a roughly exponential dependence on breakdown voltage. Of the\nmaterials tested, acrylic is observed to be the most resistant to flashover.\nThese data are intended to facilitate the design of compressed-air insulated\nhigh voltage systems as an alternative to SF6 insulated systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 May 2020 21:48:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2020 20:52:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-02"}
