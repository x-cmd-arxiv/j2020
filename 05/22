Distributed verifier proof systems are\na new family of proof models that involve a network of verifier nodes\ncommunicating with a single independent prover that has access to the complete\nnetwork structure of the verifiers. The prover is tasked with convincing all\nverifiers of some global property of the network graph. In addition, each\nindividual verifier may be given some input string they will be required to\nverify during the course of computation. Verifier nodes are allowed to exchange\nmessaged with nodes a constant distance away, and accept / reject the input\nafter some computation.\n  Because individual nodes are limited to a local view, communication with the\nprover is potentially necessary to prove global properties about the network\ngraph of nodes, which only the prover has access to. In this system of models,\nthe entire model accepts the input if and only if every individual node has\naccepted.\n  There are three models in the distributed verifier proof system family:\n$\\mathsf{LCP}$, $\\mathsf{dIP}$, and our proposed $\\mathsf{dPCP}$, with the\nfundamental difference between these coming from the type of communication\nestablished between the verifiers and the prover.

The trained CNN is tested to see if images can be accurately recovered\nfrom their corresponding sparse-view data.

The most\nmetal-rich of the three stars also possesses a small enhancement in rapid\nneutron-capture ($r$-process) elements. The abundance pattern of the\n$r$-process elements in this star matches the scaled $r$-process pattern of the\nsolar system and $r$-process enhanced stars in other dwarf galaxies and in the\nMilky Way halo, hinting at a common origin for these elements across a range of\nenvironments. All current proposed astrophysical sites of $r$-process element\nproduction are associated with high-mass stars, thus the possible top-heavy\ninitial mass function of Grus~II would increase the likelihood of any of these\nevents occurring.

An alternative is the assumption of local\nstyle patterns, where algorithms are designed to swap similar local features of\ncontent and style images. However, the limitation of these existing methods is\nthat they neglect the semantic structure of the content image which may lead to\ncorrupted content structure in the output. In this paper, we make a new\nassumption that image features from the same semantic region form a manifold\nand an image with multiple semantic regions follows a multi-manifold\ndistribution. Based on this assumption, the style transfer problem is\nformulated as aligning two multi-manifold distributions and a Manifold\nAlignment based Style Transfer (MAST) framework is proposed. The proposed\nframework allows semantically similar regions between the output and the style\nimage share similar style patterns. Moreover, the proposed manifold alignment\nmethod is flexible to allow user editing or using semantic segmentation maps as\nguidance for style transfer.

Specifically, a semiclassical closure\nof the nuclear Ehrenfest dynamics is obtained through a convenient prescription\nfor the nuclear Bohmian trajectories. The conical intersections are suitably\nregularized in the resulting nuclear particle motion and the associated Lorentz\nforce involves a smoothened Berry curvature identifying a loop-dependent\ngeometric phase. In turn, this geometric phase rapidly reaches the usual\ntopological index as the loop expands away from the original singularity. This\nfeature reproduces the phenomenology appearing in recent exact nonadiabatic\nstudies, as shown explicitly in the Jahn-Teller problem for linear vibronic\ncoupling. Likewise, a newly proposed regularization of the diagonal correction\nterm is also shown to reproduce quite faithfully the energy surface presented\nin recent nonadiabatic studies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 May 2020 17:05:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2020 23:33:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 8 Aug 2020 10:01:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-16"}

We study the\npotential reach of the HGCAL using a signal model in which the Standard Model\nHiggs boson decays into a pair of LLPs, $h \\to XX$. After carefully estimating\nthe Standard Model QCD and the misreconstructed fake-track backgrounds, we give\nthe projected reach for both a more conservative vector boson fusion trigger\nand a novel displaced-track-based trigger. Our results show that the best reach\nfor the Higgs decay branching ratio, BR$(h \\to XX)$, in the vector boson fusion\nchannel is about $\\mathcal{O}(10^{-4})$ with lifetime $c\\tau_X \\sim 0.1$--$1$\nmeters, while for the gluon gluon fusion channel it is about\n$\\mathcal{O}(10^{-5}\\text{--}10^{-6})$ for similar lifetimes. Alternatively,\nfor an LLP with $c\\tau_X \\sim 10^3$ meters, the HGCAL based search should be\nable to probe BR$(h\\to XX)$ down to a few $\\times 10^{-4}$($10^{-2}$) in the\ngluon gluon fusion (vector boson fusion) channels, respectively. In comparison\nwith these previous searches, our new search shows enhanced sensitivity in\ncomplementary regions of the LLP parameter space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 May 2020 18:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 2020 09:31:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-17"}

As a result, the elliptic genus is only a quasi-Jacobi form,\nrather than a modular or quasi-modular one in the usual sense.

We call this adversary \"$\\kappa$\ncomponents bounded\", or $\\kappa$-CB for short. On one hand, this adversary is\nrestricted compared to the classical adversary because of the $\\kappa$-CB\nconstraint. On the other hand, we seek competitive ratios parameterized only by\n$\\kappa$ with no dependence on the input length $n$, thereby giving the new\nadversary power to use arbitrarily large inputs.\n  We study online coloring under the $\\kappa$-CB adversary. We obtain finer\nanalysis of the existing algorithms $FirstFit$ and $CBIP$ by computing their\ncompetitive ratios on trees and bipartite graphs under the new adversary.\nSurprisingly, $FirstFit$ outperforms $CBIP$ on trees. When it comes to\nbipartite graphs $FirstFit$ is no longer competitive under the new adversary,\nwhile $CBIP$ uses at most $2\\kappa$ colors. We also study several well known\nclasses of graphs, such as $3$-colorable, $C_k$-free, $d$-inductive, planar,\nand bounded treewidth, with respect to online coloring under the $\\kappa$-CB\nadversary. We demonstrate that the extra adversarial power of unbounded input\nlength outweighs the restriction on the number of connected components leading\nto non existence of competitive algorithms for these classes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 May 2020 18:25:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-25"}

Although these optimization algorithms show\nimpressive performance, they are very computational demanding as they often\nrely on an iterative updating scheme. Recently, the rise of neural networks has\ninspired lots of learning based algorithms in unmixing literature. However,\nmost of them lack of interpretability and require a large training dataset. One\nnatural question then arises: can one leverage the model based algorithm and\nlearning based algorithm to achieve interpretable and fast algorithm for HSI\nunmixing problem? In this paper, we propose two novel network architectures,\nnamed U-ADMM-AENet and U-ADMM-BUNet, for abundance estimation and blind\nunmixing respectively, by combining the conventional optimization-model based\nunmixing method and the rising learning based unmixing method. We first\nconsider a linear mixture model with sparsity constraint, then we unfold\nAlternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm to construct the\nunmixing network structures. We also show that the unfolded structures can find\ncorresponding interpretations in machine learning literature, which further\ndemonstrates the effectiveness of proposed methods. Benefit from the\ninterpretation, the proposed networks can be initialized by incorporating prior\ninformation about the HSI data. Different from traditional unfolding networks,\nwe propose a new training strategy for proposed networks to better fit in the\nHSI applications. Extensive experiments show that the proposed methods can\nachieve much faster convergence and competitive performance even with very\nsmall size of training data, when compared with state-of-art algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 May 2020 18:49:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 30 May 2020 10:14:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-02"}

However, recent studies proposed the possible formation of\nJupiter by the hybrid accretion of pebbles and planetesimals. We aim to study\nthe full process of planet formation consisting of dust evolution, planetesimal\nformation and planet growth at a pressure maximum in a protoplanetary disk. We\ncompute, through numerical simulations, the gas and dust evolution, including\ndust growth, fragmentation, radial drift and particle accumulation at a\npressure bump. We also consider the formation of planetesimals by streaming\ninstability and the formation of a moon-size embryo that grows into a giant\nplanet by the hybrid accretion of pebbles and planetesimals. We find that\npressure maxima in protoplanetary disks are efficient collectors of dust\ndrifting inwards. The condition of planetesimal formation by streaming\ninstability is fulfilled due to the large amount of dust accumulated at the\npressure bump. Then, a massive core is quickly formed (in $\\sim 10^4$ yr) by\nthe accretion of pebbles. After the pebble isolation mass is reached, the\ngrowth of the core slowly continues by the accretion of planetesimals. The\nenergy released by planetesimal accretion delays the onset of runaway gas\naccretion, allowing a gas giant to form after $\\sim$1 Myr of disk evolution.\nThe pressure maximum also acts as a migration trap. Pressure maxima in\nprotoplanetary disks are preferential locations for dust traps, planetesimal\nformation by streaming instability and planet migration traps. All these\nconditions allow the fast formation of a giant planet by the hybrid accretion\nof pebbles and planetesimals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 May 2020 19:40:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Aug 2020 04:52:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 14 Aug 2020 07:02:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-14"}

Geometry optimisations of 100 structures with a\n12.5% dopant concentration allowed us to identify a clear correlation between\nthe bending of the metal-oxygen-metal angle and the energies of the simulated\ncells. Depending on the type of bending, two configurations, designated as\ninwards bending and outwards bending, were defined. The results demonstrate\nthat a larger bending decreases the energy and that the lowest energies are\nobserved for structures combining inwards bending with protons being close to\nthe dopant atoms.

On average, in the\nDFT-MD simulations, the hydrogen bond lengths are shorter for the outwards\nconfiguration which facilitates the intraoctahedral jumps.

Even for the simplest multielectron atom, helium, new DI\nmechanisms are still being found. To first order in the field strength, a\nstrong external field doubly ionizes the electrons in helium such that they are\nejected into the same direction (front-to-back motion). The ejection into\nopposite directions (back-to-back motion) cannot be described to first order,\nmaking it a challenging target for control. Here, we address this challenge and\noptimize the field with the objective of back-to-back double ionization using a\n(1 + 1)-dimensional model. The optimization is performed using four different\ncontrol procedures: (1) short-time control, (2) derivative-free optimization of\nbasis expansions of the field, (3) the Krotov method, and (4) control of the\nclassical equations of motion. All four procedures lead to fields with dominant\nback-to-back motion. All the fields obtained exploit essentially the same\ntwo-step mechanism leading to back-to-back motion: first, the electrons are\ndisplaced by the field into the same direction. Second, after the field turns\noff, the nuclear attraction and the electron-electron repulsion combine to\ngenerate the final motion into opposite directions for each electron. By\nperforming quasi-classical calculations, we confirm that this mechanism is\nessentially classical.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 May 2020 20:16:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Oct 2021 17:33:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-12"}

A common\nkind of bias arises when selecting studies using a set of inclusion/exclusion\ncriteria. This bias can be decreased through dual revision, which makes the\nselection process more time-consuming and remains prone to generating bias\ndepending on how each researcher interprets the inclusion/exclusion criteria.\nObjective: To reduce the bias and time spent in the study selection process,\nthis paper presents a process for selecting studies based on the use of Cohen's\nKappa statistic. We have defined an iterative process based on the use of this\nstatistic during which the criteria are refined until obtain almost perfect\nagreement (k>0.8). At this point, the two researchers interpret the selection\ncriteria in the same way, and thus, the bias is reduced. Starting from this\nagreement, dual review can be eliminated; consequently, the time spent is\ndrastically shortened. Method: The feasibility of this iterative process for\nselecting studies is demonstrated through a tertiary study in the area of\nsoftware engineering on works that were published from 2005 to 2018. Results:\nThe time saved in the study selection process was 28% (for 152 studies) and if\nthe number of studies is sufficiently large, the time saved tend asymptotically\nto 50%. Conclusions: Researchers and students may take advantage of this\niterative process for selecting studies when conducting SLRs to reduce bias in\nthe interpretation of inclusion and exclusion criteria. It is especially useful\nfor research with few resources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 May 2020 20:26:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-28"}

One of the main\nchallenges of Network Science consists in predicting the impact of network\ntopology and dynamics on the evolution of the states and, especially, on the\nemergence of collective phenomena, such as synchronization. We address this\nproblem by proposing a Dynamics Approximate Reduction Technique (DART) that\nmaps high-dimensional (complete) dynamics unto low-dimensional (reduced)\ndynamics while preserving the most salient features, both topological and\ndynamical, of the original system. DART generalizes recent approaches for\ndimension reduction by allowing the treatment of complex-valued dynamical\nvariables, heterogeneities in the intrinsic properties of the nodes as well as\nmodular networks with strongly interacting communities. Most importantly, we\nidentify three major reduction procedures whose relative accuracy depends on\nwhether the evolution of the states is mainly determined by the intrinsic\ndynamics, the degree sequence, or the adjacency matrix.

At a frame time of 4.4 ms, the first passage time distribution\nfor a 14-nt displacement domain exhibited a nearly monotonic decay with little\ndelay. Among the eight different sequences we tested, the mean displacement\ntime was on average 35 ms and varied by up to a factor of 13. The measured\ndisplacement kinetics also varied between complementary invaders and between\nRNA and DNA invaders of the same base sequence except for T$\\rightarrow$U\nsubstitution. However, displacement times were largely insensitive to the\nmonovalent salt concentration in the range of 0.25 M to 1 M. Using a\none-dimensional random walk model, we infer that the single-step displacement\ntime is in the range of $\\sim 30 \\mu s$ to $\\sim 300 \\mu s$ depending on the\nbase identity. The framework presented here is broadly applicable to the\nkinetic analysis of multistep processes investigated at the single-molecule\nlevel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 May 2020 22:14:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 20 May 2021 17:36:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-21"}

Addressing this\nconcern, in-band fullduplex (IBFD) has the potential to double the efficiency\nin a given bandwidth. In an IBFD scheme, transmission and reception are\nperformed simultaneously in the same frequency band. However, in UWA-IBFD,\nbecause of reflections from the surface and bottom and the inhomogeneity of the\nwater, a significant part of the transmitted signal returns back to the IBFD\nreceiver. This signal contaminates the desired signal from the remote end and\nis known as the self-interference (SI). With an estimate of the\nself-interference channel impulse response (SCIR), a receiver can estimate and\neliminate the SI. A better understanding of the statistical characteristics of\nthe SCIR is necessary for an accurate SI cancellation. In this article, we use\nan orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal to characterize the\nSCIR in a lake water experiment. To verify the results, SCIR estimation is\nperformed using estimators in both the frequency and time domains. We show\nthat, in our experiment, regardless of the depth of the hydrophone, the direct\npath of SCIR is strong, stable and easily tracked; however, the reflection\npaths are weaker and rapidly time-varying making SI cancellation challenging.\nAmong the reflections, the first bounce from the water surface is the prevalent\npath with a short coherence time around 70 ms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 May 2020 22:45:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-25"}

The instrument is sensitive to photons in the energy\nrange $0.2$-$5$ MeV. Compton telescopes have the advantage of a unique imaging\nresponse and provide the possibility of strong background suppression. With its\nhigh-purity germanium detectors, COSI can precisely map $\\gamma$-ray line\nemission. The strongest persistent and diffuse $\\gamma$-ray line signal is the\n511 keV emission line from the annihilation of electrons with positrons from\nthe direction of the Galactic centre. While many sources have been proposed to\nexplain the amount of positrons, $\\dot{N}_{\\mathrm{e^+}} \\sim\n10^{50}\\,\\mathrm{e^+\\,yr^{-1}}$, the true contributions remain unsolved. In\nthis study, we aim at imaging the 511 keV sky with COSI and pursue a\nfull-forward modelling approach, using a simulated and binned imaging response.\nFor the strong instrumental background, we describe an empirical approach to\ntake the balloon environment into account. We perform two alternative methods\nto describe the signal: Richardson-Lucy deconvolution, an iterative method\ntowards the maximum likelihood solution, and model fitting with pre-defined\nemission templates.

For large-scale emission with weak gradients, coded\naperture mask instruments suffer from their inability to distinguish isotropic\nemission from instrumental background, while Compton-telescopes provide a clear\nimaging response, independent of the true emission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 May 2020 00:16:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-08"}

The severity and brutality of COVID-19 have led\nto the development of extreme feelings, and emotional and mental healthcare\nchallenges. This research identifies emotional consequences - the presence of\nextreme fear, confusion and volatile sentiments, mixed along with trust and\nanticipation. It is necessary to gauge dominant public sentiment trends for\neffective decisions and policies. This study analyzes public sentiment using\nTwitter Data, time-aligned to COVID-19, to identify dominant sentiment trends\nassociated with the push to 'reopen' the economy. Present research uses textual\nanalytics methodologies to analyze public sentiment support for two potential\ndivergent scenarios - an early opening and a delayed opening, and consequences\nof each. Present research concludes on the basis of exploratory textual\nanalytics and textual data visualization, that Tweets data from American\nTwitter users shows more trust sentiment support, than fear, for reopening the\nUS economy. With additional validation, this could present a valuable time\nsensitive opportunity for state governments, the federal government,\ncorporations and societal leaders to guide the nation into a successful new\nnormal future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 May 2020 01:29:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-25"}

Specifically, OMT with quadratic cost may be viewed\nas a zero-temperature limit of SBP, which amounts to minimization of the\nHelmholtz's free energy over probability distributions constrained to possess\ngiven marginals. The problem features a delicate compromise, mediated by a\ntemperature parameter, between minimizing the internal energy and maximizing\nthe entropy.

Due to the constraint on\nend-point distributions, dynamic programming is not a suitable tool to attack\nthese problems. Instead, Fortet's iterative algorithm and its discrete\ncounterpart, the Sinkhorn iteration, permit computation by iteratively solving\nthe so-called {\\em Schroedinger system}.

Strategies to do so include imposing self-consistent sets of\ntriadic interactions, proposing various source models, or through turbulence\nmodelling. For the latter, several investigators have proposed using the\nmean-field eddy viscosity acting linearly on the fluctuation field. In this\nstudy, a data-driven approach is taken to quantitatively improve linear\nresolvent models by deducing an optimal eddy-viscosity field that maximizes the\nprojection of the dominant resolvent mode to the energy-optimal coherent\nstructure educed using spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) of data\nfrom high-fidelity simulations.

In this paper, we show that transition\nto runaway gas accretion by cores may be self-impeded by an increase of the\ngrain opacity in their envelope after they have acquired sufficient mass\n(typically 10Mearth) to enter a pebble-isolation phase. The accumulation of\nmm-m size pebbles in their migration barriers enhances their local\nfragmentation rates. The freshly produced sub-mm grains pass through the\nbarrier, elevate the effective dust opacity and reduce the radiative flux in\nthe cores envelope. These effects alone are adequate to suppress the transition\nto runaway accretion and preserve super-Earths in the stellar proximity (0.1\nAU), albeit entropy advection between the envelope and the disk can further\nreduce the accretion rate. At intermediate distance (1AU) from their host\nstars, the escalation in the dust opacity dominates over entropy advection in\nstalling the transition to runaway accretion for marginally pebble-isolated\ncores. Beyond a few AU, the transformation of more massive cores to gas giants\nis reachable before severe depletion of disk gas. This requirement can be\nsatisfied either in extended disks with large scale height via orderly\naccretion of migrating pebbles or through the mergers of oligarchic\nprotoplanetary embryos, and can account for the correlated occurrence of\nlong-period gas giants and close-in super-Earths.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 May 2020 02:51:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-01"}

Each model describes two pairs of\nHofstadter butterflies that are spin-orbit coupled. In contrast to the original\nHofstadter model that can be equivalently studied in the Landau and symmetric\ngauges, the corresponding non-Abelian generalizations exhibit distinct spectra\ndue to the non-commutativity of the gauge fields. We derive the genuine\n(necessary and sufficient) non-Abelian condition for the two models from the\ncommutativity of their arbitrary loop operators.

First, we propose a novel\nConvolutional deep Domain Adaptation model for Time Series data (CoDATS) that\nsignificantly improves accuracy and training time over state-of-the-art DA\nstrategies on real-world sensor data benchmarks. By utilizing data from\nmultiple source domains, we increase the usefulness of CoDATS to further\nimprove accuracy over prior single-source methods, particularly on complex time\nseries datasets that have high variability between domains. Second, we propose\na novel Domain Adaptation with Weak Supervision (DA-WS) method by utilizing\nweak supervision in the form of target-domain label distributions, which may be\neasier to collect than additional data labels. Third, we perform comprehensive\nexperiments on diverse real-world datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of our\ndomain adaptation and weak supervision methods.

A\ndetailed understanding of CAE/GAE excitation, therefore, is vital to predicting\n(and ultimately controlling) their effects on plasma confinement. To this end,\nhybrid kinetic-MHD simulations are complemented with an analytic study of the\nlinear stability properties of CAEs and GAEs.

A comprehensive set of simulations of\nNSTX-like plasmas has been performed for a wide range of beam parameters,\nproviding a wealth of information on CAE and GAE stability in spherical\ntokamaks. Linear simulations show that the excitation of CAEs vs GAEs has a\ncomplex dependence on the fast ion injection velocity and geometry,\nqualitatively described by the analytic theory developed in this thesis. Strong\nenergetic particle modifications of GAEs are found in simulations, indicating\nthe existence of a new type of high frequency energetic particle mode. A cross\nvalidation between the theoretical stability bounds, simulation results, and\nexperimental measurements shows favorable agreement for both the unstable CAE\nand GAE spectra's dependence on fast ion parameters. The analytic results\naccurately explain the recent experimental discovery of GAE stabilization with\nsmall amounts of off-axis beam injection on NSTX-U and suggest new techniques\nfor control of these instabilities in future experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 May 2020 05:27:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-11"}

Therefore, it is valuable to develop accurate and real-time vision\nprocessing models that only require limited computational resources. To this\nend, we propose the Spatial-detail Guided Context Propagation Network (SGCPNet)\nfor achieving real-time semantic segmentation.

In particular the fate\nof the edge state as a mediator of transition is unclear. A deterministic\nthree-dimensional model is suggested, parametrised by the linear instability\ngrowth rate. The edge manifold evolves topologically, via a global saddle-loop\nbifurcation, from the separatrix between two attraction basins to the mediator\nbetween two transition routes.

The development of computer-aided systems based on deep\nneural networks (DNNs) has been advanced, to rapidly and accurately detect\nCOVID-19 cases, because the need for expert radiologists, who are limited in\nnumber, forms a bottleneck for the screening. However, so far, the\nvulnerability of DNN-based systems has been poorly evaluated, although DNNs are\nvulnerable to a single perturbation, called universal adversarial perturbation\n(UAP), which can induce DNN failure in most classification tasks. Thus, we\nfocus on representative DNN models for detecting COVID-19 cases from chest\nX-ray images and evaluate their vulnerability to UAPs generated using simple\niterative algorithms. We consider nontargeted UAPs, which cause a task failure\nresulting in an input being assigned an incorrect label, and targeted UAPs,\nwhich cause the DNN to classify an input into a specific class. The results\ndemonstrate that the models are vulnerable to nontargeted and targeted UAPs,\neven in case of small UAPs. In particular, 2% norm of the UPAs to the average\nnorm of an image in the image dataset achieves >85% and >90% success rates for\nthe nontargeted and targeted attacks, respectively. Due to the nontargeted\nUAPs, the DNN models judge most chest X-ray images as COVID-19 cases. The\ntargeted UAPs make the DNN models classify most chest X-ray images into a given\ntarget class. The results indicate that careful consideration is required in\npractical applications of DNNs to COVID-19 diagnosis; in particular, they\nemphasize the need for strategies to address security concerns. As an example,\nwe show that iterative fine-tuning of the DNN models using UAPs improves the\nrobustness of the DNN models against UAPs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 May 2020 08:54:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-21"}

Due to the presence of electric charge $q_e > 0$, both the\nscalar and electromagnetic field perturbations decay more slowly when compared\nto the Schwarzschild-Tangherlini black holes. We discover that the scalar field\nperturbations oscillate more rapidly when compared to the electromagnetic field\nperturbations. In terms of damping, the scalar field perturbations damp more\nquickly. Graphically we show that the transmission (reflection) coefficients\ndecrease (increase) with an increase in the magnitude of the electric charge\n$q_e$. The emission of gravitational waves allows spacetime to undergo damped\noscillations due to the nonzero value of the imaginary part, which is always\nnegative. The imaginary part of the QNMs frequencies is continuously decreasing\nwith an increase in the magnitude of the electric charge $q_e$ for a given mode\n($l,n$). A connection between the QNMs frequencies and the black hole shadow,\nas well as the geometric cross-section in the eikonal limit, is also described.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 May 2020 09:40:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Aug 2020 06:59:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-16"}

Instead of explicitly specifying a\nprior that encodes the expected shape properties, the prior is defined\nautomatically using the input point cloud, which we refer to as a self-prior.\nThe self-prior encapsulates reoccurring geometric repetitions from a single\nshape within the weights of a deep neural network. We optimize the network\nweights to deform an initial mesh to shrink-wrap a single input point cloud.\nThis explicitly considers the entire reconstructed shape, since shared local\nkernels are calculated to fit the overall object. The convolutional kernels are\noptimized globally across the entire shape, which inherently encourages\nlocal-scale geometric self-similarity across the shape surface. We show that\nshrink-wrapping a point cloud with a self-prior converges to a desirable\nsolution; compared to a prescribed smoothness prior, which often becomes\ntrapped in undesirable local minima. While the performance of traditional\nreconstruction approaches degrades in non-ideal conditions that are often\npresent in real world scanning, i.e., unoriented normals, noise and missing\n(low density) parts, Point2Mesh is robust to non-ideal conditions.

To address that, this paper presents a fast and effective\nregistration method for the two types of images.

Methods: In this retrospective study, we evaluated\n1,216 patients from two separate institutions who underwent CT for the presence\nof saccular IA>=2.5 mm.

Our lower bound is simpler and stronger in\nseveral aspects: The lower bound of Assadi et al. only holds for algorithms\nthat (1) are able to process streams that contain a triple exponential number\nof deletions in $n$, the number of vertices of the input graph; (2) are able to\nprocess multi-graphs; and (3) never output edges that do not exist in the input\ngraph when the randomized algorithm errs. In contrast, our lower bound even\nholds for algorithms that (1) rely on short ($O(n^2)$-length) input streams;\n(2) are only able to process simple graphs; and (3) may output non-existing\nedges when the algorithm errs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 May 2020 11:34:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-25"}

It is thus imperative to\nunderstand and mitigate red noise in the PTA data.

The results provide insights on the degree of thermalization of\nbeauty quarks in the medium. A model assuming full thermalization of beauty\nquarks is strongly disfavoured by the measurement at high $p_{\\rm{T}}$, but is\nin agreement with the results at low $p_{\\rm{T}}$. Transport models including\nsubstantial interactions of beauty quarks with an expanding\nstrongly-interacting medium describe the measurement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 May 2020 12:07:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 May 2021 16:06:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-19"}

Designing an\nefficient graph algorithm based on multiple random walks requires investigating\nmultiple random walks theoretically to attain a deep understanding of their\ncharacteristics. The first meeting time is one of the important metrics for\nmultiple random walks. The first meeting time on a graph is defined by the time\nit takes for multiple random walkers to meet at the same node in a graph. This\ntime is closely related to the rendezvous problem, a fundamental problem in\ncomputer science. The first meeting time of multiple random walks has been\nanalyzed previously, but many of these analyses have focused on regular graphs.\nIn this paper, we analyze the first meeting time of multiple random walks in\narbitrary graphs and clarify the effects of graph structures on expected\nvalues. First, we derive the spectral formula of the expected first meeting\ntime on the basis of spectral graph theory. Then, we examine the principal\ncomponent of the expected first meeting time using the derived spectral\nformula. The clarified principal component reveals that (a)the expected first\nmeeting time is almost dominated by $n/(1+d_{\\rm std}^2/d_{\\rm avg}^2)$ and\n(b)the expected first meeting time is independent of the starting nodes of\nrandom walkers, where $n$ is the number of nodes of the graph. $d_{\\rm avg}$\nand $d_{\\rm std}$ are the average and the standard deviation of weighted node\ndegrees, respectively. The characteristic(a) is useful for understanding the\neffect of the graph structure on the first meeting time. According to the\nrevealed effect of graph structures, the variance of the coefficient $d_{\\rm\nstd}/d_{\\rm avg}$(degree heterogeneity) for weighted degrees facilitates the\nmeeting of random walkers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 May 2020 13:04:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 29 May 2020 10:48:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 10 Jun 2020 10:25:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-11"}

Recently, their extragalactic nature has been demonstrated and\nan increasing number of the sources have been found to repeat. Young, highly\nmagnetized, isolated neutron stars - magnetars - have been suggested as the\nmost promising candidates for fast radio burst progenitors owing to their\nenergetics and high X-ray flaring activity.

Thus, this is the first simultaneous detection of a fast radio burst\nfrom a Galactic magnetar and its high-energy counterpart. The total energy\nemitted in X-rays in this burst is typical of bright short magnetar bursts, but\nan unusual hardness of its energy spectrum strongly distinguish the April 28\nevent among multiple \"ordinary\" flares detected from SGR~1935+2154 previously.\nThis, and a recent non-detection of radio emission from about one hundred\ntypical soft bursts from SGR 1935+2154 favors the idea that bright, FRB-like\nmagnetar signals are associated with rare, hard-spectrum X-ray bursts, which\nimplied rate ($\\sim$ 0.04 yr$^{-1}$ magnetar$^{-1}$) appears consistent with\nthe rate estimate of SGR 1935+2154-like radio bursts (0.007 - 0.04 yr$^{-1}$\nmagnetar$^{-1}$).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 May 2020 13:31:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Mar 2021 16:22:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-21"}

In\nessence, it would be beneficial to extract as much task-relevant information as\npossible from the elevation grid. However, given the complexities of the\nnatural world, chance dictates that the use of 'off-the-shelf' filters is\nunlikely to derive covariates that provide strong explanatory power to the\ntarget variable at hand, and any attempt to manually design informative\ncovariates is likely to be a trial-and-error process -- not optimal.

We report on the on-chip\nintegration of a quantum dot microlens with a 3D-printed micro-objective in\ncombination with a single-mode on-chip fiber coupler. The practical quantum\ndevice is realized by deterministic fabrication of the QD-microlens via in-situ\nelectron-beam lithography and 3D two-photon laser writing of the on-chip\nmicro-objective and fiber-holder. The QD with microlens is an efficient\nsingle-photon source, whose emission is collimated by the on-chip\nmicro-objective. A second polymer microlens is located at the end facet of the\nsingle-mode fiber and ensures that the collimated light is efficiently coupled\ninto the fiber core. For this purpose, the fiber is placed in the on-chip fiber\nchuck, which is precisely aligned to the QD-microlens thanks to the sub-$\\mu$m\nprocessing accuracy of high-resolution two-photon direct laser writing.

Two\nray-tracing approaches are derived and compared. More significantly, the\nproblem of linking the rays between emitters and receivers, which is\nchallenging in 3D due to the high number of degrees of freedom for the\ntrajectory of rays, is analysed both as a minimisation and as a root-finding\nproblem.

These sub-Saturns exhibit a diversity of bulk\ndensities, ranging from ~$0.1-3\\ \\rm{g\\ cm}^{-3}$. When modeled simply as\nhydrogen/helium envelopes atop rocky cores, this diversity in densities\ntranslates to a diversity in planetary envelope fractions,\n$f_\\rm{env}=M_\\rm{env}/M_p$ ranging from ~$10\\%$ to ~$50\\%$. Planets with\n$f_\\rm{env}\\sim50\\%$ pose a challenge to traditional models of giant planet\nformation by core-nucleated accretion, which predict the onset of runaway gas\naccretion when $M_\\rm{env}\\sim M_\\rm{core}$. Here we show that many of these\napparent $f_\\rm{env}\\sim50\\%$ planets are less envelope rich than they seem,\nafter accounting for tidal heating. We present a new framework for modeling\nsub-Saturn interiors that incorporates envelope inflation due to tides, which\nare driven by the observed non-zero eccentricities, as well as potential\nobliquities. Consequently, when we apply our models to known sub-Saturns, we\ninfer lower $f_\\rm{env}$ than tides-free estimates. We present a case study of\nK2-19 b, a moderately eccentric sub-Saturn. Neglecting tides, K2-19 b appears\nto have $f_\\rm{env}\\sim50\\%$, poised precariously near the runaway threshold;\nby including tides, we find $f_\\rm{env}\\sim10\\%$, resolving the tension.\nThrough a systematic analysis of $4-8\\ R_{\\oplus}$ planets, we find that most\n(but not all) of the similarly envelope-rich planets have more modest envelopes\nof $f_\\rm{env}\\sim10\\%-20\\%$. Thus, many sub-Saturns may be understood as\nsub-Neptunes that have undergone significant radius inflation, rather than a\nseparate class of objects. Tidal radius inflation likely plays an important\nrole in other size classes of planets including ultra-low-density Jupiter-size\nplanets like WASP-107 b.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 May 2020 14:36:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-08"}

However, to produce similar high-density plasmas for fusion relevant\ngases such as hydrogen, deuterium and helium, much higher RF powers are needed.\nFor very high RF powers, thermal issues of the RF-transparent dielectric\nwindow, used in the RF source design, limit the plasma operation timescales. To\nmitigate this constraint, we have designed, built and tested a novel\nliquid-cooled RF window which allows steady state operations at high power (up\nto 20 kW). De-ionized (DI) water, flowing between two concentric dielectric RF\nwindows, is used as the coolant. We show that a full azimuthal blanket of DI\nwater does not degrade plasma production. We obtain steady-state, high-density\nplasmas (n > 10^19 m-3, T_e ~ 5 eV) using both argon and hydrogen. From\ncalorimetry on the DI water, we measure the net heat that is being removed by\nthe coolant at steady state conditions. Using infra-red (IR) imaging, we\ncalculate the constant plasma heat deposition and measure the final steady\nstate temperature distribution patterns on the inner surface of the ceramic\nlayer. We find that the heat deposition pattern follows the helical shape of\nthe antenna. We also show the consistency between the heat absorbed by the DI\nwater, as measured by calorimetry, and the total heat due to the combined\neffect of the plasma heating and the absorbed RF.

In this paper we show the derivation of such a physically\nmotivated background model, which includes the modeling of the different\nbackground sources and the correct handling of the response of GBM. While the\ngoal of the paper is to introduce the model rather than developing a transient\nsearch algorithm, we demonstrate the ability of the model to fit the background\nseen by GBM by showing four applications, namely (1) for a canonical GRB, (2)\nfor the ultra-long GRB 091024, (3) for the V404 Cygni outburst in June 2015,\nand (4) the ultra-long GRB 130925A.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 May 2020 14:57:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-05"}

In digital quantum computing, it has\nbeen shown that random parameterized quantum circuits are able to express\ncomplex distributions intractable by a classical computer, leading to the\ndemonstration of quantum supremacy. However, their chaotic nature makes\nparameter optimization challenging in variational approaches. Evidence of\nsimilar classically-intractable expressibility has been recently demonstrated\nin analog quantum computing with driven many-body systems. A thorough\ninvestigation of trainability of such analog systems is yet to be performed. In\nthis work, we investigate how the interplay between external driving and\ndisorder in the system dictates the trainability and expressibility of\ninteracting quantum systems. We show that if the system thermalizes, the\ntraining fails at the expense of the a large expressibility, while the opposite\nhappens when the system enters the many-body localized (MBL) phase. From this\nobservation, we devise a protocol using quenched MBL dynamics which allows\naccurate trainability while keeping the overall dynamics in the quantum\nsupremacy regime. Our work shows the fundamental connection between quantum\nmany-body physics and its application in machine learning. We conclude our work\nwith an example application in generative modeling employing a well studied\nanalog many-body model of a driven Ising spin chain.

With\nthis new perspective, a novel $L2R^2$ approach is proposed under the\nlearning-to-rank framework.

A proof of concept prototype was explored using a\nregulator based self-assessment checklist to establish if RegTech best practice\ncould improve the demonstration of GDPR compliance. The application of a\nRegTech approach provides opportunities for demonstrable and validated GDPR\ncompliance, notwithstanding the risk reductions and cost savings that RegTech\ncan deliver. This paper demonstrates a RegTech approach to GDPR compliance can\nfacilitate an organisation meeting its accountability obligations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 May 2020 18:55:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-26"}

User interests\nintuitively follow a hierarchical pattern such that users generally show\ninterests from a higher-level then to a lower-level abstraction. Modeling such\nan interest hierarchy in an attention network can fundamentally improve the\nrepresentation of user behaviors. We, therefore, propose an improvement over\nDIN to model arbitrary interest hierarchy: Deep Interest with Hierarchical\nAttention Network (DHAN). In this model, a multi-dimensional hierarchical\nstructure is introduced on the first attention layer which attends to an\nindividual item, and the subsequent attention layers in the same dimension\nattend to higher-level hierarchy built on top of the lower corresponding\nlayers. To enable modeling of multiple dimensional hierarchies, an expanding\nmechanism is introduced to capture one to many hierarchies. This design enables\nDHAN to attend different importance to different hierarchical abstractions thus\ncan fully capture user interests at different dimensions (e.g. category, price,\nor brand).To validate our model, a simplified DHAN has applied to Click-Through\nRate (CTR) prediction and our experimental results on three public datasets\nwith two levels of the one-dimensional hierarchy only by category.

Rover runs in a joint optimization framework,\nfusing measurements from backscattered WiFi signals and inertial sensors to\nsimultaneously estimate the locations of both the robot and the connected tags.\nOur design addresses practical issues including interference among multiple\ntags, real-time processing, as well as the data marginalization problem in\ndealing with degenerated motions. We prototype Rover using off-the-shelf WiFi\nchips and customized backscatter tags. Our experiments show that Rover achieves\nlocalization accuracies of 39.3 cm for the robot and 74.6 cm for the tags.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 May 2020 20:19:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-28"}

This\nimplies that the Friedmann equations valid for the transparent universe must be\nmodified for the opaque universe. The paper studies a scenario when the opacity\nsteeply rises with redshift. In this case, the light-matter interactions become\nimportant, because cosmic opacity produces radiation pressure that\ncounterbalances gravitational forces. The presented theoretical model assumes\nthe Universe expanding according to the standard FLRW metric but with the scale\nfactor $a(t)$ depending on both types of forces: gravity as well as radiation\npressure. The modified Friedmann equations predicts a cyclic\nexpansion/contraction evolution of the Universe within a limited range of scale\nfactors with no initial singularity. The model avoids dark energy and removes\nsome other tensions of the standard cosmological model. The paper demonstrates\nthat considering light-matter interactions in cosmic dynamics is crucial and\ncan lead to new cosmological models essentially different from the standard\n$\\Lambda$CDM model.
