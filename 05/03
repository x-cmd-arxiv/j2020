The meeting, called\nrendezvous, occurs when agents are at distance at most $r$ of each other and\nnever move after this time, where $r$ is a positive real unknown to them,\ncalled the visibility radius. Agents are anonymous and execute the same\ndeterministic algorithm. Each agent has a set of private attributes, some or\nall of which can differ between agents. These attributes are: the initial\nposition of the agent, its system of coordinates (orientation and chirality),\nthe rate of its clock, its speed when it moves, and the time of its wake-up. If\nall attributes (except the initial positions) are identical and agents start at\ndistance larger than $r$ then they can never meet. However, differences between\nattributes make it sometimes possible to break the symmetry and accomplish\nrendezvous. Such instances of the rendezvous problem (formalized as lists of\nattributes), are called feasible.\n  Our contribution is three-fold. We first give an exact characterization of\nfeasible instances. Thus it is natural to ask whether there exists a single\nalgorithm that guarantees rendezvous for all these instances. We give a strong\nnegative answer to this question: we show two sets $S_1$ and $S_2$ of feasible\ninstances such that none of them admits a single rendezvous algorithm valid for\nall instances of the set. On the other hand, we construct a single algorithm\nthat guarantees rendezvous for all feasible instances outside of sets $S_1$ and\n$S_2$. We observe that these exception sets $S_1$ and $S_2$ are geometrically\nvery small, compared to the set of all feasible instances: they are included in\nlow-dimension subspaces of the latter. Thus, our rendezvous algorithm handling\nall feasible instances other than these small sets of exceptions can be justly\ncalled almost universal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 May 2020 16:30:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-05"}

Therefore,\ninstantiating MEC slices without incurring in resource over-provisioning is\nhardly addressable with existing slicing algorithms. The main innovation of\nthis paper is Sl-EDGE, a unified MEC slicing framework that allows network\noperators to instantiate heterogeneous slice services (e.g., video streaming,\ncaching, 5G network access) on edge devices.

Several common technologies used on grain harvesters, including impact\nplate sensors, are accurate enough on combines to be valuable but suffer from\nissues such as drift. Sugarcane is composed of a mixture of billets and trash,\nwhich is a very dispersed material with much less consistency than grains. In\nthis study, a 3d point cloud approach is used to estimate volume, from which a\ncalibration factor is derived [density] to translate to mass. The system was\nproved in concept in a controlled environment using bamboo, achieving an R2 of\n97.4% when fitting average volume flow per test against average mass flow after\ncorrecting for bulk density changes with volume. The system was also tested on\nfield data, which was collected from nearly 1700 wagon loads from the southern\nU.S. and Brazil over the course of 3 seasons in both green and burnt cane.\nResults indicated that the concept is very robust with good accuracy, having\nseasonal CVs for density values ranging from 6.9% to 16.2%. The camera concept\nproves relatively robust to environmental conditions. The same approach could\nbe used in sugar beets, potatoes or other sparse/non-flowing crops with highly\nvarying material properties, where traditional mass flow sensors do not work.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 May 2020 19:24:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-05"}

To address this problem, we\npropose a multi-modality generative adversarial network (MGAN) to synthesize\nthree high-quality MR modalities (FLAIR, T1 and T1ce) from one MR modality T2\nsimultaneously. The experimental results show that the quality of the\nsynthesized images by our proposed methods is better than the one synthesized\nby the baseline model, pix2pix. Besides, for MR brain image synthesis, it is\nimportant to preserve the critical tumor information in the generated\nmodalities, so we further introduce a multi-modality tumor consistency loss to\nMGAN, called TC-MGAN. We use the synthesized modalities by TC-MGAN to boost the\ntumor segmentation accuracy, and the results demonstrate its effectiveness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 2 May 2020 21:33:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-05"}

However, the content on focal planes close to the eye do not\nocclude those farther away; this deteriorates the occlusion cue as well as\nreduces contrast at depth discontinuities due to leakage of the defocus blur.\nThis paper enables occlusion-aware multifocal displays using a novel ConeTilt\noperator that provides an additional degree of freedom -- tilting the light\ncone emitted at each pixel of the display panel.

The performance of medical image segmentation\nhas been significantly advanced with the convolutional neural networks (CNNs).\nHowever, most existing CNNs-based methods often produce unsatisfactory\nsegmentation mask without accurate object boundaries. This is caused by the\nlimited context information and inadequate discriminative feature maps after\nconsecutive pooling and convolution operations. In that the medical image is\ncharacterized by the high intra-class variation, inter-class indistinction and\nnoise, extracting powerful context and aggregating discriminative features for\nfine-grained segmentation are still challenging today.

Using the\nfirst law of thermodynamics, we may correlate tiny changes in entanglement\nentropy with the temperature fluctuations.

However, most existing models penalize the noises, if\noccurring, by employing the least squares loss, which may be sensitive to\nnon-Gaussian noise or outliers, leading to bias estimates of the latent\nfactors. In this paper, based on the maximum a posterior estimation, we derive\na robust orthogonal tensor CPD model with Cauchy loss, which is resistant to\nheavy-tailed noise or outliers. By exploring the half-quadratic property of the\nmodel, a new method, which is termed as half-quadratic alternating direction\nmethod of multipliers (HQ-ADMM), is proposed to solve the model. Each\nsubproblem involved in HQ-ADMM admits a closed-form solution.

Recently, there has been increasing\ninterest by governmental, legal and social institutions to enforce regulations,\nsuch as minimal and maximal work hours, on crowdworking platforms.

The goal of coded caching design is to minimize the\ntransmission rate and the subpacketization. In practice the demand for each\nuser is sensitive since one can get the other users' preferences when it gets\nthe other users' demands. The first coded caching scheme with private demands\nwas proposed by Wan et al. However the transmission rate and the\nsubpacketization of their scheme increase with the file number stored in the\nlibrary. In this paper we consider the following secure coded caching: prevent\nthe wiretappers from obtaining any information about the files in the server\nand protect the demands from all the users in the delivery phase. We firstly\nintroduce a combinatorial structure called secure placement delivery array\n(SPDA in short) to realize a coded caching scheme for our security setting.\nThen we obtain three classes of secure schemes by constructing SPDAs, where one\nof them is optimal. It is worth noting that the transmission rates and the\nsubpacketizations of our schemes are independent to the file number.\nFurthermore, comparing with the previously known schemes with the same security\nsetting, our schemes have significantly advantages on the subpacketizations and\nfor some parameters have the advantage on the transmission rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 May 2020 10:33:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-05"}

Such codes form the combinatorial backbone of\nPCPs. A major open problem is whether there exist LTCs with positive rate,\nconstant relative distance and testable with a constant number of queries.\n  In this paper, we present a new approach towards constructing such LTCs using\nthe machinery of high-dimensional expanders. To this end, we consider the\nTanner representation of a code, which is specified by a graph and a base code.\nInformally, our result states that if this graph is part of a high-dimensional\nexpander then the local testability of the code follows from the local\ntestability of the base code.\n  This work unifies and generalizes the known results on testability of the\nHadamard, Reed-Muller and lifted codes on the Subspace Complex, all of which\nare proved via local self correction. However, unlike previous results,\nconstant rounds of self correction do not suffice as the diameter of the\nunderlying test graph can be logarithmically large in a high-dimensional\nexpander and not constant as in all known earlier results. We overcome this\ntechnical hurdle by performing iterative self correction with logarithmically\nmany rounds and tightly controlling the error in each iteration using\nproperties of the high-dimensional expander.\n  Given this result, the missing ingredient towards constructing a\nconstant-query LTC with positive rate and constant relative distance is an\ninstantiation of a base code that interacts well with a constant-degree\nhigh-dimensional expander.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 May 2020 10:43:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-05"}

With no need for costly data labeling or\niterative learning, it performs model-free, label-free, and non-iterative BPDD\nin power grids from a new data-driven perspective of spatial-temporal nearest\nneighbor (STNN) discovery.

In this work (i) we argue\nthat said fragment, called AERPADPLUS, is unfortunately undecidable.\nNevertheless, by a careful re-encoding of the problem into a decidable\nrestriction of AERPADPLUS, (ii) we prove that the synthesis problem is\ndecidable in general and in N2EXP for several fixed omega-regular properties.\nFinally, (iii) we give a polynomial-space algorithm for the special case of the\nproblem where parameters can only be used in tests, and not updates, of the\ncounter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 May 2020 12:30:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2020 10:15:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 29 Jan 2021 11:16:52 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 29 Apr 2021 17:26:28 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 18 Oct 2021 12:34:30 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 2021 13:50:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-20"}

However, their Random Access CHannel (RACH)\nprocedure suffers from unreliability, due to the collision from the\nsimultaneous massive access. Despite that this collision problem has been\ntreated in existing RACH schemes, these schemes usually organize IoT devices'\ntransmission and re-transmission along with fixed parameters, thus can hardly\nadapt to time-varying traffic patterns. Without adaptation, the RACH procedure\neasily suffers from high access delay, high energy consumption, or even access\nunavailability. With the goal of improving the RACH procedure, this paper\ntargets to optimize the RACH procedure in real-time by maximizing a long-term\nhybrid multi-objective function, which consists of the number of access success\ndevices, the average energy consumption, and the average access delay. To do\nso, we first optimize the long-term objective in the number of access success\ndevices by using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms for different\nRACH schemes, including Access Class Barring (ACB), Back-Off (BO), and\nDistributed Queuing (DQ). The converging capability and efficiency of different\nDRL algorithms including Policy Gradient (PG), Actor-Critic (AC), Deep\nQ-Network (DQN), and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients (DDPG) are compared.\nInspired by the results from this comparison, a decoupled learning strategy is\ndeveloped to jointly and dynamically adapt the access control factors of those\nthree access schemes. This decoupled strategy first leverage a Recurrent Neural\nNetwork (RNN) model to predict the real-time traffic values of the network\nenvironment, and then uses multiple DRL agents to cooperatively configure\nparameters of each RACH scheme.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 May 2020 14:12:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-05"}

In the present paper, a temporal study of the\ndomestic U.S. ATN was performed based on annual flight data from 1996 to 2016\nand network analytics were used to examine the effects of restructuring that\nfollowed the 9/11 events along with the current state of the system. Centrality\nmeasures were computed to assess the system's topology and its global\nrobustness. A node deletion method was applied to assess the network's\ntolerance by simulating a targeted attack scenario. The study showed that the\n9/11 terrorist attacks triggered vast restructuring of the network, in terms of\nefficiency and security. Air traffic expanded, as new airports and air routes\nwere introduced. Airlines reconsidered their strategy and optimized their\noperations, thus allowing the network to recover rapidly and become even more\nefficient. Security concerns resulted in significant improvement of the\nnetwork's robustness. Since 2001, the global traffic and topological properties\nof the U.S. ATN have displayed continuous growth, due to the network's\nexpansion. On the other hand, the robustness of the system has not shown an\nimproving tendency.

More significantly, a transposed Poisson algebra naturally\narises from a Novikov-Poisson algebra by taking the commutator Lie algebra of\nthe Novikov algebra. Consequently, the classic construction of a Poisson\nalgebra from a commutative associative algebra with a pair of commuting\nderivations has a similar construction of a transposed Poisson algebra when\nthere is one derivation. More broadly, the transposed Poisson algebra also\ncaptures the algebraic structures when the commutator is taken in pre-Lie\nPoisson algebras and two other Poisson type algebras. Furthermore, the\ntransposed Poisson algebra improves two processes in~[17] that produce 3-Lie\nalgebras from Poisson algebras with a strongness condition.

Four forms of implementation of Smart Kids technology (Smart\nCase, Smart Teacher, Smart Class, and Smart Kids) were described con-sidering\nthe facilities of every school as well as the level of information and\ncommunication technology qualification of the elementary school teacher. The\naim of introduction of the technology for each form of teaching, the necessary\nequipment, and means for its implementation in elementary school environment\nwere determined. Based on the procedural approach to work of an elementary\nschool teacher, six stages of introduction of the technology were justified.\nSpe-cific aspects of introduction of blended teaching using the principles of\nSmart Kids technology were defined. The experience of introduction of\nelectronic textbooks to the system of elementary education of Ukraine was\ndescribed, the choice of electronic textbooks by elementary school teachers was\njustified, the comments and suggestions of teachers regarding the arrangement\nof electronic content in E-textbooks were summarized, the main approaches of\nteachers to the choice of an electronic textbook and development of their\ninformation and communication competence were specified. It was identified that\nthe forms, methods, and techniques of use of electronic textbooks in teaching\nelementary school pupils require further justification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 May 2020 10:25:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-18"}

The notion of \"system of computer modeling\", conceptual model of\nsystem of computer modeling (SCMod), its components (mathematical, animation,\ngraphic, strategic), functions, principles and purposes of use are grounded.\nThe features of the organization of students work using SCMod, individual and\ngroup work, the formation of subject competencies are described; the aspect of\nstudents' motivation to learning is considered. It is established that\neducational institutions can use SCMod at different levels and stages of\ntraining and in different contexts, which consist of interrelated physical,\nsocial, cultural and technological aspects. It is determined that the use of\nSCMod in general secondary school would increase the capacity of teachers to\nimprove the training of students in natural and mathematical subjects and\ncontribute to the individualization of the learning process, in order to meet\nthe pace, educational interests and capabilities of each particular student. It\nis substantiated that the use of SCMod in the study of natural-mathematical\nsubjects contributes to the formation of subject competencies, develops the\nskills of analysis and decision-making, increases the level of digital\ncommunication, develops vigilance, raises the level of knowledge, increases the\nduration of attention of students. Further research requires the justification\nof the process of forming students' competencies in natural-mathematical\nsubjects and designing cognitive tasks using SCMod.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 May 2020 10:26:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-18"}
