Reverse logistics (RL) activities\nplay an essential role in managing mobile phones during their end-of-life.\nHowever, remanufacturing and/or refurbishing of mobile phones might prove\ndifficult not only from an operational point of view but also from a data\nmanagement and privacy perspective (due to privacy-related regulatory\nframeworks like the EU General Data Protection Regulation directive). In this\npaper, we propose a distributed trustless and secure framework for electronic\nequipment RL activities based on blockchain technology. We consider the\nremanufacturing/refurbishing recovery option for mobile phones, and we develop\nan autonomous and effective back-end data sharing architecture based on smart\ncontracts/blockchain technology for keeping track of all the\nremanufacturing/refurbishing processes. For demonstrating the applicability of\nour approach, we develop a functional set of smart contracts and a local\nprivate blockchain. The benefits of our framework are further discussed, along\nwith fruitful areas for future research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 May 2020 16:11:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 26 May 2020 08:15:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-27"}

In the simplest problem of scattering in\none dimensional lattice, scattering due to an on-site potential and scattering\ndue to an unequal bond (in otherwise translationally invariant lattice) give\ndifferent results for scattering amplitudes. While the scattering problems in\nthe continuum and the lattice models can be mapped to one another for\nscattering due to on-site potential, the equivalent continuum model for\nscattering due to an unequal bond is missing. We introduce a new parameter $c$\nin the boundary condition of the continuum model that is equivalent to\nscattering due to an unequal bond on the lattice. Further, we study a junction\nbetween a normal metal quantum wire and a one dimensional edge of quantum spin\nHall insulator (QSHI) in continuum using the parameter $c$. In the case of a\njunction between a normal metal quantum wire and the edge of QSHI, we identify\nthe boundary condition that permits maximum transmission. Further, we solve the\nscattering problem between the junction of quantum wire and QSHI using a\nlattice model and map it to continuum model results. The problem of transport\nbetween four channels of spinful normal metal quantum wire and two channels of\nQSHI edge is not well-defined. We rectify this situation by formulating the\nscattering problem in terms of a junction of a semi-infinite normal metal\nquantum wire with an infinite edge of QSHI, gapping out one semi-infinite\nsection of the QSHI edge by a Zeeman field and applying an appropriate boundary\ncondition at the junction. We calculate the scattering amplitudes analytically.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 May 2020 16:16:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 10 Jul 2020 11:37:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 26 Jun 2022 06:14:41 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sun, 20 Nov 2022 08:43:14 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Thu, 15 Dec 2022 11:56:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-16"}

The research on the robustness of these models has also started\nto attract attentions in the machine learning field. However, most of the\nexisting work in this area focus on the GNNs for node-level tasks, while little\nwork has been done to study the robustness of the GNNs for the graph\nclassification task. In this paper, we aim to explore the vulnerability of the\nHierarchical Graph Pooling (HGP) Neural Networks, which are advanced GNNs that\nperform very well in the graph classification in terms of prediction accuracy.\nWe propose an adversarial attack framework for this task. Specifically, we\ndesign a surrogate model that consists of convolutional and pooling operators\nto generate adversarial samples to fool the hierarchical GNN-based graph\nclassification models. We set the preserved nodes by the pooling operator as\nour attack targets, and then we perturb the attack targets slightly to fool the\npooling operator in hierarchical GNNs so that they will select the wrong nodes\nto preserve. We show the adversarial samples generated from multiple datasets\nby our surrogate model have enough transferability to attack current\nstate-of-art graph classification models. Furthermore, we conduct the robust\ntrain on the target models and demonstrate that the retrained graph\nclassification models are able to better defend against the attack from the\nadversarial samples. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on\nthe adversarial attack against hierarchical GNN-based graph classification\nmodels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 May 2020 16:19:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-26"}

The variety of technologies has been based on placing a number of\nantennas at fixed locations which dictates the fundamental limit on the\nachievable performance. By contrast, this paper envisages the scenario where\nthe physical position of an antenna can be switched freely to one of the N\npositions over a fixed-length line space to pick up the strongest signal in the\nmanner of traditional selection combining.

We consider simultaneous outlier detection and\nrobust parameter estimation to minimize the effect of outlier contamination.\nRobust mixture regression has many important applications including in human\ncancer genomics data, where the population often displays strong heterogeneity\nadded by unwanted technological perturbations. Existing robust mixture\nregression methods suffer from outliers as they either conduct parameter\nestimation in the presence of outliers, or rely on prior knowledge of the level\nof outlier contamination. CAT was implemented in the framework of\nclassification expectation maximization, under which a natural definition of\noutliers could be derived.

In contrast, other Pareto-optimal solutions are less\nattractive since a small improvement on one objective can lead to a significant\ndegradation on at least one of the other objectives. In this paper, we propose\na simple and effective knee point identification method based on trade-off\nutility, dubbed KPITU, to help decision makers identify knee points from a\ngiven set of trade-off solutions. The basic idea of KPITU is to sequentially\nvalidate whether a solution is a knee point or not by comparing its trade-off\nutility with others within its neighbourhood. In particular, a solution is a\nknee point if and only if it has the best trade-off utility among its\nneighbours. Moreover, we implement a GPU version of KPITU that carries out the\nknee point identification in a parallel manner. This GPU version reduces the\nworst-case complexity from quadratic to linear. To validate the effectiveness\nof KPITU, we compare its performance with five state-of-the-art knee point\nidentification methods on 134 test problem instances. Empirical results fully\ndemonstrate the outstanding performance of KPITU especially on problems with\nmany local knee points. At the end, we further validate the usefulness of KPITU\nfor guiding EMO algorithms to search for knee points on the fly during the\nevolutionary process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 May 2020 21:05:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-26"}

Kinetic\nproofreading typically requires several dedicated structural features in the\nenzyme, such as a nucleotide hydrolysis site and multiple enzyme-substrate\nconformations that delay product formation. Such requirements limit the\napplicability and the adaptability of traditional proofreading schemes. Here,\nwe explore an alternative conceptual mechanism of error correction that\nachieves delays between substrate binding and subsequent product formation by\nhaving these events occur at distinct physical locations. The time taken by the\nenzyme-substrate complex to diffuse from one location to another is leveraged\nto discard wrong substrates. This mechanism does not require dedicated\nstructural elements on the enzyme, making it easier to overlook in experiments\nbut also making proofreading tunable on the fly. We discuss how tuning the\nlength scales of enzyme or substrate concentration gradients changes the\nfidelity, speed and energy dissipation, and quantify the performance\nlimitations imposed by realistic diffusion and reaction rates in the cell.

In this paper, we focus on\nRNN-based models and attempt to reformulate the way to incorporate RNN and its\nvariants into traffic prediction models. A stacked bidirectional and\nunidirectional LSTM network architecture (SBU-LSTM) is proposed to assist the\ndesign of neural network structures for traffic state forecasting. As a key\ncomponent of the architecture, the bidirectional LSTM (BDLSM) is exploited to\ncapture the forward and backward temporal dependencies in spatiotemporal data.\nTo deal with missing values in spatial-temporal data, we also propose a data\nimputation mechanism in the LSTM structure (LSTM-I) by designing an imputation\nunit to infer missing values and assist traffic prediction. The bidirectional\nversion of LSTM-I is incorporated in the SBU-LSTM architecture. Two real-world\nnetwork-wide traffic state datasets are used to conduct experiments and\npublished to facilitate further traffic prediction research.

However, directly\napplying existing style transfer approaches on videos, i.e., transferring the\nstyle of a video frame by frame, requires an extremely large amount of\ncomputation resources. It is still technically unaffordable to perform style\ntransfer of videos on mobile phones. To address this challenge, we propose\nMVStylizer, an efficient edge-assisted photorealistic video style transfer\nsystem for mobile phones. Instead of performing stylization frame by frame,\nonly key frames in the original video are processed by a pre-trained deep\nneural network (DNN) on edge servers, while the rest of stylized intermediate\nframes are generated by our designed optical-flow-based frame interpolation\nalgorithm on mobile phones. A meta-smoothing module is also proposed to\nsimultaneously upscale a stylized frame to arbitrary resolution and remove\nstyle transfer related distortions in these upscaled frames. In addition, for\nthe sake of continuously enhancing the performance of the DNN model on the edge\nserver, we adopt a federated learning scheme to keep retraining each DNN model\non the edge server with collected data from mobile clients and syncing with a\nglobal DNN model on the cloud server. Such a scheme effectively leverages the\ndiversity of collected data from various mobile clients and efficiently\nimproves the system performance.

A basic assumption behind multivariate time series forecasting is that\nits variables depend on one another but, upon looking closely, it is fair to\nsay that existing methods fail to fully exploit latent spatial dependencies\nbetween pairs of variables. In recent years, meanwhile, graph neural networks\n(GNNs) have shown high capability in handling relational dependencies. GNNs\nrequire well-defined graph structures for information propagation which means\nthey cannot be applied directly for multivariate time series where the\ndependencies are not known in advance. In this paper, we propose a general\ngraph neural network framework designed specifically for multivariate time\nseries data.

A novel mix-hop propagation\nlayer and a dilated inception layer are further proposed to capture the spatial\nand temporal dependencies within the time series.

Although non-categoricity has become ubiquitous in the second half\nof the 20th century whether one looks at number theory, geometry or analysis,\nthe first axiomatizations of such mathematical theories by Dedekind, Hilbert,\nHuntington, Peano and Veblen were indeed categorical. A common resolution of\nthe difference between the earlier categorical axiomatizations and the more\nmodern non-categorical axiomatizations is that the latter derive their\nnon-categoricity from Skolem's Paradox and G\\\"odel's Incompleteness Theorems,\nwhile the former, being second order, suffer from a heavy reliance on\nmetatheory, where the Skolem-G\\\"odel phenomenon re-emerges. Using second order\nmeta-theory to avoid non-categoricity of the meta-theory would only seem to\nlead to an infinite regress. In this paper we maintain that internal\ncategoricity breaks this traditional picture. It applies to both first and\nsecond order axiomatizations, although in the first order case we have so far\nonly examples. It does not depend on the meta-theory in a way that would lead\nto an infinite regress. And it covers the classical categoricity results of\nearly researchers. In the first order case it is weaker than categoricity\nitself, and in the second order case stronger. We give arguments suggesting\nthat internal categoricity is the \"right\" concept of categoricity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 May 2020 06:14:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-26"}

For a\nsubspace with a single axis, the optimization produces the principal\neigenvector of the data covariance matrix. Hierarchical learning rules with\ndeflation procedures can then be used to extract multiple eigenvectors.\nHowever, for a subspace with multiple axes, the optimization leads to PSA\nlearning rules which only converge to axes spanning the principal subspace but\nnot to the principal eigenvectors. A modified objective function with distinct\nweight factors had to be introduced produce PCA learning rules. Optimization of\nthe objective function for multiple axes leads to symmetric learning rules\nwhich do not require deflation procedures. For the PCA case, the estimated\nprincipal eigenvectors are ordered (w.r.t. the corresponding eigenvalues)\ndepending on the order of the weight factors.\n  Here we introduce an alternative objective function where it is not necessary\nto introduce fixed weight factors; instead, the alternative objective function\nuses squared summands.

This seems to be a general rule. However,\na recent numerical experiment shows that there exists a contradiction between\nthe Zipf exponent 1 and high urbanization level in a large population country.\nIn this paper, mathematical modeling, computational analysis, and the method of\nproof by contradiction are employed to reveal the numerical relationships\nbetween urbanization level and Zipf scaling exponent. The main findings are as\nfollows. (1) If Zipf scaling exponent equals 1, the urbanization rate of a\nlarge populous country can hardly exceed 50%. (2) If Zipf scaling exponent is\nless than 1, the urbanization level of large populous countries can exceeds\n80%. A conclusion can be drawn that the Zipf exponent is the control parameter\nfor the urbanization dynamics. In order to improve the urbanization level of\nlarge population countries, it is necessary to reduce the Zipf scaling\nexponent. Allometric growth law is employed to interpret the change of Zipf\nexponent, and scaling transform is employed to prove that different definitions\nof cities do no influence the above analytical conclusion essentially.

In this paper, we study the\nproblem of personalized video highlight recommendation with rich visual\ncontent. By dividing each video into non-overlapping segments, we formulate the\nproblem as a personalized segment recommendation task with many new segments in\nthe test stage. The key challenges of this problem lie in: the cold-start users\nwith limited video highlight records in the training data and new segments\nwithout any user ratings at the test stage. In this paper, we propose an\ninductive Graph based Transfer learning framework for personalized video\nhighlight Recommendation (TransGRec).

Within our framework, we design an algorithm satisfying\nthe more stringent setting of DP called local DP (LDP). To our knowledge, this\nis the first LDP algorithm for publishing streaming data. Using four real-world\ndatasets, we demonstrate that our mechanism outperforms the state-of-the-art by\na factor of 6-10 orders of magnitude in terms of utility (measured by the mean\nsquared error of answering a random range query).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 May 2020 14:25:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-26"}

It is well known\nthat neural networks are better at handling classification problems than\nregression problems. It is an extremely nonlinear process to let the network\noutput the angle value directly for optimization learning, and the weight\nconstraint of the loss function will be relatively weak. This paper proposes a\nnovel Bernoulli heatmap for head pose estimation from a single RGB image. Our\nmethod can achieve the positioning of the head area while estimating the angles\nof the head. The Bernoulli heatmap makes it possible to construct fully\nconvolutional neural networks without fully connected layers and provides a new\nidea for the output form of head pose estimation. A deep convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN) structure with multiscale representations is adopted to maintain\nhigh-resolution information and low-resolution information in parallel.

The\nSCRAMBLE could be used to lock an FSM by hiding its state transition graph\n(STG) among a large number of key-controlled false transitions. Also, it could\nbe used to lock sequential circuits (sequential datapath) by hiding the timing\npaths' connectivity among a large number of key-controlled false connections.\nBesides, the structure of SCRAMBLE allows us to engage this scheme as a new\nscan chain locking solution by hiding the correct scan chain sequence among a\nlarge number of the key-controlled false sequences. We demonstrate that the\nproposed scheme resists against both (1) the 2-stage attacks on FSM, and (2)\nSAT attacks integrated with unrolling as well as bounded-model-checking. We\nhave discussed two variants of SCRAMBLE: (I) Connectivity SCRAMBLE\n(SCRAMBLE-C), and (b) Logic SCRAMBLE (SCRAMBLE-L). The SCRAMBLE-C relies on the\nSAT-hard and key-controlled modules that are built using near non-blocking\nlogarithmic switching networks. The SCRAMBLE-L uses input multiplexing\ntechniques to hide a part of the FSM in a memory.

This\nflat-axicon optical element produces a needle-like axial intensity distribution\nwhich can be used for the optical pump pulse. The fs-X-ray free electron laser\n(X-FEL) beam of sub-1 micrometer diameter can be introduced through the central\nhole along the optical axis onto a target as a probe. Different realisations of\noptical pump are discussed. Such optical elements facilitate alignment of\nultra-short fs-pulses in space and time and can be used in light-matter\ninteraction experiments at extreme energy densities on the surface and in the\nvolume of targets. Full advantage of ultra-short 10 fs X-FEL probe pulses with\nfs-pump(optical) opens an unexplored temporal dimension of phase transitions\nand the fastest laser-induced rates of material heating and quenching. A wider\nfield of applications of fs-laser-enabled structuring of materials and design\nof specific optical elements for astrophotonics is presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 May 2020 05:28:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-01"}

Past work\nhas shown that domain knowledge, framed as constraints over the output space,\ncan help improve predictive accuracy. However, designing good constraints often\nrelies on domain expertise. In this paper, we study the problem of learning\nsuch constraints. We frame the problem as that of training a two-layer\nrectifier network to identify valid structures or substructures, and show a\nconstruction for converting a trained network into a system of linear\nconstraints over the inference variables. Our experiments on several NLP tasks\nshow that the learned constraints can improve the prediction accuracy,\nespecially when the number of training examples is small.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 May 2020 18:31:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-03"}

Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) is used to measure\nVOCs, but its application is limited by expert-driven data analysis that is\ntime-consuming, subjective and may introduce errors. We propose a system to\nperform GC-MS data analysis that exploits deep learning pattern recognition\nability to learn and automatically detect VOCs directly from raw data, thus\nbypassing expert-led processing. The new proposed approach showed to outperform\nthe expert-led analysis by detecting a significantly higher number of VOCs in\njust a fraction of time while maintaining high specificity. These results\nsuggest that the proposed method can help the large-scale deployment of\nbreath-based diagnosis by reducing time and cost, and increasing accuracy and\nconsistency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 May 2020 11:44:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-03"}

Line sections with less\ntraffic under normal operational conditions but with increased importance in\nthe case of disruptions are identified in the railway network of Hungary by\nusing a weighted directed graph. To describe the goodness of the individual\nalternative routes the so-called redundancy index is used. The results show\nthat the structure of the network is good, but the lines with the highest\nredundancy (lines No. 80, 2, 4 and 77 according to the numbering of the\nnational railway operator, M\\'AV) are mostly single tracked and in many cases\nthe line speed is low. The building of additional tracks and electrifying these\nlines while still maintaining the existing diesel locomotives for the case of\ndisruptions of the electric support are the keys to make the performance of the\nrather dense railway network of Hungary sustainable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 24 May 2020 07:42:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-05"}

While self-protections such as wearing mask,\nsheltering in place and quarantine polices and strategies are necessary for\ncontaining virus transmission, tens of millions people in the U.S. have lost\ntheir jobs due to the shutdown of businesses. Therefore, how to reopen the\neconomy safely while the virus is still circulating in population has become a\nproblem of significant concern and importance to elected leaders and business\nexecutives. In this study, mathematical modeling is employed to quantify the\nprofit generation and the infection risk simultaneously from the point of view\nof a business entity. Specifically, an ordinary differential equation model was\ndeveloped to characterize disease transmission and infection risk. An algebraic\nequation is proposed to determine the net profit that a business entity can\ngenerate after reopening and take into account the costs associated of several\nprotection/quarantine guidelines. All model parameters were calibrated based on\nvarious data and information sources. Sensitivity analyses and case studies\nwere performed to illustrate the use of the model in practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 May 2020 19:08:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2020 04:48:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-15"}
