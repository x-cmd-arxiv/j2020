The algorithm iteratively finds\nitems that are rarely recommended yet are high-quality and add them to the\nusers' final recommendation lists.

While we focus on aggregate\ndiversity and fair distribution of recommended items, the algorithm can be\nadapted to other recommendation scenarios using different underlying\ndefinitions of fairness.

Using daily notified COVID-19 cases from six\nstates (Maharashtra, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Uttar\nPradesh) and overall India, we estimated several important parameters of the\nmodel. Moreover, we provided an estimation of the basic ($R_{0}$), the\ncommunity ($R_{C}$), and the hospital ($R_{H}$) reproduction numbers for those\nseven locations.

Besides, it is expected that CR-enabled\nvehicular ad-hoc networks (CR-VANETs) enrich the communication performance of\nthe existing vehicular networks (VANETs). However, to ensure efficient\nperformance in a multi-hop communication, the routing protocol in CR-VANETs\nneeds to consider the autonomous mobility of the vehicles as well as the\nstochastic availability of the channels. Hence, this paper introduces a\nspectrum-aware mobility pattern based reactive routing protocol for CR-VANET.\nThe proposed protocol accommodates the dynamic behavior and selects a stable\ntransmission path from a source node to the destination. Therefore, the\nproposed protocol is outlined as a weighted graph problem where the weight for\nan edge is measured based on a parameter termed as NHDF (Next-hop Determination\nFactor). The NHDF implicitly considers mobility patterns of the nodes and\nchannel availability to select the optimum path for communication. Therefore,\nin the proposed routing protocol, the mobility pattern of a node is defined\nfrom the viewpoint of distance, speed, direction, and node's reliability.\nFurthermore, the spectrum awareness in the proposed protocol is measured over\nthe number of shared common channels and the channel quality. It is anticipated\nthat the proposed protocol shows efficient routing performance by selecting\nstable and secured paths from source to destination. Simulation is carried out\nto assess the performance of the protocol where it is witnessed that the\nproposed routing protocol outperforms existing ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 May 2020 20:06:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-05"}

To address the above issue, we propose a novel end-to-end deep\nlearning model, termed graph neural network with Neural Granger Causality\n(CauGNN) in this paper.

Whereas computers are carefully engineered to represent\nand perform mathematical operations on structured data, neurobiological systems\nperform analogous functions despite flexible organization and unstructured\nsensory input. Recent efforts have made progress in modeling the representation\nand recall of information in neural systems. However, precisely how neural\nsystems learn to modify these representations remains far from understood. Here\nwe demonstrate that a recurrent neural network (RNN) can learn to modify its\nrepresentation of complex information using only examples, and we explain the\nassociated learning mechanism with new theory. Specifically, we drive an RNN\nwith examples of translated, linearly transformed, or pre-bifurcated time\nseries from a chaotic Lorenz system, alongside an additional control signal\nthat changes value for each example. By training the network to replicate the\nLorenz inputs, it learns to autonomously evolve about a Lorenz-shaped manifold.\nAdditionally, it learns to continuously interpolate and extrapolate the\ntranslation, transformation, and bifurcation of this representation far beyond\nthe training data by changing the control signal. Finally, we provide a\nmechanism for how these computations are learned, and demonstrate that a single\nnetwork can simultaneously learn multiple computations.

Through\nnumerical simulations, we show that the proposed SO-PB-NLC technique\nsignificantly enhances the NLC performance and the maximum transmission reach\nwhen compared to the FO-PB-NLC technique. Then, the performance of the\nSO-PB-NLC technique is compared with that of the benchmark digital\nback-propagation (DBP).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 3 May 2020 21:14:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-05"}

The transient contact force applied by the\ncapsizing iceberg on the glacier front generates seismic waves that propagate\nover teleseismic distances. The inversion of this seismic signal is of great\ninterest to get insight into actual and past capsize dynamics. However, the\niceberg size, which is of interest for geophysical and climatic studies, cannot\nbe recovered from the seismic amplitude alone. This is because the capsize is a\ncomplex process involving interactions between the iceberg, the glacier and the\nsurrounding water. This paper presents a first step towards the construction of\na complete model, and is focused on the capsize in the open ocean without\nglacier front nor ice-m\\'elange. The capsize dynamics of an iceberg in the open\nocean is captured by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, which\nallows assessing the complexity of the fluid motion around a capsizing iceberg\nand how far the ocean is affected by iceberg rotation. Expressing the results\nin terms of appropriate dimensionless variables, we show that laboratory scale\nand field scale capsizes can be directly compared. The capsize dynamics is\nfound to be highly sensitive to the iceberg aspect ratio and to the water and\nice densities. However, dealing at the same time with the fluid dynamics and\nthe contact between the iceberg and the deformable glacier front requires\nhighly complex coupling that often goes beyond actual capabilities of\nfluid-structure interaction softwares. Therefore, we developed a\nsemi-analytical simplified fluid-structure model (SAFIM) that can be\nimplemented in solid mechanics computations dealing with contact dynamics of\ndeformable solids. This model accounts for hydrodynamic forces through\ncalibrated drag and added-mass effects, and is calibrated against the reference\nCFD simulations...\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 May 2020 00:34:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 17 Jun 2020 16:31:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-18"}

The quantized drift of Bloch\noscillations is determined by a one-dimensional time integral of the Berry\ncurvature, being effectively an integer multiple of the topological Chern\nnumber in the Thouless pumping. Our study offers a straightforward approach to\nyield quantized pumping, and it is useful for probing topological phase\ntransitions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 May 2020 01:10:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 May 2020 02:40:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 18 Jun 2020 01:58:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-05"}

Existing procedures to defend\nagainst such perturbations are either (i) heuristic in nature and susceptible\nto stronger attacks or (ii) provide guaranteed robustness to worst-case\nattacks, but are incompatible with state-of-the-art models like BERT. In this\nwork, we introduce robust encodings (RobEn): a simple framework that confers\nguaranteed robustness, without making compromises on model architecture. The\ncore component of RobEn is an encoding function, which maps sentences to a\nsmaller, discrete space of encodings. Systems using these encodings as a\nbottleneck confer guaranteed robustness with standard training, and the same\nencodings can be used across multiple tasks. We identify two desiderata to\nconstruct robust encoding functions: perturbations of a sentence should map to\na small set of encodings (stability), and models using encodings should still\nperform well (fidelity). We instantiate RobEn to defend against a large family\nof adversarial typos. Across six tasks from GLUE, our instantiation of RobEn\npaired with BERT achieves an average robust accuracy of 71.3% against all\nadversarial typos in the family considered, while previous work using a\ntypo-corrector achieves only 35.3% accuracy against a simple greedy attack.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 May 2020 01:28:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-05"}

It is challenging for modern deep\nneural networks that typically require hundreds or thousands of images per\nclass. In this paper, we adopt metric learning for this problem, which has been\napplied for few- and many-shot image classification by comparing the distance\nbetween the test image and the center of each class in the feature space.\nHowever, for one-shot learning, the existing metric learning approaches would\nsuffer poor performance because the single training image may not be\nrepresentative of the class. For example, if the image is far away from the\nclass center in the feature space, the metric-learning based algorithms are\nunlikely to make correct predictions for the test images because the decision\nboundary is shifted by this noisy image. To address this issue, we propose a\nsimple yet effective regression model, denoted by RestoreNet, which learns a\nclass agnostic transformation on the image feature to move the image closer to\nthe class center in the feature space. Experiments demonstrate that RestoreNet\nobtains superior performance over the state-of-the-art methods on a broad range\nof datasets. Moreover, RestoreNet can be easily combined with other methods to\nachieve further improvement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 May 2020 02:11:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-05"}

This paper introduces three new mixed ramp-Gaussian basis\nsets - STO-R, STO-RG and STO-R2G, made from a linear combination of ramp and\nGaussian primitive functions - which are derived from the single-core-zeta\nSlater basis sets for the elements Li to Ne.

In recommender systems for\ninstance, the action is to choose what to recommend, and the optimization task\nis to recommend items the user prefers. The optimization is done based on\nearlier user's feedback (e.g. \"likes\" and \"dislikes\"), and the algorithms\nassume the feedback to be faithful. That is, when the user clicks \"like,\" they\nactually prefer the item. We argue that this fundamental assumption can be\nextensively violated by human users, who are not passive feedback sources.\nInstead, they are in control, actively steering the system towards their goal.\nTo verify this hypothesis, that humans steer and are able to improve\nperformance by steering, we designed a function optimization task where a human\nand an optimization algorithm collaborate to find the maximum of a\n1-dimensional function. At each iteration, the optimization algorithm queries\nthe user for the value of a hidden function $f$ at a point $x$, and the user,\nwho sees the hidden function, provides an answer about $f(x)$. Our study on 21\nparticipants shows that users who understand how the optimization works,\nstrategically provide biased answers (answers not equal to $f(x)$), which\nresults in the algorithm finding the optimum significantly faster.

However, different from\nconventional terrestrial communication systems, UAVs typically have rather\nlimited onboard energy on one hand, and require additional flying energy\nconsumption on the other hand, which renders energy-efficient UAV communication\nwith smart energy expenditure of paramount importance. In this paper, via\nextensive flight experiments, we aim to firstly validate the recently derived\ntheoretical energy model for rotary-wing UAVs, and then develop a general model\nfor those complicated flight scenarios where rigorous theoretical model\nderivation is quite challenging, if not impossible. Specifically, we first\ninvestigate how UAV power consumption varies with its flying speed for the\nsimplest straight-and-level flight. With about 12,000 valid power-speed data\npoints collected, we first apply the model-based curve fitting to obtain the\nmodelling parameters based on the theoretical closed-form energy model in the\nexisting literature. In addition, in order to exclude the potential bias caused\nby the theoretical energy model, the obtained measurement data is also trained\nusing a model-free deep neural network. It is found that the obtained curve\nfrom both methods can match quite well with the theoretical energy model. Next,\nwe further extend the study to arbitrary 2-dimensional (2-D) flight, where, to\nour best knowledge, no rigorous theoretical derivation is available for the\nclosed-form energy model as a function of its flying speed, direction, and\nacceleration. To fill the gap, we first propose a heuristic energy model for\nthese more complicated cases, and then provide experimental validation based on\nthe measurement results for circular level flight.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 May 2020 07:32:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-05"}

For any decision problem\n$f$, the minimum complexity of a span program for $f$ is equal, up to a\nconstant factor, to the quantum query complexity of $f$. Moreover, this\ncorrespondence is constructive. A span program for $f$ with complexity $C$ can\nbe compiled into a bounded error quantum algorithm for $f$ with query\ncomplexity $O(C)$, and vice versa.\n  In this work, we prove an analogous connection for quantum time complexity.\nIn particular, we show how to convert a quantum algorithm for $f$ with time\ncomplexity $T$ into a span program for $f$ such that it compiles back into a\nquantum algorithm for $f$ with time complexity $\\widetilde{O}(T)$. While the\nquery complexity of quantum algorithms obtained from span programs is\nwell-understood, it is not generally clear how to implement certain\nquery-independent operations in a time-efficient manner. We show that for span\nprograms derived from algorithms with a time-efficient implementation, we can\npreserve the time efficiency when implementing the span program. This means in\nparticular that span programs not only fully capture quantum query complexity,\nbut also quantum time complexity.\n  One practical advantage of being able to convert quantum algorithms to span\nprograms in a way that preserves time complexity is that span programs compose\nvery nicely. We demonstrate this by improving Ambainis's variable-time quantum\nsearch result using our construction through a span program composition for the\nOR function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 May 2020 08:43:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-14"}

Specifically, based on the convolutional\ndictionary learning mechanism for representing rain, we propose a novel single\nimage deraining model and utilize the proximal gradient descent technique to\ndesign an iterative algorithm only containing simple operators for solving the\nmodel. Such a simple implementation scheme facilitates us to unfold it into a\nnew deep network architecture, called rain convolutional dictionary network\n(RCDNet), with almost every network module one-to-one corresponding to each\noperation involved in the algorithm.

We hypothesized that a reduced function of NMDA receptors is involved\nin the spindle deficit observed in schizophrenia. Methods: An\nelectrophysiological multisite cell-to-network exploration was used to\ninvestigate, in pentobarbital-sedated rats, the effects of a single\npsychotomimetic dose of the NMDA glutamate receptor antagonist ketamine in the\nsensorimotor and associative/cognitive thalamocortical (TC) systems. Results:\nUnder the control condition, spontaneously-occurring spindles (intra-frequency:\n10-16 waves/s) and delta-frequency (1-4Hz) oscillations were recorded in the\nfrontoparietal cortical EEG, in thalamic extracellular recordings, in dual\njuxtacellularly recorded GABAergic thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) and\nglutamatergic TC neurons, and in intracellularly recorded TC neurons. The TRN\ncells rhythmically exhibited robust high-frequency bursts of action potentials\n(7 to 15 APs at 200-700Hz). A single administration of low-dose ketamine\nfleetingly reduced TC spindles and delta oscillations, amplified ongoing\ngamma-(30-80Hz) and higher-frequency oscillations, and switched the firing\npattern of both TC and TRN neurons from a burst mode to a single AP mode.\nFurthermore, ketamine strengthened the gamma-frequency band TRN-TC\nconnectivity. The antipsychotic clozapine consistently prevented the ketamine\neffects on spindles, delta- and gamma-/higher-frequency TC oscillations.\nConclusion: The present findings support the hypothesis that NMDA receptor\nhypofunction is involved in the reduction in sleep spindles and delta\noscillations. The ketamine-induced swift conversion of ongoing TC-TRN\nactivities may have involved at least both the ascending reticular activating\nsystem and the corticothalamic pathway.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 May 2020 09:57:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-05"}

The violation index\nterm is proposed to quantize the non adoption of social distancing protocol.\nFrom the experimental analysis, it is observed that the YOLO v3 with Deepsort\ntracking scheme displayed best results with balanced mAP and FPS score to\nmonitor the social distancing in real-time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 May 2020 10:58:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 May 2020 17:47:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 24 Apr 2021 16:15:26 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 27 Apr 2021 05:08:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-28"}

We\nanalyse two solar flares (SOL2013-02-17 and SOL2013-11-05) observed by the\nPOlarisation Emission of Millimetre Activity at the Sun (POEMAS) at 45 and 90\nGHz, at microwaves from 1 - 15 GHz by the Radio Solar Telescope Network (RSTN),\nand at high frequencies (212 GHz) by the Solar Submillimetre Telescope (SST).\nAlso, hard X-rays from these flares were simultaneously detected by the Reuven\nRamaty High-Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI). The flux and\npolarisation radio spectra were fit using a model that simulates\ngyrosynchrotron emission in a spatially-varying 3D magnetic field loop\nstructure. For the {modelling}, the magnetic loop geometry was fixed and the\nfield strength was the only free parameter of the magnetic field. In addition,\na uniform electron distribution was {assumed by} the model, with the number\ndensity of energetic electrons and the electron spectral index as free\nparameters. The fitted model reproduced reasonably well the observed degree of\npolarisation and radio flux spectra for each event yielding the physical\nparameters of the loop and flaring sources. Our results indicate that the high\ndegree of polarisation during a solar flare can be explained by two sources\nlocated at the {footpoints} of highly asymmetric magnetic loops whereas low\npolarisation degrees arise from footpoint sources of symmetric magnetic loops.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 May 2020 12:20:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-05"}

We seek to perform a complete\ntransit search on the ultracool dwarfs observed by NASA's K2 mission to\nconstrain the occurrence rate of planets around these stars. We filter and\ncharacterise the sample of ultracool dwarfs observed by K2, by fitting their\nspectral energy distributions and using parallaxes from Gaia. We build an\nautomatic pipeline to perform photometry, detrend the lightcurves, and search\nfor transits. Using extensive injection-recovery tests of our pipeline, we\ncompute the detection sensitivity of our search, and thus the completeness of\nour sample. We infer the planetary occurrence rates within a hierarchical\nBayesian model (HBM) to treat uncertain planetary parameters. With the\noccurrence rate parametrised by a step-wise function, we show a convenient way\nto directly marginalise over the second level of our HBM (the planet\nparameters). Our method is applicable generally and can greatly speed up\ninference with larger catalogues of detected planets. We detect one planet in\nour sample of 702 ultracool dwarfs: a previously-validated mini-Neptune. We\nthus infer a mini-Neptune (2 - 4Re) occurrence rate of {\\eta} = 0.20+0.16-0.11\nwithin orbital periods of 1 - 20 days. For super-Earths (1 - 2Re) and ice/gas\ngiants (4 - 6Re) within 1 - 20 days, we place 95% credible intervals of {\\eta}\n< 1.14 and {\\eta} < 0.29, respectively. If TRAPPIST-1-like systems were\nubiquitous, we would have had a 96% chance of finding at least one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 May 2020 12:52:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-30"}

We used the VULCAN chemical kinetic code to\ncompute number densities of species. The temperature-pressure profile of the\natmosphere was computed with the HELIOS code. We also utilized the $\\tau$-ReX\nforward model to predict the spectra of planets in primary and secondary\neclipses. In order to account for the stellar activity we made use of the\nobserved solar XUV spectrum taken from Virtual Planetary Laboratory (VPL) as a\nproxy for an active sun-like star. We find large changes in mixing ratios of\nmost chemical species in planets orbiting A-type stars that radiate strong XUV\nflux inducing a very effective photodissociation. For some species, these\nchanges can propagate very deep into the planetary atmosphere to pressures of\naround 1 bar. To observe disequilibrium chemistry we favor hot Jupiters with\ntemperatures Teq=1000 K and ultra-hot Jupiters with Teq=3000$ K that also have\ntemperature inversion in their atmospheres. On the other hand, disequilibrium\ncalculations predict little changes in spectra of planets with intermediate\ntemperatures. We also show that stellar activity similar to the one of the\nmodern Sun drives important changes in mixing ratio profiles of atmospheric\nspecies. However, these changes take place at very high atmospheric altitudes\nand thus do not affect predicted spectra. We estimate that the effect of\ndisequilibrium chemistry in planets orbiting nearby bright stars could be\nrobustly detected and studied with future missions with spectroscopic\ncapabilities in infrared such as, e.g., JWST and ARIEL.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 May 2020 13:26:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-08"}

Combining the Navier-Stokes equations\nand the spin diffusion equation in the presence of the spin-vorticity coupling,\nwe derive an expression for the spin accumulation emerging purely as a result\nof the viscous electron flow. We explore Poiseuille flow and Jeffery-Hamel flow\nand show that the spin Hall angle may exceed 0.1 over a wide range of\ntemperatures and can be controlled by carrier density, temperature, and the\ngeometry of sample boundaries. Our theory points to new functionality of\ngraphene as a spin current source.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 May 2020 13:52:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-05"}

Recently, connections with\nvariational approaches have led to the derivation of new learning algorithms\nwith accelerated learning guarantees.

There is a significant need for\nparameter update algorithms which can be proven stable in the presence of\nadversarial time-varying regressors, as is commonplace in control theory. In\nthis paper, we propose a new discrete time algorithm which 1) provides\nstability and asymptotic convergence guarantees in the presence of adversarial\nregressors by leveraging insights from adaptive control theory and 2) provides\nnon-asymptotic accelerated learning guarantees leveraging insights from convex\noptimization.

However, these structures are often very faint\ncompared to their host galaxy, and spectroscopic analysis of NSCs is hampered\nby contamination of light from the rest of the system. With the introduction of\nwide-field IFU spectrographs, new techniques have been developed to model the\nlight from different components within galaxies, making it possible to cleanly\nextract the spectra of the NSCs and study their properties with minimal\ncontamination from the light of the rest of the galaxy. This work presents the\nanalysis of the NSCs in a sample of 12 dwarf galaxies in the Fornax Cluster\nobserved with MUSE. Analysis of the stellar populations and star-formation\nhistories reveal that all the NSCs show evidence of multiple episodes of star\nformation, indicating that they have built up their mass further since their\ninitial formation. The NSCs were found to have systematically lower\nmetallicities than their host galaxies, which is consistent with a scenario for\nmass-assembly through mergers with infalling globular clusters, while the\npresence of younger stellar populations and gas emission in the core of two\ngalaxies is indicative of in-situ star formation. We conclude that the NSCs in\nthese dwarf galaxies likely originated as globular clusters that migrated to\nthe core of the galaxy which have built up their mass mainly through mergers\nwith other infalling clusters, with gas-inflow leading to in-situ star\nformation playing a secondary role.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 May 2020 14:44:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-20"}

We present a two-part framework for recovering\nthe shape of the obstacle. In part 1, we introduce an algorithm to find the\naxis of symmetry of the obstacle by making use of the far field pattern. In\npart 2, we recover the shape of the obstacle by applying the recursive\nlinearization algorithm (RLA) with multifrequency measurements of the scattered\nfield. In the RLA, a sequence of inverse scattering problems using increasing\nsingle frequency measurements are solved. Each of those problems is ill-posed\nand nonlinear. The ill-posedness is treated by using a band-limited\nrepresentation for the shape of the obstacle, while the nonlinearity is dealt\nwith by applying the damped Gauss-Newton method. When using the RLA, a large\nnumber of forward scattering problems must be solved. Hence, it is paramount to\nhave an efficient and accurate forward problem solver. For the forward problem,\nwe apply separation of variables in the azimuthal coordinate and Fourier\ndecompose the resulting problem, leaving us with a sequence of decoupled\nsimpler forward scattering problems to solve.

However, such adoption brings\nsubstantial challenges that need to be recognized and confronted. Here, we\ndiscuss both opportunities and roadblocks to implementation of deep learning\nwithin materials science, focusing on the relationship between correlative\nnature of machine learning and causal hypothesis driven nature of physical\nsciences. We argue that deep learning and AI are now well positioned to\nrevolutionize fields where causal links are known, as is the case for\napplications in theory. When confounding factors are frozen or change only\nweakly, this leaves open the pathway for effective deep learning solutions in\nexperimental domains. Similarly, these methods offer a pathway towards\nunderstanding the physics of real-world systems, either via deriving reduced\nrepresentations, deducing algorithmic complexity, or recovering generative\nphysical models. However, extending deep learning and \"AI\" for models with\nunclear causal relationship can produce misleading and potentially incorrect\nresults.

The very peculiar\nstructural distribution of five different types of cones in the retina\nunderlies this exquisite ability to sample light. It was recently found that\neach cone population as well as their total population display a disordered\npattern in which long wave-length density fluctuations vanish. This property,\nknown as hyperuniformity is also present in perfect crystals. In situations\nlike the avian retina in which both the global structure and that of each\ncomponent display hyperuniformity, the system is said to be multi-hyperuniform.\nIn this work, we aim at devising a minimal statistical-mechanical model that\ncan reproduce the main features of the spatial distribution of photoreceptors\nin avian retina, namely the presence of disorder, multi-hyperuniformity and\nlocal hetero-coordination. This last feature is key to avoid local clustering\nof the same type of photoreceptors, an undesirable feature for the efficient\nsampling of light. For this purpose we formulate a simple model that\ndefinitively exhibits the required structural properties, namely an equimolar\nthree-component mixture (one component to sample each primary color, red,\ngreen, and blue) of non-additive hard disks to which a long-range logarithmic\nrepulsion is added between like particles. A Voronoi analysis of our idealized\nsystem of photoreceptors shows that the space-filling Voronoi polygons\ninterestingly display a rather uniform area distribution, symmetrically\ncentered around that of a regular lattice, a structural property also found in\nhuman retina. Disordered multi-hyperuniformity offers an alternative to\ngenerate photoreceptor patterns with minimal long-range concentration and\ndensity fluctuations. This is the key to overcome the difficulties in devising\nan efficient visual system in which crystal-like order is absent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 May 2020 15:17:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-22"}

Stacking (also called \"stacked generalization\") is an\nensemble method that combines heterogeneous base models, arranged in at least\none layer, and then employs another metamodel to summarize the predictions of\nthose models. Although it may be a highly-effective approach for increasing the\npredictive performance of ML, generating a stack of models from scratch can be\na cumbersome trial-and-error process. This challenge stems from the enormous\nspace of available solutions, with different sets of data instances and\nfeatures that could be used for training, several algorithms to choose from,\nand instantiations of these algorithms using diverse parameters (i.e., models)\nthat perform differently according to various metrics. In this work, we present\na knowledge generation model, which supports ensemble learning with the use of\nvisualization, and a visual analytics system for stacked generalization. Our\nsystem, StackGenVis, assists users in dynamically adapting performance metrics,\nmanaging data instances, selecting the most important features for a given data\nset, choosing a set of top-performant and diverse algorithms, and measuring the\npredictive performance.

We find that the optical response is separated into several\ndistinct regions as a function of frequency, each dominated by different types\nof quasiparticles. The low-frequency intraband response is captured by a narrow\nDrude peak from a high-mobility electron pocket of double Weyl quasi-particles,\nand the temperature dependence of the spectral weight is consistent with its\nFermi velocity. By subtracting the low-frequency sharp Drude and phonon peaks\nat low temperatures, we reveal two intermediate quasi-linear inter-band\ncontributions separated by a kink at 0.2 eV. Using Wannier tight-binding models\nbased on first-principle calculations, we link the optical conductivity above\nand below 0.2 eV to interband transitions near the double Weyl fermion and a\nthreefold fermion, respectively. We analyze and determine the chemical\npotential relative to the energy of the threefold fermion, revealing the\nimportance of transitions between a linearly dispersing band and a flat band.\nMore strikingly, below 0.1 eV our data are best explained if spin-orbit\ncoupling is included, suggesting that at these energies the optical response is\ngoverned by transitions between a previously unobserved four-fold spin-3/2 node\nand a Weyl node.

Conceptually, the well-known alternating direction method of\nmultipliers (ADMM) can be directly applied to such a problem. An attractive\nadvantage of this direct ADMM application is that the control constraint can be\nuntied from the parabolic PDE constraint; these two inherently different\nconstraints thus can be treated individually in iterations. At each iteration\nof the ADMM, the main computation is for solving an unconstrained parabolic\noptimal control problem. Because of its high dimensionality after\ndiscretization, the unconstrained parabolic optimal control problem at each\niteration can be solved only inexactly by implementing certain numerical scheme\ninternally and thus a two-layer nested iterative scheme is required. It then\nbecomes important to find an easily implementable and efficient inexactness\ncriterion to execute the internal iterations, and to prove the overall\nconvergence rigorously for the resulting two-layer nested iterative scheme. To\nimplement the ADMM efficiently, we propose an inexactness criterion that is\nindependent of the mesh size of the involved discretization, and it can be\nexecuted automatically with no need to set empirically perceived constant\naccuracy a prior. The inexactness criterion turns out to allow us to solve the\nresulting unconstrained optimal control problems to medium or even low accuracy\nand thus saves computation significantly, yet convergence of the overall\ntwo-layer nested iterative scheme can be still guaranteed rigorously.\nEfficiency of this ADMM implementation is promisingly validated by preliminary\nnumerical results. Our methodology can also be extended to a range of optimal\ncontrol problems constrained by other linear PDEs such as elliptic equations\nand hyperbolic equations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 May 2020 15:50:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-05"}

In this framework, dealing with\ndeterministic and increasing operators, a dilation (respectively an erosion) is\nan operation which is distributive over supremum (respectively infimum). From\nthis simple definition of dilation and erosion, we cannot say much about the\nproperties of them. However, when they form an adjunction, many important\nproperties can be derived such as monotonicity, idempotence, and extensivity or\nanti-extensivity of their composition, preservation of infimum and supremum,\netc. Mathematical morphology has been first developed in the setting of sets,\nand then extended to other algebraic structures such as graphs, hypergraphs or\nsimplicial complexes. For all these algebraic structures, erosion and dilation\nare usually based on structuring elements. The goal is then to match these\nstructuring elements on given objects either to dilate or erode them. One of\nthe advantages of defining erosion and dilation based on structuring elements\nis that these operations are adjoint. Based on this observation, this paper\nproposes to define, at the abstract level of category theory, erosion and\ndilation based on structuring elements. We then define the notion of\nmorpho-category on which erosion and dilation are defined. We then show that\ntopos and more precisely topos of presheaves are good candidates to generate\nmorpho-categories. However, topos do not allow taking into account the notion\nof inclusion between substructures but rather are defined by monics up to\ndomain isomorphism. Therefore we define the notion of morpholizable category\nwhich allows generating morpho-categories where substructures are defined along\ninclusion morphisms. {A direct application of this framework is to generalize\nmodal morpho-logic to other algebraic structures than simple sets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 May 2020 15:11:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-06"}

Nevertheless, this approach is not properly an\ninverse scattering solution since the method only circumvents the problem to\nfit the equation of state (EoS) parameters (model-dependent) by replacing it\nwith their fit of its cosmographic parameters (with a polynomial\nseries-dependence). Therefore, can we construct a new cosmography approach\nwhere the cosmodynamical parameters can be fitted and then employ them to\nanalyse the kinematics via its generic cosmographic parameters? By all means,\nwithout experimenting the problem of truncation of the series that all\ncosmography proposals in the literature argue. In this work we present a\ngeneric EoS depending solely on the form of $f_i(z)$ and its derivative is\nfound, where this function can be any polynomial (mimicking a dark energy-like\nterm) that allow the dynamics of a specific cosmological density. We test our\ngeneric EoS with standard cosmological models and with polynomials proposals as\nPad\\'e and Chebyshev approximants. Interesting enough, a Pad\\'e (2,2)\napproximant has been considered inside a $f(z)$CDM-like model showing a\ntransition in $z=1$.

Bayesian\nOptimization (BO) invests a lot of computation time to generate the candidate\nsolution that best balances the predicted value and the uncertainty given all\nprevious data, taking increasingly more time as the number of evaluations\nperformed grows. Evolutionary Algorithms (EA) on the other hand rely on search\nheuristics that typically do not depend on all previous data and can be done in\nconstant time. Both the BO and EA community typically assess their performance\nas a function of the number of evaluations. However, this is unfair once we\nstart to compare the efficiency of these classes of algorithms, as the overhead\ntimes to generate candidate solutions are significantly different. We suggest\nto measure the efficiency of generate-and-test search algorithms as the\nexpected gain in the objective value per unit of computation time spent. We\nobserve that the preference of an algorithm to be used can change after a\nnumber of function evaluations. We therefore propose a new algorithm, a\ncombination of Bayesian optimization and an Evolutionary Algorithm, BEA for\nshort, that starts with BO, then transfers knowledge to an EA, and subsequently\nruns the EA. We compare the BEA with BO and the EA. The results show that BEA\noutperforms both BO and the EA in terms of time efficiency, and ultimately\nleads to better performance on well-known benchmark objective functions with\nmany local optima. Moreover, we test the three algorithms on nine test cases of\nrobot learning problems and here again we find that BEA outperforms the other\nalgorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 May 2020 15:29:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-11"}

In\nthis study, we proposed an end-to-end automatic sleep staging framework based\non optimal spectral-temporal sleep features using a sleep-edf dataset. The\ninput data were modified using a bandpass filter and then applied to a\nconvolutional neural network model.

Existing attempts to reconcile these contradictions compromise on\ncore qualities of the blockchain paradigm, as they include backdoor-like\napproaches such as central authorities with elevated rights or usage of\nspecialized chameleon hash algorithms in chaining of the blocks. In this\ntechnical report, we outline a novel architecture for the blockchain ledger and\nconsensus, which uses a tree of context chains with simultaneous validity. A\ncontext chain captures the transactions of a closed group of entities and\npersons, thus structuring blocks in a precisely defined way. The resulting\ncontext isolation enables consensus-steered deletion of an entire context\nwithout side effects to other contextes. This architecture opens the\npossibility of truncation, data rollover and separation of concerns, and can\nhelp to fulfill the GDPR regulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 May 2020 12:18:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-14"}

This is\nbecause the objective functions used by these methods do not explicitly aim to\nfind cluster trends in time, so these trends may not be clearly represented in\nthe results. This paper presents `DETECT' (Detection of Educational Trends\nElicited by Clustering Time-series data), a novel divisive hierarchical\nclustering algorithm that incorporates temporal information into its objective\nfunction to prioritise the detection of behavioural trends. The resulting\nclusters are similar in structure to a decision tree, with a hierarchy of\nclusters defined by decision rules on features. DETECT is easy to apply, highly\ncustomisable, applicable to a wide range of educational datasets and yields\neasily interpretable results. Through a case study of two online programming\ncourses (N>600), this paper demonstrates two example applications of DETECT: 1)\nto identify how cohort behaviour develops over time and 2) to identify student\nbehaviours that characterise exercises where many students give up.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 May 2020 01:34:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-08"}
