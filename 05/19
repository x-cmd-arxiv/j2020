Ideally, the GW detection\nand localization must be reported early enough to allow for telescopes to slew\nto the location of the GW-event before the onset of the counterpart. However,\nthe time available for early warning is limited by the short duration spent by\nthe dominant ($\\ell = m = 2$) mode within the detector's frequency band.\nNevertheless, we show that, including higher modes - which enter the detector's\nsensitivity band well before the dominant mode - in GW searches, can enable us\nto significantly improve the early warning ability for compact binaries with\nasymmetric masses (such as neutron-star-black-hole binaries). We investigate\nthe reduction in the localization sky-area when the $\\ell = m = 3$ and $\\ell =\nm = 4$ modes are included in addition to the dominant mode, considering typical\nslew-times of electromagnetic telescopes ($30-60$ sec).

A majority of recent\ndiscoveries of imaged giant planets have been obtained around young, early-type\nstars hosting a circumstellar disk. In this context, we have carried out a\ndirect imaging program designed to maximize our chances of giant planet\ndiscovery and targeting twenty-two young, early-type stars.

In particular, we propose a cost function by\nwhose minimization both of the cited requirements are taken into account in the\ncourse of a target assignment process. The applied simulations manifest the\nimprovement of convergence rates using our optimal approach. We show that our\nalgorithm scales the solution in quadratic time in the case of full\nobservations. Additionally, the convergence time and the percentage of the\ncolliding scenarios are also decreased in both supervisory and hybrid\ncoordination strategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 May 2020 16:26:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-25"}

Further, these applications often\ninvolve data that are either inherently gathered at geographically distributed\nentities or that are intentionally distributed across multiple machines for\nmemory, computational, and/or privacy reasons. Training of models in this\ndistributed, streaming setting requires solving stochastic optimization\nproblems in a collaborative manner over communication links between the\nphysical entities. When the streaming data rate is high compared to the\nprocessing capabilities of compute nodes and/or the rate of the communications\nlinks, this poses a challenging question: how can one best leverage the\nincoming data for distributed training under constraints on computing\ncapabilities and/or communications rate? A large body of research has emerged\nin recent decades to tackle this and related problems. This paper reviews\nrecently developed methods that focus on large-scale distributed stochastic\noptimization in the compute- and bandwidth-limited regime, with an emphasis on\nconvergence analysis that explicitly accounts for the mismatch between\ncomputation, communication and streaming rates. In particular, it focuses on\nmethods that solve: (i) distributed stochastic convex problems, and (ii)\ndistributed principal component analysis, which is a nonconvex problem with\ngeometric structure that permits global convergence. For such methods, the\npaper discusses recent advances in terms of distributed algorithmic designs\nwhen faced with high-rate streaming data. Further, it reviews guarantees\nunderlying these methods, which show there exist regimes in which systems can\nlearn from distributed, streaming data at order-optimal rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 May 2020 16:28:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 23:48:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-01"}

Here, we propose that photochemical\nhaze formed in vigorously mixing atmospheres can explain such super-Rayleigh\nslopes. We first analytically show that the spectral slope can be steepened by\nthe vertical opacity gradient in which atmospheric opacity increases with\naltitude. Using a microphysical model, we demonstrate that such opacity\ngradient can be naturally generated by photochemical haze, especially when the\neddy mixing is substantially efficient. The transmission spectra of hazy\natmospheres can be demarcated into four typical regimes in terms of the haze\nmass flux and eddy diffusion coefficient. We find that the transmission\nspectrum can have the spectral slope 2--4 times steeper than the Rayleigh slope\nif the eddy diffusion coefficient is sufficiently high and the haze mass flux\nfalls into a moderate value. Based on the eddy diffusion coefficient suggested\nby a recent study of atmospheric circulations, we suggest that photochemical\nhaze preferentially generates super-Rayleigh slopes at planets with equilibrium\ntemperature of 1000--1500 K, which might be consistent with results of recent\nretrieval studies.

The observations, allowing to measure\ndirectly the full phase space of the system, are accurately modeled by coupled\nperiodically forced Duffing resonators thanks to a complete calibration of the\nexperimental parameters. This shows that, besides chaos transfer from the\nmechanical to the optical frequency domain, spatial chaos transfer between the\ntwo nonidentical subsystems occurs.

We use higher rank expected signatures to embed\nadapted processes into graded linear spaces and show that these embeddings\ninduce the adapted topologies of Hoover--Keisler.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 May 2020 17:16:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Apr 2021 16:12:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-14"}

A\npopular approach in practice is to factorize the matrix into two compact\nlow-rank factors, and then optimize these factors directly via simple iterative\nmethods such as gradient descent and alternating minimization. Despite\nnonconvexity, recent literatures have shown that these simple heuristics in\nfact achieve linear convergence when initialized properly for a growing number\nof problems of interest. However, upon closer examination, existing approaches\ncan still be computationally expensive especially for ill-conditioned matrices:\nthe convergence rate of gradient descent depends linearly on the condition\nnumber of the low-rank matrix, while the per-iteration cost of alternating\nminimization is often prohibitive for large matrices. The goal of this paper is\nto set forth a competitive algorithmic approach dubbed Scaled Gradient Descent\n(ScaledGD) which can be viewed as pre-conditioned or diagonally-scaled gradient\ndescent, where the pre-conditioners are adaptive and iteration-varying with a\nminimal computational overhead. With tailored variants for low-rank matrix\nsensing, robust principal component analysis and matrix completion, we\ntheoretically show that ScaledGD achieves the best of both worlds: it converges\nlinearly at a rate independent of the condition number of the low-rank matrix\nsimilar as alternating minimization, while maintaining the low per-iteration\ncost of gradient descent. Our analysis is also applicable to general loss\nfunctions that are restricted strongly convex and smooth over low-rank\nmatrices. To the best of our knowledge, ScaledGD is the first algorithm that\nprovably has such properties over a wide range of low-rank matrix estimation\ntasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 May 2020 17:17:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2020 03:13:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 28 Sep 2020 18:20:43 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 14 Jun 2021 20:11:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-16"}

This yields sharp control on the\narea of the pseudospectrum $\\Lambda_\\epsilon(A+\\gamma G_n)$ in terms of the\npseudospectral parameter $\\epsilon>0$, which is sufficient to bound the\noverlaps and eigenvector condition number via a limiting argument.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 May 2020 17:56:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-19"}

Then we optimize the pruning vector with\ngradient update and model joint pruning as a numerical gradient optimization\nprocess. To overcome the challenge that there is no explicit function between\nthe loss and the pruning vectors, we proposed self-adapted stochastic gradient\nestimation to construct a gradient path through network loss to pruning vectors\nand enable efficient gradient update.

In particular, we show that about 1-100\nTeV neutrinos and MeV gamma-rays can efficiently be produced in hot coronae\naround an accretion disk.

Second, we\nconsider possible cosmic-ray acceleration by sub-relativistic disk-driven winds\nor interactions between tidal streams, and show that subsequent hadronuclear\nand photohadronic interactions inside the TDE debris lead to GeV-PeV neutrinos\nand sub-GeV cascade gamma-rays.

We\ninfer the completeness of Gaia DR2 by exploiting the fact that it only contains\nsources with at least five astrometric detections. The odds that a source\nachieves those five detections depends on both the number of observations and\nthe probability that an observation of that source results in a detection. We\npredict the number of times that each source was observed by Gaia and assume\nthat the probability of detection is either a function of magnitude or a\ndistribution as a function of magnitude. We fit both these models to the 1.7\nbillion stars of Gaia DR2, and thus are able to robustly predict the\ncompleteness of Gaia across the sky as a function of magnitude.

As we\nexplain, such large COM magnitudes arise from an unconventional cooperative\nspin canting of edge spins when Rashba and Ising spin orbit coupling act\ntogether. Strikingly, COM can compete with spin moments to produce an unusual\nanisotropic edge magnetoresistance oriented at an oblique angle.

Hence, one often resorts to transfer learning to transfer\nknowledge learned from a source domain with sufficient labelled data to a\ntarget domain with limited labelled data. However, most existing transfer\nlearning techniques only focus on one-way transfer which brings no benefit to\nthe source domain. In addition, there is the risk of a covert adversary\ncorrupting a number of domains, which can consequently result in inaccurate\nprediction or privacy leakage. In this paper we construct a secure and\nVerifiable collaborative Transfer Learning scheme, VerifyTL, to support two-way\ntransfer learning over potentially untrusted datasets by improving knowledge\ntransfer from a target domain to a source domain. Further, we equip VerifyTL\nwith a cross transfer unit and a weave transfer unit employing SPDZ computation\nto provide privacy guarantee and verification in the two-domain setting and the\nmulti-domain setting, respectively. Thus, VerifyTL is secure against covert\nadversary that can compromise up to n-1 out of n data domains.

Here we investigate the\ninfluence of differential accretion on MBHB merger rates, chirp masses and the\nresulting GWB spectrum. We evolve a MBHB sample from the Illustris hydrodynamic\ncosmological simulation using semi-analytic models and for the first time\nself-consistently evolve their masses with binary accretion models. In all\nmodels, MBHBs coalesce with median total masses up to $1.5 \\times 10^8\nM_{\\odot}$, up to $3-4$ times larger than in models neglecting accretion. In\nour model with the largest plausible impact, the median mass ratio of\ncoalescing MBHBs increases by a factor $3.6$, the coalescence rate by $52.3\\%$,\nand the GWB amplitude by a factor $4.0$, yielding a dimensionless GWB strain\n$A_{yr^{-1}} = 1 \\times 10^{-15}$. Our model that favours accretion onto the\nprimary MBH reduces the median mass ratio of coalescing MBHBs by a factor of\n$2.9$, and yields a GWB amplitude $A_{yr^{-1}} = 3.1 \\times 10^{-16}$. This is\nnearly indistinguishable from our model neglecting accretion, despite higher\nMBHB masses at coalescence. \\textbf{We further predict binary separation and\nmass ratio distributions of stalled MBHBs in the low-redshift universe, and\nfind that these depend sensitively on binary accretion models. This presents\nthe potential for combined EM and GW observational constraints on merger rates\nand accretion models of MBHB populations.}\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 May 2020 18:17:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Jun 2020 18:59:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-19"}

If too few bins are chosen, the rank histogram is\nlikely to miss miscalibrations; if too many are chosen, even perfectly\ncalibrated forecast systems can yield rank histograms that do not appear\nuniform.

Each publication makes an\nempirical or theoretical case for the algorithm proposed in that publication\nand results across studies are often inconsistent in their claims about which\nalgorithm is 'best'. This is partly because there is no agreed evaluation\napproach to determine their effectiveness. Moreover, each algorithm is based on\na set of assumptions, such as complete data and causal sufficiency, and tend to\nbe evaluated with data that conforms to these assumptions, however unrealistic\nthese assumptions may be in the real world.

At\ntest time, the sampling of the VAE latent space allows to generate an arbitrary\nlarge number of cardiac shapes, which are fed to the GAN that subsequently\ngenerates MR images whose cardiac structure fits that of the cardiac shapes. In\nother words, our system can generate a large volume of realistic yet labeled\ncardiac MR images. We show that segmentation with CNNs trained with our\nsynthetic annotated images gets competitive results compared to traditional\ntechniques. We also show that combining data augmentation with our\nGAN-generated images lead to an improvement in the Dice score of up to 12\npercent while allowing for better generalization capabilities on other\ndatasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 May 2020 18:48:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 May 2020 09:28:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-25"}

The common method for\nmitigating the risk of online cracking is to lock out the user after a fixed\nnumber ($K$) of consecutive incorrect login attempts. Selecting the value of\n$K$ induces a classic security-usability trade-off. When $K$ is too large a\nhacker can (quickly) break into a significant fraction of user accounts, but\nwhen $K$ is too low we will start to annoy honest users by locking them out\nafter a few mistakes. Motivated by the observation that honest user mistakes\ntypically look quite different than the password guesses of an online attacker,\nwe introduce DALock a {\\em distribution aware} password lockout mechanism to\nreduce user annoyance while minimizing user risk. As the name suggests, DALock\nis designed to be aware of the frequency and popularity of the password used\nfor login attacks while standard throttling mechanisms (e.g., $K$-strikes) are\noblivious to the password distribution. In particular, DALock maintains an\nextra \"hit count\" in addition to \"strike count\" for each user which is based on\n(estimates of) the cumulative probability of {\\em all} login attempts for that\nparticular account. We empirically evaluate DALock with an extensive battery of\nsimulations using real world password datasets.

Although the artificial pancreas and continuous glucose\nmonitoring have been proven to be effective in achieving closed-loop control,\nsignificant challenges still remain due to the high complexity of glucose\ndynamics and limitations in the technology. In this work, we propose a novel\ndeep reinforcement learning model for single-hormone (insulin) and dual-hormone\n(insulin and glucagon) delivery. In particular, the delivery strategies are\ndeveloped by double Q-learning with dilated recurrent neural networks. For\ndesigning and testing purposes, the FDA-accepted UVA/Padova Type 1 simulator\nwas employed. First, we performed long-term generalized training to obtain a\npopulation model. Then, this model was personalized with a small data-set of\nsubject-specific data. In silico results show that the single and dual-hormone\ndelivery strategies achieve good glucose control when compared to a standard\nbasal-bolus therapy with low-glucose insulin suspension. Specifically, in the\nadult cohort (n=10), percentage time in target range [70, 180] mg/dL improved\nfrom 77.6% to 80.9% with single-hormone control, and to $85.6\\%$ with\ndual-hormone control. In the adolescent cohort (n=10), percentage time in\ntarget range improved from 55.5% to 65.9% with single-hormone control, and to\n78.8% with dual-hormone control. In all scenarios, a significant decrease in\nhypoglycemia was observed. These results show that the use of deep\nreinforcement learning is a viable approach for closed-loop glucose control in\nT1D.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 May 2020 20:13:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-08"}

Planet formation is expected to take place in the first million\nyears of a planetary system through various processes, which remain to be\ntested through observations. Aims. With the recent discovery, using ALMA, of\ntwo gaseous spiral arms inside the 120 au cavity and connected to dusty\nspirals, the famous protoplanetary disk around AB Aurigae presents a strong\nincentive for investigating the mechanisms that lead to giant planet formation.\nA candidate protoplanet located inside a spiral arm has already been claimed in\nan earlier study based on the same ALMA data. Methods. We used SPHERE at the\nVery Large Telescope (VLT) to perform near-infrared (IR) high-contrast imaging\nof AB Aur in polarized and unpolarized light in order to study the morphology\nof the disk and search for signs of planet formation. Results. SPHERE has\ndelivered the deepest images ever obtained for AB Aur in scattered light. Among\nthe many structures that are yet to be understood, we identified not only the\ninner spiral arms, but we also resolved a feature in the form of a twist in the\neastern spiral at a separation of about 30 au. The twist of the spiral is\nperfectly reproduced with a planet-driven density wave model when projection\neffects are accounted for. We measured an azimuthal displacement with respect\nto the counterpart of this feature in the ALMA data, which is consistent with\nKeplerian motion on a 4-yr baseline. Another point sxce is detected near the\nedge of the inner ring, which is likely the result of scattering as opposed to\nthe direct emission from a planet photosphere. We tentatively derived mass\nconstraints for these two features. Conclusions. The twist and its apparent\norbital motion could well be the first direct evidence of a connection between\na protoplanet candidate and its manifestation as a spiral imprinted in the gas\nand dust distributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 May 2020 20:28:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-20"}

Function splitting and Radio over Ethernet are\ntwo promising approaches to reduce these drawbacks of the C-RAN architecture.\nMeanwhile, the usage of renewable energy sources (RESs) in a C-RAN boosts the\nenergy-efficiency potential of this network. In this paper, we propose a novel\nmodel, which is called Green Radio OVer Ethernet (GROVE), that merges these\nthree approaches to maximize the benefits of C-RAN while maintaining the\neconomic feasibility of this architecture. We briefly explain this model and\nformulate an operational expenditure minimization problem by considering the\nseveral restrictions due to the network design and the service provisioning.\nThen we linearize the quadratic routing decision constraints in the problem to\nsolve it with a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) solver. Results show\nthat it is cost-effective to choose routing, function splitting, and RES\ndecisions together. Our solution surpasses classical disjoint approaches for\nall studied cases. Besides, we provide a network scalability analysis to\ndetermine the MILP solver's limits for larger network topologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 May 2020 20:55:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 5 Dec 2020 16:18:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-13"}

Habitability depends on temperature, which is set by insolation\nand the greenhouse effect, due mainly to CO2 and water vapor. The CO2 level is\nincreased by volcanic outgassing, and decreased by continental and seafloor\nweathering. Here, I examine the climate evolution of Earth-like planets using a\nglobally averaged climate model that includes both weathering types. Climate is\nsensitive to the relative contributions of continental and seafloor weathering,\neven when the total weathering rate is fixed. Climate also depends strongly on\nthe dependence of seafloor weathering on CO2 partial pressure. Both these\nfactors are uncertain. Earth-like planets have two equilibrium climate states:\n(i) an ice-free state where outgassing is balanced by both weathering types,\nand (ii) an ice-covered state where outgassing is balanced by seafloor\nweathering alone. The second of these has not been explored in detail before.\nFor some planets, neither state exists, and the climate cycles between\nice-covered and ice-free states. For some other planets, both equilibria exist,\nand the climate depends on the initial conditions. Insolation increases over\ntime due to stellar evolution, so a planet usually encounters the ice-covered\nequilibrium first. Such a planet will remain ice-covered, even if the ice-free\nstate appears subsequently, unless the climate receives a large perturbation.\nThe ice-covered equilibrium state covers a large fraction of phase space for\nEarth-like planets. Many planets conventionally assigned to a star's habitable\nzone may be rendered uninhabitable as a result.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 May 2020 21:14:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-24"}

Synaptic signaling, as a natural implementation of this\nparadigm, encompasses functional components that, once understood, can\nfacilitate the development of synthetic DMC systems. To unleash this potential,\nhowever, a thorough understanding of the synaptic communication channel based\non biophysical principles is needed. Since synaptic transmission critically\ndepends also on non-neural cells, such understanding requires the consideration\nof the so-called tripartite synapse. In this paper, we develop a comprehensive\nchannel model of the tripartite synapse encompassing a three-dimensional,\nfinite-size spatial model of the synaptic cleft, molecule uptake at the\npresynaptic neuron and at glial cells, reversible binding to individual\nreceptors at the postsynaptic neuron, and spillover to the extrasynaptic space.\nBased on this model, we derive analytical time domain expressions for the\nchannel impulse response (CIR) of the synaptic DMC system and for the number of\nmolecules taken up at the presynaptic neuron and at glial cells, respectively.\nThese expressions provide insight into the impact of macroscopic physical\nchannel parameters on the decay rate of the CIR and the reuptake rate, and\nreveal fundamental limits for synaptic signal transmission induced by chemical\nreaction kinetics and the channel geometry. Adapted to realistic parameters,\nour model produces plausible results when compared to experimental and\nsimulation studies and we provide results from particle-based computer\nsimulations to further validate the analytical model. The proposed\ncomprehensive channel model admits a wide range of synaptic configurations\nmaking it suitable for the investigation of many practically relevant\nquestions, such as the impact of glial cell uptake and spillover on signal\ntransmission in the tripartite synapse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 May 2020 21:52:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Nov 2020 12:26:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-26"}

Although Dijkstra's algorithm and the\nLARS formulation provide exact solutions, they become impractical when the size\nof the graph is exceedingly large. To overcome this issue, the alternating\ndirection method of multipliers (ADMM) is proposed to solve the lasso\nformulation. The resulting algorithm produces good and fast approximations of\nthe shortest path by sacrificing exactness that may not be absolutely essential\nin many applications. Numerical experiments are provided to illustrate the\nperformance of the proposed approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 May 2020 01:16:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 May 2020 18:04:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-26"}

For a given pair of time series\nof length $n$ such that the dissimilarity between any elements is an integer\nbetween zero and $c$, we propose an integer sequence that represents any\nsubstring-substring DTW distance as its band-substring LIS length. The length\nof the produced integer sequence is $O(c n^2)$, which can be translated to\n$O(n^2)$ for constant dissimilarity functions. To demonstrate that techniques\ndeveloped under the LCS(-like) measures are directly applicable to analysis of\ntime series via our reduction of DTW to LIS, we present time-efficient\nalgorithms for DTW-related problems utilizing the semi-local sequence\ncomparison technique developed for LCS-related problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 May 2020 02:21:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Mar 2021 11:39:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 18 Apr 2022 07:36:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-19"}

In this paper, we study the effect of intrinsic dataset\nproperties on the performance of adversarial attack and defense methods,\ntesting on five popular image classification datasets - MNIST, Fashion-MNIST,\nCIFAR10/CIFAR100, and ImageNet.

This, of course, also applies to the Earth system. With\nits myriad of processes, spanning from purely physical to life and human\nactivity, the Earth is a vastly complex system. It may thus seem that there is\nnothing simple and general to say because of this overwhelming complexity. What\nI want to show here is that by formulating the Earth as a thermodynamic system,\none can identify general directions and infer simple functioning because\nthermodynamics imposes fundamental limits on the dynamics. At the center of\nthis description are energy conversions and states of disequilibrium, which are\nat the core of the dynamics of Earth system processes, from convection cells to\nliving organisms and human societies. They are linked to each other and\ninteract by their exchanges of energy and mass, and ultimately affect how much\nof the input of low entropy solar radiation from the Sun is converted into free\nenergy, energy able to perform work, before the energy gets re-emitted by the\nEarth as high entropy terrestrial radiation. The emergent thermodynamic\nbehavior of the Earth then becomes simple because the dynamics evolve to and\noperate at thermodynamic limits. Such behavior of Earth system processes\noperating at the edge of their limit can then be linked to previously described\nholistic theories, such as the Gaia hypothesis, with similarities in the\ndescribed emergent behavior. Such a thermodynamic view, however, can go\nfurther, as it can also be used to understand the role of human societies in\nthe Earth system and the potential pathways to a sustainable future.\nThermodynamics taken together with the energy conversions and interactions\nwithin the Earth system can thus provide a basis to understand why the whole\nEarth system is more, and simpler, than the sum of its spheres.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 May 2020 05:24:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-20"}

They often rely on\n``inverting'' the distribution of labels, e.g. answering mostly 'yes' when the\ncommon training answer is 'no'. Second, the OOD test set is used for model\nselection. Third, a model's in-domain performance is assessed after retraining\nit on in-domain splits (VQA v2) that exhibit a more balanced distribution of\nlabels. These three practices defeat the objective of evaluating\ngeneralization, and put into question the value of methods specifically\ndesigned for this dataset. We show that embarrassingly-simple methods,\nincluding one that generates answers at random, surpass the state of the art on\nsome question types. We provide short- and long-term solutions to avoid these\npitfalls and realize the benefits of OOD evaluation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 May 2020 06:45:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-20"}

Regarding the perceptual bias, since\nDNNs are strongly biased towards textures, we exploit the hard examples which\nconvey strong model uncertainties and extract a textural patch prior from them\nby adopting the style similarities. The patch prior is more close to decision\nboundaries and would promote attacks.

For an undirected and\nunweighted graph, (Malik, Mittal, and Gupta, Operation Research Letters, 1989)\nand (Hershberger and Suri, FOCS 2001) designed an algorithm that solves the\nreplacement path problem in $\\tilde O(m+n)$ time. It is natural to ask whether\nwe can generalize the replacement path problem: {\\em can we find all\nreplacement paths from a source $s$ to all vertices in $G$?} This problem is\ncalled the Single Source Replacement Path Problem.\n  Recently (Chechik and Cohen, SODA 2019) designed a randomized combinatorial\nalgorithm that solves the Single Source Replacement Path Problem in $\\tilde\nO(m\\sqrt n\\ + n^2)$ time. One of the questions left unanswered by their work is\nthe case when there are many sources, not one. When there are $n$ sources, the\ncombinatorial algorithm of (Bernstein and Karger, STOC 2009) can be used to\nfind all pair replacement path in $\\tilde O(mn + n^3)$ time.

We give a randomized\ncombinatorial algorithm for this problem that takes $\\tilde O(m\\sqrt{n \\sigma}\n+\\ \\sigma n^2)$ time. This result generalizes both results known for this\nproblem.

Secondly, more\ntungsten oxides are detected in porous materials and nanoparticles than in\ncompact films, and the intensities of the Raman band correlate to their oxygen\ncontent. Thirdly, thermal stability of these films (i.e. structural and\nchemical modification under laser heating) is poor when compact films contain a\nsufficiently large amount of nitrogen. This finding suggests that nitrogen can\nbe substituted by oxygen during Raman laser induced heating occurring in\nambient air.

If we erase the heralded information after the interference has been\nmeasured, the interference pattern is recovered, thereby implementing a\ndelayed-choice quantum erasure. The test is implemented using a closed\nsurface-acoustic-wave communication channel into which one superconducting\nqubit can emit itinerant phonons that the same or a second qubit can later\nre-capture. If the first qubit releases only half of a phonon, the system\nfollows a superposition of paths during the phonon propagation: either an\nitinerant phonon is in the channel, or the first qubit remains in its excited\nstate. These two paths are made to constructively or destructively interfere by\nchanging the relative phase of the two intermediate states, resulting in a\nphase-dependent modulation of the first qubit's final state, following\ninteraction with the half-phonon. A heralding mechanism is added to this\nconstruct, entangling a heralding phonon with the signalling phonon. The first\nqubit emits a phonon herald conditioned on the qubit being in its excited\nstate, with no signaling phonon, and the second qubit catches this heralding\nphonon, storing which-path information which can either be read out, destroying\nthe signaling phonon's self-interference, or erased.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 May 2020 09:25:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-14"}

The\nLagrangian of the CFT is a functional of a single scalar field, the condensate\nof a thermal scalar, which is proportional to the entropy density of the\nstrings. The correspondence has some aspects in common with the anti-de\nSitter/CFT correspondence, as well as with some of its proposed analytic\ncontinuations to a dS/CFT correspondence, but it also has some important\nconceptual and technical differences. The equilibrium state of the CFT is one\nof maximal pressure and entropy, and it is at a temperature that is above but\nparametrically close to the Hagedorn temperature.

The drag experienced by a square obstacle placed in a\nturbulent channel flow (in two dimensions) is taken as a representative case\nstudy. Direct sampling shows that extreme fluctuations are closely related to\nthe presence of a strong vortex blocked in the near wake of the obstacle. This\nvortex is responsible for a significant pressure drop between the forebody and\nthe base of the obstacle, thus yielding a very high value of the drag. Two\nalgorithms are then considered to speed up the sampling of such flow scenarii,\nnamely the AMS and the GKTL algorithms. The general idea behind these\nalgorithms is to replace a long simulation by a set of much shorter ones,\nrunning in parallel, with dynamics that are replicated or pruned, according to\nsome specific rules designed to sample large-amplitude events more frequently.\nThese algorithms have been shown to be relevant for a wide range of problems in\nstatistical physics, computer science, biochemistry. The present study is the\nfirst application to a fluid-structure interaction problem. Practical evidence\nis given that the fast sweeping time of turbulent fluid structures past the\nobstacle has a strong influence on the efficiency of the rare-event algorithm.\nWhile the AMS algorithm does not yield significant run-time savings as compared\nto direct sampling, the GKTL algorithm appears to be effective to sample very\nefficiently extreme fluctuations of the time-averaged drag and estimate related\nstatistics such as return times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 May 2020 09:42:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-20"}

Consequently, identifying substitutable items that are\ninterchangeable opens up new opportunities to refine the quality of generated\ncandidates. When a user is browsing a specific type of product (e.g., a laptop)\nto buy, the accurate recommendation of substitutes (e.g., better equipped\nlaptops) can offer the user more suitable options to choose from, thus\nsubstantially increasing the chance of a successful purchase. However, existing\nmethods merely treat this problem as mining pairwise item relationships without\nthe consideration of users' personal preferences.

These items are then\nfed into an aggregation module to obtain the overall recommendation. The\naggregation module leverages a controllable factor to balance the\nrecommendation accuracy and diversity. We conduct experiments for the\nsequential recommendation on two real-world datasets, Amazon and Taobao.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves significant\nimprovements over state-of-the-art models. Our framework has also been\nsuccessfully deployed on the offline Alibaba distributed cloud platform.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 May 2020 10:18:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Aug 2020 02:16:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-04"}

However, acquiring and interpreting cardiac US images is operator\ndependent, limiting its use to only places where experts are present. Recently,\nDeep Learning (DL) has been used in 2D echocardiography for automated view\nclassification, and structure and function assessment. Although these recent\nworks show promise in developing computer-guided acquisition and automated\ninterpretation of echocardiograms, most of these methods do not model and\nestimate uncertainty which can be important when testing on data coming from a\ndistribution further away from that of the training data. Uncertainty estimates\ncan be beneficial both during the image acquisition phase (by providing\nreal-time feedback to the operator on acquired image's quality), and during\nautomated measurement and interpretation. The performance of uncertainty models\nand quantification metric may depend on the prediction task and the models\nbeing compared.

In this work we use velocity dispersion as an age proxy to\nreveal the temperature-dependent rotational evolution of low-mass Kepler\ndwarfs, and demonstrate that kinematic ages could be a useful tool for\ncalibrating gyrochronology in the future. We find that a linear gyrochronology\nmodel, calibrated to fit the period-Teff relationship of the Praesepe cluster,\ndoes not apply to stars older than around 1 Gyr. Although late-K dwarfs spin\nmore slowly than early-K dwarfs when they are young, at old ages we find that\nlate-K dwarfs rotate at the same rate or faster than early-K dwarfs of the same\nage. This result agrees qualitatively with semi-empirical models that vary the\nrate of surface-to-core angular momentum transport as a function of time and\nmass. It also aligns with recent observations of stars in the NGC 6811 cluster,\nwhich indicate that the surface rotation rates of K dwarfs go through an epoch\nof inhibited evolution. We find that the oldest Kepler stars with measured\nrotation periods are late-K and early-M dwarfs, indicating that these stars\nmaintain spotted surfaces and stay magnetically active longer than more massive\nstars. Finally, based on their kinematics, we confirm that many rapidly\nrotating GKM dwarfs are likely to be synchronized binaries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 May 2020 12:27:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-12"}

In this\nobserving mode, rotational glitches are discovered, when the residuals of the\nno-glitch phase model diverge after some epoch, and glitch parameters are\nrefined by Bayesian follow-up.

To address this issue, a volume-averaged multi-phase flow model for\nimmersed bidisperse granular flows was developed based on an interparticle\nsegregation force (Guillard et al. 2016) and a granular Stokesian drag force\n(Tripathi and Khakhar 2013). An advection-diffusion model was derived from this\nmodel yielding parametrisations for the advection and diffusion coefficients\nbased on the interparticle interactions. This approach makes it possible to\nbridge the gap between grain-scale physics and continuum modelling. Both models\nwere successfully tested against existing Discrete Element Model (DEM)\nsimulations of size segregation in bedload transport (Chassagne et al. 2020).\nThrough a detailed investigation of the granular forces, it is demonstrated\nthat the observed scaling of the advection and diffusion coefficients with the\ninertial number can be explained by the granular drag force dependency on the\nviscosity. The drag coefficient was shown to be linearly dependent on the small\nparticle concentration. The scaling relationship of the segregation force with\nthe friction coefficient is confirmed and additional non-trivial dependencies\nincluding the inertial number and small particle concentration are identified.\nLastly, adding a size ratio dependency in the segregation force perfectly\nreproduces the DEM results for a large range of small particle concentrations\nand size-ratios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 May 2020 13:25:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-28"}

Yet, citizens should keep trusting the emergency communicators even\nafter they made forecasting errors in the past.\n  We have designed a serious game called Vigiflood, based on a real case study\nof flash floods hitting the South West of France in October 2018. In this game,\nthe user changes perspective by taking the role of an emergency communicator,\nhaving to set the level of vigilance to alert the population, based on\nuncertain clues. Our hypothesis is that this change of perspective can improve\nthe player's awareness and response to future flood vigilance announcements. We\nevaluated this game through an online survey where people were asked to answer\na questionnaire about flood risk awareness and behavioural intentions before\nand after playing the game, in order to assess its impact.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 May 2020 14:05:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-20"}

The order we define depends\nonly on the choice of a monic irreducible integral defining polynomial for each\nfield $K$, and we start by defining for each field its unique reduced defining\npolynomial, after Belabas. We define a total order on the set of prime ideals\nof $K$ and then extend this to a total order on the set of all nonzero integral\nideals of $K$. This order allows us to give a unique label of the form $N.i$,\nwhere $N$ is its norm and $i$ is the index of the ideal in the ordered list of\nall ideals of norm $N$. Our ideal labelling scheme has several nice properties:\nfor a given norm, prime ideals always appear first, and given the factorisation\nof the norm, the bijection between ideals of norm $N$ and labels is computable\nin polynomial time.\n  Our motivation for this is to have a well-defined and concise way to sort and\nlabel ideals for use in databases such as the LMFDB.

In this\nframework, the components of the supergravity multiplet are contained in the\nsupervielbein and torsion tensor of superspace. Furthermore, interactions with\nthe Yang-Mills (vector) multiplet are formulated by introducing a connection\n$1$-superform of an additional gauge structure.

The memory wall problem is further\nexacerbated when massive parallelism and frequent data movement are required\nbetween processing and memory units for real-time implementation of artificial\nneural network (ANN) that enables many intelligent applications. One of the\nmost promising approach to address the memory wall problem is to carry out\ncomputations inside the memory core itself that enhances the memory bandwidth\nand energy efficiency for extensive computations. This paper presents an\nin-memory computing architecture for ANN enabling artificial intelligence (AI)\nand machine learning (ML) applications. The proposed architecture utilizes deep\nin-memory architecture based on standard six transistor (6T) static random\naccess memory (SRAM) core for the implementation of a multi-layered perceptron.\nOur novel on-chip training and inference in-memory architecture reduces energy\ncost and enhances throughput by simultaneously accessing the multiple rows of\nSRAM array per precharge cycle and eliminating the frequent access of data. The\nproposed architecture realizes backpropagation which is the keystone during the\nnetwork training using newly proposed different building blocks such as weight\nupdation, analog multiplication, error calculation, signed analog to digital\nconversion, and other necessary signal control units.

At zero filling factor, i.e. at the\ncharge neutrality point, the optical conductivity is quite sensitive to the\nvalue of $u_0$ and twist angle, whereas the charge inhomogeneity brings about\nonly modest corrections. On the other hand, away from zero filling, static\nscreening dominates and the optical conductivity is appreciably affected by the\ncharge inhomogeneity, the largest effects being seen on the intra-band\ncontribution to it.

The resulting generalized theory is capable of capturing both\nstiffening and softening effects and it is not subject to the inconsistencies\noften observed under selected external loads and boundary conditions. The\ngoverning equations of a 1D continuum are derived by continualization of the\nLagrangian of a 1D lattice subject to long-range interactions. This approach is\nparticularly well suited to highlight the connection between the\nfractional-order operators and the microscopic properties of the medium. The\napproach is also extended to derive, by means of variational principles, the\ngoverning equations of a 3D continuum in strong form. The positive definite\npotential energy, characteristic of our fractional formulation, always ensures\nwell-posed governing equations. This aspect, combined with the differ-integral\nnature of fractional-order operators, guarantees both stability and the ability\nto capture dispersion without requiring additional inertia gradient terms. The\nproposed formulation is applied to the static and free vibration analyses of\neither Timoshenko beams or Mindlin plates. Numerical results, obtained by a\nfractional-order finite element method, show that the fractional-order\nformulation is able to model both stiffening and softening response in these\nslender structures. The numerical results provide the foundation to critically\nanalyze the physical significance of the different fractional model parameters\nas well as their effect on the response of the structural elements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 May 2020 03:59:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-21"}

In\nthe early phase, many countries employed manual contact tracing to contain the\nrate of disease spread, however it has many issues. The manual approach is\ncumbersome, time consuming and also requires active participation of a large\nnumber of people to realize it. In order to overcome these drawbacks, digital\ncontact tracing has been proposed that typically involves deploying a contact\ntracing application on people's mobile devices which can track their movements\nand close social interactions. While studies suggest that digital contact\ntracing is more effective than manual contact tracing, it has been observed\nthat higher adoption rates of the contact tracing app may result in a better\ncontrolled epidemic. This also increases the confidence in the accuracy of the\ncollected data and the subsequent analytics. One key reason for low adoption\nrate of contact tracing applications is the concern about individual privacy.\nIn fact, several studies report that contact tracing applications deployed in\nmultiple countries are not privacy friendly and have potential to be used for\nmass surveillance by the concerned governments. Hence, privacy respecting\ncontact tracing application is the need of the hour that can lead to highly\neffective, efficient contact tracing.

Knowledge of this ground truth is\nimportant for accurately evaluating the accuracy with which contact events are\ndetected by Bluetooth LE. We approach this by adopting a scenario-based\napproach. In summary, we find that the Bluetooth LE received signal strength\ncan vary substantially depending on the relative orientation of handsets, on\nabsorption by the human body, reflection/absorption of radio signals in\nbuildings and trains. Indeed we observe that the received signal strength need\nnot decrease with increasing distance. This suggests that the development of\naccurate methods for proximity detection based on Bluetooth LE received signal\nstrength is likely to be challenging. Our measurements also suggest that\ncombining use of Bluetooth LE contact tracing apps with adoption of new social\nprotocols may yield benefits but this requires further investigation. For\nexample, placing phones on the table during meetings is likely to simplify\nproximity detection using received signal strength. Similarly, carrying\nhandbags with phones placed close to the outside surface. In locations where\nthe complexity of signal propagation makes proximity detection using received\nsignal strength problematic entry/exit from the location might instead be\nlogged in an app by e.g. scanning a time-varying QR code or the like.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 May 2020 13:51:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-15"}
