In many of these cases, users regret posting such\ncontent. To retrospectively rectify these errors in users' sharing decisions,\nmost platforms offer (deletion) mechanisms to withdraw the content, and social\nmedia users often utilize them. Ironically and perhaps unfortunately, these\ndeletions make users more susceptible to privacy violations by malicious actors\nwho specifically hunt post deletions at large scale. The reason for such\nhunting is simple: deleting a post acts as a powerful signal that the post\nmight be damaging to its owner. Today, multiple archival services are already\nscanning social media for these deleted posts. Moreover, as we demonstrate in\nthis work, powerful machine learning models can detect damaging deletions at\nscale.\n  Towards restraining such a global adversary against users' right to be\nforgotten, we introduce Deceptive Deletion, a decoy mechanism that minimizes\nthe adversarial advantage. Our mechanism injects decoy deletions, hence\ncreating a two-player minmax game between an adversary that seeks to classify\ndamaging content among the deleted posts and a challenger that employs decoy\ndeletions to masquerade real damaging deletions. We formalize the Deceptive\nGame between the two players, determine conditions under which either the\nadversary or the challenger provably wins the game, and discuss the scenarios\nin-between these two extremes. We apply the Deceptive Deletion mechanism to a\nreal-world task on Twitter: hiding damaging tweet deletions. We show that a\npowerful global adversary can be beaten by a powerful challenger, raising the\nbar significantly and giving a glimmer of hope in the ability to be really\nforgotten on social platforms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 May 2020 16:08:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-29"}

Recent years have witnessed a flurry\nof interest in these functions. Ridge functions appear in various fields and\nunder various guises. They appear in fields as diverse as partial differential\nequations (where they are called plane waves), computerized tomography and\nstatistics. These functions are also the underpinnings of many central models\nin neural networks.\n  We are interested in ridge functions from the point of view of approximation\ntheory. The basic goal in approximation theory is to approximate complicated\nobjects by simpler objects. Among many classes of multivariate functions,\nlinear combinations of ridge functions are a class of simpler functions. These\nnotes study some problems of approximation of multivariate functions by linear\ncombinations of ridge functions. We present here various properties of these\nfunctions. The questions we ask are as follows. When can a multivariate\nfunction be expressed as a linear combination of ridge functions from a certain\nclass? When do such linear combinations represent each multivariate function?\nIf a precise representation is not possible, can one approximate arbitrarily\nwell? If well approximation fails, how can one compute/estimate the error of\napproximation, know that a best approximation exists? How can one characterize\nand construct best approximations? If a smooth function is a sum of arbitrarily\nbehaved ridge functions, can it be expressed as a sum of smooth ridge\nfunctions? We also study properties of generalized ridge functions, which are\nvery much related to linear superpositions and Kolmogorov's famous\nsuperposition theorem. These notes end with a few applications of ridge\nfunctions to the problem of approximation by single and two hidden layer neural\nnetworks with a restricted set of weights.\n  We hope that these notes will be useful and interesting to both researchers\nand students.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 May 2020 16:20:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 27 Jul 2020 15:20:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 29 Aug 2020 03:49:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-01"}

Popular AD algorithms commonly try to learn a model of normality\nfrom scratch using task specific datasets, but are limited to semi-supervised\napproaches employing mostly normal data due to the inaccessibility of anomalies\non a large scale combined with the ambiguous nature of anomaly appearance.\n  We follow an alternative approach and demonstrate that deep feature\nrepresentations learned by discriminative models on large natural image\ndatasets are well suited to describe normality and detect even subtle anomalies\nin a transfer learning setting. Our model of normality is established by\nfitting a multivariate Gaussian (MVG) to deep feature representations of\nclassification networks trained on ImageNet using normal data only. By\nsubsequently applying the Mahalanobis distance as the anomaly score we\noutperform the current state of the art on the public MVTec AD dataset,\nachieving an AUROC value of $95.8 \\pm 1.2$ (mean $\\pm$ SEM) over all 15\nclasses. We further investigate why the learned representations are\ndiscriminative to the AD task using Principal Component Analysis. We find that\nthe principal components containing little variance in normal data are the ones\ncrucial for discriminating between normal and anomalous instances. This gives a\npossible explanation to the often sub-par performance of AD approaches trained\nfrom scratch using normal data only. By selectively fitting a MVG to these most\nrelevant components only, we are able to further reduce model complexity while\nretaining AD performance.

However, for certain discussed reasons, including the features\nof the problem, tree search organization, and also the approach of MCTS in the\nSimulation step, MCTS takes more time to execute in Large size scenarios.\nConsequently, we have found the bottleneck for the MCTS-based method in\nsignificant test cases that could be improved in two real-world problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 May 2020 17:19:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-29"}

In practice, it is necessary to capture user's\ndrifting interests by modeling sequential user behaviors to build an accurate\nCTR prediction model. However, as the users accumulate more and more behavioral\ndata on the platforms, it becomes non-trivial for the sequential models to make\nuse of the whole behavior history of each user. First, directly feeding the\nlong behavior sequence will make online inference time and system load\ninfeasible. Second, there is much noise in such long histories to fail the\nsequential model learning.

MST's poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields ($B_\\text{p}$\nand $B_\\text{t}$) can be sourced by programmable power supplies (PPSs) based on\nintegrated-gate bipolar transistors (IGBT). In order to provide real-time\nsimultaneous control of both $B_\\text{p}$ and $B_\\text{t}$ circuits, a\ntime-independent integrated model is developed. The actuators considered for\nthe control are the $B_\\text{p}$ and $B_\\text{t}$ primary currents produced by\nthe PPSs. The control system goal will be tracking two particular demand\nquantities that can be measured at the plasma surface ($r=a$): the plasma\ncurrent, $I_\\text{p} \\sim B_\\text{p}(a)$, and the RFP reversal parameter,\n$F\\sim B_\\text{t}(a)/\\Phi$, where $\\Phi$ is the toroidal flux in the plasma.\nThe edge safety factor, $q(a)\\propto B_t(a)$, tends to track $F$ but not\nidentically. To understand the responses of $I_\\text{p}$ and $F$ to the\nactuators and to enable systematic design of control algorithms, dedicated\nexperiments are run in which the actuators are modulated, and a linearized\ndynamic data-driven model is generated using a system identification method. We\nperform a series of initial real-time experiments to test the designed feedback\ncontrollers and validate the derived model predictions. The feedback\ncontrollers show systematic improvements over simpler feedforward controllers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 May 2020 17:42:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 12 Aug 2020 06:47:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-13"}

In\nthis work, we investigate how the size of a substellar land mass affects the\noceans ability to transport heat and upwell nutrients on the tidally locked\nplanet Proxima Centauri b using the ROCKE-3D coupled ocean-atmosphere General\nCirculation Model (GCM).

Finally, we find that Proxima Centauri b transitions from a lobster\nstate where ocean heat transport distributes heat away from the substellar\npoint to an eyeball state where heat transport is restricted and surface\ntemperature decreases symmetrically from the substellar point when the\ncontinent size exceeds about 20 percent of the surface area.

The\nstandard scenario posits an initially circular and narrow belt of planetesimals\nat semi-major axis $a$, whose eccentricity is increased to $e_f$ after the gas\ndisc has dispersed by secular perturbations from an eccentric planet, resulting\nin a belt of width $2ae_f$. In a minor modification of this scenario, narrower\nbelts can arise if the planetesimals are initially eccentric, which could\nresult from earlier planet perturbations during the gas-rich protoplanetary\ndisc phase. However, a primordial eccentricity could alternatively be caused by\ninstabilities that increase the disc eccentricity, without the need for any\nplanets.

However,\nnegative longitudinal magnetoresistance is not unique to chiral anomaly and can\narise due to completely different mechanisms such as current jetting or in\nferromagnetic systems due to the suppression of scattering with magnons.\nTherefore, a macroscopic effect that can be uniquely attributed to the presence\nof Weyl nodes is desirable. Here we show that the planar Hall effect could be a\nhallmark for Weyl nodes. We investigated the anisotropic magnetoresistance and\nplanar Hall effect in Fe$_3$Sn$_2$, which has a kagome lattice and has been\npredicted to be a type II Weyl metal. We discover that the planar Hall effect\ncontains a field antisymmetric contribution in addition to the ordinary field\nsymmetric contribution. The field antisymmetric planar Hall effect has a 3-fold\nrotational symmetry, distinctively different from the symmetric planar Hall\neffect, but consistent with the 3-fold rotational degeneracy of the\nmagnetization in Fe$_3$Sn$_2$. The temperature and field dependence of the\nantisymmetric planar Hall effect rules out an interpretation based on\ncontribution from the anomalous Hall effect and is different from the symmetric\nplanar Hall effect, pointing to a different origin.

We study changes in\nvulnerabilities, code quality, project activity, and software engineering\npractices.\n  Method: We use a mixed methods approach, collecting multiple types of\nquantitative data and qualitative data from web sites and an interview with a\ndeveloper who worked on post-Heartbleed changes. We use regression\ndiscontinuity analysis to determine changes in levels and slopes of code and\nproject activity metrics resulting from Heartbleed.\n  Results: The OpenSSL project made tremendous improvements to code quality and\nsecurity after Heartbleed. By the end of 2016, the number of commits per month\nhad tripled, 91 vulnerabilities were found and fixed, code complexity decreased\nsignificantly, and OpenSSL obtained a CII best practices badge, certifying its\nuse of good open source development practices.\n  Conclusions: The OpenSSL project provides a model of how an open source\nproject can adapt and improve after a security event. The evolution of OpenSSL\nshows that the number of known vulnerabilities is not a useful indicator of\nproject security. A small number of vulnerabilities may simply indicate that a\nproject does not expend much effort to finding vulnerabilities. This study\nsuggests that project activity and CII badge best practices may be better\nindicators of code quality and security than vulnerability counts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 May 2020 19:03:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-01"}

The aim of this study is to initiate a carefully\nplanned nationwide EHR system in Vietnam by assessing the core readiness. The\nassessment structure is mainly based on previous research, which recommends a\nreadiness assessment prior to to an EHR system implementation. To collect data,\nparticipant observation, document analysis and an in-depth interview were used.\nThis study has revealed new insights into the current situation on EHR in\nVietnam. The Ministry of Health is currently working on improving the\nconditions for future implementation of a Vietnamese EHR system. There are\nissues with the current way of handling health records. These issues are\nencouraging the Ministry of Health to work on identifying the next steps for an\nEHR system implementation.

In conclusion, this study\nidentifies points which need to be further investigated prior to an\nimplementation. Generally, health care workers show good awareness of new\ntechnologies. As the Vietnam's health care system is centrally organised, there\nis the possibility for a nation-wide implementation. This could have a positive\nimpact on the health care system, however, besides rigours planning also\nstandards need to be followed and common interfaces implemented.

However, this rarely holds in practise.\nGeographic information data sets are an example where the data points have\nstronger dependencies among each other the closer they are geographically. This\nphenomenon known as spatial autocorrelation (SAC) causes the standard cross\nvalidation (CV) methods to produce optimistically biased prediction performance\nestimates for spatial models, which can result in increased costs and accidents\nin practical applications. To overcome this problem we propose a modified\nversion of the CV method called spatial k-fold cross validation (SKCV), which\nprovides a useful estimate for model prediction performance without optimistic\nbias due to SAC. We test SKCV with three real world cases involving open\nnatural data showing that the estimates produced by the ordinary CV are up to\n40% more optimistic than those of SKCV. Both regression and classification\ncases are considered in our experiments. In addition, we will show how the SKCV\nmethod can be applied as a criterion for selecting data sampling density for\nnew research area.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 May 2020 19:55:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-01"}

The main reason is that using interpolation\nto align RoI features can result in a lack of accuracy or even loss of location\ninformation. We present the Local-aware Region Convolutional Neural Network\n(LR-CNN), a novel two-stage approach for vehicle detection in aerial imagery.\nWe enhance translation invariance to detect dense vehicles and address the\nboundary quantization issue amongst dense vehicles by aggregating the\nhigh-precision RoIs' features. Moreover, we resample high-level semantic pooled\nfeatures, making them regain location information from the features of a\nshallower convolutional block. This strengthens the local feature invariance\nfor the resampled features and enables detecting vehicles in an arbitrary\norientation. The local feature invariance enhances the learning ability of the\nfocal loss function, and the focal loss further helps to focus on the hard\nexamples. Taken together, our method better addresses the challenges of aerial\nimagery. We evaluate our approach on several challenging datasets (VEDAI,\nDOTA), demonstrating a significant improvement over state-of-the-art methods.\nWe demonstrate the good generalization ability of our approach on the DLR 3K\ndataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 May 2020 19:57:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-01"}

The\nenergy and arrival time of beam photons are tagged using a scintillator\nhodoscope and a scintillating fiber array. The photon flux is determined using\na pair spectrometer, while the linear polarization of the photon beam is\ndetermined using a polarimeter based on triplet photoproduction.\nCharged-particle tracks from interactions in the central target are analyzed in\na solenoidal field using a central straw-tube drift chamber and six packages of\nplanar chambers with cathode strips and drift wires. Electromagnetic showers\nare reconstructed in a cylindrical scintillating fiber calorimeter inside the\nmagnet and a lead-glass array downstream. Charged particle identification is\nachieved by measuring energy loss in the wire chambers and using the flight\ntime of particles between the target and detectors outside the magnet. The\nsignals from all detectors are recorded with flash ADCs and/or pipeline TDCs\ninto memories allowing trigger decisions with a latency of 3.3 $\\mu$s. The\ndetector operates routinely at trigger rates of 40 kHz and data rates of 600\nmegabytes per second.

Since optic disc is the most important part of retinal\nfundus image for glaucoma detection, this paper proposes a two-stage framework\nthat first detects and localizes optic disc and then classifies it into healthy\nor glaucomatous. The first stage is based on RCNN and is responsible for\nlocalizing and extracting optic disc from a retinal fundus image while the\nsecond stage uses Deep CNN to classify the extracted disc into healthy or\nglaucomatous. In addition to the proposed solution, we also developed a\nrule-based semi-automatic ground truth generation method that provides\nnecessary annotations for training RCNN based model for automated disc\nlocalization. The proposed method is evaluated on seven publicly available\ndatasets for disc localization and on ORIGA dataset, which is the largest\npublicly available dataset for glaucoma classification. The results of\nautomatic localization mark new state-of-the-art on six datasets with accuracy\nreaching 100% on four of them. For glaucoma classification we achieved AUC\nequal to 0.874 which is 2.7% relative improvement over the state-of-the-art\nresults previously obtained for classification on ORIGA. Once trained on\ncarefully annotated data, Deep Learning based methods for optic disc detection\nand localization are not only robust, accurate and fully automated but also\neliminates the need for dataset-dependent heuristic algorithms. Our empirical\nevaluation of glaucoma classification on ORIGA reveals that reporting only AUC,\nfor datasets with class imbalance and without pre-defined train and test\nsplits, does not portray true picture of the classifier's performance and calls\nfor additional performance metrics to substantiate the results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 May 2020 20:40:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-01"}

Although its influence on cell response is deeply investigated, the\nrole of the coupling between mechanical processes and multiphysics involving\nthe active receptors and the surrounding lipid membrane during ligand-binding\nhas not yet been understood. Specifically, the focus of this work is on\nG-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), which regulate specific cell processes\nthrough chemical signalling pathways involving a synergistic balance between\nthe cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate (cAMP) produced by active GPCRs in the\nintracellular environment and its efflux, mediated by Multidrug Resistance\nProteins (MRPs) transporters. This paper develops a multiphysics approach based\non the interplay among energetics, multiscale geometrical changes and mass\nbalance of species, i.e. active GPCRs and MRPs, including diffusion and\nkinetics of binding and unbinding. Because the obtained energy depends upon\nboth the kinematics and the changes of species densities, balance of mass and\nof linear momentum are coupled and govern the space-time evolution of the cell\nmembrane. The mechanobiology involving remodelling and change of lipid ordering\nof the cell membrane allows to predict dynamics of transporters and active\nreceptors -in agreement with experimentally observed cAMP levels- and how the\nlatter trigger rafts formation and cluster on such sites. Within the current\nscientific debate on Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoronaVirus 2\n(SARS-CoV-2) and on the basis of the ascertained fact that lipid rafts often\nserve as an entry port for viruses, it is felt that approaches accounting for\nstrong coupling among mechanobiological aspects could even turn helpful in\nbetter understanding membrane-mediated phenomena such as COVID-19 virus-cell\ninteraction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 May 2020 20:51:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-01"}

Model development and selection for\necological community data is difficult because a high level of complexity is\ndesired and achieved by including numerous parameters, which can degrade\npredictive accuracy and be challenging to interpret and communicate. Like other\nstatistical models, multi-species distribution models can be overparameterized.\nRegularization is a technique that optimizes predictive accuracy by shrinking\nor eliminating model parameters.

We propose a\nself-attention based depth and ego-motion network for unrectified images. We\nalso introduce non-differentiable distortion of the camera into the training\npipeline. Our approach performs competitively when compared to other\nestablished approaches that used rectified images for depth estimation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 May 2020 21:53:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-02"}

Specifically, given a\nconversation around a movie, the task is to generate the next response based on\nbackground knowledge about the movie such as the plot, review, Reddit comments\netc. This requires capturing structural, sequential and semantic information\nfrom the conversation context and the background resources. This is a new task\nand has not received much attention from the community. We propose a new\narchitecture that uses the ability of BERT to capture deep contextualized\nrepresentations in conjunction with explicit structure and sequence\ninformation. More specifically, we use (i) Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)\nto capture structural information, (ii) LSTMs to capture sequential information\nand (iii) BERT for the deep contextualized representations that capture\nsemantic information. We analyze the proposed architecture extensively. To this\nend, we propose a plug-and-play Semantics-Sequences-Structures (SSS) framework\nwhich allows us to effectively combine such linguistic information. Through a\nseries of experiments we make some interesting observations. First, we observe\nthat the popular adaptation of the GCN model for NLP tasks where structural\ninformation (GCNs) was added on top of sequential information (LSTMs) performs\npoorly on our task. This leads us to explore interesting ways of combining\nsemantic and structural information to improve the performance. Second, we\nobserve that while BERT already outperforms other deep contextualized\nrepresentations such as ELMo, it still benefits from the additional structural\ninformation explicitly added using GCNs. This is a bit surprising given the\nrecent claims that BERT already captures structural information. Lastly, the\nproposed SSS framework gives an improvement of 7.95% over the baseline.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 May 2020 22:06:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-01"}

By design, data collection\nis simplified by requiring only the distances from a transect to the detected\nindividuals be recorded. Compared to traditional design-based methods that\nrequire restrictive assumption and limit the use of distance sampling data,\nmodel-based approaches enable broader applications such as spatial prediction,\ninferring species-habitat relationships, unbiased estimation from\npreferentially sampled transects, and integration into multi-type data models.\nUnfortunately, model-based approaches require the exact location of each\ndetected individual in order to incorporate environmental and habitat\ncharacteristics as predictor variables. We modified model-based methods for\ndistance sampling data by including a probability distribution that accounts\nfor location uncertainty generated when only the distances are recorded. We\ntested and demonstrated our method using a simulation experiment and by\nmodeling the habitat use of Dickcissels (Spiza americana) using distance\nsampling data collected from the Konza Prairie in Kansas, USA.

Our approach is a\nsignificant advancement for the analysis of distance sampling data because it\nremedies the deleterious effects of location uncertainty and requires only\ndistances be recorded.

High resolution magnetic field measurements are routinely done only\nin the solar photosphere. Higher layers like the chromosphere and corona can be\nmodeled by extrapolating the photospheric magnetic field upward. In the solar\ncorona, plasma forces can be neglected and the Lorentz force vanishes. This is\nnot the case in the upper photosphere and chromosphere where magnetic and\nnon-magnetic forces are equally important. One way to deal with this problem is\nto compute the plasma and magnetic field self-consistently with a\nmagnetohydrostatic (MHS) model.\n  Aims. We aim to derive the magnetic field, plasma pressure and density of\nAR11768 by applying the newly developed extrapolation technique to the\nSUNRISE/IMaX data.\n  Methods. An optimization method is used for the MHS modeling. The initial\nconditions consist of a nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) and a\ngravity-stratified atmosphere.\n  Results. In the non-force-free layer, which is spatially resolved by the new\ncode, Lorentz forces are effectively balanced by the gas pressure gradient\nforce and the gravity force. The pressure and density are depleted in strong\nfield regions, which is consistent with observations. Denser plasma, however,\nis also observed at some parts of the active region edges. In the chromosphere,\nthe fibril-like plasma structures trace the magnetic field nicely.

Based on reasonable\nassumptions, the main relationships among key factors are kept without the\nuncertain impact of subordinate factors in this model. Three vital issues\nrelated to optimal freeway control during an emergency evacuation are\naddressed. How to properly realize some predetermined priorities assigned to\nsome on-ramps during an emergency evacuation is analyzed through sensitivity\nanalysis of objective function coefficients. The time-varying throughput\ncapacity of freeway mainline and the storage capacities of on-ramps are also\naddressed by using sensitivity analysis of the right-hand side (RHS) of\ncorresponding constraints. The last key issue we focused on is how to deal with\nthe uncertain demand in a crude form by applying robust optimization. The\nmethodology presented in this paper can help evacuation managers realize a\ncoordinated ramp metering with predetermined priorities put on some on-ramps\nduring an emergency evacuation. The result obtained by analyzing the impact of\ntime-varying mainline capacity provides the evacuation manager a chance of\nusing the extra capacity in some segments of mainline to buffer the traffic so\nas to reduce the congestion related to upstream on-ramps. To reduce the risk\ndue to the possible infeasibility of deterministic control approaches in an\nuncertain situation, we apply an affinely adjustable robust counterpart (AARC)\napproach to deal with uncertain dynamic demands restricted to polyhedral sets.\nThe preliminary numerical experiments show that the AARC approach provides us\nwith a promising solution comparing to the sampling based stochastic approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 May 2020 00:36:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-01"}

Accordingly, there is a great need for accurate\nvideo quality assessment (VQA) models for UGC/consumer videos to monitor,\ncontrol, and optimize this vast content. Blind quality prediction of\nin-the-wild videos is quite challenging, since the quality degradations of UGC\ncontent are unpredictable, complicated, and often commingled.

Most prominent centrality\nmeasures can be expressed as an aggregation of influence flows between pairs of\nnodes. As there are many ways in which influence can be defined, many different\ncentrality measures are in use. Parametrized centralities allow further\nflexibility and utility by tuning the centrality calculation to the regime most\nappropriate for a given network. Here, we identify two categories of centrality\nparameters. Reach parameters control the attenuation of influence flows between\ndistant nodes. Grasp parameters control the centrality's potential to send\ninfluence flows along multiple, often nongeodesic paths. Combining these\ncategories with Borgatti's centrality types [S. P. Borgatti, Social Networks\n27, 55-71 (2005)], we arrive at a novel classification system for parametrized\ncentralities. Using this classification, we identify the notable absence of any\ncentrality measures that are radial, reach parametrized, and based on acyclic,\nconservative flows of influence. We therefore introduce the ground-current\ncentrality, which is a measure of precisely this type. Because of its unique\nposition in the taxonomy, the ground-current centrality has significant\nadvantages over similar centralities. We demonstrate that, compared to other\nconserved-flow centralities, it has a simpler mathematical description.\nCompared to other reach centralities, it robustly preserves an intuitive rank\nordering across a wide range of network architectures. We also show that it\nproduces a consistent distribution of centrality values among the nodes,\nneither trivially equally spread (delocalization), nor overly focused on a few\nnodes (localization). Other reach centralities exhibit both of these behaviors\non regular networks and hub networks, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 May 2020 00:51:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Jun 2021 20:56:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-04"}

Many methods have been\nproposed and achieved good results, in which the relationships between adjacent\ndata points are mainly concerned. But the possible associations between data\npairs that are may not adjacent are always neglected. Different from previous\nmethods, we propose a novel and very simple approach for unsupervised feature\nselection, named MMFS (Multi-step Markov transition probability for Feature\nSelection). The idea is using multi-step Markov transition probability to\ndescribe the relation between any data pair. Two ways from the positive and\nnegative viewpoints are employed respectively to keep the data structure after\nfeature selection. From the positive viewpoint, the maximum transition\nprobability that can be reached in a certain number of steps is used to\ndescribe the relation between two points. Then, the features which can keep the\ncompact data structure are selected. From the viewpoint of negative, the\nminimum transition probability that can be reached in a certain number of steps\nis used to describe the relation between two points. On the contrary, the\nfeatures that least maintain the loose data structure are selected. And the two\nways can also be combined. Thus three algorithms are proposed. Our main\ncontributions are a novel feature section approach which uses multi-step\ntransition probability to characterize the data structure, and three algorithms\nproposed from the positive and negative aspects for keeping data structure. The\nperformance of our approach is compared with the state-of-the-art methods on\neight real-world data sets, and the experimental results show that the proposed\nMMFS is effective in unsupervised feature selection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 May 2020 01:15:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-01"}

MeerKAT is a high-gain (~2.8 K/Jy)\nlow-system temperature (~18 K at 20cm) radio array that currently operates from\n580-1670 MHz and can produce tied-array beams suitable for pulsar observations.\nThis paper presents results from the MeerTime Large Survey Project and\ncommissioning tests with PTUSE. Highlights include observations of the double\npulsar J0737-3039A, pulse profiles from 34 millisecond pulsars from a single\n2.5h observation of the Globular cluster Terzan 5, the rotation measure of\nTer5O, a 420-sigma giant pulse from the Large Magellanic Cloud pulsar PSR\nJ0540-6919, and nulling identified in the slow pulsar PSR J0633-2015. One of\nthe key design specifications for MeerKAT was absolute timing errors of less\nthan 5 ns using their novel precise time system. Our timing of two bright\nmillisecond pulsars confirm that MeerKAT delivers exceptional timing. PSR\nJ2241-5236 exhibits a jitter limit of <4 ns per hour whilst timing of PSR\nJ1909-3744 over almost 11 months yields an rms residual of 66 ns with only 4\nmin integrations. Our results confirm that the MeerKAT is an exceptional pulsar\ntelescope. The array can be split into four separate sub-arrays to time over\n1000 pulsars per day and the future deployment of S-band (1750-3500 MHz)\nreceivers will further enhance its capabilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 May 2020 02:10:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-22"}

Thickness-dependent\ndielectric screening properties have recently been studied using electrostatic\nforce microscopy (EFM) experiments.

These outer\nbounds depend on the probability that the CSI from both receivers are erased at\nthe transmitter. In particular, if at any time, the CSI from at least one of\nthe two receivers is available at the other two nodes, then the outer-bounds\nmatch the capacity with global delayed CSI. We also provide capacity-achieving\ntransmission strategies under certain scenarios, and we establish a connection\nbetween this problem and Blind Index Coding with feedback.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 May 2020 04:50:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Feb 2021 05:04:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-08"}

In order to alleviate this issue, in this work, we propose a\nsimple and efficient architecture for deep convolutional neural networks to\nfuse a low-resolution hyperspectral image (LR-HSI) and a high-resolution\nmultispectral image (HR-MSI), yielding a high-resolution hyperspectral image\n(HR-HSI).

Most state-of-the-art methods\nperform search that relies on a large number of forward simulations. For\nsystems with complex dynamics, this generally require costly numerical\nintegrations which significantly slows down the planning process.\nLinearization-based methods have been proposed that can alleviate the above\nproblem. However, it is not clear how linearization affects the quality of the\ngenerated motion strategy, and when such simplifications are admissible. We\npropose a non-linearity measure, called Statistical-distance-based\nNon-linearity Measure (SNM), that can identify where linearization is\nbeneficial and where it should be avoided. We show that when the problem is\nframed as the Partially Observable Markov Decision Process, the value\ndifference between the optimal strategy for the original model and the\nlinearized model can be upper bounded by a function linear in SNM. Comparisons\nwith an existing measure on various scenarios indicate that SNM is more\nsuitable in estimating the effectiveness of linearization-based solvers.

Despite taking advantage of\nrecent advances in supervised machine learning, these algorithms remain, in a\nsense, blunt instruments--often being developed and deployed without a full\naccounting of the causal aspects of the prediction problems they are intended\nto solve. Indeed, in many settings, including among patients at risk of\nreadmission, the riskiest patients may derive less benefit from a preventative\nintervention compared to those at lower risk. Moreover, targeting an\nintervention to a population, rather than limiting it to a small group of\nhigh-risk patients, may lead to far greater overall utility if the patients\nwith the most modifiable (or preventable) outcomes across the population could\nbe identified. Based on these insights, we introduce a causal machine learning\nframework that decouples this prediction problem into causal and predictive\nparts, which clearly delineates the complementary roles of causal inference and\nprediction in this problem.

It promises the user services at large scale\nand low cost while eliminating the need for infrastructure management. On cloud\nprovider side, flexible resource management is required to meet fluctuating\ndemand. It can be enabled through automated provisioning and deprovisioning of\nresources. A common approach among both commercial and open source serverless\ncomputing platforms is workload-based auto-scaling, where a designated\nalgorithm scales instances according to the number of incoming requests. In the\nrecently evolving serverless framework Knative a request-based policy is\nproposed, where the algorithm scales resources by a configured maximum number\nof requests that can be processed in parallel per instance, the so-called\nconcurrency. As we show in a baseline experiment, this predefined concurrency\nlevel can strongly influence the performance of a serverless application.\nHowever, identifying the concurrency configuration that yields the highest\npossible quality of service is a challenging task due to various factors, e.g.\nvarying workload and complex infrastructure characteristics, influencing\nthroughput and latency. While there has been considerable research into\nintelligent techniques for optimizing auto-scaling for virtual machine\nprovisioning, this topic has not yet been discussed in the area of serverless\ncomputing. For this reason, we investigate the applicability of a reinforcement\nlearning approach, which has been proven on dynamic virtual machine\nprovisioning, to request-based auto-scaling in a serverless framework.

Through the induction of electric currents, human\ninfrastructures are also affected, namely the equipment of electric power\ntransmission networks. It was shown in past studies that the rate of power-grid\nanomalies may increase after an exposure to strong geomagnetically induced\ncurrents. We search for a rapid response of devices in the Czech electric\ndistribution grid to disturbed days of high geomagnetic activity. Such\ndisturbed days are described either by the cumulative storm-time $Dst$ or\n$d(\\textit{SYM-H})/dt$ low-latitude indices mainly influenced by ring current\nvariations, by the cumulative $AE$ high-latitude index measuring\nsubstorm-related auroral current variations, or by the cumulative $ap$\nmid-latitude index measuring both ring and auroral current variations. We use\nsuperposed epoch analysis to identify possible increases of anomaly rates\nduring and after such disturbed days. We show that in the case of abundant\nseries of anomalies on power lines, the anomaly rate increases significantly\nimmediately (within 1 day) after the onset of geomagnetic storms. In the case\nof transformers, the increase of the anomaly rate is generally delayed by 2--3\ndays. We also find that transformers and some electric substations seem to be\nsensitive to a prolonged exposure to substorms, with a delayed increase of\nanomalies. Overall, we show that in the 5-day period following the commencement\nof geomagnetic activity there is an approximately 5--10\\% increase in the\nrecorded anomalies in the Czech power grid and thus this fraction of anomalies\nis probably related to an exposure to GICs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 May 2020 08:43:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-06"}

Neural architecture searching is a way of automatically\nexploring optimal deep neural networks in a given huge search space. However,\nall sub-networks are usually evaluated using the same criterion; that is, early\nstopping on a small proportion of the training dataset, which is an inaccurate\nand highly complex approach. In contrast to conventional methods, here we\npresent a divide-and-conquer (DC) approach to effectively and efficiently\nsearch deep neural architectures. Given an arbitrary search space, we first\nextract feature representations of all sub-networks according to changes in\nparameters or output features of each layer, and then calculate the similarity\nbetween two different sampled networks based on the representations. Then, a\nk-means clustering is conducted to aggregate similar architectures into the\nsame cluster, separately executing sub-network evaluation in each cluster. The\nbest architecture in each cluster is later merged to obtain the optimal neural\narchitecture. Experimental results conducted on several benchmarks illustrate\nthat DC-NAS can overcome the inaccurate evaluation problem, achieving a\n$75.1\\%$ top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet dataset, which is higher than that of\nstate-of-the-art methods using the same search space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 May 2020 09:02:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-01"}

The phase space restrictions are $0.5 < m_{\\pi\\pi} <\n2.2$ GeV, ${\\vert t\\vert < 1.5}$ GeV${}^2$, and ${20 < W_{\\gamma p} < 80}$ GeV.\nCross section measurements are presented for both elastic and\nproton-dissociative scattering. The observed cross section dependencies are\ndescribed by analytic functions. Parametrising the $m_{\\pi\\pi}$ dependence with\nresonant and non-resonant contributions added at the amplitude level leads to a\nmeasurement of the $\\rho^{0}(770)$ meson mass and width at $m_\\rho = 770.8\\\n{}^{+2.6}_{-2.7}$ (tot) MeV and $\\Gamma_\\rho = 151.3\\ {}^{+2.7}_{-3.6}$ (tot)\nMeV, respectively.

Extracting\npatterns of disease variable progression for subtypes has tremendous\napplication in medicine, for example, in early prognosis and personalized\nmedical therapy. This work present a novel, data-driven, network-based\nTrajectory Clustering (TC) algorithm for identifying Parkinson's subtypes based\non disease trajectory. Modeling patient-variable interactions as a bipartite\nnetwork, TC first extracts communities of co-expressing disease variables at\ndifferent stages of progression. Then, it identifies Parkinson's subtypes by\nclustering similar patient trajectories that are characterized by severity of\ndisease variables through a multi-layer network. Determination of trajectory\nsimilarity accounts for direct overlaps between trajectories as well as\nsecond-order similarities, i.e., common overlap with a third set of\ntrajectories. This work clusters trajectories across two types of layers: (a)\ntemporal, and (b) ranges of independent outcome variable (representative of\ndisease severity), both of which yield four distinct subtypes. The former\nsubtypes exhibit differences in progression of disease domains (Cognitive,\nMental Health etc.), whereas the latter subtypes exhibit different degrees of\nprogression, i.e., some remain mild, whereas others show significant\ndeterioration after 5 years. The TC approach is validated through statistical\nanalyses and consistency of the identified subtypes with medical literature.\nThis generalizable and robust method can easily be extended to other\nprogressive multi-variate disease datasets, and can effectively assist in\ntargeted subtype-specific treatment in the field of personalized medicine.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 May 2020 09:44:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Aug 2020 15:12:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-04"}

We employ mathematical\nmodelling (chemical network theory) and cellular automata based computer\nsimulations to study the human cost of an epidemic spread and an effective\nstrategy to introduce HI. Implementation of different strategies to counter the\nspread of the disease requires a certain degree of quantitative understanding\nof the time dependence of the outcome.

We generalize the celebrated SIR model (Susceptible-Infected-Removed) by\ncompartmentalizing the susceptible population into two categories- (i)\nvulnerables and (ii) resilients, and study dynamical evolution of the disease\nprogression. We achieve such a classification by employing different rates of\nrecovery of vulnerables vis-a-vis resilients.

Triple Graph\nGrammars (TGGs) specify model consistency by means of rules that describe how\nto create consistent pairs of models. These rules can be used to automatically\nderive further rules, which describe how to propagate changes from one model to\nthe other or how to change one model in such a way that propagation is\nguaranteed to be possible. Restricting model synchronization to these derived\nrules, however, may lead to unnecessary deletion and recreation of model\nelements during change propagation. This is inefficient and may cause\nunnecessary information loss, i.e., when deleted elements contain information\nthat is not represented in the second model, this information cannot be\nrecovered easily. Short-cut rules have recently been developed to avoid\nunnecessary information loss by reusing existing model elements. In this paper,\nwe show how to automatically derive (short-cut) repair rules from short-cut\nrules to propagate changes such that information loss is avoided and model\nsynchronization is accelerated. The key ingredients of our rule-based model\nsynchronization process are these repair rules and an incremental pattern\nmatcher informing about suitable applications of them. We prove the termination\nand the correctness of this synchronization process and discuss its\ncompleteness.

By changing the polarization of incoming\nphotons, we demonstrate that for ReSe$_{2}$, in contrast to the 2H materials,\nthe out-of-plane transition metal $d_{z^{2}}$ and chalcogen $p_{z}$ orbitals do\nnot contribute significantly to the top of the valence band which explains the\nreported weak changes in the electronic structure of this compound as a\nfunction of layer number. We estimate a band gap of 1.7 eV in pristine\nReSe$_{2}$ using scanning tunneling spectroscopy and explore the implications\non the gap following surface-doping with potassium. A lower bound of 1.4 eV is\nestimated for the gap in the fully doped case, suggesting that doping-dependent\nmany-body effects significantly affect the electronic properties of ReSe$_{2}$.\nOur results, supported by density functional theory calculations, provide\ninsight into the mechanisms behind polarization-dependent optical properties of\nrhenium dichalcogenides and highlight their place amongst two-dimensional\ncrystals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 May 2020 12:24:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-04"}

This\nmaterial, although being known for quite a while, has received recent\nsignificant attention in a context of the use of van der Waals magnets in novel\nspintronic devices. Temperature-dependent measurements of the resonance fields\nwere performed between 4 and 175 K and with the external magnetic field applied\nparallel and perpendicular to the honeycomb planes of the crystal structure.\nThese investigations reveal that the resonance line shifts from the\nparamagnetic resonance position already at temperatures well above the\ntransition into a magnetically ordered state.

To study details of the magnetic anisotropies in the field-induced\neffectively ferromagnetic state at low temperatures, frequency-dependent\nferromagnetic resonance (FMR) measurements were conducted at 4 K. The observed\nanisotropy between the two magnetic-field orientations is analyzed by means of\nnumerical simulations based on a phenomenological theory of FMR. These\nsimulations are in excellent agreement with measured data if the shape\nanisotropy of the studied crystal is taken into account, while the\nmagnetocrystalline anisotropy is found to be negligible in CrCl$_3$.

In our experiment, an intense sub-picosecond laser pulse\npropagates through a plasma of a near critical electron density (NCD) and\ndirect laser acceleration (DLA) of electrons takes place. The breakthrough\ntoward high current relativistic electron beams became possible due to\napplication of low density polymer foams of sub-mm thickness. In foams, the\nNCD-plasma was produced by a mechanism of super-sonic ionization. Compared to\nNCD-plasmas generated by laser irradiation of conventional foils, the DLA\nacceleration path in foams was strongly enhanced. Measurements resulted into\n11{\\div}13 MeV of the effective electron temperature and up to 100 MeV maximum\nof the electron energy measured in the laser pulse propagation direction.

To power backscattering-based and\nwireless-powered devices, the ISP has to contract with an energy service\nprovider (ESP). This article studies the strategic interactions between the ISP\nand its ESP and their implications on the joint optimal time scheduling and\nenergy trading for heterogeneous devices. To that end, we propose an economic\nframework using the Stackelberg game to maximize the network throughput and\nenergy efficiency of both the ISP and ESP. Specifically, the ISP leads the game\nby sending its optimal service time and energy price request (that maximizes\nits profit) to the ESP. The ESP then optimizes and supplies the transmission\npower which satisfies the ISP's request (while maximizing ESP's utility). To\nobtain the Stackelberg equilibrium (SE), we apply a backward induction\ntechnique which first derives a closed-form solution for the ESP. Then, to\ntackle the non-convex optimization problem for the ISP, we leverage the block\ncoordinate descent and convex-concave procedure techniques to design two\npartitioning schemes (i.e., partial adjustment (PA) and joint adjustment (JA))\nto find the optimal energy price and service time that constitute local SEs.\nNumerical results reveal that by jointly optimizing the energy trading and the\ntime allocation for heterogeneous IoT devices, one can achieve significant\nimprovements in terms of the ISP's profit compared with those of conventional\ntransmission methods. Different tradeoffs between the ESP's and ISP's profits\nand complexities of the PA/JA schemes can also be numerically tuned.\nSimulations also show that the obtained local SEs approach the socially optimal\nwelfare when the ISP's benefit per transmitted bit is higher than a given\nthreshold.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 May 2020 13:51:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 31 Aug 2020 14:00:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-01"}

One objective\nof the project is to apply distributional semantic models to terminological\nentries, that is, complex lexical data comprising of at least one or several\nterms, term phrases and a definition. This application is needed to solve a\nmore complex problem: the harmonization of terminologies of standards and\nstandards bodies (i.e. resolution of doublettes and inconsistencies). Due to a\nlack of evaluation data sets for terminological entries, the creation of\nHarbsafe-162 was a necessary step towards harmonization assistance.\nHarbsafe-162 covers data from nine electrotechnical standards in the domain of\nfunctional safety, IT security, and dependability. An intrinsic evaluation\nmethod in the form of a similarity rating task has been applied in which two\nlinguists and three domain experts from standardization participated. The data\nset is used to evaluate a specific implementation of an established sentence\nembedding model. This implementation proves to be satisfactory for the\ndomain-specific data so that further implementations for harmonization\nassistance may be brought forward by the project. Considering recent criticism\non intrinsic evaluation methods, the article concludes with an evaluation of\nHarbsafe-162 and joins a more general discussion about the nature of similarity\nrating tasks.

In this work, we address this challenge by\nproposing a neural network approach capable of accurately approximating and\ncompensating for such modelling errors in augmented direct and inverse\nproblems. The viability of the approach is demonstrated using simulated and\nexperimental data arising from differing physical direct and inverse problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 May 2020 14:20:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 Jan 2021 08:12:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-17"}

Firstly, we use a regular convolution neural\nnetwork as a feature extractor to generate high-level features of input images.\nThen, for each relationship triplet in input images, i.e.,\n$<$subject-predicate-object$>$, we apply ROI-pooling to get feature vectors of\ntwo regions on the feature maps that corresponding to bounding boxes of the\nsubject and object.

The generated feature vector is then feed into a fully\nconnected neural network to get predicate classification results.

Linear stability, weakly nonlinear and fully nonlinear analyses are\nperformed, revealing that each of the solutions arises from the destabilisation\nof uniform suspension. The discrete number of the solutions is due to the\nfinite flow domain, while the transcritical nature of the bifurcation is\nbecause of the cylindrical geometry which breaks the horizontal symmetry of the\nsystem. It is further shown that there exists a maximum threshold of achievable\ndownward flow rate for each solution if the flow is to remain steady, as\nvarying the pressure gradient can no longer increase the flow rate from the\nsolution. Except the one arising at the lowest Richardson number, all of the\nsolutions found are unstable, implying that they would play a role in the\ntransient dynamics in the route from a uniform suspension to the\nfully-developed gyrotactic pattern.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 May 2020 14:47:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 29 Jul 2020 14:42:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-30"}

Our main\ntheorem shows that a currency network, where agents can be members of more than\none currency community, can achieve distributive justice globally across the\nnetwork by joint egalitarian minting, whereby each agent mints one coin in only\none community at each timestep. Specifically, we show that a sufficiently large\nintersection between two communities -- relative to the gap in their\nproductivity -- will cause the exchange rates between their currencies to\nconverge to 1:1, resulting in global distributive justice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 May 2020 15:49:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Jun 2020 15:52:10 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 5 Jul 2020 10:45:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-07"}

A face presentation attack detection model with good\ngeneralization can be obtained when it is trained with face images from\ndifferent input distributions and different types of spoof attacks. In reality,\ntraining data (both real face images and spoof images) are not directly shared\nbetween data owners due to legal and privacy issues. In this paper, with the\nmotivation of circumventing this challenge, we propose Federated Face\nPresentation Attack Detection (FedPAD) framework. FedPAD simultaneously takes\nadvantage of rich fPAD information available at different data owners while\npreserving data privacy. In the proposed framework, each data owner (referred\nto as \\textit{data centers}) locally trains its own fPAD model. A server learns\na global fPAD model by iteratively aggregating model updates from all data\ncenters without accessing private data in each of them. Once the learned global\nmodel converges, it is used for fPAD inference.

Object segmentation is one such task: its aim is to\nprecisely locate boundaries of objects and classify the identified objects,\nhelping autonomous cars to recognise the road environment and the traffic\nsituation. Not only is this task safety critical, but developing a DNN based\nobject segmentation module presents a set of challenges that are significantly\ndifferent from traditional development of safety critical software. The\ndevelopment process in use consists of multiple iterations of data collection,\nlabelling, training, and evaluation. Among these stages, training and\nevaluation are computation intensive while data collection and labelling are\nmanual labour intensive. This paper shows how development of DNN based object\nsegmentation can be improved by exploiting the correlation between Surprise\nAdequacy (SA) and model performance. The correlation allows us to predict model\nperformance for inputs without manually labelling them. This, in turn, enables\nunderstanding of model performance, more guided data collection, and informed\ndecisions about further training.

The fixed link flow results of a static\ntraffic assignment model (TAM) make it nearly impossible to investigate and\nmake use of the actual evolution of congested zones over the network during the\npredetermined observation time period. Many methods, such as TAMs with\nside-constraints on link flow capacity and the pseudo dynamic traffic\nassignment based on day-by-day traffic, have been proposed to improve the\nreliability of the results of TAM, but cannot eliminate the problem. To resolve\nthe above problems, we first uncover the origin of problem by analyzing the\nconnection between the link travel time function and the fundamental diagram of\ntraffic flow theory. According to the above connection a mapping is formulated\nto reflect the two branches of the fundamental diagram. Then with the\nassumption that the link flow states are given, new traffic assignment models\nare presented. To resolve the obtained non-convex user equilibrium model, a\nbranch-and-bound algorithm is designed based on linearizing the nonlinear part\nof the objective function. At last, by repeatedly resolving the corresponding\ntraffic assignment model with the renewed initial flow states of links, the\nevolution of congested zones during the observation time period can be\nreproduced and investigated. The numerical examples demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the new approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 May 2020 00:45:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-02"}

Two\nclasses of multiwavelets are used to achieve multiresolution, which are the\northonormal Alpert's multiwavelets and the interpolatory multiwavelets.\nNumerical tests in up to four dimensions are provided to validate the\nperformance of the method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 May 2020 14:13:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-14"}

This seeming\ncontradiction has encouraged scholars and policy makers to explore the true\neffects of RTAs, including both regional and global trade relationships. This\npaper defines synthesized trade resistance and decomposes it into natural and\nartificial factors. Here, we separate the influence of geographical distance,\neconomic volume, overall increases in transportation and labor costs and use\nthe expectation maximization algorithm to optimize the parameters and quantify\nthe trade purity indicator, which describes the true global trade environment\nand relationships among countries. This indicates that although global and most\nregional trade relations gradually deteriorated during the period 2007-2017,\nRTAs generate trade relations among members, especially contributing to the\nrelative prosperity of EU and NAFTA countries. In addition, we apply the\nnetwork to reflect the purity of the trade relations among countries. The\neffects of RTAs can be analyzed by comparing typical trade unions and trade\ncommunities, which are presented using an empirical network structure. This\nanalysis shows that the community structure is quite consistent with some trade\nunions, and the representative RTAs constitute the core structure of\ninternational trade network. However, the role of trade unions has weakened,\nand multilateral trade liberalization has accelerated in the past decade. This\nmeans that more countries have recently tended to expand their trading partners\noutside of these unions rather than limit their trading activities to RTAs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 May 2020 07:53:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-15"}

I discuss a range of lessons learned from Voyager, broadly grouped\ninto process, planning, and people. In terms of process, we must be open to new\nconcepts: reliance on existing instrument technologies, propulsion systems, and\noperational modes is inherently limiting. I cite examples during recent decades\nthat could open new vistas in exploration of the deep outer Solar System.\nPlanning is crucial: mission gaps that last over three decades leave much scope\nfor evolution both in mission development and in the targets themselves. I\ntouch only briefly on planetary science, as that is covered in other papers in\nthis issue, but the role of the decadal surveys will be examined in this\nsection. I also sketch out how coordination of distinct and divergent\ninternational planning timelines yields both challenges and opportunity.\nFinally, I turn to people: with generational-length gaps between missions,\ncontinuity in knowledge and skills requires careful attention to people. The\nyoungest participants in the Voyager missions (myself included) now approach\nretirement. We share here ideas for preparing the next generation of voyagers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 May 2020 15:38:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 28 Jul 2020 18:48:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-04"}

Here we report turn-on fluorescent naphthalimide chemosensors containing\nmonoaza- and diaza-crown ethers as agents for single Ba$^{2+}$ detection.\nMonoaza-18-crown-6 ether naphthalimide sensors showed sensitivity primarily to\nBa$^{2+}$ and Hg$^{2+}$, whereas two diaza-18-crown-6 ether naphthalimides\nrevealed a desirable selectivity toward Ba$^{2+}$. Solution-phase fluorescence\nand NMR experiments support a photoinduced electron transfer mechanism enabling\nturn-on fluorescence sensing in the presence of barium ions. Changes in\nion-receptor interactions enable effective selectivity between competitive\nbarium, mercury, and potassium ions, with detailed calculations correctly\npredicting fluorescence responses. With these molecules, dry-phase single\nBa$^{2+}$ ion imaging with turn-on fluorescence is realized using oil-free\nmicroscopy techniques. This represents a significant advance toward a practical\nmethod of single Ba$^{2+}$ detection within large volumes of $^{136}$Xe,\nplausibly enabling a background-free technique to search for the hypothetical\nprocess of $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 May 2020 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-19"}

Although IP Geolocation is an ongoing field of research for over one\ndecade, it is still a challenging task, whereas good results are only achieved\nby the use of active latency measurements. Nevertheless, an increased accuracy\nis needed to improve service quality. This paper presents an novel approach to\nfind optimized Landmark positions which are used for active probing. Since a\nreasonable Landmark selection is important for a highly accurate localization\nservice, the goal is to find Landmarks close to the target with respect to the\ninfrastructure and hop count. Furthermore, we introduce a new approach of an\nadaptable and more accurate mathematical modelling of an improved geographical\nlocation estimation process. Current techniques provide less information about\nsolving the Landmark problem as well as are using imprecise models. We\ndemonstrate the usability of our approach in a real-world environment and\nanalyse Geolocation for the first time in Europe.
