In many methods, however, only one meaning is\nconsidered for one label of a word, and multiple meanings of polysemous words\ndepending on the context are rarely handled. Although research works have dealt\nwith polysemous words, they determine the meanings of such words according to a\nbatch of large documents. Hence, there are two problems with applying these\nmethods to sequential sentences, as in a conversation that contains ambiguous\nexpressions. The first problem is that the methods cannot sequentially deal\nwith the interdependence between context and word interpretation, in which\ncontext is decided by word interpretations and the word interpretations are\ndecided by the context. Context estimation must thus be performed in parallel\nto pursue multiple interpretations. The second problem is that the previous\nmethods use large-scale sets of sentences for offline learning of new\ninterpretations, and the steps of learning and inference are clearly separated.\nSuch methods using offline learning cannot obtain new interpretations during a\nconversation. Hence, to dynamically estimate the conversation context and\ninterpretations of polysemous words in sequential sentences, we propose a\nmethod of Simultaneous Contextualization And INterpreting (SCAIN) based on the\ntraditional Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) algorithm. By using\nthe SCAIN algorithm, we can sequentially optimize the interdependence between\ncontext and word interpretation while obtaining new interpretations online. For\nexperimental evaluation, we created two datasets: one from Wikipedia's\ndisambiguation pages and the other from real conversations. For both datasets,\nthe results confirmed that SCAIN could effectively achieve sequential\noptimization of the interdependence and acquisition of new interpretations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 May 2020 16:40:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-01"}

In the last few years, these\nmethods have become extremely popular as a replacement for manual feature\nengineering. Since authors use various approaches for the evaluation of node\nembedding methods, existing studies can rarely be efficiently and accurately\ncompared. We address this issue by developing a process for a fair and\nobjective evaluation of node embedding procedures w.r.t. node classification.\nThis process supports researchers and practitioners to compare new and existing\nmethods in a reproducible way. We apply this process to four popular node\nembedding methods and make valuable observations. With an appropriate\ncombination of hyperparameters, good performance can be achieved even with\nembeddings of lower dimensions, which is positive for the run times of the\ndownstream machine learning task and the embedding algorithm. Multiple\nhyperparameter combinations yield similar performance. Thus, no extensive,\ntime-consuming search is required to achieve reasonable performance in most\ncases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 May 2020 17:20:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-01"}

They ignore exploring the spatial significance of feature maps,\neventually degrading the vehicle re-identification performance. In this paper,\nfirstly, an innovative spatial graph network (SGN) is proposed to elaborately\nexplore the spatial significance of feature maps. The SGN stacks multiple\nspatial graphs (SGs). Each SG assigns feature map's elements as nodes and\nutilizes spatial neighborhood relationships to determine edges among nodes.\nDuring the SGN's propagation, each node and its spatial neighbors on an SG are\naggregated to the next SG. On the next SG, each aggregated node is re-weighted\nwith a learnable parameter to find the significance at the corresponding\nlocation. Secondly, a novel pyramidal graph network (PGN) is designed to\ncomprehensively explore the spatial significance of feature maps at multiple\nscales. The PGN organizes multiple SGNs in a pyramidal manner and makes each\nSGN handles feature maps of a specific scale. Finally, a hybrid pyramidal graph\nnetwork (HPGN) is developed by embedding the PGN behind a ResNet-50 based\nbackbone network. Extensive experiments on three large scale vehicle databases\n(i.e., VeRi776, VehicleID, and VeRi-Wild) demonstrate that the proposed HPGN is\nsuperior to state-of-the-art vehicle re-identification approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 May 2020 17:21:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Jun 2020 02:23:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-13"}

Examples\ninclude collaboration, organisational affiliations, and trade-blocs. The study\nof such systems is commonly approached through network analysis. Multilayer\nnetworks extend the representation of network analysis to include more\ninformation through increased dimensionality. Thus, they are able to more\naccurately represent the systems they are modelling. However, multilayer\nnetworks are often represented by rank-4 adjacency tensors, resulting in a N2M2\nsolution space. Single-affiliation systems are unable to occupy the full extent\nof this space leading to sparse data where it is difficult to attain\nstatistical confidence through subsequent analysis. To overcome these\nlimitations, this paper presents a rank-3 tensor representation for\nsingle-affiliation systems. The representations is able to maintain full\ninformation of single-affiliation networks in directionless networks, maintain\nnear full information in directed networks, reduce the solution space it\nresides in (N2M) leading to statistically significant findings, and maintain\nthe analytical capability of multilayer approaches.

The parametric instability grows and\ngenerates turbulence that transports angular momentum with stress parameter\n$\\alpha \\sim 5 \\times 10^{-3}$ at distances $\\lesssim 7 \\;a_{bin} $, where\n$a_{bin}$ is the binary semi-major axis.

In steady state, dust particles\nwith Stokes numbers ${\\it St} \\lesssim 0.1$ form a layer of finite thickness\n$H_d \\gtrsim 0.1 H$, where $H$ is the gas scale height.

These swarms have to be\ncoordinated with respect to various desired observations. Such coordination are\nso complicated that distributed swarm controllers cannot always coordinate\nenough astrobots to fulfill the minimum data desired to be obtained in the\ncourse of observations. Thus, a convergence verification is necessary to check\nthe suitability of a coordination before its execution. However, a formal\nverification method does not exist for this purpose. In this paper, we instead\nuse machine learning to predict the convergence of astrobots swarm. In\nparticular, we propose a weighted $k$-NN-based algorithm which requires the\ninitial status of a swarm as well as its observational targets to predict its\nconvergence. Our algorithm learns to predict based on the coordination data\nobtained from previous coordination of the desired swarm. This method first\ngenerates a convergence probability for each astrobot based on a distance\nmetric. Then, these probabilities are transformed to either a complete or an\nincomplete categorical result. The method is applied to two typical swarms\nincluding 116 and 487 astrobots.

The examination of the structural properties by X-ray\ndiffraction evidences that the nanowires crystallize in the wurtzite phase,\nelongate along the c-axis, and are randomly oriented in plane. The luminescence\nof the ZnO nanowires, investigated by photoluminescence and cathodoluminescence\nspectroscopies, is characterized by two bands, the nearband-edge emission and\nthe characteristic defect-related green luminescence of ZnO. The\ncross-correlation of scanning electron micrographs and monochromatic\ncathodoluminescence intensity maps reveals that: (i) coalescence joints act as\na source of non-radiative recombination, and (ii) the luminescence of ZnO\nnanowires is inhomogeneously distributed at the single nanowire level.\nSpecifically, the near-band-edge emission arises from the nanowire cores, while\nthe defect-related green luminescence originates from the volume close to the\nnanowire sidewalls. Two-dimensional simulations of the optical guided modes\nsupported by ZnO nanowires allow us to exclude waveguiding effects as the\nunderlying reason for the luminescence inhomogeneities.

Despite this similarity, GMCs with\ndifferent profiles show dramatically different modes of star formation. For\nshallower profiles, GMCs first fragment into many self-gravitation cores and\nform sub-clusters that distributed throughout the entire clouds. These\nsub-clusters are later assembled ``hierarchically'' to central clusters. In\ncontrast, for steeper profiles, a massive cluster is quickly formed at the\ncenter of the cloud and then gradually grows its mass via gas accretion.\nConsequently, central clusters that emerged from clouds with shallower profiles\nare less massive and show less rotation than those with the steeper profiles.\nThis is because 1) a significant fraction of mass and angular momentum in\nshallower profiles is stored in the orbital motion of the sub-clusters that are\nnot able to merge into the central clusters 2) frequent hierarchical mergers in\nthe shallower profiles lead to further losses of mass and angular momentum via\nviolent relaxation and tidal disruption. Encouragingly, the degree of cluster\nrotations in steeper profiles is consistent with recent observations of young\nand intermediate-age clusters.

Since gene expression is regulated by proteins such\nas transcription factors (TFs), the full set of proteins within the cell\nconstitutes a large system of interacting components. Here, we explore factors\naffecting the stability of this system by coupling the dynamics of mRNAs and\nprotein concentrations in a growing cell. We find that it is possible for\nprotein concentrations to become unstable if the regulation strengths or system\nsize becomes too large, and that other global structural features of the\nnetworks can dramatically enhance the stability of the system. In particular,\ngiven the same number of proteins, TFs, number of interactions, and regulation\nstrengths, a network that resembles a bipartite graph with a lower fraction of\ninteractions that target TFs has a higher chance of being stable. By scrambling\nthe $\\textit{E. coli.}$ transcription network, we find that the randomized\nnetwork with the same number of regulatory interactions is much more likely to\nbe unstable than the real network.

One important source of variability that can significantly\nlimit observer performance is variation in the objects to-be-imaged. This\nsource of variability can be described by stochastic object models (SOMs). A\nSOM is a generative model that can be employed to establish an ensemble of\nto-be-imaged objects with prescribed statistical properties. In order to\naccurately model variations in anatomical structures and object textures, it is\ndesirable to establish SOMs from experimental imaging measurements acquired by\nuse of a well-characterized imaging system. Deep generative neural networks,\nsuch as generative adversarial networks (GANs) hold great potential for this\ntask. However, conventional GANs are typically trained by use of reconstructed\nimages that are influenced by the effects of measurement noise and the\nreconstruction process. To circumvent this, an AmbientGAN has been proposed\nthat augments a GAN with a measurement operator. However, the original\nAmbientGAN could not immediately benefit from modern training procedures, such\nas progressive growing, which limited its ability to be applied to\nrealistically sized medical image data. To circumvent this, in this work, a new\nProgressive Growing AmbientGAN (ProAmGAN) strategy is developed for\nestablishing SOMs from medical imaging measurements. Stylized numerical studies\ncorresponding to common medical imaging modalities are conducted to demonstrate\nand validate the proposed method for establishing SOMs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 May 2020 18:45:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-02"}

Sequential\ncontrol in these systems is largely based on discrete events, while their\nformal execution semantics is specified as Control Interpreted Petri Nets\n(CIPN). Despite industry-wide use of programming languages based on the CIPN\nformalism, formal verification of such control applications in the presence of\nadversarial activity is not supported. Consequently, in this paper we focus on\nsecurity-aware modeling and verification challenges for CIPN-based sequential\ncontrol applications.

Moreover,\nwe show how verification results can be utilized to introduce security patches\nand motivate design of attack detectors that improve overall system resiliency,\nand allow satisfaction of critical safety properties. Finally, we evaluate our\nframework on an industrial case study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 May 2020 19:26:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-02"}

This coupled dynamics coevolves with\ndynamical changes of the topology of the network caused by a link rewiring\nmechanism. Such coevolution model features the interaction of the local\ndynamics of node and link states with the nonlocal dynamics of link-rewiring in\na random network. The coupled dynamics of the states of the nodes and the links\nproduces by itself an absorbing phase transition which is shown to be robust\nagainst the link rewiring mechanism. However, the dynamics of the network gives\nrise to significant physical changes, specially in the limit in which some\nlinks do not change state but are always rewired: First a network fragmentation\noccurs at the critical line of the absorbing transition, and only at this line,\nso that fragmentation is a manifestation of criticality.

Behaviors of and\ninteractions between viruses, vectors, hosts, and the environment each play a\npart in determining the transmission of a disease. Public health surveillance\nsystems and other sources provide valuable data that can be used to accurately\nforecast disease incidence. However, many aspects of common infectious disease\nsurveillance data are imperfect: cases may be reported with a delay or in some\ncases not at all, data on vectors may not be available, and case data may not\nbe available at high geographical or temporal resolution. In the face of these\nchallenges, researchers must make assumptions to either account for these\nunderlying processes in a mechanistic model or to justify their exclusion\naltogether in a statistical model. Whether a model is mechanistic or\nstatistical, researchers should evaluate their model using accepted best\npractices from the emerging field of infectious disease forecasting while\nadopting conventions from other fields that have been developing forecasting\nmethods for decades. Accounting for assumptions and properly evaluating models\nwill allow researchers to generate forecasts that have the potential to provide\nvaluable insights for public health officials.

With self-attention\nand semi-supervised learning components, the U-net-based architecture can\ngenerate high resolution (256x256px) outputs, as necessary for mammography.\nWhen augmenting the original training set with the GAN-generated samples, we\nfind a significant improvement in malignancy classification performance on a\ntest set of real mammogram patches. Overall, the empirical results of our\nalgorithm and the relevance to other medical imaging paradigms point to\npotentially fruitful further applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 May 2020 21:23:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-02"}

The neural ODE's\ndynamics can be chosen almost arbitrarily while ensuring invertibility.\nMoreover, the log-determinant of the flow's Jacobian can be obtained by\nintegrating the trace of the dynamics' Jacobian along the flow. Our proposed\nOT-Flow approach tackles two critical computational challenges that limit a\nmore widespread use of CNFs. First, OT-Flow leverages optimal transport (OT)\ntheory to regularize the CNF and enforce straight trajectories that are easier\nto integrate. Second, OT-Flow features exact trace computation with time\ncomplexity equal to trace estimators used in existing CNFs. On five\nhigh-dimensional density estimation and generative modeling tasks, OT-Flow\nperforms competitively to state-of-the-art CNFs while on average requiring\none-fourth of the number of weights with an 8x speedup in training time and 24x\nspeedup in inference.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 May 2020 22:31:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Jun 2020 17:50:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2020 19:20:54 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2021 19:50:14 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 2021 20:30:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-10"}

The Ideal Observer (IO) performance\nhas been advocated to provide a figure-of-merit for use in assessing and\noptimizing imaging systems because the IO sets an upper performance limit among\nall observers. When joint signal detection and localization tasks are\nconsidered, the IO that employs a modified generalized likelihood ratio test\nmaximizes observer performance as characterized by the localization receiver\noperating characteristic (LROC) curve. Computations of likelihood ratios are\nanalytically intractable in the majority of cases. Therefore, sampling-based\nmethods that employ Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques have been\ndeveloped to approximate the likelihood ratios. However, the applications of\nMCMC methods have been limited to relatively simple object models. Supervised\nlearning-based methods that employ convolutional neural networks have been\nrecently developed to approximate the IO for binary signal detection tasks. In\nthis paper, the ability of supervised learning-based methods to approximate the\nIO for joint signal detection and localization tasks is explored.

We present observational evidence for triggered star formation\nrelating three generations of stars in the neighbourhood of the star LS II +26\n8. We carried out new spectroscopic observations of LS II +26 8, revealing that\nit is a B0 III-type star. We note that LS II +26 8 is located exactly at the\ngeometric centre of a semi-shell-like Hii region complex. The most conspicuous\ncomponent of this complex is the Hii region Sh2-90, which is probably\ntriggering a new generation of stars. The distances to LS II +26 8 and to\nSh2-90 are in agreement (between 2.6 and 3 kpc). Analysis of the interstellar\nmedium on a larger spatial scale shows that Hii region complex lies on the\nnorthwestern border of an extended H2 shell. The radius of this molecular shell\nis about 13 pc, which is in agreement with what an O9V star (the probable\ninitial spectral type of LS II +26 8 as inferred from evolutive tracks) can\ngenerate through its winds in the molecular environment.

Mechanical\ninstabilities in the active cytoskeleton network and feedback loops in the\nbiochemical network of activators and repressors of cytoskeleton dynamics have\nbeen invoked to explain these dynamical features. Here, we show that the\ninterplay between the dynamics of cell-substrate adhesion and linear cellular\nmechanics is sufficient to reproduce many non-linear dynamical patterns\nobserved in spreading and crawling cells. Using an analytical formalism of the\nmolecular clutch model of cell adhesion, regulated by local mechanical forces,\nwe show that cellular traction forces exhibit a stick-slip dynamics resulting\nin periodic waves of protrusion/retraction and propagating waves along the cell\nedge. This can explain spontaneous symmetry breaking and polarisation of\nspreading cells, leading to steady crawling or bipedal motion, and bistability,\nwhere persistent cell motion requires a sufficiently strong transient external\nstimulus.

Yet, little is\nknown about democratic participation in deliberative constitution-making\nprocesses. Here, we study a deliberative constituent process held by the\nChilean government between 2015 and 2016. The Chilean process had the highest\nlevel of citizen participation in the world ($204,402$ people, i.e., $1.3\\%$ of\nthe population) for such a process and covered $98\\%$ of the national\nterritory. In its participatory phase, people gathered in self-convoked groups\nof 10 to 30 members, and they collectively selected, deliberated, and wrote\ndown an argument on why the new constitution should include those social\nrights. To understand the citizen participation drivers in this volunteer\nprocess, we first identify the determinants at the municipality level. We find\nthe educational level, engagement in politics, support for the (left-wing)\ngovernment, and Internet access increased participation. In contrast,\npopulation density and the share of evangelical Christians decreased\nparticipation. Moreover, we do not find evidence of political manipulation on\ncitizen participation. In light of those determinants, we analyze the\ncollective selection of social rights, and the content produced during the\ndeliberative phase. The findings suggest that the knowledge embedded in cities,\nproxied using education levels and main economic activity, facilitates\ndeliberation about themes, concepts, and ideas. These results can inform the\norganization of new deliberative processes that involve voluntary citizen\nparticipation, from citizen consultations to constitution-making processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 May 2020 00:47:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-02"}

However, the existence of the Hercules-Corona Borealis Great\nWall (HCB) is purported to challenge this principle by some with an estimated\nsize exceeding 2000 Mpc. Recently, some have challenged the assertion of the\nexistence of the HCB, attributing the anisotropy to sky exposure effects. It\nhas never been explained why the original methods purporting the existence of\nthe HCB produce anisotropies, even if sky-exposure effects are taken into\naccount. In this paper, I apply the methods of the original papers purporting\nthe existence of the HCB in various Monte-Carlo simulations that assume\nisotropy to analyze the empirical meaning of the significance levels of the\noriginal tests used. I find that, although the statistical tests at first\nglance show significant anisotropies present in the suspect sample, Monte-Carlo\nsimulations can easily reproduce the sample in most cases, and if not, the\ndifferences can be accounted for by other statistical considerations. An\nupdated sample raises the probability of drawing the observed clustering from\nan isotropic sample ten-fold in some cases. Thus the statistical tests used in\nprior studies overestimate the significance of the observed anisotropy, and an\nupdated sample returns even less significant probabilities. Given the ability\nto reproduce the observed anisotropy in Monte-Carlo simulations, the new,\nhigher probabilities of being drawn from isotropy for an updated sample, and\nthe work of previous papers attributing anisotropies to sky-selection effects,\nthe existence of the HCB must be treated as doubtful at best.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 May 2020 01:21:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-02"}

In this paper, a novel real-time multi-constraints\nobstacle avoidance method using Light Detection and Ranging(LiDAR) is proposed,\nwhich is able to, based on the latest estimation of the robot pose and\nenvironment, find the sub-goal defined by a multi-constraints function within\nthe explored region and plan a corresponding optimal trajectory at each time\nstep iteratively, so that the robot approaches the goal over time. Meanwhile,\nat each time step, the improved Ant Colony Optimization(ACO) algorithm is also\nused to re-plan optimal paths from the latest robot pose to the latest defined\nsub-goal position.

It is of great research significance to help missing\npersons reunite with their families. In this work, the challenging problem is\nprogressively addressed in two respects. First, we propose a deep siamese\nnetwork to quantify the relative similarity between two individuals. When given\ntwo input face images, the deep siamese network extracts the features from them\nand fuses these features by combining and concatenating. Then, the fused\nfeatures are fed into a fully-connected network to obtain the similarity score\nbetween two faces, which is used to verify the kinship. To improve the\nperformance, a jury system is also employed for multi-model fusion. Second, two\ndeep siamese networks are integrated into a deep triplet network for\ntri-subject (i.e., father, mother and child) kinship verification, which is\nintended to decide whether a child is related to a pair of parents or not.\nSpecifically, the obtained similarity scores of father-child and mother-child\nare weighted to generate the parent-child similarity score for kinship\nverification.

Far from the core, we show that spiral rotations lead to an azimuthal\nbody force that is irrotational and of magnitude proportional to the\ntopological index of the spiral and its angular frequency. The force, although\nirrotational, cannot be included in the pressure field as it would lead to a\nnonphysical, multivalued pressure. We calculate the asymptotic dependence of\nthe resulting flow, and show that it leads to a logarithmic dependence of the\nazimuthal velocity on distance r away from the spiral core in the limit of\nnegligible damping coefficient.

Besides the traditional visual similarity term, the OR similarity\nalso contains an objectness term and a repulsion term. The objectness term can\nreduce the similarity of distractor images that not contain a person and boost\nthe performance of person search by improving the ranking of positive samples.\nBecause the probe person has a different person ID with its \\emph{neighbors},\nthe gallery images having a higher similarity with the \\emph{neighbors of\nprobe} should have a lower similarity with the probe person.

While in inference\nprocedure, we try another similarity computing method by dropping the followed\nseveral fully connected layers and directly computing the cosine similarity of\nthe two feature vectors. After similarity computation, we use the ranking\nalgorithm to merge the similarity scores with the same identity and output the\nordered list according to their similarities. To gain further improvement, we\ntry different combinations of backbones, training methods and similarity\ncomputing methods. Finally, we submit the best combination as our solution and\nour team(ustc-nelslip) obtains favorable result in the track3 of the RFIW2020\nchallenge with the first runner-up, which verifies the effectiveness of our\nmethod.

A systematic\ninvestigation of the development anti-patterns for IaC scripts can guide\npractitioners in identifying activities to avoid defects in IaC scripts.\nDevelopment anti-patterns are recurring development activities that relate with\ndefective IaC scripts.

In this regard, Deep\nNeural Networks (DNNs) provide an attractive modeling mechanism to approximate\nthe value function using sample transitions. DNN-based solutions, however,\nsuffer from high sensitivity to parameter selection, are prone to overfitting,\nand are not very sample efficient. A Kalman-based methodology, on the other\nhand, could be used as an efficient alternative. Such an approach, however,\ncommonly requires a-priori information about the system (such as noise\nstatistics) to perform efficiently. The main objective of this paper is to\naddress this issue. Methods: As a remedy to the aforementioned problems, this\npaper proposes an innovative Multiple Model Kalman Temporal Difference (MM-KTD)\nframework, which adapts the parameters of the filter using the observed states\nand rewards. Moreover, an active learning method is proposed to enhance the\nsampling efficiency of the system. More specifically, the estimated uncertainty\nof the value functions are exploited to form the behaviour policy leading to\nmore visits to less certain values, therefore, improving the overall learning\nsample efficiency. As a result, the proposed MM-KTD framework can learn the\noptimal policy with significantly reduced number of samples as compared to its\nDNN-based counterparts.

Existing\ndeep learning based methods for classifying bone age use the global image as\ninput, or exploit local information by annotating extra bounding boxes or key\npoints. However, training with the global image underutilizes discriminative\nlocal information, while providing extra annotations is expensive and\nsubjective. In this paper, we propose an attention-guided approach to\nautomatically localize the discriminative regions for BAA without any extra\nannotations. Specifically, we first train a classification model to learn the\nattention maps of the discriminative regions, finding the hand region, the most\ndiscriminative region (the carpal bones), and the next most discriminative\nregion (the metacarpal bones). Guided by those attention maps, we then crop the\ninformative local regions from the original image and aggregate different\nregions for BAA. Instead of taking BAA as a general regression task, which is\nsuboptimal due to the label ambiguity problem in the age label space, we\npropose using joint age distribution learning and expectation regression, which\nmakes use of the ordinal relationship among hand images with different\nindividual ages and leads to more robust age estimation.

By taking quantum Fisher information\n(QFI) as the metric of projective Hilbert spaces, estimating a small parameter\nshift is equivalent to distinguishing neighboring quantum states along a given\ncurve. Henceforth, information geometry plays a significant role in the single\nparameter estimation. However, the absence of high dimensional measures limits\nits applications in studying the multi-parameter systems. In this paper, we\nwill discuss the physical implications of the volume element of QFI.

The collective\ncoupling strength between a superconducting NbN lumped-element microresonator\nand Er implanted Si with an Er concentration of 1017 cm-3 at 20 mK was ~ 1 MHz.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 May 2020 09:12:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 Aug 2020 15:44:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-28"}

Data in multimedia applications such as\nimages and videos are commonly transformed into space of hundreds of\ndimensions. Such high-dimensional space has posed significant challenges for\nexisting kNN search algorithms with Bregman distances, which could only handle\ndata of medium dimensionality (typically less than 100). This paper addresses\nthe urgent problem of high-dimensional kNN search with Bregman distances. We\npropose a novel partition-filter-refinement framework. Specifically, we propose\nan optimized dimensionality partitioning scheme to solve several non-trivial\nissues. First, an effective bound from each partitioned subspace to obtain\nexact kNN results is derived. Second, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the\noptimized number of partitions and devise an effective strategy for\npartitioning. Third, we design an efficient integrated index structure for all\nthe subspaces together to accelerate the search processing. Moreover, we extend\nour exact solution to an approximate version by a trade-off between the\naccuracy and efficiency.

The star is\nmodelled by the Vaidya spacetime which is time dependent in nature. The\ncoupling of matter with curvature is the key feature of $f(R,T)$ theory and\nhere we have investigated its effects on a collapsing scenario. Two different\ntypes of models, one involving minimal and the other involving non-minimal\ncoupling between matter and curvature are considered for our study. Power law\nand exponential functionalities are considered as examples to check the outcome\nof the gravitational collapse. Our prime objective is to explore the nature of\nsingularities (black hole or naked singularity) that form as an end state of\nthe collapse. Existence of outgoing radial null geodesics from the central\nsingularity was probed and such existence implied the formation of naked\nsingularities thus defying the cosmic censorship hypothesis. The absence of\nsuch outgoing null geodesics would imply the formation of an event horizon and\nthe singularity formed becomes a black hole. Conditions under which such\npossibilities occur are derived for all the models and sub-models.\nGravitational strength of the singularity is also investigated and the\nconditions under which we can get a strong or a weak singularity is derived.\nThe results obtained are very interesting and may be attributed to the coupling\nbetween curvature and matter. It is seen that for non-minimal coupling there is\na possibility of a globally naked singularity, whereas for a minimal coupling\nscenario local nakedness is the only option. It is also found that the\nsingularity formed can be sufficiently weak in nature, which is cosmologically\ndesirable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 May 2020 09:41:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-02"}

Such a transition, under appropriate conditions on\nthe parameters, drives the two-spin system toward a maximally entangled state.\nIn this paper, effects on the quantum dynamics of the two qudits, stemming from\nthe Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) and dipole-dipole (d-d) interactions, are\ninvestigated qualitatively and quantitatively.

However, gravity-based measures often suffer from\nthree main limitations: (1) they are sensitive to the spatial configuration and\nscale of the units of analysis, which are not specifically designed for\ncapturing job accessibility patterns and are often too coarse; (2) they omit\nthe temporal dynamics of job opportunities and workers in the calculation,\ninstead assuming that they remain stable over time; and (3) they do not lend\nthemselves to dynamic geovisualization techniques. In this paper, a new\nmethodological framework for measuring and visualizing place-based job\naccessibility in space and time is presented that overcomes these three\nlimitations. First, discretization and dasymetric mapping approaches are used\nto disaggregate counts of jobs and workers over specific time intervals to a\nfine-scale grid. Second, Shen (1998) gravity-based accessibility measure is\nmodified to account for temporal fluctuations in the spatial distributions of\nthe supply of jobs and the demand of workers and is used to estimate hourly job\naccessibility at each cell. Third, a four-dimensional volumetric rendering\napproach is employed to integrate the hourly job access estimates into a\nspace-time cube environment, which enables the users to interactively visualize\nthe space-time job accessibility patterns. The integrated framework is\ndemonstrated in the context of a case study of the Tampa Bay region of Florida.\nThe findings demonstrate the value of the proposed methodology in job\naccessibility analysis and the policy-making process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 May 2020 13:39:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-02"}

This\nstudy provides a framework to examine how the disruption of transportation\nnetworks during and after a hurricane can impact a residents ability to access\nhealth services over time. Two different bridge closure conditions, inundation\nand structural failure, along with roadway inundation are used to quantify\npost-hurricane accessibility at short- and long-term temporal scales.\nInundation may close a bridge for hours or days, but a structural failure may\nclose a route for weeks or months.

We propose a\ngeneral strategy to obtain lower bounds on the variance of any estimator with\nbias smaller than a prespecified bound. This shows to which extent the\nbias-variance trade-off is unavoidable and allows to quantify the loss of\nperformance for methods that do not obey it. The approach is based on a number\nof abstract lower bounds for the variance involving the change of expectation\nwith respect to different probability measures as well as information measures\nsuch as the Kullback-Leibler or $\\chi^2$-divergence. In a second part of the\narticle, the abstract lower bounds are applied to several statistical models\nincluding the Gaussian white noise model, a boundary estimation problem, the\nGaussian sequence model and the high-dimensional linear regression model. For\nthese specific statistical applications, different types of bias-variance\ntrade-offs occur that vary considerably in their strength. For the trade-off\nbetween integrated squared bias and integrated variance in the Gaussian white\nnoise model, we propose to combine the general strategy for lower bounds with a\nreduction technique.

To achieve this we reviewed secondary data associated with\nchanges to retail demand, conducted interviews with 23 organisations associated\nwith supply to this market, and conducted four video workshops with 80\norganisations representing half of the UK fresh produce community. The results\nhighlight that, despite significant disruption, the retail dominated fresh food\nsupply chain has demonstrated a high degree of resilience.

We find that aplanatic zone-plate\ndesigns, whereby aberrations are corrected over a large field of view, can be\nachieved by axi-symmetric lenses but not the crossed lenses. We investigate the\nperformance of 1 nm-resolution lenses with focal lengths of about 1 mm and show\ntheir fields of view are mainly limited by the acceptance angle of Bragg\ndiffraction, and that aberrations can limit the performance of lenses with\nlonger focal lengths. We apply the ray-tracing formalism for a tolerancing\nanalysis of imperfect lenses and examine some strategies for the correction of\ntheir aberrations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 May 2020 15:34:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-02"}

We calculate the\nvalue of constants $a$, $b$, $B$ and $C$ using matching conditions and the\nobserved values of the masses and radii of known samples. To describe the\nstrange quark matter (SQM) distribution, here we have used the phenomenological\nMIT bag model equation of state (EOS) where the density profile ($\\rho$) is\nrelated to the radial pressure ($p_r$) as $p_r(r)=\\frac{1}{3}(\\rho-4B_g)$. Here\nquark pressure is responsible for generation of bag constant $B_g$. Motivation\nbehind this study lies in finding out a non-singular physically acceptable\nsolution having various properties of strange stars. The model shows\nconsistency with various energy conditions, TOV equation, Herrera's cracking\ncondition and also with Harrison-Zel$'$dovich-Novikov's static stability\ncriteria. Numerical values of EOS parameter and the adiabatic index also\nenhance the acceptability of our model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 May 2020 08:39:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-03"}

The\nresults are compared to those obtained by three methodologies: ($i$) the\nclassical method of Heidemann and Khalil (1980), which uses a double-loop\nstructure, also in terms of temperature and molar volume; ($ii$) the algorithm\nof Dimitrakopoulos, Jia, and Li (2014), which employs a damped Newton algorithm\nand ($iii$) the methodology proposed by Nichita and Gomez (2010), based on a\nstochastic algorithm. The proposed methodology proves to be robust and accurate\nin the prediction of critical points, as well as provides a global view of the\nnonlinear problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 May 2020 14:49:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-18"}

Deep\nlearning approaches have achieved excellent outcomes when utilized to speed up\nstress computation and learn the physics without prior knowledge of underlying\nequations. However, most studies restrict the variation of geometry or boundary\nconditions, making these methods difficult to be generalized to unseen\nconfigurations. We propose a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN)\nmodel for predicting 2D von Mises stress distributions in solid structures. The\ncGAN learns to generate stress distributions conditioned by geometries, load,\nand boundary conditions through a two-player minimax game between two neural\nnetworks with no prior knowledge. By evaluating the generative network on two\nstress distribution datasets under multiple metrics, we demonstrate that our\nmodel can predict more accurate high-resolution stress distributions than a\nbaseline convolutional neural network model, given various and complex cases of\ngeometry, load and boundary conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 May 2020 00:28:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-24"}

Our research advances\nthis line of work by developing a simulation-based statistic test for the local\nindicator of colocation quotient (LCLQ). The study applies the indicator to\nexamine the association of land use facilities with crime patterns. Moreover,\nwe use the street network distance in addition to the traditional Euclidean\ndistance in defining neighbors since human activities (including facilities and\ncrimes) usually occur along a street network. The method is applied to analyze\nthe colocation of three types of crimes and three categories of facilities in a\ncity in Jiangsu Province, China.

Naturally, different possibilities\n(including herbal medicines having known therapeutic significance) have been\nexplored by the scientists. The systematic scientific study (beginning with in\nsilico study) of herbal medicines in particular and any drug in general is now\npossible as the structural components (proteins) of COVID-19 are already\ncharacterized. The main protease of COVID-19 virus is $\\rm{M^{pro}}$ or\n$\\rm{3CL^{pro}}$ which is a key CoV enzyme and an attractive drug target as it\nplays a pivotal role in mediating viral replication and transcription. In the\npresent study, $\\rm{3CL^{pro}}$ is used to study drug:3CLpro interactions and\nthus to investigate whether all or any of the main chemical constituents of\nTinospora cordifolia (e.g., berberine $\\rm{(C_{20}H_{18}NO_{4})}$,\n$\\beta$-sitosterol $\\rm{(C_{29}H_{50}O)}$, choline $\\rm{(C_{5}H_{14}NO)}$,\ntetrahydropalmatine $\\rm{(C_{21}H_{25}NO_{4})}$ and octacosanol\n$\\rm{(C_{28}H_{58}O))}$ can be used as an anti-viral drug against SARS-CoV-2.\nThe in silico study performed using tools of network pharmacology, molecular\ndocking including molecular dynamics have revealed that among all considered\nphytochemicals in Tinospora cordifolia, berberine can regulate $\\rm{3CL^{pro}}$\nprotein's function due to its easy inhibition and thus can control viral\nreplication. The selection of Tinospora cordifolia was motivated by the fact\nthat the main constituents of it are known to be responsible for various\nantiviral activities and the treatment of jaundice, rheumatism, diabetes, etc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 29 May 2020 20:10:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 Aug 2020 17:00:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-07"}

Here\nwe outline a new paradigm for deriving energy functions of hyperdimensional\nmolecular systems, which involves generating data for low-dimensional systems\nin virtual reality (VR) to then efficiently train atomic neural networks\n(ANNs). This generates high quality data for specific areas of interest within\nthe hyperdimensional space that characterizes a molecule's potential energy\nsurface (PES). We demonstrate the utility of this approach by gathering data\nwithin VR to train ANNs on chemical reactions involving fewer than 8 heavy\natoms. This strategy enables us to predict the energies of much\nhigher-dimensional systems, e.g. containing nearly 100 atoms. Training on\ndatasets containing only 15K geometries, this approach generates mean absolute\nerrors around 2 kcal/mol. This represents one of the first times that an\nANN-PES for a large reactive radical has been generated using such a small\ndataset. Our results suggest VR enables the intelligent curation of\nhigh-quality data, which accelerates the learning process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 30 May 2020 13:56:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-28"}
