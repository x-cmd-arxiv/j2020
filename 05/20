Results from particle-resolved direct numerical simulations (PR-DNS) of\nflow over a random array of stationary particles for eight combinations of\nparticle Reynolds number ($Re$) and volume fraction ($\\phi$) are used in the\ndevelopment of the models. The first approach follows a two step process. In\nthe first flow prediction step, the perturbation flow due to a particle is\nobtained as an axisymmetric superposable wake using linear regression. In the\nsecond force prediction step, the force on a particle is evaluated in terms of\nthe perturbation flow induced by all its neighbors using the generalized\nFax\\'en form of the force expression. In the second approach, the force data on\nall the particles from the PR-DNS simulations is used to develop an artificial\nneural network (ANN) model for direct prediction of force on a particle. Due to\nthe unavoidable limitation on the number of fully resolved particles in the\nPR-DNS simulations, direct force prediction with the ANN model tends to\nover-fit the data and performs poorly in the prediction of test data. In\ncontrast, due to the millions of grid points used in the PR-DNS simulations,\naccurate flow prediction is possible, which then allows accurate prediction of\nparticle force. This hybridization of multiphase physics and machine learning\nis particularly important, since it blends the strength of each, and the\nresulting pairwise interaction extended point-particle (PIEP) model cannot be\ndeveloped by either physics or machine learning alone.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 May 2020 16:29:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}

Such protein patterns form via an interplay\nof protein reactions and protein transport. Since Turing's seminal work, the\nformation of protein patterns resulting from the interplay between reactions\nand diffusive transport has been widely studied. Over the last few years,\nincreasing evidence shows that also advective transport, resulting from\ncytosolic and cortical flows, is present in many cells. However, it remains\nunclear how and whether these flows contribute to protein-pattern formation. To\naddress this question, we use a minimal model that conserves the total protein\nmass to characterize the effects of cytosolic flow on pattern formation.\nCombining a linear stability analysis with numerical simulations, we find that\nmembrane-bound protein patterns propagate against the direction of cytoplasmic\nflow with a speed that is maximal for intermediate flow speed. We show that the\nmechanism underlying this pattern propagation relies on a higher protein influx\non the upstream side of the pattern compared to the downstream side.\nFurthermore, we find that cytosolic flow can change the membrane pattern\nqualitatively from a peak pattern to a mesa pattern. Finally, our study shows\nthat a non-uniform flow profile can induce pattern formation by triggering a\nregional lateral instability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 May 2020 16:32:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-20"}

Sound source separation is thus often required as a\npreprocessing step prior to speech recognition to improve the signal to\ndistortion ratio (SDR). Recently, a combination of beamforming and speech\nseparation networks have been proposed to improve the target source quality in\nthe direction of arrival of interest. However, with this type of approach, the\nneural network needs to be trained in advance for a specific microphone array\ngeometry, which limits versatility when adding/removing microphones, or\nchanging the shape of the array. The solution presented in this paper is to\ntrain a neural network on pairs of microphones with different spacing and\nacoustic environmental conditions, and then use this network to estimate a\ntime-frequency mask from all the pairs of microphones forming the array with an\narbitrary shape. Using this mask, the target and noise covariance matrices can\nbe estimated, and then used to perform generalized eigenvalue (GEV)\nbeamforming.

The main components of our new algorithm are\na new faster technique for constructing blocker set deterministically and a new\npipelined method for deterministically propagating distance values from source\nnodes to the blocker set nodes in the network. Both of these techniques have\npotential applications to other distributed algorithms.\n  Our new deterministic algorithm for computing blocker set adapts the NC\napproximate hypergraph set cover algorithm in [BRS94] to the distributed\nconstruction of a blocker set. It follows the two-step process of first\ndesigning a randomized algorithm that uses only pairwise independence, and then\nderandomizes this algorithm using a sample space of linear size. This algorithm\nruns in almost the same number of rounds as the initial step in our APSP\nalgorithm that computes $h$-hops shortest paths, and significantly improves on\nthe deterministic blocker set algorithms in [ARKP18, AR19] by removing an\nadditional $n\\cdot |Q|$ term in the round bound, where Q is the blocker set.\n  The other new component in our APSP algorithm is a deterministic pipelined\napproach to propagate distance values from source nodes to blocker nodes. We\nuse a simple natural round-robin method for this step, and we show using a\nsuitable progress measure that it achieve the $\\tilde{O}(n^{4/3})$ bound on the\nnumber of rounds.

We utilise simple simulations\nof a population of individual cells in space to examine how changes in\nmechanical properties of invasive cells and their surroundings can affect the\nspeed of cell migration. We also find that the growth rate of large lesions\ndepends weakly on the migration speed of escaping cells, and has stronger and\nmore complex dependencies on the rates of other stochastic processes in the\nmodel, namely the rate at which cells transition to being motile and the\nreverse rate at which cells cease to be motile.\n  To examine how the rates of growth and evolution of an ensemble of cancerous\nlesions depends on their geometry and underlying fitness landscape, we develop\nan analytical framework in which the spatial structure is coarse grained and\nthe cancer treated as a continuously growing system with stochastic migration\nevents. Both approaches conclude that the whole ensemble can undergo\nmigration-driven exponential growth regardless of the dependence of size on\ntime of individual lesions, and that the relationship between growth rate and\nrate of migration is determined by the geometrical constraints of individual\nlesions. We also find that linear fitness landscapes result in\nfaster-than-exponential growth of the ensemble, and we can determine the\nexpected number of driver mutations present in several important cases of the\nmodel.\n  Finally, we study data from a clinical study of the effectiveness of a new\nlow-dose combined chemotherapy. This enables us to test some important\nhypotheses about the growth rate of pancreatic cancers and the speed with which\nevolution occurs in reality.

The first is the nature of beta\nequilibrium in the portion of a merger that is transparent to neutrinos. We\ncalculate the weak interaction (Urca) rates and find that the beta equilibrium\ncondition needs to be modified by adding an additional chemical potential,\nwhich changes slightly the particle content in neutrino-transparent beta\nequilibrium. Secondly, we calculate the bulk viscosity in neutrino-transparent\nnuclear matter in conditions encountered in neutron star mergers. Bulk\nviscosity arises from a phase lag between the pressure and density in the\nnuclear matter, which is due to the finite rate of beta equilibration. When\nbulk viscosity is sufficiently strong, which happens when the equilibration\nrate nearly matches the frequency of the density oscillation, it can noticeably\ndampen the oscillation. We find that in certain thermodynamic conditions likely\nencountered in mergers, oscillations in nuclear matter can be damped on\ntimescales on the order of 10 milliseconds, so we conclude that bulk viscosity\nshould be included in merger simulations. Finally, we study thermal transport\ndue to axions in neutron star mergers. We conclude that axions are never\ntrapped in mergers, but instead escape, carrying energy away from the merger.\nWe calculate the cooling time due to the energy carried away by axions and find\nthat within current constraints on the axion-nucleon coupling, axions could\ncool fluid elements in mergers on timescales which could affect the dynamics of\nthe merger.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 May 2020 17:46:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-24"}

We show that after correcting for\nthe identified statistical bias, only an estimated $3.6\\% \\pm 1.5\\%$ of the\noriginal $11.7\\% \\pm 1.0\\%$ accuracy drop remains unaccounted for. We conclude\nwith concrete recommendations for recognizing and avoiding bias in dataset\nreplication.

We present an equation\nlearning methodology comprised of data denoising, equation learning, model\nselection and post-processing steps that infers a dynamical systems model from\nnoisy spatiotemporal data.

The PyRoss\nlibrary supports arbitrary structured models formulated stochastically (as\nmaster equations) or deterministically (as ODEs) and allows mid-run\ntransitioning from one to the other. By supporting additional compartmental\nsubdivision ad libitum, PyRoss can emulate time-since-infection models and\nallows medical stages such as hospitalization or quarantine to be modelled and\nforecast. The PyRoss library enables fitting to epidemiological data, as\navailable, using Bayesian parameter inference, so that competing models can be\nweighed by their evidence. PyRoss allows fully Bayesian forecasts of the impact\nof idealized NPIs by convolving uncertainties arising from epidemiological\ndata, model choice, parameters, and intrinsic stochasticity.

The models\nare described as limited-stretch, or restricted elastic, because the strain\nenergy and stress response become infinite at a finite value of the first\ninvariant. These models describe well the limited stretch of the polymer chains\nof which rubber is composed. We discuss Gent's model which is the simplest\nlimited-stretch model and agrees well with experiment. Various statistical\nmodels are then described: the one-chain, three-chain, four-chain and\nArruda-Boyce eight-chain models, all of which involve the inverse Langevin\nfunction. A numerical comparison between the three-chain and eight-chain models\nis provided. Next, we compare various models which involve approximations to\nthe inverse Langevin function with the exact inverse Langevin function of the\neight-chain model. A new approximate model is proposed that is as simple as\nCohen's original model but significantly more accurate. We show that\neffectively the eight-chain model may be regarded as a linear combination of\nthe neo-Hookean and Gent models. Treloar's model is shown to have about half\nthe percentage error of our new model but it is much more complicated. For\ncompleteness a modified Treloar model is introduced but this is only slightly\nmore accurate than Treloar's original model. For the deformations of uniaxial\ntension, biaxial tension, pure shear and simple shear we compare the accuracy\nof these models, and that of Puso, with the eight-chain model by means of\ngraphs and a table. Our approximations compare extremely well with models\nfrequently used and described in the literature, having the smallest mean\npercentage error over most of the range of the argument.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 May 2020 19:18:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-21"}

In general, though, we find\nthat the NIR amplitudes are lower than their optical counterparts. We conclude\nthat starspot modulation for rapidly-rotating M stars frequently remains\ncoherent for hundreds of stellar rotations, and gives rise to Doppler signals\nthat, due to this coherence, may be mistaken for exoplanets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 May 2020 18:00:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-22"}

These results are consistent with the prediction for standard SN Ia\nmodels, where the heavier elements are synthesized in the interior of an\nexploding white dwarf. We find, however, that the peak location of the Fe K\nemission is slightly offset to the west with respect to the geometric center of\nthe SNR. This apparent asymmetry is likely due to the inhomogeneous density\ndistribution of the ambient medium, consistent with our radio observations of\nthe ambient molecular and neutral gas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 May 2020 18:00:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 May 2020 08:22:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 6 Jul 2020 12:32:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-07"}

This approach is often referred to as neural collaborative filtering\n(NCF). In this work, we revisit the experiments of the NCF paper that\npopularized learned similarities using MLPs. First, we show that with a proper\nhyperparameter selection, a simple dot product substantially outperforms the\nproposed learned similarities. Second, while a MLP can in theory approximate\nany function, we show that it is non-trivial to learn a dot product with an\nMLP. Finally, we discuss practical issues that arise when applying MLP based\nsimilarities and show that MLPs are too costly to use for item recommendation\nin production environments while dot products allow to apply very efficient\nretrieval algorithms.

Unfortunately, their commercialization is still\nhindered by an intrinsic instability towards classical environmental\nconditions. Water in particular promotes fast decomposition, leading to a\ndrastic decrease in device performance. An innovative functional approach to\novercome this major issue could derive from integrating water-splitting active\nspecies within charge extracting layers adjacent to the perovskite photoactive\nlayer, converting incoming water molecules into molecular oxygen and hydrogen\nbefore they reach this last one, thus preserving device performance in time. In\nthis work we report for the first time on a perovskite-ancillary layer based on\nCuSCN nanoplateletes dispersed in a p-type semiconducting polymeric matrix,\ncombining hole extraction/transport properties with good water-oxidation\nactivity, that transforms incoming water molecules and further triggers the in\nsitu p-doping of the conjugated polymer by means of the produced dioxygen,\nfurther improving transport of photogenerated charges.

These methods are more effective than classic approaches,\nhowever, due to memory limitations they can only handle low-resolution inputs,\ntypically smaller than 1K. Meanwhile, the resolution of photos captured with\nmobile devices increases up to 8K. Naive up-sampling of the low-resolution\ninpainted result can merely yield a large yet blurry result. Whereas, adding a\nhigh-frequency residual image onto the large blurry image can generate a sharp\nresult, rich in details and textures. Motivated by this, we propose a\nContextual Residual Aggregation (CRA) mechanism that can produce high-frequency\nresiduals for missing contents by weighted aggregating residuals from\ncontextual patches, thus only requiring a low-resolution prediction from the\nnetwork. Since convolutional layers of the neural network only need to operate\non low-resolution inputs and outputs, the cost of memory and computing power is\nthus well suppressed.

The magnetic reluctance of the medium around the permanent\nmagnet is modulated to change the magnetic flux path. The nonlinear properties\nof magnetic material as a critical phenomenon are used for effective\nmodulation. As a result, a time-variant field is generated by the modulation of\nthe permanent magnet flux. This non-resonant time-variant characterization\nmeans that the transmitter is not bound to the fundamental limits of the\nantennas and can transmit higher data rates. A prototype transmitter as a\nprove-of-concept is designed and tested based on the proposed idea.

This makes ensuring their availability and\nrecoverability in case of a compromise a paramount goal. The large and rapidly\ngrowing number of deployed IoT devices make manual recovery impractical,\nespecially if the devices are dispersed over a large area. Thus, there is a\nneed for a reliable and scalable remote recovery mechanism that works even\nafter attackers have taken full control over devices, possibly misusing them or\ntrying to render them useless.\n  To tackle this problem, we present Lazarus, a system that enables the remote\nrecovery of compromised IoT devices. With Lazarus, an IoT administrator can\nremotely control the code running on IoT devices unconditionally and within a\nguaranteed time bound. This makes recovery possible even in case of severe\ncorruption of the devices' software stack.

The temporal isolation prevents secrets from being\nleaked through side-channels to untrusted software. Inside the trusted\nexecution environment, we place minimal functionality that constrains untrusted\nsoftware at runtime.\n  We implement Lazarus on an ARM Cortex-M33-based microcontroller in a full\nsetup with an IoT hub, device provisioning and secure update functionality.

In previous work we introduced an alternative picture for the\ncosmological power spectra based on the nonperturbative features of the quantum\nversion of Einstein's gravity, instead of currently popular inflation models\nbased on scalar fields. The key ingredients in this new picture are the\nappearance of a nontrivial gravitational vacuum condensate (directly related to\nthe observed cosmological constant), and a calculable renormalization group\nrunning of Newton's G on cosmological scales. Results obtained previously were\nlargely based on a semi-analytical treatment, and often suffered from the\nlimitations of various approximations and simplifying assumptions. In this\nwork, we extend and refine our previous calculations by laying out an updated\nand extended analysis, which now utilizes a set of suitably modified\nstate-of-the-art numerical programs (ISiTGR, MGCAMB and MGCLASS) developed for\nobservational cosmology. As a result, we are able to remove some of the\napproximations employed in our previous studies, leading to a number of novel\nand detailed physical predictions. These should help in potentially distinguish\nthe vacuum condensate picture of quantum gravity from that of other models such\nas scalar field inflation. Here, besides the matter power spectrum P(k), we\nwork out in detail predictions for what are referred to as the TT, TE, EE, BB\nangular spectra, as well as their closely related lensing spectra.

Methods: SPARCQ uses phase-cycling to obtain\nbSSFP frequency profiles, which display asymmetries in the presence of fat and\nwater at certain repetition times. For each voxel, the measured signal profile\nis decomposed into a weighted sum of simulated profiles via multi-compartment\ndictionary matching.

SAR uses a high-power antenna to illuminate target\nlocations with electromagnetic radiation, e.g., 10GHz radio waves, and\nilluminated surface backscatter is sensed by the antenna which is then used to\ngenerate images of structures. Real SAR data is difficult and costly to produce\nand, for research, lacks a reliable source ground truth. This article proposes\na open source SAR simulator to compute phase histories for arbitrary 3D scenes\nusing newly available ray-tracing hardware made available commercially through\nthe NVIDIA's RTX graphics cards series. The OptiX GPU ray tracing library for\nNVIDIA GPUs is used to calculate SAR phase histories at unprecedented\ncomputational speeds.

These classes differ in their arrival\nrates, size distributions, and job parallelizability. With respect to\nparalellizability, some jobs are elastic, meaning they can parallelize linearly\nacross many servers. Other jobs are inelastic, meaning they can only run on a\nsingle server. Although job classes can differ drastically, they are typically\nforced to share a single cluster. When sharing a cluster among heterogeneous\njobs, one must decide how to allocate servers to each job at every moment in\ntime. In this paper, we design and analyze allocation policies which aim to\nminimize the mean response time across jobs, where a job's response time is the\ntime from when it arrives until it completes.\n  We model this problem in a stochastic setting where each job may be elastic\nor inelastic. Job sizes are drawn from exponential distributions, but are\nunknown to the system. We show that, in the common case where elastic jobs are\nlarger on average than inelastic jobs, the optimal allocation policy is\nInelastic-First, giving inelastic jobs preemptive priority over elastic jobs.\nWe obtain this result by introducing a novel sample path argument. We also show\nthat there exist cases where Elastic-First (giving priority to elastic jobs)\nperforms better than Inelastic-First. We then provide the first analysis of\nmean response time under both Elastic-First and Inelastic-First by leveraging\nrecent techniques for solving high-dimensional Markov chains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 May 2020 20:35:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-21"}

Unfortunately, continually\nadapting the conventional virtual memory framework to each possible system\nconfiguration is challenging, and often results in performance loss or requires\nnon-trivial workarounds. To address these challenges, we propose a new virtual\nmemory framework, the Virtual Block Interface (VBI). We design VBI based on the\nkey idea that delegating memory management duties to hardware can reduce the\noverheads and software complexity associated with virtual memory. VBI\nintroduces a set of variable-sized virtual blocks (VBs) to applications. Each\nVB is a contiguous region of the globally-visible VBI address space, and an\napplication can allocate each semantically meaningful unit of information\n(e.g., a data structure) in a separate VB. VBI decouples access protection from\nmemory allocation and address translation. While the OS controls which programs\nhave access to which VBs, dedicated hardware in the memory controller manages\nthe physical memory allocation and address translation of the VBs. This\napproach enables several architectural optimizations to (1) efficiently and\nflexibly cater to different and increasingly diverse system configurations, and\n(2) eliminate key inefficiencies of conventional virtual memory. We demonstrate\nthe benefits of VBI with two important use cases: (1) reducing the overheads of\naddress translation (for both native execution and virtual machine\nenvironments), as VBI reduces the number of translation requests and associated\nmemory accesses; and (2) two heterogeneous main memory architectures, where VBI\nincreases the effectiveness of managing fast memory regions. For both cases,\nVBI significanttly improves performance over conventional virtual memory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 May 2020 20:40:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-21"}

To break the current impasse, it\nis necessary to develop as many independent techniques as possible, such as the\nuse of Type II supernovae (SNe II). The goal of this paper is to demonstrate\nthe utility of SNe II for deriving accurate extragalactic distances, which will\nbe an asset for the next generation of telescopes where more-distant SNe II\nwill be discovered. More specifically, we present a sample from the Dark Energy\nSurvey Supernova Program (DES-SN) consisting of 15 SNe II with photometric and\nspectroscopic information spanning a redshift range up to 0.35. Combining our\nDES SNe with publicly available samples, and using the standard candle method\n(SCM), we construct the largest available Hubble diagram with SNe II in the\nHubble flow (70 SNe II) and find an observed dispersion of 0.27 mag. We\ndemonstrate that adding a colour term to the SN II standardisation does not\nreduce the scatter in the Hubble diagram. Although SNe II are viable as\ndistance indicators, this work points out important issues for improving their\nutility as independent extragalactic beacons: find new correlations, define a\nmore standard subclass of SNe II, construct new SN II templates, and dedicate\nmore observing time to high-redshift SNe II. Finally, for the first time, we\nperform simulations to estimate the redshift-dependent distance-modulus bias\ndue to selection effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 May 2020 21:14:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-27"}

The growing demand for quality of service\n(QoS) characterized by performance metrics, such as spectrum efficiency, peak\ndata rate, and outage probability, is mainly limited by inaccurate\nprediction/estimation of channel state information (CSI) of the rapidly\nchanging environment around moving vehicles. One way to increase the prediction\nhorizon of CSI in order to improve the QoS is deploying predictor antennas\n(PAs). A PA system consists of two sets of antennas typically mounted on the\nroof of a vehicle, where the PAs positioned at the front of the vehicle are\nused to predict the CSI observed by the receive antennas (RAs) that are aligned\nbehind the PAs. In realistic PA systems, however, the actual benefit is\naffected by a variety of factors, including spatial mismatch, antenna\nutilization, temporal correlation of scattering environment, and CSI estimation\nerror.

The large-scale variations of the solar wind proton\ndensity and temperature which are associated with the plasma expansion through\nthe heliosphere, follow a polytropic model with a polytropic index ~5/3. On the\nother hand, the short time-scale fluctuations which may be associated with\nturbulence, follow a model with a larger polytropic index. We investigate\npossible correlations between the polytropic index of short time-scale\nfluctuations and the plasma speed, plasma beta, and the magnetic field\ndirection.

Treatment preferences of clusters (e.g., physician\npractices) are the most f6requently used instruments in instrumental variable\nanalyses (IVA). These preference-based IVAs are usually conducted on data\nclustered by region, hospital/facility, or physician, where unmeasured\nconfounding often occurs within or between clusters. We aim to quantify the\nimpact of unmeasured confounding on the bias of effect estimators in IVA, as\nwell as alternative methods including ordinary least squares regression, linear\nmixed models (LMM) and fixed effect models (FE) to study the effect of a\ncontinuous exposure (e.g., treatment dose).

We show that IVAs can provide consistent estimates\nwhen unmeasured within-cluster confounding exists, but not when between-cluster\nconfounding exists. On the other hand, FEs and LMMs can provide consistent\nestimates when unmeasured between-cluster confounding exits, but not for\nwithin-cluster confounding. Whether IVAs are advantageous in reducing bias over\nFEs and LMMs depends on the extent of unmeasured within-cluster confounding\nrelative to between-cluster confounding.

Among the phase transitions observed are\nsuperconducting, magnetic, and several types of structural transitions,\nincluding a tetragonal-to-orthorhombic and a collapsed-tetragonal transition.\nIn particular, the widely-observed tetragonal-to-orthorhombic transition is\nbelieved to be a result of an electronic order that is coupled to the\ncrystalline lattice and is, thus, referred to as nematic transition. Nematicity\nis therefore a prominent feature of these materials, which signals the\nimportance of the coupling of electronic and lattice properties.\nCorrespondingly, these systems are particularly susceptible to tuning via\npressure (hydrostatic, uniaxial, or some combination). We review efforts to\nprobe the phase diagrams of pressure-tuned iron-based superconductors, with a\nstrong focus on our own recent insights into the phase diagrams of several\nmembers of this material class under hydrostatic pressure. These studies on\nFeSe, Ba(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_2$As$_2$, Ca(Fe$_{1-x}$Co$_x$)$_2$As$_2$ and\nCaK(Fe$_{1-x}$Ni$_x$)$_4$As$_4$ were, to a significant extent, made possible by\nadvances of what measurements can be adapted to the use under differing\npressure environments. We point out the potential impact of these tools for the\nstudy of the wider class of strongly correlated electron systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 May 2020 23:44:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-28"}

This paper develops a principled\ngeometric approach to model and understand such influences by incorporating\nreplicator dynamics into a broader control-theoretic framework. Central to our\napproach is the construction of a Lie algebra structure on the space of fitness\nmaps, mapping homomorphically to the Lie algebra of replicator vector fields.\nThis is akin to classical mechanics, where the Poisson bracket Lie algebra of\nfunctions maps to associated Hamiltonian vector fields. We show, extending the\nwork of Svirezhev in 1972, that a trajectory of a replicator vector field is\nthe base integral curve of a solution to a Hamiltonian system defined on the\ncotangent bundle of the simplex. Further, we exploit the Lie algebraic\nstructure of fitness maps to determine controllability properties of a class of\nreplicator systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 May 2020 23:49:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-21"}

We show how to use the filtered spread as\nthe trading indicator to carry out statistical arbitrage. We also propose a new\ntrading strategy and present a Monte Carlo based approach to select the optimal\ntrading rule. As the first empirical application, we apply the new model and\nthe new trading strategy to two examples: PEP vs KO and EWT vs EWH. The results\nshow that the new approach can achieve a 21.86% annualized return for the\nPEP/KO pair and a 31.84% annualized return for the EWT/EWH pair.

Pioneer approaches\ndetect the region of interests (i.e., RoIs) from images and use the RoI\nembeddings as image representations. In general, RoIs tend to represent the\n\"object-level\" information in the fashion images, while fashion texts are prone\nto describe more detailed information, e.g. styles, attributes.

Given its essential role in proteolytic processing, the main protease\nMpro has been identified as an attractive candidate for drugs against\nSARS-CoV-2 and similar coronaviruses. Recent high-throughput screening studies\nhave identified a set of existing, small-molecule drugs as potent Mpro\ninhibitors.

A detailed analysis of\nthe free energy of binding indicates that the affinity of Ebselen to this\nsecond binding site is in fact significantly larger than that to the catalytic\nsite. A strain analysis indicates that Ebselen bound between the II-III domains\nexerts a pronounced allosteric effect that regulates catalytic site access\nthrough surface loop interactions, and induces a displacement and\nreconfiguration of water hotspots, including the catalytic water, which could\ninterfere with normal enzymatic function.

The performance evaluation of\nthese two new models for learning continuous time series with irregular\nsampling rate is then demonstrated. Experiments show that these new ODE based\nRNN models require less training time than Latent ODEs and conventional Neural\nODEs. They can achieve higher accuracy quickly, and the design of the neural\nnetwork is simpler than, previous neural ODE systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 May 2020 01:02:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-21"}

The method is based on the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) and\nuses a Bernoulli distribution between PC images.

However, there remains\na considerable gap between such theoretically analyzed algorithms and the ones\nused in practice. Inspired by this, we propose an efficient RL algorithm,\ncalled {\\em mirror descent policy optimization} (MDPO). MDPO iteratively\nupdates the policy by {\\em approximately} solving a trust-region problem, whose\nobjective function consists of two terms: a linearization of the standard RL\nobjective and a proximity term that restricts two consecutive policies to be\nclose to each other. Each update performs this approximation by taking multiple\ngradient steps on this objective function. We derive {\\em on-policy} and {\\em\noff-policy} variants of MDPO, while emphasizing important design choices\nmotivated by the existing theory of MD in RL. We highlight the connections\nbetween on-policy MDPO and two popular trust-region RL algorithms: TRPO and\nPPO, and show that explicitly enforcing the trust-region constraint is in fact\n{\\em not} a necessity for high performance gains in TRPO. We then show how the\npopular soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm can be derived by slight\nmodifications of off-policy MDPO. Overall, MDPO is derived from the MD\nprinciples, offers a unified approach to viewing a number of popular RL\nalgorithms, and performs better than or on-par with TRPO, PPO, and SAC in a\nnumber of continuous control tasks.

To address\nsuch a difficult problem, this paper presents a novel attention-based neural\nnetwork to generate high-quality enhanced low-light images from the raw sensor\ndata. Specifically, we first employ attention strategy (i.e. channel attention\nand spatial attention modules) to suppress undesired chromatic aberration and\nnoise. The channel attention module guides the network to refine redundant\ncolour features. The spatial attention module focuses on denoising by taking\nadvantage of the non-local correlation in the image.

In\nthe blind signal processing area, an approach for jointly optimizing\ndereverberation and source separation (DR+SS) has been proposed, however, this\napproach requires huge computing cost, and has not been extended for\napplication to DN+DR+SS. To overcome the above limitations, this paper develops\nnew approaches for jointly optimizing DN+DR+SS in a computationally much more\nefficient way. To this end, we first present an objective function to optimize\na CBF for performing DN+DR+SS based on the maximum likelihood estimation, on an\nassumption that the steering vectors of the target signals are given or can be\nestimated, e.g., using a neural network. This paper refers to a CBF optimized\nby this objective function as a weighted Minimum-Power Distortionless Response\n(wMPDR) CBF. Then, we derive two algorithms for optimizing a wMPDR CBF based on\ntwo different ways of factorizing a CBF into WPE filters and beamformers.\nExperiments using noisy reverberant sound mixtures show that the proposed\noptimization approaches greatly improve the performance of the speech\nenhancement in comparison with the conventional cascade configuration in terms\nof the signal distortion measures and ASR performance. It is also shown that\nthe proposed approaches can greatly reduce the computing cost with improved\nestimation accuracy in comparison with the conventional joint optimization\napproach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 May 2020 04:38:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 14 Jun 2020 00:35:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 2 Aug 2020 22:55:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-04"}

Conventionally, the wake-up function\nis realized using a radio-frequency oscillator with an amplifier to recognize\nan activating radio signal. Therefore, even during standby operation, the\nsensor node utilizes a certain amount of energy, which can be critical for an\nenergy-harvesting source. In this study, we propose a novel approach of an\noptical wake-up for autonomous sensor nodes, which employs a solar cell as a\nwake-up signal detector. The bright light flash coming from another node or a\nsmartphone exposes a solar cell, which activates the sensor node. Unlike\nphotodiodes or RF-antennas, solar cells do not require any additional energy to\ndetect the light signal. Therefore, the proposed electric circuit allows the\nsensor node to wake-up from a complete power-off state. The solar cell of the\nnovel wake-up receiver has a sensitive area of 8 mm x 10 mm. The wake-up signal\ncan be recognized from a maximal distance of 25 cm at ambient illumination from\n0 to 1600 lx with a transmitter optical power of 20 mW. At power-off state the\npower consumptions are the lowest among all existing off-the-shelf wake-up\nreceivers: 248 pW at 0 lx and 627 nW at 1600 lx.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 May 2020 08:49:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-21"}

In this paper, we introduce deep learning to analyze\npatterns in the beam projection image to facilitate three-dimensional\nreconstruction of particle tracks. We propose an end-to-end neural network\nbased on segmentation and fitting for feature extraction and regression. Two\nsegmentation branches, named binary segmentation and semantic segmentation,\nperform initial track determination and pixel-track association. Then pixels\nare assigned to multiple tracks, and a weighted least squares fitting is\nimplemented with full back-propagation. Besides, we introduce a center-angle\nmeasure to judge the precision of location and orientation by combining two\nseparate factors. The initial position resolution achieves 8.8 $\\mu m$ for the\nsingle track and 11.4 $\\mu m$ (15.2 $\\mu m$) for the 1-3 tracks (1-5 tracks),\nand the angle resolution achieves 0.15$^{\\circ}$ and 0.21$^{\\circ}$\n(0.29$^{\\circ}$) respectively.

These CNN-based methods generally map a\nlow-resolution image to its corresponding high-resolution version with\nsophisticated network structures and loss functions, showing impressive\nperformances. This paper provides a new insight on conventional SISR algorithm,\nand proposes a substantially different approach relying on the iterative\noptimization.

Extensive experimental results on testing\nbenchmarks with bicubic (BI) degradation show our ISRN can not only recover\nmore structural information, but also achieve competitive or better PSNR/SSIM\nresults with much fewer parameters compared to other works.

We argue that the common models underlying the experimental\nmeasurements of SFE fail in metastable alloys. In various concentrated solid\nsolutions, we demonstrate that the SFEs obtained by DFT calculations correlate\nwell with the primary deformation mechanisms observed experimentally, showing a\nbetter resolution than the experimentally measured SFEs.

This research takes root in the holographic\nprinciple, which conjectures that the geometry and the dynamic of a space-time\nregion can be entirely described by a theory living on the boundary of this\ngiven region. The most studied case of this principle is the AdS/CFT\ncorrespondence, where the quantum fluctuations of an asymptotically AdS space\nare described by a conformal field theory living at spatial infinity, invariant\nunder the Virasoro group. The philosophy applied in this thesis differs from\nthe AdS/CFT case. I focus on the case of quasi-local holography, i.e. for a\nbounded region of space-time with a boundary at a finite distance. The\nobjective is to clarify the bulk-boundary relation in quantum gravity described\nby the Ponzano-Regge model, defining a model for 3D gravity via a discrete path\nintegral.\n  I present the first perturbative and exact computations of the Ponzano-Regge\namplitude on a torus with a 2D boundary state. After the presentation of the\ngeneral framework for the 3D amplitude in terms of the 2D boundary state, I\nconsider the 2D torus case, with application in the study of the thermodynamics\nof the BTZ black hole. First, the 2D boundary is described by a coherent spin\nnetwork state in the semi-classical regime. The stationary phase approximation\nallows to recover in the asymptotic limit the usual amplitude for 3D quantum\ngravity as the character of the symmetry of asymptotically flat gravity, the\nBMS group. Then I introduce a new type of coherent boundary state, which allows\nan exact evaluation of the amplitude for 3D quantum gravity. I obtain a complex\nregularization of the BMS character. The possibility of this exact computation\nsuggests the existence of a (quasi)-integrable structure, linked to the\nsymmetries of 3D quantum gravity with 2D finite boundary.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 May 2020 12:07:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-21"}

A seminal result of\nGrohe, Schwentick, and Segoufin (STOC 2001) demonstrates that for every class\n$G$ of graphs, the evaluation of all conjunctive queries whose underlying graph\nis in $G$ is tractable if, and only if, $G$ has bounded treewidth. In this\nwork, we extend this characterization to the counting problem for conjunctive\nqueries. Specifically, for every class $C$ of conjunctive queries with bounded\ntreewidth, we introduce the first fully polynomial-time randomized\napproximation scheme (FPRAS) for counting answers to a query in $C$, and the\nfirst polynomial-time algorithm for sampling answers uniformly from a query in\n$C$. As a corollary, it follows that for every class $G$ of graphs, the\ncounting problem for conjunctive queries whose underlying graph is in $G$\nadmits an FPRAS if, and only if, $G$ has bounded treewidth (unless $\\text{BPP}\n\\neq \\text{P}$)}. In fact, our FPRAS is more general, and also applies to\nconjunctive queries with bounded hypertree width, as well as unions of such\nqueries.\n  The key ingredient in our proof is the resolution of a fundamental counting\nproblem from automata theory. Specifically, we demonstrate the first FPRAS and\npolynomial time sampler for the set of trees of size $n$ accepted by a tree\nautomaton, which improves the prior quasi-polynomial time randomized\napproximation scheme (QPRAS) and sampling algorithm of Gore, Jerrum, Kannan,\nSweedyk, and Mahaney '97. We demonstrate how this algorithm can be used to\nobtain an FPRAS for many hitherto open problems, such as counting solutions to\nconstraint satisfaction problems (CSP) with bounded hypertree-width, counting\nthe number of error threads in programs with nested call subroutines, and\ncounting valid assignments to structured DNNF circuits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 May 2020 13:21:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Nov 2020 15:02:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 20 Nov 2020 13:34:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-23"}

Deep learning has achieved impressive results in this field.\nHowever, the robustness of deep learning methods is still a concern for\nclinical applications due to the following two challenges: a) With limited\naccess to sufficient training data, a learned deep learning model may not\ngeneralize well to unseen data; b) Deep learning models are sensitive to noise.\nTherefore, the quality of images processed by neural networks only may be\ninadequate. In this work, we investigate the robustness of deep learning in CT\nimage reconstruction by showing false negative and false positive lesion cases.\nSince learning-based images with incorrect structures are likely not consistent\nwith measured projection data, we propose a data consistent reconstruction\n(DCR) method to improve their image quality, which combines the advantages of\ncompressed sensing and deep learning: First, a prior image is generated by deep\nlearning. Afterwards, unmeasured projection data are inpainted by forward\nprojection of the prior image. Finally, iterative reconstruction with\nreweighted total variation regularization is applied, integrating data\nconsistency for measured data and learned prior information for missing data.\nThe efficacy of the proposed method is demonstrated in cone-beam CT with\ntruncated data, limited-angle data and sparse-view data, respectively.

One important\nfactor to improve word error rate in both cases is the use of an external\nlanguage model (LM) trained on large text-only corpora. Language model\nintegration is straightforward with the clear separation of acoustic model and\nlanguage model in classical HMM-based modeling. In contrast, multiple\nintegration schemes have been proposed for attention models. In this work, we\npresent a novel method for language model integration into implicit-alignment\nbased sequence-to-sequence models. Log-linear model combination of acoustic and\nlanguage model is performed with a per-token renormalization. This allows us to\ncompute the full normalization term efficiently both in training and in\ntesting. This is compared to a global renormalization scheme which is\nequivalent to applying shallow fusion in training.

This is even more crucial in\nclinical applications where the predictive algorithms are designed mainly based\non a limited or given set of medical images and demographic variables such as\nage, sex and race are not taken into account. In this work, we conduct a survey\nof the MICCAI 2018 proceedings to investigate the common practice in medical\nimage analysis applications.

This cytokine storm can cause\nmultiple organ damage and death. Consequently, there is a pressing need to\nidentify therapies to treat and prevent severe symptoms during COVID-19. Based\non previous clinical evidence, we hypothesized that inhibiting T cell\nco-stimulation by blocking CD80/86 could be an effective therapeutic strategy\nagainst progression to severe proinflammatory states. To support this\nhypothesis, we performed an analysis integrating blood transcriptional data we\ngenerated from rheumatoid arthritis patients treated with abatacept -- a\nCD80/86 co-stimulation inhibitor -- with the pathological features associated\nwith COVID-19, particularly in its more severe forms. We have found that many\nof the biological processes that have been consistently associated with\nCOVID-19 pathology are reversed by CD80/86 co-stimulation inhibition, including\nthe downregulation of IL6 production. Also, analysis of previous\ntranscriptional data from blood of SARS-CoV-infected patients showed that the\nresponse to abatacept has a very high level of antagonism to that elicited by\nCOVID-19. Finally, analyzing a recent single cell RNA-seq dataset from\nbronchoalveolar lavage fluid cells from COVID-19 patients, we found a\nsignificant correlation along the main elements of the C80/86 axis: CD86+/80+\nantigen presenting cells, activated CD4+ T cells and IL6 production.

To address the distribution\nof natural language data, we then compare different strategies for word vector\nnorm-scaling. After that, we apply the best norm-scaling setup in combination\nwith various margins and conduct neural language models rescoring experiments\nin automatic speech recognition. We find that although perplexity is slightly\ndeteriorated, neural language models with large-margin softmax can yield word\nerror rate similar to that of the standard softmax baseline. Finally, expected\nmargins are analyzed through visualization of word vectors, showing that the\nsyntactic and semantic relationships are also preserved.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 May 2020 14:53:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Apr 2021 12:45:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-22"}

The findings of this work could motivate new\nexperimental settings to study quasi two-dimensional superfluid turbulence in\nthe bulk of three-dimensional experiments. They might also find applications\nbeyond superfluids in systems described by more than one fluid component.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 May 2020 15:05:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 17 Dec 2020 16:36:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-18"}

Most existing methods\ncan be categorized as \\emph{multi-view representation fusion}; they first build\none graph and then integrate multi-view data into a single compact\nrepresentation for each node in the graph. However, these methods are raising\nconcerns in both engineering and algorithm aspects: 1) multi-view data are\nabundant and informative in industry and may exceed the capacity of one single\nvector, and 2) inductive bias may be introduced as multi-view data are often\nfrom different distributions. In this paper, we use a \\emph{multi-view\nrepresentation alignment} approach to address this issue. Particularly, we\npropose a multi-task multi-view graph representation learning framework (M2GRL)\nto learn node representations from multi-view graphs for web-scale recommender\nsystems. M2GRL constructs one graph for each single-view data, learns multiple\nseparate representations from multiple graphs, and performs alignment to model\ncross-view relations. M2GRL chooses a multi-task learning paradigm to learn\nintra-view representations and cross-view relations jointly. Besides, M2GRL\napplies homoscedastic uncertainty to adaptively tune the loss weights of tasks\nduring training. We deploy M2GRL at Taobao and train it on 57 billion examples.\nAccording to offline metrics and online A/B tests, M2GRL significantly\noutperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms.

In this paper we empirically investigate the effect of\ndata input and output transformations on the predictive performance of several\nneural forecasting architectures. In particular, we investigate the\neffectiveness of several forms of data binning, i.e. converting real-valued\ntime series into categorical ones, when combined with feed-forward, recurrent\nneural networks, and convolution-based sequence models. In many non-forecasting\napplications where these models have been very successful, the model inputs and\noutputs are categorical (e.g. words from a fixed vocabulary in natural language\nprocessing applications or quantized pixel color intensities in computer\nvision). For forecasting applications, where the time series are typically\nreal-valued, various ad-hoc data transformations have been proposed, but have\nnot been systematically compared. To remedy this, we evaluate the forecasting\naccuracy of instances of the aforementioned model classes when combined with\ndifferent types of data scaling and binning. We find that binning almost always\nimproves performance (compared to using normalized real-valued inputs), but\nthat the particular type of binning chosen is of lesser importance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 May 2020 15:09:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-21"}

The review rating data for a recommender system\ntypically comes from open platforms, which may attract a group of malicious\nusers to deliberately insert fake feedback in an attempt to bias the\nrecommender system to their favour. The presence of such attacks may violate\nmodeling assumptions that high-quality data is always available and these data\ntruly reflect users' interests and preferences. Therefore, it is of great\npractical significance to construct a robust recommender system that is able to\ngenerate stable recommendations even in the presence of shilling attacks. In\nthis paper, we propose GraphRfi - a GCN-based user representation learning\nframework to perform robust recommendation and fraudster detection in a unified\nway. In its end-to-end learning process, the probability of a user being\nidentified as a fraudster in the fraudster detection component automatically\ndetermines the contribution of this user's rating data in the recommendation\ncomponent; while the prediction error outputted in the recommendation component\nacts as an important feature in the fraudster detection component. Thus, these\ntwo components can mutually enhance each other. Extensive experiments have been\nconducted and the experimental results show the superiority of our GraphRfi in\nthe two tasks - robust rating prediction and fraudster detection. Furthermore,\nthe proposed GraphRfi is validated to be more robust to the various types of\nshilling attacks over the state-of-the-art recommender systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 May 2020 15:57:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-21"}

In response to this\nfragility, adversarial training has emerged as a principled approach for\nenhancing the robustness of deep learning with respect to norm-bounded\nperturbations. However, there are other sources of fragility for deep learning\nthat are arguably more common and less thoroughly studied. Indeed, natural\nvariation such as lighting or weather conditions can significantly degrade the\naccuracy of trained neural networks, proving that such natural variation\npresents a significant challenge for deep learning.\n  In this paper, we propose a paradigm shift from perturbation-based\nadversarial robustness toward model-based robust deep learning. Our objective\nis to provide general training algorithms that can be used to train deep neural\nnetworks to be robust against natural variation in data. Critical to our\nparadigm is first obtaining a model of natural variation which can be used to\nvary data over a range of natural conditions. Such models may be either known a\npriori or else learned from data. In the latter case, we show that deep\ngenerative models can be used to learn models of natural variation that are\nconsistent with realistic conditions. We then exploit such models in three\nnovel model-based robust training algorithms in order to enhance the robustness\nof deep learning with respect to the given model.

We model this channel using a\ngeneralization of the binomial channel and show that the capacity-achieving\ninput distribution for this channel always has mass points at probabilities of\nparticle release of zero and one. To find the capacity-achieving input\ndistributions, we develop an efficient algorithm we call dynamic assignment\nBlahut-Arimoto (DAB). For diffusive particle transport, we also derive the\nconditions under which the input with two mass points is capacity-achieving.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 May 2020 06:24:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-22"}

Such missing observations are one of the\nmajor limitations of time series processing using deep learning. Practical\napplications, e.g., sensor data, healthcare, weather, generates data that is in\ntruth continuous in time, and informative missingness is a common phenomenon in\nthese datasets. These datasets often consist of multiple variables, and often\nthere are missing values for one or many of these variables.

Recently,\nseveral papers studied the construction of useful low-dimensional\nrepresentations (embeddings) of these networks for the prediction of missing\nrelations or signs. Existing embedding methods for sign prediction generally\nenforce different notions of status or balance theories in their optimization\nfunction. These theories, however, are often inaccurate or incomplete, which\nnegatively impacts method performance.\n  In this context, we introduce conditional signed network embedding (CSNE).\nOur probabilistic approach models structural information about the signs in the\nnetwork separately from fine-grained detail. Structural information is\nrepresented in the form of a prior, while the embedding itself is used for\ncapturing fine-grained information. These components are then integrated in a\nrigorous manner. CSNE's accuracy depends on the existence of sufficiently\npowerful structural priors for modelling signed networks, currently unavailable\nin the literature. Thus, as a second main contribution, which we find to be\nhighly valuable in its own right, we also introduce a novel approach to\nconstruct priors based on the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) principle. These priors\ncan model the \\emph{polarity} of nodes (degree to which their links are\npositive) as well as signed \\emph{triangle counts} (a measure of the degree\nstructural balance holds to in a network).\n  Experiments on a variety of real-world networks confirm that CSNE outperforms\nthe state-of-the-art on the task of sign prediction. Moreover, the MaxEnt\npriors on their own, while less accurate than full CSNE, achieve accuracies\ncompetitive with the state-of-the-art at very limited computational cost, thus\nproviding an excellent runtime-accuracy trade-off in resource-constrained\nsituations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 19 May 2020 19:14:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 25 May 2020 10:13:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-06"}

To date, no biocompatible technologies exist for\nnavigating microparticles upstream when they are in a background fluid flow.\nInspired by many naturally occurring microswimmers such as bacteria,\nspermatozoa, and plankton that utilize the non-slip boundary conditions of the\nwall to exhibit upstream propulsion, here, we report on the design and\ncharacterization of self-assembled microswarms that can execute upstream\nmotility in a combination of external acoustic and magnetic fields. Both\nacoustic and magnetic fields are safe to humans, non-invasive, can penetrate\ndeeply into the human body, and are well-developed in clinical settings. The\ncombination of both fields can overcome the limitations encountered by single\nactuation methods. The design criteria of the acoustically-induced reaction\nforce of the microswarms, which is needed to perform rolling-type motion, are\ndiscussed. We show quantitative agreement between experimental data and our\nmodel that captures the rolling behaviour.

An ISE is used to investigate the concentration of a specific\nion from aqueous solution, by measuring the Nernst potential along the glass\nmembrane. However, application of ISE on a mixture of multiple ion has some\nproblem. First problem is a chemical artifact which is called ion interference\neffect. Electrically charged particles interact with each other and flows\nthrough the glass membrane of different ISEs. Second problem is the kinetic\nartifact caused by the movement of the liquid. Water molecules collide with the\nglass membrane causing abnormal peak values of voltage. The last artifact is\nthe interference of ISEs. When multiple ISEs are dipped into same solution, one\nelectrode's signal emission interference voltage measurement of other\nelectrodes. Therefore, an ISE is recommended to be applied on single-ion\nsolution, without any other sensors applied at the same time. Deep learning\napproach can remove both 3 artifacts at the same time. The proposed method used\n5 layers of artificial neural networks to regress correct signal to remove\ncomplex artifacts with one-shot calculation.
