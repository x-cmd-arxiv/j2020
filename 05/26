Segmenting a continuous field\ninto discrete spatially contiguous subsets of pixels produces a spatial network\nin which each contiguous segment represents a distinct network component.\nRepresenting the continuum of lighted development as spatial networks of\nvarying spatial connectivity allows the generative conditions for power law\nnetwork structure to be applied in a spatial context to provide a general\nexplanation for similar scaling observed in settlements and other land cover\ntypes. This study introduces a novel methodology to combine complementary\nsources of satellite-derived night light observations to quantify the evolution\nof the global spatial network structure of lighted development from 1992 to\n2015.

As a first\nstep in analysis, deformable registration among different image modalities is\noften required in order to provide complementary visual information. During\nregistration, semantic information is key to match homologous points and\npixels. Nevertheless, many conventional registration methods are incapable in\ncapturing high-level semantic anatomical dense correspondences. In this work,\nwe propose a novel multi-task learning system, JSSR, based on an end-to-end 3D\nconvolutional neural network that is composed of a generator, a registration\nand a segmentation component. The system is optimized to satisfy the implicit\nconstraints between different tasks in an unsupervised manner. It first\nsynthesizes the source domain images into the target domain, then an\nintra-modal registration is applied on the synthesized images and target\nimages. The segmentation module are then applied on the synthesized and target\nimages, providing additional cues based on semantic correspondences. The\nsupervision from another fully-annotated dataset is used to regularize the\nsegmentation.

As a\nresult, one might be tempted to conclude that exceptional points (EPs)\ngenerally cannot be used to increase the precision of laser sensors. Indeed,\nusing a linear eigenmode analysis we show that the Petermann limit applies not\njust to maximally dissipative systems, but for any type of EP, owing to the\nfact that EPs are rotationally invariant. It turns out, however, that this\nrestriction comes from the assumption of linearity. We find that nonlinearity\nbreaks the rotation symmetry such that the different types of EPs are no longer\nequivalent above threshold. In particular, for sufficiently high measurement\nfrequencies, EPs in conservatively coupled systems having a saturation\nimbalance can lead to an increase in the fundamental precision beyond the\nPetermann limit. Importantly, we find that only one mode lases under these\nconditions. We show that the beat note can be recovered by interference with an\nauxiliary mode, but that this has consequences for the quantum and classical\nnoise that depend on the recovery scheme. Thus, it remains to be seen whether\npractical experiments can be designed that can take advantage of this\nenhancement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 May 2020 16:31:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Jun 2020 18:28:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 29 Oct 2021 20:59:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-02"}

Such kind of net topological charge can present as a quantized signal\nin the circular polarized light induced injection current.

In this paper, we study the problem of using energy storage\ndeployed in the grid to reduce the grid's carbon emissions.

But the limitations of computation capability and\nenergy consumption make it difficult to run complex machine learning algorithms\non IoT devices, especially when latency deadline exists. One solution is to\noffload the computation intensive tasks to the edge server. However, the\nwireless uploading of the raw data is time consuming and may lead to deadline\nviolation. To reduce the communication cost, lossy data compression can be\nexploited for inference tasks, but may bring more erroneous inference results.\nIn this paper, we propose a dynamic compression ratio selection scheme for edge\ninference system with hard deadlines. The key idea is to balance the tradeoff\nbetween communication cost and inference accuracy. By dynamically selecting the\noptimal compression ratio with the remaining deadline budgets for queued tasks,\nmore tasks can be timely completed with correct inference under limited\ncommunication resources. Furthermore, information augmentation that retransmits\nless compressed data of task with erroneous inference, is proposed to enhance\nthe accuracy performance. While it is often hard to know the correctness of\ninference, we use uncertainty to estimate the confidence of the inference, and\nbased on that, jointly optimize the information augmentation and compression\nratio selection. Lastly, considering the wireless transmission errors, we\nfurther design a retransmission scheme to reduce performance degradation due to\npacket losses. Simulation results show the performance of the proposed schemes\nunder different deadlines and task arrival rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 May 2020 17:11:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-26"}

A spanning tree is an $\\alpha$-spanning tree\n($\\alpha$-ST) of $G$ if, for any $i \\in V$, the smallest angle that encloses\nall line segments corresponding to its $i$-incident edges does not exceed\n$\\alpha$. $\\alpha$-MSTP consists in finding an $\\alpha$-ST with the least\nweight. We introduce two $\\alpha-$MSTP integer programming formulations,\n${\\mathcal F}_{xy}^*$ and $\\mathcal{F}_x^{++}$ and their accompanying\nBranch-and-cut (BC) algorithms, BCFXY$^*$ and BCFX$^{++}$. Both formulations\ncan be seen as improvements over formulations coming from the literature. The\nstrongest of them, $\\mathcal{F}_x^{++}$, was obtained by: (i) lifting an\nexisting set of inequalities in charge of enforcing $\\alpha$ angular\nconstraints and (ii) characterizing $\\alpha$-MSTP valid inequalities from the\nStable Set polytope, a structure behind $\\alpha-$STs, that we disclosed here.\nThese formulations and their predecessors in the literature were compared from\na polyhedral perspective. From a numerical standpoint, we observed that\nBCFXY$^*$ and BCFX$^{++}$ compare favorably to their competitors in the\nliterature. In fact, thanks to the quality of the bounds provided by\n$\\mathcal{F}_x^{++}$, BCFX$^{++}$ seems to outperform the other existing\n$\\alpha-$MSTP algorithms. It is able to solve more instances to proven\noptimality and to provide sharper lower bounds, when optimality is not attested\nwithin an imposed time limit. As a by-product, BCFX$^{++}$ provided 8 new\noptimality certificates for instances coming from the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 May 2020 17:41:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-26"}

Unfortunately, reserving VMs exposes users to \\emph{demand\nrisk} that can increase cost if their expected future demand does not\nmaterialize. Since accurately forecasting demand over long periods is\nchallenging, users often limit their use of reserved VMs. To mitigate demand\nrisk, Amazon operates a Reserved Instance Marketplace (RIM) where users may\npublicly list the remaining time on their VM reservations for sale at a price\nthey set. The RIM enables users to limit demand risk by either selling VM\nreservations if their demand changes, or purchasing variable- and shorter-term\nVM reservations that better match their demand forecast horizon. Clearly, the\nRIM's potential to mitigate demand risk is a function of its price\ncharacteristics.

However, dark matter (DM) may have the unique possibility of\nexhibiting naturally prolonged macroscopic quantum properties due to its weak\ncoupling to its environment, particularly if it only interacts gravitationally.\nIn this work, we compute the rate of decoherence for light DM in the galaxy,\nwhere a local density has its mass, size, and location in a quantum\nsuperposition. The decoherence is via the gravitational interaction of the DM\noverdensity with its environment, provided by ordinary matter.

Self-replication would potentially allow for an exponential\nincrease in the number of probes and thereby drastically improve the efficiency\nof space exploration. Despite this potential, an integrated assessment of\nself-replicating space probes has not been presented since the 1980s, and it is\nstill unclear how far they are feasible. In this paper, we propose a concept\nfor a partially self-replicating probe for space exploration based on current\nand near-term technologies, with a focus on small spacecraft. The purpose is to\nchart a path towards self-replication with near-term benefits, rather than\nattempting full self-replication. For this reason, components such as\nmicrochips and other microelectronic components are brought with the initial\nprobe and are not replicated.

While the current research mainly focuses on optimizing\nlearning algorithms and minimizing communication overhead left by distributed\nlearning, there is still a considerable gap when it comes to the real\nimplementation on mobile devices. In this paper, we start with an empirical\nexperiment to demonstrate computation heterogeneity is a more pronounced\nbottleneck than communication on the current generation of battery-powered\nmobile devices, and the existing methods are haunted by mobile stragglers.\nFurther, non-identically distributed data across the mobile users makes the\nselection of participants critical to the accuracy and convergence. To tackle\nthe computational and statistical heterogeneity, we utilize data as a tuning\nknob and propose two efficient polynomial-time algorithms to schedule different\nworkloads on various mobile devices, when data is identically or\nnon-identically distributed. For identically distributed data, we combine\npartitioning and linear bottleneck assignment to achieve near-optimal training\ntime without accuracy loss.

Our purpose is not to advocate for such observer selection effects,\nbut rather to show that any such effects depend greatly on the assumptions\nmade. We focus on the debate about the existence of a `Doomsday\neffect'---whether observer index information should cause one to favor\npossibilities with fewer observers, which has been argued to have implications\nfor models of cosmology. Our central goal is to reconcile the apparent\ninconsistencies in the literature by introducing a formalism to lay bare\nassumptions made and address a key issue that has not been clearly articulated\nin such problems: whether the observer is selected by *picking from* or *being\nin* a set of worlds. In the former there generally are observer selection\neffects, and in the latter there generally are not. This leads us to\ndifferentiate what we call *inclusive* from *exclusive* selection, and how they\nrelate to the concept of a multiverse. Then we relax the assumption that all\nobservers are equally typical, and consider the problem of Boltzmann brains,\nshowing that typicality can play a role in solving the problem. We then stress\nthe need for scale-invariant questions, which causes us to analyze J. Richard\nGott's approach to the problem. This all allows us to analyze the Doomsday and\nUniversal Doomsday arguments. We find that there is no Doomsday effect, absent\na set of assumptions we find somewhat unreasonable. Then we use our formalism\nto resolve a debate in the philosophy community called the `Sleeping Beauty\nProblem.' Finally, we conclude with a heuristic summary, free from equations,\nand point to possible future directions of this line of research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 May 2020 18:52:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Sep 2020 21:34:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-15"}

Secure Multi-Execution (SME)\npromises to provide secure IFC without modifying the behaviour of already\nsecure programs, a property known as transparency. Implementations of SME exist\nfor the web and as plug-ins to several programming languages. Furthermore, SME\ncan in theory work in a black-box manner, meaning that it can be programming\nlanguage agnostic, making it perfect for securing legacy or third-party\nsystems. As such SME, and its variants like Multiple Facets (MF) and Faceted\nSecure Multi-Execution (FSME), appear to be a family of panaceas for the\nsecurity engineer. The question is, how come, given all these advantages, that\nthese techniques are not ubiquitous in practice? The answer lies, partially, in\nthe issue of runtime and memory overhead. SME and its variants are\nprohibitively expensive to deploy in many non-trivial situations. Why is this\nthe case? On the surface, the reason is simple. The techniques in the SME\nfamily all rely on the idea of multi-execution, running all or parts of a\nprogram multiple times to achieve noninterference. Naturally, this causes\noverhead. However, the goal in the IFC community has been to overcome these\noverheads. In this paper we argue that there are fundamental reasons to expect\nthis not to be possible and prove two key theorems: 1. All transparent\nenforcement is polynomial time equivalent to multi-execution. 2. All black-box\nenforcement takes time exponential in the number of principals in the security\nlattice. We also answer, in the affirmative, an open question about the\npossibility of transparently enforcing the TINI security condition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 May 2020 18:58:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-27"}

We make this step\nexplicit by characterising it as an imputation problem, and empirically assess\nthe impact of various imputation strategies when applying signature-based\nneural nets to irregular time series data. For one of these strategies,\nGaussian process (GP) adapters, we propose an extension~(GP-PoM) that makes\nuncertainty information directly available to the subsequent classifier while\nat the same time preventing costly Monte-Carlo (MC) sampling. In our\nexperiments, we find that the choice of imputation drastically affects shallow\nsignature models, whereas deeper architectures are more robust.

The early enrichment model, in which\nthe majority of metals are produced in the core of cluster progenitors at high\nredshift, suggests that metals in cluster outskirts have not significantly\nevolved since $z=2$. With the C-EAGLE sample, we find reasonable agreement with\nthe early enrichment model as there is very little scatter in the metallicity\nabundance at large radius across the whole sample, out to at least $z=2$. The\nexception is Fe for which the radial dependence of metallicity was found to\nevolve at low redshift as a result of being mainly produced by Type Ia\nsupernovae, which are more likely to be formed at later times than\ncore-collapse supernovae. We also found considerable redshift evolution of\nmetal abundances in the cores of the C-EAGLE clusters which has not been seen\nin other simulations or observation based metallicity studies.

Most popular fuzzers generate new inputs using an evolutionary\nsearch to maximize code coverage. Essentially, these fuzzers start with a set\nof seed inputs, mutate them to generate new inputs, and identify the promising\ninputs using an evolutionary fitness function for further mutation. Despite\ntheir success, evolutionary fuzzers tend to get stuck in long sequences of\nunproductive mutations.

Three other models involving the use of LSTMs and 1D\nConvNets are also compared with our best model.

A major confound has been the use of diverse methods to\nestimate ethanol consumption.

Both sexes\nshowed ethanol preference that was abolished on high nutrient concentration\ndiets. Additionally, manipulating total food intake without altering the\nnutritive value of the base diet or the ethanol concentration was sufficient to\nevoke or eliminate ethanol preference. Absolute ethanol intake and food volume\nconsumed were stronger predictors of ethanol preference than caloric intake or\nthe dietary caloric content. Our findings suggest that the effect of the base\ndiet on ethanol preference is largely mediated by total consumption associated\nwith the delivery medium, which ultimately determines the level of ethanol\nintake.

First, qDKT\nincorporates graph Laplacian regularization to smooth predictions under each\nskill, which is particularly useful when the number of questions in the dataset\nis big. Second, qDKT uses an initialization scheme inspired by the fastText\nalgorithm, which has found success in a variety of language modeling tasks. Our\nexperiments on several real-world datasets show that qDKT achieves state-of-art\nperformance on predicting learner outcomes. Because of this, qDKT can serve as\na simple, yet tough-to-beat, baseline for new question-centric KT models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 May 2020 23:43:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-27"}

A big problem is that there is no actual social distancing data, and\nthe corresponding people behavior in a pandemic is unknown. We collect the\nworld-first dataset on social distancing during the COVID-19 outbreak, so to\nsee for the first time how people really implement social distancing, identify\ndangers of the current situation, and find solutions against this and future\npandemics.\n  Methods: Using a sensor-based social distancing belt we collected social\ndistance data from people in Italy for over two months during the most critical\nCOVID-19 outbreak. Additionally, we investigated if and how wearing various\nPersonal Protection Equipment, like masks, influences social distancing.\n  Results: Without masks, people adopt a counter-intuitively dangerous\nstrategy, a paradox that could explain the relative lack of effectiveness of\nsocial distancing. Using masks radically changes the situation, breaking the\nparadoxical behavior and leading to a safe social distance behavior.

Several key properties of framelets are high\nvanishing moments for sparse multiscale representation, fast framelet\ntransforms for numerical efficiency, and redundancy for robustness. However, it\nis a challenging problem to study and construct multivariate nonseparable\nframelets, mainly due to their intrinsic connections to factorization and\nsyzygy modules of multivariate polynomial matrices. In this paper, we\ncircumvent the above difficulties through the approach of quasi-tight\nframelets, which behave almost identically to tight framelets.

Various\nvortex identification criteria have been proposed to extract the vortex\nfilaments from available velocity fields, which is an essential procedure in\nthe practice of the vortex representation. This work focuses on the\neffectiveness of those identification criteria in the compressed representation\nof wall-bounded turbulence. Five local identification criteria regarding the\nvortex strength and three criteria for the vortex axis are considered. To\nfacilitate the comparisons, this work first non-dimensionalize the criteria of\nthe vortex strength based on their dimensions and root mean squares, with\ncorresponding equivalent thresholds prescribed. The optimal definition for the\nvortex vector is discussed by trialling all the possible combinations of the\nidentification criteria for the vortex strength and the vortex axis. The\neffectiveness of those criteria in the compressed representation is evaluated\nbased on two principles: (1) efficient compression, which implies the less\ninformation required, the better for the representation; (2) accurate\ndecompression, which stresses that the original velocity fields could be\nreconstructed based on the vortex representation in high accuracy. In practice,\nthe alignment of the identified vortex axis and vortex isosurface, and the\naccuracy for decompressed velocity fields based on those criteria are\nquantitatively compared. The alignment degree is described by using the\ndifferential geometry method, and the decompressing process is implemented via\nthe two-dimensional field-based linear stochastic estimation.

Here we reproduce the\nharmonic state of lasing in QCLs by space-time-domain numerical simulations and\nshow that the corresponding optical wave has a frequency-modulated (FM) nature,\nwith the fundamental beat note in the electron population being suppressed. To\nunderstand the physics behind the formation and stability of the harmonic\nstate, we develop a frequency-domain linearized analytic theory which analyzes\nthe stability of single mode lasing with respect to the harmonic state\nformation and the instabilities of the resulting harmonic state.

The coupling between the two side modes leads to opposite\ngains for FM and amplitude-modulated (AM) waves, and the FM gain is enhanced as\ncompared to the AM gain. The dependence of the sideband gain spectrum on group\nvelocity dispersion is also studied.

This is an NP-hard optimization\nproblem with real-world applications in the fields of transportation,\nlogistics, and supply chain management. We consider heterogeneous depots and\nvehicles with different capacities. Given a set of heterogeneous depots, the\nnumber of vehicles in each depot, heterogeneous depot/vehicle capacities, and a\nset of spatially distributed customer locations, the MDCVRP attempts to\nidentify routes of various vehicles satisfying the capacity constraints such as\nthat all the customers are served. We model MDCVRP as a quadratic unconstrained\nbinary optimization (QUBO) problem, which minimizes the overall distance\ntraveled by all the vehicles across all depots given the capacity constraints.\nFurthermore, we formulate a QUBO model for dynamic version of MDCVRP known as\nD-MDCVRP, which involves dynamic rerouting of vehicles to real-time customer\nrequests.

Power management is one of the key energy-saving strategies used in\nwearable networks. Signals enter the receiver (Rx) from a transmitter (Tx)\nthrough the human body in the form of electromagnetic field (EMF) radiation\nproduced during the transmission of the packet. It may have a negative effect\non human health as a result of specific absorption rate (SAR). SAR is the\namount of radio frequency energy consumed by human tissue in mass units. The\nhigher the body's absorption rate, the more radio frequency radiation.\nTherefore, SAR can be reduced by distributing the power over a greater mass or\ntissue volume equivalently larger.

In fact, social distancing has long been practiced in nature among\nsolitary species, and been taken by human as an effective way of stopping or\nslowing down the spread of infectious diseases. Here we consider a social\ndistancing problem for how a population, when in a world with a network of\nsocial sites, decides to visit or stay at some sites while avoiding or closing\ndown some others so that the social contacts across the network can be\nminimized. We model this problem as a network population game, where every\nindividual tries to find some network sites to visit or stay so that he/she can\nminimize all his/her social contacts. In the end, an optimal strategy can be\nfound for every one, when the game reaches an equilibrium. We show that a large\nclass of equilibrium strategies can be obtained by selecting a set of social\nsites that forms a so-called maximal r-regular subnetwork. The latter includes\nmany well studied network types, which are easy to identify or construct, and\ncan be completely disconnected (with r = 0) for the most strict isolation, or\nallow certain degree of connectivities (with r > 0) for more flexible\ndistancing.

To address these\nissues, we propose the multi-view item network (MVIN), a GNN-based\nrecommendation model which provides superior recommendations by describing\nitems from a unique mixed view from user and entity angles. MVIN learns item\nrepresentations from both the user view and the entity view.

The proposed method explores Bayesian probability for\nskin portions using color values at both pixel and component levels of temporal\nframes, which provides fused images with skin components.

Robust speech\nsynthesis model depends on high quality and customized data which needs lots of\ncollecting efforts. It is worth investigating how to take advantage of\nlow-quality and low resource voice data which can be easily obtained from the\nInternet for usage of synthesizing personalized voice. In this paper, the\nproposed end-to-end speech synthesis model uses both speaker embedding and\nnoise representation as conditional inputs to model speaker and noise\ninformation respectively. Firstly, the speech synthesis model is pre-trained\nwith both multi-speaker clean data and noisy augmented data; then the\npre-trained model is adapted on noisy low-resource new speaker data; finally,\nby setting the clean speech condition, the model can synthesize the new\nspeaker's clean voice. Experimental results show that the speech generated by\nthe proposed approach has better subjective evaluation results than the method\ndirectly fine-tuning pre-trained multi-speaker speech synthesis model with\ndenoised new speaker data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 May 2020 06:14:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Oct 2020 11:36:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-23"}

However, the studies on\nthe fine-grained 3D shape classification have rarely been explored, due to the\nlack of fine-grained 3D shape benchmarks. To address this issue, we first\nintroduce a new 3D shape dataset (named FG3D dataset) with fine-grained class\nlabels, which consists of three categories including airplane, car and chair.\nEach category consists of several subcategories at a fine-grained level.\nAccording to our experiments under this fine-grained dataset, we find that\nstate-of-the-art methods are significantly limited by the small variance among\nsubcategories in the same category. To resolve this problem, we further propose\na novel fine-grained 3D shape classification method named FG3D-Net to capture\nthe fine-grained local details of 3D shapes from multiple rendered views.\nSpecifically, we first train a Region Proposal Network (RPN) to detect the\ngenerally semantic parts inside multiple views under the benchmark of generally\nsemantic part detection. Then, we design a hierarchical part-view attention\naggregation module to learn a global shape representation by aggregating\ngenerally semantic part features, which preserves the local details of 3D\nshapes. The part-view attention module hierarchically leverages part-level and\nview-level attention to increase the discriminability of our features. The\npart-level attention highlights the important parts in each view while the\nview-level attention highlights the discriminative views among all the views of\nthe same object.

However, this kind of\nmeter-sized grating with high quality is hard to manufacture so far. Here, we\npropose a new in-house beam-splitting compressor based on the property that the\ndamage threshold of gratings depend on the pulse duration. The new scheme will\nsimultaneously improve the stability, save expensive gratings, and simplify the\nsize of compressor because the split beams share the first two parallel\ngratings. Furthermore, based on the fact that the transmitted wavefront of a\nglass plate can be much better and more precisely controlled than that of the\ndiffraction wavefront of a large grating, then glass plates with designed\ntransmitted wavefront are proposed to compensate the wavefront distortion\nintroduced by the second, the third gratings, and other optics in-house such as\nthe beam splitter. This simple and economical method can compensate the\nspace-time distortion in the compressor and then improve the focal intensity,\nwhich otherwise cannot be compensated by the deformable mirror outside the\ncompressor due to angular chirp.

Tackling the shift is known as Domain Adaptation\n(DA). In this work, we focus on unsupervised DA: maintaining the detection\naccuracy across different data distributions, when only unlabeled images are\navailable of the target domain. Recent state-of-the-art methods try to reduce\nthe domain gap using an adversarial training strategy which increases the\nperformance but at the same time the complexity of the training procedure. In\ncontrast, we look at the problem from a new perspective and keep it simple by\nsolely matching image statistics between source and target domain. We propose\nto align either color histograms or mean and covariance of the source images\ntowards the target domain. Hence, DA is accomplished without architectural\nadd-ons and additional hyper-parameters. The benefit of the approaches is\ndemonstrated by evaluating different domain shift scenarios on public data\nsets. In comparison to recent methods, we achieve state-of-the-art performance\nusing a much simpler procedure for the training.

Specifically, we\npropose an algorithm that can efficiently learn explainable and generalized\naction selection rules by taking advantages of the representation of\nquantitative heuristics and an opponent model with an eXtended classifier\nsystem (XCS) in zero-sum Markov games. A neural network is used to model the\nopponent from their behaviors and the corresponding policy is inferred for\naction selection and rule evolution.

The analysis shows\nthat the presence of anti-parallel whistler waves in the pristine solar wind is\nmore likely to be obscured by turbulent magnetic field fluctuations, because of\nlower frequencies and smaller amplitudes compared to parallel whistler waves.\nThe presented results will be also valuable for numerical simulations of the\nelectron heat flux regulation in the solar wind.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 May 2020 09:54:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

On the kinetic scale, the\ndynamics of micro flow can be described by the linearized kinetic equation. In\nthe continuum regime, hydrodynamic equations such as linearized Navier-Stokes\nequations and Euler equations can be derived from the linearized kinetic\nequation by the Chapman-Enskog asymptotic analysis. In this paper, based on the\nlinearized kinetic equation we are going to propose a unified gas kinetic\nscheme scheme (UGKS) for micro flow simulation, which is an effective\nmultiscale scheme in the whole micro flow regime. The important methodology of\nUGKS is the following. Firstly, the evolution of microscopic distribution\nfunction is coupled with the evolution of macroscopic flow quantities.\nSecondly, the numerical flux of UGKS is constructed based on the integral\nsolution of kinetic equation, which provides a genuinely multiscale and\nmultidimensional numerical flux. The UGKS recovers the linear kinetic solution\nin the rarefied regime, and converges to the linear hydrodynamic solution in\nthe continuum regime. An outstanding feature of UGKS is its capability of\ncapturing the accurate viscous solution even when the cell size is much larger\nthan the kinetic kinetic length scale, such as the capturing of the viscous\nboundary layer with a cell size ten times larger than the particle mean free\npath. Such a multiscale property is called unified preserving (UP) which has\nbeen studied in \\cite{guo2019unified}. In this paper, we are also going to give\na mathematical proof for the UP property of UGKS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 May 2020 10:19:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-27"}

We have\nimplemented and tested a novel front-end binning design in a photon-integrating\nhybrid pixel array detector using the MM-PAD-2.0 pixel architecture. In this\narchitecture, the pixels can be optionally binned in a 2$\\times$2 pixel\nconfiguration using a network of switches to selectively direct the output of 4\nsensor pixels to a single amplifier input. Doing this allows a trade-off\nbetween frame rate and spatial resolution. Tests show that the binned pixels\nperform well, but with some degradation on performance as compared to an\nun-binned pixel. The increased parasitic input capacitance does reduce the\nsignal collected per x-ray as well as increases the noise of the pixel. The\nincrease in noise is, however, less than the factor of 2 increase one would\nobserve for binning in post-processing. Spatial scans across the binned pixels\nshow that no measured signal intensity is lost at the inner binning unit\nboundaries. In the high flux regime, at a 2$\\times$2 pixel wide beam spot\n(FWHM) size, binned mode responds linearly up to a photon flux of ~10$^{7}$\nx-rays/s, and performs comparably with un-binned mode up to a photon flux of\n~10$^{8}$ x-rays/s.

As a first step, we demonstrate this\ntechnique through the analysis of synthetic short-duration Event Horizon\nTelescope (EHT) observations of various geometric source models at 230 GHz, in\nthe presence of baseline-dependent thermal noise. We perform Bayesian parameter\nestimation and model selection between the different source models to obtain\nreliable uncertainty estimates and correlations between various source and\nfringe-fitting related model parameters. We also compare the Bayesian\nposteriors with those obtained using widely-used VLBI data reduction packages\nsuch as CASA and AIPS, by fringe-fitting 200 Monte Carlo simulations of each\nsource model with different noise realisations, to obtain distributions of the\nMaximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimates. We find that, in the presence of resolved\nasymmetric source structure and a given array geometry, the traditional\npractice of fringe-fitting with a point source model yields appreciable offsets\nin the estimated phase residuals, potentially biasing or limiting the dynamic\nrange of the starting model used for self-calibration. Simultaneously\nestimating the source structure earlier in the calibration process with formal\nuncertainties improves the precision and accuracy of fringe-fitting and\nestablishes the potential of the available data especially when there is little\nprior information. We also note the potential applications of this method to\nastrometry and geodesy for specific science cases and the planned improvements\nto the computational performance and analyses of more complex source\ndistributions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 May 2020 12:21:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-10"}

The standard DSA theory\npredicts an electron spectral index of $p=2$, corresponding to a radio spectral\nindex of $\\alpha=-0.5$. An extension of DSA predicts that the accelerated\nparticles changes the shock structure, resulting in a spectrum that is steeper\nthan $p>2$ ($\\alpha<-0.5$) at low energies and flattens with energy. For Cas A,\na synchrotron spectral flattening was previously reported for a small part of\nthe remnant in the mid-infrared regime. Here, we present new measurements for\nspectral flattening using archival radio (4.72~GHz) and mid-infrared\n(3.6~$\\mu$m) data, and produce a complete spectral index map to investigate the\nspatial variations within the remnant. We compare this to measurements of the\nradio spectral index from L-(1.285~GHz) and C-(4.64~GHz) band maps. Our result\nshows overall spectral flattening across the remnant ($\\alpha _\\mathrm{R-IR}\n\\sim -0.5$ to $-0.7$), to be compared to the radio spectral index of\n$\\alpha_{\\rm R}=-0.77$. The flattest values coincide with the locations of most\nrecent particle acceleration. In addition to overall flattening, we detect a\nrelatively steeper region in the southeast of the remnant ($\\alpha\n_\\mathrm{R-IR} \\sim -0.67$). We explore whether these locally steeper spectra\ncould be the result of synchrotron cooling, which provides constraints on the\nlocal magnetic-field strengths/age of the plasma, suggesting $B\\lesssim 2$~mG\nfor an age of 100~yr, and even $B\\lesssim 1$~mG using the age of Cas A, in\nagreement with other estimates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 26 May 2020 13:01:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2020 14:25:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-10"}

A recently proposed quantum imaginary-time evolution method (QITE)\nfaces problems of deep circuit depth and difficulty in the implementation on\nnoisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. In this study, a nonlocal\napproximation is developed to tackle this difficulty. We found that by removing\nthe locality condition or local approximation (LA), which was imposed when the\nimaginary-time evolution operator is converted to a unitary operator, the\nquantum circuit depth is significantly reduced. We propose two-step\napproximation methods based on a nonlocality condition: extended LA (eLA) and\nnonlocal approximation (NLA). To confirm the validity of eLA and NLA, we apply\nthem to the max-cut problem of an unweighted 3-regular graph and a weighted\nfully connected graph; we comparatively evaluate the performances of LA, eLA,\nand NLA. The eLA and NLA methods require far fewer circuit depths than LA to\nmaintain the same level of computational accuracy. Further, we developed a\n``compression'' method of the quantum circuit for the imaginary-time steps as a\nmethod to further reduce the circuit depth in the QITE method.

For example, Byzantine agreement is needed to build a\nblockchain, a totally ordered log of records. Blockchains are asynchronous\ndistributed systems, fault-tolerant against Byzantine nodes.\n  In the literature, the asynchronous byzantine agreement problem is studied in\na fully connected network model where every node can directly send messages to\nevery other node. This assumption is questionable in many real-world\nenvironments. In the reality, nodes might need to communicate by means of an\nincomplete network, and Byzantine nodes might not forward messages.\nFurthermore, Byzantine nodes might not behave correctly and, for example,\ncorrupt messages. Therefore, in order to truly understand Byzantine Agreement,\nwe need both ingredients: asynchrony and incomplete communication networks.\n  In this paper, we study the asynchronous Byzantine agreement problem in\nincomplete networks. A classic result by Danny Dolev proved that in a\ndistributed system with n nodes in the presence of f Byzantine nodes, the\nvertex connectivity of the system communication graph should be at least\n(2f+1).

While emerging patterns often show one\nspecific symmetry (e.g. nematic lane patterns or polarized traveling flocks),\ndepending on the symmetry of the alignment interactions patterns with different\nsymmetries can apparently coexist. Indeed, recent experiments with an actomysin\nmotility assay suggest that polar and nematic patterns of actin filaments can\ninteract and dynamically transform into each other. However, theoretical\nunderstanding of the mechanism responsible remains elusive. Here, we present a\nkinetic approach complemented by a hydrodynamic theory for agents with mixed\nalignment symmetries, which captures the experimentally observed phenomenology\nand provides a theoretical explanation for the coexistence and interaction of\npatterns with different symmetries.

To show this, we shall derive the most\ngeneral relation between the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ and the spectral index\nof primordial curvature perturbations $n_s$, namely the $r-n_s$ relation, by\nassuming that the slow-roll condition constrains the values of the slow-roll\nindices. As we show, the relation between the tensor-to-scalar ratio and the\nspectral index of the primordial curvature perturbations has the form $r\\simeq\n\\frac{48 (1-n_s)^2}{(4-x)^2}$, where the dimensionless parameter $x$ contains\nhigher derivatives of the $F(R)$ gravity function with respect to the Ricci\nscalar, and it is a function of the $e$-foldings number $N$ and may also be a\nfunction of the free parameters of the various $F(R)$ gravity models. For\n$F(R)$ gravities which have a spectral index compatible with the observational\ndata and also yield $x\\ll 1$, these belong to the $R^2$-type of attractors,\nwith $r\\sim 3 (1-n_s)^2$, and these are viable theories. Moreover, in the case\nthat $x$ takes larger values in specific ranges and is constant for a given\n$F(R)$ gravity, the resulting $r-n_s$ relation has the form $r\\sim 3 \\alpha\n(1-n_s)^2$, where $\\alpha$ is a constant. Thus we conclude that the viable\n$F(R)$ gravities may be classified into two limiting types of $r-n_s$\nrelations, one identical to the $R^2$ model at leading order in $x$, and one\nsimilar to the $\\alpha$-attractors $r-n_s$ relation, for the $F(R)$ gravity\nmodels that yield $x$ constant.

Many of these challenges originate\nfrom the error characteristics that stem from rapid decoherence and noise\nduring measurement, qubit connections, crosstalk, the qubits themselves, and\ntransformations of qubit state via gates. Not only are qubits not \"created\nequal\", but their noise level also changes over time. IBM is said to calibrate\ntheir quantum systems once per day and reports noise levels (errors) at the\ntime of such calibration. This information is subsequently used to map circuits\nto higher quality qubits and connections up to the next calibration point.\n  This work provides evidence that there is room for improvement over this\ndaily calibration cycle. It contributes a technique to measure noise levels\n(errors) related to qubits immediately before executing one or more sensitive\ncircuits and shows that just-in-time noise measurements benefit late physical\nqubit mappings.

Upcoming exascale supercomputational facilities will enable\nperforming simulations of galaxies and their formation by resolving individual\nstars (star-by-star simulations). This will substantially advance our\nunderstanding of star formation in galaxies, star cluster formation, and\nassembly histories of galaxies. In previous galaxy simulations, a simple\nstellar population approximation was used. It is, however, difficult to improve\nthe mass resolution with this approximation. Therefore, a model for forming\nindividual stars that can be used in simulations of galaxies must be\nestablished. In this first paper of a series of the SIRIUS (SImulations\nResolving IndividUal Stars) project, we demonstrate a stochastic star formation\nmodel for star-by-star simulations. An assumed stellar initial mass function\n(IMF) is randomly assigned to newly formed stars. We introduce a maximum search\nradius to assemble the mass from surrounding gas particles to form star\nparticles. In this study, we perform a series of N-body/smoothed particle\nhydrodynamics simulations of star cluster formations from turbulent molecular\nclouds and ultra-faint dwarf galaxies as test cases. The IMF can be correctly\nsampled if a maximum search radius that is larger than the value estimated from\nthe threshold density for star formation is adopted. In small clouds, the\nformation of massive stars is highly stochastic because of the small number of\nstars. We confirm that the star formation efficiency and threshold density do\nnot strongly affect the results. We find that our model can naturally reproduce\nthe relationship between the most massive stars and the total stellar mass of\nstar clusters. Herein, we demonstrate that our models can be applied to\nsimulations varying from star clusters to galaxies for a wide range of\nresolutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 25 May 2020 18:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 13 Mar 2021 02:45:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 17 Apr 2021 05:49:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-26"}

This work\npresents a learning-based method to synthetize DECT images from SECT for proton\nradiation therapy. Methods: The proposed method uses a residual attention\ngenerative adversarial network.

However, this approach has the main drawback that obtaining a\nnear-perfect alignment of the domains in itself might be difficult/impossible\n(e.g., language domains).
