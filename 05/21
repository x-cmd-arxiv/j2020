It is due to light reflected from the surface's\nmany nooks and crannies accumulating vastly-discrepant time delays, spanning\nmuch more than an optical period, en route to an observation point. Although\nspeckle with continuous-wave (cw) illumination is well understood, the emerging\ninterest in non-line-of-sight (NLoS) imaging using coherent light has created\nthe need to understand the higher-order speckle that results from multiple\nrough-surface reflections, viz., speckled speckle and speckled speckled\nspeckle. Moreover, the recent introduction of phasor-field\n($\\mathcal{P}$-field) NLoS imaging---which relies on amplitude-modulated\ncoherent illumination---requires pushing beyond cw scenarios for speckle and\nhigher-order speckle. In this paper, we take first steps in addressing the\nforegoing needs using a three-diffuser transmissive geometry that is a proxy\nfor three-bounce NLoS imaging. In the small-diffusers limit, we show that the\nirradiance variances of cw and modulated $n$th-order speckle coincide and are\n$(2^n-1)$-times those of ordinary (first-order) speckle. The more important\ncase for NLoS imaging, however, involves extended diffuse reflectors. For our\ntransmissive geometry with extended diffusers, we treat third-order cw speckle\nand first-order modulated speckle. Our results there imply that speckle is\nunlikely to impede successful operation of coherent-illumination cw imagers,\nand they suggest that the same might be true for $\\mathcal{P}$-field imagers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 May 2020 16:16:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Jun 2020 20:57:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

While a number of studies proposed novel methods of\nrepresenting expertise within individual projects, these methods are difficult\nto apply at an ecosystem level. However, with the focus of software development\nshifting from monolithic to modular, a method of representing developers'\nexpertise in the context of the entire OSS development becomes necessary when,\nfor example, a project tries to find new maintainers and look for developers\nwith relevant skills. Aim: We aim to address this knowledge gap by proposing\nand constructing the Skill Space where each API, developer, and project is\nrepresented and postulate how the topology of this space should reflect what\ndevelopers know (and projects need). Method: we use the World of Code\ninfrastructure to extract the complete set of APIs in the files changed by open\nsource developers and, based on that data, employ Doc2Vec embeddings for vector\nrepresentations of APIs, developers, and projects. We then evaluate if these\nembeddings reflect the postulated topology of the Skill Space by predicting\nwhat new APIs/projects developers use/join, and whether or not their pull\nrequests get accepted. We also check how the developers' representations in the\nSkill Space align with their self-reported API expertise. Result: Our results\nsuggest that the proposed embeddings in the Skill Space appear to satisfy the\npostulated topology and we hope that such representations may aid in the\nconstruction of signals that increase trust (and efficiency) of open source\necosystems at large and may aid investigations of other phenomena related to\ndeveloper proficiency and learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 May 2020 16:36:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2020 13:20:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 2021 11:43:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}

We report a surprising class of electronic\nin-gap edge states in pseudospin-1 materials without the conventional need of\nband-inversion topological phase transitions or introducing magnetism via an\nexternal magnetic type of interactions. In particular, we find that, in\ntwo-dimensional gapped (insulating) Dirac systems of massive spin-1\nquasiparticles, in-gap edge modes can emerge through only an {\\em electrostatic\npotential} applied to a finite domain. Associated with these unconventional\nedge modes are spontaneous formation of pronounced domain-wall spin textures,\nwhich exhibit the feature of out-of-plane spin-angular momentum locking on both\nsides of the domain boundary and are quite robust against boundary deformations\nand impurities despite a lack of an explicit topological origin. The in-gap\nmodes are formally three-component evanescent wave solutions, akin to the\nJackiw-Rebbi type of bound states. Such modes belong to a distinct class due to\nthe following physical reasons: three-component spinor wave function, unusual\nboundary conditions, and a shifted flat band induced by the external scalar\npotential. Not only is the finding of fundamental importance, but it also paves\nthe way for generating highly controllable in-gap edge states with emergent\nspin textures using the traditional semiconductor gate technology.

We\npresent both experiments on the CIFAR-10 dataset to illustrate this principle,\nand a theoretical result proving that for certain natural classification tasks,\ntraining a two-layer neural network with ReLU activation using randomly\ninitialized gradient descent indeed satisfies this principle.\n  Technically, we give, to the best of our knowledge, the first result proving\nthat the following two can hold simultaneously for training a neural network\nwith ReLU activation.

One major but poorly\ninvestigated experimental source of gauge-invariance violation is an imperfect\npreparation of the initial state.

While they are a\npromising source for multimessenger observations as binary AGN, few convincing\ncandidates have been identified in electromagnetic surveys. One approach to\nidentifying candidates has been through spectroscopic surveys searching for\noffsets or time-dependent offsets of broad emission lines (BLs), which may be\ncharacteristic of Doppler shifts from binary orbital motion. In this study, we\npredict the parameter space of MBH binaries that should be kinematically\ndetectable. There is a delicate trade-off between requiring binary separations\nto be large enough for BL regions to remain attached to one of the AGN, but\nalso small enough such that their orbital velocity is detectable. We find that\nkinematic signatures are only observable for the lower-mass secondary AGN, for\nbinaries with total-masses above about $10^8 M_\\odot$, and separations between\n0.1 and 1 pc. We motivate our usage of a kinematic-offset sensitivity of $10^3$\nkm/s, and a sensitivity to changing offsets of $10^2$ km/s. With these\nparameters, and an Eddington ratio of 0.1, we find that 0.5% of binaries have\ndetectable offsets, and only 0.03% have detectable velocity changes. Overall,\nkinematic binary signatures should be expected in fewer than one in $10^4$ AGN.\nBetter characterizing the intrinsic variability of BLs is crucial to\nunderstanding and vetting MBH binary candidates.

We study wind\nrecycling at the halo scale, i.e. gas that has been ejected beyond the halo\nvirial radius, and at the galaxy scale, i.e. gas that has been ejected from the\nISM to at least $\\approx 10 \\, \\%$ of the virial radius (thus excluding\nsmaller-scale galactic fountains). Galaxy-scale wind recycling is generally\ninefficient, with a characteristic return timescale that is comparable or\nlonger than a Hubble time, and with an efficiency that clearly peaks at the\ncharacteristic halo mass of $M_{200} = 10^{12} \\, \\mathrm{M_\\odot}$.\nCorrespondingly, the majority of gas being accreted onto galaxies in EAGLE is\ninfalling for the first time. At the halo scale, the efficiency of recycling\nonto haloes differs by orders of magnitude from values assumed by semi-analytic\ngalaxy formation models. Differences in the efficiency of wind recycling with\nother hydrodynamical simulations are currently difficult to assess, but are\nlikely smaller. We are able to show that the fractional contribution of wind\nrecycling to galaxy growth is smaller in EAGLE than in some other simulations.\nWe find that cumulative first-time gas accretion rates at the virial radius are\nreduced relative to the expectation from dark matter accretion for haloes with\nmass, $M_{200} < 10^{12} \\, \\mathrm{M_\\odot}$, indicating efficient\npreventative feedback on halo scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 May 2020 18:00:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 7 Aug 2020 12:00:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-12"}

The X-ray data reveals three subclusters: (i) the\n`main cluster'; (ii) the remnant of an older merger in the east of the cluster\nwith a ~ 600 kpc long tail; (iii) a bright, bullet-like, low-entropy infalling\nsystem, with a large line-of-sight velocity component. The low-entropy system\ndisplays a 250 kpc long cold front with a break and an intriguing surface\nbrightness decrement. Interestingly, the infalling gas is not co-spatial with\nbright galaxies and the radio loud brightest cluster galaxy of the infalling\ngroup appears dissociated from the low entropy plasma by 50 kpc in projection,\nto the south of the eastern edge of the cold front. Assuming that the dark\nmatter follows the galaxy distribution, we predict that it is also\nsignificantly offset from the low-entropy gas. Part of the low frequency radio\nemission near the cold front might be revived by magnetic field amplification\ndue to differential gas motions. Using analytical models and numerical\nsimulations, we investigate the possibility that the supersonic infall of the\nsubcluster generates a large scale shock along our line-of-sight, which can be\ndetected in the X-ray temperature map but is not associated with any clear\nfeatures in the surface brightness distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 May 2020 18:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-10"}

Here we develop a theory of symmetry-protected quantized\ninvariants for topological phases defined on a lattice, where quantized\ninvariants with no continuum analog can arise. We develop topological field\ntheories using discrete crystalline gauge fields to fully characterize\nquantized invariants of (2+1)D Abelian topological orders with symmetry group\n$G = U(1) \\times G_{\\text{space}}$, where $G_{\\text{space}}$ consists of\norientation-preserving space group symmetries on the lattice. We show how\ndiscrete rotational and translational symmetry fractionalization can be\ncharacterized by a discrete spin vector, a discrete torsion vector which has no\nanalog in the continuum or in the absence of lattice rotation symmetry, and an\narea vector, which also has no analog in the continuum. The discrete torsion\nvector implies a type of crystal momentum fractionalization that is only\nnon-trivial for $2$, $3$, and $4$-fold rotation symmetry.

The primary challenge to detecting this\nsignal is the overwhelmingly bright foreground emission at these frequencies,\nplacing stringent requirements on the knowledge of the instruments and\ninaccuracies in analyses. Results from these experiments have largely been\nlimited not by thermal sensitivity but by systematics, particularly caused by\nthe inability to calibrate the instrument to high accuracy. The interferometric\nbispectrum phase is immune to antenna-based calibration and errors therein, and\npresents an independent alternative to detect the EoR HI fluctuations while\nlargely avoiding calibration systematics.

We argue that the evidence\ncorroborates the inadequacy of MAP decoding more than casts doubt on the model\nand its training algorithm. In this work, we show that translation\ndistributions do reproduce various statistics of the data well, but that beam\nsearch strays from such statistics. We show that some of the known pathologies\nand biases of NMT are due to MAP decoding and not to NMT's statistical\nassumptions nor MLE.

Recently, PPML has seen a visible shift towards the\nadoption of the Secure Outsourced Computation~(SOC) paradigm due to the heavy\ncomputation that it entails. In the SOC paradigm, computation is outsourced to\na set of powerful and specially equipped servers that provide service on a\npay-per-use basis. In this work, we propose SWIFT, a robust PPML framework for\na range of ML algorithms in SOC setting, that guarantees output delivery to the\nusers irrespective of any adversarial behaviour. Robustness, a highly desirable\nfeature, evokes user participation without the fear of denial of service.\n  At the heart of our framework lies a highly-efficient, maliciously-secure,\nthree-party computation (3PC) over rings that provides guaranteed output\ndelivery (GOD) in the honest-majority setting. To the best of our knowledge,\nSWIFT is the first robust and efficient PPML framework in the 3PC setting.\nSWIFT is as fast as (and is strictly better in some cases than) the best-known\n3PC framework BLAZE (Patra et al. NDSS'20), which only achieves fairness. We\nextend our 3PC framework for four parties (4PC). In this regime, SWIFT is as\nfast as the best known fair 4PC framework Trident (Chaudhari et al. NDSS'20)\nand twice faster than the best-known robust 4PC framework FLASH (Byali et al.\nPETS'20).\n  We demonstrate our framework's practical relevance by benchmarking popular ML\nalgorithms such as Logistic Regression and deep Neural Networks such as VGG16\nand LeNet, both over a 64-bit ring in a WAN setting. For deep NN, our results\ntestify to our claims that we provide improved security guarantee while\nincurring no additional overhead for 3PC and obtaining 2x improvement for 4PC.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 May 2020 18:20:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2020 08:26:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 17 Feb 2021 08:47:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-18"}

The plasma channel formation and charge production process in the\nvoltage rising stage are studied at different slopes using a classical 2D fluid\nmodel, the thrust generated in the voltage decaying stage is studied based on\nan analytical approach taking 2D model results as the input. A thrust pulse is\ngenerated in the trailing edge of the voltage waveform and reaches maximum when\nthe voltage decreases by approximately the value of cathode voltage\nfall~($\\approx$600~V). The time duration of the rising and trailing edge, the\ndecay rate and the amplitude of applied voltage are the main factors affecting\nthe performance of the actuator. Analytical expressions are formulated for the\nvalue and time moment of peak thrust, the upper limit of thrust is also\nestimated. Higher voltage rising rate leads to higher charge density in the\nvoltage rising stage thus higher thrust. Shorter voltage trailing edge, in\ngeneral, results in higher value and earlier appearance of the peak thrust. The\ndetailed profile of the trailing edge also affects the performance.

The approach uses a unique\norganization of batch optimization engines to enable a highly efficient\ntwo-tier optimization structure. Tier I consist of agents that create and\npotentially share local maplets (local maps, limited in size) which are\ngenerated using Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) map-building\nsoftware and then marginalized to a more compact parameterization. Maplets are\ngenerated in an overlapping manner and used to estimate the transform and\nuncertainty between those overlapping maplets, providing accurate and compact\nodometry or delta-pose representation between maplet's local frames. The delta\nposes can be shared between agents, and in cases where maplets have salient\nfeatures (for loop closures), the compact representation of the maplet can also\nbe shared.\n  The second optimization tier consists of a global optimizer that seeks to\noptimize those maplet-to-maplet transformations, including any loop closures\nidentified. This can provide an accurate global \"skeleton\"' of the traversed\nspace without operating on the high-density point cloud. This compact version\nof the map data allows for scalable, cooperative exploration with limited\ncommunication requirements where most of the individual maplets, or low\nfidelity renderings, are only shared if desired.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 May 2020 18:49:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-22"}

Detecting and characterizing substellar companions for which the\nluminosity, mass, and age can be determined independently is of utter\nimportance to test and calibrate the evolutionary models due to uncertainties\nin their formation mechanisms. HD 19467 is a bright and nearby star hosting a\ncool brown dwarf companion detected with RV and imaging, making it a valuable\nobject for such studies. Aims. We aim to further characterize the orbital,\nspectral, and physical properties of the HD 19467 system. Methods. We present\nnew high-contrast imaging data with the SPHERE and NaCo instruments. We also\nanalyze archival data from HARPS, NaCo, HIRES, UVES, and ASAS. We also use\nproper motion data of the star from Hipparcos and Gaia. Results. We refine the\nproperties of the host star and derive an age of 8.0$^{+2.0}_{-1.0}$ Gyr based\non isochrones, gyrochronology, and chemical and kinematic arguments. This\nestimate is slightly younger than previous estimates of ~9-11 Gyr. No orbital\ncurvature is seen in the current imaging, RV, and astrometric data. From a\njoint fit of the data, we refine the orbital parameters for HD 19467B: period\n398$^{+95}_{-93}$ yr, inclination 129.8$^{+8.1}_{-5.1}$ deg, eccentricity\n0.56$\\pm$0.09, longitude of the ascending node 134.8$\\pm$4.5 deg, and argument\nof the periastron 64.2$^{+5.5}_{-6.3}$ deg. We assess a dynamical mass of\n74$^{+12}_{-9}$ MJ. The fit with atmospheric models of the spectrophotometric\ndata of HD 19467B indicates an atmosphere without clouds or with very thin\nclouds, an effective temperature of 1042$^{+77}_{-71}$ K, and a large surface\ngravity of 5.34$^{+0.08}_{-0.09}$ dex. The comparison to model predictions of\nthe bolometric luminosity and dynamical mass of HD 19467B, assuming our system\nage estimate, indicates a better agreement with the Burrows et al. models;\nwhereas the other evolutionary models used tend to underestimate its cooling\nrate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 May 2020 18:51:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Jun 2020 17:19:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-08"}

From general conservation laws, we derive the\nequation of motion for each fluid element along this surface, taking into\naccount the deceleration along the surface normal due to newly swept-up mass\nand lateral expansion due to pressure gradient in the tangential direction. The\npressure and energy density of the shocked CSM are given by the jump conditions\nat the forward shock.

For many cancer types, the scarceness of data creates\nbarriers for training DL models.

Importantly, we adopt a\nbottom-up approach for discovering a large vocabulary of 833 categories, an\norder of magnitude more than prior tracking benchmarks. To this end, we ask\nannotators to label objects that move at any point in the video, and give names\nto them post factum.

To ensure scalability\nof annotation, we employ a federated approach that focuses manual effort on\nlabeling tracks for those relevant objects in a video (e.g., those that move).\nWe perform an extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art trackers and make a\nnumber of important discoveries regarding large-vocabulary tracking in an\nopen-world.

A steady\nbarotropic vortex dipole is first considered. Nearly monochromatic shear bands\nappear in the jet region as wave energy propagate downwards and towards\nanticyclone. As a result of refraction, both horizontal and vertical\nwavenumbers grow linearly with the time $t$ elapsed since generation such that\ntheir ratio, the slope of wave bands, is time-indepedent. Analogy with passive\nscalar dynamics suggests that strain should result in the exponential growth of\n$|\\boldsymbol{k}|$. Here instead, strain is ineffective not only at the jet\ncenter, but also at its confluent and diffluent regions. Low modes rapidly\nescape below the anticyclonic core such that the weakly-dispersive high modes\nare dominant in the mixed layer. In the weakly-dispersive limit,\n$\\boldsymbol{k}=- t \\nabla \\zeta(x,y,t)/2$ provided that (i) the eddy vertical\nvorticity $\\zeta$ evolves according to the barotropic quasi-geostrophic\nequation; and (ii) $\\boldsymbol{k}=0$ initially, as is typically assumed for\nnear-inertial waves generated by large-scale atmospheric storms. In steady\nflows, strain is ineffective because $\\boldsymbol{k}$ is always perpendicular\nto the flow. In unsteady flows, straining modifies the vorticity gradient and\nhence $\\boldsymbol{k}$, and may account for significant energy transfers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 May 2020 21:24:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-30"}

Many theories have\nbeen proposed to reconcile the violation of Bell's inequalities with Local\nRealism, but none has been fully successful. In this paper, it is recalled that\nany theory aimed to violate Bell's inequalities must start by giving up Boolean\nlogic. The problem is split in two: the \"soft\" problem is to explain the\nviolation of Bell's inequalities within (non-Boolean) Local Realism. The \"hard\"\nproblem is to predict the time values when single particles are detected. A\nsimple hidden variables model is introduced, which solves the soft problem.\nThis is possible thanks to the use of vectors as the hidden variables and the\noperation projection, which do not hold to Boolean logic. This model reconciles\nthe violation of Bell's inequalities with Local Realism and should end decades\nof controversy.

They are\nusually unpredictable, fast in development, and extend across large\ngeographical areas. The consequences of such disasters can be reduced through\nbetter monitoring, for example using mobile sensing platforms that can give\ntimely and accurate information to first responders and the public. Given the\nextended scale of the areas to monitor, and the time-varying nature of the\nphenomenon, we need fast algorithms to quickly determine the best sequence of\nlocations to be monitored. This problem is very challenging: the present\ninformative mobile sensor routing algorithms are either short-sighted or\ncomputationally demanding when applied to large scale systems. In this paper, a\nreal-time sensor task scheduling algorithm that suits the features and needs of\ncity-scale environmental monitoring tasks is proposed. The algorithm is run in\nforward search and makes use of the predictions of an associated distributed\nparameter system, modeling flash flood propagation. It partly inherits the\ncausal relation expressed by a search tree, which describes all possible\nsequential decisions. The computationally heavy data assimilation steps in the\nforward search tree are replaced by functions dependent on the covariance\nmatrix between observation sets. Taking flood tracking in an urban area as a\nconcrete example, numerical experiments in this paper indicate that this\nscheduling algorithm can achieve better results than myopic planning algorithms\nand other heuristics based sensor placement algorithms. Furthermore, this paper\nrelies on a deep learning-based data-driven model to track the system states,\nand experiments suggest that popular estimation techniques have very good\nperformance when applied to precise data-driven models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 May 2020 22:24:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-30"}

The corresponding effective field theory is a double-frequency\nsine-Gordon (DSG) model which involves two perturbations at the Gaussian fixed\npoint: the deviation from criticality and Umklapp scattering processes. A\ntopological distinction between thermodynamically equivalent phases becomes\nonly feasible when nonlocal fermionic fields, parity and string order\nparameter, are included into consideration. We prove that a noninteracting\nfermionic staggered SSH ladder is exactly equivalent to a O(2)-symmetric model\nof two decoupled Kitaev-Majorana chains, or two 1D p-wave superconductors.\nClose to the Gaussian fixed point the SSH ladder maps to an Ashkin-Teller like\nsystem when interactions are included. Thus, the topological order in the SSH\nladder is related to broken-symmetry phases of the associated quantum\nspin-chain degrees of freedom. The obtained phase diagram includes a\nTomonaga-Luttinger liquid state which, due to Umklapp processes, can become\nunstable against either spontaneous dimerization or the onset of a\ncharge-density wave (CDW). In these gapped phases elementary bulk excitations\nare quantum kinks carrying the charge QF = 1/2. For sufficiently strong,\nlong-range interactions, the phase diagram of the model exhibits a bifurcation\nof the Gaussian critical point into two outgoing Ising criticalities. The\nlatter sandwich a mixed phase in which dimerization coexists with a\nsite-diagonal CDW. In this phase elementary bulk excitations are represented by\ntwo types of topological solitons carrying different fermionic charges, which\ncontinuously interpolate between 0 and 1. This phase has also mixed topological\nproperties with coexisting parity and string order parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 May 2020 22:48:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Jun 2020 18:06:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}

These approximations can\nbe introduced at three different levels: in the form of the likelihood, in the\ntheoretical modelling of the observable and in the numerical computation of the\nobservable. Their consequences are important both in data analysis through\ne.g., Markov Chain Monte Carlo parameter inference, and when survey instrument\nand strategy are designed and their constraining power on cosmological\nparameters is forecasted, for instance using Fisher matrix analyses. In this\nwork, considering the galaxy angular power spectrum as the target observable,\nwe report one example of approximation for each of such three categories:\nneglecting off-diagonal terms in the covariance matrix, neglecting cosmic\nmagnification and using the Limber approximation on large scales. We show that\nthese commonly used approximations affect the robustness of the analysis and\nlead, perhaps counter-intuitively, to unacceptably large mis-estimates of\nparameters errors (from few~$10\\%$ up to few~$100\\%$) and correlations.\nFurthermore, these approximations might even spoil the benefits of the nascent\nmulti-tracer and multi-messenger cosmology.

The study of their local stability\nhas been proposed through the so-called performance regimes: maximum power\noutput, maximum ecological function, among others. Recently, the global\nstability analysis of an endoreversible heat engine was also studied taking\ninto account the same performance regimes. We present a study of local and\nglobal stability analysis of power plant models (the Curzon-Ahlborn model)\noperating on a generalized efficient power regime called maximum k-efficient\npower. We apply the Lyapunov stability theory to construct the Lyapunov\nfunctions to prove the asymptotically stable behavior of the steady-state of\nintermediate temperatures in the Curzon-Ahlborn model. We consider the effect\nof a linear heat transfer law on the phase portrait description of real power\nplants, as well as the role of the $k$ parameter in the evolution of\nperturbations to heat flow. In general, restructured operation conditions show\nbetter stability in external perturbations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 May 2020 23:45:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-17"}

The ALMA data show well organized electric field\norientations in most of the nebula and the inferred magnetic field vectors\n(rotated by 90 degrees) trace an hourglass morphology centred on the central\nsystem of the nebula.

The responsiveness of the agent is\nlargely governed by latency of its processing pipeline. While past work has\nstudied the algorithmic trade-off between latency and accuracy, there has not\nbeen a clear metric to compare different methods along the Pareto optimal\nlatency-accuracy curve. We point out a discrepancy between standard offline\nevaluation and real-time applications: by the time an algorithm finishes\nprocessing a particular frame, the surrounding world has changed. To these\nends, we present an approach that coherently integrates latency and accuracy\ninto a single metric for real-time online perception, which we refer to as\n\"streaming accuracy\". The key insight behind this metric is to jointly evaluate\nthe output of the entire perception stack at every time instant, forcing the\nstack to consider the amount of streaming data that should be ignored while\ncomputation is occurring. More broadly, building upon this metric, we introduce\na meta-benchmark that systematically converts any single-frame task into a\nstreaming perception task. We focus on the illustrative tasks of object\ndetection and instance segmentation in urban video streams, and contribute a\nnovel dataset with high-quality and temporally-dense annotations. Our proposed\nsolutions and their empirical analysis demonstrate a number of surprising\nconclusions: (1) there exists an optimal \"sweet spot\" that maximizes streaming\naccuracy along the Pareto optimal latency-accuracy curve, (2) asynchronous\ntracking and future forecasting naturally emerge as internal representations\nthat enable streaming perception, and (3) dynamic scheduling can be used to\novercome temporal aliasing, yielding the paradoxical result that latency is\nsometimes minimized by sitting idle and \"doing nothing\".\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 May 2020 01:51:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 25 Aug 2020 01:16:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

In this paper, we tackle the challenging task of\nprostate segmentation in CT images by a two-stage network with 1) the first\nstage to fast localize, and 2) the second stage to accurately segment the\nprostate. To precisely segment the prostate in the second stage, we formulate\nprostate segmentation into a multi-task learning framework, which includes a\nmain task to segment the prostate, and an auxiliary task to delineate the\nprostate boundary. Here, the second task is applied to provide additional\nguidance of unclear prostate boundary in CT images. Besides, the conventional\nmulti-task deep networks typically share most of the parameters (i.e., feature\nrepresentations) across all tasks, which may limit their data fitting ability,\nas the specificities of different tasks are inevitably ignored. By contrast, we\nsolve them by a hierarchically-fused U-Net structure, namely HF-UNet. The\nHF-UNet has two complementary branches for two tasks, with the novel proposed\nattention-based task consistency learning block to communicate at each level\nbetween the two decoding branches. Therefore, HF-UNet endows the ability to\nlearn hierarchically the shared representations for different tasks, and\npreserve the specificities of learned representations for different tasks\nsimultaneously. We did extensive evaluations of the proposed method on a large\nplanning CT image dataset, including images acquired from 339 patients.

However, if data with\ncharacteristics that differ from the existing data is input, the model does not\nalways behave as expected. Accordingly, to confirm the behavior of the model\nmore strictly, it is necessary to create data that differs from the existing\ndata and test the model with that different data. The data to be tested\nincludes not only data that developers can suppose (supposable data) but also\ndata they cannot suppose (unsupposable data). To confirm the behavior of the\nmodel strictly, it is important to create as much unsupposable data as\npossible. In this study, therefore, a method called \"unsupposable test-data\ngeneration\" (UTG)---for giving suggestions for unsupposable data to model\ndevelopers and testers---is proposed. UTG uses a variational autoencoder (VAE)\nto generate unsupposable data. The unsupposable data is generated by acquiring\nlatent values with low occurrence probability in the prior distribution of the\nVAE and inputting the acquired latent values into the decoder. If unsupposable\ndata is included in the data generated by the decoder, the developer can\nrecognize new unsupposable features by referring to the data.

Therefore, various pruning methods have been\ndeveloped to compress the deep network architectures and accelerate the\ninference process. Most of the existing channel pruning methods discard the\nless important filters according to well-designed filter ranking criteria.\nHowever, due to the limited interpretability of deep learning models, designing\nan appropriate ranking criterion to distinguish redundant filters is difficult.\nTo address such a challenging issue, we propose a new technique of Channel\nPruning via Optimal Transport, dubbed CPOT. Specifically, we locate the\nWasserstein barycenter for channels of each layer in the deep models, which is\nthe mean of a set of probability distributions under the optimal transport\nmetric. Then, we prune the redundant information located by Wasserstein\nbarycenters. At last, we empirically demonstrate that, for classification\ntasks, CPOT outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on pruning ResNet-20,\nResNet-32, ResNet-56, and ResNet-110. Furthermore, we show that the proposed\nCPOT technique is good at compressing the StarGAN models by pruning in the more\ndifficult case of image-to-image translation tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 May 2020 03:43:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-22"}

As the wave speed of GWs is closely related\nto the locality and wavefront geometry of GWs, which are inherently difficult\nto be addressed in the frequency-domain, our analyses in the time-domain,\ntherefore, provide the first robust analyses to date on this issue based on\nsolid physics. Moreover, we also investigate, for the first time, the\ninterference between the incident and the scattered waves (the \"echoes\" of the\nincident waves). We find that such interference makes the total lensed\nwaveforms dramatically different from those of the original incident ones not\nonly in the amplitude but also in the phase and pattern, especially for signals\nnear the merger of the two back holes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 May 2020 06:57:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-22"}

Biometric information delivered\nto untrusted third-party servers in an uncontrolled manner can be considered a\nsignificant privacy leak (i.e. uncontrolled information release) as biometrics\ncan be correlated with sensitive data such as healthcare or financial records.\nIn this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving technique for \"controlled\ninformation release\", where we disguise an original face image and prevent\nleakage of the biometric features while identifying a person. We introduce a\nnew privacy-preserving face recognition protocol named PEEP (Privacy using\nEigEnface Perturbation) that utilizes local differential privacy. PEEP applies\nperturbation to Eigenfaces utilizing differential privacy and stores only the\nperturbed data in the third-party servers to run a standard Eigenface\nrecognition algorithm. As a result, the trained model will not be vulnerable to\nprivacy attacks such as membership inference and model memorization attacks.\nOur experiments show that PEEP exhibits a classification accuracy of around 70%\n- 90% under standard privacy settings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 May 2020 06:59:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 4 Jul 2020 14:04:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-07"}

The (by now common) multivariate unsupervised\nlinear unmixing methods and their nonlinear analogs generally explore\nsimilarities in the energy dimension but ignore correlations in the spatial\ndomain. At the same time, Gaussian process (GP) methods that explicitly\nincorporate spatial correlations in the form of kernel functions tend to be\nextremely computationally intensive, while the use of inducing point-based\nsparse methods often leads to reconstruction artefacts. Here, we suggest and\nimplement a parallel GP method operating on the full spatial domain and reduced\nrepresentations in the energy domain. In this parallel GP, the information\nbetween the components is shared via a common spatial kernel structure while\nallowing for variability in the relative noise magnitude or image morphology.\nWe explore the role of common spatial structures and kernel constraints on the\nquality of the reconstruction and suggest an approach for estimating these\nfactors from the experimental data. Application of this method to an example\nEELS dataset demonstrates that spatial information contained in higher-order\ncomponents can be reconstructed and spatially localized.

This is because most\nlearning algorithms operate with the features in order to find models for the\ndata. For instance, classification performance can improve if the data is\nmapped to a space where classes are easily separated, and regression can be\nfacilitated by finding a manifold of data in the feature space. As a general\nrule, features are transformed by means of statistical methods such as\nprincipal component analysis, or manifold learning techniques such as Isomap or\nlocally linear embedding. From a plethora of representation learning methods,\none of the most versatile tools is the autoencoder. In this paper we aim to\ndemonstrate how to influence its learned representations to achieve the desired\nlearning behavior.

To reduce HPO time,\nwe present HyperSTAR (System for Task Aware Hyperparameter Recommendation), a\ntask-aware method to warm-start HPO for deep neural networks. HyperSTAR ranks\nand recommends hyperparameters by predicting their performance conditioned on a\njoint dataset-hyperparameter space. It learns a dataset (task) representation\nalong with the performance predictor directly from raw images in an end-to-end\nfashion. The recommendations, when integrated with an existing HPO method, make\nit task-aware and significantly reduce the time to achieve optimal performance.\nWe conduct extensive experiments on 10 publicly available large-scale image\nclassification datasets over two different network architectures, validating\nthat HyperSTAR evaluates 50% less configurations to achieve the best\nperformance compared to existing methods.

These ameliorations\npertain to the azimuthal processing of radar data with linear or quasi-linear\nantenna arrays. The first idea is to take advantage of the remote transmitter\nto perform an automatic correction of the complex gains of the receiving\nantennas based on the analysis of the signal received in the direct path. This\ndirect signal can be found at the zero-Doppler and minimal range cell in the\nRange-Doppler representation. We term this adjustment as \"self-calibration\" of\nthe receiving array, as it can be performed in real-time without any specific\naction from the operator. The second idea consists in applying a Direction\nFinding technique (instead of traditional Beam Forming) not only to the full\narray of antenna but also to subarrays made of a smaller number of sequential\nantennas, a method which we refer to as \"antenna grouping\". The combination of\nself-calibration and antenna grouping makes it possible to obtain\nhigh-resolution maps with full coverage, thereby combining the respective\nmerits of Direction Finding and Beam Forming techniques. In addition the method\nis found robust to missing antennas in the array. These techniques are applied\nto and illustrated with the multistatic High-Frequency Radar network in Toulon.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 May 2020 09:05:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-22"}

Existing\ntheories of flux emergence suggest that the magnetic flux can rise buoyantly\nthrough the convection zone but is trapped at the photosphere, while its\nfurther rising into the atmosphere resorts to the Parker buoyancy instability.\nTo trigger such an instability, the Lorentz force in the photosphere needs to\nbe as large as the gas pressure gradient to hold up an extra amount of mass\nagainst gravity. This naturally results in a strongly non-force-free\nphotosphere, which is indeed shown in typical idealized numerical simulations\nof flux tube buoyancy from below the photosphere into the corona. Here we\nconduct a statistical study of the extents of normalized Lorentz forces and\ntorques in the emerging photospheric magnetic field with a substantially large\nsample of SDO/HMI vector magnetograms. We found that the photospheric field has\na rather small Lorentz force and torque on average, and thus is very close to a\nforce-free state, which is not consistent with theories as well as idealized\nsimulations of flux emergence. Furthermore, the small extents of forces and\ntorques seem not to be influenced by the emerging AR's size, the emergence\nrate, or the non-potentiality of the field. This result puts an important\nconstraint on future development of theories and simulations of flux emergence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 May 2020 09:18:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-17"}

Exploring the\npresent uncertainty on the empirical parameters of nuclear matter and the\nparameter space of the NJL model, we construct two datasets of\nthermodynamically consistent and causal hybrid EoSs, compatible with\nastrophysical observations. We conclude that, to sustain a considerable quark\ncore size, the intensity of the phase transition from hadron to quark matter\ncannot be strong, having a energy density gap below $200$ MeV/fm$^3$, and must\noccur at baryon densities not above four times the saturation density. A non\nzero but not too strong quark vector-isoscalar term and a weak vector isovector\nquark term are required.

Learning an\nimproved tilt update policy is hard. On the one hand, coming up with a new\npolicy in an online manner in a real network requires exploring tilt updates\nthat have never been used before, and is operationally too risky. On the other\nhand, devising this policy via simulations suffers from the\nsimulation-to-reality gap. In this paper, we circumvent these issues by\nlearning an improved policy in an offline manner using existing data collected\non real networks.

Standard models for production functions are not adequate to\nmodel the short-term effects of lockdown. A survey of industry analysts\nconducted by IHS Markit allows us to evaluate which inputs for each industry\nare absolutely necessary for production over a two month period.

In this\npaper we show that the convergence rate of SGD approaches with IPS-weighted\ngradients suffers from the large variance introduced by the IPS weights:\nconvergence is slow, especially when there are large IPS weights. To overcome\nthis limitation, we propose a novel learning algorithm, called CounterSample,\nthat has provably better convergence than standard IPS-weighted gradient\ndescent methods.

The achievable\nperformance of RIS relies on the availability of accurate channel state\ninformation (CSI), which however is generally difficult to be obtained.

However, the way aggression diffuses in the network has received\nlittle attention as it embeds modeling challenges. In fact, modeling how\naggression propagates from one user to another, is an important research topic\nsince it can enable effective aggression monitoring, especially in media\nplatforms which up to now apply simplistic user blocking techniques. In this\npaper, we address aggression propagation modeling and minimization on Twitter,\nsince it is a popular microblogging platform at which aggression had several\nonsets. We propose various methods building on two well-known diffusion models,\nIndependent Cascade (IC) and Linear Threshold (LT), to study the aggression\nevolution in the social network. We experimentally investigate how well each\nmethod can model aggression propagation using real Twitter data, while varying\nparameters, such as seed users selection, graph edge weighting, users'\nactivation timing, etc. It is found that the best performing strategies are the\nones to select seed users with a degree-based approach, weigh user edges based\non their social circles' overlaps, and activate users according to their\naggression levels.

To validate this technique, we developed and verified a\nlocking insertion flow, analyzed PPA and ATPG overhead on benchmark circuits\nand industry cores, extended existing attacks to account for the technique, and\ntaped out a demonstration chip. Importantly, we show that the design overhead\nwith this approach is significantly less than with previous logic locking\nschemes, while resisting model checker-based, oracle-driven attacks.

The latter is\ncustomarily fixed to the FIRAS best-fit value in CMB data analyses. Although\nthis value was confirmed by several independent experiments, it is interesting\nto see how much parameter constraints depend on this prior. We first provide a\ndetailed pedagogical description of the $T_0$ effects on cosmological\nobservables. We show that the recombination history and transfer functions do\nnot depend on $T_0$, provided they are parametrized by the energy scale rather\nthan redshift, and at fixed dark matter and baryon densities per CMB photon.\nThus, $T_0$ is only a property of the observer, quantifying the amount of\nexpansion between key cosmological events and today. As a consequence, the sole\neffect of $T_0$ on small-scale primary CMB anisotropies is through the angular\ndiameter distance to the epoch of last scattering, resulting in a near-perfect\ndegeneracy between $T_0$ and $H_0$. This geometric degeneracy is partially\nlifted by the late-time integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect and CMB lensing. Still,\nPlanck data alone is consistent with a broad region in the $H_0-T_0$ plane,\nimplying that removing the FIRAS prior on $T_0$ can make Planck and SH0ES less\ndiscrepant, without introducing new physics beyond $\\Lambda$CDM. One may break\nthe degeneracy by combining Planck with SH0ES, yielding an independent\nmeasurement of $T_0$, which happens to be in $3\\sigma$ tension with FIRAS.\nTherefore, the Hubble tension indeed can be recast into the $T_0$ tension. The\nagreement with FIRAS is restored when combining Planck with the baryon acoustic\noscillation data instead of SH0ES. Thus, the tension between SH0ES and\ncosmological measurements of $H_0$ persists even if we discard the FIRAS $T_0$\nprior.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 May 2020 14:02:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 9 Jul 2020 16:53:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-23"}

To obtain this\nresult, we prove that the intersection of two $2$-maximal submonoids is either\nthe empty word or a submonoid generated by one single primitive word. For a\nsingle word $w$, we say that the set $\\{x,y\\}$ is a {\\em bi-root} of $w$ if $w$\ncan be written as a concatenation of copies of $x$ and $y$ and $\\{x,y\\}$ is a\nprimitive set. We prove that every primitive word $w$ has at most one bi-root\n$\\{x,y\\}$ such that $|x|+|y|<\\sqrt{|w|}$. That is, the bi-root of a word is\nunique provided the word is sufficiently long with respect to the size (sum of\nlengths) of the root. Our results are also compared to previous approaches that\ninvestigate pseudo-repetitions, where a morphic involutive function $\\theta$ is\ndefined on $A^*$. In this setting, the notions of $\\theta$-power,\n$\\theta$-primitive and $\\theta$-root are defined, and it is shown that any word\nhas a unique $\\theta$-primitive root. This result can be obtained with our\napproach by showing that a word $w$ is $\\theta$-primitive if and only if $\\{w,\n\\theta(w)\\}$ is a primitive set.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 20 May 2020 16:14:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-22"}

We propose an\napproach for ahead-of-time domain specific optimization of CNN models, based on\nan integer linear programming (ILP) for selecting primitive operations to\nimplement convolutional layers. We optimize the trade-off between execution\ntime and memory consumption by: 1) attempting to minimize execution time across\nthe whole network by selecting data layouts and primitive operations to\nimplement each layer; and 2) allocating an appropriate workspace that reflects\nthe upper bound of memory footprint per layer. These two optimization\nstrategies can be used to run any CNN on any platform with a C compiler. Our\nevaluation with a range of popular ImageNet neural architectures (GoogleNet,\nAlexNet, VGG, ResNet and SqueezeNet) on the ARM Cortex-A15 yields speedups of\n8x compared to a greedy algorithm based primitive selection, reduces memory\nrequirement by 2.2x while sacrificing only 15% of inference time compared to a\nsolver that considers inference time only.

To ensure completion of such tasks, platforms frequently use a lever\nknown as \"adoption,\" which amounts to a commitment by the volunteer to\nrepeatedly perform the task. Despite reducing match uncertainty, high levels of\nadoption can decrease the probability of forming new matches, which in turn can\nsuppress growth. We study how platforms should manage this trade-off. Our\nresearch is motivated by a collaboration with Food Rescue U.S. (FRUS), a\nvolunteer-based food recovery organization active in over 30 locations. For\nplatforms such as FRUS, success crucially depends on volunteer engagement.\nConsequently, effectively utilizing non-monetary levers, such as adoption, is\ncritical. Motivated by the volunteer management literature and our analysis of\nFRUS data, we develop a model for two-sided markets which repeatedly match\nvolunteers with tasks. Our model incorporates match uncertainty as well as the\nnegative impact of failing to match on future engagement. We study the\nplatform's optimal policy for setting the adoption level to maximize the total\ndiscounted number of matches. We fully characterize the optimal myopic policy\nand show that it takes a simple form: depending on volunteer characteristics\nand market thickness, either allow for full adoption or disallow adoption. In\nthe long run, we show that such a policy is either optimal or achieves a\nconstant-factor approximation. Our finding is robust to incorporating\nheterogeneity in volunteer behavior. Our work sheds light on how two-sided\nplatforms need to carefully control the double-edged impacts that commitment\nlevers have on growth and engagement.

Yet,\nit is conceivable that if the basic mechanisms of growth and the coupled\nkinetic laws that orchestrate their function are accounted for, a minimal\ntheoretical model may exhibit similar growth behaviors. The ubiquity of surface\ngrowth, a mechanism by which material is added or removed on the boundaries of\nthe body, has motivated the development of theoretical models, which can\ncapture the diffusion-coupled kinetics that govern it. However, due to their\ncomplexity, application of these models has been limited to simplified\ngeometries.

Rule-based approaches\nprescribe the adaptation to be executed if the system or environment satisfies\ncertain conditions. They result in scalable solutions but often with merely\nsatisfying adaptation decisions. In contrast, utility-driven approaches\ndetermine optimal decisions by using an often costly optimization, which\ntypically does not scale for large problems. We propose a rule-based and\nutility-driven adaptation scheme that achieves the benefits of both directions\nsuch that the adaptation decisions are optimal, whereas the computation scales\nby avoiding an expensive optimization. We use this adaptation scheme for\narchitecture-based self-healing of large software systems.

Moreover, we use\npattern-based adaptation rules to resolve these issues. Using a pattern-based\nscheme to define the utility and adaptation rules allows us to compute the\nimpact of each rule application on the overall utility and to realize an\nincremental and efficient utility-driven self-healing. In addition to formally\nanalyzing the computational effort and optimality of the proposed scheme, we\nthoroughly demonstrate its scalability and optimality in terms of reward in\ncomparative experiments with a static rule-based approach as a baseline and a\nutility-driven approach using a constraint solver.

As a proof of concept, we apply these tools to the\nnon-central matrix-variate Gamma (nc-mv-Gamma) distribution, whose covariance\ntensor was so far unknown, and design a new signal representation capturing\nintra-voxel heterogeneity via a single nc-mv-Gamma distribution: the\nmatrix-variate Gamma approximation.

To this\nend, the electrical distance of agents is considered in the pricing mechanism\nto encourage agents to trade with their neighboring agents. In addition, a\nreputation factor is considered for each agent, reflecting its past performance\nin delivering the committed energy. Before starting the negotiation, agents\nselect their trading partners based on their preferences over the reputation\nand proximity of the trading partners. An Anonymous Proof of Location (A-PoL)\nalgorithm is proposed that allows agents to prove their location without\nrevealing their real identity. The practicality of the proposed framework is\nillustrated through several case studies, and its security and privacy are\nanalyzed in detail.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 May 2020 06:49:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-01"}

In this paper, we extend\nthis result by proving that, in a broader setting, the Bayes optimal fair\nlearning rule remains a group-wise thresholding rule over the Bayes regressor\nbut with a (possible) randomization at the thresholds. This provides a stronger\njustification to the post-processing approach in fair classification, in which\n(1) a predictor is learned first, after which (2) its output is adjusted to\nremove bias. We show how the post-processing rule in this two-stage approach\ncan be learned quite efficiently by solving an unconstrained optimization\nproblem. The proposed algorithm can be applied to any black-box machine\nlearning model, such as deep neural networks, random forests and support vector\nmachines. In addition, it can accommodate many fairness criteria that have been\npreviously proposed in the literature, such as equalized odds and statistical\nparity. We prove that the algorithm is Bayes consistent and motivate it,\nfurthermore, via an impossibility result that quantifies the tradeoff between\naccuracy and fairness across multiple demographic groups. Finally, we conclude\nby validating the algorithm on the Adult benchmark dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 21 May 2020 11:29:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-01"}

Many efforts have been paid to turn the\nnon-streaming attention-based E2E-ASR system into streaming architecture. In\nthis work, we propose a novel online E2E-ASR system by using Streaming\nChunk-Aware Multihead Attention(SCAMA) and a latency control memory equipped\nself-attention network (LC-SAN-M). LC-SAN-M uses chunk-level input to control\nthe latency of encoder. As to SCAMA, a jointly trained predictor is used to\ncontrol the output of encoder when feeding to decoder, which enables decoder to\ngenerate output in streaming manner. Experimental results on the open 170-hour\nAISHELL-1 and an industrial-level 20000-hour Mandarin speech recognition tasks\nshow that our approach can significantly outperform the MoChA-based baseline\nsystem under comparable setup.

The key improvement introduced by Transformer is\nthe utilization of self-attention instead of recurrent mechanisms, enabling\nboth encoder and decoder to capture long-range dependencies with lower\ncomputational complexity.In this work, we propose boosting the self-attention\nability with a DFSMN memory block, forming the proposed memory equipped\nself-attention (SAN-M) mechanism. Theoretical and empirical comparisons have\nbeen made to demonstrate the relevancy and complementarity between\nself-attention and the DFSMN memory block. Furthermore, the proposed SAN-M\nprovides an efficient mechanism to integrate these two modules. We have\nevaluated our approach on the public AISHELL-1 benchmark and an\nindustrial-level 20,000-hour Mandarin speech recognition task.
