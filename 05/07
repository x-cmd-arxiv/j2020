In the\nfirst stage, a convex second-order cone programming (SOCP)-based ACOPF model is\nproposed in which the detailed models and limitations of DER, namely, demand\nresponse (DR), energy storage units, and rooftop PV systems are modeled to\nobtain participation ratio of DERs. In the second stage, Monte Carlo simulation\nis utilized to model the uncertainties of DERs. A probability violation index\nis introduced to make a trade-off between scheduling more DERs and imposing a\nhigher risk to the distribution system. In this stage, power flow analysis is\nconducted for each scenario to determine the probability violation index of\nsystem. Then, a modified SOCP-based ACOPF is proposed to satisfy the system\nprobability violation criterion.

A superlevel set of this conditional\ndistribution can be interpreted as a set of severe and plausible stress\nscenarios the given capital is supposed to cover.

Among these properties, we find that modality of the\nconditional distribution is an important feature in risk assessment related to\nthe variety of risky scenarios likely to occur in a stressed situation.

In this context, the model involves a representation of a\nportion of reality, based on ontology of different kinds of things and their\nbasic relations to each other.

The breakdown of thermalization may be\ncomplete, when all eigenstates in the many-body spectrum become localized, or\npartial, when the so-called many-body mobility edge separates localized and\ndelocalized parts of the spectrum. Previously, De Roeck \\textit{et\nal.}[arXiv:1506.01505] suggested a possible instability of the many-body\nmobility edge in energy density. The local ergodic regions -- so called\n\"bubbles\" -- resonantly spread throughout the system, leading to\ndelocalization. In order to study such instability mechanism, in this work we\ndesign a model featuring many-body mobility edge in \\emph{particle density}:\nthe states at small particle density are localized, while increasing the\ndensity of particles leads to delocalization. Using numerical simulations with\nmatrix product states we demonstrate the stability of MBL with respect to small\nbubbles in large dilute systems for experimentally relevant timescales. In\naddition, we demonstrate that processes where the bubble spreads are favored\nover processes that lead to resonant tunneling, suggesting a possible mechanism\nbehind the observed stability of many-body mobility edge.

We develop a computational approach to solve the\noptimal information design problem, i.e., to minimize expected social latency\nover all public or obedient private signaling policies. For a fixed flow\ninduced by non-participating agents, design of an optimal private signaling\npolicy is shown to be a generalized problem of moments for polynomial link\nlatency functions, and to admit an atomic solution with a provable upper bound\non the number of atoms. This implies that, for polynomial link latency\nfunctions, information design can be equivalently cast as a polynomial\noptimization problem. This in turn can be arbitrarily lower bounded by a known\nhierarchy of semidefinite relaxations.

The observed N/O ratio,\nhowever, shows large scatter at low O/H, and is strongly dependent on galactic\nenvironment. We show that several heretofore unexplained features of the N/O\ndistribution at low O/H can be explained by the N seen in metal-poor galaxies\nbeing mostly primary nitrogen that is returned to the ISM via pre-supernova\nwinds from rapidly rotating massive stars ($M \\gtrsim 10$ M$_\\odot$, $v/v_{\\rm\ncrit} \\gtrsim 0.4$).

Since the entanglement entropy density does\nnot distinguish these phases, we introduce the entangling power - which\nmeasures whether local measurements outside of two finite subsystems can boost\ntheir mutual information - as an order parameter, after considering its\nbehavior in tensor network states, and numerically studying its behavior in a\nmodel of Clifford dynamics with measurements.

Instead, they employ simple prescriptions to infer their final\nfates without knowing the presupernova core structure. We explore a potential\nsolution to this problem by treating the carbon-oxygen (CO) core independently\nfrom the rest of the star. Using the implicit hydrodynamics code KEPLER, we\nhave computed an extensive grid of 3496 CO-core models from a diverse range of\ninitial conditions, each evolved from carbon ignition until core-collapse.

We focus on the global three-mode parametric\ninstability and show that it has a much lower threshold energy than the local\nwave-breaking condition studied previously. By integrating networks of coupled\nmodes, we calculate the tidal dissipation rate as a function of orbital period.\nWe construct phenomenological models that match these numerical results and use\nthem to evaluate the spin and luminosity evolution of a WD binary. While in\nlinear theory the WD's spin frequency can lock to the orbital frequency, we\nfind that such a lock cannot be maintained when nonlinear effects are taken\ninto account. Instead, as the orbit decays, the spin and orbit go in and out of\nsynchronization. Each time they go out of synchronization, there is a brief but\nsignificant dip in the tidal heating rate. While most WDs in compact binaries\nshould have luminosities that are similar to previous traveling-wave estimates,\na few percent should be about ten times dimmer because they reside in heating\nrate dips. This offers a potential explanation for the low luminosity of the CO\nWD in J0651.

In this work, we propose SnoopDog, a framework\nto not only detect common Wi-Fi-based wireless sensors that are actively\nmonitoring a user, but also classify and localize each device. SnoopDog works\nby establishing causality between patterns in observable wireless traffic and a\ntrusted sensor in the same space, e.g., an inertial measurement unit (IMU) that\ncaptures a user's movement. Once causality is established, SnoopDog performs\npacket inspection to inform the user about the monitoring device. Finally,\nSnoopDog localizes the clandestine device in a 2D plane using a novel\ntrial-based localization technique. We evaluated SnoopDog across several\ndevices and various modalities and were able to detect causality for snooping\ndevices 95.2% of the time and localize devices to a sufficiently reduced\nsub-space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 May 2020 18:41:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 18 Apr 2021 08:22:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-20"}

On the other hand, Multifactorial Optimization (MFO) can\nsimultaneously solve independent optimization problems, which are encoded in a\nunified representation to take advantage of the process of knowledge transfer.\nIn this paper, we introduce Multifactorial Linkage Tree Genetic Algorithm\n(MF-LTGA) by combining the main features of both LTGA and MFO. MF-LTGA is able\nto tackle multiple optimization tasks at the same time, each task learns the\ndependency between problem variables from the shared representation. This\nknowledge serves to determine the high-quality partial solutions for supporting\nother tasks in exploring the search space. Moreover, MF-LTGA speeds up\nconvergence because of knowledge transfer of relevant problems.

Owing to their potential impact on the realisation of\ntwisted spin-textures, their implication in spintronics or quantum computing is\nvery promising. Here, I address the long-range behavior of multi-spin MEI on\nthe basis of a multiple-scattering formalism implementable in Green functions\nbased methods. I consider the impact of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) as described\nin the one- (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) Rashba model, from which the\nanalytical forms of the four- and six-spin interactions are extracted and\ncompared to the bilinear isotropic, anisotropic and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya\ninteractions (DMI). Similarly to the DMI between two sites $i$ and $j$, there\nis a four-spin chiral vector perpendicular to the bond connecting the two\nsites. The oscillatory behavior of the MEI and their decay as function of\ninteratomic distances are analysed and quantified for the Rashba surfaces\nstates characterizing Au surfaces. The interplay of beating effects and\nstrength of SOC gives rise to a wide parameter space where chiral MEI are more\nprominent than the isotropic ones. The multi-spin interactions for a plaquette\nof $N$ magnetic moments decay like $\\{q_F^{N-d} P^{\\frac{1}{2}(d-1)}L\\}^{-1}$\nsimplifying to $\\{q_F^{N-d} R^{\\left[1+\\frac{N}{2}(d-1)\\right]}N\\}^{-1}$ for\nequidistant atoms, where $d$ is the dimension of the mediating electrons, $q_F$\nthe Fermi wave vector, $L$ the perimeter of the plaquette while $P$ is the\nproduct of interatomic distances.

Development over this method mainly focuses on aggregating contextual\ninformation at different levels while seldom touching the inter-level\ncorrelation in the feature pyramid. Early computer vision methods extracted\nscale-invariant features by locating the feature extrema in both spatial and\nscale dimension. Inspired by this, a convolution across the pyramid level is\nproposed in this study, which is termed pyramid convolution and is a modified\n3-D convolution. Stacked pyramid convolutions directly extract 3-D (scale and\nspatial) features and outperforms other meticulously designed feature fusion\nmodules. Based on the viewpoint of 3-D convolution, an integrated batch\nnormalization that collects statistics from the whole feature pyramid is\nnaturally inserted after the pyramid convolution. Furthermore, we also show\nthat the naive pyramid convolution, together with the design of RetinaNet head,\nactually best applies for extracting features from a Gaussian pyramid, whose\nproperties can hardly be satisfied by a feature pyramid. In order to alleviate\nthis discrepancy, we build a scale-equalizing pyramid convolution (SEPC) that\naligns the shared pyramid convolution kernel only at high-level feature maps.\nBeing computationally efficient and compatible with the head design of most\nsingle-stage object detectors, the SEPC module brings significant performance\nimprovement ($>4$AP increase on MS-COCO2017 dataset) in state-of-the-art\none-stage object detectors, and a light version of SEPC also has $\\sim3.5$AP\ngain with only around 7% inference time increase. The pyramid convolution also\nfunctions well as a stand-alone module in two-stage object detectors and is\nable to improve the performance by $\\sim2$AP.

In many such applications, a key to improving the\nefficiency requires a deep understanding of multiexcitonic states. Herein, we\nelucidate the shell thickness and band alignment dependencies of the biexciton\nAuger recombination lifetime for quasi-type-II CdSe/CdS and type-I CdSe/ZnS\ncore/shell quantum dots. We find that the biexciton Auger recombination\nlifetime increases with the total nanocrystal volume for quasi-type-II CdSe/CdS\ncore/shell quantum dots and is independent of the shell thickness for type-I\nCdSe/ZnS core/shell quantum dots. In order to perform these calculations and\ncompute Auger recombination lifetimes, we developed a low-scaling approach\nbased on the stochastic resolution of identity. The numerical approach provided\na framework to study the scaling of the biexciton Auger recombination lifetimes\nin terms of the shell thickness dependencies of the exciton radii, Coulomb\ncouplings, and density of final states in quasi-type-II CdSe/CdS and type-I\nCdSe/ZnS core/shell quantum dots.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 May 2020 20:00:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-08"}

In particular, our special derivation is unique up\nto duality and equivalence. We prove that no such derivation exists in\nsimply-laced types outside of finite and affine type $A$. We also examine a\nparticular Bott-Samelson bimodule in type $A_7$, which is indecomposable in\ncharacteristic $2$ but decomposable in all other characteristics. We prove that\nthis Bott-Samelson bimodule admits no nontrivial fantastic filtrations in any\ncharacteristic, which is the analogue in the $p$-dg setting of being\nindecomposable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 6 May 2020 20:52:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Feb 2023 17:12:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-05-08"}

More\ngenerally, the optimal design is shown to be the mixed-strategy optimal design\n(MSOD) of Kallus (2018). Notably, even when the set of conditional mean\noutcomes has structure (i.e., is not permutation symmetric), being\nminimax-optimal for variance still requires randomization beyond a single\npartition.

Such attacks train a clone model by using the\npredictions of the target model for different inputs. The effectiveness of such\nattacks relies heavily on the availability of data necessary to query the\ntarget model. Existing attacks either assume partial access to the dataset of\nthe target model or availability of an alternate dataset with semantic\nsimilarities. This paper proposes MAZE -- a data-free model stealing attack\nusing zeroth-order gradient estimation. In contrast to prior works, MAZE does\nnot require any data and instead creates synthetic data using a generative\nmodel. Inspired by recent works in data-free Knowledge Distillation (KD), we\ntrain the generative model using a disagreement objective to produce inputs\nthat maximize disagreement between the clone and the target model. However,\nunlike the white-box setting of KD, where the gradient information is\navailable, training a generator for model stealing requires performing\nblack-box optimization, as it involves accessing the target model under attack.\nMAZE relies on zeroth-order gradient estimation to perform this optimization\nand enables a highly accurate MS attack. Our evaluation with four datasets\nshows that MAZE provides a normalized clone accuracy in the range of 0.91x to\n0.99x, and outperforms even the recent attacks that rely on partial data (JBDA,\nclone accuracy 0.13x to 0.69x) and surrogate data (KnockoffNets, clone accuracy\n0.52x to 0.97x). We also study an extension of MAZE in the partial-data setting\nand develop MAZE-PD, which generates synthetic data closer to the target\ndistribution.

We investigate a\njunction formed between single-layer and bilayer graphene and identify the\nimpact of internal strain and Fermi level pinning by the contacts using a\ndeconvolution method to directly map the local Seebeck coefficient. The new\napproach paves the way for an in-depth understanding of thermoelectric\nbehaviour and phenomena in 2D materials nanostructures and devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 May 2020 00:08:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-25"}

Many\nvariants of the TSP, such as those with neighborhoods, with forbidden\nneighborhoods, with time-windows and with profits, can all be framed under this\nconstruct. In sharp contrast to their discrete-optimization counterparts, the\nmodeling constructs presented in this paper represent a fundamentally new\ndomain of analysis and computation for TSPs and their variants. Beyond its\napparent mathematical unification of a class of problems in graph theory, the\nmain advantage of the new approach is that it facilitates the modeling of\ncertain application-specific problems in their home space of measurable\nfunctions. Consequently, certain elements of economic system theory such as\ndynamical models and continuous-time cost/profit functionals can be directly\nincorporated in the new optimization problem formulation. Furthermore, subtour\nelimination constraints, prevalent in discrete optimization formulations, are\nnaturally enforced through continuity requirements. The price for the new\nmodeling framework is nonsmooth functionals. Although a number of theoretical\nissues remain open in the proposed mathematical framework, we demonstrate the\ncomputational viability of the new modeling constructs over a sample set of\nproblems to illustrate the rapid production of end-to-end TSP solutions to\nextensively-constrained practical problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 May 2020 00:44:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-08"}

A point cloud is considered as a rigid body\nconsisting of particles. The problem of registering two point clouds is\nformulated as a dynamical system, where the dynamic model point cloud\ntranslates and rotates in a viscous environment towards the static scene point\ncloud, under forces and torques induced by virtual springs placed between each\npair of corresponding points. We first show that the potential energy of the\nsystem recovers the objective function of the maximum likelihood estimation. We\nthen adopt Lyapunov analysis, particularly the invariant set theorem, to\nanalyze the rigid body dynamics and show that the system globally\nasymptotically tends towards the set of equilibrium points, where the globally\noptimal registration solution lies in. We conjecture that, besides the globally\noptimal equilibrium point, the system has either three or infinite \"spurious\"\nequilibrium points, and these spurious equilibria are all locally unstable. The\ncase of three spurious equilibria corresponds to generic shape of the point\ncloud, while the case of infinite spurious equilibria happens when the point\ncloud exhibits symmetry.

While performing well in many domains, this setup has the\ninherent risk that the noisy actions performed by the agent lead to unsafe\nstates in the environment.

These models have been receiving a lot of attention in the past\nfew years given their interesting property of forming a Bose-Einstein\ncondensate (BEC) or a superfluid on galactic scales. BEC and superfluidity are\none of the most striking quantum mechanical phenomena manifest on macroscopic\nscales, and upon condensation, the particles behave as a single coherent state,\ndescribed by the wavefunction of the condensate. The idea is that condensation\ntakes place inside galaxies while outside DM behaves like a normal cold\nparticle DM. This wave nature of DM on galactic scales that arise upon\ncondensation can address some of the curiosities of the behaviour of DM on\nsmall scales while maintaining the successes of LCDM on large scales. There are\nmany models in the literature that describe a DM component that condenses in\ngalaxies. In this review, we are going to describe those models and classify\nthem according to the different ways they achieve condensation. For that, we\nreview the phenomena of BEC and superfluidity, and apply this knowledge to the\nDM in order to explain their construction and phenomenology. We describe the\nsmall scale challenges these models aim to solve and how ULDM alleviates them.\nThese models present a rich phenomenology that is manifest in different\nastrophysical consequences. We review here the astrophysical and cosmological\ntests used to constrain those models, together with new and future observations\nthat promise to test these models in different regimes. We finalize by showing\nsome predictions that are a consequence of the wave nature of this component,\nlike vortices and interference, that could represent a smoking gun in the\nsearch of these rich and interesting alternative class of DM.

A feature of these expressions is that, when\nconsidered in the coincidence limit $p \\to P$, they generically exhibit a\ndependence on the geodesic along which the varying point $p$ approached $P$,\nsort of memory of how $p$ went to $P$. This fact demands a deeper understanding\nof the meaning of the quantity $R_{(q)}$, for this latter tells about curvature\nof spacetime as a whole at $P$ and would not be supposed to depend on whichever\nvector we might happen to consider at $P$. Here, we try to search for a\nframework in which these two apparently conflicting aspects might be\nconsistently reconciled.

The countably infinite number of quasinormal modes of a Kerr black hole\nare thus related to each other and any deviations from these relations provide\na strong hint for physics beyond the general theory of relativity. To test the\nno-hair theorem using ringdown signals, it is necessary to detect at least two\nquasinormal modes. In particular, one can detect the fundamental mode along\nwith a subdominant overtone or with another angular mode, depending on the mass\nratio and the spins of the progenitor binary. Also in the light of the recent\ndiscovery of GW190412, studying how the mass ratio affects the prospect of\nblack hole spectroscopy using overtones or angular modes is pertinent, and this\nis the major focus of our study. First, we provide ready-to-use fits for the\namplitudes and phases of both the angular modes and overtones as a function of\nmass ratio $q\\in[0,10]$. Using these fits we estimate the minimum\nsignal-to-noise ratio for detectability, resolvability, and measurability of\nsubdominant modes/tones. We find that performing black-hole spectroscopy with\nangular modes is preferable when the binary mass ratio is larger than $q\\approx\n1.2$ (provided that the source is not located at a particularly disfavoured\ninclination angle). For nonspinning, equal-mass binary black holes, the\novertones seem to be the only viable option to perform a spectroscopy test of\nthe no-hair theorem. However this would require a large ringdown\nsignal-to-noise ratio ($\\approx 100$ for a $5\\%$ accuracy test with two\novertones) and the inclusion of more than one overtone to reduce modelling\nerrors, making black-hole spectroscopy with overtones impractical in the near\nfuture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 May 2020 05:47:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 Aug 2020 16:26:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-31"}

In order to improve the accuracy of automatic detection of\nmajor tissue types and the cerebrospinal fluid in infant's brains within the\nage range from 10 days to 4.5 years, we propose a new classification method\nbased on Kernel Fisher Discriminant Analysis (KFDA) for pattern recognition,\ncombined with an objective structural similarity index (SSIM) for perceptual\nimage quality assessment. The proposed method performs an optimal partitioning\nof the image domain into subdomains having different average intensity values\nand relatively homogeneous tissue intensity. In the KFDA-based framework, a\ncomplex non-linear structure of grey matter, white matter and cerebrospinal\nfluid intensity clusters in a 3D (T1W, T2W, PDW)-space is exploited to find an\naccurate classification. Based on Computer Vision hypothesis that the Human\nVisual System is an optimal structural information extractor, the SSIM finds a\nnew role in the evaluation of the quality of classification. A comparison with\nthe state-of-the-art Partial Volume Estimation method using the SSIM index\ndemonstrates superior performance of the local KFDA-based algorithm in low\ncontrast subdomains and more accurate detection of grey matter, white matter,\nand cerebrospinal fluid patterns in the brain volume.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 May 2020 05:47:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-08"}

Using\nthis research gap as our main motivation, we present an algorithm that\napproximates the smallest data set that needs to be collected in order to\nachieve high control performance for multiple learning-based control laws.

Methods using motion capture data tend to scale poorly\nin complex environments because of their larger capturing and labeling\nrequirement. Physics-based controllers are effective in this regard, albeit\nless controllable. In this paper, we present CARL, a quadruped agent that can\nbe controlled with high-level directives and react naturally to dynamic\nenvironments. Starting with an agent that can imitate individual animation\nclips, we use Generative Adversarial Networks to adapt high-level controls,\nsuch as speed and heading, to action distributions that correspond to the\noriginal animations.

In the absence of the SOC and magnetic field, the ground\nstate changes from the nonmagnetic band-insulating state to the EI state by\nincreasing the Hund coupling. In an applied magnetic field, the magnetic moment\nappears in the EI state, which is continuously connected to the forced\nferromagnetic state. On the other hand, in the presence of the SOC, they are\nseparated by a phase boundary. We find that the magnetic susceptibility is\nstrongly enhanced in the EI phase near the boundary with a small SOC.

The reflection\nfeatures arising from the inner regions of the disc can be significantly\nmodified by the relativistic effects near the black hole. We investigate the\nrelationship between the relativistic reflection fraction $R_f$, defined as the\nratio of the coronal intensity that illuminates the accretion disc to the\ncoronal intensity observed directly, and the hard X-ray photon index $\\Gamma$\nof a NuSTAR sample of Seyfert 1 galaxies. The X-ray spectra are modelled using\nrelxill code which helps to directly obtain the reflection fraction of a\nrelativistically smeared reflection component. The parameter $R_f$ depends on\nthe amount of Comptonised X-ray emission intercepted by the inner accretion\ndisc. We found a positive correlation between $\\Gamma$ and $R_f$ in our sample.\nSeed photons from a larger area of an accretion disc entering the corona will\nresult in increased cooling of the coronal plasma, giving rise to steeper X-ray\nspectrum. The corona irradiating the larger area of the disc will result in\nhigher reflection fraction. Thus, the observed $R_f-\\Gamma$ relation is most\nlikely related to the variations in the disc-corona geometry of AGN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 May 2020 08:06:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-20"}

It has been studied from different contexts by\nemploying mathematical, psychological, and fuzzy approaches. Image\nsteganography is the art of hiding secret data into an image in such a way that\nit cannot be detected by an intruder. In image steganography, hiding secret\ndata in the plain or non-edge regions of the image is significant due to the\nhigh similarity and redundancy of the pixels in their neighborhood. However,\nthe similarity measure of the neighboring pixels, i.e., their proximity in\ncolor space, is perceptual rather than mathematical. This paper proposes an\ninterval type 2 fuzzy logic system (IT2 FLS) to determine the similarity\nbetween the neighboring pixels by involving an instinctive human perception\nthrough a rule-based approach. The pixels of the image having high similarity\nvalues, calculated using the proposed IT2 FLS similarity measure, are selected\nfor embedding via the least significant bit (LSB) method. We term the proposed\nprocedure of steganography as IT2 FLS LSB method. Moreover, we have developed\ntwo more methods, namely, type 1 fuzzy logic system based least significant\nbits (T1FLS LSB) and Euclidean distance based similarity measures for least\nsignificant bit (SM LSB) steganographic methods. Experimental simulations were\nconducted for a collection of images and quality index metrics, such as PSNR,\nUQI, and SSIM are used. All the three steganographic methods are applied on\ndatasets and the quality metrics are calculated. The obtained stego images and\nresults are shown and thoroughly compared to determine the efficacy of the IT2\nFLS LSB method. Finally, we have done a comparative analysis of the proposed\napproach with the existing well-known steganographic methods to show the\neffectiveness of our proposed steganographic method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 May 2020 08:12:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-28"}

Previous numerical\nsimulations of thermal instability and coronal rain formation have relied on\nartificially adding a coronal heating term to the energy equation. To reproduce\nlarge-scale characteristics of the corona, using more realistic coronal heating\nprescription is necessary. We analyse coronal rain formation and evolution in a\n3-dimensional radiative magnetohydrodynamic simulation spanning from convection\nzone to corona which is self-consistently heated by magnetic field braiding as\na result of convective motions. We investigate the spatial and temporal\nevolution of energy dissipation along coronal loops which become thermally\nunstable. Ohmic dissipation in the model leads to the heating events capable of\ninducing sufficient chromospheric evaporation into the loop to trigger thermal\ninstability and condensation formation. The cooling of the thermally unstable\nplasma occurs on timescales comparable to the duration of the individual\nimpulsive heating events. The impulsive heating has sufficient duration to\ntrigger thermal instability in the loop but does not last long enough to lead\nto coronal rain limit cycles. We show that condensations can either survive and\nfall into the chromosphere or be destroyed by strong bursts of Joule heating\nassociated with a magnetic reconnection events.

Despite its wide application, however, its\nimplication to query optimization is not well understood.\n  In this work, we study how bitvector filters impact query optimization. We\nshow that incorporating bitvector filters into query optimization\nstraightforwardly can increase the plan space complexity by an exponential\nfactor in the number of relations in the query. We analyze the plans with\nbitvector filters for star and snowflake queries in the plan space of right\ndeep trees without cross products. Surprisingly, with some simplifying\nassumptions, we prove that, the plan of the minimal cost with bitvector filters\ncan be found from a linear number of plans in the number of relations in the\nquery. This greatly reduces the plan space complexity for such queries from\nexponential to linear.\n  Motivated by our analysis, we propose an algorithm that accounts for the\nimpact of bitvector filters in query optimization.

Recognizing low-resolution text images is\nchallenging because they lose detailed content information, leading to poor\nrecognition accuracy. An intuitive solution is to introduce super-resolution\n(SR) techniques as pre-processing. However, previous single image\nsuper-resolution (SISR) methods are trained on synthetic low-resolution images\n(e.g.Bicubic down-sampling), which is simple and not suitable for real\nlow-resolution text recognition. To this end, we pro-pose a real scene text SR\ndataset, termed TextZoom. It contains paired real low-resolution and\nhigh-resolution images which are captured by cameras with different focal\nlength in the wild. It is more authentic and challenging than synthetic data,\nas shown in Fig. 1. We argue improv-ing the recognition accuracy is the\nultimate goal for Scene Text SR. In this purpose, a new Text Super-Resolution\nNetwork termed TSRN, with three novel modules is developed. (1) A sequential\nresidual block is proposed to extract the sequential information of the text\nimages. (2) A boundary-aware loss is designed to sharpen the character\nboundaries. (3) A central alignment module is proposed to relieve the\nmisalignment problem in TextZoom. Extensive experiments on TextZoom demonstrate\nthat our TSRN largely improves the recognition accuracy by over 13%of CRNN, and\nby nearly 9.0% of ASTER and MORAN compared to synthetic SR data. Furthermore,\nour TSRN clearly outperforms 7 state-of-the-art SR methods in boosting the\nrecognition accuracy of LR images in TextZoom. For example, it outperforms\nLapSRN by over 5% and 8%on the recognition accuracy of ASTER and CRNN. Our\nresults suggest that low-resolution text recognition in the wild is far from\nbeing solved, thus more research effort is needed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 May 2020 09:18:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 21 Jul 2020 05:42:50 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 2 Aug 2020 03:27:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-04"}

The collective dynamics in\noscillatory systems are often described by order parameters, which are\ninsufficient for identifying more specific behaviors. To improve this\nsituation, we propose a topological approach that constructs the quantitative\nfeatures describing the phase evolution of oscillators. Here, the phase data\nare mapped into a high-dimensional space at each time, and the topological\nfeatures describing the shape of the data are subsequently extracted from the\nmapped points. These features are extended to time-variant topological features\nby adding the evolution time as an extra dimension in the topological feature\nspace. The time-variant features provide crucial insights into the evolution of\nphase dynamics. Combining these features with the kernel method, we\ncharacterize the multi-clustered synchronized dynamics during the early\nevolution stages. Finally, we demonstrate that our method can qualitatively\nexplain chimera states.

Material and Methods: Patients, suspected of Covid 19 infection, were\nscanned successively with routine dose, and ULD, with 98% or 94% dose\nreduction, protocols. Axial images of routine and ULD chest CT were evaluated\nobjectively by two expert radiologists and quantitatively by Signal to Noise\nRatio (SNR) and pixel by pixel noise measurement. Results: It was observed that\nthe ULD and routine dose chest CT images could detect Covid 19 related lung\nlesions in patients with PCR positive test.

Each of the given jobs is either\nshort or long. However the processing times are initially hidden to the\nalgorithm, but can be tested. This is done by executing a processing time\noracle, which reveals the processing time of a given job. Each test occupies a\ntime unit in the schedule, therefore the algorithm must decide for which jobs\nit will call the processing time oracle. The objective value of the resulting\nschedule is compared with the objective value of an optimal schedule, which is\ncomputed using full information. The resulting competitive ratio measures the\nprice of hidden processing times, and the goal is to design an algorithm with\nminimal competitive ratio.\n  Two models are studied in this paper. In the non-adaptive model, the\nalgorithm needs to decide beforehand which jobs to test, and which jobs to\nexecute untested. However in the adaptive model, the algorithm can make these\ndecisions adaptively depending on the outcomes of the job tests. In both models\nwe provide optimal polynomial time algorithms following a two-phase strategy,\nwhich consist of a first phase where jobs are tested, and a second phase where\njobs are executed obliviously.

The fault current of a HIF is much lower than\nthat of a normal load, and fault feature is significantly affected by fault\nscenarios. A detection and feeder identification algorithm for HIFs is proposed\nin this paper, based on the high-resolution and synchronous waveform data. In\nthe algorithm, an interval slope is defined to describe the waveform\ndistortions, which guarantees a uniform feature description under various HIF\nnonlinearities and noise interferences. For three typical types of network\nneutrals, i.e.,isolated neutral, resonant neutral, and low-resistor-earthed\nneutral, differences of the distorted components between the zero-sequence\ncurrents of healthy and faulty feeders are mathematically deduced,\nrespectively. As a result, the proposed criterion, which is based on the\ndistortion relationships between zero-sequence currents of feeders and the\nzero-sequence voltage at the substation, is theoretically supported. 28 HIFs\ngrounded to various materials are tested in a 10kV distribution networkwith\nthree neutral types, and are utilized to verify the effectiveness of the\nproposed algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 May 2020 12:23:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-08"}

Instead of the gamma hyperprior, we propose to use the\ninverse gamma hyperprior with a shape parameter close to zero and a scale\nparameter not necessary close to zero. This hyperprior is associated with the\nconcept of a weakly informative prior. The effect of this hyperprior is\ninvestigated through regression to non-homogeneous data. Because it is\ndifficult to capture the structure of such data with a single kernel function,\nwe apply the multiple kernel method, in which multiple kernel functions with\ndifferent widths are arranged for input data. We confirm that the degrees of\nfreedom in a model is controlled by adjusting the scale parameter and keeping\nthe shape parameter close to zero. A candidate for selecting the scale\nparameter is the predictive information criterion. However the estimated model\nusing this criterion seems to cause over-fitting. This is because the multiple\nkernel method makes the model a situation where the dimension of the model is\nlarger than the data size. To select an appropriate scale parameter even in\nsuch a situation, we also propose an extended prediction information criterion.\nIt is confirmed that a multiple kernel relevance vector regression model with\ngood predictive accuracy can be obtained by selecting the scale parameter\nminimizing extended prediction information criterion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 May 2020 12:37:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-08"}

Besides common variance reduction\ntechniques, filter approaches are often applied to achieve conclusive results\nwithin a fraction of time. Inspired by these methods, we propose a novel\napproach. We down-sample the target volume based on the fraction of mass,\nsimulate the imaging situation, and then revert the down-sampling.

Due to the\nstatistical regularities in the creep rate, the time evolution of creep rate\nhas often been used to predict residual lifetime until catastrophic breakdown.\nHowever, in disordered samples, these efforts met with limited success.\nNevertheless, it is clear that as the failure is approached, the damage become\nincreasingly spatially correlated, and the spatio-temporal patterns of acoustic\nemission, which serve as a proxy for damage accumulation activity, are likely\nto mirror such correlations.

The main observational properties related to the baryonic\nmatter in LSBs, investigated over the last decades, are briefly recalled. Next,\nthe LSBs are analysed by means of the mass modelling of their rotation curves\nboth individually and stacked. The latter analysis, via the Universal Rotation\nCurve (URC) method, results really powerful in giving a global/universal\ndescription of the disc galaxies properties. We show the presence in LSBs of\nscaling relations between the galactic structural properties and we compare\nthem with those of galaxies of different morphologies.

In laboratory experiments, the mean\nwaiting time was observed to increase double-exponentially as the Reynolds\nnumber (Re) approaches its critical value. To understand the origin of this\ndouble-exponential increase, we perform many pipe flow direct numerical\nsimulations of the Navier-Stokes equations, and measure the cumulative\nhistogram of the maximum axial vorticity field over the pipe (turbulence\nintensity). In the domain where the turbulence intensity is not small, we\nobserve that the histogram is well-approximated by the Gumbel extreme-value\ndistribution. The smallest turbulence intensity in this domain roughly\ncorresponds to the transition value between the locally stable turbulence and a\nmeta-stable (edge) state. Studying the Re dependence of the fitting parameters\nin this distribution, we derive that the time scale of the transition between\nthese two states increases double-exponentially as Re approaches its critical\nvalue. On the contrary, in smaller turbulence intensities below this domain, we\nobserve that the distribution is not sensible to the change of Re. This means\nthat the decay time of the meta-stable state (to the laminar state) is\nstochastic but Re-independent in average. Our observation suggests that the\nconjecture made by Goldenfeld et al. to derive the double-exponential increase\nof turbulence decay time is approximately satisfied in the range of Re we\nstudied.

Since a single-mode parametric oscillator\nrepresents an analog of a classical Ising spin, networks of coupled parametric\noscillators are considered as simulators of Ising spin models, aiming to\nefficiently calculate the ground state of an Ising network - a computationally\nhard problem. However, the coherent dynamics of coupled parametric oscillators\ncan be considerably richer than that of Ising spins, depending on the nature of\nthe coupling between them (energy preserving or dissipative), as was recently\nshown for two coupled parametric oscillators.

To design a blockchain protocol, we need a block publisher selection\nmechanism and a chain selection rule. In Proof-of-Stake (PoS) based blockchain\nprotocols, block publisher selection mechanism selects the node to publish the\nnext block based on the relative stake held by the node. However, PoS\nprotocols, such as Ouroboros v1, may face vulnerability to fully adaptive\ncorruptions.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel PoS-based blockchain protocol, QuickSync,\nto achieve security against fully adaptive corruptions while improving on\nperformance. We propose a metric called block power, a value defined for each\nblock, derived from the output of the verifiable random function based on the\ndigital signature of the block publisher. With this metric, we compute chain\npower, the sum of block powers of all the blocks comprising the chain, for all\nthe valid chains. These metrics are a function of the block publisher's stake\nto enable the PoS aspect of the protocol. The chain selection rule selects the\nchain with the highest chain power as the one to extend. This chain selection\nrule hence determines the selected block publisher of the previous block. When\nwe use metrics to define the chain selection rule, it may lead to\nvulnerabilities against Sybil attacks. QuickSync uses a Sybil attack resistant\nfunction implemented using histogram matching. We prove that QuickSync\nsatisfies common prefix, chain growth, and chain quality properties and hence\nit is secure. We also show that it is resilient to different types of\nadversarial attack strategies.

This scenario is supported by many local studies showing that\nmagnetic fields could be amplified by the MRI on small scales. However, the\nefficiency of the MRI at generating a dipole field is still unknown. To answer\nthis question, we study the MRI dynamo in an idealized global model of a fast\nrotating protoneutron star with differential rotation. We perform 3D\nincompressible MHD simulations in spherical geometry with explicit\ndiffusivities where the differential rotation is forced at the outer boundary.\nWe vary the initial magnetic field and investigated different magnetic boundary\nconditions.

Unlike gene expression methods for this task that\ncapture aging-specific information but ignore interactions between genes (i.e.,\ntheir protein products), or protein-protein interaction (PPI) network methods\nfor this task that account for PPIs but the PPIs are context-unspecific, we\nrecently integrated the two data types into an aging-specific PPI subnetwork,\nwhich yielded more accurate aging-related gene predictions. However, a dynamic\naging-specific subnetwork did not improve prediction performance compared to a\nstatic aging-specific subnetwork, despite the aging process being dynamic. This\ncould be because the dynamic subnetwork was inferred using a naive Induced\nsubgraph approach. Instead, we recently inferred a dynamic aging-specific\nsubnetwork using a methodologically more advanced notion of network propagation\n(NP), which improved upon Induced dynamic aging-specific subnetwork in a\ndifferent task, that of unsupervised analyses of the aging process. Here, we\nevaluate whether our existing NP-based dynamic subnetwork will improve upon the\ndynamic as well as static subnetwork constructed by the Induced approach in the\nconsidered task of supervised prediction of aging-related genes. The existing\nNP-based subnetwork is unweighted, i.e., it gives equal importance to each of\nthe aging-specific PPIs. Because accounting for aging-specific edge weights\nmight be important, we additionally propose a weighted NP-based dynamic\naging-specific subnetwork. We demonstrate that a predictive machine learning\nmodel trained and tested on the weighted subnetwork yields higher accuracy when\npredicting aging-related genes than predictive models run on the existing\nunweighted dynamic or static subnetworks, regardless of whether the existing\nsubnetworks were inferred using NP or the Induced approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 May 2020 01:50:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Aug 2020 16:48:44 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 13 Apr 2021 16:03:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-14"}

CT imaging has been used as a\ncomplementary tool to assist early screening, especially for the rapid\nidentification of COVID-19 cases from community acquired pneumonia (CAP) cases.\nThe main challenge in early screening is how to model the confusing cases in\nthe COVID-19 and CAP groups, with very similar clinical manifestations and\nimaging features. To tackle this challenge, we propose an Uncertainty\nVertex-weighted Hypergraph Learning (UVHL) method to identify COVID-19 from CAP\nusing CT images. In particular, multiple types of features (including regional\nfeatures and radiomics features) are first extracted from CT image for each\ncase. Then, the relationship among different cases is formulated by a\nhypergraph structure, with each case represented as a vertex in the hypergraph.\nThe uncertainty of each vertex is further computed with an uncertainty score\nmeasurement and used as a weight in the hypergraph. Finally, a learning process\nof the vertex-weighted hypergraph is used to predict whether a new testing case\nbelongs to COVID-19 or not. Experiments on a large multi-center pneumonia\ndataset, consisting of 2,148 COVID-19 cases and 1,182 CAP cases from five\nhospitals, are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.\nResults demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method on\nthe identification of COVID-19 in comparison to state-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 May 2020 11:26:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-11"}

In reality these assumptions cannot be readily met, as a\ntransmitter's bandwidth may only be scanned intermittently, partially, or\nalongside other transmitters, and modulation obfuscation may be introduced by\nshort-lived scans or malicious activity.\n  This paper presents LinksIQ, which bridges the gap between real-world\nspectrum sensing and the growing body of modrec methods designed under\nsimplifying assumptions. Our key insight is that ordered IQ samples form\ndistinctive patterns across modulations, which persist even with scan\ndeficiencies.

A\nheterogeneous mean-field approximation has been previously proposed for the\nIsing model of the Barab\\'{a}si-Albert model of scale-free networks with\nclassical spins on the nodes wherein it was shown that the critical temperature\nfor such a system scales logarithmically with network size. For finite sizes,\nthere is no criticality for such a system and hence no true phase transition in\nterms of singular behavior. Further, in the thermodynamic limit, the mean-field\nprediction of an infinite critical temperature for the system may exclude any\ntrue phase transition even then. Nevertheless, with an eye on potential\napplications of the model on biological systems that are generally finite, one\nmay still try to find approximations that describe the relevant observables\nquantitatively. Here we present an alternative, approximate formulation for the\ndescription of the Ising model of a Barab\\'{a}si-Albert Network. Using the\nclassical definition of magnetization, we show that Ising models on a network\ncan be well-approximated by a long-range interacting homogeneous Ising model\nwherein each node of the network couples to all other spins with a strength\ndetermined by the mean degree of the Barab\\'{a}si-Albert Network. In such an\neffective long-range Ising model of a Barab\\'{a}si-Albert Network, the critical\ntemperature is directly proportional to the number of preferentially attached\nlinks added to grow the network. The proposed model describes the magnetization\nof the majority of the sites with average or smaller than average degree better\ncompared to the heterogeneous mean-field approximation. The long-range Ising\nmodel is the only homogeneous description of Barab\\'{a}si-Albert networks that\nwe know of.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 May 2020 08:11:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-12"}

The amplitude of the temperature anisotropy caused by the\nCMB shadow, due to dust components, is about 1 uK. This value is comparable to\nthe required noise level necessary to probe non-Gaussianity studies with\nupcoming CMB experiments. In addition, the amplitude of the polarization caused\nby the CMB shadow due to dust is comparable to or larger than the RMS value of\nthe CMB B-mode polarization, imprinted by primordial gravitational waves. We\nshow that applying a single-power law model as the dust spectrum to observed\nmultifrequency data introduces systematic errors, which are comparable to or\nlarger than the required noise level for forthcoming CMB B-mode polarization\nexperiments. Deducing the intrinsic spectrum of dust emission from the\nsubmillimeter waveband data reduces systematic error below the required noise\nlevel. However, this method requires dust temperature measurements with an\naccuracy of better than a few percent. We conclude that the CMB shadow due to\ndust must be considered in future CMB missions for achieving their targeted\nsensitivity.

In this paper, we study this\nequation in a periodic medium: a unit cell repeated over the nodes of a\nlattice. Although the gradient term of the equation is not invariant by lattice\ntranslations, the equation can be analyzed within a single unit cell by\nreplacing a continuous-time gradient profile by narrow pulses. In this\napproximation, the effects of precession and diffusion are separated and the\nproblem is reduced to the study of a sequence of diffusion equations with\npseudo-periodic boundary conditions. This representation allows for efficient\nnumerical computations as well as new theoretical insights into the formation\nof the signal in periodic media. In particular, we study the eigenmodes and\neigenvalues of the Bloch-Torrey operator. We show how the localization of\neigenmodes is related to branching points in the spectrum and we discuss low-\nand high-gradient asymptotic behaviors. The range of validity of the\napproximation is discussed; interestingly the method turns out to be more\naccurate and efficient at high gradient, being thus an important complementary\ntool to conventional numerical methods that are most accurate at low gradients.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 7 May 2020 11:32:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-14"}
