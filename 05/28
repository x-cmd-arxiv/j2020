To maximize the system secrecy rate, the\ntransmit beamforming at the BS and the reflecting matrix at the IRS are jointly\noptimized with transmit power and discrete phase-shift constraints. It is first\nproved that the beamforming design is independent of the phase shift design\nunder the rank-one channel assumption.

The characteristic features of the CPGE,\nwhich displays a sign change at 0.4 eV and a large non-quantized response peak\nof around 160 $\\mu \\textrm{A V}^{-2}$ at 0.7 eV, are explained by assuming that\nthe chemical potential crosses a flat hole band at the Brillouin zone center.\nOur theory predicts that, in order to observe a quantized CPGE in RhSi, it is\nnecessary to increase the chemical potential as well as the quasiparticle\nlifetime.

With the help of forward-secure digital\nsignatures, our solution makes sure that superseded and possibly compromised\nconfigurations are harmless, that slow clients cannot be fooled into reading\nstale data, and that Byzantine clients cannot cause a denial of service by\nflooding the system with reconfiguration requests.

It corresponds to the\nwell-known Gross-Pitaevskii equation. However, the quantum Bohm potential,\nwhich is a part of the momentum flux, has a nontrivial part with can evolve\nunder the quantum fluctuations. To cover this phenomenon in terms of\nhydrodynamic methods we need to derive equations for the momentum flux, and the\nthird rank tensor. In all equations we consider the main contribution of the\nshort-range interaction (SRI) in the first order by the interaction radius.\nDerived hydrodynamics consists of four hydrodynamic equations. The third moment\nevolution equation contains interaction leading to the quantum fluctuations. It\nincludes new interaction constant. The Gross-Pitaevskii interaction constant is\nthe integral of potential, but the second interaction constant is the integral\nof second derivative of potential. If we have dipolar BECs we deal with a\nlong-range interaction. Its contribution is proportional to the potential of\ndipole-dipole interaction (DDI). The Euler equation contains the derivative of\nthe potential. The third rank tensor evolution equation contains the third\nderivative of the potential. The quantum fluctuations lead to existence of the\nsecond wave solution. Moreover, the quantum fluctuations introduce the\ninstability of BECs. If the DDI is attractive, but being smaller then the\nrepulsive SRI presented by the first interaction constant, there is the\nlong-wavelength instability. For the repulsive DDI these is more complex\npicture. There is the small area with the long-wavelength instability which\ntransits into stability interval, where two waves exist.

We\ncharacterized differences in several basic statistics of this network over\ntime, highlighting how they have changed with respect to relevant historical\nevents.

However,\nwomen still comprise less than 25% of the INFORMS society and an even smaller\nfraction of authors with many publications. Moreover, we describe a methodology\nfor quantifying the structural role of an authorship with respect to the\noverall connectivity of the network, using it to measure subtle differences\nbetween authorships by women and by men. Specifically, as measures of\nstructural importance of an authorship, we use effective resistance and\ncontraction importance, two measures related to diffusion throughout a network.\nAs a null model, we propose a degree-preserving temporal and geometric network\nmodel with emergent communities.

This principle is analogous to\nthe Natural Flavour Conservation (NFC) of Glashow and Weinberg with the key\ndistinction that NFC required the introduction of a flavour blind symmetry,\nwhile the TP requires a flavoured symmetry, to be implemented in a natural way.\nWe provide two examples which satisfy the Trinity Principle based on\n$\\mathbb{Z}_3$ and $\\mathbb{Z}_2\\times\\mathbb{Z}_2'$ flavoured symmetries, and\nshow that they are the minimal multi-Higgs extensions of the Standard Model\nwhere CP can be imposed as a symmetry of the full Lagrangian and broken by the\nvacuum, without requiring soft-breaking terms.

Another defense approach involves\ntransformation or purification of the original input to remove adversarial\nsignals before the image is classified. We focus on defending naturally-trained\nclassifiers using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling with an Energy-Based\nModel (EBM) for adversarial purification. In contrast to adversarial training,\nour approach is intended to secure pre-existing and highly vulnerable\nclassifiers.\n  The memoryless behavior of long-run MCMC sampling will eventually remove\nadversarial signals, while metastable behavior preserves consistent appearance\nof MCMC samples after many steps to allow accurate long-run prediction.\nBalancing these factors can lead to effective purification and robust\nclassification.

Our second result gives conditions under which the n-strand braid\ngroup of a graph is isomorphic to its discrete analog.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 May 2020 18:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-29"}

Both\nphases are radically different in their dynamical properties, which are\ncharacterized by highly excited eigenstates of the Hamiltonian. Each eigenstate\ncan be characterized by the set of quantum numbers over the set of (local, in\nthe MBL phase) integrals of motion of the system. In this work we study the\nevolution of the eigenstates of the disordered Heisenberg model as the disorder\nstrength, $W$, is varied adiabatically. We focus on the probability that two\n`colliding' eigenstates hybridize as a function of both the range $R$ at which\nthey differ as well as the strength of their hybridization. We find, in the MBL\nphase, that the probability of a colliding eigenstate hybridizing strongly at\nrange $R$ decays as $Pr(R)\\propto \\exp [-R/\\eta]$, with a length scale $\\eta(W)\n= 1 / (B \\log(W / W_c) )$ which diverges at the critical disorder strength\n$W_c$. This leads to range-invariance at the transition, suggesting the\nformation of resonating cat states at all ranges. This range invariance does\nnot survive to the ergodic phase, where hybridization is exponentially more\nlikely at large range, a fact that can be understood with simple combinatorial\narguments. In fact, compensating for these combinatorial effects allows us to\ndefine an additional correlation length $\\xi$ in the MBL phase which is in\nexcellent agreement with previous works and which takes the critical value $1 /\n\\log(2)$ at the transition, found in previous works to destabilize the MBL\nphase. Finally, we show that deep in the MBL phase hybridization is dominated\nby two-level collisions of eigenstates close in energy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 May 2020 18:00:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-29"}

We study\nthe possibility that exominor bodies and exodust deliver volatiles and\nrefractories to the exoplanets in the system HR8799 by performing N-body\nsimulations. The model consists of the host star, four giant planets (HR8799 e,\nd, c, and b), 650000 test particles representing the inner belt, and 1450000\ntest particles representing the outer belt. Moreover we modelled dust\npopulations that originate from both belts. Within a million years, the two\nbelts evolve towards the expected dynamical structure (also derived in other\nworks), where mean-motion resonances with the planets carve the analogues of\nKirkwood gaps. We find that, after this point, the planets suffer impacts by\nobjects from the inner and outer belt at rates that are essentially constant\nwith time, while dust populations do not contribute significantly to the\ndelivery process. We convert the impact rates to volatile and refractory\ndelivery rates using our best estimates of the total mass contained in the\nbelts and their volatile and refractory content. Over their lifetime, the four\ngiant planets receive between $10^{-4}$ and $10^{-3}M_\\bigoplus$ of material\nfrom both belts.

The dynamics of\nentanglement has recently been studied in the context of measurement-induced\nentanglement transitions, where the steady-state entanglement collapses from a\nvolume-law to an area-law at a critical measurement probability $p_{c}$.\nInterestingly, there is a distinction in the value of $p_{c}$ depending on how\nwell the underlying unitary dynamics scramble quantum information. For strongly\nchaotic systems, $p_{c} > 0$, whereas for weakly chaotic systems, such as\nintegrable models, $p_{c} = 0$. In this work, we investigate these\nmeasurement-induced entanglement transitions in a system where the underlying\nunitary dynamics are many-body localized (MBL). We demonstrate that the\nemergent integrability in an MBL system implies a qualitative difference in the\nnature of the measurement-induced transition depending on the measurement\nbasis, with $p_{c} > 0$ when the measurement basis is scrambled and $p_{c} = 0$\nwhen it is not. This feature is not found in Haar-random circuit models, where\nall local operators are scrambled in time. When the transition occurs at $p_{c}\n> 0$, we use finite-size scaling to obtain the critical exponent $\\nu =\n1.3(2)$, close to the value for 2+0D percolation. We also find a dynamical\ncritical exponent of $z = 0.98(4)$ and logarithmic scaling of the R\\'{e}nyi\nentropies at criticality, suggesting an underlying conformal symmetry at the\ncritical point. This work further demonstrates how the nature of the\nmeasurement-induced entanglement transition depends on the scrambling nature of\nthe underlying unitary dynamics. This leads to further questions on the control\nand simulation of entangled quantum states by measurements in open quantum\nsystems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 May 2020 19:26:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-21"}

While various models and datasets have shown\nhigh accuracy inthe task of binary classification, the task of fine-grained\nsentiment classification is still an area with room for significant\nimprovement. Analyzing the SST-5 dataset,previous work by Munikar et al. (2019)\nshowed that the embedding tool BERT allowed a simple model to achieve\nstate-of-the-art accuracy. Since that paper, several BERT alternatives have\nbeen published, with three primary ones being AlBERT (Lan et al., 2019),\nDistilBERT (Sanh et al. 2019), and RoBERTa (Liu etal. 2019). While these models\nreport some improvement over BERT on the popular benchmarks GLUE, SQuAD, and\nRACE, they have not been applied to the fine-grained classification task. In\nthis paper, we examine whether the improvements hold true when applied to a\nnovel task, by replicating the BERT model from Munikar et al., and swapping the\nembedding layer to the alternative models. Over the experiments, we found that\nAlBERT suffers significantly more accuracy loss than reported on other tasks,\nDistilBERT has accuracy loss similar to their reported loss on other tasks\nwhile being the fastest model to train, and RoBERTa reaches anew\nstate-of-the-art accuracy for prediction on the SST-5 root level (60.2%).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 May 2020 20:01:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-29"}

In any regression problem, it is\noften of interest to learn which variables are most active. Variable activity\nin BART is usually measured by counting the number of times a tree splits for\neach variable. Such one-way counts have the advantage of fast computations.\nDespite their convenience, one-way counts have several issues.

An\nalternative method well-established in the literature is Sobol' indices, a\nvariance-based global sensitivity analysis technique. However, these indices\noften require Monte Carlo integration, which can be computationally expensive.\nThis paper provides analytic expressions for Sobol' indices for BART posterior\nsamples. These expressions are easy to interpret and are computationally\nfeasible. Furthermore, we will show a fascinating connection between\nfirst-order (main-effects) Sobol' indices and one-way counts.

Here we\nanalyse how such BH spin-induced angular dependence affects the dynamics and\nenergetics of the radiation pressure-driven outflows, as well as AGN\nobscuration and BH accretion. In addition, we explore the effect of a spatially\nvarying dust-to-gas ratio on the outflow propagation. We obtain two distinct\ntrends for high-spin and low-spin objects, providing a direct connection\nbetween anisotropic feedback and BH spin. In the case of maximum spin, powerful\nquasi-spherical outflows can propagate on large scales, at all inclination\nangles with fairly uniform energetics. In contrast, in the case of zero spin,\nonly weaker bipolar outflows can be driven in the polar directions. As a\nresult, high BH spins can efficiently clear out the obscuring gas from most\ndirections, whereas low BH spins can only remove dusty gas from the polar\nregions, hence also determining the overall AGN obscuration geometry. Due to\nsuch anisotropic feedback, high BH spins can prevent accretion of gas from most\ndirections (except in the equatorial plane), while low BH spins allow inflows\nto proceed from a wider range of directions. This may have important\nimplications for the BH growth in the early Universe.

PNKH-B is geared\ntoward situations in which function and gradient evaluations are expensive, and\nthe (approximate) Hessian is only available through matrix-vector products.\nThis is commonly the case in large-scale parameter estimation, machine\nlearning, and image processing. In each iteration, PNKH-B uses a low-rank\napproximation of the (approximate) Hessian to determine the search direction\nand construct the metric used in a projected line search. The key feature of\nthe metric is its consistency with the low-rank approximation of the Hessian on\nthe Krylov subspace. This renders PNKH-B similar to a projected variable metric\nmethod. We present an interior point method to solve the quadratic projection\nproblem efficiently. Since the interior point method effectively exploits the\nlow-rank structure, its computational cost only scales linearly with respect to\nthe number of variables, and it only adds negligible computational time. We\nalso experiment with variants of PNKH-B that incorporate estimates of the\nactive set into the Hessian approximation. We prove the global convergence to a\nstationary point under standard assumptions. Using three numerical experiments\nmotivated by parameter estimation, machine learning, and image reconstruction,\nwe show that the consistent use of the Hessian metric in PNKH-B leads to fast\nconvergence, particularly in the first few iterations.

High resolution scanning transmission electron\nmicroscopy (HR-STEM) imaging is an excellent tool that provides spatial\nresolution at the atomic scale and strain information by applying Geometric\nPhase Analysis or image fitting procedures. However, HR-STEM images regularly\nsuffer from scanning distortions and sample drift during image acquisition. In\nthis paper, we propose a new scanning strategy that drastically reduces\nartefacts due to drift and scanning distortion, along with extending the field\nof view. The method allows flexible tuning of the spatial resolution and\ndecouples the choice of field of view from the need for local atomic\nresolution. It consists of the acquisition of a series of independent small\nsubimages containing an atomic resolution image of the local lattice. All\nsubimages are then analysed individually for strain by fitting a nonlinear\nmodel to the lattice images. The obtained experimental strain maps are\nquantitatively benchmarked against the Bessel diffraction technique. We\ndemonstrate that the proposed scanning strategy approaches the performance of\nthe diffraction technique while having the advantage that it does not require\nspecialized diffraction cameras.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 May 2020 21:43:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Mar 2021 11:36:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-08"}

A mixing layer is subjected to\ncounterflow in the transverse y- and z-directions. Both non-reactive and\nreactive flows are examined. Reduction of the three-dimensional boundary-layer\nequations to a one-dimensional similar form is obtained allowing for heat and\nmass diffusion with variations in density and properties. In steady\nconfigurations, a set of ODEs governs the three velocity components as well as\nthe scalar-field variables. A flamelet model for individual diffusion flames\nwith combined shear and normal strain is developed. Another model with solution\nin similar form is obtained for a configuration with a dominant diffusion flame\nand a weaker fuel-rich premixed flame. Results for the velocity and scalar\nfields are found for ranges of Damkohler number Da, normal strain rate due to\nthe counterflow, streamwise-velocity ratio across the mixing layer, Prandtl\nnumber, and Mach number. For the flamelet model, a conserved scalar is cast as\nthe independent variable to give an alternative description of the results. The\nimposed normal strain decreases mixing-layer thickness and increases scalar\ngradients and transport rates. There is indication of diffusion control for\npartially premixed flames in the multi-branched flame situation. The\nenhancement of the mixing and combustion rates by imposed normal strain on a\nshear layer can be very substantial. Also, the imposition of shear strain and\nthereby vorticity on the counterflow can be substantial indicating the need for\nflamelet models with both shear strain and normal strain.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 May 2020 21:53:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-16"}

We focus on the\ndetection and segmentation of oncology-significant (or suspicious cancer\nmetastasized) lymph nodes (OSLNs), which has not been studied before as a\ncomputational task. Determining and delineating the spread of OSLNs is\nessential in defining the corresponding resection/irradiating regions for the\ndownstream workflows of surgical resection and radiotherapy of various cancers.\nFor patients who are treated with radiotherapy, this task is performed by\nexperienced radiation oncologists that involves high-level reasoning on whether\nLNs are metastasized, which is subject to high inter-observer variations. In\nthis work, we propose a divide-and-conquer decision stratification approach\nthat divides OSLNs into tumor-proximal and tumor-distal categories. This is\nmotivated by the observation that each category has its own different\nunderlying distributions in appearance, size and other characteristics. Two\nseparate detection-by-segmentation networks are trained per category and fused.\nTo further reduce false positives (FP), we present a novel global-local network\n(GLNet) that combines high-level lesion characteristics with features learned\nfrom localized 3D image patches.

However, its performance at short block lengths is far from optimal.\nArikan has recently presented a new polar coding scheme, which he called\npolarization-adjusted convolutional (PAC) codes. Such PAC codes provide\ndramatic improvement in performance as compared to both standard\nsuccessive-cancellation decoding as well as CRC-aided list decoding. Arikan's\nPAC codes are based primarily upon the following ideas: replacing CRC precoding\nwith convolutional precoding (under appropriate rate profiling) and replacing\nlist decoding by sequential decoding. His simulations show that PAC codes,\nresulting from the combination of these ideas, are close to finite-length\nbounds on the performance of any code under ML decoding.\n  One of our main goals in this paper is to answer the following question: is\nsequential decoding essential for the superior performance of PAC codes? We\nshow that similar performance can be achieved using list decoding when the list\nsize $L$ is moderately large (say, $L \\ge 128$). List decoding has distinct\nadvantages over sequential decoding is certain scenarios, such as low-SNR\nregimes or situations where the worst-case complexity/latency is the primary\nconstraint. Another objective is to provide some insights into the remarkable\nperformance of PAC codes. We first observe that both sequential decoding and\nlist decoding of PAC codes closely match ML decoding thereof. We then estimate\nthe number of low weight codewords in PAC codes, using these estimates to\napproximate the union bound on their performance under ML decoding. These\nresults indicate that PAC codes are superior to both polar codes and\nReed-Muller codes, and suggest that the goal of rate-profiling may be to\noptimize the weight distribution at low weights.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 May 2020 23:41:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-21"}

Here, we report the staircase-like transfer\ncharacteristics of FETs with exfoliated multilayer MoS2 flakes. Atomic force\nmicroscope characterizations reveal that the presence of thinner terraces at\nthe edges of the flakes accompanies the staircase-like characteristics. The\nanomalous staircase-like characteristics are ascribable to a difference in\nthreshold-voltage shift by charge transfer from surface adsorbates between the\nchannel center and the thinner terrace at the edge. This study reveals the\nimportance of the uniformity of channel thickness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 May 2020 01:05:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-29"}

The central feature of the\nsolutions is the strengthening of waves as they move radially inward toward the\norigin. Various examples have shown that the spherically symmetric solutions of\nthe Euler equations blow up near the origin at certain time. A fundamental\nunsolved problem is whether the density of the global solution would form\nconcentration to become a measure near the origin for the case when the total\ninitial-energy is unbounded and the wave propagation is not at a finite speed\nstarting initially. In this paper, we establish a global existence theory for\nspherically symmetric solutions of the compressible Euler equations with large\ninitial data of positive far-field density and relative finite-energy. This is\nachieved by developing a new approach via adapting a class of degenerate\ndensity-dependent viscosity terms, so that a rigorous proof of the vanishing\nviscosity limit of global weak solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations with\nthe density-dependent viscosity terms to the corresponding global solution of\nthe Euler equations with large initial data of spherical symmetry and positive\nfar-field density can be obtained. One of our main observations is that the\nadapted class of degenerate density-dependent viscosity terms not only includes\nthe viscosity terms for the Navier-Stokes equations for shallow water (Saint\nVenant) flows but also, more importantly, is suitable to achieve our key\nobjective of this paper. These results indicate that concentration is not\nformed in the vanishing viscosity limit for the Navier-Stokes approximations\nconstructed in this paper even when the total initial-energy is unbounded.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 May 2020 01:12:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Jun 2020 23:16:23 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2021 01:12:17 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 15 Feb 2022 23:17:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-17"}

When a job arrives, the system\nmust decide whether to admit it or reject it, and if admitted, in which server\nto schedule the job. The objective is to maximize the expected total reward\nreceived by the system. This problem is motivated by control of cloud computing\nclusters, in which, jobs are requests for Virtual Machines or Containers that\nreserve resources for various services, and rewards represent service priority\nof requests or price paid per time unit of service by clients. We study this\nproblem in an asymptotic regime where the number of servers and jobs' arrival\nrates scale by a factor $L$, as $L$ becomes large.

Helping individuals understand their air\npollution exposure and health risks, the traditional way is to utilize data\nfrom static monitoring stations and estimate air pollution qualities in a large\narea by government agencies. Data from such sensing system is very sparse and\ncannot reflect real personal exposure. In recent years, several research groups\nhave developed participatory air pollution sensing systems which use wearable\nor portable units coupled with smartphones to crowd-source urban air pollution\ndata. These systems have shown remarkable improvement in spatial granularity\nover government-operated fixed monitoring systems. In this paper, we extend the\nparadigm to HazeDose system, which can personalize the individuals' air\npollution exposure. Specifically, we combine the pollution concentrations\nobtained from an air pollution estimation system with the activity data from\nthe individual's on-body activity monitors to estimate the personal inhalation\ndosage of air pollution.

One heuristic algorithm is also introduced to balance\nthe execution time and dosage reduction for alternative routes scenarios.

The task of\nuniversal lesion detection (ULD) was proposed to address this challenge by\ndetecting a large variety of lesions from the whole body. There are multiple\nheterogeneously labeled datasets with varying label completeness: DeepLesion,\nthe largest dataset of 32,735 annotated lesions of various types, but with even\nmore missing annotation instances; and several fully-labeled single-type lesion\ndatasets, such as LUNA for lung nodules and LiTS for liver tumors.

SCT's contribution is two-fold: a)\nclassification of the user's contact as high/low-risk using precise proximity\nsensing, and b) user anonymity using a privacy-preserving communications\nprotocol.

We extend the\nsingle-shot approach to stereo vision by application of attention architecture.\nOur convolutional neural network model regresses to object locations and\nrotations from either a left image or a right image without depth information.\nThen, a stereo feature matching module, designated as Stereo Grid Attention,\ngenerates stereo grid matching maps. The important point of our method is only\nto calculate disparity of the objects found by the attention from stereo\nimages, instead of calculating a point cloud over the entire image. The\ndisparity value is then used to calculate the depth to the objects by the\nprinciple of triangulation. Our method also achieves a rapid processing speed\nof pose estimation by the single-shot architecture and it is possible to\nprocess a 1024 x 1024 pixels image in 75 milliseconds on the Jetson AGX Xavier\nimplemented with half-float model. Weakly textured mechanical parts are used to\nexemplify the method. First, we create original synthetic datasets for training\nand evaluating of the proposed model.

Both\nnumerical analysis and experimental results with unitary gates demonstrate low\nmeasurement costs, of order $O(d^2)$ for $d$-dimensional systems, and\nrobustness against statistical noise. Our work potentially paves the way for a\nreliable and highly compressive characterization of general quantum devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 May 2020 04:53:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-29"}

In addition, classic model-free\nlearning ignores the domain information contained in the state transition\ntuples. Model-based RL, on the other hand, attempts to learn a model of the\nenvironment from experience and is substantially more sample efficient, but\nsuffers from significantly large asymptotic bias owing to the imperfect\ndynamics model. In this paper, we propose a gradient matching algorithm to\nimprove sample efficiency by utilizing target slope information from the\ndynamics predictor to aid the model-free learner. We demonstrate this by\npresenting a technique for matching the gradient information from the\nmodel-based learner with the model-free component in an abstract\nlow-dimensional space and validate the proposed technique through experimental\nresults that demonstrate the efficacy of this approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 May 2020 05:02:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-29"}

In the\ne-commerce domain, recent work in query understanding focuses on the query to\nproduct-category mapping. But, a small yet significant percentage of queries\n(in our website 1.5% or 33M queries in 2019) have non-commercial intent\nassociated with them. These intents are usually associated with non-commercial\ninformation seeking needs such as discounts, store hours, installation guides,\netc. In this paper, we introduce Joint Query Intent Understanding (JointMap), a\ndeep learning model to simultaneously learn two different high-level user\nintent tasks: 1) identifying a query's commercial vs. non-commercial intent,\nand 2) associating a set of relevant product categories in taxonomy to a\nproduct query. JointMap model works by leveraging the transfer bias that exists\nbetween these two related tasks through a joint-learning process. As curating a\nlabeled data set for these tasks can be expensive and time-consuming, we\npropose a distant supervision approach in conjunction with an active learning\nmodel to generate high-quality training data sets. To demonstrate the\neffectiveness of JointMap, we use search queries collected from a large\ncommercial website. Our results show that JointMap significantly improves both\n\"commercial vs. non-commercial\" intent prediction and product category mapping\nby 2.3% and 10% on average over state-of-the-art deep learning methods.

In this paper, we propose an\nefficient scheme that enables the SO to detect electricity theft, compute\nbills, and monitor load while preserving the consumers' privacy. The idea is\nthat SMs encrypt their readings using functional encryption, and the SO uses\nthe ciphertexts to (i) compute the bills following dynamic pricing approach,\n(ii) monitor the grid load, and (iii) evaluate a machine-learning model to\ndetect fraudulent consumers, without being able to learn the individual\nreadings to preserve consumers' privacy. We adapted a functional encryption\nscheme so that the encrypted readings are aggregated for billing and load\nmonitoring and only the aggregated value is revealed to the SO. Also, we\nexploited the inner-product operations on encrypted readings to evaluate a\nmachine-learning model to detect fraudulent consumers. Real dataset is used to\nevaluate our scheme, and our evaluations indicate that our scheme is secure and\ncan detect fraudulent consumers accurately with low communication and\ncomputation overhead.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 May 2020 06:20:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-29"}

However, existing discriminant-based\nmethods are challenged by computation inefficiency, as there is a lack of\ntheoretical guidance on quantifying the feature-map discriminant power.

In particular, for complex domains, an\nutterance is often routed to a single component responsible for that domain.\nThus, correctly mapping a user utterance to the right domain is critical. To\naddress this problem, we introduce ConCET: a Concurrent Entity-aware\nconversational Topic classifier, which incorporates entity-type information\ntogether with the utterance content features. Specifically, ConCET utilizes\nentity information to enrich the utterance representation, combining character,\nword, and entity-type embeddings into a single representation.

The best\nway to avoid this problem is by charging coordination. The idea is that the EVs\nshould report data (such as state-of-charge (SoC) of the battery) to run a\nmechanism to prioritize the charging requests and select the EVs that should\ncharge during this time slot and defer other requests to future time slots.\nHowever, EVs may lie and send false data to receive high charging priority\nillegally. In this paper, we first study this attack to evaluate the gains of\nthe lying EVs and how their behavior impacts the honest EVs and the performance\nof charging coordination mechanism. Our evaluations indicate that lying EVs\nhave a greater chance to get charged comparing to honest EVs and they degrade\nthe performance of the charging coordination mechanism. Then, an anomaly based\ndetector that is using deep neural networks (DNN) is devised to identify the\nlying EVs. To do that, we first create an honest dataset for charging\ncoordination application using real driving traces and information revealed by\nEV manufacturers, and then we also propose a number of attacks to create\nmalicious data. We trained and evaluated two models, which are the multi-layer\nperceptron (MLP) and the gated recurrent unit (GRU) using this dataset and the\nGRU detector gives better results. Our evaluations indicate that our detector\ncan detect lying EVs with high accuracy and low false positive rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 May 2020 07:16:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-29"}

In addition, as required by the\nassumption of the MOND framework, we realistically include the external\ngravitational field of the Milky Way and of the large-scale structure beyond\nthe Local Group. For the dwarfs where the external field dominates over the\ninternal gravitational field, the phantom dark matter has, from the star\ndistribution, an offset of ~0.1-0.2 kpc, depending on the mass-to-light ratio\nadopted. This offset is a substantial fraction of the dwarf half-mass radius.\nFor Sculptor and Fornax, where the internal and external gravitational fields\nare comparable, the phantom dark matter distribution appears disturbed with\nspikes at the locations where the two fields cancel each other; these features\nhave little connection with the distribution of the stars within the dwarfs.\nFinally, we find that the external field due to the large-scale structure\nbeyond the Local Group has a very minor effect. The features of the phantom\ndark matter we find represent a genuine prediction of MOND, and could thus\nfalsify this theory of gravity in the version we adopt here if they are not\nobservationally confirmed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 May 2020 08:04:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2020 07:53:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-02"}

We analyze how this electric current is generated by\nan exchange interaction and an external ac magnetic field, which is the driving\nforce of ferromagnetic resonance as well as the spin pumping. The mechanism is\nas follows. First, the ferromagnetic resonance is driven and a zero-momentum\nmagnon emerges. It is the fluctuation from the saturation magnetization\npointing parallel to the precession axis of the ferromagnetic resonance. After\nthen, the spin pumping is generated with the zero-momentum magnon being the\ncarrier of spin. The zero-momentum magnon and the topological insulator surface\nstate couples through the exchange interaction and the spin carried by the\nmagnon is transferred to it. Owing to the spin-momentum locking, the\ntransferred spin is converted into the momentum of topological insulator\nsurface state leading to the generation of electric current flowing\nperpendicular to the precession axis of the ferromagnetic resonance. It is\nquadratic in the amplitude of external ac magnetic field whereas it is linear\nto the strength of the exchange interaction.

Therein, the distance traveled by a single\nvehicle and the number of unserved dynamic requests is minimized by a dynamic\nevolutionary multi-objective algorithm (DEMOA), which operates on discrete time\nwindows (eras). A decision is made at each era by a decision-maker, thus any\ndecision depends on irreversible decisions made in foregoing eras. To\nunderstand effects of sequences of decision-making and\ninteractions/dependencies between decisions made, we conduct a series of\nexperiments. More precisely, we fix a set of decision-maker preferences $D$ and\nthe number of eras $n_t$ and analyze all $|D|^{n_t}$ combinations of\ndecision-maker options. We find that for random uniform instances (a) the final\nselected solutions mainly depend on the final decision and not on the decision\nhistory, (b) solutions are quite robust with respect to the number of unvisited\ndynamic customers, and (c) solutions of the dynamic approach can even dominate\nsolutions obtained by a clairvoyant EMOA.

Many variants of RNN have been proposed to solve the\ngradient problems of training RNNs and process long sequences. Although some\nclassical models have been proposed, capturing long-term dependence while\nresponding to short-term changes remains a challenge. To this problem, we\npropose a new model named Dual Recurrent Neural Networks (DuRNN). The DuRNN\nconsists of two parts to learn the short-term dependence and progressively\nlearn the long-term dependence. The first part is a recurrent neural network\nwith constrained full recurrent connections to deal with short-term dependence\nin sequence and generate short-term memory. Another part is a recurrent neural\nnetwork with independent recurrent connections which helps to learn long-term\ndependence and generate long-term memory. A selection mechanism is added\nbetween two parts to help the needed long-term information transfer to the\nindependent neurons. Multiple modules can be stacked to form a multi-layer\nmodel for better performance. Our contributions are: 1) a new recurrent model\ndeveloped based on the divide-and-conquer strategy to learn long and short-term\ndependence separately, and 2) a selection mechanism to enhance the separating\nand learning of different temporal scales of dependence. Both theoretical\nanalysis and extensive experiments are conducted to validate the performance of\nour model, and we also conduct simple visualization experiments and ablation\nanalyses for the model interpretability. Experimental results indicate that the\nproposed DuRNN model can handle not only very long sequences (over 5000 time\nsteps), but also short sequences very well.

However, we note that the range of the learned\ncontext progressively increases from the lower to upper self-attention layers,\nwhilst acoustic events often happen within short time spans in a left-to-right\norder. This leads to a question: for speech recognition, is a global view of\nthe entire sequence still important for the upper self-attention layers in the\nencoder of Transformers? To investigate this, we replace these self-attention\nlayers with feed forward layers. In our speech recognition experiments (Wall\nStreet Journal and Switchboard), we indeed observe an interesting result:\nreplacing the upper self-attention layers in the encoder with feed forward\nlayers leads to no performance drop, and even minor gains.

Historically, this was\nlinked for semiconductor quantum wells to strong far-field optical dipole\ncoupling, or strong electronic long-range exchange interactions, describing two\nsides of the same coin. Recently, experiments utilizing Fourier-space\nspectroscopy have shown that the exciton (exciton-polariton) dispersion can\nindeed be measured for high-quality hexagonal-BN-encapsulated WSe2 monolayer\nsamples and can confirm the energy scale. Here, the exciton fine-structure's\npseudo-spin and the valley polarization are investigated as a function of the\ncentre-of-mass-momentum and excitation-laser detuning. For quasi-resonant\nexcitation, a strong dispersion featuring a pronounced momentum-dependent\nhelicity is observed. By increasing the excitation energy step-wise towards and\nthen above the electronic band gap, the dispersion and the helicity\nsystematically decrease due to contributions of incoherent excitons and\nemission from plasma. The decline of the helicity with centre-of-mass momentum\ncan be phenomenologically modelled by the Maialle-Silva-Sham mechanism using\nthe exciton splitting as the source of an effective magnetic field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 May 2020 10:55:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-29"}

Recently, Li (2018) reported evaporation-triggered segregation in\n1,2-hexanediol-water binary droplets. In this present work, we added 0.5 wt%\nsilicone oil into the 1,2-hexanediol-water binary solution. This minute\nsilicone oil concentration dramatically modifies the evaporation process as it\ntriggers an early extraction of the 1,2-hexanediol from the mixture.\nSurprisingly, we observe that the segregation of 1,2-hexanediol forms plumes,\nrising up from the rim of the sessile droplet towards the apex during the\ndroplet evaporation. By orientating the droplet upside down, i.e., by studying\na pendant droplet, the absence of the plumes indicates that the flow structure\nis induced by buoyancy, which drives a Rayleigh-Taylor instability (i.e.,\ndriven by density differences & gravitational acceleration). From micro-PIV\nmeasurement, we further prove that the segregation of the non-volatile\ncomponent (1,2-hexanediol) hinders the evaporation near the contact line, which\nleads to a suppression of the Marangoni flow in this region. Hence, on long\ntime scales, gravitational effects play the dominant role in the flow\nstructure, rather than Marangoni flows. We compare the measurement of the\nevaporation rate with the diffusion model of Popov (2005), coupled with\nRaoult's law and the activity coefficient. This comparison indeed confirms that\nthe silicone-oil-triggered segregation of the non-volatile 1,2-hexanediol\nsignificantly delays the evaporation. With an extended diffusion model, in\nwhich the influence of the segregation has been implemented, the evaporation\ncan be well described.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 May 2020 11:08:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

Combined with the exquisitely\nlow intrinsic dissipation of superfluid helium and the strongly suppressed\nacoustic radiation loss in phononic crystal cavities, we predict that this\ncould allow blockade interactions between phonons as well as\ntwo-level-system-like behavior. Our work provides a new pathway towards extreme\nmechanical nonlinearities, and towards quantum devices that use mechanical\nresonators as qubits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 May 2020 11:29:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Nov 2020 04:22:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-11"}

In spite of the number of cases of\nCOVID-19, its rapid spread putting many sanitary systems in the edge of\ncollapse has hindered proper collection and analysis of the data related to\nCOVID-19 clinical aspects. We describe an interdisciplinary initiative that\nintegrates clinical research, with image diagnostics and the use of new\ntechnologies such as artificial intelligence and radiomics with the aim of\nclarifying some of SARS-CoV-2 open questions. The whole initiative addresses 3\nmain points: 1) collection of standardize data including images, clinical data\nand analytics; 2) COVID-19 screening for its early diagnosis at primary care\ncenters; 3) define radiomic signatures of COVID-19 evolution and associated\npathologies for the early treatment of complications. In particular, in this\npaper we present a general overview of the project, the experimental design and\nfirst results of X-ray COVID-19 detection using a classic approach based on HoG\nand feature selection. Our experiments include a comparison to some recent\nmethods for COVID-19 screening in X-Ray and an exploratory analysis of the\nfeasibility of X-Ray COVID-19 screening. Results show that classic approaches\ncan outperform deep-learning methods in this experimental setting, indicate the\nfeasibility of early COVID-19 screening and that non-COVID infiltration is the\ngroup of patients most similar to COVID-19 in terms of radiological description\nof X-ray.

It is constructed based on the direct modeling of\nmulti-scale flow behaviors, which is used in the Gas-Kinetic Scheme (GKS), the\nUnified Gas-Kinetic Scheme (UGKS), the Discrete Unified Gas-Kinetic Scheme\n(DUGKS), etc.. In KIF, the discontinuities (such as the shock wave) that can\nnot be well resolved by mesh cells are mainly solved by the Kinetic Flux Vector\nSplitting (KFVS) method representing the free transport mechanism (or\nmicro-scale mechanism), while in other flow regions that are smooth, the flow\nbehavior is solved mainly by the central-scheme-like Totally Thermalized\nTransport (TTT). The weights of KFVS and TTT in KIF is automatically determined\nby those in the theory of direct modeling. Two ways of choosing the weights in\nKIF are proposed, which are actually the weights adopted in the UGKS and the\nDUGKS, respectively. By using the test cases of Sod shock tube, rarefaction\nwave, the boundary layer of flat plate, the cavity flow and hypersonic flow\nover circular cylinder, the validity and accuracy of the present method are\nexamined. The KIF does not suffer from the carbuncle phenomenon, and does not\nintroduce extra numerical viscosity in smooth regions. Especially, in the case\nof hypersonic cylinder, it gives a quite sharp and clear density and\ntemperature contours. The KIF can be viewed as an inviscid-viscous splitting\nversion of the GKS. By the doing this splitting, it is easy to be used in the\ntraditional CFD frameworks. It can also be classified as a new type in the\nnumerical schemes based on the kinetic theory that are represented by the works\nin Ref. \\cite{SunA} and Ref. \\cite{ohwada2018a}, except the weights are\ndetermined by the weights of direct modeling.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 May 2020 12:26:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-23"}

We propose a new\ndomain adaptation method based on prototype construction which likes capturing\ndata cluster centers. Specifically, it consists of two parts: disentanglement\nand reconstruction. First, the domain specific features and domain invariant\nfeatures are disentangled from the original features. At the same time, the\ndomain prototypes and class prototypes of both domains are estimated. Then, a\nreconstructor is trained by reconstructing the original features from the\ndisentangled domain invariant features and domain specific features. By this\nreconstructor, we can construct prototypes for the original features using\nclass prototypes and domain prototypes correspondingly. In the end, the feature\nextraction network is forced to extract features close to these prototypes.

In\nZF, the domain of discourse contains only sets, and hence every mathematical\nobject must be a set. Consequently, in ZF, with the usual encoding of an\nordered pair ${\\langle a, b\\rangle}$, formulas like ${\\{a\\} \\in \\langle a, b\n\\rangle}$ have truth values, and operations like ${\\mathcal P (\\langle a,\nb\\rangle)}$ have results that are sets. Such 'accidental theorems' do not match\nhow people think about the mathematics and also cause practical difficulties\nwhen using set theory in machine-assisted theorem proving. In contrast, in a\nnumber of proof assistants, mathematical objects and concepts can be built of\ntype-theoretic stuff so that many mathematical objects can be, in essence,\nterms of an extended typed ${\\lambda}$-calculus. However, dilemmas and\nfrustration arise when formalizing mathematics in type theory.\n  Motivated by problems of formalizing mathematics with (1) purely\nset-theoretic and (2) type-theoretic approaches, we explore an option with much\nof the flexibility of set theory and some of the useful features of type\ntheory.

ZFP has a more natural and abstract axiomatic\ndefinition of ordered pairs free of any notion of representation. This paper\npresents axioms for ZFP, and a proof in ZF (machine-checked in Isabelle/ZF) of\nthe existence of a model for ZFP, which implies that ZFP is consistent if ZF\nis.

Indeed, although zero temperature is often accompanied by simpler\nmathematics, the richness in physical results is evident when one considers the\nsystem to have temperature and even more so if the background geometry is\ncurved. This thesis will be dedicated to the study of this type of physical\nsystems, where thermodynamics and general relativity equally contribute to the\ndynamics. The first part will be devoted to the study of classical\nthermodynamic systems in curved spacetime, namely thin matter shells at finite\ntemperature. These objects partition spacetime into separate pieces, and their\nvery existence is conditioned by the so-called junctions conditions. The latter\nconditions allow us to carefully study both the mechanical and thermodynamics\nof the shell and, in particular, they give rise to a well-defined notion of\nentropy. The shell can then be taken to its black hole limit, providing an\nalternative way to study black hole thermodynamics. We will do this for\ndifferent geometries, obtaining as byproduct a plausible answer for the debated\nvalue of the entropy of an extremal black hole. In the second part we shall\nreview the standard formalisms to study QFT in curved spacetimes, in order to\nexplore quantum properties of thermodynamic systems in the presence of gravity.\nMassive quantum scalar fields at finite temperature will be the systems of\nchoice, whereby various instances of vacuum polarisation will be calculated in\na variety of black hole geometries. Both numerical and analytic results will be\nobtained, and new addition formulas for a certain class of transcendental\nfunctions will be derived. This part will culminate with a careful numerical\nstudy of symmetry restoration of a self-interacting scalar field around a\ncharged black hole, where we verify insights present in the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 May 2020 13:10:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-29"}

Such analyses provide new insights into these game\ndynamical systems, which seem hard to achieve via the classical techniques\nwithin Computer Science and Machine Learning.\n  The first step is to examine these dynamics not in their original space\n(simplex of actions) but in a dual space (aggregate payoff space of actions).\nThe second step is to explore how the volume of a set of initial conditions\nevolves over time when it is pushed forward according to the algorithm. This is\nreminiscent of approaches in Evolutionary Game Theory where replicator\ndynamics, the continuous-time analogue of MWU, is known to always preserve\nvolume in all games. Interestingly, when we examine discrete-time dynamics,\nboth the choice of the game and the choice of the algorithm play a critical\nrole.

Existing approaches largely\nsolve this problem using a blackbox-application of a heavy-duty generative\nlearning technique, such as sequence-to-sequence prediction (TRACER) or\nreinforcement learning (RLAssist). Although convenient, such black-box\napplication of learning techniques makes existing approaches bulky in terms of\ntraining time, as well as inefficient at targeting specific error types.\n  We present MACER, a novel technique for accelerated error repair based on a\nmodular segregation of the repair process into repair identification and repair\napplication.

On a benchmark dataset of 4K buggy programs collected from actual\nstudent submissions, MACER outperforms existing methods by 20% at suggesting\nfixes for popular errors that exactly match the fix desired by the student.\nMACER is also competitive or better than existing methods at all error types --\nwhether popular or rare.

Significantly simplified equations of motion, called\ntoy-models, are traditionally employed in the analysis of such complex systems.\nIn such models, equations are modified preserving just a part of the structure\nbelieved to be important. Here we propose a different approach for constructing\nsimplified models, in which instead of simplifying equations one introduces a\nsimplified configuration space: velocity fields are defined on\nmulti-dimensional logarithmic lattices with proper algebraic operations and\ncalculus. Then, the equations of motion retain their exact original form and,\ntherefore, naturally maintain most scaling properties, symmetries and\ninvariants of the original systems.

Charging and discharging dynamics of the quantum\nbattery, subjected to a static driving, are obtained exploiting a proper\nmapping into the so-called spin-boson model. Analytic expressions for the time\nevolution of the energy stored in the weak coupling regime are presented\nrelying on a systematic weak damping expansion. Here, decoherence and pure\ndephasing dissipative coupling are discussed in details. We argue that the\nformer results in better charging performances, showing also interesting\nfeatures reminiscent of the Lamb shift level splitting renormalization induced\nby the presence of the reservoir. Charging stability is also addressed, by\nmonitoring the energy behaviour after the charging protocol has been switched\noff. This study presents a general framework to investigate relaxation effects,\nable to include also non Markovian effects, and it reveals the importance of\ncontrolling and, possibly, engineering system-bath coupling in the realization\nof quantum batteries.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 May 2020 14:11:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-03"}

To confirm our intuition we\nperform an MCMC analysis for three representative cases and find indeed that\n$H_0$ is significantly larger than in $\\Lambda$CDM like in other EDE models.\nUnlike axion-driven EDE models with super Planckian decay constant, the\ncurvature of EDE models required by the data is natural in the context of\nrecent theoretical developments in $\\alpha$-attractors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 May 2020 14:34:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Sep 2020 07:06:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-14"}

In the present\nwork we perform 2D hydrodynamical simulations of protoplanetary discs where the\nopacity is self-consistently calculated for the dust population, taking into\naccount the particle size, composition and abundance. We first compare\nsimulations using single grain sizes to two different multi-grain size\ndistributions at different levels of turbulence strengths, parameterized\nthrough the $\\alpha$-viscosity, and different gas surface densities. Assuming a\nsingle dust size leads to inaccurate calculations of the thermal structure of\ndiscs, because the grain size dominating the opacity increases with orbital\nradius. Overall the two grain size distributions, one limited by fragmentation\nonly and the other determined from a more complete fragmentation-coagulation\nequilibrium, give similar results for the thermal structure. We find that both\ngrain size distributions give less steep opacity gradients that result in less\nsteep aspect ratio gradients, in comparison to discs with only micrometer sized\ndust. Moreover, in the discs with a grain size distribution, the innermost\noutward migration region is removed and planets embedded is such discs\nexperience lower migration rates.

We show that an\nRNN of depth four and width depending quadratically on the profit of an optimum\nKnapsack solution is sufficient to find optimum Knapsack solutions.

The effect of size and compositions\nof nanoparticle on the coating with HCQ and CQ have obtained and proposed the\nappropriate candidate for drug delivery. This kind of modeling could help the\nexperimental groups to find the efficient and safe therapies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 28 May 2020 13:40:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-26"}

Using the\nanalytical work of Schoenberg (2019) to select what to include in a compressed\nmodel, this paper demonstrates how that information can be clearly presented in\nan automatically generated causal loop diagram. The diagrams are generated\nusing tools developed by people working in graph theory and the generated\ndiagrams are clear and aesthetically pleasing. This approach can also be built\nupon to generate stock and flow diagrams. Automated stock and flow diagram\ngeneration opens the door to representing models developed using only\nequations, regardless or origin, in a clear and easy to understand way. Because\nmodels can be large, the application of grouping techniques, again developed\nfor graph theory, can help structure the resulting diagrams in the most usable\nform. This paper describes the algorithms developed for automated diagram\ngeneration and shows a number of examples of their uses in large models. The\napplication of these techniques to existing, but inaccessible, equation-based\nmodels can help broaden the knowledge base for System Dynamics modeling. The\ntechniques can also be used to improve layout in all, or part, of existing\nmodels with diagrammatic informtion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 27 May 2020 22:32:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-16"}

We show in this paper\nthe necessity of including loops that are important at different points in the\nsimulation. These important loops may not be independent of one another and\ncannot be determined from static analysis of the model structure. We then\ndescribe an algorithm that can be used to discover the most important loops in\nmodels that are too feedback rich for exhaustive loop discovery.
