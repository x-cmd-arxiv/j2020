Metric bundles, first introduced in [21]\ncan be generally defined for axially symmetric spacetimes with Killing horizons\nand, for the case of Kerr geometries, are sets of black holes (BHs) or black\nholes and naked singularities (NSs) geometries. Each metric of a bundle has an\nequal limiting photon (orbital) frequency, which defines the bundle and\ncoincides with the frequency of a Killing horizon in the extended plane. In\nthis plane each bundle is represented as a curve tangent to the curve that\nrepresents the horizons, which thus emerge as the envelope surfaces of the\nmetric bundles. We show that the horizons frequency can be used to establish a\nconnection between BHs and NSs, providing an alternative representation of such\nspacetimes in the extended plane and an alternative definition of the BH\nhorizons. We introduce the concept of inner horizon confinement and horizons\nreplicas and study the possibility of detecting their frequencies. We study the\nbundle characteristic frequencies constraining the inner horizon confinement in\nthe outer region of the plane i.e. the possibility of detect frequency related\nto the inner horizon, and the horizons replicas, structures which may be\ndetectable, for example, from the emission spectra of BHs spacetimes.

We argue that these results could be\nused to further investigate black holes and their thermodynamic properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 8 May 2020 16:15:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-11"}

This work tackles with great detail how chaotic signals\nand their information content are affected when travelling through medium that\npresents the non-ideal properties of multipath propagation, noise and chaotic\ninterference (linear superposition), and how this impacts on the proposed\ncommunication system.

To be a valid model of a system, the graph structure must\nsatisfy a number of constraints. To date, consistency has primarily been viewed\nas a binary property: a graph either is or is not consistent with respect to a\nset of graph constraints. This has enabled the definition of notions such as\nconstraint-preserving and constraint-guaranteeing graph transformations. Many\npractical applications - for example model repair or evolutionary search -\nimplicitly assume a more graduated notion of consistency, but without an\nexplicit formalisation only limited analysis of these applications is possible.\nIn this paper, we introduce an explicit notion of consistency as a graduated\nproperty, depending on the number of constraint violations in a graph. We\npresent two new characterisations of transformations (and transformation rules)\nenabling reasoning about the gradual introduction of consistency: while\nconsistency-sustaining transformations do not decrease the consistency level,\nconsistency-improving transformations strictly reduce the number of constraint\nviolations. We show how these new definitions refine the existing concepts of\nconstraint-preserving and constraint-guaranteeing transformations. To support a\nstatic analysis based on our characterisations, we present criteria for\ndeciding which form of consistency ensuring transformations is induced by the\napplication of a transformation rule.

Methods: We\ngenerated black-box and interpretable ML models on two different criminal\nrecidivism datasets from Florida and Kentucky.

Previous backup placement algorithms suffer from obliviousness to main\nfactors of real-world heterogeneous wireless network. Specifically, there is no\nconsideration of the nodes memory and storage capacities, and no reference to a\ncase in which nodes have different energy capacity, and thus can leave (or\njoin) the network at any time. These parameters are strongly correlated in\nwireless networks, as the load on different parts of the network can differ\ngreatly, thus requiring more communication, energy, memory and storage. In\norder to fit the real-world attributes of wireless networks, this work\naddresses a generalized version of the original problem, namely $K$-Backup\nPlacement, in which each vertex selects $K$ neighbors, for a positive parameter\n$K$. Our $K$-Backup Placement algorithm terminates within just one round. In\naddition we suggest two complementary algorithms which employ\n$K$-Backup-Placement to obtain efficient virtual memory schemes for wireless\nnetworks. The first algorithm divides the memory of each node to many small\nparts.

In\nthis paper, we examine using N-body simulations how the properties of planetary\nsystems are determined during the final stages of assembly. While accretion is\na chaotic process, trends in the ensemble properties of planetary systems\nprovide a memory of the initial distribution of solid mass around a star prior\nto accretion.

We show that the\nperiod of the innermost planet, the ratio of orbital periods of adjacent\nplanets, and masses of the planets are determined by the total mass and radial\ndistribution of embryos and planetesimals at the beginning of accretion. In\ngeneral, some amount of orbital damping, either via planetesimals or gas,\nduring accretion is needed to match the whole population of exoplanets.\nSurprisingly, all simulated planetary systems have planets that are similar in\nsize, showing that the \"peas in a pod\" pattern can be consistent with both a\ngiant impact scenario and a planet migration scenario.

In particular, the de Sitter isometries become\nconformal symmetries on the future boundary of the spacetime, which are\nreflected in a set of Ward identities that the boundary correlators must\nsatisfy. We solve these Ward identities by acting with weight-shifting\noperators on scalar seed solutions. Using this weight-shifting approach, we\nderive three- and four-point correlators of massless spin-1 and spin-2 fields\nwith conformally coupled scalars. Four-point functions arising from tree-level\nexchange are singular in particular kinematic configurations, and the\ncoefficients of these singularities satisfy certain factorization properties.\nWe show that in many cases these factorization limits fix the structure of the\ncorrelators uniquely, without having to solve the conformal Ward identities.\nThe additional constraint of locality for massless spinning particles manifests\nitself as current conservation on the boundary. We find that the four-point\nfunctions only satisfy current conservation if the s, t, and u-channels are\nrelated to each other, leading to nontrivial constraints on the couplings\nbetween the conserved currents and other operators in the theory.

In this paper we have achieved a thorough\nunderstanding for few special cases of these non-WF kinks. The first case is\nthe $O(4)$ bootstrap in 2d, where the non-WF kink turns out to be the $SU(2)_1$\nWess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) model, and all the $SU(2)_{k>2}$ WZW models saturate\nthe numerical bound on the left side of the kink.

But the\neffectively linear interaction between motion and light or electricity\nprecludes access to the broader class of quantum states of motion, such as cat\nstates or energy squeezed states. Indeed, early optomechanical proposals noted\nthe possibility to escape this restriction by creating strong quadratic\ncoupling of motion to light. Although there have been experimental\ndemonstrations of quadratically coupled optomechanical systems, these have not\nyet accessed nonclassical states of motion.

However, this approach ignores the potential heterogeneity\nin dose-response curves between schedules. A more reasonable approach is the\npartial pooling, i.e. certain parameters of the dose-response curves are\nshared, while others are allowed to vary. Rather than using schedule-specific\nfixed-effects, we propose a Bayesian hierarchical model with random-effects to\nmodel the between-schedule heterogeneity with regard to certain parameters.\nSchedule-specific dose-response relationships can then be estimated using\nshrinkage estimation.

Using data from Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) of the forced\nNavier-Stokes equation, we consider the relative importance of local and\nnon-local terms in the FVGT eigenframe equations across the scales using\nstatistical analysis. The analysis of the eigenframe rotation-rate, that drives\nvorticity tilting, shows that the anisotropic pressure Hessian plays a key\nrole, with the sub-grid stress making an important contribution outside the\ndissipation range, and the local spinning due to vorticity making a much\nsmaller contribution.

From a modeling perspective, knowledge patterns\nprovide an important insight into the structure of a formal ontology: rather\nthan viewing a formal ontology simply as a list of terms and axioms, knowledge\npatterns views it as a collection of abstract, modular theories (the \"knowledge\npatterns\") plus a collection of modeling decisions stating how different\naspects of the world can be modeled using those theories.

The linear stability analysis of the firehose modes is carried out\nin the incompressible limit, where the MHD flow is parallel to the background\nmagnetic field, while the velocity is sheared in the direction transverse to\nthe flow direction. It seems that an increase of the velocity shear parameter\nleads to higher growth rates of the firehose instability. The increase of the\ninstability growth rate is most profound for perturbations with oblique\nwave-numbers $k_{\\perp}/k_{\\parallel} < 1$. The heat flux parameter introduces\nan asymmetry of the instability growth in the shear plane: perturbations with\nwave-vectors with a component in the direction of the velocity shear grow\nsignificantly stronger as compared to those with components in the opposite\ndirection.

To address this, we propose a general\ncomputational framework for adapting to novel tasks based on their relationship\nto prior tasks. We begin by learning vector representations of tasks. To adapt\nto new tasks, we propose meta-mappings, higher-order tasks that transform basic\ntask representations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework across\na wide variety of tasks and computational paradigms, ranging from regression to\nimage classification and reinforcement learning. We compare to both human\nadaptability and language-based approaches to zero-shot learning. Across these\ndomains, meta-mapping is successful, often achieving 80-90% performance,\nwithout any data, on a novel task, even when the new task directly contradicts\nprior experience. We further show that meta-mapping can not only generalize to\nnew tasks via learned relationships, but can also generalize using novel\nrelationships unseen during training. Finally, using meta-mapping as a starting\npoint can dramatically accelerate later learning on a new task, and reduce\nlearning time and cumulative error substantially.

But can\nidentity effects be learned from the data without explicit guidance? We provide\na simple framework in which we can rigorously prove that algorithms satisfying\nsimple criteria cannot make the correct inference.

One of the remedies to privacy breach incidents is to encapsulate\ncomputations over sensitive data within hardware-assisted Trusted Execution\nEnvironments (TEE). Such TEE-powered software is called secure enclaves. Secure\nenclaves hold various advantages against competing for privacy-preserving\ncomputation solutions. However, enclaves are much more challenging to build\ncompared with ordinary software. The reason is that the development of TEE\nsoftware must follow a restrictive programming model to make effective use of\nstrong memory encryption and segregation enforced by hardware. These\nconstraints transitively apply to all third-party dependencies of the software.\nIf these dependencies do not officially support TEE hardware, TEE developers\nhave to spend additional engineering effort in porting them. High development\nand maintenance cost is one of the major obstacles against adopting TEE-based\nprivacy protection solutions in production. In this paper, we present our\nexperience and achievements with regard to constructing and continuously\nmaintaining a third-party library supply chain for TEE developers. In\nparticular, we port a large collection of Rust third-party libraries into Intel\nSGX, one of the most mature trusted computing platforms. Our supply chain\naccepts upstream patches in a timely manner with SGX-specific security\nauditing. We have been able to maintain the SGX ports of 159 open-source Rust\nlibraries with reasonable operational costs. Our work can effectively reduce\nthe engineering cost of developing SGX enclaves for privacy-preserving data\nprocessing and exchange.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 May 2020 05:19:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-12"}

To this aim, we solve the initial value problem for the incompressible\nlinearized viscous MHD equations in a radially inhomogeneous flux tube in the\nlimit of long wavelengths. Using a modal expansion technique the\nspatio-temporal behavior of the perturbations is obtained. We confirm that for\nlarge Reynolds numbers representative of the coronal plasma the decrement in\nthe amplitude of the kink oscillations is due to the resonant absorption\nmechanism that converts the global transverse oscillation to rotational motions\nin the inhomogeneous layer of the flux tube. We show that viscosity suppresses\nthe rate of phase mixing of the perturbations in the inhomogeneous region of\nthe flux tube and prevents the continuous building up of small scales in the\nsystem once a sufficiently small scale is reached. The viscous dissipation\nfunction is calculated to investigate plasma heating by viscosity in the\ninhomogeneous layer of the flux tube. For Reynolds numbers of the order of\n10^6-10^8, the energy of the kink wave is transformed into heat in two to eight\nperiods of the kink oscillation. For larger and more realistic Reynolds\nnumbers, heating happens, predominantly, after the global kink oscillation is\ndamped, and no significant heating occurs during the observable transverse\nmotion of the flux tube.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 May 2020 08:01:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-12"}

This is especially true for small or micro UAVs, due to their\nlimited computational power. In nature, flying insects with compact and simple\nvisual systems demonstrate their remarkable ability to navigate and avoid\ncollision in complex environments. A good example of this is provided by\nlocusts. They can avoid collisions in a dense swarm through the activity of a\nmotion based visual neuron called the Lobula Giant Movement Detector (LGMD).\nThe defining feature of the LGMD neuron is its preference for looming. As a\nflying insect's visual neuron, LGMD is considered to be an ideal basis for\nbuilding UAV's collision detecting system. However, existing LGMD models cannot\ndistinguish looming clearly from other visual cues such as complex background\nmovements caused by UAV agile flights. To address this issue, we proposed a new\nmodel implementing distributed spatial-temporal synaptic interactions, which is\ninspired by recent findings in locusts' synaptic morphology. We first\nintroduced the locally distributed excitation to enhance the excitation caused\nby visual motion with preferred velocities. Then radially extending temporal\nlatency for inhibition is incorporated to compete with the distributed\nexcitation and selectively suppress the non-preferred visual motions.\nSystematic experiments have been conducted to verify the performance of the\nproposed model for UAV agile flights.

The balance between within- and\namong-collective evolution thus exerts profound impacts on the fitness of these\nsystems. Here, we investigate how this balance depends on the size of a\ncollective (denoted by $N$) and the mutation rate of components ($m$) through\nmathematical analyses and computer simulations of multiple population genetics\nmodels. We first confirm a previous result that increasing $N$ or $m$\naccelerates within-collective evolution relative to among-collective evolution,\nthus promoting the evolution of cheating. Moreover, we show that when within-\nand among-collective evolution exactly balance each other out, the following\nscaling relation generally holds: $Nm^{\\alpha}$ is a constant, where scaling\nexponent $\\alpha$ depends on multiple parameters, such as the strength of\nselection and whether altruism is a binary or quantitative trait.

Arranging transportation could spike the number\nof COVID-19 infected cases. Hence, this paper investigates the potential surge\nin confirmed and active cases of COVID-19 infection and assesses the train and\nbus fleet size required for the repatriating migrant workers. The expected to\nrepatriate migrant worker population was obtained by forecasting the 2011\ncensus data and comparing it with the information reported in the news media. A\nmodified susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) model was proposed to\nestimate the surge in confirmed and active cases of COVID-19 patients in\nIndia's selected states with high outflux of migrants. The developed model\nconsidered combinations of different levels of the daily arrival rate of\nmigrant workers, total migrant workers in need of transportation, and the\norigin of the trip dependent symptomatic cases on arrival. Reducing the daily\narrival rate of migrant workers for states with very high outflux of migrants\n(i.e., Uttar Pradesh and Bihar) can help to lower the surge in confirmed and\nactive cases. Nevertheless, it could create a disparity in the number of days\nneeded to transport all repatriating migrant workers to the home states. Hence,\ntravel arrangements for about 100,000 migrant workers per day to Uttar Pradesh\nand Bihar, about 50,000 per day to Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, 20,000 per day\nto Maharashtra and less than 20,000 per day to other states of India was\nrecommended.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 May 2020 12:24:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 30 Jul 2020 18:01:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-03"}

The TFAN-based method\nwas trained on 50 recordings randomly chosen from Training set A of the 2016\nPhysioNet/Computer in Cardiology Challenge and tested on the other 12\nindependent training and test databases (2099 recordings and 52180 beats). The\ndatabases for segmentation were separated into three levels of increasing\ndifficulty (LEVEL-I, -II and -III) for performance reporting. Results: The\nTFAN-based method achieved a superior F1 score for all 12 databases except for\n`Test-B', with an average of 96.7%, compared to 94.6% for the state-of-the-art\nmethod. Moreover, the TFAN-based method achieved an overall F1 score of 99.2%,\n94.4%, 91.4% on LEVEL-I, -II and -III data respectively, compared to 98.4%,\n88.54% and 79.80% for the current state-of-the-art method. Conclusion: The\nTFAN-based method therefore provides a substantial improvement, particularly\nfor more difficult cases, and on data sets not represented in the public\ntraining data. Significance: The proposed method is highly flexible and likely\nto apply to other non-stationary time series. Further work is required to\nunderstand to what extent this approach will provide improved diagnostic\nperformance, although it is logical to assume superior segmentation will lead\nto improved diagnostics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 May 2020 12:32:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 12 Jul 2020 02:48:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 16 Jul 2020 03:33:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-21"}

However, the distance at which they can surpass the nominal key rate\nof repeaterless systems, in terms of bits per second, is typically long, owing\nto the efficiency and/or interaction time issues when one deals with quantum\nmemories. This crossover distance can be a few hundred kilometres, for\ninstance, when one relies on the exchange of infinitely many key bits for the\nkey-rate analysis.

Current implementations of this handover in automobiles take the form\nof a generic alarm indicating an imminent transfer of control back to the human\ndriver. However, certain levels of vehicle autonomy may allow the driver to\nengage in other, non-driving related tasks prior to a handover, leading to\nsubstantial difficulty in quickly regaining situational awareness. This delay\nin re-orientation could potentially lead to life-threatening failures unless\nmitigating steps are taken. Explainable AI has been shown to improve fluency\nand teamwork in human-robot collaboration scenarios. Therefore, we hypothesize\nthat by utilizing autonomous explanation, these car-to-driver handovers can be\nperformed more safely and reliably. The rationale is, by providing the driver\nwith additional situational knowledge, they will more rapidly focus on the\nrelevant parts of the driving environment. Towards this end, we propose an\nalgorithmic failure-mode identification and explanation approach to enable\ninformed handovers from vehicle to driver. Furthermore, we propose a set of\nhuman-subjects driving-simulator studies to determine the appropriate form of\nexplanation during handovers, as well as validate our framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 May 2020 13:16:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-12"}

The different scenarios stem from linear stability theory and\ncomprise exponential instabilities, neutral modes, transient growth from\nnon-normal operators, and parametric instabilities from temporal mean-flow\nvariations, among others. These mechanisms, each potentially capable of leading\nto the observed turbulence structure, are rooted in theoretical and conceptual\narguments.

Here, we evaluate the linear mechanisms responsible for the energy\ntransfer from the streamwise-averaged mean-flow ($\\bf U$) to the fluctuating\nvelocities ($\\bf u'$). We use cause-and-effect analysis based on interventions.\nThis is achieved by direct numerical simulation of turbulent channel flows at\nlow Reynolds number, in which the energy transfer from $\\bf U$ to $\\bf u'$ is\nconstrained to preclude a targeted linear mechanism. We show that transient\ngrowth is sufficient for sustaining realistic wall turbulence. Self-sustaining\nturbulence persists when exponential instabilities, neutral modes, and\nparametric instabilities of the mean flow are suppressed. We further show that\na key component of transient growth is the Orr/push-over mechanism induced by\nspanwise variations of the base flow.

An important result of the study is the\njustification of CMODS selection criteria (variability, accessibility, tooling,\ninteractivity, intuition, complexity, data visuality, scientific ground of\nmodels, independence, realism); forms and methods of applying CMODS in the\neducational process, allocating the aspect of cognitive tasks application\n(research, creative, applied) for the students competences formation; the\njustification of such forms of evaluation as reflection, formative evaluation,\nfinal evaluation. Computer modeling systems become an alternative to\nconventional drawings in paper course books and posters. Imitation processes,\ninteractive exercises of various types, animation support as well as formative\nassessment give each student the opportunity of developing competence and\nexploring the world with enthusiasm. The use of CMODS diversifies the process\nof obtaining knowledge, allows transfer from passive to active teaching\nmethods, activates educational and cognitive activity of students, as well as\nthe creation of an individual trajectory for development for each student in\nthe process of studying natural and mathematical subjects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 9 May 2020 15:38:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-18"}

We start by presenting\npreliminary results obtained by training an LSTM SAE network, which are\nsomewhat disappointing.

A\nModified Auto-Encoder network is then trained from these clusters and learns to\npredict future data for Brazilian states. These predictions are used to\nestimate important statistics about the disease, such as peaks. Finally, curve\nfitting is carried out on the predictions in order to find the distribution\nthat best fits the outputs of the MAE, and to refine the estimates of the peaks\nof the pandemic.
