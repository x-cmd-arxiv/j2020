Despite\nextensive studies on both opinion dynamics and appraisal dynamics separately,\nno previous work has ever combined these two processes together. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel and intuitive model on the interplay between homophily-based\nappraisal dynamics and influence-based opinion dynamics. We assume that\nindividuals' opinions are updated via the influence network constructed from\ntheir interpersonal appraisals, which are in turn updated based on the\nindividual opinions via the homophily mechanism. By theoretical analysis, we\ncharacterize the set of equilibria and some transient behavior of our model.\nMoreover, we establish the equivalence among the convergence of the appraisal\nnetwork to social balance, the modulus consensus of individual opinions, and\nthe non-vanishing appraisals. Monte Carlo validations further show that the\nnon-vanishing appraisals condition holds for generic initial conditions.\nCompared with previous works that explain the emergence of social balance via\nperson-to-person homophily mechanism, our model provides an alternative\nexplanation in terms of the person-to-entity homophily mechanism. In addition,\nour model also describes how individuals' opinions on multiple irrelevant\nissues become correlated and converge to modulus consensus over time-varying\ninfluence networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 May 2020 16:00:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-25"}

A matrix has the $(s,\\delta)$-$\\mathsf{RIP}$ property if behaves as a\n$\\delta$-approximate isometry on $s$-sparse vectors. It is well known that an\n$M\\times N$ matrix with i.i.d. $\\mathcal{N}(0,1/M)$ entries is\n$(s,\\delta)$-$\\mathsf{RIP}$ with high probability as long as $s\\lesssim\n\\delta^2 M/\\log N$. On the other hand, most prior works aiming to\ndeterministically construct $(s,\\delta)$-$\\mathsf{RIP}$ matrices have failed\nwhen $s \\gg \\sqrt{M}$. An alternative way to find an RIP matrix could be to\ndraw a random gaussian matrix and certify that it is indeed RIP. However, there\nis evidence that this certification task is computationally hard when $s \\gg\n\\sqrt{M}$, both in the worst case and the average case.\n  In this paper, we investigate the exact average-case time complexity of\ncertifying the RIP property for $M\\times N$ matrices with i.i.d.\n$\\mathcal{N}(0,1/M)$ entries, in the \"possible but hard\" regime $\\sqrt{M} \\ll\ns\\lesssim M/\\log N$.

This lower bound is essentially\ntight, matching the runtime of an existing algorithm due to Koiran and Zouzias.\nOur hardness result allows $\\delta$ to take any constant value in $(0,1)$,\nwhich captures the relevant regime for compressed sensing.

Most existing pruning methods either train from scratch with a\nsparsity inducing term such as group lasso, or prune redundant channels in a\npretrained network and then fine tune the network. Both strategies suffer from\nsome limitations: the use of group lasso is computationally expensive,\ndifficult to converge and often suffers from worse behavior due to the\nregularization bias. The methods that start with a pretrained network either\nprune channels uniformly across the layers or prune channels based on the basic\nstatistics of the network parameters. These approaches either ignore the fact\nthat some CNN layers are more redundant than others or fail to adequately\nidentify the level of redundancy in different layers.

Approximating these integrals is\nhard, due in part to the difficulty of locating and sampling from regions of\nthe integration domain that make significant contributions to the overall\nintegral. Here, we present a new algorithm called Tree Quadrature (TQ) that\nseparates this sampling problem from the problem of using those samples to\nproduce an approximation of the integral. TQ places no qualifications on how\nthe samples provided to it are obtained, allowing it to use state-of-the-art\nsampling algorithms that are largely ignored by existing integration\nalgorithms. Given a set of samples, TQ constructs a surrogate model of the\nintegrand in the form of a regression tree, with a structure optimised to\nmaximise integral precision. The tree divides the integration domain into\nsmaller containers, which are individually integrated and aggregated to\nestimate the overall integral. Any method can be used to integrate each\nindividual container, so existing integration methods, like Bayesian Monte\nCarlo, can be combined with TQ to boost their performance. On a set of\nbenchmark problems, we show that TQ provides accurate approximations to\nintegrals in up to 15 dimensions; and in dimensions 4 and above, it outperforms\nsimple Monte Carlo and the popular Vegas method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 May 2020 17:48:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-25"}

Traditional\nepidemiological models describe this as a result of non-pharmaceutical\ninterventions that pushed the growth rate below the recovery rate. In this new\nphase of the pandemic many countries show an almost linear growth of confirmed\ncases for extended time-periods. This new containment regime is hard to explain\nby traditional models where infection numbers either grow explosively until\nherd immunity is reached, or the epidemic is completely suppressed (zero new\ncases). Here we offer an explanation of this puzzling observation based on the\nstructure of contact networks. We show that for any given transmission rate\nthere exists a critical number of social contacts, $D_c$, below which linear\ngrowth and low infection prevalence must occur. Above $D_c$ traditional\nepidemiological dynamics takes place, as e.g. in SIR-type models.

Studying the time evolution of\ndisk sizes allows us therefore to distinguish between viscous stresses or disk\nwinds as the main mechanism of disk evolution. Observationally, estimates of\nthe disk gaseous outer radius are based on the extent of the CO rotational\nemission, which, during the evolution, is also affected by the changing\nphysical and chemical conditions in the disk. We use physical-chemical DALI\nmodels to study how the extent of the CO emission changes with time in a\nviscously expanding disk and investigate to what degree this observable gas\nouter radius is a suitable tracer of viscous spreading and whether current\nobservations are consistent with viscous evolution. We find that the gas outer\nradius (R_co) measured from our models matches the expectations of a viscously\nspreading disk: R_co increases with time and for a given time R_co is larger\nfor a disk with a higher viscosity alpha_visc. However, in the extreme case\nwhere the disk mass is low (less than 10^-4 Msun) and alpha_visc is high\n(larger than 10^-2), R_co will instead decrease with time as a result of CO\nphotodissociation in the outer disk. For most disk ages R_co is up to 12x\nlarger than the characteristic size R_c of the disk, and R_co/R_c is largest\nfor the most massive disk. As a result of this difference, a simple conversion\nof R_co to alpha_visc will overestimate the true alpha_visc of the disk by up\nto an order of magnitude. We find that most observed gas outer radii in Lupus\ncan be explained using a viscously evolving disk that starts out small (R_c =\n10 AU) and has a low viscosity (alpha_visc = 10^-4 - 10^-3).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 May 2020 18:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-29"}

Spitzer measured masses for small planets at large\norbital distances using microlensing parallax. Spitzer observations of brown\ndwarfs probed their temperatures, masses, and weather patterns.

We introduce a benchmark set of four hydrogen\nmodel systems of different dimensionality and distinctive electronic\nstructures: a 1D chain, a 1D ring, a 2D triangular lattice, and a 3D\nclose-packed pyramid. To assess the ability of a computational method to\nproduce accurate and compact wave functions, we introduce the accuracy volume,\na metric that measures the number of variational parameters necessary to\nachieve a target energy error. Using this metric and the hydrogen models, we\nexamine the performance of three classical deterministic methods: i) selected\nconfiguration interaction (sCI) realized both via an a posteriori and\nvariational selection of the most important determinants, ii) rank-reduced FCI,\nobtained by an a posteriori singular value decomposition of the FCI tensor\n(SVD-FCI), and iii) the matrix product state representation obtained via the\ndensity matrix renormalization group (DMRG). We find that DMRG generally gives\nthe most efficient wave function representation for all systems, particularly\nin the 1D chain with a localized basis. For the 2D and 3D systems, all methods\nperform best with a delocalized basis, and the efficiency of sCI is closer to\nthat of DMRG, with the former having and accuracy volume approximately twice as\nlarge in the strong correlation regime.

To deal with these problems, there has been a\nlarge body of research into teaching machines to learn to classify images based\non only a handful of training examples, a field known as few-shot learning.\nFew-shot learning research traditionally makes the simplifying assumption that\nall images belong to one of a fixed number of previously seen groups.

While there exists a rich body of work on active learning in\nthis general form, in this paper, we focus on problems with two distinguishing\ncharacteristics: severe class imbalance (skew) and small amounts of initial\ntraining data. Both of these problems occur with surprising frequency in many\nweb applications. For instance, detecting offensive or sensitive content in\nonline communities (pornography, violence, and hate-speech) is receiving\nenormous attention from industry as well as research communities. Such problems\nhave both the characteristics we describe -- a vast majority of content is not\noffensive, so the number of positive examples for such content is orders of\nmagnitude smaller than the negative examples. Furthermore, there is usually\nonly a small amount of initial training data available when building\nmachine-learned models to solve such problems. To address both these issues, we\npropose a hybrid active learning algorithm (HAL) that balances exploiting the\nknowledge available through the currently labeled training examples with\nexploring the large amount of unlabeled data available. Through simulation\nresults, we show that HAL makes significantly better choices for what points to\nlabel when compared to strong baselines like margin-sampling. Classifiers\ntrained on the examples selected for labeling by HAL easily out-perform the\nbaselines on target metrics (like area under the precision-recall curve) given\nthe same budget for labeling examples.

Therefore, digital\ncommunications have been considered due to larger spectral efficiency. Notably,\nVHF data link modes 2 and 3 (VDL2 and 3) using D8PSK modulation has been\nproposed. VDL2 and 3 received attention due to its simplicity and more constant\namplitude waveform, yielding lower PAPR. Recently, advanced VHF digital link\n(A-VDL) was proposed for VHF. This scheme enables use of essentially the same\nplatform as VDL except for the physical layer processing, including modulation.\nThe proposed A-VDL, following DVB-S2 standard, uses APSK modulation with higher\nmodulation order than VDL, hence providing higher spectral efficiency than VDL.\nCompared to the widely used QAM, APSK is more resistant to amplifier amplitude\nand phase distortions. Thus, APSK has become of interest for satellite\ncommunications, as well as VHF communications in A-VDL. In this paper, we\ninvestigate other advanced technologies such as channel encoding technique\nlow-density parity-check (LDPC), more efficient standardized voice encoders, as\nwell as better pulse shaping filters than the classical square-root\nraised-cosine filter used in VDL and A-VDL. Via simulations and analysis, we\ncompare the proposed scheme's link margin, PAPR, and spectral efficiency\ncompared to VDL and A-VDL, which both use Reed Solomon (RS) encoding. In\naddition, as another way of generating the same VDL waveforms (or possibly\nother single-carrier aeronautical band waveforms), we investigate the\nsingle-carrier type waveform used in cellular LTE and 5G uplink communication\nlinks, the discrete Fourier transform-spread OFDM (DFT-s-OFDM), and discuss how\nwe can take advantage of using the same LTE and 5G hardware resources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 May 2020 03:23:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-14"}

Here, we study the\nentanglement and EPR steering between two macroscopic magnons in a hybrid\nferrimagnet-light system. In the absence of light, the two types of magnons on\nthe two sublattices can be entangled, but no quantum steering occurs when they\nare damped with the same rates. In the presence of the cavity field, the\nentanglement can be significantly enhanced, and strong two-way asymmetric\nquantum steering appears between two magnons with equal dispassion.

The model contains two\nmodules. The first one is Context Extraction Module (CEM) that explores large\ncontextual information from multiple receptive fields. As redundant contextual\nrelations may mislead localization and recognition, we also design the second\nmodule named Attention-guided Module (AM), which can adaptively capture the\nsalient dependencies over objects by using the attention mechanism.

The\nlatter has been formally described as a Euclidean space with an orthonormal\nbasis featuring components that are suitable combinations of the original\nparts.

Thus, we produced highly\nconductive PDMS nanocomposites which were filled with multiwalled carbon\nnanotubes (MWCNTs) and graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs). Due to the synergistic\neffect between CNTs and GNPs inside a polymeric matrix, we expected to obtain\nmore conductive nanocomposites than PDMS nanocomposite filled with only CNTs.\nAdditionally, we investigated the effect of sulfuric acid treatment to surface\ncomposition and electrical conductivity of prepared PDMS/MWCNT/GNP\nnanocomposites. Results indicated that electrical conductivity of sulfuric\nacid-treated samples was significantly higher than untreated samples. The level\nof conductivity in the range of from 270.7 to 1074.9 S/m was obtained, and the\nhigher ones are the samples treated with acid solution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 May 2020 11:55:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-19"}

The\naverage app size has increased three to four times over five years. In this\npaper, we explore a new paradigm of targeted inter-procedural analysis that can\nskip irrelevant code and focus only on the flows of security-sensitive sink\nAPIs. To this end, we propose a technique called on-the-fly bytecode search,\nwhich searches the disassembled app bytecode text just in time when a caller\nneeds to be located. In this way, it guides targeted (and backward)\ninter-procedural analysis step by step until reaching entry points, without\nrelying on a whole-app graph. Such search-based inter-procedural analysis,\nhowever, is challenging due to Java polymorphism, callbacks, asynchronous\nflows, static initializers, and inter-component communication in Android apps.\nWe overcome these unique obstacles in our context by proposing a set of\nbytecode search mechanisms that utilize flexible searches and forward object\ntaint analysis. Atop of this new inter-procedural analysis, we further adjust\nthe traditional backward slicing and forward constant propagation to provide\nthe complete dataflow tracking of sink API calls. We have implemented a\nprototype called BackDroid and compared it with Amandroid in analyzing 3,178\nmodern popular apps for crypto and SSL misconfigurations. The evaluation shows\nthat for such sink-based problems, BackDroid is 37 times faster (2.13 v.s.\n78.15 minutes) and has no timed-out failure (v.s. 35% in Amandroid), while\nmaintaining close or even better detection effectiveness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 May 2020 12:50:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-26"}

A feature dubbed quantum speedup. However, the effect of noise on these\nproposals is not well understood in general, and in certain cases it is known\nthat simple noise can destroy the quantum speedup.\n  Here we develop a fault-tolerant version of one family of these sampling\nproblems, which we show can be implemented using quantum circuits of constant\ndepth.

They have recently been fruitfully explored in\nunderstanding minimisation of various types of automata. In Bezhanishvili et\nal. (2012), a dual equivalence between a category of coalgebras and a category\nof algebras was used to explain minimisation. The algebraic semantics is dual\nto a coalgebraic semantics in which logical equivalence coincides with trace\nequivalence. It follows that maximal quotients of coalgebras correspond to\nminimal subobjects of algebras. Examples include partially observable\ndeterministic finite automata, linear weighted automata viewed as coalgebras\nover finite-dimensional vector spaces, and belief automata, which are\ncoalgebras on compact Hausdorff spaces. In Bonchi et al. (2014), Brzozowski's\ndouble-reversal minimisation algorithm for deterministic finite automata was\ndescribed categorically and its correctness explained via the duality between\nreachability and observability. This work includes generalisations of\nBrzozowski's algorithm to Moore and weighted automata over commutative\nsemirings.\n  In this paper we propose a general categorical framework within which such\nminimisation algorithms can be understood. The goal is to provide a unifying\nperspective based on duality. Our framework consists of a stack of three\ninterconnected adjunctions: a base dual adjunction that can be lifted to a dual\nadjunction between coalgebras and algebras and also to a dual adjunction\nbetween automata.

Despite extensive Ly-alpha Blobs (LAB)\nsurveys from low to high redshifts, giant LABs over 100 kpc have been found\nmostly at z~2-4.

Online recommendation, e.g., multi-armed bandit approach, addresses this\nlimitation by interactively exploring user preference online and pursuing the\nexploration-exploitation (EE) trade-off. However, existing bandit-based methods\nmodel recommendation actions homogeneously. Specifically, they only consider\nthe items as the arms, being incapable of handling the item attributes, which\nnaturally provide interpretable information of user's current demands and can\neffectively filter out undesired items. In this work, we consider the\nconversational recommendation for cold-start users, where a system can both ask\nthe attributes from and recommend items to a user interactively. This important\nscenario was studied in a recent work. However, it employs a hand-crafted\nfunction to decide when to ask attributes or make recommendations. Such\nseparate modeling of attributes and items makes the effectiveness of the system\nhighly rely on the choice of the hand-crafted function, thus introducing\nfragility to the system. To address this limitation, we seamlessly unify\nattributes and items in the same arm space and achieve their EE trade-offs\nautomatically using the framework of Thompson Sampling.

Movement data provides valuable information about routes\nand specific roads that people are likely to drive on. This allows us to\npinpoint roads that occur in many routes and are thus sensitive to congestion.\nRedistributing some of the traffic to avoid unnecessary use of these roads\ncould be a key factor in improving traffic flow. Many proposed approaches to\ncombat congestion are either static or do not incorporate any movement data. In\nthis work, we present a method to redistribute traffic through the introduction\nof externally imposed variable costs to each road segment, assuming that all\ndrivers seek to drive the cheapest route. We use a metaheuristic optimisation\napproach to minimise total travel times by optimising a set of road-specific\nvariable cost parameters, which are used as input for an objective function\nbased on traffic flow theory. The optimisation scenario for the city centre of\nTokyo considered in this paper was defined using public spatial road network\ndata, and movement data acquired from Foursquare. Experimental results show\nthat our proposed scenario has the potential to achieve a 62.6\\% improvement of\ntotal travel time in Tokyo compared to that of a currently operational road\nnetwork configuration, with no imposed variable costs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 May 2020 21:28:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-04"}

Stan is an\nexpressive probabilistic programming language that abstracts the inference and\nallows users to focus on the modeling. As a result, Stan code is readable and\neasily extensible, which makes the modeler's work more transparent.\nFurthermore, Stan's main inference engine, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling, is\namiable to diagnostics, which means the user can verify whether the obtained\ninference is reliable. In this tutorial, we demonstrate how to formulate, fit,\nand diagnose a compartmental transmission model in Stan, first with a simple\nSusceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model, then with a more elaborate\ntransmission model used during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. We also cover advanced\ntopics which can further help practitioners fit sophisticated models; notably,\nhow to use simulations to probe the model and priors, and computational\ntechniques to scale-up models based on ordinary differential equations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 23 May 2020 11:19:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 4 Feb 2021 13:04:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 30 Sep 2021 13:03:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-01"}

To get\ndeeper insight of the intrinsic mechanism of GANs, in this paper, a method for\ninterpreting the latent space of GANs by analyzing the correlation between\nlatent variables and the corresponding semantic contents in generated images is\nproposed. Unlike previous methods that focus on dissecting models via feature\nvisualization, the emphasis of this work is put on the variables in latent\nspace, i.e. how the latent variables affect the quantitative analysis of\ngenerated results. Given a pretrained GAN model with weights fixed, the latent\nvariables are intervened to analyze their effect on the semantic content in\ngenerated images. A set of controlling latent variables can be derived for\nspecific content generation, and the controllable semantic content manipulation\nbe achieved.

To allow the public to be aware of the\nexposure risks in their daily activities, we proposed a birthday-paradox-based\nprobability model and implement it into a web-based system named COSRE for\nestimating community exposure risks of public gathering during a pandemic. The\nexposure risk means the probability of people meeting potential COVID hosts in\npublic places like grocery stores, gyms, libraries, restaurants, coffee shops,\noffice suits, etc. The model has three inputs: the real-time potential active\npatients, the population in local communities, and the customer counts in the\nroom. With COSRE, people can explore the possible impacts of the pandemic by\ndoing spatiotemporal analysis, e.g., moving through time and testing a\ndifferent number of people to see the changes of risks as the pandemic unfolds.\nThe system has the potential to advance our ability to know the accurate\nexposure risks in various communities and allow us to make plans with improved\npreparedness and precise responses for the pandemic. We use spatial analysis\ntools and drew the county-level exposure risks of the United States from April\n1 to May 15. The experiment shows that the estimation model is very promising\nto assist people to be more specifically precise about their safety control in\ndaily routine and social lives and help businesses to dynamically adjust their\nCOVID-19 policies to accelerate their recovery.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 22 May 2020 21:12:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-19"}
