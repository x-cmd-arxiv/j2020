It is customary to perform a\nsensitivity analysis reporting results for a range of values of the discounting\nfactor. However, one often wishes to assign it a prior distribution and\nestimate it jointly with the parameters, which in turn necessitates the\ncomputation of a normalising constant. In this paper we are concerned with how\nto recycle computations from a sensitivity analysis in order to approximately\nsample from joint posterior of the parameters and the discounting factor.

The most common concurrency bugs are data races, which are\naccesses to a shared resource that can be executed concurrently. Dynamic\ndata-race prediction is the most standard technique for detecting data races:\ngiven an observed, data-race-free trace $t$, the task is to determine whether\n$t$ can be reordered to a trace $t^*$ that exposes a data-race. Although the\nproblem has received significant practical attention for over three decades,\nits complexity has remained elusive. In this work, we address this lacuna,\nidentifying sources of intractability and conditions under which the problem is\nefficiently solvable. Given a trace $t$ of size $n$ over $k$ threads, our main\nresults are as follows.\n  First, we establish a general $O(k\\cdot n^{2\\cdot (k-1)})$ upper-bound, as\nwell as an $O(n^k)$ upper-bound when certain parameters of $t$ are constant. In\naddition, we show that the problem is NP-hard and even W[1]-hard parameterized\nby $k$, and thus unlikely to be fixed-parameter tractable. Second, we study the\nproblem over acyclic communication topologies, such as server-clients\nhierarchies. We establish an $O(k^2\\cdot d\\cdot n^2\\cdot \\log n)$ upper-bound,\nwhere $d$ is the number of shared variables accessed in $t$. In addition, we\nshow that even for traces with $k=2$ threads, the problem has no\n$O(n^{2-\\epsilon})$ algorithm under Orthogonal Vectors. Since any trace with 2\nthreads defines an acyclic topology, our upper-bound for this case is optimal\nwrt polynomial improvements for up to moderate values of $k$ and $d$. Finally,\nwe study a distance-bounded version of the problem, where the task is to expose\na data race by a witness trace that is similar to $t$.

It requires the consideration of various attributes like\nhuman preferences and thinking, which constrain achieving the optimal value of\nthe problem objectives. The value of the objectives may be maximized or\nminimized, depending on the situation. Numerous times, the values of these\nproblem parameters are in linguistic form, as human beings naturally understand\nand express themselves using words. These problems are therefore termed as\nlinguistic optimization problems (LOPs), and are of two types, namely single\nobjective linguistic optimization problems (SOLOPs) and multi-objective\nlinguistic optimization problems (MOLOPs). In these LOPs, the value of the\nobjective function(s) may not be known at all points of the decision space, and\ntherefore, the objective function(s) as well as problem constraints are linked\nby the if-then rules. Tsukamoto inference method has been used to solve these\nLOPs; however, it suffers from drawbacks. As, the use of linguistic information\ninevitably calls for the utilization of computing with words (CWW), and\ntherefore, 2-tuple linguistic model based solution methodologies were proposed\nfor LOPs.

The goal in\nstatistical learning is to use data to obtain simple algorithms for predicting\na random variable $Y$ from a correlated observation $X$. Since the dimension of\n$X$ is typically huge, computationally feasible solutions should summarize it\ninto a lower-dimensional feature vector $T$, from which $Y$ is predicted. The\nalgorithm will successfully make the prediction if $T$ is a good proxy of $Y$,\ndespite the said dimensionality-reduction. A myriad of ML algorithms (mostly\nemploying deep learning (DL)) for finding such representations $T$ based on\nreal-world data are now available. While these methods are often effective in\npractice, their success is hindered by the lack of a comprehensive theory to\nexplain it. The information bottleneck (IB) theory recently emerged as a bold\ninformation-theoretic paradigm for analyzing DL systems. Adopting mutual\ninformation as the figure of merit, it suggests that the best representation\n$T$ should be maximally informative about $Y$ while minimizing the mutual\ninformation with $X$. In this tutorial we survey the information-theoretic\norigins of this abstract principle, and its recent impact on DL. For the\nlatter, we cover implications of the IB problem on DL theory, as well as\npractical algorithms inspired by it. Our goal is to provide a unified and\ncohesive description.

They\nare increasingly used with machine learning methods to predict biologically\nmeaningful interactions. While deep learning on graphs has dramatically\nadvanced the prediction prowess, current graph neural network (GNN) methods are\noptimized for prediction on the basis of direct similarity between interacting\nnodes. In biological networks, however, similarity between nodes that do not\ndirectly interact has proved incredibly useful in the last decade across a\nvariety of interaction networks. Here, we present SkipGNN, a graph neural\nnetwork approach for the prediction of molecular interactions. SkipGNN predicts\nmolecular interactions by not only aggregating information from direct\ninteractions but also from second-order interactions, which we call skip\nsimilarity. In contrast to existing GNNs, SkipGNN receives neural messages from\ntwo-hop neighbors as well as immediate neighbors in the interaction network and\nnon-linearly transforms the messages to obtain useful information for\nprediction. To inject skip similarity into a GNN, we construct a modified\nversion of the original network, called the skip graph. We then develop an\niterative fusion scheme that optimizes a GNN using both the skip graph and the\noriginal graph. Experiments on four interaction networks, including drug-drug,\ndrug-target, protein-protein, and gene-disease interactions, show that SkipGNN\nachieves superior and robust performance, outperforming existing methods by up\nto 28.8\\% of area under the precision recall curve (PR-AUC).

This close-to-zero sensitivity is seen as evidence that participants\ncannot consciously report the category of the masked stimuli. Nevertheless, the\ncategory of the masked stimuli can indirectly affect responses to other stimuli\n(e.g., reaction times or brain activity). Priming is therefore seen as evidence\nthat there is still some (albeit unconscious) sensitivity to the stimulus\ncategories, thereby indicating processing outside consciousness.

One way to do so is erasure: a subset of inputs is considered\nirrelevant if it can be removed without affecting the prediction. Though\nconceptually simple, erasure's objective is intractable and approximate search\nremains expensive with modern deep NLP models. Erasure is also susceptible to\nthe hindsight bias: the fact that an input can be dropped does not mean that\nthe model `knows' it can be dropped. The resulting pruning is over-aggressive\nand does not reflect how the model arrives at the prediction. To deal with\nthese challenges, we introduce Differentiable Masking. DiffMask learns to\nmask-out subsets of the input while maintaining differentiability. The decision\nto include or disregard an input token is made with a simple model based on\nintermediate hidden layers of the analyzed model.

In this paper, we investigate extreme statistics of\nsearchers which move by anomalous subdiffusion. We model subdiffusion by a\nfractional Fokker-Planck equation involving the Riemann-Liouville fractional\nderivative. We prove an explicit and very general formula for every moment of\nsubdiffusive extreme FPTs and approximate their full probability distribution.\nWhile the mean FPT of a single subdiffusive searcher is infinite, the fastest\nsubdiffusive searcher out of many subdiffusive searchers typically has a finite\nmean FPT. In fact, we prove the counterintuitive result that extreme FPTs of\nsubdiffusion are faster than extreme FPTs of normal diffusion.

In this work, we investigate the\nviability of a Hamiltonian formulation in the baroclinic case. At odds with the\nbarotropic case, this formulation is non-conservative, yet it can be treated\nwell with approximate Riemann solver algorithms since the non-conservative\nterms vanish across genuinely nonlinear fields. Nonetheless, using numerical\n1-dimensional shock tube tests we find that the weak solutions of the\nHamiltonian system differ from the standard ones obtained by enforcing\nconservation of rest mass density, momentum density, and energy density across\ndiscontinuities. We also show that barotropic Hamiltonian formulations can\nadmit shockwaves at fluid-vacuum interfaces, which may be related to the\nunstable behavior of stellar surfaces observed in past numerical tests. In\nlight of the unphysical weak solutions, we expect that in future\nimplementations of the Hamiltonian formulation of hydrodynamics in numerical\nrelativity it will be necessary to use an explicitly barotropic formulation\nduring the inspiral phase, and then switch to a robust baroclinic formulation\nprior to merger.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Apr 2020 17:45:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Jun 2020 05:05:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-19"}

Several scattering surfaces with varying degree of Lambertian\nand specular contributions were examined experimentally; it is found that for a\nLambertian surface the structural similarity index (SSIM) of reconstructed\nimages is about 0.63, while the SSIM obtained from a scattering surface\npossessing a specular component can be as high as 0.93. A forward model of\nlight transport was developed based on the Phong scattering model. Scattering\npatterns from Phong surfaces with different degrees of specular contribution\nwere numerically simulated.

Singular value spectra of the underlying transfer\nmatrix were calculated for various Phong surfaces. As the weight and the\nshininess factor increase, i.e., the specular contribution increases, the\nsingular value spectrum broadens and the 50-dB bandwidth is increased by more\nthan 4X with a 10% specular contribution, which indicates that at the presence\nof even a small amount of specular contribution the NLOS measurement can retain\nsignificantly more singular value components, leading to higher reconstruction\nfidelity.

We find that in the\nmost massive and reddest ETGs the fraction of light in, probably accreted,\nhalos is much larger than in the other galaxies.

Such advances allow the estimation\nof high-dimensional distributions, such as normative distributions, with higher\naccuracy than previous methods.The main approach of the recently proposed\nmethods is to learn a latent-variable model parameterized with networks to\napproximate the normative distribution using example images showing healthy\nanatomy, perform prior-projection, i.e. reconstruct the image with lesions\nusing the latent-variable model, and determine lesions based on the differences\nbetween the reconstructed and original images.

Standard inverted index methods such as TF-IDF are commonly used\nas thanks to their efficiency. However, their retrieval performance is limited\nas they simply use shallow and sparse lexical features. To break the IR\nbottleneck, recent studies show that stronger retrieval performance can be\nachieved by pretraining a effective paragraph encoder that index paragraphs\ninto dense vectors. Once trained, the corpus can be pre-encoded into\nlow-dimensional vectors and stored within an index structure where the\nretrieval can be efficiently implemented as maximum inner product search.\n  Despite the promising results, pretraining such a dense index is expensive\nand often requires a very large batch size. In this work, we propose a simple\nand resource-efficient method to pretrain the paragraph encoder. First, instead\nof using heuristically created pseudo question-paragraph pairs for pretraining,\nwe utilize an existing pretrained sequence-to-sequence model to build a strong\nquestion generator that creates high-quality pretraining data.

In a lab setting, real groups are\noften replaced by simulated groups: Instead of performing an actual group\ndiscussion, individual responses are aggregated by a numerical computation.\nWhile studies typically use unweighted majority voting (MV) for this\naggregation, the theoretically optimal method is confidence weighted majority\nvoting (CWMV) -- if confidence ratings for the individual responses are\navailable. However, it is not entirely clear how well the theoretically derived\nCWMV method predicts real group decisions and confidences. Therefore, we\ncompared simulated group responses using CWMV and MV to real group responses.\n  Results: Simulated group decisions based on CWMV matched the accuracy of real\ngroup decisions very well, while simulated group decisions based on MV showed\nlower accuracy. Also, CWMV well predicted the confidence that groups put into\ntheir group decisions. Yet, individuals and real groups showed a bias towards\nunder-confidence while CWMV does not.\n  Conclusion: Our results highlight the importance of taking into account\nindividual confidences when investigating group decisions: We found that real\ngroups can aggregate individual confidences such that they match the optimal\naggregation given by CWMV.

The cross-correlation (XC)\nbetween these probes can tighten constraints and it is therefore important to\nquantify their impact for Euclid. In this study we carefully quantify the\nimpact of XC not only on the final parameter constraints for different\ncosmological models, but also on the nuisance parameters. In particular, we aim\nat understanding the amount of additional information that XC can provide for\nparameters encoding systematic effects, such as galaxy bias or intrinsic\nalignments (IA). We follow the formalism presented in Euclid Collaboration:\nBlanchard et al. (2019) and make use of the codes validated therein. We show\nthat XC improves the dark energy Figure of Merit (FoM) by a factor $\\sim 5$,\nwhilst it also reduces the uncertainties on galaxy bias by $\\sim 17\\%$ and the\nuncertainties on IA by a factor $\\sim 4$.

We find that the XC terms\nare necessary to extract the full information content from the data in future\nanalyses. They help in better constraining the cosmological model, and lead to\na better understanding of the systematic effects that contaminate these probes.\nFurthermore, we find that XC helps in constraining the mean of the\nphotometric-redshift distributions, but it requires a more precise knowledge of\nthis mean in order not to degrade the final FoM.

Probability weighting is one such label. It expresses a mismatch\nbetween probabilities used in a formal model of a decision (i.e. model\nparameters) and probabilities inferred from real people's decisions (the same\nparameters estimated empirically). The inferred probabilities are called\n\"decision weights.\" It is considered a robust experimental finding that\ndecision weights are higher than probabilities for rare events, and\n(necessarily, through normalisation) lower than probabilities for common\nevents. Typically this is presented as a cognitive bias, i.e. an error of\njudgement by the person. Here we point out that the same observation can be\ndescribed differently: broadly speaking, probability weighting means that a\ndecision maker has greater uncertainty about the world than the observer. We\noffer a plausible mechanism whereby such differences in uncertainty arise\nnaturally: when a decision maker must estimate probabilities as frequencies in\na time series while the observer knows them a priori.

These\nmethods differ from model-based techniques in that they provide only posterior\npredictions for quantities (time series) of interest, not posterior models with\ncalibrated parameters. DSI methods require a large number of flow simulations\nto first be performed on prior geological realizations. Given observed data,\nposterior predictions can then be generated directly. DSI operates in a\nBayesian setting and provides posterior samples of the data vector. In this\nwork we develop and evaluate a new approach for data parameterization in DSI.\nParameterization reduces the number of variables to determine in the inversion,\nand it maintains the physical character of the data variables. The new\nparameterization uses a recurrent autoencoder (RAE) for dimension reduction,\nand a long-short-term memory (LSTM) network to represent flow-rate time series.\nThe RAE-based parameterization is combined with an ensemble smoother with\nmultiple data assimilation (ESMDA) for posterior generation. Results are\npresented for two- and three-phase flow in a 2D channelized system and a 3D\nmulti-Gaussian model.

We include spectroscopic redshifts for the\nbrightest galaxies (r < 18) in the fiducial case. We use these catalogues to\nmake measurements of parallax versus redshift,for various assumed survey\nparameters and analysis techniques. We find that in order to make a competitive\nmeasurement it will be necessary to model and correct for the peculiar velocity\ncomponent of galaxy proper motions. It will also be necessary to push\nastrometry of extended sources into a new regime, and combine information from\nthe different elements of resolved galaxies. In an appendix we describe some\nsimple tests of galaxy image registration which yield relatively promising\nresults.

We first need to understand if shutting down the economy helped. And if\nit did, is it possible to achieve similar gains in the war against the pandemic\nwhile partially opening up the economy? To do so, it is critical to understand\nthe effects of the various interventions that can be put into place and their\ncorresponding health and economic implications. Since many interventions exist,\nthe key challenge facing policy makers is understanding the potential\ntrade-offs between them, and choosing the particular set of interventions that\nworks best for their circumstance. In this memo, we provide an overview of\nSynthetic Interventions (a natural generalization of Synthetic Control), a\ndata-driven and statistically principled method to perform what-if scenario\nplanning, i.e., for policy makers to understand the trade-offs between\ndifferent interventions before having to actually enact them. In essence, the\nmethod leverages information from different interventions that have already\nbeen enacted across the world and fits it to a policy maker's setting of\ninterest, e.g., to estimate the effect of mobility-restricting interventions on\nthe U.S., we use daily death data from countries that enforced severe mobility\nrestrictions to create a \"synthetic low mobility U.S.\" and predict the\ncounterfactual trajectory of the U.S. if it had indeed applied a similar\nintervention. Using Synthetic Interventions, we find that lifting severe\nmobility restrictions and only retaining moderate mobility restrictions (at\nretail and transit locations), seems to effectively flatten the curve. We hope\nthis provides guidance on weighing the trade-offs between the safety of the\npopulation, strain on the healthcare system, and impact on the economy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Apr 2020 19:39:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 10 May 2020 15:52:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-12"}

Quasi-clique is one of the most\nnatural definitions for dense structures useful in finding communities in\nsocial networks and discovering significant biomolecule structures and\npathways.

We also find the low-lying families of bulk\nand surface nonlinear modes and their bifurcation diagrams. Here the\nphenomenology is similar for all exponents and resembles what has been observed\nin other discrete evolution equations, such as the DNLS. The propagation of an\ninitially localized magnetic excitation is always ballistic, with a `speed'\nthat is computed in exact form as a function of the fractional exponent. For a\ngiven exponent, it increases with an increase in coupling up to a critical\ncoupling value, beyond which the ballistic speed could diverge inside the\nfractional interval $[0,1]$. Examination of the modulational instability shows\nthat it tends to increase with an increase in the fractional exponent, where\nthe decay proceeds via the formation of filamentary structures that merge\neventually and form pure radiation. The dynamical selftrapping around an\ninitially localized excitation increases with the fractional exponent, but it\nalso shows a degree of trapping in the linear limit. This trapping increases\nwith a decrease in the exponent and can be explained by near-degeneracy\nconsiderations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Apr 2020 20:21:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-30"}

For first-order calculations a nucleon-nucleon\n(\\textit{NN}) interaction and a one-body density of the nucleus were taken as\ninput to rigorous calculations of microscopic full-folding calculations.\n  Purpose: Based on the spectator expansion of the multiple scattering series\nwe employ a chiral next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) nucleon-nucleon\ninteraction on the same footing in the structure as well as in the reaction\ncalculation to obtain an in leading-order consistent effective potential for\nnucleon-nucleus elastic scattering, which includes the spin of the struck\ntarget nucleon.\n  Methods: The first order effective folding potential is computed by first\nderiving a nonlocal scalar density as well as a spin-projected momentum\ndistribution. Those are then integrated with the off-shell Wolfenstein\namplitudes $A$, $C$, and $M$. The resulting nonlocal potential serves as input\nto a momentum-space Lippmann-Schwinger equation, whose solutions are summed to\nobtain the nucleon-nucleus scattering observables.\n  Results: We calculate elastic scattering observables for $^4$He, $^6$He,\n$^8$He, $^{12}$C, and $^{16}$O in the energy regime between 100 and 200 MeV\nprojectile kinetic energy, and compare to available data.

We find that for closed-shell nuclei the\napproximation of ignoring the spin of the struck target nucleon is excellent.\nWe only see effects of the spin of the struck target nucleon when considering\n$^6$He and $^8$He, which are nuclei with a $N/Z$ ratio larger than 1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Apr 2020 21:17:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-16"}

In NLP this often entails extracting snippets of\nan input text `responsible for' corresponding model output; when such a snippet\ncomprises tokens that indeed informed the model's prediction, it is a faithful\nexplanation. In some settings, faithfulness may be critical to ensure\ntransparency. Lei et al. (2016) proposed a model to produce faithful rationales\nfor neural text classification by defining independent snippet extraction and\nprediction modules. However, the discrete selection over input tokens performed\nby this method complicates training, leading to high variance and requiring\ncareful hyperparameter tuning. We propose a simpler variant of this approach\nthat provides faithful explanations by construction. In our scheme, named\nFRESH, arbitrary feature importance scores (e.g., gradients from a trained\nmodel) are used to induce binary labels over token inputs, which an extractor\ncan be trained to predict. An independent classifier module is then trained\nexclusively on snippets provided by the extractor; these snippets thus\nconstitute faithful explanations, even if the classifier is arbitrarily\ncomplex. In both automatic and manual evaluations we find that variants of this\nsimple framework yield predictive performance superior to `end-to-end'\napproaches, while being more general and easier to train.

Existing approaches require dialog datasets to\nexplicitly annotate these KB queries -- these annotations can be time\nconsuming, and expensive. In response, we define the novel problems of\npredicting the KB query and training the dialog agent, without explicit KB\nquery annotation. For query prediction, we propose a reinforcement learning\n(RL) baseline, which rewards the generation of those queries whose KB results\ncover the entities mentioned in subsequent dialog. Further analysis reveals\nthat correlation among query attributes in KB can significantly confuse memory\naugmented policy optimization (MAPO), an existing state of the art RL agent.

Kerr theory only accounts for qubit frequency\nrenormalization, while adopting number states as the eigenstates of the bare\nqubit Hamiltonian. Starting from the Josephson nonlinearity and by accounting\nfor the eigenstates renormalization, due to counter-rotating terms, we derive a\nnew starting model for the cross-resonance gate with modified qubit-qubit\ninteraction and drive matrix elements. Employing time-dependent\nSchrieffer-Wolff perturbation theory, we derive an effective Hamiltonian for\nthe cross-resonance gate with estimates for the gate parameters calculated up\nto the fourth order in drive amplitude. The new model with renormalized\neigenstates lead to 10-15 percent relative correction of the effective gate\nparameters compared to Kerr theory. We find that gate operation is strongly\ndependent on the ratio of qubit-qubit detuning and anharmonicity. In\nparticular, we characterize five distinct regions of operation, and propose\ncandidate parameter choices for achieving high gate speed and low coherent gate\nerror when the cross-resonance tone is equipped with an echo pulse sequence.\nFurthermore, we generalize our method to include a third spectator qubit and\ncharacterize possible detrimental multi-qubit frequency collisions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Apr 2020 22:50:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 May 2020 04:47:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-21"}

When $k$ is part of the input, the problem is NP-complete and\nhard to approximate within any factor less than $2$. Recently, the problem has\nreceived significant attention from the perspective of parameterized\napproximation.

Though the general trend as a\nfunction of the mass number is well described by the $A^{1/3}$ rule, some fine\nstructures, such as the evolution along the calcium isotopic chain and the\ncorresponding odd-even staggerings, are notoriously difficult to describe both\nin density functional theories and ab initio methods. In this letter, we\npropose a novel ansatz to describe the charge radii of calcium isotopes, by\nadding a correction term, proportional to the number of Cooper pairs, and\ndetermined by the BCS amplitudes and a single parameter, to the charge radii\ncalculated in the relativistic mean field model with the pairing interaction\ntreated with the BCS method. The new ansatz yields results consistent with data\nnot only for calcium isotopes, but also for ten other isotopic chains,\nincluding oxygen, neon, magnesium, chromium, nickel, germanium, zirconium,\ncadmium, tin, and lead. It is remarkable that this ansatz with a single\nparameter can describe nuclear charge radii throughout the periodic table,\nparticularly the odd-even staggerings and parabolic behavior. We hope that the\npresent study can stimulate more discussions about its nature and relation with\nother effects proposed to explain the odd-even staggerings of charge radii.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Apr 2020 23:34:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-12"}

The goal is to design an adaptive\nquery algorithm, called a strategy, that identifies an initially unknown target\nvertex in a graph by asking queries. Each query is conducted as follows: the\nstrategy selects a vertex $q$ and receives a reply $v$: if $q$ is the target,\nthen $v=q$, and if $q$ is not the target, then $v$ is a neighbor of $q$ that\nlies on a shortest path to the target. Furthermore, there is a noise parameter\n$0\\leq p<\\frac{1}{2}$, which means that each reply can be incorrect with\nprobability $p$. The optimization criterion to be minimized is the overall\nnumber of queries asked by the strategy, called the query complexity. The query\ncomplexity is well understood to be $O(\\varepsilon^{-2}\\log n)$ for general\ngraphs, where $n$ is the order of the graph and $\\varepsilon=\\frac{1}{2}-p$.\nHowever, implementing such a strategy is computationally expensive, with each\nquery requiring possibly $O(n^2)$ operations.\n  In this work we propose two efficient strategies that keep the optimal query\ncomplexity.

In the\npast two decades, great strides have been made in this field, making PBA a\ncandidate for next-generation light sources and colliders.

If we treat this tuple as an array, the shape of that array\nis described by the single natural number n. A natural number itself can be\nalso treated as an array with the shape described by the natural number 1 (or\nthe element of any singleton set). This observation gives rise to the hierarchy\nof array types where the shape of an array of level l+1 is a level-l array of\nnatural numbers. Such a hierarchy occurs naturally when treating arrays as\ncontainers, which makes it possible to define both rank- and level-polymorphic\noperations.

The overwhelming number of sources under analysis\nrequest the use of automatic procedures. In this context, previous works\nintroduced the use of Machine Learning (ML) methods for the variable star\nclassification. Our goal is the development and analysis of an automatic\nprocedure, based on ML, for the identification of RRLs in the VVV Survey. This\nprocedure will be use to generate reliable catalogs integrated over several\ntiles in the survey. After the reconstruction of light-curves, we extract a set\nof period and intensity-based features. We use for the first time a new subset\nof pseudo color features. We discuss all the appropriate steps needed to define\nour automatic pipeline: selection of quality measures; sampling procedures;\nclassifier setup and model selection. As final result, we construct an ensemble\nclassifier with an average Recall of 0.48 and average Precision of 0.86 over 15\ntiles. We also make available our processed datasets and a catalog of candidate\nRRLs. Perhaps most interestingly, from a classification perspective based on\nphotometric broad-band data, is that our results indicate that Color is an\ninformative feature type of the RRL that should be considered for automatic\nclassification methods via ML. We also argue that Recall and Precision in both\ntables and curves are high quality metrics for this highly imbalanced problem.\nFurthermore, we show for our VVV data-set that to have good estimates it is\nimportant to use the original distribution more than reduced samples with an\nartificial balance. Finally, we show that the use of ensemble classifiers helps\nresolve the crucial model selection step, and that most errors in the\nidentification of RRLs are related to low quality observations of some sources\nor to the difficulty to resolve the RRL-C type given the date.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 May 2020 04:35:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 May 2021 19:29:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-06"}

In contrast, for both binary and Poisson\nregression, using general stochastic process prior, our approach involves\nverification of asymptotic equipartition property along with the method of\nsieve, which is a manoeuvre of the general results of Shalizi (2009), useful\neven for misspecified models. Moreover, we will establish not only posterior\nconsistency but also the rates at which the posterior probabilities converge,\nwhich turns out to be the Kullback-Leibler divergence rate. We also investgate\nthe traditional posterior convergence rates.

We find that, by adopting the mu_0\nrenormalization scale of Harlander et al. instead of the conventional\nmu_d=1/sqrt{8t} scale, the linear behavior at large t is improved so that we\ncan perform the t -> 0 extrapolation of the SFtX method more confidently. In\nthe calculation of the two-loop matching coefficients by Harlander et al., the\nequation of motion for quark fields was used. For the entropy density in which\nthe equation of motion has no effects, we find that the results using the\ntwo-loop coefficients agree well with those using one-loop coefficients. On the\nother hand, for the trace anomaly which is affected by the equation of motion,\nwe find discrepancies between the one- and two-loop results at high\ntemperatures. By comparing the results of one-loop coefficients with and\nwithout using the equation of motion, the main origin of the discrepancies is\nsuggested to be attributed to O((aT)^2)=O(1/N_t^2) discretization errors in the\nequation of motion at N_t =< 10.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 May 2020 07:14:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 19 Jul 2020 14:24:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2020 05:23:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-02"}

However, the\ncommunication performance of MPI+threads can be 100x slower than that of MPI\neverywhere. Both MPI users and developers are to blame for this slowdown.\nTypically, MPI users do not expose logical communication parallelism.\nConsequently, MPI libraries use conservative approaches, such as a global\ncritical section, to maintain MPI's ordering constraints for MPI+threads, thus\nserializing access to parallel network resources and hurting performance.\n  To enhance MP+threads' communication performance, researchers have proposed\nMPI Endpoints as a user-visible extension to MPI-3.1. MPI Endpoints allows a\nsingle process to create multiple MPI ranks within a communicator. This could\nallow each thread to have a dedicated communication path to the network and\nimprove performance. The onus of mapping threads to endpoints, however, would\nthen be on domain scientists. We play the role of devil's advocate and question\nthe need for user-visible endpoints. We certainly agree that dedicated\ncommunication channels are critical. To what extent, however, can we hide these\nchannels inside the MPI library without modifying the MPI standard and thus\nunburden the user? More important, what functionality would we lose through\nsuch abstraction? This paper answers these questions through a new MPI-3.1\nimplementation that uses virtual communication interfaces (VCIs). VCIs abstract\nunderlying network contexts. When users expose parallelism through existing MPI\nmechanisms, the MPI library maps that parallelism to the VCIs, relieving domain\nscientists from endpoints. We identify cases where VCIs perform as well as\nuser-visible endpoints, as well as cases where such abstraction hurts\nperformance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 May 2020 07:54:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-04"}

Building up such flexibility within the\nedge-to-cloud continuum consisting of a distributed networked ecosystem of\nheterogeneous computing resources is challenging. Furthermore, IoT traffic\ndynamics and the rising demand for low-latency services foster the need for\nminimizing the response time and balanced service placement. Load-balancing for\nfog computing becomes a cornerstone for cost-effective system management and\noperations. This paper studies two optimization objectives and formulates a\ndecentralized load-balancing problem for IoT service placement: (global) IoT\nworkload balance and (local) quality of service (QoS), in terms of minimizing\nthe cost of deadline violation, service deployment, and unhosted services. The\nproposed solution, EPOS Fog, introduces a decentralized multi-agent system for\ncollective learning that utilizes edge-to-cloud nodes to jointly balance the\ninput workload across the network and minimize the costs involved in service\nexecution. The agents locally generate possible assignments of requests to\nresources and then cooperatively select an assignment such that their\ncombination maximizes edge utilization while minimizes service execution cost.\nExtensive experimental evaluation with realistic Google cluster workloads on\nvarious networks demonstrates the superior performance of EPOS Fog in terms of\nworkload balance and QoS, compared to approaches such as First Fit and\nexclusively Cloud-based. The results confirm that EPOS Fog reduces service\nexecution delay up to 25% and the load-balance of network nodes up to 90%. The\nfindings also demonstrate how distributed computational resources on the edge\ncan be utilized more cost-effectively by harvesting collective intelligence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 May 2020 08:42:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 11 Jan 2021 07:40:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 23 Apr 2021 07:52:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-26"}

A promising means of balancing accuracy\nagainst computational cost are non-self-consistent calculations with hybrid\ndensity-functional theory, where the electronic band energies are evaluated\nusing a hybrid functional from orbitals obtained with a less demanding\n(semi-)local functional. We have quantified the performance of this technique\nfor predicting the physical properties of sixteen tetrahedral semiconductors\nwith bandgaps from 0.2-5.5 eV. Provided the base functional predicts a\nnon-metallic electronic structure, bandgaps within 5 % of the PBE0 and HSE06\ngaps can be obtained with an order of magnitude reduction in computing time.\nThe positions of the valence and conduction band extrema and the Fermi level\nare well reproduced, further enabling calculation of the band dispersion,\ndensity of states, and dielectric properties using Fermi's Golden Rule. While\nthe error in the non-self-consistent total energies is ~50 meV atom-1, the\nenergy-volume curves are reproduced accurately enough to obtain the equilibrium\nvolume and bulk modulus with minimal error. We also test the\ndielectric-dependent scPBE0 functional and obtain bandgaps and dielectric\nconstants to within 2.5 % of the self-consistent results, which amount to a\nsignificant improvement over self-consistent PBE0 for a similar computational\ncost. We identify cases where the non-self-consistent approach is expected to\nperform poorly, and demonstrate that partial self-consistency provides a\npractical and efficient workaround. Finally, we perform proof-of-concept\ncalculations on CoO and NiO to demonstrate the applicability of the technique\nto strongly-correlated open-shell transition-metal oxides.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 May 2020 09:14:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-04"}

Though research on SRL has\nprimarily focused on verbal predicates and many resources available for SRL\nprovide annotations only for verbs, semantic relations are often triggered by\nother linguistic constructions, e.g., nominalizations. In this work, we\ninvestigate a transfer scenario where we assume role-annotated data for the\nsource verbal domain but only unlabeled data for the target nominal domain. Our\nkey assumption, enabling the transfer between the two domains, is that\nselectional preferences of a role (i.e., preferences or constraints on the\nadmissible arguments) do not strongly depend on whether the relation is\ntriggered by a verb or a noun. For example, the same set of arguments can fill\nthe Acquirer role for the verbal predicate `acquire' and its nominal form\n`acquisition'. We approach the transfer task from the variational autoencoding\nperspective. The labeler serves as an encoder (predicting role labels given a\nsentence), whereas selectional preferences are captured in the decoder\ncomponent (generating arguments for the predicting roles). Nominal roles are\nnot labeled in the training data, and the learning objective instead pushes the\nlabeler to assign roles predictive of the arguments. Sharing the decoder\nparameters across the domains encourages consistency between labels predicted\nfor both domains and facilitates the transfer.

Furthermore, like the deep ANNs,\nthe memory, compute and power requirements of SNNs also increase with model\nsize, and model compression becomes a necessity. Knowledge distillation is a\nmodel compression technique that enables transferring the learning of a large\nmachine learning model to a smaller model with minimal loss in performance.

Correcting defocus blur is challenging\nbecause the blur is spatially varying and difficult to estimate. We propose an\neffective defocus deblurring method that exploits data available on dual-pixel\n(DP) sensors found on most modern cameras. DP sensors are used to assist a\ncamera's auto-focus by capturing two sub-aperture views of the scene in a\nsingle image shot. The two sub-aperture images are used to calculate the\nappropriate lens position to focus on a particular scene region and are\ndiscarded afterwards. We introduce a deep neural network (DNN) architecture\nthat uses these discarded sub-aperture images to reduce defocus blur. A key\ncontribution of our effort is a carefully captured dataset of 500 scenes (2000\nimages) where each scene has: (i) an image with defocus blur captured at a\nlarge aperture; (ii) the two associated DP sub-aperture views; and (iii) the\ncorresponding all-in-focus image captured with a small aperture.

A resonant interaction between the ambient vorticity of the\nundisturbed shear flow and the undulation of streamlines enforced by the wall\ntopography serves to slightly rotate the spanwise vorticity of the mean flow\ninto the streamwise direction, creating a swirling motion, in the form of\nregular streamwise rolls. The process is kinematic and essentially identical to\nthe `direct drive' CL1 mechanism for Langmuir circulation (LC) proposed by\nCraik (1970). Boundary layers are modelled by selecting suitable primary flow\nprofiles. A simple, easily integrable expression for the cross-plane stream\nfunction is found in two asymptotic regimes: the resonant onset of the\nessentially inviscid instability at early times, and the fully developed steady\nstate viscous flow. Linear-order solutions for flow over undulating boundaries\nare obtained, fully analytical in the special case of a power-law profile.\nThese solutions allow us to quickly map out the circulation response to\nboundary design parameters. The study is supplemented with direct numerical\nsimulations which verify the manifestation of boundary induced Langmuir\nvortices in laminar flows with no-slip boundaries. Simulations show good\nqualitative agreement with theory. Quantitatively, the comparisons rest on a\ndisplacement length closure parameter adopted in the perturbation theory.

We have compiled a large sample of data for GRB NHX\nand metallicity [X/H]. The main aims of this paper are to generate improved NHX\nfor our sample by using actual metallicities, dust corrected where available\nfor detections, and for the remaining GRB, a more realistic average intrinsic\nmetallicity using a standard adjustment from solar. Then, by approximating the\nGRB host intrinsic hydrogen column density using the measured neutral column\n(NHI,IC) adjusted for the ionisation fraction, we isolate a more accurate\nestimate for the intergalactic medium (IGM) contribution. The GRB sample mean\nmetallicity is = -1.17+/-0.09 rms (or 0.07+/-0.05 Z/Zsol) from a sample of 36\nGRB with a redshift 1.76 < z < 5.91, substantially lower than the assumption of\nsolar metallicity used as standard for many fitted NHX . Lower GRB host mean\nmetallicity results in increased estimated NHX with the correction scaling with\nredshift as log (NHX cm-2) = (0.59+/-0.04)log(1+z) + 0.18+/-0.02. Of the 128\nGRB with data for both NHX and NHI,IC in our sample, only 6 have NHI,IC > NHX\nwhen revised for realistic metallicity, compared to 32 when solar metallicity\nis assumed. The lower envelope of the revised NHX - NHI,IC, plotted against\nredshift can be fit by log(NHX - NHI,IC cm-2) =20.3 + 2.4 log(1+z). This is\ntaken to be an estimate for the maximum IGM hydrogen column density as a\nfunction of redshift. Using this approach, we estimate an upper limit to the\nhydrogen density at redshift zero (n0) to be consistent with n0 = 0.17 x\n10-7cm-3.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 May 2020 12:52:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 May 2020 17:46:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-27"}

Since the $\\sigma$-particle is unstable, for it to qualify as\ndark matter, its lifetime must be longer than $10^{25}$ seconds implying that\nthe $B-L$ gauge coupling must be very small.

A backmapping scheme was used to predict where solar wind\nmeasured by the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) originated in the corona.\nThe coronal composition measured by the Hinode Extreme ultraviolet Imaging\nSpectrometer (EIS) at the source regions was then compared with the in-situ\nsolar wind composition. On hourly timescales there was no apparent correlation\nbetween coronal and solar wind composition. In contrast, the distribution of\nfractionation values within individual source regions was similar in both the\ncorona and solar wind, but distributions between different sources have\nsignificant overlap. The matching distributions directly verifies that\nelemental composition is conserved as the plasma travels from the corona to the\nsolar wind, further validating it as a tracer of heating and acceleration\nprocesses. The overlap of fractionation values between sources means it is not\npossible to identify solar wind source regions solely by comparing solar wind\nand coronal composition measurements, but a comparison can be used to verify\nconsistency with predicted spacecraft-corona connections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 May 2020 13:28:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 8 Aug 2020 18:31:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-11"}

We use gamma-ray luminosities observed with the \\emph{fermi} Large\nArea Telescope as a proxy of the jet power for a population of 154 FSRQs.\nAssuming typical quasar accretion rates and using black hole mass measurements\nfrom a variety of methods, we find a mean jet production efficiency of about 10\nper cent for FSRQs, with values as high as 222 per cent.

To eliminate the threat\nof such acoustic covert channels in sensitive systems, audio hardware can be\ndisabled and the use of loudspeakers can be strictly forbidden. Such audio-less\nsystems are considered to be \\textit{audio-gapped}, and hence immune to\nacoustic covert channels.\n  In this paper, we introduce a technique that enable attackers leak data\nacoustically from air-gapped and audio-gapped systems. Our developed malware\ncan exploit the computer power supply unit (PSU) to play sounds and use it as\nan out-of-band, secondary speaker with limited capabilities. The malicious code\nmanipulates the internal \\textit{switching frequency} of the power supply and\nhence controls the sound waveforms generated from its capacitors and\ntransformers. Our technique enables producing audio tones in a frequency band\nof 0-24khz and playing audio streams (e.g., WAV) from a computer power supply\nwithout the need for audio hardware or speakers. Binary data (files,\nkeylogging, encryption keys, etc.) can be modulated over the acoustic signals\nand sent to a nearby receiver (e.g., smartphone). We show that our technique\nworks with various types of systems: PC workstations and servers, as well as\nembedded systems and IoT devices that have no audio hardware at all.

Our model is deliberately simple to ensure speed and\nreliability for automated, near real-time quality control of Argos data. We\nvalidate the model by fitting to Argos data collected from 61 individuals\nacross 7 marine vertebrates and compare model-estimated locations to GPS\nlocations. Estimation accuracy varied among species with median Root Mean\nSquared Errors usually < 5 km and decreased with increasing data sampling rate\nand precision of Argos locations.

However, energy trading might not completely absorb excess\nrenewable energy. A multi-energy management framework including fuel cell\nvehicles, energy storage, combined heat and power system, and renewable energy\nis proposed, and the characteristics and scheduling arrangements of fuel cell\nvehicles are considered to further improve the local absorption of the\nrenewable energy and enhance the economic benefits of microgrids.

This paper designs a joint energy\nscheduling and trading algorithm based on Lyapunov optimization and a\ndouble-auction mechanism. Its purpose is to determine the valuations of energy\nin the auction, optimally schedule energy distribution, and strategically\npurchase and sell energy with the current electricity prices.

In the\nsemi-streaming model, the edges of the input graph G = (V,E) are given as a\nstream e_1, ..., e_m, and the algorithm is allowed to make a single pass over\nthis stream while using $O(n \\textrm{polylog}(n))$ space ($m = |E|$ and $n =\n|V|$). If the order of edges is adversarial, a simple single-pass greedy\nalgorithm yields a $1/2$-approximation in $O(n)$ space; achieving a better\napproximation in adversarial streams remains an elusive open question.\n  A line of recent work shows that one can improve upon the $1/2$-approximation\nif the edges of the stream arrive in a random order. The state of the art for\nthis model is two-fold: Assadi et al.

The most common CFD method\nused in NPP thermal hydraulics simulation is Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes\n(RANS) method, which still has acknowledged deficiencies not only in the\ncalculation speed but also in the complexity of choosing turbulence model and\nparameters for different flow patterns. Data-driven turbulence modeling aims to\ndevelop a RANS-based method which not only computationally efficient but also\napplicable to different flow patterns. To achieve this goal, the first step is\nto develop an approach to properly perform RANS for selected flow patterns. In\nthis work, a machine learning approach is selected to achieve this goal.\n  The main purpose of this study is to perform a data-driven approach to model\nturbulence Reynolds stress leveraging the potential of massive direct numerical\nsimulation (DNS) data. The approach is validated by a turbulence flow\nvalidation case: a parallel plane quasi-steady state turbulence flow case.\n  The work contains three parts. The first part is database preparation. In\nthis step, turbulence properties (Reynolds stress) are extracted from DNS\nresults, which are considered as \"physically correct data\". Meanwhile, flow\nfeatures are extracted from RANS results, which are considered as \"data to be\ncorrected\". The second part is surrogate model establishment. In this step, a\ndata-driven regression function is trained between flow features and turbulence\nproperties obtained from the previous step. The last part is model validation,\nwhich is applying trained data-driven regression function to a test case to\nvalidate this approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 May 2020 14:57:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-04"}

The high rates for VR over short distances can only be supported by\nan enormous bandwidth, which is available in terahertz (THz) frequency bands.\nGuaranteeing HRLLC requires dealing with the uncertainty that is specific to\nthe THz channel. To explore the potential of THz for meeting HRLLC\nrequirements, a quantification of the risk for an unreliable VR performance is\nconducted through a novel and rigorous characterization of the tail of the\nend-to-end (E2E) delay. Then, a thorough analysis of the tail-value-atrisk\n(TVaR) is performed to concretely characterize the behavior of extreme wireless\nevents crucial to the real-time VR experience. System reliability for scenarios\nwith guaranteed line-of-sight (LoS) is then derived as a function of THz\nnetwork parameters after deriving a novel expression for the probability\ndistribution function of the THz transmission delay. Numerical results show\nthat abundant bandwidth and low molecular absorption are necessary to improve\nthe reliability. However, their effect remains secondary compared to the\navailability of LoS, which significantly affects the THz HRLLC performance. In\nparticular, for scenarios with guaranteed LoS, a reliability of 99.999% (with\nan E2E delay threshold of 20 ms) for a bandwidth of 15 GHz along with data\nrates of 18.3 Gbps can be achieved by the THz network (operating at a frequency\nof 1 THz), compared to a reliability of 96% for twice the bandwidth, when\nblockages are considered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 1 May 2020 03:15:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 24 Mar 2021 21:02:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-26"}

To notify the operator of a fault\noccurrence, alarms are utilized as a basic part of modern computer-controlled\nplants. However, due to the interconnections of different parts of a plant, a\nsingle fault often propagates through the plant and triggers a (sometimes\nlarge) number of alarms. A graphical plant topology can help operators, process\nengineers and maintenance experts find the root cause of a plant upset or\ndiscover the propagation path of a fault. In this paper, a method is developed\nto extract plant topology form alarm data. The method is based on process\nmining, a collection of concepts and algorithms that model a process (not\nnecessarily an engineering one) based on recorded events. The event based\nnature of alarm data as well as the chronological order of recorded alarms make\nthem suitable for process mining. The methodology developed in this paper is\nbased on preparing alarm data for process mining and then using the suitable\nprocess mining algorithms to extract plant topology. The extracted topology is\nrepresented by the familiar Petri net which can be used for root cause analysis\nand discovering fault propagation paths. The methods to evaluate the extracted\ntopology are also discussed. A case study on the well-known Tennessee Eastman\nprocess demonstrates the utility of the proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Apr 2020 20:05:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-05"}

To mitigate the costs associated with this\nchange and achieve performance for 5G and beyond, it is crucial to explore\nadvanced photonic devices that can enable high-bandwidth interconnects via\nwavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) in photonic integrated circuits.\nSubwavelength grating (SWG) filters have shown great promise for WDM\napplications. However, the small feature sizes necessary to implement these\nstructures have prohibited them from penetrating into industrial applications.\nTo explore the manufacturability and performance of SWG filters in an\nindustrial setting, we fabricate and characterize O-band subwavelength grating\nfilters using the monolithic photonics technology at GLOBALFOUNDRIES (GF). We\ndemonstrate a low drop channel loss of -1.2 dB with a flat-top response, a high\nextinction ratio of -30 dB, a 3 dB channel width of 5 nm and single-source\nthermal tunability without shape distortion. This filter structure was designed\nusing elements from the product design kit provided by GF and functions in a\ncompact footprint of 0.002 mm2 with a minimum feature size of 150 nm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Apr 2020 18:56:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-08"}

COVID-19 has caused by a new virus that\nhad not been identified in human previously. This was followed by a widespread\nand rapid spread of this epidemic throughout the world. Daily, the number of\nthe confirmed cases are increasing rapidly, number of the suspect increases,\nbased on the symptoms that accompany this disease, and unfortunately number of\nthe deaths also increase. Therefore, with these increases in number of cases\naround the world, it becomes hard to manage all these cases information with\ndifferent situations; if the patient either injured or suspect with which\nsymptoms that appeared on the patient. Therefore, there is a critical need to\nconstruct a multi-dimensional system to store and analyze the generated\nlarge-scale data. In this paper, a Comprehensive Storing System for COVID-19\ndata using Apache Spark (CSS-COVID) is proposed, to handle and manage the\nproblem caused by increasing the number of COVID-19 daily. CSS-COVID helps in\ndecreasing the processing time for querying and storing COVID-19 daily data.\nCSS-COVID consists of three stages, namely, inserting and indexing, storing,\nand querying stage. In the inserting stage, data is divided into subsets and\nthen index each subset separately. The storing stage uses set of storing-nodes\nto store data, while querying stage is responsible for handling the querying\nprocesses. Using Apache Spark in CSS-COVID leverages the performance of dealing\nwith large-scale data of the coronavirus disease injured whom increase daily. A\nset of experiments are applied, using real COVID-19 Datasets, to prove the\nefficiency of CSS-COVID in indexing large-scale data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 30 Apr 2020 19:42:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-12"}

The resulting all-polymer syntactic foam takes on\nexcellent damage tolerance properties, strong recoverability under large\nstrains, and favourable energy dissipation characteristics. Despite finding\nincreasing usage in various industries and applications, including in coatings,\nfilms, sealants, packaging, composites for microfluidics, medical ultrasonics\nand cementious composites, there is a near-complete absence of statistical\ngeometrical information for Expancel microspheres. Further, their mechanical\nproperties have not yet been reported. In this work we characterise the\ngeometrical quantities of two classes of Expancel thermoplastic microspheres\nusing X-ray computed tomography, focused ion beam and electron microscopy. We\nalso observe the spatial distribution of microspheres within a\npolyurethane-matrix syntactic foam. We show that the volume-weighted\npolydisperse shell diameter in both classes of microsphere follows a normal\ndistribution. Interestingly, polydispersity of the shell wall thickness is not\nobserved and in particular the shell thickness is not correlated to the shell\ndiameter. We employ the measured geometrical information in analytical\nmicromechanical techniques in the small strain regime to determine, for the\nfirst time, estimates of the Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio of the\nmicrosphere shell material. Our results contribute to potential future\nimprovements in the design and fabrication of syntactic foams that employ\nthermoplastic microspheres.

This work presents an IR-assisted thermal vulnerability detection\ntechnique suitable for photonic as well as electronic components.
