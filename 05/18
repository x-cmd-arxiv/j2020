The\npattern formation process sensitively depends on the lifting speed and is still\nnot fully understood. For some lifting speeds, such as linear or exponential\nspeed, the instability is transient and the interface eventually shrinks as a\ncircle.

We report on unusual\nphenomenon where double emulsions are spontaneously formed as soon an aqueous\nnanoparticle dispersion is placed in contact with an oleic micellar solution.\nNanoscale water droplets nucleate in oil in the form of swollen micelles.\nNanoparticles form a water-shell encapsulating the saturated oil phase with\nswollen micelles over time. Remarkably, we find that the gradual\nsurface-activation of nanoparticles is key in self-double emulsification and\ncontrolling the emulsion intensity.

We consider two varieties of\nfield fluctuations and their potential effects in a semiclassical description.\nThe first are the fluctuations of the time derivative a free massive scalar\nfield operator, which has been averaged over finite regions of space and time.\nThese fluctuations obey a Gaussian probability distribution. A sufficiently\nlarge fluctuation is assumed to produce an effect analogous to a classical\ninitial field velocity, which can cause a finite region to fly over the barrier\nseparating the meta-stable state from the stable vacuum state. Here we find a\ncontribution to the decay rate which is comparable to the decay rate by quantum\ntunneling, as computed in an instanton approximation. This result is consistent\nwith those of other authors. We next consider the effects of the fluctuations\nof operators which are quadratic in the time derivative of the free scalar\nfield. The quadratic operator is also averaged over finite regions of space and\nof time. Now the probability distribution for the averaged operator falls more\nslowly than an exponential function, allowing for the possibility of very large\nfluctuations. We find a contribution to the decay rate which is much larger\nthan those coming from either quantum tunneling or linear field fluctuations,\nand hence appears to be the dominant decay mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 May 2020 19:49:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 30 Apr 2022 02:27:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-03"}

With the\nadvances in Machine Learning (ML) technologies, there has been a significant\nincrease in the research of using ML to solve PDEs. The goal of this work is to\ndevelop an ML-based PDE solver, that couples important characteristics of\nexisting PDE solvers with ML technologies. The two solver characteristics that\nhave been adopted in this work are: 1) the use of discretization-based schemes\nto approximate spatio-temporal partial derivatives and 2) the use of iterative\nalgorithms to solve linearized PDEs in their discrete form. In the presence of\nhighly non-linear, coupled PDE solutions, these strategies can be very\nimportant in achieving good accuracy, better stability and faster convergence.\nOur ML-solver, DiscretizationNet, employs a generative CNN-based\nencoder-decoder model with PDE variables as both input and output features.\nDuring training, the discretization schemes are implemented inside the\ncomputational graph to enable faster GPU computation of PDE residuals, which\nare used to update network weights that result into converged solutions. A\nnovel iterative capability is implemented during the network training to\nimprove the stability and convergence of the ML-solver. The ML-Solver is\ndemonstrated to solve the steady, incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in 3-D\nfor several cases such as, lid-driven cavity, flow past a cylinder and\nconjugate heat transfer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 May 2020 19:54:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-19"}

Discrete element simulations show that prior\nto failure, the contact network is essentially static, with only minor\nrearrangements of the particles. However, the force network, which includes not\nonly the contact information, but also the information about the interaction\nstrength, undergoes a nontrivial evolution. An initial insight is reached by\nconsidering the relative magnitudes of normal and tangential forces between the\nparticles, and in particular the proportion of contacts that reach Coulomb\nthreshold. More detailed understanding of the processes leading to failure is\nreached by the analysis of both spatial and temporal properties of the force\nnetwork using the tools of persistent homology.

In\naddition to this temporal intermittency, the response of the force network is\nfound to be spatially dependent and influenced by proximity to the intruder.\nFurthermore, the response is modified significantly by the interaction\nstrength, with the relevant measures describing the response showing differing\nbehavior for the contacts characterized by large interaction forces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 May 2020 22:31:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-05"}

A request has to be connected to a set of facilities\njointly offering the commodities demanded by it. In comparison to the FLP, an\nalgorithm has to decide not only if and where to place facilities, but also\nwhich commodities to offer at each.\n  To the best of our knowledge we are the first to study the problem in its\nonline variant in which requests, their positions and their commodities are not\nknown beforehand but revealed over time. We present results regarding the\ncompetitive ratio. On the one hand, we show that heterogeneity influences the\ncompetitive ratio by developing a lower bound on the competitive ratio for any\nrandomized online algorithm of $\\Omega(\\sqrt{|S|}+\\frac{\\log n}{\\log\\log n})$\nthat already holds for simple line metrics. Here, $n$ is the number of\nrequests. On the other side, we establish a deterministic\n$O(\\sqrt{|S|}\\cdot\\log n)$-competitive algorithm and a randomized\n$O(\\sqrt{|S|}\\cdot\\frac{\\log n}{\\log\\log n})$-competitive algorithm. Further,\nwe show that when considering a more special class of cost functions for the\nconstruction cost of a facility, the competitive ratio decreases given by our\ndeterministic algorithm depending on the function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 17 May 2020 23:01:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 19 May 2020 08:56:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-20"}

In contrast to rotation-powered\npulsars, magnetar emission is thought to be fueled by the evolution and decay\nof their powerful magnetic fields. They display highly variable radio and X-ray\nemission, but the processes responsible for this behavior remain a mystery. We\nreport the discovery of bright, persistent individual X-ray pulses from XTE\nJ1810-197, a transient radio magnetar, using the Neutron star Interior\nComposition Explorer (NICER) following its recent radio reactivation. Similar\nbehavior has only been previously observed from a magnetar during short time\nperiods following a giant flare. However, the X-ray pulses presented here were\ndetected outside of a flaring state. They are less energetic and display\ntemporal structure that differs from the impulsive X-ray events previously\nobserved from the magnetar class, such as giant flares and short X-ray bursts.\nOur high frequency radio observations of the magnetar, carried out\nsimultaneously with the X-ray observations, demonstrate that the relative\nalignment between the X-ray and radio pulses varies on rotational timescales.\nNo correlation was found between the amplitudes or temporal structure of the\nX-ray and radio pulses. The magnetar's 8.3 GHz radio pulses displayed frequency\nstructure, which was not observed in the pulses detected simultaneously at 31.9\nGHz. Many of the radio pulses were also not detected simultaneously at both\nfrequencies, which indicates that the underlying emission mechanism producing\nthese pulses is not broadband. We find that the radio pulses from XTE J1810-197\nshare similar characteristics to radio bursts detected from fast radio burst\n(FRB) sources, some of which are now thought to be produced by active\nmagnetars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 May 2020 00:46:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-19"}

In\nthis study, we used computational neuroscience methods to investigate the\neffects of spike-timing dependent plasticity (STDP) on the temporal patterns of\nsynchronization in a simple model.

Another calibration method uses a\ncamera, but the system error caused by the camera's parameters affects the\ncalibration accuracy of the kinematics of the robot arm. Therefore, this paper\nproposes a method for calibrating the geometric parameters of a kinematic model\nof a manipulator based on monocular vision. Firstly, the classic\nDenavit-Hartenberg(D-H) modeling method is used to establish the kinematic\nparameters of the manipulator. Secondly, nonlinear optimization and parameter\ncompensation are performed. The three-dimensional positions of the feature\npoints of the calibration plate under each manipulator attitude corresponding\nto the actual kinematic model and the classic D-H kinematic model are mapped\ninto the pixel coordinate system, and the sum of Euclidean distance errors of\nthe pixel coordinates of the two is used as the objective function to be\noptimized. The experimental results show that the pixel deviation of the end\npose corresponding to the optimized D-H kinematic model proposed in this paper\nand the end pose corresponding to the actual kinematic model in the pixel\ncoordinate system is 0.99 pixels. Compared with the 7.9 deviation pixels\nbetween the pixel coordinates calculated by the classic D-H kinematic model and\nthe actual pixel coordinates, the deviation is reduced by nearly 7 pixels for\nan 87% reduction in error.

Consequently the existing\nconvergence results do not provide a guarantee as to whether empirical risks\nbased on empirical data are reliable or not when the data contain some noise.\nIn this paper, we fill out the gap in a few steps. First, we derive moderate\nsufficient conditions under which the expected risk changes stably\n(continuously) against small perturbation of the probability distribution of\nthe underlying random variables and demonstrate how the cost function and\nkernel affect the stability. Second, we examine the difference between laws of\nthe statistical estimators of the expected optimal loss based on pure data and\ncontaminated data using Prokhorov metric and Kantorovich metric and derive some\nqualitative and quantitative statistical robustness results. Third, we identify\nappropriate metrics under which the statistical estimators are uniformly\nasymptotically consistent.

Existing deep learning methods assume repetitive actions are\nperformed in a fixed time-scale, which is invalid for the complex repetitive\nactions in real life. In this paper, we tailor a context-aware and\nscale-insensitive framework, to tackle the challenges in repetition counting\ncaused by the unknown and diverse cycle-lengths. Our approach combines two key\ninsights: (1) Cycle lengths from different actions are unpredictable that\nrequire large-scale searching, but, once a coarse cycle length is determined,\nthe variety between repetitions can be overcome by regression. (2) Determining\nthe cycle length cannot only rely on a short fragment of video but a contextual\nunderstanding. The first point is implemented by a coarse-to-fine cycle\nrefinement method. It avoids the heavy computation of exhaustively searching\nall the cycle lengths in the video, and, instead, it propagates the coarse\nprediction for further refinement in a hierarchical manner. We secondly propose\na bidirectional cycle length estimation method for a context-aware prediction.\nIt is a regression network that takes two consecutive coarse cycles as input,\nand predicts the locations of the previous and next repetitive cycles. To\nbenefit the training and evaluation of temporal repetition counting area, we\nconstruct a new and largest benchmark, which contains 526 videos with diverse\nrepetitive actions. Extensive experiments show that the proposed network\ntrained on a single dataset outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several\nbenchmarks, indicating that the proposed framework is general enough to capture\nrepetition patterns across domains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 May 2020 05:49:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-19"}

One of the main differences with the standard version of\nthis problem rests upon the fact that the criterion to minimize does not write\nas the minimum of an energy, and thus most of the usual tools to analyze this\nproblem cannot be used. By using a relaxed version of this problem, we first\nprove the existence of optimal shapes under several assumptions on the problem\nparameters. We then analyze the stability of the ball, expected to be a good\ncandidate for solving the shape optimization problem, when the coefficients of\nthe involved PDE are radially symmetric.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 May 2020 07:26:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-19"}

Then, we consider a kind of symmetric prior,\npermutation equivariance, which widely exists in wireless tasks. To explain how\nsuch a generic prior is harnessed to improve learning efficiency, we resort to\nranking, which jointly sorts the input and output of a DNN.

In non-autoregressive models,\nadditional durations of text tokens are required to make a hard alignment\nbetween the encoder and the decoder. The duration-based alignment plays a\ncrucial role since it controls the correspondence between text tokens and\nspectrum frames and determines the rhythm and speed of synthesized audio. To\nget better duration-based alignment and improve the quality of\nnon-autoregressive speech synthesis, in this paper, we propose a novel neural\nalignment model named MoboAligner. Given the pairs of the text and mel\nspectrum, MoboAligner tries to identify the boundaries of text tokens in the\ngiven mel spectrum frames based on the token-frame similarity in the neural\nsemantic space with an end-to-end framework. With these boundaries, durations\ncan be extracted and used in the training of non-autoregressive TTS models.\nCompared with the duration extracted by TransformerTTS, MoboAligner brings\nimprovement for the non-autoregressive TTS model on MOS (3.74 comparing to\nFastSpeech's 3.44). Besides, MoboAligner is task-specified and lightweight,\nwhich reduces the parameter number by 45% and the training time consuming by\n30%.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 May 2020 08:36:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Jun 2020 05:01:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-11"}

Our results show that, in the hard-core limit, there exists a\nrung-pair localization both at the edges and in the bulk. Using center-of-mass\nframe, the two-particle system can be mapped to an effective single-particle\nsystem with an approximate sub-lattice symmetry. Under the condition of\nhard-core limit, the effective system is forced to have a defect at the left\nedge leading to a zero-energy flat band, which is the origin of the rung-pair\nlocalization. We also study the multi-particle dynamics of the Bose-Hubbard\nladder model, which is beyond the singleparticle picture. In this case, we find\nthat the localization can still survive despite of the existence of interaction\nbetween the pairs. Moreover, the numerical results show that the entanglement\nentropy exhibits a long-time logarithmic growth and the saturated values\nsatisfy a volume law. This phenomenon implies that the interaction plays an\nimportant role during the dynamics, although it cannot break the localization.\nOur results reveal another interesting type of disorder-free localization\nrelated to a zero-energy flat band, which is induced by on-site interaction and\nspecific lattice symmetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 May 2020 08:40:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 4 Aug 2020 12:40:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 2020 13:49:33 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2020 12:26:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-21"}

Estimation of this relationship requires clinical\ninformation on injury severity, patient demographics, and healthcare\nutilization, which are often obtained from separate data sources. Because of\nprivacy and confidentiality regulations, these data sources do not include\nunique identifiers to link records across data sources. Record linkage is a\nprocess to identify records that represent the same entity across data sources\nin the absence of unique identifiers. These processes commonly rely on\nagreement between variables that appear in both data sources to link records.\nHowever, when the number of records in each file is large, this task is\ncomputationally intensive and may result in false links. Blocking is a data\npartitioning technique that reduces the number of possible links that should be\nconsidered. Healthcare providers can be used as blocks in applications of\nrecord linkage with healthcare datasets. However, providers may not be uniquely\nidentified across files. We propose a Bayesian record linkage procedure that\nsimultaneously performs block-level and record-level linkage. This iterative\napproach incorporates the record-level linkage within block pairs to improve\nthe accuracy of the block-level linkage. Subsequently, the algorithm improves\nrecord-level linkage using the accurate partitioning of the linkage space\nthrough blocking. We demonstrate that our proposed method provides improved\nperformance compared to existing Bayesian record linkage methods that do not\nincorporate blocking. The proposed procedure is then used to merge registry\ndata from the National Trauma Data Bank with Medicare claims data to estimate\nthe relationship between injury severity and TBI patients' recovery.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 May 2020 09:32:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-19"}

However, the performance of the current\nstate-of-the-art facial expression recognition (FER) approaches is directly\nrelated to the labeled data for training. To solve this issue, prior works\nemploy the pretrain-and-finetune strategy, i.e., utilize a large amount of\nunlabeled data to pretrain the network and then finetune it by the labeled\ndata. As the labeled data is in a small amount, the final network performance\nis still restricted. From a different perspective, we propose to perform\nomni-supervised learning to directly exploit reliable samples in a large amount\nof unlabeled data for network training. Particularly, a new dataset is firstly\nconstructed using a primitive model trained on a small number of labeled\nsamples to select samples with high confidence scores from a face dataset,\ni.e., MS-Celeb-1M, based on feature-wise similarity. We experimentally verify\nthat the new dataset created in such an omni-supervised manner can\nsignificantly improve the generalization ability of the learned FER model.\nHowever, as the number of training samples grows, computational cost and\ntraining time increase dramatically. To tackle this, we propose to apply a\ndataset distillation strategy to compress the created dataset into several\ninformative class-wise images, significantly improving the training efficiency.\nWe have conducted extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks, where\nconsistent performance gains can be achieved under various settings using the\nproposed framework.

In the slow motion approximation\nof relativistic dynamics, the evolution of weakly nonlinear EM envelope is\ndescribed by the generalized nonlinear Schr{\\\"o}dinger (GNLS) equation with\nlocal and nonlocal nonlinearities. Using the Vakhitov-Kolokolov criteria, the\nstability of an EM soliton solution of the GNLS equation is studied. Different\nstable and unstable regions are demonstrated with the effects of soliton\nvelocity, soliton eigenfrequency, as well as the degeneracy parameter\n$R=p_{Fe}/m_ec$, where $p_{Fe}$ is the Fermi momentum and $m_e$ the electron\nmass, and $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum. It is found that the stability\nregion shifts to an unstable one and is significantly reduced as one enters\nfrom the regimes of weakly relativistic $(R\\ll1)$ to ultrarelativistic\n$(R\\gg1)$ degeneracy of electrons. The analytically predicted results are in\ngood agreement with the simulation results of the GNLS equation. It is shown\nthat the standing EM soliton solutions are stable. However, the moving solitons\ncan be stable or unstable depending on the values of soliton velocity, the\neigenfrequency or the degeneracy parameter. The latter with strong degeneracy\n$(R>1)$ can eventually lead to soliton collapse.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 May 2020 10:26:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Oct 2020 16:36:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-22"}

By taking these effects into account through an inhomogeneous spin-orbit\ncoupling profile, we show that in general two types of bound states arise in\nthe nanowire, namely confinement bound states and interface bound states. The\nappearance of confinement bound states, related to the finite length of the\nnanowire, is favoured by a mismatch of the bulk band bottoms characterizing the\nlead and the nanowire, and occurs even in the absence of magnetic field. In\ncontrast, an interface bound states may only appear if a magnetic field applied\nperpendicularly to the spin-orbit field direction overcomes a critical value,\nand is favoured by an alignment of the band bottoms of the two regions across\nthe interface. We describe in details the emergence of these two types of bound\nstates, pointing out their differences.

The\nspatial partitions defined by our indexing scheme are totally independent,\nfacilitating effortless parallel evaluation, as no synchronization or\ncommunication between the partitions is necessary. We show how our index can be\nused to efficiently process spatial range queries and drastically reduce the\ncost of the refinement step of the queries.

Useful properties of the operator are derived. By casting the problem in\nan eigenvalue problem form, the equivalency between solutions at different\npositions along the structure is demonstrated. It is shown that the underlying\nmathematical machinery is identical to the one used in the analysis of linear\ntime invariant periodic structures, where a two step eigen-decompositions is\nperformed. The first decomposition is in the temporal eigenfunctions basis,\nwhich is followed by the decomposition of the translation operator in the\nspatial domain. The two step process results in the well-known dispersion\nrelation. We also prove that all points in the ($\\beta$,$\\omega$) plane\nparallel to the modulation velocity are equivalent in the sense that the\neigenvectors are related by a shift operator. Additionally, the wave\npropagation inside the space time periodic circuit and the terminal\ncharacteristics are rigorously determined via the expansion of the total\nsolution in terms of the eigenmodes. To validate the developed framework, two\nexamples are provided. In the first, a space time modulated composite right\nleft handed transmission line is studied and results are compared with time\ndomain simulation. The second example is concerned with the characterization of\nthe non-reciprocal behaviour observed on a nonlinear transmission line that was\nmanufactured in our lab. Using the developed machinery it is shown that the\npassive interaction between different harmonics results in an observed giant\nnon-reciprocity, where the difference between the forward and backward\ntransmission coefficients can be greater than 30 dB. The frequencies at which\nnon-reciprocity occurs and its strength agree with time domain simulation and\nmeasurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 May 2020 12:00:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 23 Aug 2020 11:55:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-25"}

In this paper we define the largest sample of RETs to date,\ncomprising 106 objects from the Dark Energy Survey, and perform the most\ncomprehensive analysis of RET host galaxies. Using deep-stacked photometry and\nemission-lines from OzDES spectroscopy, we derive stellar masses and\nstar-formation rates (SFRs) for 49 host galaxies, and metallicities for 37. We\nfind that RETs explode exclusively in star-forming galaxies and are thus likely\nassociated with massive stars. Comparing RET hosts to samples of host galaxies\nof other explosive transients as well as field galaxies, we find that RETs\nprefer galaxies with high specific SFRs, indicating a link to young stellar\npopulations, similar to stripped-envelope SNe. RET hosts appear to show a lack\nof chemical enrichment, their metallicities akin to long duration gamma-ray\nbursts and superluminous SN host galaxies. There are no clear relationships\nbetween properties of the host galaxies and the peak magnitudes or decline\nrates of the transients themselves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 May 2020 12:37:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-07"}

To this end, a local linear stability is proposed for a flag in\naxial uniform flow and parallel to a free surface, using one-dimensional beam\nand potential flow models to revisit this classical fluid-structure interaction\nproblem. The physical behaviour of the confining free surface is characterized\nby the Froude number, corresponding to the ratio of the incoming flow velocity\nto that of the gravity waves. After presenting the simplified limit of infinite\nspan (i.e. two-dimensional problem), the results are generalized to include\nfinite-span and lateral confinement effects. In both cases, three unstable\nregimes are identified for varying Froude number. Rigidly-confined flutter is\nobserved for low Froude number, i.e. when the free surface behaves as a rigid\nwall, and is equivalent to the classical problem of the confined flag. When the\nflow and wave velocities are comparable, a new instability is observed before\nthe onset of flutter (i.e. at lower reduced flow speed) and results from the\nresonance of a structural bending wave and one of the fundamental modes of\nsurface gravity waves. Finally, for large Froude number (low effect of\ngravity), flutter is observed with significant but passive deformation of the\nfree surface in response of the flag's displacement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 May 2020 12:55:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-01"}

Faint sources, however,\nare not automatically checked for variability, thus overlooking faint, short\ntimescale transients. Our goal is to find new faint, fast transients in\nXMM-Newton EPIC-pn observations. To that end we have created the EPIC-pn\nXMM-Newton Outburst Detector (EXOD) algorithm, which we run on the EPIC-pn data\navailable in the 3XMM-DR8 catalogue. In EXOD, we compute the whole-field\nvariability by binning in time the counts in each detector pixel. We next\ncompute the maximum-to-median count difference in each pixel to detect\nvariability. We applied EXOD to 5,751 observations and compared the variability\nof the detected sources to the standard chi-square and Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS)\nvariability tests. The algorithm is able to detect periodic and aperiodic\nvariability, short and long flares. Of the sources detected by EXOD, 60-95% are\nalso shown to be variable by the chi-square and KS tests. We obtain a net\nnumber of 2,536 variable sources. Of these we investigate the nature of 35\nsources with no previously confirmed classification. Amongst the new sources,\nwe find stellar flares and AGNs; but also four extragalactic type I X-ray\nbursters that double the known neutron-star population in M31. This algorithm\nis a powerful tool to promptly detect variable sources in XMM-Newton\nobservations. EXOD detects fast transients that other variability tests\nclassify as non-variable due to their short duration and low number of counts.\nFinally, EXOD allows us to detect and identify the nature of rare compact\nobjects through their variability. We demonstrate this through the discovery of\nfour extragalactic neutron-star low mass X-ray binaries, doubling the number of\nknown neutron stars in M31.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 May 2020 13:00:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-26"}

We focus on the only mathematical\nassumption of the Backus average, namely, product approximation. It states that\nthe average of the product of a varying function with nearly-constant function\nis approximately equal to the product of the averages of those functions.

This paper proposes a deep learning model for real-time\nsegmentation of heartbeats. Methods: The proposed algorithm, named as the\nDENS-ECG algorithm, combines convolutional neural network (CNN) and long\nshort-term memory (LSTM) model to detect onset, peak, and offset of different\nheartbeat waveforms such as the P-wave, QRS complex, T-wave, and No wave (NW).\nUsing ECG as the inputs, the model learns to extract high level features\nthrough the training process, which, unlike other classical machine learning\nbased methods, eliminates the feature engineering step. Results: The proposed\nDENS-ECG model was trained and validated on a dataset with 105 ECGs of length\n15 minutes each and achieved an average sensitivity and precision of 97.95% and\n95.68%, respectively, using a 5-fold cross validation.

Thus, we attempt to establish a unified dynamo action, being\npotentially at work at widely varying stellar domains. Thus, the powerful,\nunique and leading entity generating the primary stellar magnetic field remains\nthe so-called Torus structure. Within the Torus the same sign charges are\nmutually attracted and the Torus could be simulated as a superconductor. An\nexisting gradient of the rotation rate accumulates net charge in the Torus, and\nthe resulting toroidal current becomes the driving source of the magnetic\nfield. In turn, there is a complicated network of secondary interactions that\naffect and modulate the whole star's magnetic behaviour. Our dynamo action is\npotentially at work in fully and partly convecting stars. A major finding is\nthat the strength of the magnetic field, for stars of the same spectral type,\nis essentially controlled by the size of the star; we suggest that, the larger\nthe star, the deeper inward the Torus is formed. The formation of a single\nTorus is essentially associated with a large-scale strong, poloidal and\naxisymmetric magnetic field topology, whereas the generation of a weaker\nmultipolar, non-axisymmetric field configuration in rapid evolution can result\nfrom a double-Torus structure (like the solar case).

The [O\nIV]-to-nuclear-12 $\\mu$m luminosity ratios are larger than those of typical\nSeyferts, which are consistent with the torus covering factors ($C_{\\rm T}\n\\lesssim$ 0.7) estimated from the torus angular widths and column densities by\nX-ray spectroscopy. The torus covering factors and Eddington ratios\n($\\lambda_{\\rm Edd} \\sim$ 0.1) follow the relation found by Ricci et al.\n(2017c) for local AGNs, implying that their tori become geometrically thin due\nto significant radiation pressure of the AGN that blows out some part of the\ntori. These results indicate that the CT AGNs in these \"non-merger\" LIRGs are\njust a normal AGN population seen edge-on through a large line-of-sight column\ndensity. They are in contrast to the buried CT AGNs in late-stage mergers that\nhave large torus covering factors even at large Eddington ratios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 May 2020 13:53:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-15"}

This\nproposed technique is termed Polymer on Polymer Pollutant Removal (PoPPR),\nwhich utilizes the elastic properties of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) to\nphysically remove contaminants from contact lens surfaces through non-adhesive\nunpeeling.\n  Methods: Three different ratios of setting agent to polymer PDMS (1:30, 1:40,\nand 1:50) were evaluated using the PoPPR method against the control method of\nRR with a commercial multi-purpose lens cleaning solution. Three simulated\npollutants of different sizes: pollen (25-40 {\\mu}m), microbeads (1-5 {\\mu}m),\nand nanoparticles (5-10 nm), were used to test the effectiveness of both\ncleaning methods. The fraction of pollutants removed from each contact lens was\nrecorded and evaluated for significance.\n  Results: PDMS 1:40 was found to be the optimal ratio for lens cleaning using\nthe PoPPR method. For larger particles (>10 {\\mu}m), no difference was observed\nbetween conventional RR and proposed PoPPR method (p > 0.05). However, the new\nPoPPR technique was significantly better at removing small PM2.5 particles\n(<2.5 {\\mu}m) compared to the RR method, specifically for microbeads (p =\n0.006) and nanoparticles (p < 0.001).\n  Conclusion: This proof-of-concept work demonstrates that the PoPPR method of\ncleaning contact lenses is as effective as the conventional cleaning method for\nlarger particles such as pollen. The PoPPR method is more effective at removing\nextremely fine particulate pollutants, including microplastics and\nnanoparticles. This method offers a potentially more efficient cleaning\nprotocol that could enhance the safety, health, and comfort of contact lens\nusers, especially those living in regions with significant air pollution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 May 2020 14:04:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-21"}

As the host star is occulted\nby the coronagraph, a speckle grid (SG) is introduced to serve as astrometric\nand photometric reference. Speckle grids are implemented as diffractive\npupil-plane optics that generate artificial speckles at known location and\nbrightness. Their performance is limited by the underlying speckle halo caused\nby evolving uncorrected wavefront errors. The speckle halo will interfere with\nthe coherent SGs, affecting their photometric and astrometric precision. Our\naim is to show that by imposing opposite amplitude or phase modulation on the\nopposite polarization states, a SG can be instantaneously incoherent with the\nunderlying halo, greatly increasing the precision. We refer to these as vector\nspeckle grids (VSGs). We derive analytically the mechanism by which the\nincoherency arises and explore the performance gain in idealised simulations\nunder various atmospheric conditions. We show that the VSG is completely\nincoherent for unpolarized light and that the fundamental limiting factor is\nthe cross-talk between the speckles in the grid.

However, there has been limited technical development focusing on\nsingle hyperspectral image super-resolution due to the high-dimensional and\ncomplex spectral patterns in hyperspectral image. In this paper, we make a step\nforward by investigating how to adapt state-of-the-art residual learning based\nsingle gray/RGB image super-resolution approaches for computationally efficient\nsingle hyperspectral image super-resolution, referred as SSPSR. Specifically,\nwe introduce a spatial-spectral prior network (SSPN) to fully exploit the\nspatial information and the correlation between the spectra of the\nhyperspectral data. Considering that the hyperspectral training samples are\nscarce and the spectral dimension of hyperspectral image data is very high, it\nis nontrivial to train a stable and effective deep network. Therefore, a group\nconvolution (with shared network parameters) and progressive upsampling\nframework is proposed. This will not only alleviate the difficulty in feature\nextraction due to high-dimension of the hyperspectral data, but also make the\ntraining process more stable. To exploit the spatial and spectral prior, we\ndesign a spatial-spectral block (SSB), which consists of a spatial residual\nmodule and a spectral attention residual module. Experimental results on some\nhyperspectral images demonstrate that the proposed SSPSR method enhances the\ndetails of the recovered high-resolution hyperspectral images, and outperforms\nstate-of-the-arts.

In this paper, we address the design of feedforward controllers for a\ngeneral class of $2 \\times 2$ hyperbolic systems with a single disturbance\ninput located at one boundary and a single control actuation at the other\nboundary. The goal is to design a feedforward control that makes the system\noutput insensitive to the measured disturbance input. We show that, for this\nclass of systems, there exists an efficient ideal feedforward controller which\nis causal and stable. The problem is first stated and studied in the frequency\ndomain for a simple linear system. Then, our main contribution is to show how\nthe theory can be extended, in the time domain, to general nonlinear hyperbolic\nsystems. The method is illustrated with an application to the control of an\nopen channel represented by Saint- Venant equations where the objective is to\nmake the output water level insensitive to the variations of the input flow\nrate. Finally, we address a more complex application to a cascade of pools\nwhere a blind application of perfect feedforward control can lead to\ndetrimental oscillations. A pragmatic way of modifying the control law to solve\nthis problem is proposed and validated with a simulation experiment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 May 2020 14:28:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-20"}

Compared with the traditional\nsingle LG rotational cavity, an asymmetric optomechanically induced\ntransparency window can occur in our system. Meanwhile, the position of the\nresonance valley has a strong correlation with the magnitude and sign of OAM.\nThis originally comes from the fact that the effective detuning of the cavity\nmode from the driving field can vary with the magnitude and sign of OAM, which\ncauses the spectral shift to be directional for different signs of OAM. Our\nscheme solves the shortcoming of the inability to distinguish the sign of OAM\nin optomechanics, and works well for high-order vortex beams with topological\ncharge value $\\pm 45$, which is a significant improvement for measuring OAM\nbased on the cavity optomechanical system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 May 2020 14:33:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 May 2020 08:09:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2020 08:13:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-19"}

Most existing works address keyword spotting as a\nclosed-set classification problem, where both target and non-target keywords\nare predefined. Therefore, prevailing classifier-based keyword spotting systems\nperform poorly on non-target sounds which are unseen during the training stage,\ncausing high false alarm rates in real-world scenarios. In reality, keyword\nspotting is a detection problem where predefined target keywords are detected\nfrom a variety of unknown sounds. This shares many similarities to metric\nlearning problems in that the unseen and unknown non-target sounds must be\nclearly differentiated from the target keywords.

Among asynchronous, randomized, and signature-free implementations,\nthe protocols of Most\\'efaoui et al. (PODC 2014 and JACM 2015) represent a\nlandmark result, which has been extended later and taken up in practical\nsystems. The protocols achieve optimal resilience and takes, in expectation,\nonly a constant expected number of rounds of quadratic message complexity.\nRandomization is provided through a common-coin primitive. In traditional\nconsensus protocols, all involved processes adhere to a global, symmetric\nfailure model, typically only defined by bounds on the number of faulty\nprocesses. Motivated by applications to blockchains, however, more flexible\ntrust assumptions have recently been considered. In particular, with asymmetric\ntrust, a process is free to choose which other processes it trusts and which\nones might collude against it. This paper revisits the optimal asynchronous\nprotocol of Most\\'efaoui et al. and shows how to realize it with asymmetric\ntrust. The paper starts by pointing out in detail why some versions of this\nprotocol may violate liveness.

A significant saving in storage can be achieved by\nusing various machine-learning techniques that represent the thermo-chemical\nquantities of a PDF table using mathematical functions. These functions can be\ncomputationally more expensive than the existing interpolation methods used for\nthermo-chemical quantities.

In this work, we address these\nissues by introducing an adaptive training algorithm that relies on multi-layer\nperception (MLP) neural networks for regression and self-organizing maps (SOMs)\nfor clustering data to tabulate using different networks. The algorithm is\ndesigned to address both the multi-dimensionality of the PDF table as well as\nthe computational efficiency of the proposed algorithm. SOM clustering divides\nthe PDF table into several parts based on similarities in data. Each cluster of\ndata is trained using an MLP algorithm on simple network architectures to\ngenerate local functions for thermo-chemical quantities. The algorithm is\nvalidated for the so-called DLR-A turbulent jet diffusion flame using both RANS\nand LES simulations and the results of the PDF tabulation are compared to the\nstandard linear interpolation method. The comparison yields a very good\nagreement between the two tabulation techniques and establishes the MLP-SOM\napproach as a viable method for PDF tabulation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 May 2020 00:13:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-21"}

Earlier works treated programs as text so\nthat natural language methods can be readily applied. Unfortunately, such\napproaches do not capitalize on the rich structural information possessed by\nsource code. Of late, Graph Neural Network (GNN) was proposed to learn\nembeddings of programs from their graph representations. Due to the homogeneous\nand expensive message-passing procedure, GNN can suffer from precision issues,\nespecially when dealing with programs rendered into large graphs. In this\npaper, we present a new graph neural architecture, called Graph Interval Neural\nNetwork (GINN), to tackle the weaknesses of the existing GNN. Unlike the\nstandard GNN, GINN generalizes from a curated graph representation obtained\nthrough an abstraction method designed to aid models to learn. In particular,\nGINN focuses exclusively on intervals for mining the feature representation of\na program, furthermore, GINN operates on a hierarchy of intervals for scaling\nthe learning to large graphs. We evaluate GINN for two popular downstream\napplications: variable misuse prediction and method name prediction. Results\nshow in both cases GINN outperforms the state-of-the-art models by a\ncomfortable margin. We have also created a neural bug detector based on GINN to\ncatch null pointer deference bugs in Java code. While learning from the same\n9,000 methods extracted from 64 projects, GINN-based bug detector significantly\noutperforms GNN-based bug detector on 13 unseen test projects. Next, we deploy\nour trained GINN-based bug detector and Facebook Infer to scan the codebase of\n20 highly starred projects on GitHub. Through our manual inspection, we confirm\n38 bugs out of 102 warnings raised by GINN-based bug detector compared to 34\nbugs out of 129 warnings for Facebook Infer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 May 2020 02:38:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 May 2020 02:11:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-28"}

Studying the stability of dynamic\nsystems is critical, but analyzing the stability of time-delay systems is\nchallenging because DDEs are infinite-dimensional. We propose a new approach to\nquickly generate stability charts for DDEs using continuation of characteristic\nroots (CCR). In our CCR method, the roots of the characteristic equation of a\nDDE are written as implicit functions of the parameters of interest, and the\ncontinuation equations are derived in the form of ordinary differential\nequations (ODEs). Numerical continuation is then employed to determine the\ncharacteristic roots at all points in a parametric space; the stability of the\noriginal DDE can then be easily determined. A key advantage of the proposed\nmethod is that a system of linearly independent ODEs is solved rather than the\ntypical strategy of solving a large eigenvalue problem at each grid point in\nthe domain. Thus, the CCR method significantly reduces the computational effort\nrequired to determine the stability of DDEs. As we demonstrate with several\nexamples, the CCR method generates highly accurate stability charts, and does\nso up to 10 times faster than the Galerkin approximation method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 May 2020 06:21:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-22"}

As an organism\nages its immune system undergoes immunosenescence, characterized by declined\nperformance or malfunction in either immune branch, which can lead to disease\nand death. In this study we develop a mathematical framework of coupled innate\nand adaptive immune responses, namely the integrated immune branch (IIB) model.\nThis model describes dynamics of immune components in both branches, uses a\nshape-space representation to encode pathogen-specific immune memory, and\nexhibits three steady states -- health, septic death, and chronic inflammation\n-- qualitatively similar to clinically-observed immune outcomes. In this model,\nthe immune system (initialized in the health state) is subjected to a sequence\nof pathogen encounters, and we use the number of prior pathogen encounters as a\nproxy for the \"age\" of the immune system. We find that repeated pathogen\nencounters may trigger a fragility in which any encounter with a novel pathogen\nwill cause the system to irreversibly switch from health to chronic\ninflammation. This transition is consistent with the onset of \"inflammaging\", a\ncondition observed in aged individuals who experience chronic low-grade\ninflammation even in the absence of pathogens. The IIB model predicts that the\nonset of chronic inflammation strongly depends on the history of encountered\npathogens; the timing of onset differs drastically when the same set of\ninfections occurs in a different order. Lastly, the coupling between the innate\nand adaptive immune branches generates a trade-off between rapid pathogen\nclearance and a delayed onset of immunosenescence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 18 May 2020 01:10:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 26 Aug 2020 21:28:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-28"}
