The design rules related to reliability\ndepend on the process technology being used and the expected operating\nconditions of the device. To meet reliability requirements, advanced process\ntechnologies (28 nm and below) impose highly challenging design rules. Such\ndesign-for-reliability rules have become a major burden on the flow of VLSI\nimplementation because of the severe physical constraints they impose.\n  This paper focuses on electromigration (EM), which is one of the major\ncritical factors affecting semiconductor reliability. EM is the aging process\nof on-die wires and vias and is induced by excessive current flow that can\ndamage wires and may also significantly impact the integrated-circuit clock\nfrequency. EM exerts a comprehensive global effect on devices because it\nimpacts wires that may reside inside the standard or custom logical cells,\nbetween logical cells, inside memory elements, and within wires that\ninterconnect functional blocks.\n  The design-implementation flow (synthesis and place-and-route) currently\ndetects violations of EM-reliability rules and attempts to solve them. In\ncontrast, this paper proposes a new approach to enhance these flows by using\nEM-aware architecture. Our results show that the proposed solution can relax EM\ndesign efforts in microprocessors and more than double microprocessor lifetime.\nThis work demonstrates this proposed approach for modern microprocessors,\nalthough the principals and ideas can be adapted to other cases as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 May 2020 16:06:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Sep 2020 05:22:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 13 Sep 2021 16:32:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-14"}

The purpose is to use this solution to fit the data of the 2016\nVela glitch by employing a Bayesian approach and to obtain a probability\ndistribution for the physical parameters of the model and for observational\nparameters, such as the glitch rise time and the relaxation timescale. The fit\nis achieved through Bayesian inference.

Permanent shifts away from transit and carpooling can add\nvehicles to congested road networks, increasing travel times. Growth in the\nnumber of workers who avoid commuting and work from home instead can offset\ntravel time increases. To estimate these potential impacts, 6-9 years of\nAmerican Community Survey commute data for 118 metropolitan statistical areas\nare investigated. For 74 of the metro areas, the average commute travel time is\nshown to be explainable using only the number of passenger vehicles used for\ncommuting. A universal Bureau of Public Roads model characterizes the\nsensitivity of each metro area with respect to additional vehicles. The\nresulting models are then used to determine the change in average travel time\nfor each metro area in scenarios when 25\\% or 50\\% of transit and carpool users\nswitch to single occupancy vehicles. Under a 25\\% mode shift, areas such as San\nFrancisco and New York that are already congested and have high transit\nridership may experience round trip travel time increases of 12 minutes (New\nYork) to 20 minutes (San Francisco), costing individual commuters \\$1065 and\n\\$1601 annually in lost time. The travel time increases and corresponding costs\ncan be avoided with an increase in working from home. The main contribution of\nthis work is to provide a model to quantify the potential increase in commute\ntravel times under various behavior changes, that can aid policy making for\nmore efficient commuting.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 May 2020 16:15:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Mar 2023 00:35:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-03"}

These slow variables are\nknown as reaction coordinates in molecular dynamical applications, where they\nplay a key role in system analysis and coarse graining. The defining\ncharacteristics of these slow variables is that they parametrize a so-called\ntransition manifold, a low-dimensional manifold in a certain density function\nspace that emerges with progressive equilibration of the system's fast\nvariables. The existence of said manifold was previously predicted for certain\nclasses of metastable and slow-fast systems.

We first discuss\nexistence and uniqueness of seed bank SPDEs and provide an equivalent delay\nrepresentation that allows a clear interpretation of the age structure in the\nseed bank component.

Previous studies\nfrom the HAbitable Zones and M dwarf Activity across Time (HAZMAT) program\nshowed the far- and near-UV (FUV, NUV) emission from M stars at various stages\nof a stellar lifetime through photometric measurements from the Galaxy\nEvolution Explorer (GALEX). The results revealed increased levels of\nshort-wavelength emission that remain elevated for hundreds of millions of\nyears. The trend for EUV flux as a function of age could not be determined\nempirically because absorption by the interstellar medium prevents access to\nthe EUV wavelengths for the vast majority of stars.

We\npresent synthetic spectra spanning EUV to infrared wavelengths of 0.4 $\\pm$\n0.05 M$_{\\odot}$ stars at five distinct ages between 10 and 5000 Myr, computed\nwith the PHOENIX atmosphere code and guided by the GALEX photometry. We model a\nrange of EUV fluxes spanning two orders of magnitude, consistent with the\nobserved spread in X-ray, FUV, and NUV flux at each epoch. Our results show\nthat the stellar EUV emission from young M stars is 100 times stronger than\nfield age M stars, and decreases as t$^{-1}$ after remaining constant for a few\nhundred million years. This decline stems from changes in the chromospheric\ntemperature structure, which steadily shifts outward with time. Our models\nreconstruct the full spectrally and temporally resolved history of an M star's\nUV radiation, including the unobservable EUV radiation, which drives planetary\natmospheric escape, directly impacting a planet's potential for habitability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 May 2020 17:43:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-27"}

However, it is a\nchallenging task given the complex patterns of commuting flows. Conventional\nmodels, such as gravity model, are mainly derived from physics principles and\nlimited by their predictive power in real-world scenarios where many factors\nneed to be considered. Meanwhile, most existing machine learning-based methods\nignore the spatial correlations and fail to model the influence of nearby\nregions. To address these issues, we propose Geo-contextual Multitask Embedding\nLearner (GMEL), a model that captures the spatial correlations from geographic\ncontextual information for commuting flow prediction. Specifically, we first\nconstruct a geo-adjacency network containing the geographic contextual\ninformation. Then, an attention mechanism is proposed based on the framework of\ngraph attention network (GAT) to capture the spatial correlations and encode\ngeographic contextual information to embedding space. Two separate GATs are\nused to model supply and demand characteristics. A multitask learning framework\nis used to introduce stronger restrictions and enhance the effectiveness of the\nembedding representation. Finally, a gradient boosting machine is trained based\non the learned embeddings to predict commuting flows. We evaluate our model\nusing real-world datasets from New York City and the experimental results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal against the state of the art.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 May 2020 17:45:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-08-25"}

In the framework of the DustPedia project we have set out to\ndisentangle the radiation of the ongoing star formation from that of the older\nstellar populations. This is done through detailed, 3D radiative transfer\nsimulations of face-on spiral galaxies. In this particular study, we focus on\nNGC 1068, which contains an active galactic nucleus (AGN). The effect of\ndiffuse dust heating by AGN (beyond the torus) was so far only investigated for\nquasars. This additional dust heating source further contaminates the broadband\nfluxes on which classic galaxy modelling tools rely to derive physical\nproperties. We aim to fit a realistic model to the observations of NGC 1068 and\nquantify the contribution of the several dust heating sources. Our model is\nable to reproduce the global spectral energy distribution of the galaxy. It\nmatches the resolved optical and infrared images fairly well, but deviates in\nthe UV and the submm. We find a strong wavelength dependency of AGN\ncontamination to the broadband fluxes. It peaks in the MIR, drops in the FIR,\nbut rises again at submm wavelengths. We quantify the contribution of the dust\nheating sources in each 3D dust cell and find a median value of 83% for the\nstar formation component. The AGN contribution is measurable at the percentage\nlevel in the disc, but quickly increases in the inner few 100 pc, peaking above\n90%. This is the first time the phenomenon of an AGN heating the diffuse dust\nbeyond its torus is quantified in a nearby star-forming galaxy. NGC 1068 only\ncontains a weak AGN, meaning this effect can be stronger in galaxies with a\nmore luminous AGN.

It shows that although mounting evidence supports that MA\nmay extend to late-type HAes but not to early-type HBes, there is not yet a\nconsensus on the validity of this scenario versus the BL one. Based on MA and\nBL shock modeling, it is argued that the ultraviolet regime could significantly\ncontribute in the future to discriminating between these competing accretion\nscenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 May 2020 18:00:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-08"}

In binary neutron star (BNS) mergers it is of\nspecial importance due to the role that it plays in the measurement of the\nHubble constant, $H_0$. The opening angle of the jet that these mergers launch,\n$\\theta_j$, is also of special interest. Following the detection of the first\nBNS merger, GW170817, there were numerous attempts to estimate these angles\nusing the afterglow light curve, finding a wide range of values. Here we\nprovide a simple formula for the ratio $\\theta_{\\rm obs}/\\theta_j$ based on the\nafterglow light curve and show that this is the only quantity that can be\ndetermined from the light curve alone. Namely, it is impossible to determine\neach of the angles separately without additional information. Our result\nexplains the inconsistency of the values found by the various studies of\nGW170817 that were largely driven by the different priors taken in each study.\nAmong the additional information that can be used to estimate $\\theta_{\\rm\nobs}$ and $\\theta_j$, the most useful is a VLBI measurement of the afterglow\nimage superluminal motion. An alternative is an identification of the afterglow\ntransition to the sub-relativistic phase. These observations are possible only\nfor mergers observed at small viewing angles, whose afterglow is significantly\nbrighter than the detector's threshold. We discuss the implications of these\nresults to measurements of $H_0$ using GW observations. We show that while the\nviewing angle will be measured only in a small fraction of future BNS mergers,\nit can significantly reduce the uncertainty in $H_0$ in each one of these\nevents, possibly to a level of 4-5\\%. A minority of the mergers with high\nprecision measurements of this kind may dominate in the future the precision in\nwhich $H_0$ will be measured using this method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 May 2020 18:01:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 12 Jan 2021 07:18:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-17"}

Mendelian randomization analyses which use variants from a single\ngenetic region (cis-MR) have gained popularity for being an economical way to\nprovide supporting evidence for drug target validation. This paper proposes\nmethods for cis-MR inference which use the explanatory power of many correlated\nvariants to make valid inferences even in situations where those variants only\nhave weak effects on the exposure. In particular, we exploit the highly\nstructured nature of genetic correlations in single gene regions to reduce the\ndimension of genetic variants using factor analysis.

Since these factors may often be weakly associated with the exposure,\nsize distortions of standard t-tests can be severe. Therefore, we consider two\napproaches based on conditional testing.

For practical implementation, opposition control is only realizable\nif there is a degree of coherence between the sensor--actuator pairs of the\ncontrol system (these sensors and actuators should typically be wall-based to\navoid parasitic drag). As such, we here inspect the feasibility of real-time\ncontrol of the near-wall cycle, by considering the coherence between a\nmeasurable wall-quantity, being the wall-shear stress fluctuations, and the\nstreamwise and wall-normal velocity fluctuations in a turbulent boundary layer.\nSynchronized spatial and temporal velocity data from numerical simulations at\n$Re_\\tau \\approx 590$ and $ 2000$ are employed. It is shown that the spectral\nenergy of the streamwise velocity fluctuations that is stochastically\nincoherent with wall signals is independent of Reynolds number in the near wall\nregion. Consequently, the streamwise energy-fraction that is stochastically\nwall-coherent grows with Reynolds number due to the increasing range of\nenergetic large scales. This thus implies that a wall-based control system has\nthe ability to manipulate a larger portion of the total turbulence energy at\noff-wall locations, at higher Reynolds numbers. Coherence values of 0.55 and\n0.4, which are considerably lower than the maximum possible coherence 1, were\nfound between the streamwise and wall-normal velocity fluctuations at the near\nwall peak in the energy spectrogram, respectively, and the streamwise\nfluctuating friction velocity.

We\nhypothesize that the failure of ML in making high-impacts in InfoSec are rooted\nin a disconnect between the two communities as evidenced by a semantic gap---a\ndifference in how executables are described (e.g. the data and features\nextracted from the data). Specifically, current datasets and representations\nused by ML are not suitable for learning the behaviors of an executable and\ndiffer significantly from those used by the InfoSec community. In this paper,\nwe survey existing datasets used for classifying malware by ML algorithms and\nthe features that are extracted from the data. We observe that: 1) the current\nset of extracted features are primarily syntactic, not behavioral, 2) datasets\ngenerally contain extreme exemplars producing a dataset in which it is easy to\ndiscriminate classes, and 3) the datasets provide significantly different\nrepresentations of the data encountered in real-world systems. For ML to make\nmore of an impact in the InfoSec community requires a change in the data\n(including the features and labels) that is used to bridge the current semantic\ngap.

Many works have shown that an SNN for inference can\nbe formed by copying the weights from a trained Artificial Neural Network (ANN)\nand setting the firing threshold for each layer as the maximum input received\nin that layer. These type of converted SNNs require a large number of time\nsteps to achieve competitive accuracy which diminishes the energy savings. The\nnumber of time steps can be reduced by training SNNs with spike-based\nbackpropagation from scratch, but that is computationally expensive and slow.\nTo address these challenges, we present a computationally-efficient training\ntechnique for deep SNNs. We propose a hybrid training methodology: 1) take a\nconverted SNN and use its weights and thresholds as an initialization step for\nspike-based backpropagation, and 2) perform incremental spike-timing dependent\nbackpropagation (STDB) on this carefully initialized network to obtain an SNN\nthat converges within few epochs and requires fewer time steps for input\nprocessing.

A complex computer code is an example of such a\nfunction. In this work, a Gaussian process (GP) emulator is used to approximate\nthe output of complex computer code. We consider the problem of extending an\ninitial experiment (set of model runs) sequentially to improve the emulator. A\nsequential sampling approach based on leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation is\nproposed that can be easily extended to a batch mode. This is a desirable\nproperty since it saves the user time when parallel computing is available.\nAfter fitting a GP to training data points, the expected squared LOO (ES-LOO)\nerror is calculated at each design point. ES-LOO is used as a measure to\nidentify important data points. More precisely, when this quantity is large at\na point it means that the quality of prediction depends a great deal on that\npoint and adding more samples nearby could improve the accuracy of the GP. As a\nresult, it is reasonable to select the next sample where ES-LOO is maximised.\nHowever, ES-LOO is only known at the experimental design and needs to be\nestimated at unobserved points. To do this, a second GP is fitted to the ES-LOO\nerrors and where the maximum of the modified expected improvement (EI)\ncriterion occurs is chosen as the next sample. EI is a popular acquisition\nfunction in Bayesian optimisation and is used to trade-off between local/global\nsearch. However, it has a tendency towards exploitation, meaning that its\nmaximum is close to the (current) \"best\" sample. To avoid clustering, a\nmodified version of EI, called pseudo expected improvement, is employed which\nis more explorative than EI yet allows us to discover unexplored regions.

One of\nour key contributions is a novel self-supervised training setup that only\nrequires a set of high-resolution meshes for learning network weights. For any\ntraining shape, we stochastically generate diverse low-resolution\ndiscretizations of coarse counterparts, while maintaining a bijective mapping\nthat prescribes the exact target position of every new vertex during the\nsubdivision process. This leads to a very efficient and accurate loss function\nfor conditional mesh generation, and enables us to train a method that\ngeneralizes across discretizations and favors preserving the manifold structure\nof the output. During training we optimize for the same set of network weights\nacross all local mesh patches, thus providing an architecture that is not\nconstrained to a specific input mesh, fixed genus, or category. Our network\nencodes patch geometry in a local frame in a rotation- and\ntranslation-invariant manner. Jointly, these design choices enable our method\nto generalize well, and we demonstrate that even when trained on a single\nhigh-resolution mesh our method generates reasonable subdivisions for novel\nshapes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 May 2020 20:03:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-06"}

The radial distribution of BSS,\nnormalized to a reference population, appears bimodal in a fraction of Galactic\nGCs, with a density peak in the core, a prominent zone of avoidance at\nintermediate radii, and again higher density in the outskirts. The zone of\navoidance appears to be located at larger radii the more relaxed the host\ncluster, acting as a sort of dynamical clock. We use a new method to compute\nthe evolution of the BSS radial distribution under dynamical friction and\ndiffusion. We evolve our BSS in the mean cluster potential under dynamical\nfriction plus a random fluctuating force, solving the Langevin equation with\nthe Mannella quasi symplectic scheme. This amounts to a new simulation method\nwhich is much faster and simpler than direct N-body codes but retains their\nmain feature: diffusion powered by strong, if infrequent, kicks. We compute the\nradial distribution of initially unsegregated BSS normalized to a reference\npopulation as a function of time. We trace the evolution of its minimum,\ncorresponding to the zone of avoidance. We compare the evolution under kicks\nextracted from a Gaussian distribution to that obtained using a Holtsmark\ndistribution. The latter is a fat tailed distribution which correctly models\nthe effects of close gravitational encounters. We find that the zone of\navoidance moves outwards over time, as expected based on observations, only\nwhen using the Holtsmark distribution. Thus the correct representation of near\nencounters is crucial to reproduce the dynamics of the system.

Here, we address this with a quantum router architecture\ncomprising many quantum memories connected in a photonic switchboard to broker\nentanglement flows across quantum networks. We compute the rate and fidelity of\nentanglement distribution under this architecture using an event-based\nsimulator, finding that the router improves the entanglement fidelity as\nmultiplexing depth increases without a significant drop in the entanglement\ndistribution rate.

Previously, we developed\na novel technique to fabricate such nanocomposites at room temperature using\nsolvent-driven infiltration of polymer (SIP) into NP packings. In the SIP\nprocess, a bilayer made of an underlying polymer film and a dense packing of\nNPs is exposed to solvent vapor which induces condensation of the solvent into\nthe voids of the packing. The condensed solvent plasticizes the underlying\npolymer film, inducing polymer infiltration into the solvent-filled voids in\nthe NP packing. In this work, we study the effect of confinement on the\nkinetics of SIP and the final partitioning of polymer into the interstices of\nthe NP packing. We find that, while the dynamics of infiltration during SIP are\nstrongly dependent on confinement, the final extent of infiltration is\nindependent of confinement. The time for infiltration obeys a power law with\nconfinement, as defined by the ratio of the chain size and the pore size.\nQualitatively, the observed time scale is attributed to changes in\nconcentration regimes as infiltration proceeds, which lead to shifting\ncharacteristic length scales in the system over time. When the concentration in\nthe pore exceeds the critical overlap concentration, the characteristic length\nscale of the polymer is no longer that of the entire chain, but rather the\ncorrelation length, which is smaller than the pore size. Therefore, at long\ntimes, the extent of infiltration is independent of the confinement ratio.\nFurthermore, favorable surface interactions between the polymer and the\nnanoparticles enhance partitioning into the NP packing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 May 2020 21:34:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-11"}

The latency for perceptual systems based on point cloud\ndata can be dominated by the amount of time for a complete rotational scan\n(e.g. 100 ms). This built-in data capture latency is artificial, and based on\ntreating the point cloud as a camera image in order to leverage camera-inspired\narchitectures.

The goal is to pack some of these\nitems such that they fill the knapsack as much as possible without ever\nexceeding the capacity. The online version of this problem reveals the items\nand their sizes not all at once but one by one. For each item, the algorithm\nhas to decide immediately whether to pack it or not. We consider a natural\nvariant of this online knapsack problem, which has been coined removable\nknapsack and we denote by RemKnap. It differs from the classical variant by\nallowing the removal of any packed item from the knapsack. Repacking is\nimpossible, however: Once an item is removed, it is gone for good.\n  We analyze the advice complexity of this problem. It measures how many advice\nbits an omniscient oracle needs to provide for an online algorithm to reach any\ngiven competitive ratio, which is--understood in its strict sense--just the\nalgorithm's approximation factor. The online knapsack problem without\nremovability is known for its peculiar advice behavior involving three jumps in\ncompetitivity. We show that the advice complexity of RemKnap is quite different\nbut just as interesting. The competitivity starts from the golden ratio when no\nadvice is given. It then drops down in small increments to (1 + epsilon) for a\nconstant amount of advice already, which requires logarithmic advice in the\nclassical version. Removability comes as no relief to the perfectionist,\nhowever: Optimality still requires one full advice bit for every single item in\nthe instance as before.\n  These results are particularly noteworthy from a structural viewpoint for the\nexceptionally slow transition from near-optimality to optimality; such a steep\njump up from constant to full linear advice for just an infinitesimally small\nimprovement is unique among the online problems examined so far.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 May 2020 22:00:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-06"}

This problem subsumes several applications of\nstateful pricing, including but not limited to posted prices for online job\nscheduling and matching over a dynamic bipartite graph. As the existing online\nlearning techniques do not yield vanishing-regret mechanisms for this problem,\nwe develop a novel online learning framework defined over deterministic Markov\ndecision processes with dynamic state transition and reward functions.

However, there has been no direct\ndetection of any AIC event so far, even though there exists a lot of indirect\nobservational evidence. Meanwhile, the evolutionary pathways resulting in NS\nformation through AIC are still not well investigated. In this article, we\nreview recent studies on the two classic progenitor models of AIC events, i.e.,\nthe single-degenerate model (including the ONe WD+MS/RG/He star channels and\nthe CO WD+He star channel) and the double-degenerate model (including the\ndouble CO/ONe WD channels and the ONe WD+CO WD channel). Recent progress on\nthese progenitor models is reviewed, including the evolutionary scenarios, the\ninitial parameter space and the related objects. For the single-degenerate\nmodel, the pre-AIC systems could potentially be identified as supersoft X-ray\nsources, symbiotics and cataclysmic variables, whereas the post-AIC systems\ncould be identified as low-/intermediate-mass X-ray binaries and the resulting\nlow-/intermediate-mass binary pulsars, most notably millisecond pulsars. For\nthe double-degenerate model, the pre-AIC systems are close double WDs, whereas\nthe post-AIC systems are isolated NSs with peculiar properties. We also review\nthe predicted rates of AIC events, the mass distribution of NSs, and the\ngravitational wave (GW) signals from double WDs that are potential GW sources\nin the Galaxy in the context of future space-based GW detectors.

In in\nvitro assays, JMV2009 exhibited high binding affinity for both NTS1 and NTS2,\nimproved proteolytic resistance as well as agonistic activities similar to NT,\ninducing sustained activation of p42/p44 MAPK and receptor internalization.\nIntrathecal injection of JMV2009 produced dose-dependent antinociceptive\nresponses in the tail-flick test and almost completely abolished the\nnociceptive-related behaviors induced by chemical somatic and visceral noxious\nstimuli. Likewise, increasing doses of JMV2009 significantly reduced tactile\nallodynia and weight bearing deficits in nerve-injured rats. Importantly,\nchronic agonist treatment did not result in the development of analgesic\ntolerance. Furthermore, JMV2009 did not cause constipation and was ineffective\nin inducing hypothermia. These findings suggest that NT drugs can act as an\neffective opioid-free medication for the management of pain or can serve as\nadjuvant analgesics to reduce the opioid adverse effects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 May 2020 23:41:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Jun 2020 19:02:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-06-14"}

However, the mechanisms\nunderlying this emotion contagion, for example, whether different feelings\nspread in unlikely ways or how the spread of emotions relates to the social\nnetwork, is rarely investigated. Indeed, because of high costs and\nspatio-temporal limitations, explorations of this topic are challenging using\nconventional questionnaires or controlled experiments. Because they are\ncollection points for natural affective responses of massive individuals,\nonline social media sites offer an ideal proxy for tackling this issue from the\nperspective of computational social science. In this paper, based on the\nanalysis of millions of tweets in Weibo, surprisingly, we find that anger\ntravels easily along weaker ties than joy, meaning that it can infiltrate\ndifferent communities and break free of local traps because strangers share\nsuch content more often. Through a simple diffusion model, we reveal that\nweaker ties speed up anger by applying both propagation velocity and coverage\nmetrics. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that quantitative\nlong-term evidence has been presented that reveals a difference in the\nmechanism by which joy and anger are disseminated. With the extensive\nproliferation of weak ties in booming social media, our results imply that the\ncontagion of anger could be profoundly strengthened to globalize its negative\nimpact.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 May 2020 02:57:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-06"}

Although unsupervised image-to-image translation\nnetworks represented by CycleGAN show great potential in dealing with domain\ngap, it is non-trivial to generalize this method to stereo matching due to the\nproblem of pixel distortion and stereo mismatch after translation. In this\npaper, we propose an end-to-end training framework with domain translation and\nstereo matching networks to tackle this challenge. First, joint optimization\nbetween domain translation and stereo matching networks in our end-to-end\nframework makes the former facilitate the latter one to the maximum extent.\nSecond, this framework introduces two novel losses, i.e., bidirectional\nmulti-scale feature re-projection loss and correlation consistency loss, to\nhelp translate all synthetic stereo images into realistic ones as well as\nmaintain epipolar constraints. The effective combination of above two\ncontributions leads to impressive stereo-consistent translation and disparity\nestimation accuracy. In addition, a mode seeking regularization term is added\nto endow the synthetic-to-real translation results with higher fine-grained\ndiversity.

In light of the hardness\nresult of Kapralov, Post, and Vondr\\'ak (SODA 2013) that restricts beating a\n$1/2$ competitive ratio for the more general problem of monotone submodular\nwelfare maximization, our result can be seen as strong evidence that\nedge-weighted bipartite matching is strictly easier than submodular welfare\nmaximization in the online setting.\n  The main ingredient in our online matching algorithm is a novel subroutine\ncalled online correlated selection (OCS), which takes a sequence of pairs of\nvertices as input and selects one vertex from each pair. Instead of using a\nfresh random bit to choose a vertex from each pair, the OCS negatively\ncorrelates decisions across different pairs and provides a quantitative measure\non the level of correlation.

The lack of\nadequate labeled images for small fields, huge variations in their color,\ntexture, and shape, and faint boundary lines separating them make it difficult\nto develop an end-to-end learning model for detecting such fields. Hence, in\nthis paper, we present a multi-stage approach that uses a combination of\nmachine learning and image processing techniques. In the first stage, we\nleverage state-of-the-art edge detection algorithms such as holistically-nested\nedge detection (HED) to extract first-level contours and polygons.

Since a few small, non-cropped but vegetated or constructed pockets\ncan be interspersed in areas that are predominantly croplands, in the final\nstage, we train a classifier for identifying each parcel from the previous\nstage as an agricultural field or not.

The goal is to design a\nmechanism to solve the routing problem for multiple autonomous vehicles and\nmultiple customers in order to maximize the transportation company's profit. As\na result, each vehicle selects the customer whose request maximizes the\ncompany's profit in the long run. To solve this problem, the system is modeled\nas a Markov Decision Process (MDP) using past customers data. By solving the\ndefined MDP, a centralized high-level planning recommendation is obtained,\nwhere this offline solution is used as an initial value for the real-time\nlearning. Then, a distributed SARSA reinforcement learning algorithm is\nproposed to capture the model errors and the environment changes, such as\nvariations in customer distributions in each area, traffic, and fares, thereby\nproviding optimal routing policies in real-time. Vehicles, or agents, use only\ntheir local information and interaction, such as current passenger requests and\nestimates of neighbors' tasks and their optimal actions, to obtain the optimal\npolicies in a distributed fashion. An optimal adaptive rate is introduced to\nmake the distributed SARSA algorithm capable of adapting to changes in the\nenvironment and tracking the time-varying optimal policies. Furthermore, a\ngame-theory-based task assignment algorithm is proposed, where each agent uses\nthe optimal policies and their values from distributed SARSA to select its\ncustomer from the set of local available requests in a distributed manner.\nFinally, the customers data provided by the city of Chicago is used to validate\nthe proposed algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 May 2020 07:28:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-06"}

Here, we\ninvestigate its role in nonlinear transport and diffusion within a paradigmatic\nmodel of tilted washboard potential. In this model, a giant enhancement of\ndriven diffusion over its potential-free limit presents a well-established\nparadoxical phenomenon. In the overdamped limit, it occurs at a critical tilt\nof vanishing potential barriers. However, for weak damping, it takes place\nsurprisingly at another critical tilt, where the potential barriers are clearly\nexpressed. Recently we showed that Basset force could make such a diffusion\nenhancement enormously large. In this paper, we discover that even for\nmoderately strong damping, where the overdamped theory works very well when the\nmemory effects are negligible, substantial hydrodynamic memory unexpectedly\nmakes a strong impact. First, the diffusion boost occurs at non-vanishing\npotential barriers and can be orders of magnitude larger. Second, transient\nanomalous diffusion regimes emerge over many time decades and potential\nperiods. Third, particles' mobility can also be dramatically enhanced, and a\nlong transient super-transport regime emerges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 May 2020 07:52:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Jul 2020 06:55:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-22"}

To\nsolve this challenge, many approaches were proposed to regularize the learning\nmodels. They add some hyper-parameters to the model to extend the\ngeneralization; however, it is a hard task to determine these hyper-parameters\nand a bad setting diverges the training process. In addition, most of the\nregularization schemes decrease the learning speed. Recently, Tai et al. [1]\nproposed low-rank tensor decomposition as a constrained filter for removing the\nredundancy in the convolution kernels of CNN. With a different viewpoint, we\nuse Low-Rank matrix Factorization (LRF) to drop out some parameters of the\nlearning model along the training process. However, this scheme similar to [1]\nprobably decreases the training accuracy when it tries to decrease the number\nof operations. Instead, we use this regularization scheme adaptively when the\ncomplexity of a layer is high. The complexity of any layer can be evaluated by\nthe nonlinear condition numbers of its learning system. The resulted method\nentitled \"AdaptiveLRF\" neither decreases the training speed nor vanishes the\naccuracy of the layer. The behavior of AdaptiveLRF is visualized on a noisy\ndataset. Then, the improvements are presented on some small-size and\nlarge-scale datasets. The preference of AdaptiveLRF on famous dropout\nregularizers on shallow networks is demonstrated. Also, AdaptiveLRF competes\nwith dropout and adaptive dropout on the various deep networks including\nMobileNet V2, ResNet V2, DenseNet, and Xception. The best results of\nAdaptiveLRF on SVHN and CIFAR-10 datasets are 98%, 94.1% F-measure, and 97.9%,\n94% accuracy.

We used a well-trained and high performing neural network\ndeveloped by REasoning for COmplex Data (RECOD) Lab for classification of three\nskin tumours, i.e. Melanocytic Naevi, Melanoma and Seborrheic Keratosis and\nperformed a detailed analysis on its latent space.

We show that bold assumptions\nabout the effect of interacting species on MSY are made when managing on a\nsingle-species basis, often leading to inconsistent and conflicting advice,\ndemonstrating the requirement of a multispecies MSY (MMSY). Although there are\nseveral definitions of MMSY, there is no consensus.

A possible way to\nextend well-established electronic-structure methods to this situation is to\nembed the Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian in a higher-dimensional light-matter hybrid\nauxiliary configuration space. In this work we show the importance of the\nresulting hybrid Fermi-Bose statistics of the polaritons, which are the new\nfundamental particles of the ``photon-dressed'' Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian for\nsystems in cavities. We show that violations of these statistics can lead to\nunphysical results. We present an efficient way to ensure the proper symmetry\nof the underlying wave functions by enforcing representability conditions on\nthe dressed one-body reduced density matrix. We further present a general\nprescription how to extend a given first-principles approach to polaritons and\nas an example introduce polaritonic Hartree-Fock theory. While being a\nsingle-reference method in polariton space, polaritonic Hartree-Fock is a\nmulti-reference method in the electronic space, i.e. it describes electronic\ncorrelations. We also discuss possible applications to polaritonic QEDFT. We\napply this theory to a lattice model and find that the more delocalized the\nbound-state wave function of the particles is, the stronger it reacts to\nphotons. The main reason is that within a small energy range many states with\ndifferent electronic configurations are available as opposed to a strongly\nbound (and hence energetically separated) ground-state wave function. This\nindicates that under certain conditions coupling to the quantum vacuum of a\ncavity can indeed modify ground state properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 May 2020 09:01:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-09-16"}

While the evidence for\ncosmic acceleration is robust to this possible systematic, the question remains\nof how much the latter can affect the inferred properties of the DE component\nresponsible for cosmic acceleration. This is the question we address in this\nwork. We use SNeIa distance moduli measurements from the Pantheon and JLA\nsamples. We consider models where the DE equation of state is a free parameter,\neither constant or time-varying, as well as models where DE and dark matter\ninteract, and finally a model-agnostic parametrization of effects due to\nmodified gravity (MG). When SNeIa data are combined with Cosmic Microwave\nBackground (CMB) temperature and polarization anisotropy measurements, we find\nstrong degeneracies between parameters governing the SNeIa systematics, the DE\nparameters, and the Hubble constant $H_0$. These degeneracies significantly\nbroaden the DE parameter uncertainties, in some cases leading to ${\\cal\nO}(\\sigma)$ shifts in the central values. However, including low-redshift\nBaryon Acoustic Oscillation and Cosmic Chronometer measurements, as well as CMB\nlensing measurements, considerably improves the previous constraints, and the\nonly remaining effect of the examined systematic is a $\\lesssim 40\\%$\nbroadening of the uncertainties on the DE parameters.

Ionospheric parameters, typically, virtual\nionospheric heights (VIHs), are required to perform coordinate registration for\nOTHR multitarget tracking and localization. The inaccuracy of ionospheric\nparameters has a significant deleterious effect on the target localization of\nOTHR. Therefore, to improve the localization accuracy of OTHR, it is important\nto develop accurate models and estimation methods of ionospheric parameters and\nthe corresponding target tracking algorithms. In this paper, we consider the\nvariation of the ionosphere with location and the spatial correlation of the\nionosphere in OTHR target tracking. We use a Gaussian Markov random field\n(GMRF) to model the VIHs, providing a more accurate representation of the VIHs\nfor OTHR target tracking. Based on expectation-conditional maximization and\nGMRF modeling of the VIHs, we propose a novel joint optimization solution,\ncalled ECM-GMRF, to perform target state estimation, multipath data association\nand VIHs estimation simultaneously. In ECM-GMRF, the measurements from both\nionosondes and OTHR are exploited to estimate the VIHs, leading to a better\nestimation of the VIHs which improves the accuracy of data association and\ntarget state estimation, and vice versa.

A multi-component approach is developed at finite\ntemperature using a compressible liquid drop description of the ions with an\nimproved energy functional based on recent microscopic nuclear models and\noptimized on extended Thomas-Fermi calculations.

An elegant way of achieving carbon-based magnetic\nmoments is the design of graphene nanostructures with an imbalanced occupation\nof the two sublattices forming the carbon honeycomb lattice.

Exact positioning of sublattice imbalanced\nnanostructures in graphene nanomaterials hence offers a route to control\ninteractions between induced local magnetic moments and to obtain graphene\nnanomaterials with magnetically non-trivial ground states. Here, we show that\nsuch sublattice imbalanced nanostructures can be incorporated along a large\nband gap armchair graphene nanoribbon on the basis of asymmetric zigzag edge\nextensions, which is achieved by incorporating specifically designed precursor\nmonomers during the bottom-up fabrication of the graphene nanoribbons.

Advanced visualizations for image\ncollections exist, but they need tight integration with a machine model to\nsupport analytic categorization. Directly employing computer vision and\ninteractive learning techniques gravitates towards search. Analytic\ncategorization, however, is not machine classification (the difference between\nthe two is called the pragmatic gap): a human adds/redefines/deletes categories\nof relevance on the fly to build insight, whereas the machine classifier is\nrigid and non-adaptive. Analytic categorization that brings the user to insight\nrequires a flexible machine model that allows dynamic sliding on the\nexploration-search axis, as well as semantic interactions. II-20 brings 3 major\ncontributions to multimedia analytics on image collections and towards closing\nthe pragmatic gap. Firstly, a machine model that closely follows the user's\ninteractions and dynamically models her categories of relevance. II-20's model,\nin addition to matching and exceeding the state of the art w. r. t. relevance,\nallows the user to dynamically slide on the exploration-search axis without\nadditional input from her side. Secondly, the dynamic, 1-image-at-a-time Tetris\nmetaphor that synergizes with the model. It allows the model to analyze the\ncollection by itself with minimal interaction from the user and complements the\nclassic grid metaphor. Thirdly, the fast-forward interaction, allowing the user\nto harness the model to quickly expand (\"fast-forward\") the categories of\nrelevance, expands the multimedia analytics semantic interaction dictionary.\nAutomated experiments show that II-20's model outperforms the state of the art\nand also demonstrate Tetris's analytic quality.

In the context of machine learning (ML),\nthe right to be forgotten requires an ML model owner to remove the data owner's\ndata from the training set used to build the ML model, a process known as\nmachine unlearning. While originally designed to protect the privacy of the\ndata owner, we argue that machine unlearning may leave some imprint of the data\nin the ML model and thus create unintended privacy risks. In this paper, we\nperform the first study on investigating the unintended information leakage\ncaused by machine unlearning. We propose a novel membership inference attack\nthat leverages the different outputs of an ML model's two versions to infer\nwhether a target sample is part of the training set of the original model but\nout of the training set of the corresponding unlearned model. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that the proposed membership inference attack achieves strong\nperformance. More importantly, we show that our attack in multiple cases\noutperforms the classical membership inference attack on the original ML model,\nwhich indicates that machine unlearning can have counterproductive effects on\nprivacy. We notice that the privacy degradation is especially significant for\nwell-generalized ML models where classical membership inference does not\nperform well. We further investigate four mechanisms to mitigate the newly\ndiscovered privacy risks and show that releasing the predicted label only,\ntemperature scaling, and differential privacy are effective. We believe that\nour results can help improve privacy protection in practical implementations of\nmachine unlearning.

The\ntypical training strategy is to adjust their input-output behavior so that it\nmatches that of the biological circuit of interest. Even though this strategy\nensures that the biological and artificial networks perform the same\ncomputational task, it does not guarantee that their internal activity dynamics\nmatch. This suggests that the trained RNNs might end up performing the task\nemploying a different internal computational mechanism, which would make them a\nsuboptimal model of the biological circuit. In this work, we introduce a novel\ntraining strategy that allows learning not only the input-output behavior of an\nRNN but also its internal network dynamics, based on sparse neural recordings.\nWe test the proposed method by training an RNN to simultaneously reproduce\ninternal dynamics and output signals of a physiologically-inspired neural\nmodel. Specifically, this model generates the multiphasic muscle-like activity\npatterns typically observed during the execution of reaching movements, based\non the oscillatory activation patterns concurrently observed in the motor\ncortex. Remarkably, we show that the reproduction of the internal dynamics is\nsuccessful even when the training algorithm relies on the activities of a small\nsubset of neurons sampled from the biological network. Furthermore, we show\nthat training the RNNs with this method significantly improves their\ngeneralization performance. Overall, our results suggest that the proposed\nmethod is suitable for building powerful functional RNN models, which\nautomatically capture important computational properties of the biological\ncircuit of interest from sparse neural recordings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 May 2020 14:16:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-09"}

In this paper, we tackle conversational\npassage retrieval (ConvPR), an important component of conversational search, by\naddressing query ambiguities with query reformulation integrated into a\nmulti-stage ad-hoc IR system. Specifically, we propose two conversational query\nreformulation (CQR) methods: (1) term importance estimation and (2) neural\nquery rewriting.

However, the lattice regularization breaks\nsupersymmetry explicitly, and in general a fine tuning of a large number of\nparameters is required to correctly extrapolate the theory to the continuum\nlimit. From this perspective, it is important to preserve on the lattice as\nmany symmetries of the original continuum action as possible. Chiral symmetry\nfor instance prevents an additive renormalization of the fermion mass. A\n(modified) version of chiral symmetry can be preserved exactly if the Dirac\noperator fulfills the Ginsparg-Wilson relation. In this contribution, we\npresent an exploratory non-perturbative study of N=1 supersymmetric Yang-Mills\ntheory using the overlap formalism to preserve chiral symmetry at non-zero\nlattice spacings. N=1 SYM is an ideal benchmark toward the extension of our\nstudies to more complex supersymmetric theories, as the only parameter to be\ntuned is the gluino mass.

The residual\nions hence act as an effective background to the propagating electromagnetic\nlaser field.

The variance inflation factor (VIF) is traditionally\napplied to diagnose the possible existence of multicollinearity, but it is not\nalways the case that detection by VIF of a troubling degree of\nmulticollinearity corresponds to negative effects on the statistical analysis.\nThe reason for the lack of specificity of VIF is that there are other factors,\nsuch as the size of the sample and the variance of the random disturbance, that\ncan lead to high values of the VIF but not to problematic variance in the OLS\nestimators (see O'Brien 2007).

While the size dependence of this effect makes it weak in bulk\nsystems in comparison to piezoelectricity, it suggests that it plays a bigger\nrole in nanoscale systems such as thin films and nanotubes (NTs). In this paper\nwe demonstrate using first-principles calculations that the walls of carbon\nnanotubes (CNTs) and transition metal dichalcogenide nanotubes (TMD NTs) are\npolarized in the radial direction, the strength of the polarization increasing\nas the size of the NT decreases. For CNTs and TMD NTs with chiral indices\n$(n,m)$, the radial polarization of the walls $P_R$ starts to diverge below $\nC(n,m)/a = \\sqrt{n^2 +nm + m^2} \\sim 10$, where $C(n,m)$ is the circumference\nof the NT and $a$ is the lattice constant of the 2D monolayer. For CNTs, $P_R$\ndrops to zero above this value but for TMD NTs there is a non-zero polarization\nabove this value, which is an ionic rather than electronic effect. The size\ndependence of $P_R$ in the TMD NTs is interesting: it increases gradually and\nreaches a maximum of $P_R \\sim 100 \\ \\text{C/cm}^2$ at $C(n,m)/a \\sim 15$, then\ndecreases until $C(n,m)/a \\sim 10$ where it starts to diverge.

These results suggest that while the walls of smaller\nCNTs and TMD NTs are polarized, the walls of larger TMD NTs are also polarized\ndue to a difference in strain on the inner and outer atoms in the walls.

In this approach, an ILP system (the learner) decomposes the\nlearning problem into three separate stages: generate, test, and constrain. In\nthe generate stage, the learner generates a hypothesis (a logic program) that\nsatisfies a set of hypothesis constraints (constraints on the syntactic form of\nhypotheses). In the test stage, the learner tests the hypothesis against\ntraining examples. A hypothesis fails when it does not entail all the positive\nexamples or entails a negative example. If a hypothesis fails, then, in the\nconstrain stage, the learner learns constraints from the failed hypothesis to\nprune the hypothesis space, i.e. to constrain subsequent hypothesis generation.\nFor instance, if a hypothesis is too general (entails a negative example), the\nconstraints prune generalisations of the hypothesis. If a hypothesis is too\nspecific (does not entail all the positive examples), the constraints prune\nspecialisations of the hypothesis. This loop repeats until either (i) the\nlearner finds a hypothesis that entails all the positive and none of the\nnegative examples, or (ii) there are no more hypotheses to test. We introduce\nPopper, an ILP system that implements this approach by combining answer set\nprogramming and Prolog. Popper supports infinite problem domains, reasoning\nabout lists and numbers, learning textually minimal programs, and learning\nrecursive programs.

A\npromising tool for accelerating parametrizations is the use of machine learning\ntechniques. In this study, we develop a machine learning-based parametrization\nfor the gaseous optical properties by training neural networks to emulate a\nmodern radiation parameterization (RRTMGP). To minimize computational costs, we\nreduce the range of atmospheric conditions for which the neural networks are\napplicable and use machine-specific optimised BLAS functions to accelerate\nmatrix computations. To generate training data, we use a set of randomly\nperturbed atmospheric profiles and calculate optical properties using RRTMGP.\nPredicted optical properties are highly accurate and the resulting radiative\nfluxes have average errors within \\SI{0.5}{\\flux} compared to RRTMGP. Our\nneural network-based gas optics parametrization is up to 4 times faster than\nRRTMGP, depending on the size of the neural networks. We further test the\ntrade-off between speed and accuracy by training neural networks for the narrow\nrange of atmospheric conditions of a single large-eddy simulation, so smaller\nand therefore faster networks can achieve a desired accuracy. We conclude that\nour machine learning-based parametrization can speed-up radiative transfer\ncomputations whilst retaining high accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 May 2020 15:00:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 May 2020 14:06:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 16 Aug 2020 08:59:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-17"}

Using fractal\ndimension, we can describe urban growth and form and characterize spatial\ncomplexity. A number of fractal models and measurements have been proposed for\nurban studies. However, the precondition for fractal dimension application is\nto find scaling relations in cities. In absence of scaling property, we can\nmake use of entropy function and measurements. This paper is devoted to\nresearching how to describe urban growth by using spatial entropy. By analogy\nwith fractal dimension growth models of cities, a pair of entropy increase\nmodels can be derived and a set of entropy-based measurements can be\nconstructed to describe urban growing process and patterns. First, logistic\nfunction and Boltzmann equation are utilized to model the entropy increase\ncurves of urban growth. Second, a series of indexes based on spatial entropy\nare used to characterize urban form. Further, multifractal dimension spectrums\nare generalized to spatial entropy spectrums. Conclusions are drawn as follows.\nEntropy and fractal dimension have both intersection and different spheres of\napplication to urban research. Thus, for a given spatial measurement scale,\nfractal dimension can often be replaced by spatial entropy for simplicity. The\nmodels and measurements presented in this work are significant for integrating\nentropy and fractal dimension into the same framework of urban spatial analysis\nand understanding spatial complexity of cities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 May 2020 15:07:40 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 Aug 2020 13:17:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 15:24:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-17"}

This process includes, as a special case, the standard nearest\nneighbor lattice random walk. We derive explicitly the generating function of\nthe distribution $P(R_n)$ of the number of records, valid for arbitrary\ndiscrete jump distributions. As a byproduct, we provide a relatively simple\nproof of the generalized Sparre Andersen theorem for the survival probability\nof a random walk on a line, with discrete or continuous jump distributions.

Instead, in the inhomogeneous phases (close\nto equilibrium and within the MIPS sector) the particles can be separated in\ntwo groups with different diffusion properties and effective temperatures.\nNotably, at fixed activity strength the effective temperatures in the two\nphases remain distinct and approximately constant within the MIPS region, with\nvalues corresponding to the ones of the whole system at the boundaries of this\nsector of the phase diagram. We complement the study of the globally averaged\nproperties with the theoretical and numerical characterization of the\nfluctuation distributions of the single particle diffusion, linear response,\nand effective temperature in the homogeneous and inhomogeneous phases. We also\ndistinguish the behavior of the (time-delayed) effective temperature from the\n(instantaneous) kinetic temperature, showing that the former is independent on\nthe friction coefficient.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 May 2020 15:57:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-07-29"}

Optimal charging and discharge management of\nelectric vehicles can fill the gap between self-generation and building\nelectric demand while accounting for electricity tariffs. Optimal interactions\nbetween EVs and buildings will play a key role in the operation of power\nnetworks with a high penetration of distributed energy resources, such as the\nPortuguese electric grid.

Solving directly\nthis type of optimization problem is often computationally unfeasible. Recent\nstudies suggest that one can instead turn this problem into one of solving a\ndynamical system of equations, which can instead be solved efficiently using\nnumerical methods. This results in enabling the acquisition of optimal network\ntopologies from a variety of routing problems. However, the actual extraction\nof the solution in terms of a final network topology relies on numerical\ndetails which can prevent an accurate investigation of their topological\nproperties. In this context, theoretical results are fully accessible only to\nan expert audience and ready-to-use implementations for non-experts are rarely\navailable or insufficiently documented. In particular, in this framework, final\ngraph acquisition is a challenging problem in-and-of-itself. Here we introduce\na method to extract networks topologies from dynamical equations related to\nrouting optimization under various parameters' settings. Our method is made of\nthree steps: first, it extracts an optimal trajectory by solving a dynamical\nsystem, then it pre-extracts a network and finally, it filters out potential\nredundancies. Remarkably, we propose a principled model to address the\nfiltering in the last step, and give a quantitative interpretation in terms of\na transport-related cost function. This principled filtering can be applied to\nmore general problems such as network extraction from images, thus going beyond\nthe scenarios envisioned in the first step. Overall, this novel algorithm\nallows practitioners to easily extract optimal network topologies by combining\nbasic tools from numerical methods, optimization and network theory. Thus, we\nprovide an alternative to manual graph extraction which allows a grounded\nextraction from a large variety of optimal topologies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 May 2020 16:07:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-11"}

To solve the inverse\nproblem in compliance with the upcoming need for improved accuracy, a\ncomputationally expensive forward model has to be defined which maps geometry\nparameters to diffracted light intensities.\n  Aim:\n  To quantify the uncertainties in the reconstruction of the geometry\nparameters, a fast to evaluate surrogate for the forward model has to be\nintroduced.\n  Approach:\n  We use a non-intrusive polynomial chaos based approximation of the forward\nmodel which increases speed and thus enables the exploration of the posterior\nthrough direct Bayesian inference. Additionally, this surrogate allows for a\nglobal sensitivity analysis at no additional computational overhead.\n  Results:\n  This approach yields information about the complete distribution of the\ngeometry parameters of a silicon line grating, which in return allows to\nquantify the reconstruction uncertainties in the form of means, variances and\nhigher order moments of the parameters.\n  Conclusion:\n  The use of a polynomial chaos surrogate allows to quantify both parameter\ninfluences and reconstruction uncertainties. This approach is easy to use since\nno adaptation of the expensive forward model is required.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 May 2020 07:56:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-12"}

The\nobjective was to identify essential requirements for the establishment and\noperation of data trusts. Preliminary findings were presented during the\nmeeting then refined as participants and co-authors identified relevant\nliterature and contributed to this manuscript.\n  Results: Twelve (12) minimum specification requirements (min specs) for data\ntrusts were identified. The foundational min spec is that data trusts must meet\nall legal requirements, including legal authority to collect, hold or share\ndata. In addition, there was agreement that data trusts must have (i) an\naccountable governing body which ensures the data trust advances its stated\npurpose and is transparent, (ii) comprehensive data management including\nresponsible parties and clear processes for the collection, storage, access,\ndisclosure and use of data, (iii) training and accountability requirements for\nall data users and (iv) ongoing public and stakeholder engagement.\n  Conclusion / Implications: Based on a review of the literature and advice\nfrom participants from 15 Canadian organizations/initiatives, practical\nguidance in the form of twelve min specs for data trusts were agreed on.

We propose a representation model accounting for three states,\ni.e., two fluids and a solid wall between the two fluids, by using a single\ndesign variable field. The key aspect of the proposed model is that mixing of\nthe two fluids can be essentially prevented without any penalty scheme. This is\nbecause the solid constantly exists between the two fluids due to the use of\nthe single design variable field. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed approach through three-dimensional numerical examples in which an\noptimized design is compared with a simple reference design, and the effects of\ndesign conditions (i.e., Reynolds number, Prandtl number, design domain size,\nand flow arrangements) are investigated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 5 May 2020 04:53:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-05-19"}

Analyzing shopping\ntransactions demands techniques that can cope with the volume and\ndimensionality of grocery transactional data while keeping interpretable\noutcomes. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) provides a suitable framework to\nprocess grocery transactions and to discover a broad representation of\ncustomers' shopping motivations. However, summarizing the posterior\ndistribution of an LDA model is challenging, while individual LDA draws may not\nbe coherent and cannot capture topic uncertainty. Moreover, the evaluation of\nLDA models is dominated by model-fit measures which may not adequately capture\nthe qualitative aspects such as interpretability and stability of topics.\n  In this paper, we introduce clustering methodology that post-processes\nposterior LDA draws to summarise the entire posterior distribution and identify\nsemantic modes represented as recurrent topics. Our approach is an alternative\nto standard label-switching techniques and provides a single posterior summary\nset of topics, as well as associated measures of uncertainty. Furthermore, we\nestablish a more holistic definition for model evaluation, which assesses topic\nmodels based not only on their likelihood but also on their coherence,\ndistinctiveness and stability. By means of a survey, we set thresholds for the\ninterpretation of topic coherence and topic similarity in the domain of grocery\nretail data. We demonstrate that the selection of recurrent topics through our\nclustering methodology not only improves model likelihood but also outperforms\nthe qualitative aspects of LDA such as interpretability and stability.

This model highlights the importance of the localization of the\ntransition between a convective and a diffusive transport of respiratory gas.\nThis localization determines how ventilation should be controlled in order to\nminimize its energetic cost at any metabolic regime. We generalized this model\nto any mammal, based on the core morphometric characteristics shared by all\nmammalian lungs and on their allometric scaling from the literature. Since the\nmain energetic costs of ventilation are related to convective transport, we\nprove that, for all mammals, the localization of the shift from a convective\ntransport to a diffusive transport plays a critical role on keeping this cost\nlow while fulfilling the lung function. Our model predicts for the first time\nthe localization of this transition in order to minimize the energetic cost of\nventilation, depending on mammal mass and metabolic regime. From this optimal\nlocalization, we are able to predict allometric scaling laws for both tidal\nvolumes and breathing rates, at any metabolic rate. We ran our model for the\nthree common metabolic rates -- basal, field and maximal -- and showed that our\npredictions reproduce accurately experimental data available in the literature.\nOur analysis supports the hypothesis that mammals allometric scaling laws of\ntidal volumes and breathing rates at a given metabolic rate are driven by a few\ncore geometrical characteristics shared by mammalian lungs and by the physical\nprocesses of respiratory gas transport.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 4 May 2020 22:17:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 27 May 2020 12:16:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 26 Aug 2020 07:26:56 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 4 Mar 2021 14:50:48 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 29 Jun 2021 09:41:15 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Fri, 3 Sep 2021 08:58:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-06"}
