Several challenges can\narise in making an automatic short answer scoring system, one of which is the\nquantity and quality of the data. The data labeling process is not easy because\nit requires a human annotator who is an expert in their field. Further, the\ndata imbalance process is also a challenge because the number of labels for\ncorrect answers is always much less than the wrong answers. In this paper, we\npropose the use of a stacking model based on neural network and XGBoost for\nclassification process with sentence embedding feature. We also propose to use\ndata upsampling method to handle imbalance classes and hyperparameters\noptimization algorithm to find a robust model automatically.

For this, a systematic backstepping\napproach is provided and it is shown that cooperative output regulation with\nexponential convergence is ensured for the resulting multi-agent system. The\nresults of the paper are applied to the cooperative output regulation of a\nheterogeneous network of four parabolic agents in the presence of local\ndisturbances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 2020 16:25:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-22"}

Can pharmacological therapies be suggested to improve\nlearning and memory in these disorders? To address this question, we simulated\ndrug effects within a computational model describing induction of late\nlong-term potentiation (L-LTP). Biochemical pathways impaired in these and\nother disorders converge on a common target, histone acetylation by\nacetyltransferases such as CREB binding protein (CBP), which facilitates gene\ninduction necessary for L-LTP. We focused on four drug classes: tropomyosin\nreceptor kinase B (TrkB) agonists, cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitors, histone\ndeacetylase inhibitors, and ampakines. Simulations suggested each drug type\nalone may rescue deficits in L-LTP. A potential disadvantage, however, was the\nnecessity of simulating strong drug effects (high doses), which could produce\nadverse side effects. Thus, we investigated the effects of six drug pairs among\nthe four classes described above. These combination treatments normalized\nimpaired L-LTP with substantially smaller drug doses. In addition three of\nthese combinations, a TrkB agonist paired with an ampakine and a cAMP\nphosphodiesterase inhibitor paired with a TrkB agonist or an ampakine,\nexhibited strong synergism in L-LTP rescue. Therefore, we suggest these drug\ncombinations are promising candidates for further empirical studies in animal\nmodels of genetic disorders that impair acetylation, L-LTP, and learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 2020 16:33:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-22"}

Extremely fast charging (XFC), whereby electric\nvehicles (EV) can be quickly recharged in the time frame it takes to refuel an\ninternal combustion engine, has been proposed to alleviate this concern. A\ncritical component of these chargers is the efficient and proper operation of\npower converters that convert AC to DC power and otherwise regulate power\ndelivery to vehicles.

Furthermore, in the first attack of its\nkind, it is shown that the gate signal that controls the converter switches can\nbe manipulated, to catastrophic effect; i.e., it is possible for an attacker to\ncontrol the switching state of individual transistors to cause irreparable\ndamage to the converter and associated systems.

To preserve the network topology, the\nproposed approach relies on local information about the network's structure,\nwhich is collected and disseminated at runtime. The paper studies two\nstrategies for distributing topological data: one based on Mobile Agents (our\nproposal) and the other based on Trickle (a reference gossiping protocol from\nthe literature). These two strategies were adapted for our self-healing\napproach to collect topological information for recovering the network; and\nwere evaluated in terms of resource overheads.

At the same time, Mobile Agents\ncollect less information, focusing on local dissemination, which suffices for\nnetwork recovery. This entails less bandwidth overheads than when Trickle is\nused. Still, Mobile Agents utilise more memory and exchange more messages,\nduring data-collection, than Trickle does.

Conventional methods apply a weight-sharing network, e.g., any\nkind of graph neural networks, across all neighborhoods to directly generate\npoint signatures and gain the generalization ability by extensive training over\na large amount of training samples from scratch. However, these methods lack\nthe flexibility in rapidly adapting to unseen neighborhood structures and thus\ngeneralizes poorly on new point sets. In this paper, we propose a novel\nmeta-learning based 3D point signature model, named 3Dmetapointsignature (MEPS)\nnetwork, that is capable of learning robust point signatures in 3D shapes. By\nregarding each point signature learning process as a task, our method obtains\nan optimized model over the best performance on the distribution of all tasks,\ngenerating reliable signatures for new tasks, i.e., signatures of unseen point\nneighborhoods. Specifically, the MEPS consists of two modules: a base signature\nlearner and a meta signature learner. During training, the base-learner is\ntrained to perform specific signature learning tasks. In the meantime, the\nmeta-learner is trained to update the base-learner with optimal parameters.\nDuring testing, the meta-learner that is learned with the distribution of all\ntasks can adaptively change parameters of the base-learner, accommodating to\nunseen local neighborhoods. We evaluate the MEPS model on two datasets, e.g.,\nFAUST and TOSCA, for dense 3Dshape correspondence. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our method not only gains significant improvements over the\nbaseline model and achieves state-of-the-art results, but also is capable of\nhandling unseen 3D shapes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 2020 17:27:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-22"}

In\nparticular, they may have any spin and need not be particles or even\nquasiparticles. The standard coset construction used to formulate effective\nactions of Goldstones, however, is rather restrictive and is incapable of\ngenerating the full spectrum of possibilities allowed by Goldstone's theorem.\nWe propose a (partial) remedy to this problem by postulating a novel coset\nconstruction for systems that spontaneously break Poincar\\'e symmetry. This new\nconstruction is capable of generating effective actions with a wide range of\nGoldstone excitations---including fermionic degrees of freedom---even when all\nsymmetries are bosonic. To demonstrate it's utility, we focus on constructing\neffective actions for point particles of various spins. We recover the known\nresult that a particle of spin $s$ requires an $\\mathcal N=2s$ supersymmetric\nworldline reparameterization gauge symmetry, which we implement at the level of\nthe coset construction. In the process, we discover that massless particles\nrequire a novel kind of inverse Higgs constraint that bears some resemblance to\nthe dynamical inverse Higgs constraints that appear in certain fermi liquid\neffective field theories. We then consider particles that, in addition to\nquantum spin, have finite spatial extent and are free to rotate. We derive a\nnovel action for such particles and find a `spin-orbital' coupling between the\nintrinsic quantum spin and the physical-rotation degrees of freedom.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 2020 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-26"}

Stable modes are shown to transport momentum up its\ngradient, shrinking the layer width whenever they exceed unstable modes in\namplitude.

Aims: We seek to identify the processes by\nwhich these hot flux ropes form, with a view of developing our understanding of\nCMEs and thereby improving space weather forecasts. Methods:\nExtreme-ultraviolet observations were used to identify five pre-eruptive hot\nflux ropes in the solar corona and study how they evolved. Confined flares were\nobserved in the hours and days before each flux rope erupted, and these were\nused as indicators of episodic bursts of magnetic reconnection by which each\nflux rope formed. The evolution of the photospheric magnetic field was observed\nduring each formation period to identify the process(es) that enabled magnetic\nreconnection to occur in the $\\beta<1$ corona and form the flux ropes. Results:\nThe confined flares were found to be homologous events and suggest flux rope\nformation times that range from 18 hours to 5 days. Throughout these periods,\nfragments of photospheric magnetic flux were observed to orbit around each\nother in sunspots where the flux ropes had a footpoint. Active regions with\nright-handed (left-handed) twisted magnetic flux exhibited clockwise\n(anticlockwise) orbiting motions, and right-handed (left-handed) flux ropes\nformed. Conclusions: We infer that the orbital motions of photospheric magnetic\nflux fragments about each other bring magnetic flux tubes together in the\ncorona, enabling component reconnection that forms a magnetic flux rope above a\nflaring arcade. This represents a novel trigger mechanism for solar eruptions\nand should be considered when predicting solar magnetic activity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 2020 18:00:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 11 Dec 2020 14:45:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-04"}

We present the first runs of the STARFORGE project, using a new\nnumerical framework to follow the formation of individual stars in giant\nmolecular clouds (GMCs) using the GIZMO code. Our suite include runs with\nincreasingly complex physics, starting with isothermal ideal\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) and then adding non-isothermal thermodynamics and\nprotostellar outflows. We show that without protostellar outflows the resulting\nstellar masses are an order of magnitude too high, similar to the result in the\nbase isothermal MHD run. Outflows disrupt the accretion flow around the\nprotostar, allowing gas to fragment and additional stars to form, thereby\nlowering the mean stellar mass to a value similar to that observed. The effect\nof jets upon global cloud evolution is most pronounced for lower-mass GMCs and\ndense clumps, so while jets can disrupt low-mass clouds, they are unable to\nregulate star formation in massive GMCs, as they would turn an order unity\nfraction of the mass into stars before unbinding the cloud. Jets are also\nunable to stop the runaway accretion of massive stars, which could ultimately\nlead to the formation of stars with masses $\\mathrm{>500\\,M_\\odot}$. Although\nwe find that the mass scale set by jets is insensitive to most cloud parameters\n(i.e., surface density, virial parameter), it is strongly dependent on the\nmomentum loading of the jets (which is poorly constrained by observations) as\nwell the the temperature of the parent cloud, which predicts slightly larger\nIMF variations than observed.

However, so-called TinyML presents severe technical challenges, as deep\nneural network inference demands a large compute and memory budget. To address\nthis challenge, neural architecture search (NAS) promises to help design\naccurate ML models that meet the tight MCU memory, latency and energy\nconstraints. A key component of NAS algorithms is their latency/energy model,\ni.e., the mapping from a given neural network architecture to its inference\nlatency/energy on an MCU. In this paper, we observe an intriguing property of\nNAS search spaces for MCU model design: on average, model latency varies\nlinearly with model operation (op) count under a uniform prior over models in\nthe search space. Exploiting this insight, we employ differentiable NAS (DNAS)\nto search for models with low memory usage and low op count, where op count is\ntreated as a viable proxy to latency.

In the\napplication of learning lane-change behavior for autonomous driving, agents\nhave to deal with a varying number of surrounding vehicles. Furthermore, the\nnumber of required transitions imposes a bottleneck, since test drivers cannot\nperform an arbitrary amount of lane changes in the real world. In the\noff-policy setting, additional information on solving the task can be gained by\nobserving actions from others. While in the classical RL setup this knowledge\nremains unused, we use other drivers as surrogates to learn the agent's value\nfunction more efficiently. We propose Surrogate Q-learning that deals with the\naforementioned problems and reduces the required driving time drastically. We\nfurther propose an efficient implementation based on a permutation-equivariant\ndeep neural network architecture of the Q-function to estimate action-values\nfor a variable number of vehicles in sensor range.

These obstacles\nhave become a serious problem in some fields, such as high-quality music mixing\nand speech processing. In this paper, a novel approach using a temporal\nconvolutional attention network (TCAN) is proposed to tackle this problem. The\nuse of temporal conventional network (TCN) can capture long range patterns\nusing a hierarchy of temporal convolutional filters. To enhance the ability to\ntackle audio anomalies in different acoustic conditions, an attention mechanism\nis used in TCN, where a self-attention block is added after each temporal\nconvolutional layer. This aims to highlight the target related features and\nmitigate the interferences from irrelevant information. To evaluate the\nperformance of the proposed model, audio recordings are collected from the\nTIMIT dataset, and are then changed by adding five different types of audio\ndistortions: gaussian noise, magnitude drift, random dropout, reduction of\ntemporal resolution, and time warping. Distortions are mixed at different\nsignal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) (5dB, 10dB, 15dB, 20dB, 25dB, 30dB).

In this\npaper, we extend this gas dynamical model to also include non-trivial disk\nheights, which may also resolve the mass discrepancy independent of\nsub-Keplerian velocity components. By combining the existing velocity\nmeasurements and the EHT mass estimate, we place constraints on the gas disk\ninclination and sub-Kelplerian fraction. These constraints require the\nparsec-scale ionized gas disk be misaligned with the milli-arcsecond radio jet\nby at least $11^{\\circ}$, and more typically $27^{\\circ}$. Modifications to the\ngas dynamics model either by introducing sub-Keplerian velocities or thick\ndisks produces further misalignment with the radio jet. If the jet is produced\nin a Blandford-Znajek-type process, the angular momentum of the black hole is\ndecoupled with the angular momentum of the large scale gas feeding M87*.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 2020 20:39:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Feb 2021 16:58:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-24"}

However, a key question is whether strong gradients\nor discontinuities can adversely affect this pattern to the point of hindering\nits identification. Other important questions are how rotational splittings are\naffected by the 2D rotation profiles expected from baroclinic effects and\nwhether it is possible to probe the rotation profile using these splittings.\nAccordingly, we numerically calculate pulsation modes in continuous and\ndiscontinuous rapidly rotating models produced by the 2D ESTER (Evolution\nSTEllaire en Rotation) code. This spectral multi-domain code self-consistently\ncalculates the rotation profile based on baroclinic effects and allows us to\nintroduce discontinuities without loss of numerical accuracy. Pulsations are\ncalculated using an adiabatic version of the Two-dimensional Oscillation\nProgram (TOP) code. The variational principle is used to confirm the high\naccuracy of the pulsation frequencies and to derive an integral formula that\nclosely matches the generalised rotational splittings, except when modes are\ninvolved in avoided crossings. This potentially allows us to probe the the\nrotation profile using inverse theory. Acoustic glitch theory, applied along\nthe island mode orbit deduced from ray dynamics, can correctly predict the\nperiodicity of the glitch frequency pattern produced by a discontinuity or the\nGamma1 dip related to the He II ionisation zone in some of the models. The\nasymptotic frequency pattern remains sufficiently well preserved to potentially\nallow its detection in observed stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 2020 21:17:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-06"}

The majority of traditional planners are inefficient as they\nuse uninformative sampling distributions as opposed to exploiting structures\nand patterns in the problem to guide better sampling strategies. Moreover, most\ncurrent learning-based planners are susceptible to posterior collapse or mode\ncollapse due to the sparsity and highly varying nature of C-Space and motion\nplan configurations. In this work, we introduce a conditional normalising flow\nbased distribution learned through previous experiences to improve sampling of\nthese methods. Our distribution can be conditioned on the current problem\ninstance to provide an informative prior for sampling configurations within\npromising regions. When we train our sampler with an expert planner, the\nresulting distribution is often near-optimal, and the planner can find a\nsolution faster, with less invalid samples, and less initial cost. The\nnormalising flow based distribution uses simple invertible transformations that\nare very computationally efficient, and our optimisation formulation explicitly\navoids mode collapse in contrast to other existing learning-based planners.\nFinally, we provide a formulation and theoretical foundation to efficiently\nsample from the distribution; and demonstrate experimentally that, by using our\nnormalising flow based distribution, a solution can be found faster, with less\nsamples and better overall runtime performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 2020 21:46:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-23"}

For many tasks such as repeated infrastructure inspection, item\ndelivery, or inventory transport, a route repeating capability can be\nsufficient and offers potential practical advantages over a full navigation\nstack. Previous teach and repeat research has achieved high performance in\ndifficult conditions predominantly by using sophisticated, expensive sensors,\nand has often had high computational requirements. Biological systems, such as\nsmall animals and insects like seeing ants, offer a proof of concept that\nrobust and generalisable navigation can be achieved with extremely limited\nvisual systems and computing power. In this work we create a novel asynchronous\nformulation for teach and repeat navigation that fully utilises odometry\ninformation, paired with a correction signal driven by much more\ncomputationally lightweight visual processing than is typically required. This\ncorrection signal is also decoupled from the robot's motor control, allowing\nits rate to be modulated by the available computing capacity. We evaluate this\napproach with extensive experimentation on two different robotic platforms, the\nConsequential Robotics Miro and the Clearpath Jackal robots, across navigation\ntrials totalling more than 6000 metres in a range of challenging indoor and\noutdoor environments.

Although most empirical studies have been\ndominated by two theoretical models including discrete categories of emotion\nand dichotomous dimensions, results from neuroscience approaches suggest a\nmulti-processes mechanism underpinning emotional experience with a large\noverlap across different emotions. While these findings are consistent with the\ninfluential theories of emotion in psychology that emphasize a role for\nmultiple component processes to generate emotion episodes, few studies have\nsystematically investigated the relationship between discrete emotions and a\nfull componential view. This paper applies a componential framework with a\ndata-driven approach to characterize emotional experiences evoked during movie\nwatching. The results suggest that differences between various emotions can be\ncaptured by a few (at least 6) latent dimensions, each defined by features\nassociated with component processes, including appraisal, expression,\nphysiology, motivation, and feeling. In addition, the link between discrete\nemotions and component model is explored and results show that a componential\nmodel with a limited number of descriptors is still able to predict the level\nof experienced discrete emotion(s) to a satisfactory level. Finally, as\nappraisals may vary according to individual dispositions and biases, we also\nstudy the relationship between personality traits and emotions in our\ncomputational framework and show that the role of personality on discrete\nemotion differences can be better justified using the component model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Oct 2020 01:27:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-23"}

Recently,\nSigned Distance Functions (SDFs) and Occupany Functions are adopted in\nlearning-based shape reconstruction methods as implicit 3D shape\nrepresentation. This paper proposes a novel method for learning occupancy\nfunctions from sparse point clouds and achieves better performance on\nchallenging surface reconstruction tasks. Unlike the previous methods, which\npredict point occupancy with fully-connected multi-layer networks, we adapt the\npoint cloud deep learning architecture, Point Convolution Neural Network\n(PCNN), to build our learning model. Specifically, we create a sampling\noperator and insert it into PCNN to continuously sample the feature space at\nthe points where occupancy states need to be predicted. This method natively\nobtains point cloud data's geometric nature, and it's invariant to point\npermutation. Our occupancy function learning can be easily fit into procedures\nof point cloud up-sampling and surface reconstruction. Our experiments show\nstate-of-the-art performance for reconstructing With ShapeNet dataset and\ndemonstrate this method's well-generalization by testing it with McGill 3D\ndataset \\cite{siddiqi2008retrieving}.

Existing methods solve this problem by assuming\nthe items within the same basket are correlated by one semantic relation, thus\noptimizing the item embeddings. However, this assumption breaks when there\nexist multiple intents within a basket. For example, assuming a basket contains\n\\{\\textit{bread, cereal, yogurt, soap, detergent}\\} where \\{\\textit{bread,\ncereal, yogurt}\\} are correlated through the \"breakfast\" intent, while\n\\{\\textit{soap, detergent}\\} are of \"cleaning\" intent, ignoring multiple\nrelations among the items spoils the ability of the model to learn the\nembeddings. To resolve this issue, it is required to discover the intents\nwithin the basket. However, retrieving a multi-intent pattern is rather\nchallenging, as intents are latent within the basket. Additionally, intents\nwithin the basket may also be correlated. Moreover, discovering a multi-intent\npattern requires modeling high-order interactions, as the intents across\ndifferent baskets are also correlated. To this end, we propose a new framework\nnamed as \\textbf{M}ulti-\\textbf{I}ntent \\textbf{T}ranslation \\textbf{G}raph\n\\textbf{N}eural \\textbf{N}etwork~({\\textbf{MITGNN}}). MITGNN models $T$ intents\nas tail entities translated from one corresponding basket embedding via $T$\nrelation vectors. The relation vectors are learned through multi-head\naggregators to handle user and item information. Additionally, MITGNN\npropagates multiple intents across our defined basket graph to learn the\nembeddings of users and items by aggregating neighbors. Extensive experiments\non two real-world datasets prove the effectiveness of our proposed model on\nboth transductive and inductive BR.

This problem is challenging, because KGs can be massive and\nincomplete. Recent approaches embed KG entities in a low dimensional space and\nthen use these embeddings to find the answer entities. However, it has been an\noutstanding challenge of how to handle arbitrary first-order logic (FOL)\nqueries as present methods are limited to only a subset of FOL operators. In\nparticular, the negation operator is not supported. An additional limitation of\npresent methods is also that they cannot naturally model uncertainty.

BetaE is the first method that can handle a complete set of\nfirst-order logical operations: conjunction ($\\wedge$), disjunction ($\\vee$),\nand negation ($\\neg$). A key insight of BetaE is to use probabilistic\ndistributions with bounded support, specifically the Beta distribution, and\nembed queries/entities as distributions, which as a consequence allows us to\nalso faithfully model uncertainty. Logical operations are performed in the\nembedding space by neural operators over the probabilistic embeddings. We\ndemonstrate the performance of BetaE on answering arbitrary FOL queries on\nthree large, incomplete KGs. While being more general, BetaE also increases\nrelative performance by up to 25.4% over the current state-of-the-art KG\nreasoning methods that can only handle conjunctive queries without negation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Oct 2020 06:11:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-23"}

In this work, we tightly characterize optimal rates for both\nproblems and uncover the phase transition phenomenon from a global testing\nproblem to a local estimation problem. Introducing a suitable definition of the\nenergy of a change-point, we first establish in the single change-point setting\nthat the optimal detection threshold is $\\sqrt{2\\log\\log(n)}$. When the energy\nis just above the detection threshold, then the problem of localizing the\nchange-point becomes purely parametric: it only depends on the difference in\nmeans and not on the position of the change-point anymore. Interestingly, for\nmost change-point positions, it is possible to detect and localize them at a\nmuch smaller energy level. In the multiple change-point setting, we establish\nthe energy detection threshold and show similarly that the optimal localization\nerror of a specific change-point becomes purely parametric. Along the way,\ntight optimal rates for Hausdorff and $l_1$ estimation losses of the vector of\nall change-points positions are also established. Two procedures achieving\nthese optimal rates are introduced. The first one is a least-squares estimator\nwith a new multiscale penalty that favours well spread change-points. The\nsecond one is a two-step multiscale post-processing procedure whose\ncomputational complexity can be as low as $O(n\\log(n))$. Notably, these two\nprocedures accommodate with the presence of possibly many low-energy and\ntherefore undetectable change-points and are still able to detect and localize\nhigh-energy change-points even with the presence of those nuisance parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Oct 2020 06:26:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 15 Nov 2020 23:57:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-17"}

The metric of productivity\nused here is the annual number of refereed papers within which are presented\nresults that are based at least in part on observations made with the\ntelescopes of LO on Mount Hamilton.

A bibliography of papers pertinent to observations\nfrom Lick Observatory has been compiled, and is made available through a NASA\nADS library.\n  The overall productivity of the observatory, counting all telescopes, went\nthrough a broad maximum between the years 1975 and 1982.

An author\nnetwork shows that this period is attended by the introduction of digital\ndetector systems at LO, particularly at the Shane telescope. Following 1983 the\noverall productivity of LO shows a net long-term decrease but with two other\nlesser peaks superimposed on that decrease. A slightly smaller peak occurs\naround 1996 and is associated with programs taking advantage of CCD\nspectrometers at both cassegrain and coud\\'{e} foci of the Shane telescope. A\nthird lesser peak around 2012 can be attributed to a rise in extragalactic\nsupernova studies originating out of UC Berkeley.

Our key contribution\nis the realisation that the regularised Eikonal equation can be simply solved\nby applying the logarithmic transformation to a GPIS formulation to recover the\naccurate Euclidean distance field (EDF) and, at the same time, the implicit\nsurface. To derive the proposed representation, Varadhan's formula is exploited\nto approximate the non-linear Eikonal partial differential equation (PDE) of\nthe EDF by the logarithm of a linear PDE. We show that members of the Matern\ncovariance family directly satisfy this linear PDE. The proposed approach does\nnot require post-processing steps to recover the EDF. Moreover, unlike\nsampling-based methods, Log-GPIS does not use sample points inside and outside\nthe surface as the derivative of the covariance allow direct estimation of the\nsurface normals and distance gradients. We benchmarked the proposed method on\nsimulated and real data against state-of-the-art mapping frameworks that also\naim at recovering both the surface and a distance field.

A recent study of this reaction by\nRichardson and coworkers has found a large difference between their new\npath-integral method, GR-QTST, and the saddle point approximation of Wolynes\n(Wolynes theory). They suggested that this difference could be attributed to\nthe existence of multiple tunnelling pathways, leading Wolynes theory to\nsignificantly overestimate the rate. This was used to argue that the linear\nresponse assumptions of Marcus theory may break down for liquid systems when\ntunnelling is important. If true, this would imply that the commonly used\nmethod for studying such systems, where the problem is mapped onto a spin-boson\nmodel, is invalid. However, we have recently shown that size inconsistency in\nGR-QTST can lead to poor predictions of the rate in systems with many degrees\nof freedom. We have also suggested an improved method, the path-integral linear\ngolden-rule (LGR) approximation, which fixes this problem. Here we demonstrate\nthat the GR-QTST results for ferrous-ferric electron transfer are indeed\ndominated by its size consistency error. Furthermore, by comparing the LGR and\nWolynes theory results, we confirm the established picture of nuclear\ntunnelling in this system.

Instead of solely relying on 3D proposals, firstly, our method\nleverages the Siamese network applied on RGB images to produce 2D region\nproposals which are then extruded into 3D viewing frustums. Besides, we perform\nan online accuracy validation on the 3D frustum to generate refined point cloud\nsearching space, which can be embedded directly into the existing 3D tracking\nbackbone.

In addition, benefited from introducing\nthe online accuracy validation, for occasional cases with strong occlusions or\nvery sparse points, our approach can still achieve high precision, even when\nthe 2D Siamese tracker loses the target.

We call this approach Language-Model-Free IPL (slimIPL) and\ngive a resultant training setup for low-resource settings with CTC-based\nmodels. slimIPL features a dynamic cache for pseudo-labels which reduces\nsensitivity to changes in relabeling hyperparameters and results in improves\ntraining stability. slimIPL is also highly-efficient and requires 3.5-4x fewer\ncomputational resources to converge than other state-of-the-art\nsemi/self-supervised approaches. With only 10 hours of labeled audio, slimIPL\nis competitive with self-supervised approaches, and is state-of-the-art with\n100 hours of labeled audio without the use of a language model both at test\ntime and during pseudo-label generation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Oct 2020 08:36:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Apr 2021 20:42:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 17 Apr 2021 05:08:56 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 16 Jul 2021 08:11:52 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 30 Aug 2021 02:29:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-31"}

A systematic solution is\npresented for additive time-varying actuator, process and sensor faults in the\npresence of disturbances. The faults and disturbances are represented by the\nsolutions of finite-dimensional signal models, which allow to take a large\nclass of signals into account. For disturbances, that are only bounded, a\nthreshold for secured fault diagnosis is derived. By applying integral\ntransformations to the system an algebraic fault detection equation to detect\nfaults in finite time is obtained. The corresponding integral kernels result\nfrom the realization of a finite-time transition between a non-equilibrium\ninitial state and a vanishing final state of a hyperbolic ODE-PDE system. For\nthis new challenging problem, a systematic trajectory planning approach is\npresented. In particular, this problem is facilitated by mapping the kernel\nequations into backstepping coordinates and tracing the solution of the\ntransition problem back to a simple trajectory planning.

To this end, we propose a single, end-to-end trainable\nconvolutional autoencoder. We show that a single model can be used to create\nnatural transitions between different types of activities. Furthermore, our\nmethod is not only able to fill in entire missing frames, but it can also be\nused to complete gaps where partial poses are available (e.g. from end\neffectors), or to clean up other forms of noise (e.g. Gaussian).

We\nfirst construct a graph using segment-wise speaker embeddings and then input\nthese to graph attention networks. After a few graph attention layers with\nresidual connections, each node is projected into a one-dimensional space using\naffine transform, followed by a readout operation resulting in a scalar\nsimilarity score. To enable successful adaptation for speaker verification, we\npropose techniques such as separating trainable weights for attention map\ncalculations between segment-wise speaker embeddings from different utterances.\nThe effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated using three different\nspeaker embedding extractors trained with different architectures and objective\nfunctions.

The area of natural language processing considers AI-complete\ntasks that cannot be solved using traditional algorithmic actions.

The accuracy of this task has implications for the\neffectiveness of many other tasks in the area of natural language processing.\nIn spite of the active development of research in the area of natural language\nprocessing, the investigation of the search for noun phrases within Ukrainian\ntexts are still at an early stage. Results. The different methods of noun\nphrases detection have been analyzed. The expediency of the representation of\nsentences as a tree structure has been justified. The key disadvantage of many\nmethods of noun phrase detection is the severe dependence of the effectiveness\nof their detection from the features of a certain language. Taking into account\nthe unified format of sentence processing and the availability of the trained\nmodel for the building of sentence trees for Ukrainian texts, the Universal\nDependency model has been chosen.

However, the lack of joint learning of regional features and global\nfeatures will cause the regional features to lose contact with the global\ncontext, leading to the mismatch with those non-object words which have global\nmeanings in some sentences. In this work, in order to alleviate this issue, it\nis necessary to enhance the relations between regions and the relations between\nregional and global concepts to obtain a more accurate visual representation so\nas to be better correlated to the corresponding text. Thus, a novel multi-level\nsemantic relations enhancement approach named Dual Semantic Relations Attention\nNetwork(DSRAN) is proposed which mainly consists of two modules, separate\nsemantic relations module and the joint semantic relations module. DSRAN\nperforms graph attention in both modules respectively for region-level\nrelations enhancement and regional-global relations enhancement at the same\ntime. With these two modules, different hierarchies of semantic relations are\nlearned simultaneously, thus promoting the image-text matching process by\nproviding more information for the final visual representation. Quantitative\nexperimental results have been performed on MS-COCO and Flickr30K and our\nmethod outperforms previous approaches by a large margin due to the\neffectiveness of the dual semantic relations learning scheme.

Therefore,\nwe apply an efficient semismooth Newton method to subproblems of the proximal\nDCA. Numerical experiments on various synthetic and real data sets demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of the non-convex penalty MCP in promoting sparsity. Compared\nwith the state-of-the-art method \\cite[Algorithm~1]{ying2020does}, our method\nis demonstrated to be more efficient and reliable for learning graph Laplacian\nwith MCP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Oct 2020 09:33:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-23"}

Our experiments show that LoMeX can\nextract long k-mers from current Illumina reads with a higher recall than a\nstandard k-mer counting tool. Furthermore, our experiments on simulated data\nshow that when the read length further increases, the performance of standard\nk-mer counters declines, whereas LoMeX still extracts long k-mers successfully.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Oct 2020 10:47:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Oct 2020 12:45:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-01"}

The fitted HDNNP describes the potential-energy surface of\nthe QM particles with an electrostatic embedding scheme. Thus, the MM particles\nfeel a force from the polarized QM particles. To achieve chemical accuracy, we\nfind that even simple systems require models with a strong gradient\nregularization, a large number of data points, and a substantial number of\nparameters. To address this issue, we extend our approach to a delta-learning\nscheme, where the ML model learns the difference between a reference method\n(DFT) and a cheaper semi-empirical method (DFTB). We show that such a scheme\nreaches the accuracy of the DFT reference method, while requiring significantly\nless parameters. Furthermore, the delta-learning scheme is capable of correctly\nincorporating long-range interactions within a cutoff of 1.4 nm. It is\nvalidated by performing MD simulations of retinoic acid in water and the\ninteraction between S-adenoslymethioniat with cytosine in water. The presented\nresults indicate that delta-learning is a promising approach for (QM)ML/MM MD\nsimulations of condensed-phase systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Oct 2020 11:14:15 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2021 20:10:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-15"}

The position of the radio core is\ntypically estimated by fitting a Gaussian template to the interferometric\nvisibilities.

However, the two\nmethods are highly complementary because data-driven methods are more\npredictive but less interpretable and robust, while theory-driven methods are\nmore interpretable and robust but less predictive. Using their complementary\nnature, this study designs a theory-based residual neural network (TB-ResNet)\nframework, which synergizes discrete choice models (DCMs) and deep neural\nnetworks (DNNs) based on their shared utility interpretation. The TB-ResNet\nframework is simple, as it uses a ($\\delta$, 1-$\\delta$) weighting to take\nadvantage of DCMs' simplicity and DNNs' richness, and to prevent underfitting\nfrom the DCMs and overfitting from the DNNs. This framework is also flexible:\nthree instances of TB-ResNets are designed based on multinomial logit model\n(MNL-ResNets), prospect theory (PT-ResNets), and hyperbolic discounting\n(HD-ResNets), which are tested on three data sets. Compared to pure DCMs, the\nTB-ResNets provide greater prediction accuracy and reveal a richer set of\nbehavioral mechanisms owing to the utility function augmented by the DNN\ncomponent in the TB-ResNets. Compared to pure DNNs, the TB-ResNets can modestly\nimprove prediction and significantly improve interpretation and robustness,\nbecause the DCM component in the TB-ResNets stabilizes the utility functions\nand input gradients. Overall, this study demonstrates that it is both feasible\nand desirable to synergize DCMs and DNNs by combining their utility\nspecifications under a TB-ResNet framework. Although some limitations remain,\nthis TB-ResNet framework is an important first step to create mutual benefits\nbetween DCMs and DNNs for travel behavior modeling, with joint improvement in\nprediction, interpretation, and robustness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Oct 2020 12:31:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-23"}

This variant of the\nQROM allows for a more fine-grained query-complexity analysis.\n  Our main technical contribution is a framework that simplifies the use of\n(the parallel-query generalization of) the compressed oracle technique for\nproving query complexity results. With our framework in place, whenever\napplicable, it is possible to prove quantum query complexity lower bounds by\nmeans of purely classical reasoning. More than that, for typical examples the\ncrucial classical observations that give rise to the classical bounds are\nsufficient to conclude the corresponding quantum bounds.\n  We demonstrate this on a few examples, recovering known results (like the\noptimality of parallel Grover), but also obtaining new results (like the\noptimality of parallel BHT collision search). Our main target is the hardness\nof finding a $q$-chain with fewer than $q$ parallel queries, i.e., a sequence\n$x_0, x_1,\\ldots, x_q$ with $x_i = H(x_{i-1})$ for all $1 \\leq i \\leq q$.\n  The above problem of finding a hash chain is of fundamental importance in the\ncontext of proofs of sequential work.

The queue is driven by an\nexternal arrival process and is subject to a time-varying service process that\nis a function of the SINR that it sees. Static configurations of interferers\nresult in an infinite queue workload with positive probability. In contrast, a\ngeneric stability condition is established for the queue in the case where\ninterferers possess any non-zero mobility that results in displacements that\nare both independent across interferers and oblivious to interferer positions.\nThe proof leverages the mixing property of the Poisson point process. The\neffect of an increase in mobility on queueing metrics is also studied. Convex\nordering tools are used to establish that faster moving interferers result in a\nqueue workload that is smaller for the increasing-convex stochastic order. As a\ncorollary, mean workload and mean delay decrease as network mobility increases.\nThis stochastic ordering as a function of mobility is explained by establishing\npositive correlations between SINR level-crossing events at different time\npoints, and by determining the autocorrelation function for interference and\nobserving that it decreases with increasing mobility. System behaviour is\nempirically analyzed using discrete-event simulation and the performance of\nvarious mobility models is evaluated using heavy-traffic approximations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Oct 2020 14:13:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Apr 2021 16:16:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-14"}

The Feynman-alpha method is predicated on\ntime-correlated neutron detections that deviate from a Poisson random variable\ndue to multiplication.

Although there has been a great deal of work\non attacking models for colored and grayscale images, little is known about\nattacks on models for binary images. Models trained to classify binary images\nare used in text recognition applications such as check processing, license\nplate recognition, invoice processing, and many others. In contrast to colored\nand grayscale images, the search space of attacks on binary images is extremely\nrestricted and noise cannot be hidden with minor perturbations in each pixel.\nThus, the optimization landscape of attacks on binary images introduces new\nfundamental challenges.\n  In this paper we introduce a new attack algorithm called SCAR, designed to\nfool classifiers of binary images. We show that SCAR significantly outperforms\nexisting $L_0$ attacks applied to the binary setting and use it to demonstrate\nthe vulnerability of real-world text recognition systems. SCAR's strong\nperformance in practice contrasts with the existence of classifiers that are\nprovably robust to large perturbations. In many cases, altering a single pixel\nis sufficient to trick Tesseract, a popular open-source text recognition\nsystem, to misclassify a word as a different word in the English dictionary. We\nalso license software from providers of check processing systems to most of the\nmajor US banks and demonstrate the vulnerability of check recognitions for\nmobile deposits. These systems are substantially harder to fool since they\nclassify both the handwritten amounts in digits and letters, independently.\nNevertheless, we generalize SCAR to design attacks that fool state-of-the-art\ncheck processing systems using unnoticeable perturbations that lead to\nmisclassification of deposit amounts. Consequently, this is a powerful method\nto perform financial fraud.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Oct 2020 14:57:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-24"}

Final version accepted for publication in Mathematische\n  Zeitschrift","journal-ref":null,"doi":null,"report-no":null,"categories":"math.RT","license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/","abstract":"  If $k$ is a field, $A$ a finite dimensional $k$-algebra, then the simple\n$A$-modules form a simple minded collection in the derived category\n$\\operatorname{D}^b( \\operatorname{mod} A )$. Their extension closure is\n$\\operatorname{mod} A$; in particular, it is abelian. This situation is\nemulated by a general simple minded collection $\\mathcal{S}$ in a suitable\ntriangulated category $\\mathcal{C}$. In particular, the extension closure\n$\\langle \\mathcal{S} \\rangle$ is abelian, and there is a tilting theory for\nsuch abelian subcategories of $\\mathcal{C}$. These statements follow from\n$\\langle \\mathcal{S} \\rangle$ being the heart of a bounded $t$-structure.\n  It is a defining characteristic of simple minded collections that their\nnegative self extensions vanish in every degree. Relaxing this to vanishing in\ndegrees $\\{ -w+1, \\ldots, -1 \\}$ where $w$ is a positive integer leads to the\nrich, parallel notion of $w$-simple minded systems, which have recently been\nthe subject of vigorous interest.\n  If $\\mathcal{S}$ is a $w$-simple minded system for some $w \\geqslant 2$, then\n$\\langle \\mathcal{S} \\rangle$ is typically not the heart of a $t$-structure.\nNevertheless, using different methods, we will prove that $\\langle \\mathcal{S}\n\\rangle$ is abelian and that there is a tilting theory for such abelian\nsubcategories. Our theory is based on Quillen's notion of exact categories, in\nparticular a theorem by Dyer which provides exact subcategories of triangulated\ncategories.\n  The theory of simple minded systems can be viewed as \"negative cluster\ntilting theory\". In particular, the result that $\\langle \\mathcal{S} \\rangle$\nis an abelian subcategory is a negative counterpart to the result from (higher)\npositive cluster tilting theory that if $\\mathcal{T}$ is a cluster tilting\nsubcategory, then $( \\mathcal{T} * \\Sigma \\mathcal{T} )/[ \\mathcal{T} ]$ is an\nabelian quotient category.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Oct 2020 15:24:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 2020 14:10:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 1 Nov 2021 10:02:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-02"}

Our method\nruns in real-time and is free of user interactions. We decompose this artistic\ncreation process into a couple of proxy tasks including sky matting, motion\nestimation, and image blending. Experiments are conducted on videos diversely\ncaptured in the wild by handheld smartphones and dash cameras, and show high\nfidelity and good generalization of our method in both visual quality and\nlighting/motion dynamics.

Order-of-magnitude differences begin to occur for $e>0.6$. Critically,\nhigher-order eccentricity terms activate additional spin-orbit resonances.\nWorlds experiencing non-synchronous rotation can fall into and out of these\nresonances, altering their long-term evolution. Non-zero obliquity generally\ndoes not generate significantly higher heating; however, it can considerably\nalter orbital and rotational evolution. Much like eccentricity, obliquity can\nactivate new tidal modes and resonances. Tracking the dual-body dissipation\nwithin Pluto and Charon leads to faster evolution and dramatically different\norbital outcomes. Based on our findings, we recommend future tidal studies on\nworlds with $e\\geq0.3$ to take into account additional eccentricity terms\nbeyond $e^{2}$. This threshold should be lowered to $e>0.1$ if non-synchronous\nrotation or non-zero obliquity is under consideration. Due to the poor\nconvergence of the eccentricity functions, studies on worlds that may\nexperience very high eccentricity ($e\\geq0.6$) should include terms with high\npowers of eccentricity. We provide these equations up to $e^{10}$ for arbitrary\nobliquity and non-synchronous rotation. Finally, the assumption that\nshort-period, solid-body exoplanets with $e\\gtrsim0.1$ are tidally locked in\ntheir 1:1 spin-orbit resonance should be reconsidered. Higher-order spin-orbit\nresonances can exist even at these relatively modest eccentricities, while\nprevious studies have found such resonances can significantly alter\nstellar-driven climate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Oct 2020 15:29:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 22 Jan 2021 17:05:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-25"}

This required us to developed a\nFactorized Neural Process, which embeds the observed set into a latent space\npartitioned into the receptive field location and the tuning function\nproperties.

Mathematical models have been established as an important tool for\ncapturing the features that drive the spread of the disease, predicting the\nprogression of an epidemic and hence guiding the development of strategies to\ncontrol it. Another important area of epidemiological interest is the\ndevelopment of geostatistical methods for the analysis of data from spatially\nreferenced prevalence surveys. Maps of prevalence are useful, not only for\nenabling a more precise disease risk stratification, but also for guiding the\nplanning of more reliable spatial control programmes by identifying affected\nareas. Despite the methodological advances that have been made in each area\nindependently, efforts to link transmission models and geostatistical maps have\nbeen limited. Motivated by this fact, we developed a Bayesian approach that\ncombines fine-scale geostatistical maps of disease prevalence with transmission\nmodels to provide quantitative, spatially explicit projections of the current\nand future impact of control programs against a disease. These estimates can\nthen be used at a local level to identify the effectiveness of suggested\nintervention schemes and allow investigation of alternative strategies. The\nmethodology has been applied to lymphatic filariasis in East Africa to provide\nestimates of the impact of different intervention strategies against the\ndisease.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Oct 2020 12:46:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-26"}

In the domain of chess problem\ncomposition, the same is true. Traditional machine learning approaches tend to\nfocus on the ability of computers to process massive amounts of data and\ncontinuously adjust 'weights' within an artificial neural network to better\ndistinguish between say, two groups of objects. Contrasted with chess\ncompositions, there is no clear distinction between what constitutes one and\nwhat does not; even less so between a good one and a poor one. We propose a\ncomputational method that is able to learn from existing databases of 'liked'\nand 'disliked' compositions such that a new and unseen collection can be sorted\nwith increased probability of matching a solver's preferences. The method uses\na simple 'change factor' relating to the Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN) of each\ncomposition's starting position, coupled with repeated statistical analysis of\nsample pairs from both databases. Tested using the author's own collections of\ncomputer-generated chess problems, the experimental results showed that the\nmethod was able to sort a new and unseen collection of compositions such that,\non average, over 70% of the preferred compositions were in the top half of the\ncollection. This saves significant time and energy on the part of solvers as\nthey are likely to find more of what they like sooner.

While on one side, the\nsupporters of the efficient market hypothesis claim that it is impossible to\nforecast stock prices accurately, many researchers believe otherwise. There\nexist propositions in the literature that have demonstrated that if properly\ndesigned and optimized, predictive models can very accurately and reliably\npredict future values of stock prices. This paper presents a suite of deep\nlearning based models for stock price prediction. We use the historical records\nof the NIFTY 50 index listed in the National Stock Exchange of India, during\nthe period from December 29, 2008 to July 31, 2020, for training and testing\nthe models. Our proposition includes two regression models built on\nconvolutional neural networks and three long and short term memory network\nbased predictive models. To forecast the open values of the NIFTY 50 index\nrecords, we adopted a multi step prediction technique with walk forward\nvalidation. In this approach, the open values of the NIFTY 50 index are\npredicted on a time horizon of one week, and once a week is over, the actual\nindex values are included in the training set before the model is trained\nagain, and the forecasts for the next week are made. We present detailed\nresults on the forecasting accuracies for all our proposed models. The results\nshow that while all the models are very accurate in forecasting the NIFTY 50\nopen values, the univariate encoder decoder convolutional LSTM with the\nprevious two weeks data as the input is the most accurate model. On the other\nhand, a univariate CNN model with previous one week data as the input is found\nto be the fastest model in terms of its execution speed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Oct 2020 03:09:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-31"}

For example, it is known that\nembedded within any chaotic attractor are infinitely many unstable periodic\norbits (UPOs) and so a chaotic trajectory can be thought of as `jumping' from\none UPO to another in a seemingly unpredictable manner. A number of studies\nhave sought to exploit the existence of these UPOs to control a chaotic system.\nThese methods rely on introducing small, precise parameter manipulations each\ntime the trajectory crosses a transverse section to the flow. Typically these\nmethods suffer from the fact that they require a precise description of the\nPoincar\\'e mapping for the flow, which is a difficult task since there is no\nsystematic way of producing such a mapping associated to a given system. Here\nwe employ recent model discovery methods for producing accurate and\nparsimonious parameter-dependent Poincar\\'e mappings to stabilize UPOs in\nnonlinear dynamical systems. Specifically, we use the sparse identification of\nnonlinear dynamics (SINDy) method to frame model discovery as a sparse\nregression problem, which can be implemented in a computationally efficient\nmanner. This approach provides an explicit Poincar\\'e mapping that faithfully\ndescribes the dynamics of the flow in the Poincar\\'e section and can be used to\nidentify UPOs. For each UPO, we then determine the parameter manipulations that\nstabilize this orbit. The utility of these methods are demonstrated on a\nvariety of differential equations, including the R\\\"ossler system in a chaotic\nparameter regime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Oct 2020 00:16:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Mar 2021 22:01:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-18"}

Electron interaction cross sections for elastic scattering,\nionisation, and electronic excitation were calculated in the four DNA bases\nadenine, thymine, guanine and cytosine. The electron energy range is extended\nto include relativistic electrons. Elastic scattering cross sections were\ncalculated using the independent atom model with amplitude derived from ELSEPA\ncode. Relativistic Binary Encounter Bethe Vriens model was used to calculate\nionisation cross sections. The electronic excitation cross sections\ncalculations were based on the water cross sections following the same strategy\nused in CPA100 code. These were implemented within the Geant4-DNA option6\nphysics constructor to extend its capability of tracking electrons in DNA\nmaterial in addition to liquid water. Since DNA nucleobases have different\nmolecular structure than water it is important to perform more accurate\nsimulations especially because DNA is considered the most radiosensitive\nstructure in cells. Differential and integrated cross sections calculations\nwere in good agreement with data from the literature for all DNA bases.\nStopping power, range and inelastic mean free path calculations in the four DNA\nbases using this new extension of Geant4-DNA option6 are in good agreement with\ncalculations done by other studies, especially for high energy electrons. Some\ndeviations are shown at the low electron energy range, which could be\nattributed to the different interaction models. Comparison with water\nsimulations shows obvious difference which emphasizes the need to include DNA\nbases cross sections in track structure codes for better estimation of\nradiation effects on biological material.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 2020 17:39:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-24"}

However, a growing concern is that due to unequal\naccess to computing power, only certain firms and elite universities have\nadvantages in modern AI research. Using a novel dataset of 171394 papers from\n57 prestigious computer science conferences, we document that firms, in\nparticular, large technology firms and elite universities have increased\nparticipation in major AI conferences since deep learning's unanticipated rise\nin 2012. The effect is concentrated among elite universities, which are ranked\n1-50 in the QS World University Rankings. Further, we find two strategies\nthrough which firms increased their presence in AI research: first, they have\nincreased firm-only publications; and second, firms are collaborating primarily\nwith elite universities. Consequently, this increased presence of firms and\nelite universities in AI research has crowded out mid-tier (QS ranked 201-300)\nand lower-tier (QS ranked 301-500) universities. To provide causal evidence\nthat deep learning's unanticipated rise resulted in this divergence, we\nleverage the generalized synthetic control method, a data-driven counterfactual\nestimator. Using machine learning based text analysis methods, we provide\nadditional evidence that the divergence between these two groups - large firms\nand non-elite universities - is driven by access to computing power or compute,\nwhich we term as the \"compute divide\". This compute divide between large firms\nand non-elite universities increases concerns around bias and fairness within\nAI technology, and presents an obstacle towards \"democratizing\" AI. These\nresults suggest that a lack of access to specialized equipment such as compute\ncan de-democratize knowledge production.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Oct 2020 15:11:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-30"}
