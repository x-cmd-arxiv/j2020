Here we extend these scaling laws to {\\it dynamic}\nloops, where enthalpy flux becomes important to the energy balance, and study\nimpulsive heating/filling characterized by upward enthalpy flows. We show that\nfor collision-dominated thermal conduction, the functional dependencies of the\nscaling laws are the same as for the static case, when the radiative losses\nscale as $T^{-1/2}$, but with a different constant of proportionality that\ndepends on the Mach number $M$ of the flow. The dependence on the Mach number\nis such that the scaling laws for low to moderate Mach number flows are almost\nindistinguishable from the static case. When thermal conduction is limited by\nturbulent processes, however, the much weaker dependence of the scattering mean\nfree path (and hence thermal conduction coefficient) on temperature leads to a\nlimiting Mach number for return enthalpy fluxes driven by thermal conduction\nbetween the corona and chromosphere.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2020 16:01:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-09"}

Because these pulsars and their companion\nstars are in tight orbits with typical separations of $10^{11}$ cm, their winds\ninteract strongly forming an intrabinary shock. Electron-positron pairs\nreaccelerated at the shock can reach energies of about 10 TeV, which makes this\nnew population a potential source of GeV-TeV cosmic ray positrons. We present\nan analytical model for the fluxes and spectra of positrons from intrabinary\nshocks of CBMSPs. We find that the minimum energy $E_{\\min}$ of the pairs that\nenter the shock is critical to quantify the energy spectrum with which\npositrons are injected into the interstellar medium. We measure for the first\ntime the Galactic scale height of CBMSPs, $z_e=0.4\\pm0.1$ kpc, after correcting\nfor an observational bias against finding them close to the Galactic plane.\nFrom this, we estimate a local density of 5-9 kpc$^{-3}$ and an extrapolated\ntotal of 2-7 thousand CBMSPs in the Galaxy. We then propagate the pairs in the\nisotropic diffusion approximation and find that the positron flux from the\ntotal population is about two times higher than that from the 52 currently\nknown systems. For $E_{\\min}$ between 1 and 50 GeV, our model predicts only a\nminor contribution from CBMSPs to the diffuse positron flux at 100 GeV observed\nat Earth. We also quantify the effects of anisotropic transport due to the\nordered Galactic magnetic field, which can change the diffuse flux from nearby\nsources drastically. Finally, we find that a single \"hidden\" CBMSP close to the\nGalactic plane can yield a positron flux comparable to the AMS-02 measurements\nat 600 GeV if its line-of-sight to Earth is along the ordered Galactic field\nlines, while its combined electron and positron flux at higher energies would\nbe close to the measurements of CALET, DAMPE and Fermi-LAT.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2020 16:06:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2021 11:55:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-17"}

Since one can define\nmultiple tasks for a given environment dynamics, there are two important\nchallenges. First, we need to abstract the concept of safety that applies\nbroadly to that environment independent of the specific task being executed.\nSecond, we need a mechanism for the abstracted notion of safety to modulate the\nactions of agents executing different policies to minimize their side-effects.\nIn this work, we propose Safety Aware Reinforcement Learning (SARL) - a\nframework where a virtual safe agent modulates the actions of a main\nreward-based agent to minimize side effects. The safe agent learns a\ntask-independent notion of safety for a given environment. The main agent is\nthen trained with a regularization loss given by the distance between the\nnative action probabilities of the two agents. Since the safe agent effectively\nabstracts a task-independent notion of safety via its action probabilities, it\ncan be ported to modulate multiple policies solving different tasks within the\ngiven environment without further training.

A jet is a collimated spray of particles generated via\nsuccessive parton branchings, starting with a virtual quark or gluon produced\nby the collision. When such a jet is produced in the dense environment of a\nnucleus-nucleus collision, its interactions with the surrounding medium lead to\na modification of its properties, phenomenon known as jet quenching. In this\nthesis, we develop a new theory to describe jet quenching. We compute for the\nfirst time the effects of the medium on multiple vacuum-like emissions, that is\nemissions triggered by the virtuality of the initial parton. We present a new\nphysical picture for jet evolution, with notably a factorisation in time\nbetween vacuum-like emissions and medium-induced emissions. This picture is\nMarkovian, hence well suited for a Monte Carlo implementation that we develop\nin the parton shower JetMed. We then investigate the phenomenological\nconsequences of our new picture on jet observables and especially the jet\nnuclear modification factor $R_{AA}$, the Soft Drop $z_g$ distribution and the\njet fragmentation function.

When the true data generating process is based on physical\nprocesses these impose symmetries and constraints, and the generative model can\nbe created by learning an effective description of the underlying physics,\nwhich enables scaling of the generative model to very high dimensions. In this\nwork we propose Lagrangian Deep Learning (LDL) for this purpose, applying it to\nlearn outputs of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. The model uses layers\nof Lagrangian displacements of particles describing the observables to learn\nthe effective physical laws. The displacements are modeled as the gradient of\nan effective potential, which explicitly satisfies the translational and\nrotational invariance. The total number of learned parameters is only of order\n10, and they can be viewed as effective theory parameters. We combine N-body\nsolver FastPM with LDL and apply them to a wide range of cosmological outputs,\nfrom the dark matter to the stellar maps, gas density and temperature. The\ncomputational cost of LDL is nearly four orders of magnitude lower than the\nfull hydrodynamical simulations, yet it outperforms it at the same resolution.\nWe achieve this with only of order 10 layers from the initial conditions to the\nfinal output, in contrast to typical cosmological simulations with thousands of\ntime steps. This opens up the possibility of analyzing cosmological\nobservations entirely within this framework, without the need for large\ndark-matter simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2020 18:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-28"}

The\nEffective Field Theory of Large-Scale Structure (EFTofLSS) provides a\nconsistent way to predict the clustering of dark matter and baryons on large\nscales, where their leading corrections in perturbation theory are given by a\nsimple and calculable functional form even after the onset of baryonic\nprocesses. In this paper, we extend the two-fluid-like system up to two-loop\norder in perturbation theory. Along the way, we show that a new linear\ncounterterm proportional to the relative velocity of the fluids could\ngenerically be present, but we show that its effects are expected to be small\nin our universe.

We find that the EFTofLSS at two-loop\norder can accurately account for the details of baryonic processes on large\nscales.

Three particular 21st century public health\ncrises -- urban gun violence, rural wildfires and global viral spread --\npresent qualitatively and quantitatively varying uncertainty regimes that\nexhibit (a) different collective magnitudes of spatial coarsening, (b) uniform\nand mixed magnitude coarsening, (c) differently shaped uncertainty regions and\n-- less orthodox -- (d) locational data distributed within the `wrong'\neffective space. We explicitly model such uncertainties in a Bayesian manner\nand jointly infer unknown locations together with all parameters of a\nreasonably flexible Hawkes model, obtaining results that are practically and\nstatistically distinct from those obtained while ignoring spatial coarsening.\nThis work also features two different secondary contributions: first, to\nfacilitate Bayesian inference of locations and background rate parameters, we\nmake a subtle yet crucial change to an established kernel-based rate model; and\nsecond, to facilitate the same Bayesian inference at scale, we develop a\nmassively parallel implementation of the model's log-likelihood gradient with\nrespect to locations and thus avoid its quadratic computational cost in the\ncontext of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. Our examples involve thousands of\nobservations and allow us to demonstrate practicality at moderate scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2020 19:46:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Jul 2021 22:17:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-14"}

The output of this\nmodule is the sum of the outputs of the two layers. Based on the proposed GSA\nmodule, we introduce new standalone global attention-based deep networks that\nuse GSA modules instead of convolutions to model pixel interactions.

Motivated by large-scale\nInternet advertising and fair division applications, this paper considers a\ngeneralization of a linear Fisher market where there is a finite set of buyers\nand a continuum of items. We introduce generalizations of the Eisenberg-Gale\nconvex program and its dual to this infinite-dimensional setting, which leads\nto Banach-space optimization problems.

As a complement, this exploratory study aimed to examine drivers'\npsychophysiological responses to TORs as a result of varying\nnon-driving-related tasks (NDRTs), traffic density and TOR lead time. A total\nnumber of 102 drivers were recruited and each of them experienced 8 takeover\nevents in a high fidelity fixed-base driving simulator. Drivers' gaze\nbehaviors, heart rate (HR) activities, galvanic skin responses (GSRs), and\nfacial expressions were recorded and analyzed during two stages. First, during\nthe automated driving stage, we found that drivers had lower heart rate\nvariability, narrower horizontal gaze dispersion, and shorter eyes-on-road time\nwhen they had a high level of cognitive load relative to a low level of\ncognitive load. Second, during the takeover transition stage, 4s lead time led\nto inhibited blink numbers and larger maximum and mean GSR phasic activation\ncompared to 7s lead time, whilst heavy traffic density resulted in increased HR\nacceleration patterns than light traffic density. Our results showed that\npsychophysiological measures can indicate specific internal states of drivers,\nincluding their workload, emotions, attention, and situation awareness in a\ncontinuous, non-invasive and real-time manner.

To address the question of whether a population of\nsingle particle tracks, obtained from many different cells, corresponds to a\nsingle mode of diffusion, we derive theoretical equations describing the\nprobability distribution of the displacement covariance, assuming the\ndisplacement is a zero-mean multivariate Gaussian random variable. We also\ndetermine the corresponding theoretical means, variances, and third central\nmoments.

We also show that, for sufficiently long tracks, each\ncovariance distribution in these examples is well-described by a skew-normal\ndistribution with mean, variance, and skewness given by theory. For\nexperimental S. pombe gene locus data, however, we find that the first two\ncovariance distributions are wider than predicted, although the third and\nsubsequent covariances are well-described by theory.

The previous study by\nFlanagan and Racine [Phys. Rev. D 75, 044001 (2007)] showed that this kind of\ndynamical tide (DT) can induce phase shifts of 0.1 rad on gravitational\nwaveforms, which is detectable by third-generation (3G) detectors. In this\npaper, we study the impact of this DT on measuring neutron-star parameters in\nthe era of 3G detectors. We incorporate two universal relations among neutron\nstar properties predicted by different equations of state: (i) the well-known\nI-Love relation between momentum of inertia and (f-mode) tidal Love number, and\n(ii) a relation between the r-mode overlap and tidal Love number, which is\nnewly explored in this paper. We find that r-mode DT will provide rich\ninformation about slowly rotating neutron stars with frequency ranging from 10\nto 100 Hz. For a binary neutron star system (with a signal-to-noise ratio\naround 1500 in the Cosmic Explorer), the spin frequency of each individual\nneutron star can be constrained to 6% (fractional error) in the best-case\nscenario. The degeneracy between the Love numbers of individual neutron stars\nis dramatically reduced: each individual Love number can be constrained to\naround 20% in the best case, while the fractional error for both symmetric and\nanti-symmetric Love numbers are reduced by factors of around 300. Furthermore,\nDT also allows us to measure the spin inclination angles of the neutron stars,\nto 0.09 rad in the best case, and thus place constraints on NS natal kicks and\nsupernova explosion models.

Unfortunately, this tradeoff still\nlimits the size of tractable problems since the increased depth is often not\nrealizable before noise dominates. Here, we develop qubit-efficient quantum\nalgorithms for entanglement spectroscopy which avoid this tradeoff. In\nparticular, we develop algorithms for computing the trace of the n-th power of\nthe density operator of a quantum system, $Tr(\\rho^n)$, (related to the R\\'enyi\nentropy of order n) that use fewer qubits than any previous efficient algorithm\nwhile achieving similar performance in the presence of noise, thus enabling\nspectroscopy of larger quantum systems on NISQ devices. Our algorithms, which\nrequire a number of qubits independent of n, are variants of previous\nalgorithms with width proportional to n, an asymptotic difference. The crucial\ningredient in these new algorithms is the ability to measure and reinitialize\nsubsets of qubits in the course of the computation, allowing us to reuse qubits\nand increase the circuit depth without suffering the usual noisy consequences.\nWe also introduce the notion of effective circuit depth as a generalization of\nstandard circuit depth suitable for circuits with qubit resets.

In this paper, an internal reward\nfunction-based driving model that emulates the human's decision-making\nmechanism is utilized. To infer the reward function parameters from\nnaturalistic human driving data, we propose a structural assumption about human\ndriving behavior that focuses on discrete latent driving intentions. It\nconverts the continuous behavior modeling problem to a discrete setting and\nthus makes maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) tractable to\nlearn reward functions. Specifically, a polynomial trajectory sampler is\nadopted to generate candidate trajectories considering high-level intentions\nand approximate the partition function in the maximum entropy IRL framework. An\nenvironment model considering interactive behaviors among the ego and\nsurrounding vehicles is built to better estimate the generated trajectories.\nThe proposed method is applied to learn personalized reward functions for\nindividual human drivers from the NGSIM highway driving dataset.

The coexistence of\nferroelectricity and metallicity in a material appears to be illusive, since\npolarization is ill-defined in metals, where the itinerant electrons are\nexpected to screen the long-range dipole interactions necessary for dipole\nordering. The surprising discovery of the polar metal, LiOsO3 has generated\ninterest in searching for new polar metals motivated by the prospects of exotic\nquantum phenomena such as unconventional pairing mechanisms giving rise to\nsuperconductivity, topological spin currents, anisotropic upper critical\nfields, and Mott multiferroics. Previous studies have suggested that the\ncoordination preferences of the Li atom play a key role in stabilizing the\npolar metal phase of LiOsO3, but a thorough understanding of how polar order\nand metallicity can coexist remains elusive. Here, we use XUV-SHG as novel\ntechnique to directly probe the broken inversion-symmetry around the Li atom.\nOur results agree with previous theories that the primary structural distortion\nthat gives rise to the polar metal phase in LiOsO3 is a consequence of a\nsub-Angstrom Li atom displacement along the polar axis. A remarkable agreement\nbetween our experimental results and ab initio calculations provide physical\ninsights for connecting the nonlinear response to unit-cell spatial\nasymmetries. It is shown that XUV-SHG can selectively probe inversion-breaking\nsymmetry in a bulk material with elemental specificity. Compared to optical SHG\nmethods, XUV-SHG fills a key gap for studying structural asymmetries when the\nstructural distortion is energetically separated from the Fermi surface.\nFurther, these results pave the way for time-resolved probing of\nsymmetry-breaking structural phase transitions on femtosecond timescales with\nelement specificity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Oct 2020 03:29:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Oct 2020 16:02:38 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2020 21:02:01 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 11 Dec 2020 05:01:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-14"}

As such, applying adversarial manipulations to heterogeneous datasets\nhas proved to be a challenging task, and no generic attack method was suggested\nthus far.

A key assumption for the majority of these algorithms is\nthat the gradient of the objective function is globally Lipschitz continuous,\nbut many contemporary problems such as tensor decomposition fail to satisfy\nsuch an assumption. This paper develops a sequential local optimization (SLO)\nframework of first-order algorithms that can effectively optimize problems\nwithout Lipschitz gradient. Operating on the assumption that the gradients are\n{\\it locally} Lipschitz continuous over any compact set, the proposed framework\ncarefully restricts the distance between two successive iterates. We show that\nthe proposed framework can easily adapt to existing first-order methods such as\ngradient descent (GD), normalized gradient descent (NGD), accelerated gradient\ndescent (AGD), as well as GD with Armijo line search. Remarkably, the latter\nalgorithm is totally parameter-free and do not even require the knowledge of\nlocal Lipschitz constants.\n  We show that for the proposed algorithms to achieve gradient error bound of\n$\\|\\nabla f(x)\\|^2\\le \\epsilon$, it requires at most\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\times \\mathcal{L}(Y))$ total access to the\ngradient oracle, where $\\mathcal{L}(Y)$ characterizes how the local Lipschitz\nconstants grow with the size of a given set $Y$. Moreover, we show that the\nvariant of AGD improves the dependency on both $\\epsilon$ and the growth\nfunction $\\mathcal{L}(Y)$. The proposed algorithms complement the existing\nBregman Proximal Gradient (BPG) algorithm, because they do not require the\nglobal information about problem structure to construct and solve Bregman\nproximal mappings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Oct 2020 06:03:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-08"}

However, the\nstructural variety of native sophorolipids is limited/restricted, a limiting\nfact for the development of new properties and their potential applications. In\ntheir open acidic form, C18:1 sophorolipids (SL) are classically composed of a\nsophorose headgroup and a carboxylic acid (COOH) end-group.

Indeed, communication might be slow and\ncostly. Recent advances in communication-efficient training algorithms have\nreduced this bottleneck by using compression techniques, in the form of\nsparsification, quantization, or low-rank approximation. Since compression is a\nlossy, or inexact, process, the iteration complexity is typically worsened; but\nthe total communication complexity can improve significantly, possibly leading\nto large computation time savings. In this paper, we investigate the\nfundamental trade-off between the number of bits needed to encode compressed\nvectors and the compression error. We perform both worst-case and average-case\nanalysis, providing tight lower bounds. In the worst-case analysis, we\nintroduce an efficient compression operator, Sparse Dithering, which is very\nclose to the lower bound. In the average-case analysis, we design a simple\ncompression operator, Spherical Compression, which naturally achieves the lower\nbound.

The release\nof commercial VR Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs) has been a major contributing\nfactor. However, there is still much to be learned, especially how views and\ninput techniques, as well as their interaction, affect the VR experience. There\nis little work done on First-Person Shooter (FPS) games in VR, and those few\nstudies have focused on a single aspect of VR FPS. They either focused on the\nview, e.g., comparing VR to a typical 2D display or on the controller types. To\nthe best of our knowledge, there are no studies investigating variations of\n2D/3D views in HMDs, controller types, and their interactions. As such, it is\nchallenging to distinguish findings related to the controller type from those\nrelated to the view. If a study does not control for the input method and finds\nthat 2D displays lead to higher performance than VR, we cannot generalize the\nresults because of the confounding variables. To understand their interaction,\nwe propose to analyze in more depth, whether it is the view (2D vs. 3D) or the\nway it is controlled that gives the platforms their respective advantages. To\nstudy the effects of the 2D/3D views, we created a 2D visual technique,\nPlaneFrame, that was applied inside the VR headset. Our results show that the\ncontroller type can have a significant positive impact on performance,\nimmersion, and simulator sickness when associated with a 2D view. They further\nour understanding of the interactions that controllers and views have and\ndemonstrate that comparisons are highly dependent on how both factors go\ntogether.

The\nperformance in reduction of COD, via electrocoagulation (EC) or UV photolysis\nor, finally, operating electrocoagulation and photolysis in sequence was\nexamined. The effect of voltage and reaction time on COD reduction, as well as\nthe phytotoxicity were determined. Treated effluents were analysed by UV\nspectroscopy, extracting the organic components with solvents differing in\npolarity. A sequential EC and UV treatment of the tannery wastewater has been\nproven effective in the reduction of COD. These treatments combined afforded\n94.1 % of COD reduction, whereas the single EC and UV treatments afforded\nrespectively 85.7 and 55.9 %. The final COD value of 428.7 mg/L was found\nlargely below the limit of 1000 mg/L for admission of wastewater in public\nsewerage network. Germination tests of Hordeum Vulgare seeds indicated reduced\ntoxicity for the remediated water.

Still, numerical modelling allows us to study the VHE $\\gamma$-ray\nsource population in the Milky Way based on this sample. In this work, several\nazimuth-symmetric and spiral-arm models are compared for spatial source\ndistribution. The luminosity and radius function of the population are derived\nfrom the source properties of the HGPS data set and are corrected for the\nsensitivity bias of the HGPS. Based on these models, VHE source populations are\nsimulated and the subsets of sources detectable according to the HGPS are\ncompared with HGPS sources. The power-law indices of luminosity and radius\nfunctions are determined to range between $-1.6$ and $-1.9$ for luminosity and\n$-1.1$ and $-1.6$ for radius. Azimuth-symmetric distributions and a\ndistribution following a four-arm spiral structure without Galactic bar\ndescribe the HGPS data reasonably well. The total number of Galactic VHE\nsources is predicted to be in the range from 800 to 7000 with a total\nluminosity and flux of $(1.6-6.3) \\cdot 10^{36}$~ph~s$^{-1}$ and $(3-15) \\cdot\n10^{-10}$~ph~cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$, respectively.

Suppose that it possesses a parameter dependent\ninitial condition and a parameter dependent stable hyperbolic equilibrium\npoint. It is valuable to determine the set of parameter values, which we call\nthe recovery set, whose corresponding initial conditions lie within the region\nof attraction of the corresponding stable equilibrium point. A boundary\nparameter value is a parameter value whose corresponding initial condition lies\nin the boundary of the region of attraction of the corresponding stable\nequilibrium point. Prior algorithms numerically estimated the recovery set by\nestimating its boundary via computation of boundary parameter values. The\nprimary purpose of this work is to provide theoretical justification for those\nalgorithms for a large class of parameter dependent vector fields. This\nincludes proving that, for these vector fields, the boundary of the recovery\nset consists of boundary parameter values, and that the properties exploited by\nthe algorithms to compute these desired boundary parameters will be satisfied.\nThe main technical result which these proofs rely on is establishing that the\nregion of attraction boundary varies continuously in an appropriate sense with\nrespect to small variation in parameter value for this class of vector fields.\nHence, the majority of this work is devoted to proving this result, which may\nbe of independent interest.

Unfortunately, the approach is based on Ricci\nnotation and hence cannot be incorporated into automatic differentiation\nframeworks from deep learning like TensorFlow, PyTorch, autograd, or JAX that\nuse the simpler Einstein notation.

By varying some of their geometrical parameters\nkites can be transformed into squares, rhombuses, triangles, and also very\nelongated particles, even reaching the hard-needle limit. Thus a fluid of hard\nkites, depending on the particle shape, can stabilize isotropic, nematic,\ntetratic and triatic phases.

Kites with one of their unequal\nangles fixed to $72^{\\circ}$, which have been recently studied via Monte Carlo\nsimulations, are also considered.

This is particularly relevant for\nplanets of M-stars, because these stars stay active for a long time during\ntheir evolution and yet potentially habitable planets orbit at short distance.\nUnfortunately, not much is known about the relation between flares and CMEs in\nM-stars as only very few CMEs have so far been observed in M-stars. In order to\nlearn more about flares and CMEs on M-stars we monitored the active M-star EV\nLac spectroscopically at high resolution. We find 27 flares with energies\nbetween 1.6E31 and 1.4E32 erg in Halpha during 127 hours of spectroscopic\nmonitoring and 49 flares with energies between 6.3E31 and 1.1E33 erg during the\n457 hours of TESS observation. Statistical analysis shows that the ratio of the\ncontinuum flux in the TESS-band to the energy emitted in Halpha is 10.408 +/-\n0.026. Analysis of the spectra shows an increase in the flux of the He II 4686\n{\\AA} line during the impulsive phase of some flares.

By combining non-parametric Bayesian inference with\nphysically-motivated constraints, we develop an efficient learning algorithm\nwhich automates the construction of approximate free energy functionals. In\ncontrast to optimisation-based machine learning approaches, which seek to\nminimise a cost function, the central idea of the proposed Bayesian inference\nis to propagate a set of prior assumptions through the model, derived from\nphysical principles. The experimental data is used to probabilistically weigh\nthe possible model predictions. This naturally leads to humanly interpretable\nalgorithms with full uncertainty quantification of predictions. In our case,\nthe output of the learning algorithm is a probability distribution over a\nfamily of free energy functionals, consistent with the observed particle data.\nWe find that surprisingly small data samples contain sufficient information for\ninferring highly accurate analytic expressions of the underlying free energy\nfunctionals, making our algorithm highly data efficient.

At that point the field $\\chi$\nbegins to oscillate and acts as a \"magnetomorphic\" Dark Matter component,\ninheriting the properties of the primordial magnetic field space distribution.\nIn particular, for a nearly flat spectrum of magnetic field fluctuations, the\nscalar $\\chi$ carries a statistically anisotropic isocurvature mode. We discuss\nthe parameter space of the model and consider the possibility that the bulk of\nthe Dark Matter is composed of the same particles $\\chi$ produced via the\nfreeze-in mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Oct 2020 12:52:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 16 Oct 2020 13:03:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-11"}

The\nconventional CA limitations do not allow accurate simulation of pedestrian\nmovements on slopes with different angels.

We introduce two\ndifferent variants of this probabilistic problem, one that entails\nprobabilistic strategies over nodes (node-based problem) and a second one that\nentails probabilistic strategies over sets of nodes (set-based problem). While\nthe original deterministic problem involving the maximin criterion has been\nshown to be inapproximable, interestingly, we show that both probabilistic\nvariants permit approximation algorithms that achieve a constant multiplicative\nfactor of 1-1/e plus an additive arbitrarily small error that is due to the\nsimulation of the information spread. For an experimental study, we provide\nimplementations of multiplicative-weight routines for both problems and compare\nthe achieved fairness values to existing methods.

Almost sure termination (AST) is concerned with the\nquestion whether a program terminates with probability one on all possible\ninputs. Positive almost sure termination (PAST) focuses on termination in a\nfinite expected number of steps. This paper presents a fully automated approach\nto the termination analysis of probabilistic while-programs whose guards and\nexpressions are polynomial expressions. As proving (positive) AST is\nundecidable in general, existing proof rules typically provide sufficient\nconditions. These conditions mostly involve constraints on supermartingales. We\nconsider four proof rules from the literature and extend these with\ngeneralizations of existing proof rules for (P)AST.

In the 1990's it was discovered, that conversational speech between two\nhumans turns out to be considerably more difficult than read speech as\nhesitations, disfluencies, false starts and sloppy articulation complicate\nacoustic processing and require robust handling of acoustic, lexical and\nlanguage context, jointly. Early attempts with statistical models could only\nreach error rates over 50% and far from human performance (WER of around 5.5%).\nNeural hybrid models and recent attention-based encoder-decoder models have\nconsiderably improved performance as such contexts can now be learned in an\nintegral fashion.

The various\nobservational successes of inflationary models drive the scientific community\ninto elaborating more and more stringent tests, which can simultaneously be\nused to probe beyond the simple slow-roll, single field inflation. However,\ninflation is not a theory, and going beyond inflation is a necessity. Various\nalternatives and/or complementary mechanisms to inflation have been invoked in\nthe literature. The best-known cosmological models endowed with the capacity of\nexplaining large-scale observations while avoiding the singularity form a class\ncalled non-singular bouncing models. The main features of these models are the\npresence of a contraction phase before expansion, and a never-vanishing scale\nfactor. A non-singular bounce generally appears when quantum effects are part\nof the model, playing the role of a regulator leading to the avoidance of\nsingularities. This thesis focuses on a Hamiltonian formulation of quantum\neffects in cosmology. We first explore stochastic perturbations in a collapsing\nuniverse. Then, we show that quantum cosmology with Bohmian mechanics resolves\nthe initial singularity. Adding a non-minimal coupling of gravity with\nelectromagnetism, we show that the generation of magnetic fields is possible.\nFinally, we apply the affine quantisation on the Brans-Dicke Theory, the\nprototype of modified gravity theories, and we discuss the quantum equivalence\nof the Jordan and Einstein frames within this framework. We show that in both\nframes a smooth bounce is expected, and that equivalence between frames holds\nat the quantum level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Oct 2020 14:56:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-08"}

The vast majority of metrics employed for\nevaluating non-linear image reconstruction are based on some form of global\nimage fidelity, such as image root mean square error (RMSE). Use of such\nmetrics can lead to over-regularization in the sense that they can favor\nremoval of subtle details in the image. To address this shortcoming, we develop\nan image quality metric based on signal detection that serves as a surrogate to\nthe qualitative loss of fine image details. Methods: The metric is demonstrated\nin the context of a breast CT simulation, where different equal-dose\nconfigurations are considered. The configurations differ in the number of\nprojections acquired. Image reconstruction is performed with a non-linear\nalgorithm based on total variation constrained least-squares (TV-LSQ). The\nimages are evaluated visually, with image RMSE, and with the proposed\nsignal-detection based metric. The latter uses a small signal, and computes\ndetectability in the sinogram and in the reconstructed image. Loss of signal\ndetectability through the image reconstruction process is taken as a\nquantitative measure of loss of fine details in the image. Results: Loss of\nsignal detectability is seen to correlate well with the blocky or patchy\nappearance due to over-regularization with TV-LSQ, and this trend runs counter\nto the image RMSE metric, which tends to favor the over-regularized images.\nConclusions: The proposed signal detection based metric provides an image\nquality assessment that is complimentary to that of image RMSE. Using the two\nmetrics in concert may yield a useful prescription for determining CT algorithm\nand configuration parameters when non-linear image reconstruction is used.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Oct 2020 15:14:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 9 Dec 2020 04:20:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

However, these improvements only consider limited types of\ninformation sources and ignore the fact that the priority a seed input to be\nfuzzed may be influenced by all the code it covers. Based on the above\nobservations, we propose a fuzzing method based on the importance of functions.\nFirst, a data structure called Attributed Interprocedural Control Flow Graph\n(AICFG) is devised to combine different features of code fragments. Second, the\nimportance of each node in the AICFG is calculated based on an improved\nPageRank algorithm, which also models the influence between connected nodes.\nDuring the fuzzing process, the node importance is updated periodically by a\npropagation algorithm. Then the seed selection and energy scheduling of a seed\ninput are determined by the importance of its execution trace. We implement\nthis approach on top of AFL in a tool named FunAFL and conduct an evaluation on\n14 real-world programs against AFL and two of its improvements.

The\noptical properties were obtained by spectroscopic ellipsometry, while valence\nband spectra were probed by high-resolution x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.\nThe experimental results are directly compared to first-principles density\nfunctional theory + U calculations. Computational results confirm that gap\nstates are present in both NiO systems with vacancies.

The absorption spectra of the NiO:VNi sample show significant\ndefect-induced features below 3.0 eV compared to NiO and NiO:VO samples. The\nincrease in sub-gap absorptions in NiO:VNi can be attributed to gap states\nobserved in the electronic density of states.

One direct observational method to determine the disc M/L is\nby calculating the surface mass density of the disc from the stellar vertical\nvelocity dispersion and the scale height of the disc. Usually, the scale height\nis obtained from near-IR studies of edge-on galaxies and pertains to the older,\nkinematically hotter stars in the disc, while the vertical velocity dispersion\nof stars is measured in the optical band and refers to stars of all ages (up to\n~10 Gyr) and velocity dispersions.

There\nis a broader context that is often not considered within AI and HRI: that the\nproblem of trustworthiness is inherently socio-technical and ultimately\ninvolves a broad set of complex human factors and multidimensional\nrelationships that can arise between agents, humans, organizations, and even\ngovernments and legal institutions, each with their own understanding and\ndefinitions of trust.

Likewise, the brain networks' complexity arises from interactions\nbeyond pair connections, as it is simplistic to assume that in complex networks\nstate of a link is independently determined only according to its two\nconstituting nodes. This is particularly of note in genetically complex brain\nimpairments, such as the autism spectrum disorder (ASD), which has a surprising\nheterogeneity in manifestations with no clear-cut neuropathology. Accordingly,\nstructural balance theory (SBT) affirms that in real-world signed networks, a\nlink is remarkably influenced by each of its two nodes' interactions with the\nthird node within a triadic interrelationship. Thus, it is plausible to ask\nwhether ASD is associated with altered structural balance resulting from\natypical triadic interactions. In other words, it is the abnormal interplay of\npositive and negative interactions that matters in ASD, besides and beyond hypo\n(hyper) pair connectivity. To address this question, we explore triadic\ninteractions based on SBT in the weighted signed resting-state functional\nmagnetic resonance imaging networks of participants with ASD relative to\nhealthy controls (CON). We demonstrate that balanced triads are overrepresented\nin the ASD and CON networks while unbalanced triads are underrepresented,\nproviding first-time empirical evidence for the strong notion of structural\nbalance on the brain networks. We further analyze the frequency and energy\ndistributions of different triads and suggest an alternative description for\nthe reduced functional integration and segregation in the ASD brain networks.\nMoreover, results reveal that the scale of change in the whole-brain networks'\nenergy is more narrow in the ASD networks during development.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2020 16:28:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 2020 13:14:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 14 Oct 2021 10:43:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-19"}

The applications of remote telesurgery range from building medical\nclinics in underprivileged areas, to placing robots abroad in military\nhot-spots where accessibility and diversity of medical experience may be\nlimited. Poor wireless connectivity may result in a prolonged delay, referred\nto as latency, between a surgeon's input and action a robot takes. In surgery,\nany micro-delay can injure a patient severely and in some cases, result in\nfatality. One was to increase safety is to mitigate the effects of latency\nusing deep learning aided computer vision. While the current surgical robots\nuse calibrated sensors to measure the position of the arms and tools, in this\nwork we present a purely optical approach that provides a measurement of the\ntool position in relation to the patient's tissues.
