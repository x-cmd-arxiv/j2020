It uses the neural process to learn a distribution over\nfunctions conditioned on context sets and provide the mean and standard\ndeviation at target sets. Moreover, the proposed framework also takes into\naccount the available physical laws that govern the data and imposes them as\nconstraints in the loss function. The multi-fidelity physical constraint\nnetwork (MFPC-Net) (1) takes datasets obtained from multiple models at the same\ntime in the training, (2) takes advantage of available physical information,\n(3) learns a stochastic process which can encode prior beliefs about the\ncorrelation between two fidelity with a few observations, and (4) produces\npredictions with uncertainty. The ability of representing a class of functions\nis ensured by the property of neural process and is achieved by the global\nlatent variables in the neural network.

Although, such overflow events are\nrare, they have significant negative impacts on content providers, Internet\nservice providers, and end-users.

We measured the band\nareas and depths of a 4-micron feature in these spectra, which has been\nattributed to sulfur dioxide (SO2), as well as carbonates, in previously\ncollected datasets of this moon. All eight spectra we collected display the\n4-micron band. The four spectra collected over Callisto's leading hemisphere\ndisplay significantly stronger 4-micron bands compared to the four trailing\nhemisphere spectra (> 3-sigma difference). We compared the central wavelength\nposition and shape of Callisto's 4-micron band to laboratory spectra of various\nsulfur-bearing species and carbonates. Our comparison demonstrates that\nCallisto's 4-micron band has a spectral signature similar to thermally-altered\nsulfur, as well as a 4.025 micron feature attributed to disulfanide (HS2). Our\nanalysis therefore supports the presence of S-bearing species on Callisto but\nis not consistent with the presence of SO2. The significantly stronger 4-micron\nband detected on Callisto's leading hemisphere could result from collisions\nwith H2S-rich dust grains that originate on Jupiter's retrograde irregular\nsatellites or implantation of magnetospheric S ions that originate from\nvolcanic activity on Io. Alternatively, S-bearing species could be native to\nCallisto and are exposed by dust collisions and larger impacts that drive\nregolith overturn, primarily on its leading side.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Oct 2020 17:21:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-28"}

The state-of-the-art\nday-time depth estimation methods fail miserably when tested with night-time\nimages due to a large domain shift between them. The usual photo metric losses\nused for training these networks may not work for night-time images due to the\nabsence of uniform lighting which is commonly present in day-time images,\nmaking it a difficult problem to solve. We propose to solve this problem by\nposing it as a domain adaptation problem where a network trained with day-time\nimages is adapted to work for night-time images. Specifically, an encoder is\ntrained to generate features from night-time images that are indistinguishable\nfrom those obtained from day-time images by using a PatchGAN-based adversarial\ndiscriminative learning method. Unlike the existing methods that directly adapt\ndepth prediction (network output), we propose to adapt feature maps obtained\nfrom the encoder network so that a pre-trained day-time depth decoder can be\ndirectly used for predicting depth from these adapted features. Hence, the\nresulting method is termed as \"Adversarial Domain Feature Adaptation (ADFA)\"\nand its efficacy is demonstrated through experimentation on the challenging\nOxford night driving dataset. Also, The modular encoder-decoder architecture\nfor the proposed ADFA method allows us to use the encoder module as a feature\nextractor which can be used in many other applications. One such application is\ndemonstrated where the features obtained from our adapted encoder network are\nshown to outperform other state-of-the-art methods in a visual place\nrecognition problem, thereby, further establishing the usefulness and\neffectiveness of the proposed approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Oct 2020 17:55:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-06"}

However, standard distribution\nsolutions are not fault-tolerant. In this work, we present a simple grid\nstructure as a more reliable clock propagation method and study it by means of\nsimulation experiments. Fault-tolerance is achieved by forwarding clock pulses\non arrival of the second of three incoming signals from the previous layer.\n  A key question is how well neighboring grid nodes are synchronized, even\nwithout faults. Analyzing the clock skew under typical-case conditions is\nhighly challenging. Because the forwarding mechanism involves taking the\nmedian, standard probabilistic tools fail, even when modeling link delays just\nby unbiased coin flips.\n  Our statistical approach provides substantial evidence that this system\nperforms surprisingly well. Specifically, in an \"infinitely wide\" grid of\nheight~$H$, the delay at a pre-selected node exhibits a standard deviation of\n$O(H^{1/4})$ ($\\approx 2.7$ link delay uncertainties for $H=2000$) and skew\nbetween adjacent nodes of $o(\\log \\log H)$ ($\\approx 0.77$ link delay\nuncertainties for $H=2000$). We conclude that the proposed system is a very\npromising clock distribution method. This leads to the open problem of a\nstochastic explanation of the tight concentration of delays and skews. More\ngenerally, we believe that understanding our very simple abstraction of the\nsystem is of mathematical interest in its own right.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Oct 2020 19:27:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-06"}

In contrast,\nintelligent behaviour in biological organisms is characterised by the ability\nto plan over varying temporal scales depending on the context. Inspired by the\nrecent works on human time perception, we devise a novel approach to learning a\ntransition dynamics model, based on the sequences of episodic memories that\ndefine the agent's subjective timescale - over which it learns world dynamics\nand over which future planning is performed. We implement this in the framework\nof active inference and demonstrate that the resulting subjective-timescale\nmodel (STM) can systematically vary the temporal extent of its predictions\nwhile preserving the same computational efficiency. Additionally, we show that\nSTM predictions are more likely to introduce future salient events (for example\nnew objects coming into view), incentivising exploration of new areas of the\nenvironment. As a result, STM produces more informative action-conditioned\nroll-outs that assist the agent in making better decisions.

Concurrently, the past two decades have\nseen an explosion of the use of Machine Learning (ML) methods that are also\nincreasingly employed in astronomy.\n  I will first describe the construction of a ML classifier to improve a widely\nadopted classification scheme for Young Stellar Object (YSO) candidates.

The combination of YSO identification\nand Gaia distance measurements then enables the reconstruction of dense cloud\nstructures in 3D. Our ML classifier is based on Artificial Neural Networks\n(ANN) and uses IR data from the Spitzer space telescope to reconstruct the YSO\nclassification automatically from given examples.\n  In a second part, I will propose a new method for reconstructing the 3D\nextinction distribution of the MW based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).\nThe CNN is trained using a large-scale Galactic model, the Besan\\c{c}on Galaxy\nModel, and learns to infer the extinction distance distribution by comparing\nresults of the model with observed data.

EVs need to be charged, but the number of charging piles in a\nCharging Station (CS) is limited and charging is usually more time-consuming\nthan fueling. According to this scenario, we propose a secure and efficient\ncharging scheduling system based on a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)-blockchain\nand double auction mechanism. In a smart area, it attempts to assign EVs to the\navailable CSs in the light of their submitted charging requests and status\ninformation. First, we design a lightweight charging scheduling framework that\nintegrates DAG-blockchain and modern cryptography technology to ensure security\nand scalability during performing scheduling and completing tradings. In this\nprocess, a constrained multi-item double auction problem is formulated because\nof the limited charging resources in a CS, which motivates EVs and CSs in this\narea to participate in the market based on their preferences and statuses. Due\nto this constraint, our problem is more complicated and harder to achieve\ntruthfulness as well as system efficiency compared to the existing double\nauction model. To adapt to it, we propose two algorithms, namely Truthful\nMechanism for Charging (TMC) and Efficient Mechanism for Charging (EMC), to\ndetermine an assignment between EVs and CSs and pricing strategies.

LEGAN disentangles the lighting and expression\nsubspaces and performs transformations in the feature space before upscaling to\nthe desired output image. The fidelity of the synthetic image is further\nrefined by integrating a perceptual quality estimation model, trained with face\nimages rendered using multiple synthesis methods and their crowd-sourced\nnaturalness ratings, into the LEGAN framework as an auxiliary discriminator.\nUsing objective metrics like FID and LPIPS, LEGAN is shown to generate higher\nquality face images when compared with popular GAN models like StarGAN and\nStarGAN-v2 for lighting and expression synthesis.

The\nnetwork is trained to estimate diffeomorphic spatial transformations between\npairs of images by maximizing an image-wise similarity metric between fixed and\nwarped moving images, similar to conventional image registration algorithms. It\nis implemented in a multi-resolution image registration framework to optimize\nand learn spatial transformations at different image resolutions jointly and\nincrementally with deep self-supervision in order to better handle large\ndeformation between images. A spatial Gaussian smoothing kernel is integrated\nwith the FCNs to yield sufficiently smooth deformation fields to achieve\ndiffeomorphic image registration. Particularly, spatial transformations learned\nat coarser resolutions are utilized to warp the moving image, which is\nsubsequently used for learning incremental transformations at finer\nresolutions. This procedure proceeds recursively to the full image resolution\nand the accumulated transformations serve as the final transformation to warp\nthe moving image at the finest resolution.

In our experiments, the rotation period is\nfixed when varying the stellar flux, in order to more clearly isolate the role\nof pN2.

This is due to the competing effects of five\nprocesses: pressure broadening, heat capacity, lapse rate, relative humidity,\nand clouds. These competing processes increase the complexity in predicting the\nlocation of the inner edge of the habitable zone. For a slow rotation orbit of\n60 Earth days, the critical stellar flux for the runaway greenhouse onset is\n1700--1750, 1900--1950, and 1750--1800 W m$^{-2}$ under 0.25, 1.0, and 4.0 bar\nof pN2, respectively, suggesting that the magnitude of the effect of pN2 is\nwithin ~13%. For a rapid rotation orbit, the effect of varying pN2 on the inner\nedge is smaller, within a range of ~7%.

Here, we\ndeveloped a Bessel ultrasonic transducer for large depth of field by using\nconical acoustic lens. An acoustic lens is attached to a unfocused ultrasonic.\nAnd the acoustic lens is a cuboid prism with a concave cone on the bottom, made\nof fused silica. Similar to an axicon that can generate a Bessel beam, the\nBessel ultrasonic transducer can produce nondiffracting Bessel ultrasonic\nbeams.

To solve this problem,\nwe propose to first decompose joint action spaces into restricted role action\nspaces by clustering actions according to their effects on the environment and\nother agents.

Such\nproblems arise in engineering and scientific applications, which possess a\nmulti-resolution control nature, and thus may be formulated either by means of\nlow-resolution variants (providing coarser approximations with presumably lower\naccuracy for the general problem) or by high-resolution controls. A particular\nscientific application concerns practical Quantum Control (QC) problems, whose\ntargeted optimal controls may be discretized to increasingly higher resolution,\nwhich in turn carries the potential to obtain better control yields. However,\nstate-of-the-art derivative-free optimization heuristics for high-resolution\nformulations nominally call for an impractically large number of objective\nfunction calls. Therefore, an effective algorithmic treatment for such problems\nis needed.

To alleviate the learning\ndifficulties caused by modality-specific appearance discrepancy, we first\npresent an Image Alignment Module (IAM) to narrow the appearance gap between\nassistant and target modality data.We then propose a novel Mutual Knowledge\nDistillation (MKD) scheme to thoroughly exploit the modality-shared knowledge\nto facilitate the target-modality segmentation. To be specific, we formulate\nour framework as an integration of two individual segmentors. Each segmentor\nnot only explicitly extracts one modality knowledge from corresponding\nannotations, but also implicitly explores another modality knowledge from its\ncounterpart in mutual-guided manner. The ensemble of two segmentors would\nfurther integrate the knowledge from both modalities and generate reliable\nsegmentation results on target modality. Experimental results on the public\nmulti-class cardiac segmentation data, i.e., MMWHS 2017, show that our method\nachieves large improvements on CT segmentation by utilizing additional MRI data\nand outperforms other state-of-the-art multi-modality learning methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Oct 2020 10:25:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-06"}

Under\ncertain assumptions, whitening the activations reduces the Fisher information\nmatrix to a simple identity matrix, in which case stochastic gradient descent\nis equivalent to the faster natural gradient descent.

In this work, we address the complexity drawbacks of feature\nwhitening. Our contribution is twofold. First, we derive an equivalent method,\nwhich replaces the sample transformations by a transformation to the weight\ngradients, applied to every batch of B samples. The complexity is reduced by a\nfactor of S=(2B), where S denotes the feature dimension of the layer output. As\nthe batch size increases with distributed training, the benefit of using the\nproposed method becomes more compelling.

By taking an FPGA code that was over four times slower than\nrunning on the CPU, mainly due to data movement overhead, we describe the\nprofiling and optimisation strategies adopted to significantly reduce the\nruntime and bring the performance of our FPGA kernels to a much more practical\nlevel for real-world use. The result of this work is a set of techniques,\nsteps, and lessons learnt that we have found significantly improves the\nperformance of FPGA based HPC codes and that others can adopt in their own\ncodes to achieve similar results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Oct 2020 11:30:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-06"}

Textual\ndescription of the same scene can vary greatly from person to person, or\nsometimes even for the same person from time to time. As the choice of words\nand syntax vary while preparing a textual description, it is challenging for\nthe system to reliably produce a consistently desirable output from different\nforms of language input. The prior works of scene generation have been mostly\nconfined to rigorous sentence structures of text input which restrict the\nfreedom of users to write description. In our work, we study a new pipeline\nthat aims to generate static as well as animated 3D scenes from different types\nof free-form textual scene description without any major restriction. In\nparticular, to keep our study practical and tractable, we focus on a small\nsubspace of all possible 3D scenes, containing various combinations of cube,\ncylinder and sphere. We design a two-stage pipeline. In the first stage, we\nencode the free-form text using an encoder-decoder neural architecture. In the\nsecond stage, we generate a 3D scene based on the generated encoding. Our\nneural architecture exploits state-of-the-art language model as encoder to\nleverage rich contextual encoding and a new multi-head decoder to predict\nmultiple features of an object in the scene simultaneously. For our\nexperiments, we generate a large synthetic data-set which contains 13,00,000\nand 14,00,000 samples of unique static and animated scene descriptions,\nrespectively. We achieve 98.427% accuracy on test data set in detecting the 3D\nobjects features successfully. Our work shows a proof of concept of one\napproach towards solving the problem, and we believe with enough training data,\nthe same pipeline can be expanded to handle even broader set of 3D scene\ngeneration problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Oct 2020 11:31:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 28 Nov 2020 19:28:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-01"}

We\nintroduce a new, unified framework for building intermittent demand forecasting\nmodels, which incorporates and allows to generalize existing methods in several\ndirections. Our framework is based on extensions of well-established\nmodel-based methods to discrete-time renewal processes, which can\nparsimoniously account for patterns such as aging, clustering and\nquasi-periodicity in demand arrivals. The connection to discrete-time renewal\nprocesses allows not only for a principled extension of Croston-type models,\nbut also for an natural inclusion of neural network based models---by replacing\nexponential smoothing with a recurrent neural network. We also demonstrate that\nmodeling continuous-time demand arrivals, i.e., with a temporal point process,\nis possible via a trivial extension of our framework. This leads to more\nflexible modeling in scenarios where data of individual purchase orders are\ndirectly available with granular timestamps. Complementing this theoretical\nadvancement, we demonstrate the efficacy of our framework for forecasting\npractice via an extensive empirical study on standard intermittent demand data\nsets, in which we report predictive accuracy in a variety of scenarios that\ncompares favorably to the state of the art.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Oct 2020 11:32:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-06"}

We found that the new $\\Delta\\nu$-${\\bar \\rho}$ relation for\nrotating models is compatible with previous works. We explained the dispersion\nof the points around the linear fits as caused mainly by the distribution of\nthe stellar mass, and partially by the evolutionary stage. The new fit is found\nto be close to the previous theoretical studies for lower masses\n($1.3-1.81\\,\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$). However, the opposite holds for the\nobservations: for the higher masses ($1.81-3\\,\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$) the fit is\nmore compatible with the empirical relation. We applied these results to\ncharacterise the two well-known $\\delta$ Scuti stars observed by CoRoT,\nHD174936 and HD174966, and compared the physical parameters with those of\nprevious works. Inclusion of rotation in the modelling causes a tendency\ntowards greater masses, radii, luminosities and lower density values.\nComparison between $\\Delta\\nu$ and Gaia's luminosities also allowed us to\nconstraint the inclination angles and rotational velocities of both stars. The\npresent results pave the way to systematically constrain the angle of\ninclination of $\\delta$ Scuti stars\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Oct 2020 12:33:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-06"}

However, given\nonly data of individual activities, it is challenging to infer the dynamics of\nleaders and followers. In this paper, we focus on mining and modeling frequent\npatterns of leading and following. We formalize new computational problems and\npropose a framework that can be used to address several questions regarding\ngroup movement. We use the leadership inference framework, mFLICA, to infer the\ntime series of leaders and their factions from movement datasets and then\npropose an approach to mine and model frequent patterns of both leadership and\nfollowership dynamics. We evaluate our framework performance by using several\nsimulated datasets, as well as the real-world dataset of baboon movement to\ndemonstrate the applications of our framework. These are novel computational\nproblems and, to the best of our knowledge, there are no existing comparable\nmethods to address them. Thus, we modify and extend an existing leadership\ninference framework to provide a non-trivial baseline for comparison. Our\nframework performs better than this baseline in all datasets.

Twelve MUSE pointings in wide field mode form a mosaic of\nthe central 3.3'x2.4'. We use the tool PyParadise to fit the stellar\npopulation. We use the residual emission lines and the residual interstellar\nabsorption NaI D-lines, and we measure line strengths, the velocity field, and\nthe velocity dispersion field. The emission lines resemble LINER lines, with\n[NII] being the strongest line everywhere. Ionising sources are plausibly the\npost-asymptotic giant branch stars of the old or intermediate-age stellar\npopulation. There is a striking match between the dust structures, ionised gas,\nand atomic gas distributions, the last of which is manifested by interstellar\nabsorption residuals of the stellar NaI D-lines. In the dust-free regions, the\ninterstellar NaI D-lines appear in emission, which is indicative of a galactic\nwind. The velocity field of the ionised gas (and thus of the dust) is\ncharacterised by small-scale turbulent movements that indicate short lifetimes.\nAt the very centre, a bipolar velocity field of the ionised gas is observed,\nwhich we interpret as an outflow. We identify a strongly inclined gaseous dusty\ndisc along the major axis of NGC1316. A straight beam of ionised gas with a\nlength of about 4 kpc emanates from the centre. Our findings are strongly\nsuggestive of a dusty outflow. Nuclear outflows may be important dust-producing\nmachines in galaxies.

Besides the difficulty of perturbing\ndiscrete words and the sentence fluency problem faced by attackers in any NLP\ntasks, there is a specific challenge to attackers of structured prediction\nmodels: the structured output of structured prediction models is sensitive to\nsmall perturbations in the input. To address these problems, we propose a novel\nand unified framework that learns to attack a structured prediction model using\na sequence-to-sequence model with feedbacks from multiple reference models of\nthe same structured prediction task.

A double emulsion\nconsisting of a regular train of coated microdroplets was created upstream of\nthe channel expansion, so that the inter-drop distance, droplet length,\nvelocity and coating thickness could be varied by imposing different inlet\npressures, albeit not independently. Provided that the enlarged channel remains\nsufficiently confined to prohibit propagation in double file, droplets can\nassemble sequentially into regular linear clusters at the expansion. Droplets\njoin a cluster via the coalescence of their coating film with that of the group\nahead. This coalescence occurs when the droplets approach each other to within\na critical distance at the expansion, enabled by hydrodynamic interactions\nwithin the train. Clusters comprising a finite number of droplets are obtained\nbecause reconfiguration of the droplet assembly during coalescence increases\nthe distance to the following droplet.
