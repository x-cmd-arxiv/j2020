The intuition is to exploit neighbors with similar preferences for\nbridging unseen user-item pairs and alleviating data sparseness. Many existing\nworks propose neural attention networks to aggregate neighbors and place higher\nweights on specific subsets of users for recommendation. However, the\nneighborhood information is not necessarily always informative, and the noises\nin the neighborhood can negatively affect the model performance. To address\nthis issue, we propose a novel neighborhood-based recommender, where a hybrid\ngated network is designed to automatically separate similar neighbors from\ndissimilar (noisy) ones, and aggregate those similar neighbors to comprise\nneighborhood representations. The confidence in the neighborhood is also\naddressed by putting higher weights on the neighborhood representations if we\nare confident with the neighborhood information, and vice versa. In addition, a\nuser-neighbor component is proposed to explicitly regularize user-neighbor\nproximity in the latent space. These two components are combined into a unified\nmodel to complement each other for the recommendation task. Extensive\nexperiments on three publicly available datasets show that the proposed model\nconsistently outperforms state-of-the-art neighborhood-based recommenders. We\nalso study different variants of the proposed model to justify the underlying\nintuition of the proposed hybrid gated network and user-neighbor modeling\ncomponents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 08:06:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-20"}

The modern version of this paradigm, which we owe to\nWilson, proposes that the supernova shock wave is powered by neutrino heating,\nmediated by the absorption of electron-flavor neutrinos and antineutrinos\nemanating from the proto-neutron star surface, or neutrinosphere. Neutrino weak\ninteractions with the stellar core fluid, the theory of which is still\nevolving, are flavor and energy dependent. The associated neutrino mean free\npaths extend over many orders of magnitude and are never always small relative\nto the stellar core radius. Thus, neutrinos are never always fluid like.\nInstead, a kinetic description of them in terms of distribution functions that\ndetermine the number density of neutrinos in the six-dimensional phase space of\nposition, direction, and energy, for both neutrinos and antineutrinos of each\nflavor, or in terms of angular moments of these neutrino distributions that\ninstead provide neutrino number densities in the four-dimensional phase-space\nsubspace of position and energy, is needed. In turn, the computational\nchallenge is twofold: (i) to map the kinetic equations governing the evolution\nof these distributions or moments onto discrete representations that are\nstable, accurate, and, perhaps most important, respect physical laws such as\nconservation of lepton number and energy and the Fermi--Dirac nature of\nneutrinos and (ii) to develop efficient, supercomputer-architecture-aware\nsolution methods for the resultant nonlinear algebraic equations. In this\nreview, we present the current state of the art in attempts to meet this\nchallenge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Oct 2020 16:03:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-20"}

The composites are assumed to possess periodic\nmicrostructure and be subjected to a remote field. At the microscale,\nfinite-strain micromechanical analysis based on the homogenization technique\nfor the (intact) composite is employed for the prediction of the effective\ndeformation. At the macroscale, a procedure, based on the representative cell\nmethod and the associated higher-order theory, is developed for the\ndetermination of the elastic field in the damaged composite. The periodic\ncomposite is discretized into identical cells and then reduced to the problem\nof a single cell by application of the discrete Fourier transform. The\nresulting governing equations, interfacial and boundary conditions in the\nFourier transform domain, are solved by employing the higher-order theory in\nconjunction with an iterative procedure to treat the effects of damage and\nmaterial nonlinearity. The initial conditions for the iterative solution are\nobtained using the weakly-nonlinear material limit and a natural fixed-point\niteration. A locally-convergent low-memory Quasi-Newton solver is then\nemployed.

One of the unsolved long-standing problems of these\nenigmatic celestial bodies is the origin of pulsars' glitches, i.e., the sudden\nrapid deceleration in the rotation speed of neutron stars. Although many glitch\nevents have been reported, there is no consensus on the microscopic mechanism\nresponsible for them. One of the important characterizations of the glitches is\nthe scaling law $P(E) \\sim E^{-\\alpha}$ of the probability distribution for a\nglitch with energy $E$.

Recently, the probabilistic\nVariational AutoEncoder (VAE) has become a popular model for anomaly detection\nin applications such as lesion detection in medical images. The VAE is a\ngenerative graphical model that is used to learn the data distribution from\nsamples and then generate new samples from this distribution. By training on\nnormal samples, the VAE can be used to detect inputs that deviate from this\nlearned distribution. The VAE models the output as a conditionally independent\nGaussian characterized by means and variances for each output dimension. VAEs\ncan therefore use reconstruction probability instead of reconstruction error\nfor anomaly detection. Unfortunately, joint optimization of both mean and\nvariance in the VAE leads to the well-known problem of shrinkage or\nunderestimation of variance. We describe an alternative approach that avoids\nthis variance shrinkage problem by using quantile regression. Using estimated\nquantiles to compute mean and variance under the Gaussian assumption, we\ncompute reconstruction probability as a principled approach to outlier or\nanomaly detection. Results on simulated and Fashion MNIST data demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our approach.

Here we show that\nthe Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will efficiently test this claim\nwith standard sirens at high redshift, defined by the coincident gravitational\nwave (GW) and electromagnetic (EM) observations of the merger of massive black\nhole binaries (MBHBs). Assuming a fiducial $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology for\ngenerating mock standard siren datasets, the evidence for the $\\Lambda$CDM\nmodel with respect to an alternative model inferred from quasar data is\ninvestigated. By simulating many realizations of possible future LISA\nobservations, we find that for $50\\%$ of these realizations (median result) 4\nMBHB standard siren measurements will suffice to strongly differentiate between\nthe two models, while 14 standard sirens will yield a similar result in $95\\%$\nof the realizations. In addition, we investigate the measurement precision of\ncosmological parameters as a function of the number of observed LISA MBHB\nstandard sirens, finding that 15 events will on average achieve a relative\nprecision of 5\\% for $H_0$, reducing to 3\\% and 2\\% with 25 and 40 events,\nrespectively.

However, decades of\nwork in behavioral economics have questioned the validity of both foundations.\nMeanwhile, computational neuroscience has contributed a modernized 'dual\nprocess' account of decision-making where model-free (MF) reinforcement\nlearning trades off with model-based (MB) reinforcement learning. The former\ncaptures habitual and procedural learning while the latter captures choices\ntaken via explicit planning and deduction. Some conventions (e.g. international\ntreaties) are likely supported by cognition that resonates with the game\ntheoretic and MB accounts. However, convention formation may also occur via MF\nmechanisms like habit learning; though this possibility has been understudied.\nHere, we demonstrate that complex, large-scale conventions can emerge from MF\nlearning mechanisms. This suggests that some conventions may be supported by\nhabit-like cognition rather than explicit reasoning. We apply MF multi-agent\nreinforcement learning to a temporo-spatially extended game with incomplete\ninformation. In this game, large parts of the state space are reachable only by\ncollective action. However, heterogeneity of tastes makes such coordinated\naction difficult: multiple equilibria are desirable for all players, but\nsubgroups prefer a particular equilibrium over all others. This creates a\ncoordination problem that can be solved by establishing a convention. We\ninvestigate start-up and free rider subproblems as well as the effects of group\nsize, intensity of intrinsic preference, and salience on the emergence dynamics\nof coordination conventions. Results of our simulations show agents establish\nand switch between conventions, even working against their own preferred\noutcome when doing so is necessary for effective coordination.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Oct 2020 18:18:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2020 18:11:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-15"}

In this paper, we address the\nproblems of i) how a system can identify which of the queried labels are wrong\nand ii) how a multi-class active learning system can be adapted to minimize the\nnegative impact of label noise. Towards solving the problems, we propose a\nnoisy label filtering based learning approach where the inter-relationship\n(context) that is quite common in natural data is utilized to detect the wrong\nlabels. We construct a graphical representation of the unlabeled data to encode\nthese relationships and obtain new beliefs on the graph when noisy labels are\navailable. Comparing the new beliefs with the prior relational information, we\ngenerate a dissimilarity score to detect the incorrect labels and update the\nrecognition model with correct labels which result in better recognition\nperformance. This is demonstrated in three different applications: scene\nclassification, activity classification, and document classification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Oct 2020 18:59:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-20"}

Most\nexisting approaches address this problem as deterministic regression of future\nfeatures or future predictions given observed frames.

When a deterministic model\nconfronts such situation, its best guess is to forecast the most likely\noutcome. However, this is not acceptable since it defeats the purpose of\nforecasting to improve security. It also throws away valuable training data,\nsince a deterministic model is unable to learn any deviation from the norm.

These constraints have consequences for important tasks such as\ncooling, not directly captured by the second law of thermodynamics. Here, we\nstudy catalytic transformations that cannot be achieved when a system\nexclusively interacts with a finite environment. Our core result consists of\nconstructive conditions for these transformations, which include the\ncorresponding global unitary operation and the explicit states of all the\nsystems involved. From this result we present various findings regarding the\nuse of catalysts for cooling. First, we show that catalytic cooling is always\npossible if the dimension of the catalyst is sufficiently large. In particular,\nthe cooling of a qubit using a hot qubit can be maximized with a catalyst as\nsmall as a three-level system. We also identify catalytic enhancements for\ntasks whose implementation is possible without a catalyst. For example, we find\nthat in a multiqubit setup catalytic cooling based on a three-body interaction\noutperforms standard (non-catalytic) cooling using higher order interactions.\nAnother advantage is illustrated in a thermometry scenario, where a qubit is\nemployed to probe the temperature of the environment.

Meanwhile, experimental language designs have\nsuggested effect handlers as a unifying solution to programmer-defined control\neffects, subsuming exceptions, generators, and async--await. Despite these\ntrends, complex control flow---in particular, control flow exhibiting a\nbidirectional pattern---remains challenging to manage.\n  We introduce bidirectional algebraic effects, a new programming abstraction\nthat supports bidirectional control transfer in a more natural way. Handlers of\nbidirectional effects can raise further effects to transfer control back to the\nsite where the initiating effect was raised, and can use themselves to handle\ntheir own effects. We present applications of this expressive power, which\nfalls out naturally as we push toward the unification of effectful programming\nwith object-oriented programming. We pin down the mechanism and the unification\nformally using a core language that generalizes to effect operations and effect\nhandlers.\n  The usual propagation semantics of control effects such as exceptions\nconflicts with modular reasoning in the presence of effect polymorphism---it\nbreaks parametricity. Bidirectionality exacerbates the problem. Hence, we set\nout to show the core language, which builds on the existing tunneling semantics\nfor algebraic effects, is not only type-safe (no effects go unhandled), but\nalso abstraction-safe (no effects are accidentally handled). We devise a\nstep-indexed logical-relations model, and construct its parametricity and\nsoundness proofs. These core results are fully mechanized in Coq. Preliminary\nexperiments show that as a first-class language feature, bidirectional handlers\ncan be implemented efficiently.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Oct 2020 19:28:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-20"}

It is often implicitly assumed that the poisoned\nclassifier is vulnerable exclusively to the adversary who possesses the\ntrigger. In this paper, we show empirically that this view of backdoored\nclassifiers is incorrect. We describe a new threat model for poisoned\nclassifier, where one without knowledge of the original trigger, would want to\ncontrol the poisoned classifier. Under this threat model, we propose a\ntest-time, human-in-the-loop attack method to generate multiple effective\nalternative triggers without access to the initial backdoor and the training\ndata. We construct these alternative triggers by first generating adversarial\nexamples for a smoothed version of the classifier, created with a procedure\ncalled Denoised Smoothing, and then extracting colors or cropped portions of\nsmoothed adversarial images with human interaction. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our attack through extensive experiments on high-resolution\ndatasets: ImageNet and TrojAI. We also compare our approach to previous work on\nmodeling trigger distributions and find that our method are more scalable and\nefficient in generating effective triggers. Last, we include a user study which\ndemonstrates that our method allows users to easily determine the existence of\nsuch backdoors in existing poisoned classifiers.

Although the L\\'evy-Lorentz gas seems to be accepted as a model\nfor anomalous diffusion, our findings suggest that superdiffusion is a\ntransient behavior which develops into normal diffusion on long timescales, and\nraise a new question about how the transition from the quenched normal\ndiffusion to the annealed superdiffusion occurs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Oct 2020 19:46:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 19 Feb 2021 11:02:14 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 16 Feb 2022 16:32:07 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 1 Sep 2022 20:09:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-24"}

Current methods for\ngait recognition have been dominated by deep learning models, notably those\nbased on partial feature representations. In this context, we propose a novel\ndeep network, learning to transfer multi-scale partial gait representations\nusing capsules to obtain more discriminative gait features. Our network first\nobtains multi-scale partial representations using a state-of-the-art deep\npartial feature extractor. It then recurrently learns the correlations and\nco-occurrences of the patterns among the partial features in forward and\nbackward directions using Bi-directional Gated Recurrent Units (BGRU). Finally,\na capsule network is adopted to learn deeper part-whole relationships and\nassigns more weights to the more relevant features while ignoring the spurious\ndimensions. That way, we obtain final features that are more robust to both\nviewing and appearance changes. The performance of our method has been\nextensively tested on two gait recognition datasets, CASIA-B and OU-MVLP, using\nfour challenging test protocols.

Recent\ndefenses have been shown to improve adversarial robustness by detecting\nanomalous deviations from legitimate training samples at different layer\nrepresentations - a behavior normally exhibited by adversarial attacks. Despite\ntechnical differences, all aforementioned methods share a common backbone\nstructure that we formalize and highlight in this contribution, as it can help\nin identifying promising research directions and drawbacks of existing methods.\nThe first main contribution of this work is the review of these detection\nmethods in the form of a unifying framework designed to accommodate both\nexisting defenses and newer ones to come. In terms of drawbacks, the\novermentioned defenses require comparing input samples against an oversized\nnumber of reference prototypes, possibly at different representation layers,\ndramatically worsening the test-time efficiency. Besides, such defenses are\ntypically based on ensembling classifiers with heuristic methods, rather than\noptimizing the whole architecture in an end-to-end manner to better perform\ndetection. As a second main contribution of this work, we introduce FADER, a\nnovel technique for speeding up detection-based methods. FADER overcome the\nissues above by employing RBF networks as detectors: by fixing the number of\nrequired prototypes, the runtime complexity of adversarial examples detectors\ncan be controlled. Our experiments outline up to 73x prototypes reduction\ncompared to analyzed detectors for MNIST dataset and up to 50x for CIFAR10\ndataset respectively, without sacrificing classification accuracy on both clean\nand adversarial data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Oct 2020 22:00:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-20"}

This represents an important parameter for\nastrochemical models, crucial to determine the chemical fate of complex organic\nmolecules formed on dust grains and observed in the densest regions of the\ninterstellar medium. In this work, we propose a new robust procedure to study\nthe interaction of atoms and molecules with interstellar ices, based on\n\\textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics and density functional theory, validated\nby high-level \\textit{ab initio} methods at a CCSD(T)/CBS level. We have\napplied this procedure to hydrogen fluoride (HF), a promising tracer of the\nmolecular content of galaxies. In total we found 13 unique equilibrium\nstructures of HF binding to small water clusters of up to 4 molecules, with\nbinding energies ranging from 1208 to 7162 K. We computed a 22-molecules model\nof amorphous solid water (ASW) surface using \\textit{ab initio} molecular\ndynamics simulations and carried out a systematic analysis of the binding sites\nof HF, in terms of binding modes and binding energies. Considering 10 different\nwater clusters, we found a binding energy distribution with an average value of\n$5313\\pm74$ K, and a dispersion of $921\\pm115$ K. Finally, the effect of the\nelectrostatic field of the 22 water molecules on the binding energies was\ninvestigated incrementally by symmetry adapted perturbation theory, in order to\ngauge the effect of the water environment. The results indicate that the extent\nof the electrostatic interaction of HF with ASW depends strongly on the\nproperties of the binding site. We expect that this work will provide a solid\nfoundation for a systematic development of a binding energy distribution\ndatabase of molecules on interstellar surfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Oct 2020 23:20:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-20"}

However, given a plan performed in\nobstacle-free space, it is relatively easy to find an obstacle geometry, where\nthis plan is optimal. We consider this \"dual\" problem of classical motion\nplanning and name this process of finding appropriate obstacle geometry as\nhallucination.

In this paper we explore the second explanation, by investigating the\nrelation between the amount of Technical Debt in new code and the evolution of\nTechnical Debt in the system. To this end, we compare the Technical Debt\nDensity of new code with existing code, and we investigate which of the three\nmajor types of code changes (additions, deletions and modifications) is\nprimarily responsible for changes in the evolution of Technical Debt density.\nFurthermore, we study whether there is a relation between code quality\npractices and the 'cleanness' of new code. To obtain the required data, we have\nperformed a large-scale case study on twenty-seven open-source software\nprojects by the Apache Software Foundation, analyzing 66,661 classes and 56,890\ncommits. The results suggest that writing \"clean\" (or at least \"cleaner\") new\ncode can be an efficient strategy for reducing Technical Debt Density, and thus\npreventing software decay over time. The findings also suggest that projects\nadopting an explicit policy for quality improvement, e.g. through discussions\non code quality in board meetings, are associated with a higher frequency of\ncleaner new code commits. Therefore, we champion the establishment of processes\nthat monitor the density of Technical Debt of new code to control the\naccumulation of Technical Debt in a software system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 01:08:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-20"}

On its own, Richards equation is already a nonlinear partial\ndifferential equation, and it is exceedingly difficult to solve numerically due\nto the extra nonlinear dependencies involving the soil water. To deal with\nmultiple scales, our strategy is that starting from a microscopic scale, we\nupscale the coupled system of dual-continuum Richards equations via\nhomogenization by the two-scale asymptotic expansion, to obtain a homogenized\nsystem, at an intermediate scale (level). Based on a hierarchical approach, the\nhomogenization's effective coefficients are computed through solving the\narising cell problems. To tackle the nonlinearity, after time discretization,\nwe use Picard iteration procedure for linearization of the homogenized Richards\nequations. At each Picard iteration, some degree of multiscale still remains\nfrom the intermediate level, so we utilize the generalized multiscale finite\nelement method (GMsFEM) combining with a multi-continuum approach, to upscale\nthe homogenized system to a macroscopic (coarse-grid) level. This scheme\ninvolves building uncoupled and coupled multiscale basis functions, which are\nused not only to construct coarse-grid solution approximation with high\naccuracy but also (with the coupled multiscale basis) to capture the\ninteractions among continua.

As the binary orbit\nshrinks due to gravitational radiation, the power and speed of this\nbinary-induced inspiral wind may (depending on pair loading) secularly\nincrease, leading to self-interaction and internal shocks in the outflow beyond\nthe binary orbit. The magnetized forward shock can generate coherent radio\nemission via the synchrotron maser process, resulting in an observable radio\nprecursor to binary NS merger. We perform 1D relativistic hydrodynamical\nsimulations of shock interaction in the accelerating binary NS wind, assuming\nthat the inspiral wind efficiently converts its Poynting flux into bulk kinetic\nenergy prior to the shock radius.

We map out a phase\ndiagram in terms of population imbalance, and look at the system size\ndependence of the steady state imbalance. We find non-monotonic behaviour of\nimbalance with system parameters, which contradicts the idea that the\nrelaxation of an initial imbalance is fixed only by the ratio of number of\nextended states to number of localized states. We propose that there exists\ndimensionless parameters, which depend on the fraction of single particle\nlocalized states, single particle extended states and the mean participation\nratio of these states. These ingredients fully control the imbalance in the\nlong time limit and we present numerical evidence of this claim. Among the four\nmodels considered, three of them have interesting duality relations and their\nlocation of mobility edges are known. One of the models (next nearest neighbour\ncoupling) has no known duality but mobility edge exists and the model has been\nexperimentally realized. Our findings are an important step forward to\nunderstanding non-equilibrium phenomena in a family of interesting models with\nincommensurate potentials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 06:33:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-19"}

Federated learning architecture relies on smart\ndevices, such as smartphones and IoT sensors, that collect and process their\nown data, so sensitive information never has to leave the client device.\nRather, clients train a sub-model locally and send an encrypted update to the\ncentral server for aggregation into the global model.

The platform determines the ride prices over\nthe transportation network to maximize its profit, while the regulatory agency\nimposes the congestion charge to reduce traffic congestion in the urban core. A\nnetwork economic equilibrium model is proposed to capture the intimate\ninteractions among passenger demand, driver supply, passenger and driver\nwaiting times, platform pricing, vehicle repositioning and flow balance over\nthe transportation network. The overall optimal pricing problem is cast as a\nnon-convex program. An algorithm is proposed to approximately compute its\noptimal solution, and a tight upper bound is established to evaluate its\nperformance loss with respect to the globally optimal solution. Using the\nproposed model, we compare the impacts of three forms of congestion charge: (a)\na one-directional cordon charge on ride-sourcing vehicles that enter the\ncongestion area; (b) a bi-directional cordon charge on ride-sourcing vehicles\nthat enter or exit the congestion area; (c) a trip-based congestion charge on\nall ride-sourcing trips. We show that the one-directional congestion charge not\nonly reduces the ride-sourcing traffic in the congestion area, but also reduces\nthe travel cost outside the congestion zone and benefits passengers in these\nunderserved areas. We further show that compared to other congestion charges,\nthe one-directional cordon charge is more effective in congestion mitigation:\nto achieve the same congestion-mitigation target, it imposes a smaller cost on\npassengers, drivers, and the platform. On the other hand, compared with the\nother charges, the trip-based congestion charge is more effective in\nrevenue-raising: to raise the same tax revenue, it leads to a smaller loss to\npassengers, drivers, and the platform.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 07:03:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 2 Jan 2021 14:36:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 2021 05:22:12 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 17 Jul 2021 05:31:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-20"}

Since the presence of a line gap\nimplies the existence of a point gap, there is usually more than one\nmathematical classification applicable to a physical system. That raises the\nquestion: which of these gap-type classifications is physically meaningful?\n  To decide this question, I propose a simple criterion, namely the choice of\nphysically relevant states. This generalizes the notion of Fermi projection\nthat plays a crucial role in the topological classification of fermionic\ncondensed matter systems, and enters as an auxiliary quantity in the bulk\nclassification of photonic and magnonic crystals.

The SPOD eigenvalues at a given streamwise ($x$)\nlocation are functions of azimuthal wavenumber ($m$), frequency ($\\Str$), and\nSPOD index ($n$). By $x/D =10$, two specific modes dominate the fluctuation\nenergy: (i) the vortex shedding (VS) mode with $m=1, \\Str =0.135, n=1$, and\n(ii) the double helix (DH) mode with $m=2, \\Str \\rightarrow 0, n=1$. The VS\nmode is more energetic than the DH mode in the near wake but, in the far wake,\nit is the DH mode which is dominant. The DH mode, when scaled with local\nturbulent velocity and length scales, shows self-similarity in eigenvalues and\neigenmodes while the VS mode, which is a global mode, does not exhibit strict\nself-similarity. Modes $m = 0$, 3 and 4, although subdominant, also make a\nsignificant net contribution to the fluctuation energy, and their eigenspectra\nare evaluated. The reconstruction of TKE and Reynolds shear stress, $\\langle\nu'_{x} u'_{r} \\rangle$, is evaluated by varying $(m,\\Str,n)$ combinations.\nHigher SPOD modes contribute significantly to the TKE, especially near the\ncenterline.

Among these methods, Gradient-based meta-learning algorithms\nare a specific sub-class that excel at quick adaptation to new tasks with\nlimited data.

However, the\nexisting meta-learning approaches only depend on the current task information\nduring the adaptation, and do not share the meta-knowledge of how a similar\ntask has been adapted before. To address this gap, we propose a 'Path-aware'\nmodel-agnostic meta-learning approach. Specifically, our approach not only\nlearns a good initialization for adaptation, it also learns an optimal way to\nadapt these parameters to a set of task-specific parameters, with learnable\nupdate directions, learning rates and, most importantly, the way updates evolve\nover different time-steps. Compared to the existing meta-learning methods, our\napproach offers: (a) The ability to learn gradient-preconditioning at different\ntime-steps of the inner-loop, thereby modeling the dynamic learning behavior\nshared across tasks, and (b) The capability of aggregating the learning context\nthrough the provision of direct gradient-skip connections from the old\ntime-steps, thus avoiding overfitting and improving generalization. In essence,\nour approach not only learns a transferable initialization, but also models the\noptimal update directions, learning rates, and task-specific learning trends.\nSpecifically, in terms of learning trends, our approach determines the way\nupdate directions shape up as the task-specific learning progresses and how the\nprevious update history helps in the current update.

Previous studies often search for an optimal solution in relatively\nlarge space. To enhance the performance of the search process, two approaches\nare proposed: the first approach seeks for solutions as a set of edges. From\nthe original graph, we generate a new graph whose vertex set's cardinality is\nmuch smaller than that of the original one. Consequently, an effective\nEvolutionary Algorithm (EA) is proposed for solving CluSPT. The second approach\nlooks for vertex-based solutions. The search space of the CluSPT is transformed\ninto 2 nested search spaces (NSS). With every candidate in the high-level\noptimization, the search engine in the lower level will find a corresponding\ncandidate to combine with it to create the best solution for CluSPT.\nAccordingly, Nested Local Search EA (N-LSEA) is introduced to search for the\noptimal solution on the NSS. When solving this model in lower level by N-LSEA,\nvariety of similar tasks are handled. Thus, Multifactorial Evolutionary\nAlgorithm applied in order to enhance the implicit genetic transfer across\nthese optimizations.

We start by analyzing how the networks react when subjected to\nincreasingly widespread random edge removal and the effect of spatial\ncorrelations with power-law decay.

We address the problem of inferring a causal direction from two\nobserved discrete symbolic sequences $X$ and $Y$. We present a framework which\nrelies on lossless compressors for inferring context-free grammars (CFGs) from\nsequence pairs and quantifies the extent to which the grammar inferred from one\nsequence compresses the other sequence. We infer $X$ causes $Y$ if the grammar\ninferred from $X$ better compresses $Y$ than in the other direction. To put\nthis notion to practice, we propose three models that use the\nCompression-Complexity Measures (CCMs) - Lempel-Ziv (LZ) complexity and\nEffort-To-Compress (ETC) to infer CFGs and discover causal directions without\ndemanding temporal structures. We evaluate these models on synthetic and\nreal-world benchmarks and empirically observe performances competitive with\ncurrent state-of-the-art methods. Lastly, we present two unique applications of\nthe proposed models for causal inference directly from pairs of genome\nsequences belonging to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Using a large number of sequences,\nwe show that our models capture directed causal information exchange between\nsequence pairs, presenting novel opportunities for addressing key issues such\nas contact-tracing, motif discovery, evolution of virulence and pathogenicity\nin future applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 09:19:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Oct 2020 11:46:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 17 Mar 2021 10:45:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-18"}

Research in IML has boomed in recent years. As young as the field\nis, it has over 200 years old roots in regression modeling and rule-based\nmachine learning, starting in the 1960s. Recently, many new IML methods have\nbeen proposed, many of them model-agnostic, but also interpretation techniques\nspecific to deep learning and tree-based ensembles. IML methods either directly\nanalyze model components, study sensitivity to input perturbations, or analyze\nlocal or global surrogate approximations of the ML model. The field approaches\na state of readiness and stability, with many methods not only proposed in\nresearch, but also implemented in open-source software. But many important\nchallenges remain for IML, such as dealing with dependent features, causal\ninterpretation, and uncertainty estimation, which need to be resolved for its\nsuccessful application to scientific problems. A further challenge is a missing\nrigorous definition of interpretability, which is accepted by the community. To\naddress the challenges and advance the field, we urge to recall our roots of\ninterpretable, data-driven modeling in statistics and (rule-based) ML, but also\nto consider other areas such as sensitivity analysis, causal inference, and the\nsocial sciences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 09:20:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-24"}

The propagation of light in\nsuch a cavity is modeled by a Gaussian beam, affected by the Earth's\ngravitational field. On laboratory scale, this field is described by the\nspacetime of homogeneous gravity, known as Rindler spacetime. In that\nspacetime, the beam is bent downwards and acquires a height dependent phase\nshift. As a consequence the phase fronts of the laser light differ from those\nof a usual Gaussian beam.

Consider two homogeneous ellipsoids orbiting around\neach other in fixed coplanar Keplerian orbits. Moreover, their respective spin\naxes are assumed to be perpendicular to the orbital plane, that is also a\ncommon equatorial plane. The spin-spin model deals with the coupled rotational\ndynamics of both ellipsoids. For a non-zero orbital eccentricity, it has the\nstructure of a non-autonomous system of coupled pendula. This model is a\nnatural extension of the classical spin-orbit problem for two extended bodies.\nIn addition, we consider dissipative tidal torques, that can trigger the\ncapture of the system into spin-orbit and spin-spin resonances. In this paper\nwe give some theoretical results for both the conservative model and the\ndissipative one. The conservative model has a Hamiltonian structure. We use\nproperties of Hamiltonian systems to give some sufficient conditions in the\nspace of parameters of the model, that guarantee existence, uniqueness and\nlinear stability of an odd periodic solution. This solution represents a double\nsynchronous resonance in the conservative regime. Such solution can be\ncontinued to the dissipative regime, where it becomes asymptotically stable. We\nsee asymptotic stability as a dynamical mechanism for the capture into the\ndouble synchronous resonance. Finally we apply our results to several cases\nincluding the Pluto-Charon binary system and the Trojan binary asteroid 617\nPatroclus, target of the LUCY mission.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 09:40:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-26"}

The different mathematical results are\nintroduced intuitively, before being rigorously stated. This tutorial describes\nmodern aspects of optimal control theory, with a particular focus on the\nPontryagin Maximum Principle, which is the main tool for determining open-loop\ncontrol laws without experimental feedback. The different steps to solve an\noptimal control problem are discussed, before moving on to more advanced topics\nsuch as the existence of optimal solutions or the definition of the different\ntypes of extremals, namely normal, abnormal, and singular. The tutorial covers\nvarious quantum control issues and describes their mathematical formulation\nsuitable for optimal control. The connection between the Pontryagin Maximum\nPrinciple and gradient-based optimization algorithms used for high-dimensional\nquantum systems is described. The optimal solution of different low-dimensional\nquantum systems is presented in detail, illustrating how the mathematical tools\nare applied in a practical way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 10:25:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 15 Sep 2021 13:11:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-16"}

Semiconductor\nnanowire photodetectors show a signature of photogating where G_Pc rolls-off\nwith increasing illumination intensity. We show that surface band bending due\nto depleted surface layers in nanowires induces a strong radial field (~ 108\nV/m at the nanowire surface) which causes physical separation of photogenerated\nelectron-hole pairs. This was established quantitatively through a\nself-consistent theoretical model based on coupled Schrodinger and Poisson\nEquations. It shows that carrier separation slows down the surface\nrecombination velocity to a low value (< 1 cm/s) thus reducing the carrier\nrecombination rate and extending the recombination lifetime by few orders of\nmagnitude. An important outcome of the model is the prediction of G_Pc ~ 106 in\na single Ge nanowire (with diameter 60 nm), which matches well with our\nexperimental observation. The model also shows an inverse dependence of G_Pc on\nthe diameter that has been observed experimentally. Though carried out in\ncontext of Ge nanowires, the physical model developed has general applicability\nin other semiconductor nanowires as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 10:27:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-20"}

The obstruction to such a lattice\nrealization is the failure to reproduce the quantum anomalies of a chiral\nfermion in continuum. The conventional way to escape is to associate the\nanomalous 1d system with a 2d bulk, which is in a topologically non-trivial\nstate, as the boundary of the latter. In this paper, we propose a 1+1D chiral\nfermion model on 1d spatial lattice, {standing alone} -- without being\nassociated with a 2d bulk -- with a simple {non-Hermitian} hopping Hamiltonian.\nWe demonstrate, using various methods, that the model possesses the same chiral\nanomaly and gravitational anomaly as in continuum theory. Furthermore, with\nappropriate parameters, the low energy effective theory of the model remains a\nfield theory for unitary chiral fermions.

Hence, scrupulous\nevaluations of trained models are required to avoid unsafe behaviours in the\noperational environment. However, designing metrics to measure the safety of a\nneural network is an open problem, since standard evaluation parameters (e.g.,\ntotal reward) are not informative enough. In this paper, we present a\nsemi-formal verification approach for decision-making tasks, based on interval\nanalysis, that addresses the computational demanding of previous verification\nframeworks and design metrics to measure the safety of the models. Our method\nobtains comparable results over standard benchmarks with respect to formal\nverifiers, while drastically reducing the computation time. Moreover, our\napproach allows to efficiently evaluate safety properties for decision-making\nmodels in practical applications such as mapless navigation for mobile robots\nand trajectory generation for manipulators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 11:18:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-20"}

In\norder to maintain a high predictive quality at all times, online learning\nmodels need to adapt to distributional changes, which are known as concept\ndrift. The timely and robust identification of concept drift can be difficult,\nas we never have access to the true distribution of streaming data. In this\nwork, we propose a novel framework for the detection of real concept drift,\ncalled ERICS. By treating the parameters of a predictive model as random\nvariables, we show that concept drift corresponds to a change in the\ndistribution of optimal parameters. To this end, we adopt common measures from\ninformation theory. The proposed framework is completely model-agnostic. By\nchoosing an appropriate base model, ERICS is also capable to detect concept\ndrift at the input level, which is a significant advantage over existing\napproaches. An evaluation on several synthetic and real-world data sets\nsuggests that the proposed framework identifies concept drift more effectively\nand precisely than various existing works.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 11:19:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-31"}

We show that initializing the bidirectional NMT encoder\nwith a left-to-right language model and forcing the model to remember the\noriginal left-to-right language modeling task limits the learning capacity of\nthe encoder for the whole bidirectional context.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 11:51:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-20"}

However, since the unseen objects are\nnever visualized during training, the detection model is skewed towards seen\ncontent, thereby labeling unseen as background or a seen class. In this work,\nwe propose to synthesize visual features for unseen classes, so that the model\nlearns both seen and unseen objects in the visual domain. Consequently, the\nmajor challenge becomes, how to accurately synthesize unseen objects merely\nusing their class semantics? Towards this ambitious goal, we propose a novel\ngenerative model that uses class-semantics to not only generate the features\nbut also to discriminatively separate them. Further, using a unified model, we\nensure the synthesized features have high diversity that represents the\nintra-class differences and variable localization precision in the detected\nbounding boxes.

Differential scattering from a population of aligned,\nnon-spherical dust grains is a potential source of polarization that could be\nused to determine geometric properties of the dust clouds. This paper addresses\nthe problem of the spheroidal growth of dust grains in electrically activated\nsub-stellar atmospheres. It presents the novel application of a mechanism\nwhereby non-spherical, elongated dust grains can be grown via plasma deposition\nas a consequence of the surface electric field effects of charged dust grains.\nWe numerically solve the differential equations governing the spheroidal growth\nof charged dust grains via plasma deposition as a result of surface electric\nfield effects in order to determine how the dust eccentricity and the dust\nparticle eccentricity distribution function evolve with time. From these\nresults, we determine the effect of spheroidal dust on the observed linear\npolarization. Numerical solutions show that $e\\approx 0.94$ defines a watershed\neccentricity, where the eccentricity of grains with an initial eccentricity\nless than (greater than) this value decreases (increases) and spherical\n(spheroidal) growth occurs. This produces a characteristic bimodal eccentricity\ndistribution function yielding a fractional change in the observed linear\npolarization of up to $\\approx0.1$ corresponding to dust grains of maximal\neccentricity at wavelengths of $\\approx1 \\mu$m, consistent with the near\ninfrared observational window. The results presented here are relevant to the\ngrowth of non-spherical, irregularly shaped dust grains of general geometry\nwhere non-uniform surface electric field effects of charged dust grains are\nsignificant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 12:47:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-04"}

There has been\nsubstantial interest in semi-supervised learning (SSL) which aims to leverage\nunlabeled data to improve estimation or prediction. However, current SSL\nliterature focuses primarily on settings where labeled data is selected\nrandomly from the population of interest. Non-random sampling, while posing\nadditional analytical challenges, is highly applicable to many real world\nproblems. Moreover, no SSL methods currently exist for estimating the\nprediction performance of a fitted model under non-random sampling. In this\npaper, we propose a two-step SSL procedure for evaluating a prediction rule\nderived from a working binary regression model based on the Brier score and\noverall misclassification rate under stratified sampling. In step I, we impute\nthe missing labels via weighted regression with nonlinear basis functions to\naccount for nonrandom sampling and to improve efficiency. In step II, we\naugment the initial imputations to ensure the consistency of the resulting\nestimators regardless of the specification of the prediction model or the\nimputation model. The final estimator is then obtained with the augmented\nimputations. We provide asymptotic theory and numerical studies illustrating\nthat our proposals outperform their supervised counterparts in terms of\nefficiency gain.

The cut-off problem asks if there exists\na number $B$ such that all initial configurations of the protocol with at least\n$B$ agents in a given initial state can reach a final configuration with all\nagents in a given final state. In a recent paper (Horn and Sangnier, CONCUR\n2020), Horn and Sangnier proved that the cut-off problem is decidable (and at\nleast as hard as the Petri net reachability problem) for protocols with a\nleader, and in EXPSPACE for leaderless protocols. Further, for the special\nclass of symmetric protocols they reduce these bounds to PSPACE and NP,\nrespectively. The problem of lowering these upper bounds or finding matching\nlower bounds was left open. We show that the cut-off problem is P-complete for\nleaderless protocols and in NC for leaderless symmetric protocols. Further, we\nalso consider a variant of the cut-off problem suggested in (Horn and Sangnier,\nCONCUR 2020), which we call the bounded-loss cut-off problem and prove that\nthis problem is P-complete for leaderless protocols and NL-complete for\nleaderless symmetric protocols.

In this paper, we visit the video-oriented face\nalignment problem in two perspectives: detection accuracy prefers lower error\nfor a single frame, and detection consistency forces better stability between\nadjacent frames. On this basis, we propose a Jitter loss function that\nleverages temporal information to suppress inaccurate as well as jittered\nlandmarks. The Jitter loss is involved in a novel framework with a fine-tuning\nConvLSTM structure over a backbone replaceable network. We further demonstrate\nthat accurate and stable landmarks are associated with different regions with\noverlaps in a canonical coordinate, based on which the proposed Jitter loss\nfacilitates the optimization process during training. The proposed framework\nachieves at least 40% improvement on stability evaluation metrics while\nenhancing detection accuracy versus state-of-the-art methods.

Hector enables offloading application logic to users, thereby\nimproving user experience with lower latencies while generating less costs for\nservice providers.

Hector combines WebAssembly for\nmulti-language computations at near-native speed, WebRTC for browser-to-browser\ncommunication and trusted execution as provided by the Intel Software Guard\nExtensions so browsers can trust each other's computations. We evaluate Hector\nby implementing a digital assistant as well as a recommendation system. Our\nevaluation shows that Hector achieves lower end-user latencies while generating\nless costs than traditional deployments.

Currently, the state-of-the-art\nsegmentation algorithms are based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs),\nwhich achieved remarkable performances in a standard Cartesian volumetric data.\nNevertheless, these approaches suffer the challenges of low efficiency and GPU\nunfriendly image size. Therefore, such difficulties and expensive hardware\nrequirements become a bottleneck to build accurate and efficient segmentation\nmodels for real clinical application. In this paper, we propose a novel Frustum\nultrasound based catheter segmentation method. Specifically, Frustum ultrasound\nis a polar coordinate based image, which includes same information of standard\nCartesian image but has much smaller size, which overcomes the bottleneck of\nefficiency than conventional Cartesian images. Nevertheless, the irregular and\ndeformed Frustum images lead to more efforts for accurate voxel-level\nannotation. To address this limitation, a weakly supervised learning framework\nis proposed, which only needs 3D bounding box annotations overlaying the\nregion-of-interest to training the CNNs. Although the bounding box annotation\nincludes noise and inaccurate annotation to mislead to model, it is addressed\nby the proposed pseudo label generated scheme. The labels of training voxels\nare generated by incorporating class activation maps with line filtering, which\nis iteratively updated during the training. Our experimental results show the\nproposed method achieved the state-of-the-art performance with an efficiency of\n0.25 second per volume. More crucially, the Frustum image segmentation provides\na much faster and cheaper solution for segmentation in 3D US image, which meet\nthe demands of clinical applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 13:56:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-01"}

Moreover, this approach facilitates the handling of large\ndeformations of the fluid domain respectively the fluid-structure interface\nwithout additional methodological and computational efforts. In particular, to\nachieve an accurate representation of interaction forces between fluid\nparticles and structural elements also for strongly curved interface\ngeometries, the novel sliding boundary particle approach is proposed to ensure\nfull support of SPH particles close to the interface.

However, finding a satisfying\nsimplified system model for complex dynamical systems usually requires a\nconsiderable amount of effort. To overcome this limitation, we propose in this\nwork a general data-driven approach that is able to efficiently learn a\nlow-dimensional representation of the safe region. Through an online adaptation\nmethod, the low-dimensional representation is updated by using the feedback\ndata such that more accurate safety estimates are obtained. The performance of\nthe proposed approach for identifying the low-dimensional representation of the\nsafe region is demonstrated with a quadcopter example. The results show that,\ncompared to previous work, a more reliable and representative low-dimensional\nrepresentation of the safe region is derived, which then extends the\napplicability of the safe reinforcement learning framework.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 14:32:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 8 Sep 2021 06:02:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-09"}

It allows us to deduce the modulus of the\nelectric and magnetic amplitudes together with the phase difference\nindividually.

In this study, we have developed\nan ensemble Deep Convolutional Neural Network-based classifier to classify\nwound images including surgical, diabetic, and venous ulcers, into\nmulti-classes. The output classification scores of two classifiers (patch-wise\nand image-wise) are fed into a Multi-Layer Perceptron to provide a superior\nclassification performance. A 5-fold cross-validation approach is used to\nevaluate the proposed method. We obtained maximum and average classification\naccuracy values of 96.4% and 94.28% for binary and 91.9\\% and 87.7\\% for\n3-class classification problems. The results show that our proposed method can\nbe used effectively as a decision support system in classification of wound\nimages or other related clinical applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 15:20:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-07"}

Methods:\nWe propose a novel, integrative, and neural network-based literature-based\ndiscovery (LBD) approach to identify drug candidates from both PubMed and\nCOVID-19-focused research literature. Our approach relies on semantic triples\nextracted using SemRep (via SemMedDB). We identified an informative subset of\nsemantic triples using filtering rules and an accuracy classifier developed on\na BERT variant, and used this subset to construct a knowledge graph. Five SOTA,\nneural knowledge graph completion algorithms were used to predict drug\nrepurposing candidates.

We first provide empirical evidence for this\nphenomenon via image classification experiments using both ResNets and the\nconvolutional neural tangent kernel (CNTK). We then present a novel linear\nregression framework for characterizing the impact of depth on test risk, and\nshow that increasing depth leads to a U-shaped test risk for the linear CNTK.\nIn particular, we prove that the linear CNTK corresponds to a depth-dependent\nlinear transformation on the original space and characterize properties of this\ntransformation. We then analyze over-parameterized linear regression under\narbitrary linear transformations and, in simplified settings, provably identify\nthe depths which minimize each of the bias and variance terms of the test risk.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 15:46:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Jun 2021 21:57:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-08"}

Many of these systems are\ninternally fragile and very sensitive to external factors and threats, which\nlead to unethical situations that require systemic solutions still centered on\nindividuals. Furthermore, the multi-layered net-like social tissue generates\nclusters of power that prevent certain communities from proper development.\nDigital technology has also impacted at the individual level posing the risk of\na more homogeneous, predictable and ultimately controllable humankind.

While these\nprotocols are very effective in protecting the confidentiality of the users'\ndata (e.g., credit card numbers), it has been shown that they are prone (to\ndifferent degrees) to adversaries aiming to breach the users' privacy. Traffic\nfingerprinting attacks allow an adversary to infer the webpage or the website\nloaded by a user based only on patterns in the user's encrypted traffic. In\nfact, many recent works managed to achieve a very high classification accuracy\nunder optimal conditions for the adversary.\n  This paper revisits the optimality assumptions made by those works and\ndiscusses various additional parameters that should be considered when\nevaluating a fingerprinting model. We propose three realistic scenarios\nsimulating non-optimal fingerprinting conditions where various factors could\naffect the adversary's performance or operation.

The prototypical microquasar GRS 1758-258 exhibits large-scale\nmorphological changes in radio maps over time which have been attributed to the\nrise of instabilities. Here, we investigate whether these effects could be\nattributed to jet precession instead. Methods.We used new and archival radio\nmaps to fit a kinematic jet precession model. The value of the parameters thus\nobtained were analysed in order to get constraints on the physical properties\nof the GRS 1758-258 system. Their consistency with different theories of the\norigins for the jet precession, such as Lense-Thirring effect and tidal torques\ninduced by the secondary star, has previously been studied.

The new radio data presented here confirm that the\nlarge-scale radio morphology of GRS 1758-258 is changing over time. Our study\nshows that the 18.48 day period could plausibly be ascribed to precession, thus\nimplying a reinterpretation of assumptions made for the orbital period to date.\nHowever, the observed structural changes in radio jets cannot be easily\nattributed to jet precession according to our analysis.
