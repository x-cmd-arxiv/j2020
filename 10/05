As such, it helps\nclinicians to decide on the optimal reperfusion treatment. In perfusion CT\nimaging, deconvolution methods are used to obtain clinically interpretable\nperfusion parameters that allow identifying brain tissue abnormalities.\nDeconvolution methods require the selection of two reference vascular functions\nas inputs to the model: the arterial input function (AIF) and the venous output\nfunction, with the AIF as the most critical model input. When manually\nperformed, the vascular function selection is time demanding, suffers from poor\nreproducibility and is subject to the professionals' experience. This leads to\npotentially unreliable quantification of the penumbra and core lesions and,\nhence, might harm the treatment decision process. In this work we automatize\nthe perfusion analysis with AIFNet, a fully automatic and end-to-end trainable\ndeep learning approach for estimating the vascular functions. Unlike previous\nmethods using clustering or segmentation techniques to select vascular voxels,\nAIFNet is directly optimized at the vascular function estimation, which allows\nto better recognise the time-curve profiles. Validation on the public ISLES18\nstroke database shows that AIFNet reaches inter-rater performance for the\nvascular function estimation and, subsequently, for the parameter maps and core\nlesion quantification obtained through deconvolution.

At the\nsame time, there are very few theoretical guarantees in the literature to\nexplain this apparent acceleration effect. Even for the classical strongly\nconvex quadratic problems, several existing results only show Polyak's momentum\nhas an accelerated linear rate asymptotically. In this paper, we first revisit\nthe quadratic problems and show a non-asymptotic accelerated linear rate of\nPolyak's momentum. Then, we provably show that Polyak's momentum achieves\nacceleration for training a one-layer wide ReLU network and a deep linear\nnetwork, which are perhaps the two most popular canonical models for studying\noptimization and deep learning in the literature.

One method to address this\nquestion has utilized a forward approach that propagates NSM rates and yields\nalong with stellar formation rates, in the end comparing those results with\nobserved chemical abundances of $r$-process-rich, metal-poor stars. In this\nwork, we take the inverse approach by utilizing $r$-process-element abundance\nratios of metal-poor stars as input to reconstruct the properties---especially\nthe masses---of the neutron star (NS) binary progenitors of the $r$-process\nstars. This novel analysis provides an independent avenue for studying the\npopulation of the original neutron star binary systems that merged and produced\nthe $r$-process material incorporated in Galactic metal-poor halo stars. We use\nratios of elements typically associated with the limited-$r$ process and the\nactinide region to those in the lanthanide region (i.e., Zr/Dy and Th/Dy) to\nprobe the NS masses of the progenitor merger. We find that NSMs can account for\nall $r$-process material in metal-poor stars that display $r$-process\nsignatures, while simultaneously reproducing the present-day distribution of\ndouble-NS (DNS) systems. However, the most $r$-process enhanced stars (the\n$r$-II stars) on their own would require progenitor NSMs of very asymmetric\nsystems that are distinctly different from present ones in the Galaxy.

For a fixed\narrangement of dipoles, we show that the topological phase depends critically\non the surrounding electromagnetic environment which mediates the dipole-dipole\ninteractions. To access different topological phases we embed the metasurface\ninside a cavity waveguide where one can tune the dominant dipolar coupling from\nshort-range Coulomb interactions to long-range photon-mediated interactions by\nreducing the cavity width; this results in a topological transition\ncharacterized by an inversion of the valley-Chern numbers.

At low temperatures a heavy\nFermi liquid emerges such that the neutral Majorana fermion excitations of the\nKitaev QSL acquire charge by hybridising with the graphene Dirac band. Using\nab-initio calculations to determine the parameters of our low energy model we\nprovide a microscopic theory of anomalous QOs with a non-LK temperature\ndependence consistent with our measurements. We show how remnants of\nfractionalized spin excitations can give rise to characteristic signatures in\nQO experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Oct 2020 18:39:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Mar 2021 21:28:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-24"}

In this paper,\nwe propose a general probabilistic methodology for feature selection in joint\nquantile time series analysis, under the name of quantile feature selection\ntime series (QFSTS) model. The QFSTS model is a general structural time series\nmodel, where each component yields an additive contribution to the time series\nmodeling with direct interpretations. Its flexibility is compound in the sense\nthat users can add/deduct components for each times series and each time series\ncan have its own specific valued components of different sizes. Feature\nselection is conducted in the quantile regression component, where each time\nseries has its own pool of contemporaneous external predictors allowing\n\"nowcasting\". Creative probabilistic methodology in extending feature selection\nto the quantile time series research area is developed by means of multivariate\nasymmetric Laplace distribution, ``spike-and-slab\" prior setup, the\nMetropolis-Hastings algorithm, and the Bayesian model averaging technique, all\nimplemented consistently in the Bayesian paradigm.

After a detailed analysis of\nthese \"traditional\" encoder-decoder based approaches, we observed that they\nperform poorly in detecting smaller structures and are unable to segment\nboundary regions precisely. This issue can be attributed to the increase in\nreceptive field size as we go deeper into the encoder. The extra focus on\nlearning high level features causes the U-Net based approaches to learn less\ninformation about low-level features which are crucial for detecting small\nstructures.

One of the main challenges is that the level of risk an investor\ncan endure, known as \\emph{risk-preference}, is a subjective choice that is\ntightly related to psychology and behavioral science in decision making. This\npaper presents a novel approach of measuring risk preference from existing\nportfolios using inverse optimization on the mean-variance portfolio allocation\nframework.

To perform realistic nucleosynthesis calculations,\nunderstanding the uncertainty in microphysics details such as nuclear reaction\nrates is as essential as understanding uncertainties in modeling the\nastrophysical environment. We present an investigation of neutron capture rate\ncalculations' uncertainty away from stability using the Hauser-Feshbach model.\nWe provide a quantitative measure of the calculations' dependability when we\nextrapolate models of statistical properties to nuclei in an r-process network.\nWe select several level density and gamma-ray strength models appropriate for\nneutron-capture and use them to calculate the reaction rate for each nucleus in\nthe network. We observe how statistical properties affect the theoretical\nreaction rates. The rates are then sampled with the Monte Carlo technique and\nused in network calculations to map the range of possible r-process abundances.\nThe results show that neutron capture rates can vary by a couple of orders of\nmagnitude between calculations. Phenomenological models provide smoother\nresults than semi-microscopic. They cannot, however, reproduce nuclear\nstructure changes such as shell closures. While semi-microscopic models predict\nnuclear structure effects away from stability, it is not clear that these\nresults are quantitatively accurate.

Although our system is trained on simulated room impulse\nresponses (RIR) based on a fixed number of microphones arranged in a given\ngeometry, it generalizes well to a real array with the same geometry.\nState-of-the-art separation performance is obtained on the simulated two-talker\nSMS-WSJ corpus and the real-recorded LibriCSS dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 4 Oct 2020 22:13:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 May 2021 15:00:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-25"}

We assessed\nimprovements in original vs. motion corrected 3D DCE-US cine using: i)\nframe-to-frame volumetric overlap of segmented lesions, ii) normalized\ncorrelation coefficient (NCC) between frames (similarity analysis), and iii)\nsum of squared errors (SSE), root-mean-squared error (RMSE), and r-squared (R2)\nquality-of-fit from fitted time-intensity curves (TIC) extracted from a\nsegmented lesion. Overall, results demonstrate significant decreases in 3D\nDCE-US motion after applying the proposed algorithm. We noted significant\nimprovements in frame-to-frame lesion overlap across all patients, from 68%\nwithout correction to 83% with motion correction (p = 0.023). Frame-to-frame\nsimilarity as assessed by NCC also significantly improved on two different sets\nof time points from 0.694 (original cine) to 0.862 (corresponding MC cine) and\n0.723 to 0.886.

The first application of the volume\ndistribution algorithm is to determine the Lagrange multipliers in multiphase\nPhase-Field models that enforce the mass conservation, and a multiphase\nconservative Allen-Cahn model that satisfies the \\textit{consistency of\nreduction} is developed. A corresponding consistent and conservative numerical\nscheme is developed for the model. The multiphase conservative Allen-Cahn model\nhas a better ability than the multiphase Cahn-Hilliard model to preserve\nunder-resolved structures. The second application is to develop a numerical\nprocedure, called the boundedness mapping, to map the order parameters,\nobtained numerically from a multiphase model, into their physical interval, and\nat the same time to preserve the physical properties of the order parameters.\nAlong with the consistent and conservative schemes for the multiphase\nPhase-Field models, the numerical solutions of the order parameters are\nreduction consistent, conservative, and bounded, which are theoretically\nanalyzed and numerically validated.

This includes data\nfrom a representative automotive production GNSS used primarily for\nturn-by-turn navigation as well as an Inertial Navigation System (INS) which\ncouples two survey-grade GNSS receivers with a tactical grade Inertial\nMeasurement Unit (IMU) to act as ground truth. The latter utilized networked\nReal-Time Kinematic (RTK) GNSS corrections delivered over a cellular modem in\nreal-time. This dataset is being released into the public domain to spark\nfurther research in the community.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 2020 04:52:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-20"}

One of the most\nsuccessful variance-reduction techniques is path guiding, which can learn\nbetter distributions for importance sampling to reduce pixel noise. However,\nprevious methods require a large number of path samples to achieve reliable\npath guiding. We present a novel neural path guiding approach that can\nreconstruct high-quality sampling distributions for path guiding from a sparse\nset of samples, using an offline trained neural network. We leverage photons\ntraced from light sources as the input for sampling density reconstruction,\nwhich is highly effective for challenging scenes with strong global\nillumination. To fully make use of our deep neural network, we partition the\nscene space into an adaptive hierarchical grid, in which we apply our network\nto reconstruct high-quality sampling distributions for any local region in the\nscene. This allows for highly efficient path guiding for any path bounce at any\nlocation in path tracing. We demonstrate that our photon-driven neural path\nguiding method can generalize well on diverse challenging testing scenes that\nare not seen in training. Our approach achieves significantly better rendering\nresults of testing scenes than previous state-of-the-art path guiding methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 2020 04:54:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-06"}

SNNs distribute the analog values\nof pixel intensities into binary spikes over time. However, the most widely\nused input coding schemes, such as Poisson based rate-coding, do not leverage\nthe additional temporal learning capability of SNNs effectively. Moreover,\nthese SNNs suffer from high inference latency which is a major bottleneck to\ntheir deployment. To overcome this, we propose a scalable time-based encoding\nscheme that utilizes the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to reduce the number\nof timesteps required for inference. DCT decomposes an image into a weighted\nsum of sinusoidal basis images. At each time step, the Hadamard product of the\nDCT coefficients and a single frequency base, taken in order, is given to an\naccumulator that generates spikes upon crossing a threshold. We use the\nproposed scheme to learn DCT-SNN, a low-latency deep SNN with\nleaky-integrate-and-fire neurons, trained using surrogate gradient descent\nbased backpropagation. We achieve top-1 accuracy of 89.94%, 68.3% and 52.43% on\nCIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and TinyImageNet, respectively using VGG architectures.\nNotably, DCT-SNN performs inference with 2-14X reduced latency compared to\nother state-of-the-art SNNs, while achieving comparable accuracy to their\nstandard deep learning counterparts. The dimension of the transform allows us\nto control the number of timesteps required for inference. Additionally, we can\ntrade-off accuracy with latency in a principled manner by dropping the highest\nfrequency components during inference.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 2020 05:55:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-06"}

Learning deep neural networks using such\ndatasets leads to performances that are typically biased towards the majority\nclasses. Most of the prior works try to solve class-imbalance by assigning more\nweights to the minority classes in various manners (e.g., data re-sampling,\ncost-sensitive learning). However, we argue that the number of available\ntraining data may not be always a good clue to determine the weighting strategy\nbecause some of the minority classes might be sufficiently represented even by\na small number of training data. Overweighting samples of such classes can lead\nto drop in the model's overall performance. We claim that the 'difficulty' of a\nclass as perceived by the model is more important to determine the weighting.\nIn this light, we propose a novel loss function named Class-wise\nDifficulty-Balanced loss, or CDB loss, which dynamically distributes weights to\neach sample according to the difficulty of the class that the sample belongs\nto. Note that the assigned weights dynamically change as the 'difficulty' for\nthe model may change with the learning progress. Extensive experiments are\nconducted on both image (artificially induced class-imbalanced MNIST,\nlong-tailed CIFAR and ImageNet-LT) and video (EGTEA) datasets. The results show\nthat CDB loss consistently outperforms the recently proposed loss functions on\nclass-imbalanced datasets irrespective of the data type (i.e., video or image).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 2020 07:19:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-06"}

This problem arises in the Accelerated Cooling (ACC) process of\nproducing thermomechanically controlled processed (TMCP) heavy plates made of\nsteel. In order to adjust the complex microstructure of the underlying\nmaterial, the Leidenfrost behavior of the hot surfaces with respect to the\napplication of the cooling fluid has to be studied. Since the heat fluxes\ndepend on the enthalpy and hence on the solution of the underlying initial\nboundary value problem (IBVP), the parameter-to-solution operator, and thus the\nforward operator of the inverse problem, can only be defined implicitly. To\nguarantee well-defined operators, we study two approaches for showing existence\nand uniqueness of solutions of the IBVP. One approach deals with the theory of\npseudomonotone operators and so-called strong solutions in Sobolev-Bochner\nspaces. The other theory uses classical solutions in H\\\"older spaces. Whereas\nthe first approach yields a solution under milder assumptions, it fails to show\nthe uniqueness result in contrast to the second approach.

Quasi-normal modes are\nspecified by three integers $(\\ell,m,n)$: the $(\\ell, m)$ integers describe the\nangular properties and $(n)$ specifies the (over)tone.

To understand and\nprocess such phenomena, \"divide-and-conquer\" is probably the most common\nstrategy to address the problem. In other words, the captured signal is\ndecomposed into signal components for each individual component to be\nprocessed. Unfortunately, for signals that are superimposition of\nnon-stationary amplitude-frequency modulated (AM-FM) components, the\n\"divide-and-conquer\" strategy is bound to fail, since there is no way to be\nsure that the decomposed components take on the AM-FM formulations which are\nnecessary for the extraction of their instantaneous frequencies (IFs) and\namplitudes (IAs). In this paper, we propose an adaptive signal separation\noperation (ASSO) for effective and accurate separation of a single-channel\nblind-source multi-component signal, via introducing a time-varying parameter\nthat adapts locally to IFs and using linear chirp (linear frequency modulation)\nsignals to approximate components at each time instant. We derive more accurate\ncomponent recovery formulae based on the linear chirp signal local\napproximation. In addition, a recovery scheme, together with a ridge detection\nmethod, is also proposed to extract the signal components one by one, and the\ntime-varying parameter is updated for each component. The proposed method is\nsuitable for engineering implementation, being capable of separating\ncomplicated signals into their components or sub-signals and reconstructing the\nsignal trend directly. Numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world\nsignals are presented to demonstrate our improvement over the previous\nattempts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 2020 09:01:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 May 2022 19:18:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-30"}

The rapid airborne\ntransmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, and the absence of a vaccine, calls for active\ncontainment measures to avoid the propagation of transmission chains. The best\nstrategy up to date, popularly known as Test-Track-Treat (TTT), consist in\ntesting the population for diagnosis, track the contacts of those infected, and\ntreat by quarantine all these cases. The dynamical process that better\ndescribes the combined action of the former mechanisms is that of a contagion\nprocess that competes with the spread of the pathogen, cutting off potential\ncontagion pathways. Here we propose a compartmental model that couples the\ndynamics of the infection with the contact tracing and isolation of cases. We\ndevelop an analytical expression for the effective case reproduction number\n$R_c(t)$ that reveals the role of contact tracing in the mitigation and\nsuppression of the epidemics. We show that there is a trade off between the\ninfection propagation and the isolation of cases. If the isolation is limited\nto symptomatic individuals only, the incidence curve can be flattened but not\nbended. However, if contact tracing is applied to asymptomatic individuals too,\nthe strategy can bend the curve and suppress the epidemics. Quantitative\nresults are dependent on the network topology. We quantify, the most important\nindicator of the effectiveness of contact tracing, namely its capacity to\nreverse the increasing tendency of the epidemic curve, causing its bending.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 2020 09:02:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2021 23:21:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-24"}

One drawback of this approach,\nbesides the redundancy in estimating full 6 DOF camera poses, is the dependency\non estimating a map (3D scene points) jointly with the 6 DOF poses due to the\nbasic constraint on structure-and-motion.

Among them, some consider using pairwise but not pointwise labels,\nwhen pointwise labels are not accessible due to privacy, confidentiality, or\nsecurity reasons. However, as a pairwise label denotes whether or not two data\npoints share a pointwise label, it cannot be easily collected if either point\nis equally likely to be positive or negative. Thus, in this paper, we propose a\nnovel setting called pairwise comparison (Pcomp) classification, where we have\nonly pairs of unlabeled data that we know one is more likely to be positive\nthan the other. Firstly, we give a Pcomp data generation process, derive an\nunbiased risk estimator (URE) with theoretical guarantee, and further improve\nURE using correction functions. Secondly, we link Pcomp classification to\nnoisy-label learning to develop a progressive URE and improve it by imposing\nconsistency regularization. Finally, we demonstrate by experiments the\neffectiveness of our methods, which suggests Pcomp is a valuable and\npractically useful type of pairwise supervision besides the pairwise label.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 2020 09:23:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 1 Nov 2020 15:26:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 19 Jun 2021 15:08:45 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 13 Jan 2022 08:59:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-14"}

SEPs are correlated with the 11-year solar cycle while GCRs are\nanti-correlated due to their interaction with the heliospheric magnetic field\nand the solar wind. Our aim is to quantify separately the impact of the\namplitude and the geometry of the magnetic field on the propagation of CRs of\nvarious energies in the inner heliosphere. We focus especially on the diffusion\ncaused by the magnetic field along and across the field lines. To do so, we use\nthe results of 3D MHD wind simulations running from the lower corona up to 1\nAU. The wind is modeled using a polytropic approximation, and fits and power\nlaws are used to account for the turbulence. Using these results, we compute\nthe parallel and perpendicular diffusion coefficients of the Parker CR\ntransport equation, yielding 3D maps of the diffusion of CRs in the inner\nheliosphere. By varying the amplitude of the magnetic field, we change the\namplitude of the diffusion by the same factor, and the radial gradients by\nchanging the spread of the current sheet. By varying the geometry of the\nmagnetic field, we change the latitudinal gradients of diffusion by changing\nthe position of the current sheets. By varying the energy, we show that the\ndistribution of values for SEPs is more peaked than GCRs. For realistic solar\nconfigurations, we show that diffusion is highly non-axisymmetric due to the\nconfiguration of the current sheets, and that the distribution varies a lot\nwith the distance to the Sun with a drift of the peak value. This study shows\nthat numerical simulations and theory can help quantify better the influence of\nthe various magnetic field parameters on the propagation of CRs. This study is\na first step towards generating synthetic CR rates from numerical simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 2020 09:29:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-06"}

We compare the two\nbaselines with key configurations and find that: automatic Vietnamese word\nsegmentation improves the parsing results of both baselines; the normalized\npointwise mutual information (NPMI) score (Bouma, 2009) is useful for schema\nlinking; latent syntactic features extracted from a neural dependency parser\nfor Vietnamese also improve the results; and the monolingual language model\nPhoBERT for Vietnamese (Nguyen and Nguyen, 2020) helps produce higher\nperformances than the recent best multilingual language model XLM-R (Conneau et\nal., 2020).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 2020 09:54:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-06"}

We propose an\nefficient and cost-effective algorithm for tracking the scene and the patient\nto interactively assist the patient's positioning process by providing visual\nfeedback to the operator. Up to our knowledge, this is the first framework that\ncan be employed for mobile interactive AR to guide patient positioning.\nMETHODS: We propose a point cloud processing method that combined with a\nfiducial marker-mapper algorithm and the generalized ICP algorithm tracks the\npatient and the camera precisely and efficiently only using the CPU unit. The\nalignment between the 3D reference model and body marker map is calculated\nemploying an efficient body reconstruction algorithm.

Most\nprevious reasoning methods are designed for dense KGs with enough paths between\nentities, but cannot work well on those sparse KGs that only contain sparse\npaths for reasoning. On the one hand, sparse KGs contain less information,\nwhich makes it difficult for the model to choose correct paths. On the other\nhand, the lack of evidential paths to target entities also makes the reasoning\nprocess difficult. To solve these problems, we propose a multi-hop reasoning\nmodel named DacKGR over sparse KGs, by applying novel dynamic anticipation and\ncompletion strategies: (1) The anticipation strategy utilizes the latent\nprediction of embedding-based models to make our model perform more potential\npath search over sparse KGs.

To break these limits, we formulate this HG problem as\nfuture connectivity prediction task on a dynamic attributed graph via\npositive-unlabeled (PU) learning. Then, the key is to capture the temporal\nevolution of node pair (term pair) relations from just the positive and\nunlabeled data. We propose a variational inference model to estimate the\npositive prior, and incorporate it in the learning of node pair embeddings,\nwhich are then used for link prediction. Experiment results on real-world\nbiomedical term relationship datasets and case study analyses on a COVID-19\ndataset validate the effectiveness of the proposed model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 2020 10:58:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-06"}

We\ncalculate the equilibrium configurations at different temperatures and\ninteraction strengths and we simulate spin oscillations produced by a weak\nexternal perturbation. Despite some qualitative agreement, the comparison\nbetween the two theories shows that the mean-field approximation is not able to\nproperly describe the behavior of the two-dimensional mixture near the\nmiscible-immiscible transition, as thermal fluctuations smoothen all sharp\nfeatures both in the phase diagram and in spin dynamics, except for temperature\nwell below the critical temperature for superfluidity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 2020 11:46:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Feb 2021 16:16:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-19"}

To achieve our purpose, the\nground state phase diagrams are investigated. For the one-dimensional chain and\nsquare lattices, a first-order transition occurs between the superfluid phase\nand the solid phase and therefore there is no stable supersolid phase existing\nin these geometries.

The growth velocity, i.e., the rate of\nchange of the mean grain radius, is proportional to the local gas density if\nthe growth species (molecules) are well-mixed in the gas. As a consequence,\ngrain growth happens at vastly different rates in different locations, since\nthe gas-density distribution of the ISM shows a considerable variance. Here, it\nis shown that grain-size distribution (GSD) rapidly becomes a reflection of the\ngas-density distribution, irrespective of the shape of the initial GSD. This\nresult is obtained by modelling ISM turbulence as a Markov process, which in\nthe special case of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process leads to a lognormal\ngas-density distribution, consistent with numerical simulations of isothermal\ncompressible turbulence. This yields an approximately lognormal GSD; the sizes\nof dust grains in cold ISM clouds may thus not follow the commonly adopted\npower-law GSD with index -3.5, but corroborates the use of a log-nomral GSD for\nlarge grains, suggested by several studies. It is also concluded that the very\nwide range of gas densities obtained in the high Mach-number turbulence of\nmolecular clouds must allow formation of a tail of very large grains reaching\nradii of several microns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 2020 12:45:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-09"}

Existing methods fall short in unveiling human\nmovement regularities, because they either do not model the text data at all or\nsuffer from text sparsity severely. We propose SHMM, a multi-modal spherical\nhidden Markov model for semantics-rich human mobility modeling. Under the\nhidden Markov assumption, SHMM models the generation process of a given trace\nby jointly considering the observed location, time, and text at each step of\nthe trace. The distinguishing characteristic of SHMM is the text modeling part.\nWe use fixed-size vector representations to encode the semantics of the text\nmessages, and model the generation of the l2-normalized text embeddings on a\nunit sphere with the von Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution. Compared with other\nalternatives like multi-variate Gaussian, our choice of the vMF distribution\nnot only incurs much fewer parameters, but also better leverages the\ndiscriminative power of text embeddings in a directional metric space. The\nparameter inference for the vMF distribution is non-trivial since it involves\nfunctional inversion of ratios of Bessel functions. We theoretically prove\nthat: 1) the classical Expectation-Maximization algorithm can work with vMF\ndistributions; and 2) while closed-form solutions are hard to be obtained for\nthe M-step, Newton's method is guaranteed to converge to the optimal solution\nwith quadratic convergence rate. We have performed extensive experiments on\nboth synthetic and real-life data. The results on synthetic data verify our\ntheoretical analysis; while the results on real-life data demonstrate that SHMM\nlearns meaningful semantics-rich mobility models, outperforms state-of-the-art\nmobility models for next location prediction, and incurs lower training cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 2020 13:18:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-06"}

First, we establish that the otherwise\nathermal granular pile during tapping exhibits annealing behavior comparable to\nglassy polymer or colloidal systems. Like those other systems, the pile\nundergoes a glass transition and \"freezes\" into different non-equilibrium\nglassy states at low agitation for different annealing speeds, starting from\nthe same initial equilibrium state at high agitation. Then, we quench the\nsystem instantaneously from the highly-agitated state to below the glass\ntransition regime to study the ensuing aging dynamics. In this classical aging\nprotocol, the density increases (i.e., the potential energy of the pile\ndecreases) logarithmically over several decades in time. Instead of\nsystem-wide, thermodynamic measures, here we identify the intermittent,\nirreversible events (\"quakes\") that actually drive the glassy relaxation\nprocess. We find that the event rate decelerates hyperbolically, which explains\nthe observed increase in density when the integrated contribution to the\ndownward displacements is evaluated.

Such properties address aspects such as costs and rewards,\nquality measures, resource consumption, distance metrics, etc.\n  Existing solutions for problems in quantitative analysis face two challenges,\nnamely lack of generalizability and separation-of-techniques. Lack of\ngeneralizability refers to the issue that solution approaches are specialized\nto cost model. Different cost models deploy such disparate algorithms that\nthere is no transfer of knowledge from one cost model to another.\nSeparation-of-techniques refers to the inherent dichotomy in solving problems\nin quantitative analysis. Most algorithms comprise of a structural phase which\nreasons about the structure of the quantitative system(s) using techniques from\nautomata or graphs, and a numerical phase, which reasons about the quantitative\ndimension/cost model using numerical methods. The techniques used in both\nphases are so unlike each other that they are difficult to combine, thereby\nimpacting scalability.\n  This thesis contributes to a novel framework that addresses these challenges.\nThe introduced framework, called comparator automata or comparators in short,\nbuilds on automata-theoretic foundations to generalize across a variety of cost\nmodels. Comparators enable automata-based methods in the numerical phase, hence\neradicating the dependence on numerical methods.

Matrix profile has low\narithmetic intensity, but it typically operates on large amounts of time series\ndata. In current computing systems, this data needs to be moved between the\noff-chip memory units and the on-chip computation units for performing matrix\nprofile.

It has become a serious problem around the world. We present a\nnew system, FaNDS, that detects fake news efficiently. The system is based on\nseveral concepts used in some previous works but in a different context. There\nare two main concepts: an Inconsistency Graph and Energy Flow. The\nInconsistency Graph contains news items as nodes and inconsistent opinions\nbetween them for edges. Energy Flow assigns each node an initial energy and\nthen some energy is propagated along the edges until the energy distribution on\nall nodes converges. To illustrate FaNDS we use the original data from the Fake\nNews Challenge (FNC-1). First, the data has to be reconstructed in order to\ngenerate the Inconsistency Graph. The graph contains various subgraphs with\nwell-defined shapes that represent different types of connections between the\nnews items. Then the Energy Flow method is applied. The nodes with high energy\nare the candidates for being fake news. In our experiments, all these were\nindeed fake news as we checked each using several reliable web sites. We\ncompared FaNDS to several other fake news detection methods and found it to be\nmore sensitive in discovering fake news items.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 2020 15:34:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-06"}

In contrast,\nactive Brownian particles exhibit steady-state phenomena that depend on both\nthe strength and the polarity of the applied magnetic field. The intriguing\neffects of the Lorentz force, however, can only be observed when\nout-of-equilibrium density gradients are maintained in the system. To this end,\nwe use the method of stochastic resetting on active Brownian particles in two\ndimensions by resetting them to the line $x=0$ at a constant rate and\nperiodicity in the $y$ direction. Under stochastic resetting, an active system\nsettles into a nontrivial stationary state which is characterized by an\ninhomogeneous density distribution, polarization and bulk fluxes perpendicular\nto the density gradients. We show that whereas for a uniform magnetic field the\nproperties of the stationary state of the active system can be obtained from\nits passive counterpart, novel features emerge in the case of an inhomogeneous\nmagnetic field which have no counterpart in passive systems. In particular,\nthere exists an activity-dependent threshold rate such that for smaller\nresetting rates, the density distribution of active particles becomes\nnon-monotonic. We also study the mean first-passage time to the $x$ axis and\nfind a surprising result: it takes an active particle more time to reach the\ntarget from any given point for the case when the magnetic field increases away\nfrom the axis.

Importantly, edits that are not necessary to\nflip the applicable label are prohibited. Models trained on the augmented data\nappear, empirically, to rely less on semantically irrelevant words and to\ngeneralize better out of domain. While this work draws loosely on causal\nthinking, the underlying causal model (even at an abstract level) and the\nprinciples underlying the observed out-of-domain improvements remain unclear.\nIn this paper, we introduce a toy analog based on linear Gaussian models,\nobserving interesting relationships between causal models, measurement noise,\nout-of-domain generalization, and reliance on spurious signals. Our analysis\nprovides some insights that help to explain the efficacy of CAD. Moreover, we\ndevelop the hypothesis that while adding noise to causal features should\ndegrade both in-domain and out-of-domain performance, adding noise to\nnon-causal features should lead to relative improvements in out-of-domain\nperformance. This idea inspires a speculative test for determining whether a\nfeature attribution technique has identified the causal spans. If adding noise\n(e.g., by random word flips) to the highlighted spans degrades both in-domain\nand out-of-domain performance on a battery of challenge datasets, but adding\nnoise to the complement gives improvements out-of-domain, it suggests we have\nidentified causal spans. We present a large-scale empirical study comparing\nspans edited to create CAD to those selected by attention and saliency maps.\nAcross numerous domains and models, we find that the hypothesized phenomenon is\npronounced for CAD.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 2020 15:57:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2020 02:21:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 23 Mar 2021 02:02:40 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 24 Mar 2021 01:46:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-25"}

We demonstrate with the example\nof ischemic stroke that an improvement in lesion segmentation is feasible using\ndeep learning based augmentation. To this end, we train different\nimage-to-image translation models to synthesize magnetic resonance images of\nbrain volumes with and without stroke lesions from semantic segmentation maps.\nIn addition, we train a generative adversarial network to generate synthetic\nlesion masks. Subsequently, we combine these two components to build a large\ndatabase of synthetic stroke images. The performance of the various models is\nevaluated using a U-Net which is trained to segment stroke lesions on a\nclinical test set. We report a Dice score of $\\mathbf{72.8}$%\n[$\\mathbf{70.8\\pm1.0}$%] for the model with the best performance, which\noutperforms the model trained on the clinical images alone $\\mathbf{67.3}$%\n[$\\mathbf{63.2\\pm1.9}$%], and is close to the human inter-reader Dice score of\n$\\mathbf{76.9}$%. Moreover, we show that for a small database of only 10 or 50\nclinical cases, synthetic data augmentation yields significant improvement\ncompared to a setting where no synthetic data is used. To the best of our\nknowledge, this presents the first comparative analysis of synthetic data\naugmentation based on image-to-image translation, and first application to\nischemic stroke.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 2020 09:12:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 31 Oct 2021 21:35:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-02"}

Presently, stress cannot easily be measured by surgeons in the\noperating room. Instead, surgeons rely on intuition and experience. Predictive\ncomputational tools are ideal candidates for surgery planning. Finite element\n(FE) simulations have shown promise in predicting stress fields on large skin\npatches and complex cases, helping to identify potential regions of\ncomplication. Unfortunately, these simulations are computationally expensive\nand deterministic. However, running a few, well-selected FE simulations allows\nus to create Gaussian process (GP) surrogate models of local cutaneous flaps\nthat are computationally efficient and able to predict stress and strain for\narbitrary material parameters. Here, we create GP surrogates for the\nadvancement, rotation, and transposition flaps. We then use the predictive\ncapability of these surrogates to perform a global sensitivity analysis,\nultimately showing that fiber direction has the most significant impact on\nstrain field variations. We then perform an optimization to determine the\noptimal fiber direction for each flap for three different objectives driven by\nclinical guidelines. While material properties are not controlled by the\nsurgeon and are actually a source of uncertainty, the surgeon can in fact\ncontrol the orientation of the flap. Therefore, fiber direction is the only\nmaterial parameter that can be optimized clinically. The optimization task\nrelies on the efficiency of the GP surrogates to calculate the expected cost of\ndifferent strategies when the uncertainty of other material parameters is\nincluded. We propose optimal flap orientations for the three cost functions and\nthat can help in reducing stress resulting from the surgery and ultimately\nreduce complications associated with excessive mechanical loading near wounds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 2020 11:44:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-07"}

Our\nmain contributions are 1.) comparing how the log-likelihood affects the\nangle-difference in the real projection matrix, and the found matrix matrix,\n2.) an extensive analysis of current popular methods including strengths and\nshortcomings, 3.) a short analysis on how dimensionality reduction techniques\ncan be used for feature selection, and 4.) a novel algorithm called \"BORING\",\nwhich allows for a simple fallback mechanism if the matrix identification\nfails, as well as taking into consideration \"passive\" subspaces which provide\nsmall perturbations of the function at hand. The main features of BORING are\n1.) the possibility to identify the subspace (unlike most other optimization\nalgorithms), and 2.) to provide a much lower penalty to identify the subspace\nif identification fails, as optimization is still the primary goal.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 2020 13:13:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-09"}

One area that will greatly benefit from this\ncross-pollination is the problem of biological sequence design, which has\nmassive potential for therapeutic applications. However, significant\ninefficiencies remain in communication between these fields which result in\nbiologists finding the progress in machine learning inaccessible, and hinder\nmachine learning scientists from contributing to impactful problems in\nbioengineering. Sequence design can be seen as a search process on a discrete,\nhigh-dimensional space, where each sequence is associated with a function. This\nsequence-to-function map is known as a \"Fitness Landscape\". Designing a\nsequence with a particular function is hence a matter of \"discovering\" such a\n(often rare) sequence within this space. Today we can build predictive models\nwith good interpolation ability due to impressive progress in the synthesis and\ntesting of biological sequences in large numbers, which enables model training\nand validation.
