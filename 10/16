Most of the existing adversarial attack methods only create a\nsingle adversarial example for the input, which just gives a glimpse of the\nunderlying data manifold of adversarial examples. An attractive solution is to\nexplore the solution space of the adversarial examples and generate a diverse\nbunch of them, which could potentially improve the robustness of real-world\nsystems and help prevent severe security threats and vulnerabilities. In this\npaper, we present an effective method, called Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with\nAccumulated Momentum (HMCAM), aiming to generate a sequence of adversarial\nexamples. To improve the efficiency of HMC, we propose a new regime to\nautomatically control the length of trajectories, which allows the algorithm to\nmove with adaptive step sizes along the search direction at different\npositions.

We study when and how the arch transitions between\nstates and show that the end-shortening at which the fast 'snap' happens\ndepends on the rate at which the end-shortening is reduced. This lag in\nsnap-through is a consequence of delayed bifurcation and occurs even in the\nperfectly elastic case when viscous (and viscoelastic) effects are negligible.\nWe present the results of numerical simulations to determine the magnitude of\nthis lag as the loading rate and the importance of external viscous damping\nvary.

It is\nindeed a Lagrangian invariant in inviscid classical fluids. In quantum flows,\ncirculation is quantized, taking discrete values that are directly related to\nthe number and the orientation of thin vortex filaments enclosed by the path.\nBy varying the size of such closed loop, the circulation provides a measure of\nthe dependence of the flow structure on the considered scale. Here we consider\nthe scale dependence of circulation statistics in quantum turbulence, using\nhigh resolution direct numerical simulations of a generalized Gross-Pitaevskii\nmodel. Results are compared to the circulation statistics obtained from\nsimulations of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. When the integration\npath is smaller than the mean inter-vortex distance, the statistics of\ncirculation in quantum turbulence displays extreme intermittent behavior due to\nthe quantization of circulation, in stark contrast with the viscous scales of\nclassical flows. In contrast, at larger scales, circulation moments display\nstriking similarities with the statistics probed in the inertial range of\nclassical turbulence. This includes the emergence of the power law scalings\npredicted from Kolmogorov's 1941 theory, as well as intermittency deviations\nthat closely follow the recently proposed bifractal model for circulation\nmoments in classical flows. To date, this is the most convincing evidence of\nintermittency in the large scales of quantum turbulence.

After general properties\nof the Hawking energy along slices of the past lightcone have previously been\nstudied, the present work continues along this path by providing explicit\ncosmological applications of the Hawking energy associated with a lightcone.\nFirstly, it is shown that amongst all two-dimensional non-trapped spheres with\nequal area and average matter density, a shear-free matter distribution\nmaximizes the Hawking energy for sufficiently high densities. Secondly, a\nRobertson-Walker reference slice is constructed for every lightcone slice based\non area and energy.

This can be challenging if there are gross differences\nin image geometry or in signal intensity, such as in the case of some molecular\nPET radioligands, where control subjects display relative lack of signal\nrelative to noise within intracranial regions, and may have off target binding\nthat may be confused as other regions, and may vary depending on subject. The\nuse of intermediary images or volumes have been shown to aide registration in\nsuch cases.\n  To account for this phenomena within our own longitudinal aging cohort, we\ngenerated a population specific MRI and PET template from a broad distribution\nof 30 amyloid negative subjects. We then registered the PET image of each of\nthese subjects, as well as a holdout set of thirty 'template-naive' subjects to\ntheir corresponding MRI images using the template image as an intermediate\nusing three different sets of registration parameters and procedures. To\nevaluate the performance of both conventional registration and our method, we\ncompared these to the registration of the attenuation CT (acquired at time of\nPET acquisition) to MRI as the reference. We then used our template to directly\nderive SUVR values without the use of MRI.\n  We found that conventional registration was comparable to an existing CT\nbased standard, and there was no significant difference in errors collectively\namongst all methods tested. In addition, there were no significant differences\nbetween existing and MR-less tau PET quantification methods. We conclude that a\ntemplate-based method is a feasible alternative to, or salvage for, direct\nregistration and MR-less quantification; and, may be preferred in cases where\nthere is doubt about the similarity between two image modalities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Oct 2020 17:21:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-16"}

By relaxing the set of\noperations allowed from LOCC to those that completely preserve the positivity\nof the partial transpose, we obtain semi-definite programming lower bounds on\nthe simulation error of unideal bidirectional teleportation. We evaluate these\nbounds for several key examples: when there is no resource state at all and for\nisotropic and Werner states, in each case finding an analytical solution. The\nfirst aforementioned example establishes a benchmark for classical versus\nquantum bidirectional teleportation. Another example consists of a resource\nstate resulting from the action of a generalized amplitude damping channel on\ntwo Bell states, for which we find an analytical expression for the simulation\nerror.

In this work, we consider the setting where the two parties (a\nclassical Alice and a quantum Bob) can communicate only via a classical\nchannel. Our first result shows that it is in general impossible to realize a\ntwo-party quantum functionality with black-box simulation in the case of\nmalicious quantum adversaries. In particular, we show that the existence of a\nsecure quantum computing protocol that relies only on classical channels would\ncontradict the quantum no-cloning argument.\n  We circumvent this impossibility following three different approaches.

A well-motivated example is from a pure Yang-Mills hidden\nsector, which locks up into glueballs in the early universe. The lightest\nglueball states are scalar particles and can act as a form of bosonic dark\nmatter. If self-interactions are repulsive this can potentially lead to very\nmassive boson stars, where the inward gravitational force is balanced by the\nrepulsive self-interaction. This can also arise from elementary real scalars\nwith a regular potential. In the literature it has been claimed that this\nallows for astrophysically significant boson stars with high compactness, which\ncould undergo binary mergers and generate detectable gravitational waves. Here\nwe show that previous analyses did not take into proper account $3 \\to 2$ and\n$4 \\to 2$ quantum mechanical annihilation processes in the core of the star,\nwhile other work misinterpreted the classical $3 \\to 1$ process. In this work,\nwe compute the annihilation rates, finding that massive stars will rapidly\ndecay from the $3 \\to 2$ or $4 \\to 2$ processes (while the $3 \\to 1$ process is\ntypically small). Using the Einstein-Klein-Gordon equations, we also estimate\nthe binding energy of these stars, showing that even the densest stars do not\nhave quite enough binding energy to prevent annihilations. For such boson stars\nto live for the current age of the universe and to be consistent with bounds on\ndark matter scattering in galaxies, we find the following upper bound on their\nmass for $O(1)$ self-interaction couplings: $M_*<10^{-18}M_{sun}$ when $3 \\to\n2$ processes are allowed and $M_*<10^{-11}M_{sun}$ when only $4 \\to 2$\nprocesses are allowed. We also estimate destabilization from parametric\nresonance which can considerably constrain the phase space further.\nFurthermore, such stars are required to have very small compactness to be long\nlived.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Oct 2020 17:56:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 18 Oct 2020 21:01:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 19 Nov 2020 17:30:52 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 11 Dec 2020 01:08:12 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sat, 19 Dec 2020 02:02:18 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2021 00:33:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-29"}

The\nconventional approach of using the observed surface densities to infer star\nformation laws has however revealed a major and well-known issue, as such\nrelations are valid for the high-density regions of galaxies but break down in\nlow-density and HI-dominated environments. Recently, an empirical correlation\nbetween the total gas (HI+H$_2$) and the star formation rate (SFR) volume\ndensities was obtained for a sample of nearby disc galaxies and for the Milky\nWay. This volumetric star formation (VSF) law is a single power-law with no\nbreak and a smaller intrinsic scatter with respect to the star formation laws\nbased on the surface density. In this work, we explore the VSF law in the\nregime of dwarf galaxies in order to test its validity in HI-dominated,\nlow-density, and low-metallicity environments. In addition, we assess this\nrelation in the outskirts of spiral galaxies, which are low-density and\nHI-dominated regions similar to dwarf galaxies.

Radial transport of planets can slow down\nsignificantly once deep gaps are carved out by their interaction with disk gas.\nDisks are more easily perturbed closer to the star, so accounting for gap\nopening flattens the final orbital period distribution. To recover the observed\nrise in occurrence rate, gas giants need to be more massive farther out, which\nis naturally achieved if their envelopes are dust-free. The range of mass\ngradients we find to reconcile the observed occurrence rate of Jupiters is too\nabrupt to account for the mass-period distribution of low-eccentricity giant\nplanets, challenging disk migration as the dominant origin channel of hot and\nwarm Jupiters. Future efforts in characterizing the unbiased mass distribution\nwill place stronger constraints on predictions from migration theory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Oct 2020 18:00:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-09"}

In this note, we explain the structure of operators\nlocalized at the edge of the droplet, where the density drops to zero. We list\nall operators contributing to the ground-state energy with nonnegative powers\nof Q in the large-Q expansion. As a test, we use dimensional regularization to\nreproduce the calculation of the NLO ground state energy by Kravec and Pal ,\nand we recover the same universal coefficient for the logarithmic term as in\nthat work.

These\nprotocols aim at efficiently estimating the quality of a set of quantum gates\nin a way that is resistant to state preparation and measurement errors. Over\nthe years many versions have been developed, however, a comprehensive\ntheoretical treatment of RB has been missing. In this work, we develop a\nrigorous framework of RB general enough to encompass virtually all known\nprotocols as well as novel, more flexible extensions. Overcoming previous\nlimitations on error models and gate sets, this framework allows us, for the\nfirst time, to formulate realistic conditions under which we can rigorously\nguarantee that the output of any RB experiment is well-described by a linear\ncombination of matrix exponential decays. We complement this with a detailed\nanalysis of the fitting problem associated with RB data. We introduce modern\nsignal processing techniques to RB, prove analytical sample complexity bounds,\nand numerically evaluate performance and limitations. In order to reduce the\nresource demands of this fitting problem, we introduce novel, scalable\npost-processing techniques to isolate exponential decays, significantly\nimproving the practical feasibility of a large set of RB protocols. These\npost-processing techniques overcome shortcomings in efficiency of several\npreviously proposed methods such as character benchmarking and linear-cross\nentropy benchmarking. Finally, we discuss, in full generality, how and when RB\ndecay rates can be used to infer quality measures like the average fidelity.

However, the extent to which\nblack-box commercial face recognition algorithms (CFRAs) use gender and race\nfeatures to determine identity is poorly understood despite increasing\ndeployments by government and industry. In this study, we quantified the degree\nto which gender and race features influenced face recognition similarity scores\nbetween different people, i.e. non-mated scores. We ran this study using five\ndifferent CFRAs and a sample of 333 diverse test subjects. As a control, we\ncompared the behavior of these non-mated distributions to a commercial iris\nrecognition algorithm (CIRA). Confirming prior work, all CFRAs produced higher\nsimilarity scores for people of the same gender and race, an effect known as\n\"broad homogeneity\". No such effect was observed for the CIRA. Next, we applied\nprincipal components analysis (PCA) to similarity score matrices. We show that\nsome principal components (PCs) of CFRAs cluster people by gender and race, but\nthe majority do not. Demographic clustering in the PCs accounted for only 10 %\nof the total CFRA score variance. No clustering was observed for the CIRA. This\ndemonstrates that, although CFRAs use some gender and race features to\nestablish identity, most features utilized by current CFRAs are unrelated to\ngender and race, similar to the iris texture patterns utilized by the CIRA.\nFinally, reconstruction of similarity score matrices using only PCs that showed\nno demographic clustering reduced broad homogeneity effects, but also decreased\nthe separation between mated and non-mated scores. This suggests it's possible\nfor CFRAs to operate on features unrelated to gender and race, albeit with\nsomewhat lower recognition accuracy, but that this is not the current\ncommercial practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Oct 2020 18:52:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-19"}

In this work,\nwe use a thermochemical code to focus on the chemical evolution that is\noccurring within the gas-depleted gap and the dust-rich ring often observed\nbehind it. The composition of these spatial locations are of great import, as\nthe gas and ice-coated grains will end up being part of the atmospheres of gas\ngiants and/or the seeds of rocky planets. Our models show that the dust\ntemperature at the midplane of the gap increases, enough to produce local\nsublimation of key volatiles and pushing the molecular layer closer to the\nmidplane, while it decreases in the dust-rich ring, causing a higher volatile\ndeposition onto the dust grain surfaces. Further, the ring itself presents a\nfreeze-out trap for volatiles in local flows powered by forming planets,\nbecoming a site of localized volatile enhancement. Within the gas depleted gap,\nthe line emission depends on several different parameters, such as: the depth\nof the gap in surface density, the location of the dust substructure, and the\nabundance of common gas tracers, such as CO.

Even\nwhen the true posterior is not Gaussian (e.g., in the case of nonlinear\nmeasurement functions) we can use variational schemes that repeatedly solve\nthis linear algebra problem at each iteration. In most cases, the question is\nnot whether a solution to this problem exists, but rather how we can exploit\nproblem-specific structure to find it efficiently. Our contribution is to\nclearly state the Fundamental Linear Algebra Problem of Gaussian Inference\n(FLAPOGI) and to provide a novel presentation (using Kronecker algebra) of the\nnot-so-well-known result of Takahashi et al.

We first provide a global\nsolution and then a local version that can be implemented using local message\npassing amongst a collection of agents calculating in parallel. Contrary to\nbelief propagation, our local scheme is guaranteed to converge in both the mean\nand desired covariance quantities to the global solution even when the\nunderlying factor graph is loopy; in the case of synchronous updates, we\nprovide a bound on the number of iterations required for convergence. Compared\nto belief propagation, this guaranteed convergence comes at the cost of\nadditional storage, calculations, and communication links in the case of loops;\nhowever, we show how these can be automatically constructed on the fly using\nonly local information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Oct 2020 21:09:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-19"}

However, each individual agent\nsimultaneously seeks to act to secure a larger chunk than its co-workers of the\nannual increment in compensation, which usually comes from a {\\em fixed} pot.\nAs such, the individual agent in the organization must cooperate and compete.\nAnother feature of many organizations is that a worker receives a bonus, which\nis often a fraction of previous year's total profit. As such, the agent derives\na reward that is also partly dependent on historical performance. How should\nthe individual agent decide to act in this context? Few methods for the mixed\ncooperative-competitive setting have been presented in recent years, but these\nare challenged by problem domains whose reward functions do not depend on the\ncurrent state and action only. Recent deep multi-agent reinforcement learning\n(MARL) methods using long short-term memory (LSTM) may be used, but these adopt\na joint perspective to the interaction or require explicit exchange of\ninformation among the agents to promote cooperation, which may not be possible\nunder competition.

Recent studies demonstrate that\nlayer-wise learning can achieve state-of-the-art performance in image\nclassification on various datasets. However, previous studies of layer-wise\nlearning are limited to networks with simple hierarchical structures, and the\nperformance decreases severely for deeper networks like ResNet. This paper, for\nthe first time, reveals the fundamental reason that impedes the scale-up of\nlayer-wise learning is due to the relatively poor separability of the feature\nspace in shallow layers. This argument is empirically verified by controlling\nthe intensity of the convolution operation in local layers. We discover that\nthe poorly-separable features from shallow layers are mismatched with the\nstrong supervision constraint throughout the entire network, making the\nlayer-wise learning sensitive to network depth. The paper further proposes a\ndownsampling acceleration approach to weaken the poor learning of shallow\nlayers so as to transfer the learning emphasis to deep feature space where the\nseparability matches better with the supervision restraint.

Thus, an $n$-sample in a space $M$ can\nbe considered as an element of the quotient space of $M^n$ modulo the\npermutation group. The present paper takes this definition of sample space and\nthe related concept of orbit types as a starting point for developing a\ngeometric perspective on statistics. We aim at deriving a general mathematical\nsetting for studying the behavior of empirical and population means in spaces\nranging from smooth Riemannian manifolds to general stratified spaces. We fully\ndescribe the orbifold and path-metric structure of the sample space when $M$ is\na manifold or path-metric space, respectively. These results are non-trivial\neven when $M$ is Euclidean.

In order to\ncreate an efficient observing strategy for their observing method it is crucial\nto know their intrinsic rate. Unfortunately, the numerous models existing today\npredict this rate on a vary wide range. Hence, our goal in this paper is to\ninvestigate the effect of different level of approximations on the relative\nrate predictions. Also, we study the effect of distinct ejecta mass lay-outs on\nthe light curve.

This means that different\nejecta layouts can produce light curves with similar shapes making it a\nchallenging task to infer the structure of the matter outflow. Thus, we\nconclude that the uncertainty in the rate predictions arising from the various\nejecta mass distribution models is negligible compared to the errors present in\nother input parameters (e.g. binary neutron star merger rate).

To the best of our knowledge, EgoK360 is the first\ndataset in the domain of first-person activity recognition with a 360{\\deg}\nenvironmental setup, which will facilitate the egocentric 360 {\\deg} video\nunderstanding. We provide experimental results and comprehensive analysis of\nvariants of the two-stream network for 360 egocentric activity recognition. The\nEgoK360 dataset can be downloaded from https://egok360.github.io/.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Oct 2020 22:40:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-19"}

Analogous to natural\nlanguage, music can be modeled as a sequence of tokens. This motivates the\nmajority of existing solutions to explore the utilization of word embedding\nmodels to build music embeddings. However, music differs from natural languages\nin two key aspects: (1) musical token is multi-faceted -- it comprises of\npitch, rhythm and dynamics information; and (2) musical context is\ntwo-dimensional -- each musical token is dependent on both melodic and harmonic\ncontexts. In this work, we provide a comprehensive solution by proposing a\nnovel framework named PiRhDy that integrates pitch, rhythm, and dynamics\ninformation seamlessly. PiRhDy adopts a hierarchical strategy which can be\ndecomposed into two steps: (1) token (i.e., note event) modeling, which\nseparately represents pitch, rhythm, and dynamics and integrates them into a\nsingle token embedding; and (2) context modeling, which utilizes melodic and\nharmonic knowledge to train the token embedding. A thorough study was made on\neach component and sub-strategy of PiRhDy. We further validate our embeddings\nin three downstream tasks -- melody completion, accompaniment suggestion, and\ngenre classification. Results indicate a significant advancement of the neural\napproach towards symbolic music as well as PiRhDy's potential as a pretrained\ntool for a broad range of symbolic music applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Oct 2020 01:25:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-19"}

However, it has been challenging to explain the unique properties of the\nscatterings observed for the $4^+_1$ state through reaction calculations.\nPurpose: To investigate the structure and transition properties of the K=0+ and\nK=2+ bands of 24Mg employing the microscopic structure and reaction\ncalculations via inelastic proton and alpha-scattering. Particularly, the E4\ntransitions to the $4^+_1$ and $4^+_2$ states were reexamined. Method: The\nstructure of 24Mg was calculated employing the variation after the parity and\ntotal-angular momentum projections in the framework of the antisymmetrized\nmolecular dynamics(AMD). The inelastic proton and alpha reactions were\ncalculated by the microscopic coupled-channel (MCC) approach by folding the\nMelbourne g-matrix NN interaction with the AMD densities of 24Mg. Results:\nReasonable results were obtained on the properties of the structure, including\nthe energy spectra and E2 and E4 transitions of the K=0+ and K=2+ bands owing\nto the enhanced collectivity of triaxial deformation. The MCC+AMD calculation\nsuccessfully reproduced the angular distributions of the $4^+_1$ and $4^+_2$\ncross sections of proton scattering at incident energies of $E_p$=40--100MeV\nand alpha-scattering at $E_\\alpha$=100--400MeV. Conclusions: This is the first\nmicroscopic calculation that described the unique properties of the $0^+_1\\to\n4^+_1$ transition. In the inelastic scattering to the $4^+_1$ state, the\ndominant two-step process of the $0^+_1\\to 2^+_1\\to 4^+_1$ transitions and the\ndeconstructive interference is the weak one-step process were essential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Oct 2020 04:08:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-19"}

Many nanoscopic\nunderstandings, including changes in in-pore ion concentration and mobility\nduring dynamical processes, are continuously reported. However, quantitative\nscale-up of these nanoscopic understandings for evaluation of the macroscopic\nperformance of supercapacitors is difficult due to the absence of links between\nthese scales. Here we demonstrate that machine learning can be used to\nestablish such links. Starting from nanoscale, we first reveal a\ndiffusion-enhanced migration of ions in nanopores using primarily modified\nPoisson-Nernst-Planck model, unlike in bulk electrolyte where diffusion\ncounteracts migration. Using machine learning, we discover a dynamically\nvarying ionic resistance and its equation, resulting from the in-pore ion\nconcentration change contributed by diffusion-enhanced migration. The obtained\nequation is used to construct a nano-circuitry model (NCM), which describes\nboth the macroscopic performance of supercapacitors and nanometre-resolved\nionic behaviour. We demonstrate that NCM can provide additional perspectives to\nunderstand cyclic voltammograms. A Faradaic-like current peak can show in\nnon-Faradaic processes, and an asymmetric charging/discharging can occur\nwithout ion desolvation. These is because the dynamically varying resistance\ndelivers ions effectively for storage. The demonstrated use of machine learning\ncould extend to other ionic systems including batteries and desalination,\npaving the route towards rational design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Oct 2020 04:13:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-19"}

To alleviate the risk of causing damage through unexpected\nintensive physical contacts, we present the contact-safe MBRL that associates\nthe probabilistic Model Predictive Control's (pMPC) control limits with the\nmodel uncertainty so that the allowed acceleration of controlled behavior is\nadjusted according to learning progress. Control planning with such\nuncertainty-aware control limits is formulated as a deterministic MPC problem\nusing a computation-efficient approximated GP dynamics and an approximated\ninference technique. Our approach's effectiveness is evaluated through bowl\nmixing tasks with simulated and real robots, scooping tasks with a real robot\nas examples of contact-rich manipulation skills.

Different from the\nstate of the art, which traditionally focuses on univariate measurements,\nNet-GAN detects anomalies in multivariate time-series, exploiting temporal\ndependencies through RNNs. Net-GAN discovers the underlying distribution of the\nbaseline, multivariate data, without making any assumptions on its nature,\noffering a powerful approach to detect anomalies in complex, difficult to model\nnetwork monitoring data. We further exploit the concepts behind generative\nmodels to conceive Net-VAE, a complementary approach to Net-GAN for network\nanomaly detection, based on variational auto-encoders (VAE). We evaluate\nNet-GAN and Net-VAE in different monitoring scenarios, including anomaly\ndetection in IoT sensor data, and intrusion detection in network measurements.\nGenerative models represent a promising approach for network anomaly detection,\nespecially when considering the complexity and ever-growing number of\ntime-series to monitor in operational networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Oct 2020 10:22:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-19"}

We\nfocus on learning-enabled state estimation systems (LE-SESs), which have been\nwidely used in robotics applications to determine the current state (e.g.,\nlocation, speed, direction, etc.) of a complex system. The LE-SESs are\nnetworked systems composed of a set of connected components including Bayes\nfilters for localisation, and neural networks for processing sensory input. We\nstudy LE-SESs from the perspective of formal verification, which determines the\nsatisfiability of a system model against the specified properties. Over\nLE-SESs, we investigate two key properties - robustness and resilience - and\nprovide their formal definitions. To enable formal verification, we reduce the\nLE-SESs to a novel class of labelled transition systems, named {PO}2-LTS in the\npaper, and formally express the properties as constrained optimisation\nobjectives. We prove that the robustness verification is NP-complete. Based on\n{PO}2-LTS and the optimisation objectives, practical verification algorithms\nare developed to check the satisfiability of the properties on the LE-SESs. As\na major case study, we interrogate a real-world dynamic tracking system which\nuses a single Kalman Filter (KF) - a special case of Bayes filter - to localise\nand track a ground vehicle. Its perception system, based on convolutional\nneural networks, processes a high-resolution Wide Area Motion Imagery (WAMI)\ndata stream. Experimental results show that our algorithms can not only verify\nthe properties of the WAMI tracking system but also provide representative\nexamples, the latter of which inspired us to take an enhanced LE-SESs design\nwhere runtime monitors or joint-KFs are required.

For low device\ncurrents, magnetoelectroluminescence (MEL) perfectly follows Boltzmann\nactivation, implying a virtually complete polarization outcome. As the current\nincreases, the MEL effect is reduced because spin polarization is suppressed by\nthe reduction in carrier residence time within the device. Under these\nconditions, an additional field-dependent process affecting the spin-dependent\nrecombination emerges, which appears to relate to the build-up of triplet\nexcitons and the interaction with free charge carriers. Suppression of the EL\nat high fields on its own does not, strictly, prove electronic spin\npolarization. We therefore probe changes in the spin statistics of\nrecombination directly in a dual singlettriplet emitting OLED, which shows a\nconcomitant rise in phosphorescence intensity as fluorescence is suppressed.\nFinite spin-orbit coupling in these materials gives rise to a microscopic\ndistribution in effective g factors of electrons and holes, $\\Delta g$, i.e. a\ndistribution in Larmor frequencies, leading to singlet-triplet mixing within\nthe electronhole pair as a function of applied field. This $\\Delta g$ effect in\nthe pair further suppresses singlet-exciton formation in addition to thermal\nspin polarization of the individual carriers. Since the $\\Delta g$ process\ninvolves weakly bound carrier pairs rather than free electrons and holes, in\ncontrast to thermal spin polarization, the effect does not depend significantly\non current or temperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Oct 2020 11:10:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-28"}

The dependence of the giant NLH effect as a function of electric\ngating, strain and twist angle is further investigated systematically.\nImportantly, we point out that the giant NLH effect appears generically for\ntwist angle near the magic angle due to the strong susceptibility of nearly\nflat moir\\'{e} bands to symmetry breaking induced by strains. Our results\nestablish TBG as a practical platform for tunable NLH effect and novel\ntransport phenomena driven by nontrivial Berry phases.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Oct 2020 11:53:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-19"}

By contrast, this\npaper proves that LfO is almost equivalent to LfD in the deterministic robot\nenvironment, and more generally even in the robot environment with bounded\nrandomness. In the deterministic robot environment, from the perspective of the\ncontrol theory, we show that the inverse dynamics disagreement between LfO and\nLfD approaches zero, meaning that LfO is almost equivalent to LfD. To further\nrelax the deterministic constraint and better adapt to the practical\nenvironment, we consider bounded randomness in the robot environment and prove\nthat the optimizing targets for both LfD and LfO remain almost same in the more\ngeneralized setting. Extensive experiments for multiple robot tasks are\nconducted to empirically demonstrate that LfO achieves comparable performance\nto LfD. In fact, most common robot systems in reality are the robot environment\nwith bounded randomness (i.e., the environment this paper considered).

While dynamic time warping (DTW) is popularly used for\nthis purpose, it is not differentiable everywhere and is known to lead to bad\nlocal optima when used as a \"loss\". Soft-DTW addresses these issues, but it is\nnot a positive definite divergence: due to the bias introduced by entropic\nregularization, it can be negative and it is not minimized when the time series\nare equal.

We also propose a new \"sharp\" variant by further removing entropic\nbias.

In the light of this recent breakthrough, we here\ncompare self-supervised networks to supervised models and human behaviour. We\ntested models on 15 generalisation datasets for which large-scale human\nbehavioural data is available (130K highly controlled psychophysical trials).\nSurprisingly, current self-supervised CNNs share four key characteristics of\ntheir supervised counterparts: (1.) relatively poor noise robustness (with the\nnotable exception of SimCLR), (2.) non-human category-level error patterns,\n(3.) non-human image-level error patterns (yet high similarity to supervised\nmodel errors) and (4.) a bias towards texture.

Some of these sequences have\naided traditional linear encoding in the estimation of white matter\nmicrostructural features, generally by making DW-MRI less sensitive to the\norientation of axon fascicles in a voxel. However, less is known about their\npotential to make the signal more sensitive to fascicle orientation, especially\nin crossing-fascicle voxels.\n  Although planar encoding has been commended for the resemblance of its signal\nwith the voxel's orientation distribution function (ODF), linear encoding\nremains the near undisputed method of choice for orientation estimation. This\npaper presents a theoretical framework to gauge the sensitivity of axisymmetric\nB-tensors to fascicle orientations. A signal peak separation index (SPSI) is\nproposed, motivated by theoretical considerations on a simple multi-tensor\nmodel of fascicle crossing.

At identical SPSI\nhowever, oblate B-tensors yield higher signal and may be more robust to\nacquisition noise than their prolate counterparts.

The dependence of the\nvolumes of the uncertainty regions on camera baseline length, focal length,\npixel size, and distance to object, shows that earlier studies overestimated\nthe quantization error by at least a factor of two.

However, the bottleneck of deep learning\nbased 3D face recognition is that it is difficult to collect millions of 3D\nfaces, whether for industry or academia. In view of this situation, there are\nmany methods to generate more 3D faces from existing 3D faces through 3D face\ndata augmentation, which are used to train deep 3D face recognition models.\nHowever, to the best of our knowledge, there is no method to generate 3D faces\nfrom 2D face images for training deep 3D face recognition models. This letter\nfocuses on the role of reconstructed 3D facial surfaces in 3D face\nidentification and proposes a framework of 2D-aided deep 3D face\nidentification. In particular, we propose to reconstruct millions of 3D face\nscans from a large scale 2D face database (i.e.VGGFace2), using a deep learning\nbased 3D face reconstruction method (i.e.ExpNet). Then, we adopt a two-phase\ntraining approach: In the first phase, we use millions of face images to\npre-train the deep convolutional neural network (DCNN), and in the second\nphase, we use normal component images (NCI) of reconstructed 3D face scans to\ntrain the DCNN.

Finally, our proposed approach achieves\nstate-of-the-art rank-1 scores on the FRGC v2.0 (97.6%), Bosphorus (98.4%), and\nBU-3DFE (98.8%) databases.

In variational data assimilation the posterior is\ncomputed by solving a nonlinear least squares problem. Many numerical weather\nprediction (NWP) centres use full observation error covariance (OEC) weighting\nmatrices, which can slow convergence of the data assimilation procedure.\nPrevious work revealed the importance of the minimum eigenvalue of the OEC\nmatrix for conditioning and convergence of the unpreconditioned data\nassimilation problem. In this paper we examine the use of correlated OEC\nmatrices in the preconditioned data assimilation problem for the first time. We\nconsider the case where there are more state variables than observations, which\nis typical for applications with sparse measurements e.g. NWP and remote\nsensing.

Numerical experiments\nreveal that the condition number of the Hessian is minimised when the\nbackground and observation lengthscales are equal. This contrasts with the\nunpreconditioned case, where decreasing the observation error lengthscale\nalways improves conditioning. Conjugate gradient experiments show that in this\nframework the condition number of the Hessian is a good proxy for convergence.\nEigenvalue clustering explains cases where convergence is faster than expected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Oct 2020 14:31:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 May 2021 10:43:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-24"}

For this reason, mmWave\nwireless backhaul is being considered as a cost-effective and flexible\nalternative that has potential to support the high-rate transmission needed to\naccommodate backhaul traffic demands. However, maintaining a high network\nsurvivability is extremely important since networks based on mmWave\ncommunication are susceptible to short-term blockages or node failures caused\nby unforeseen events. Therefore, to realize a robust mmWave backhaul network,\nseveral works propose to adopt a triangular-wave topology in roadside\nenvironments, which can eliminate the mutual interference among backhaul links,\nand provide robustness to blockage effects. Based on this novel topology, we\ninvestigate a blockage type detection scheme, which reacts to blockage effects\nquickly and assists in various path reconfiguration approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Oct 2020 14:47:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 24 Oct 2020 14:52:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-27"}

First, we identify necessary and sufficient conditions on the\nopen-loop and closed-loop dynamics of the plants that ensure existence of\npurely time-dependent periodic scheduling sequences under which stability of\neach plant is preserved for all admissible data loss signals. Second, given the\nopen-loop and closed-loop dynamics of the plants, relevant parameters of the\nshared network and a period for the scheduling sequence, we present an\nalgorithm that verifies our stability conditions and if satisfied, designs\nstabilizing scheduling sequences. Otherwise, the algorithm reports\nnon-existence of a stabilizing periodic scheduling sequence with the given\nperiod and stability margins. Third, given the plant matrices, the parameters\nof the network and a period for the scheduling sequence, we present an\nalgorithm that designs static state-feedback controllers such that our\nstability conditions are satisfied. The main apparatus for our analysis is a\nswitched systems representation of the individual plants in an NCS whose\nswitching signals are time-inhomogeneous Markov chains. Our stability\nconditions rely on the existence of sets of symmetric and positive definite\nmatrices that satisfy certain (in)equalities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Oct 2020 15:20:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-11"}

We provide the\nnucleosynthetic yields of intermediate-mass Z=$10^{-5}$ stars between 3 and 7.5\n$M_{sun}$, and quantify the effects of the uncertain wind rates.

We compare our results to\nobservations of CEMP-s stars belonging to the Halo. The yields of\nintermediate-mass EMP stars reflect the effects of very deep second dredge-up\n(for the most massive models), superimposed with the combined signatures of\nhot-bottom burning and third dredge-up. We confirm the reported trend that\nmodels with initial metallicity Z$_{ini}$ <= 0.001 give positive yields of\n$^{12}C, ^{15}N, ^{16}O$, and $^{26}Mg$. The $^{20}Ne, ^{21}Ne$, and $^{24}Mg$\nyields, which were reported to be negative at Z$_{ini}$ = 0.0001, become\npositive for Z=$10^{-5}$. The results using two different prescriptions for\nmass-loss rates differ widely in terms of the duration of the thermally-pulsing\n(Super) AGB phase, overall efficiency of the third dredge-up episode, and\nnucleosynthetic yields. The most efficient of the standard wind rates\nfrequently used in the literature seems to favour agreement between our yield\nresults and observational data.

In recent years,\nenabled by the massive fine-grained smart meter data, deep learning (DL)\napproaches are becoming popular in the literature to detect energy theft in the\nadvanced metering infrastructure (AMI). However, as neural networks are shown\nto be vulnerable to adversarial examples, the security of the DL models is of\nconcern.\n  In this work, we study the vulnerabilities of DL-based energy theft detection\nthrough adversarial attacks, including single-step attacks and iterative\nattacks. From the attacker's point of view, we design the\n\\textit{SearchFromFree} framework that consists of 1) a randomly adversarial\nmeasurement initialization approach to maximize the stolen profit and 2) a\nstep-size searching scheme to increase the performance of black-box iterative\nattacks. The evaluation based on three types of neural networks shows that the\nadversarial attacker can report extremely low consumption measurements to the\nutility without being detected by the DL models. We finally discuss the\npotential defense mechanisms against adversarial attacks in energy theft\ndetection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Oct 2020 02:25:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-20"}

A similar formula for the Masur-Veech volume (though without\nexplicit evaluation) was obtained earlier by Mirzakhani via completely\ndifferent approach.\n  Furthermore, we prove that the density of the mapping class group orbit of\nany simple closed multicurve $\\gamma$ inside the ambient set of integral\nmeasured laminations computed by Mirzakhani coincides with the density of\nsquare-tiled surfaces having horizontal cylinder decomposition associated to\n$\\gamma$ among all square-tiled surfaces in $\\mathcal{Q}_{g,n}$.\n  We study the resulting densities (or, equivalently, volume contributions) in\nmore detail in the special case $n=0$. In particular, we compute the asymptotic\nfrequencies of separating and non-separating simple closed geodesics on a\nclosed hyperbolic surface of genus $g$ for small $g$ and we show that for large\ngenera the separating closed geodesics are $\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{3\\pi\ng}}\\cdot\\frac{1}{4^g}$ times less frequent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Oct 2020 09:34:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-03"}
