Structured network pruning discards the whole neuron or filter, leading\nto accuracy loss. In this work, we propose a novel concept of neuron merging\napplicable to both fully connected layers and convolution layers, which\ncompensates for the information loss due to the pruned neurons/filters. Neuron\nmerging starts with decomposing the original weights into two matrices/tensors.\nOne of them becomes the new weights for the current layer, and the other is\nwhat we name a scaling matrix, guiding the combination of neurons. If the\nactivation function is ReLU, the scaling matrix can be absorbed into the next\nlayer under certain conditions, compensating for the removed neurons. We also\npropose a data-free and inexpensive method to decompose the weights by\nutilizing the cosine similarity between neurons.

In this paper we\nleverage novel techniques of GSP to develop a hierarchical feature extraction\napproach by mapping the data onto a series of spatiotemporal graphs. Such a\nmodel maps signals onto vertices of a graph and the time-space dependencies\namong signals are modeled by the edge weights. Signal components acquired from\ndifferent locations and time often have complicated functional dependencies.\nAccordingly, their corresponding graph weights are learned from data and used\nin two ways. First, they are used as a part of the embedding related to the\ntopology of graph, such as density. Second, they provide the connectivities of\nthe base graph for extracting higher level GSP-based features. The latter\ninclude the energies of the signal's graph Fourier transform in different\nfrequency bands. We test our approach on the intracranial EEG (iEEG) data set\nof the Kaggle epileptic seizure detection contest.

However, sampling rates that are much higher than the\nNyquist rate of the signal are required for high resolution DAS beamforming,\nleading to large amounts of data, making transmission of channel data over WIFI\nimpractical.

Therefore, we formulate amodal segmentation as an out-of-task and\nout-of-distribution generalization problem. Specifically, we replace the fully\nconnected classifier in neural networks with a Bayesian generative model of the\nneural network features.

Finally, we show a special case\nwhere lazy propagation can be generalized for $d\\ge 2$ and where updates and\nqueries can run in $O(\\log^d N)$ worst-case time. We present an algorithm that\nmeets this running time and is simpler than similar algorithms of previous\nworks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Oct 2020 18:17:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-27"}

We show that the former is more important than the latter, but\nthat, other than a few outliers, our design shows a performance (= aggregate\nuser utility) close to the theoretical optimum.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Oct 2020 19:14:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-27"}

In\ngeneral, the performance gap between CF massive MIMO systems and SCs is\nenhanced by increasing the AP density.

We have witnessed a huge surge of such\nembedding methods, from statistical approaches to recent deep learning methods\nsuch as the graph convolutional networks (GCN). Deep learning approaches\nusually outperform the traditional methods in most graph learning benchmarks by\nbuilding an end-to-end learning framework to optimize the loss function\ndirectly.

We find that the membrane\ntermination changes as a function of the pH and the potential, which affects\nthe adhesion strength and the energy requirements for partial membrane\ndetachment, controlling the Pt surface area that is accessible for reactant\nspecies. The charge-transfer between the Pt surface and the SiO$_2$ membrane is\nalso pH and potential dependent and results in changes of the Pt surface d-band\nstates, which are known to correlate with catalytic activity. Our analysis\nreveals the complex response of a buried interface to the electrochemical\nenvironment and identifies trends that are expected to apply also to other\nmembrane-coated electrocatalysts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Oct 2020 23:35:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-27"}

Dual-energy CT (DECT) is\ndesirable to differentiate multiple materials, but DECT scanners are not widely\navailable as single-energy CT (SECT) scanners. Here we purpose a deep learning\napproach to perform DECT imaging by using standard SECT data. We designed a\npredenoising and difference learning mechanism to generate DECT images from\nSECT data. The performance of the deep learning-based DECT approach was studied\nusing images from patients who received contrast-enhanced abdomen DECT scan\nwith a popular DE application: virtual non-contrast (VNC) imaging and contrast\nquantification.

The simulations are based on\nthe infinite time-evolving block decimation (iTEBD) method and exact\ndiagonalization. We clarify that the HHG originates from the doublon-holon\nrecombination, and the scaling of the cutoff frequency is consistent with a\nlinear dependence on the external field. We demonstrate that the subcycle\nfeatures of the HHG can be reasonably described by a phenomenological three\nstep model for a doublon-holon pair. We argue that the HHG in the\none-dimensional Mott insulator is closely related to the dispersion of the\ndoublon-holon pair with respect to its relative momentum, which is not\nnecessarily captured by the single-particle spectrum due to the many-body\nnature of the elementary excitations. For the comparison to semiconductors, we\nintroduce effective models obtained from the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation,\ni.e. a strong-coupling expansion, which allows us to disentangle the different\nprocesses involved in the Hubbard model: intraband dynamics of doublons and\nholons, interband dipole excitations, and spin exchanges. These demonstrate the\nformal similarity of the Mott system to the semiconductor models in the dipole\ngauge, and reveal that the spin dynamics, which does not directly affect the\ncharge dynamics, can reduce the HHG intensity. We also show that the long-range\ncomponent of the intraband dipole moment has a substantial effect on the HHG\nintensity, while the correlated hopping terms for the doublons and holons\nessentially determine the shape of the HHG spectrum.

While a set of candidate\nstencils of incremental width is constructed, each one is indicated as smooth\nor nonsmooth by the ENO-like stencil selection procedure proposed in the\ntargeted essentially non-oscillatory (TENO) scheme [Fu et al., Journal of\nComputational Physics 305 (2016): 333-359]. Rather than being discarded\ndirectly as with TENO schemes, the nonsmooth candidates are filtered by an\nextra nonlinear limiter, such as a monotonicity-preserving (MP) limiter or a\ntotal variation diminishing (TVD) limiter. Consequently, high-order\nreconstruction is achieved by assembling candidate fluxes with optimal linear\nweights since they are either smooth reconstructions or filtered ones which\nfeature good non-oscillation property. A weight renormalization procedure as\nwith the standard TENO paradigm is not necessary. This new framework\nconcatenates the concepts of TENO, WENO and other nonlinear limiters for\nshock-capturing, and provides a new insight to designing low-dissipation\nnonlinear schemes. Through the adaptation of nonlinear limiters, nonlinear\ndissipation in the newly proposed framework can be controlled separately\nwithout affecting the performance in smooth regions. Based on the proposed\nframework, a family of new six- and eight-point nonlinear schemes with\ncontrollable dissipation is proposed. A set of critical benchmark cases\ninvolving strong discontinuities and broadband fluctuations is simulated.\nNumerical results reveal that the proposed new schemes capture discontinuities\nsharply and resolve the high-wavenumber fluctuations with low dissipation,\nwhile maintaining the desired accuracy order in smooth regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Oct 2020 02:37:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}

We then perform supervised classification,\nconstructing three electronic-state classifiers: metal vs non-metal (M),\ninsulator vs non-insulator (I), and MIT vs non-MIT (T). We identify two\nimportant descriptors that separate metals, insulators, and MIT materials in a\n2D feature space: the average deviation of the covalent radius and the range of\nthe Mendeleev number. We further elaborate on other important features (GII and\nEwald energy), and examine how they affect classification of binary vanadium\nand titanium oxides. We discuss the relationship of these atomic features to\nthe physical interactions underlying MITs in the rare-earth nickelate family.\nLast, we implement an online version of the classifiers, enabling quick\nprobabilistic class predictions by uploading a crystallographic structure file.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Oct 2020 03:26:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Jul 2021 14:06:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-20"}

Given the constant\nresolution with range of a SAS, it is no surprise that deep learning techniques\nperform so well. Despite deep learning's recent success, there are still\ncompelling open challenges in reducing the high false alarm rate and enabling\nsuccess when training imagery is limited, which is a practical challenge that\ndistinguishes the SAS classification problem from standard image classification\nset-ups where training imagery may be abundant. We address these challenges by\nexploiting prior knowledge that humans use to grasp the scene. These include\nunconscious elimination of the image speckle and localization of objects in the\nscene. We introduce a new deep learning architecture which incorporates these\npriors with the goal of improving automatic target recognition (ATR) from SAS\nimagery. Our proposal -- called SPDRDL, Structural Prior Driven Regularized\nDeep Learning -- incorporates the previously mentioned priors in a multi-task\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) and requires no additional training data\nwhen compared to traditional SAS ATR methods. Two structural priors are\nenforced via regularization terms in the learning of the network: (1)\nstructural similarity prior -- enhanced imagery (often through despeckling)\naids human interpretation and is semantically similar to the original imagery\nand (2) structural scene context priors -- learned features ideally encapsulate\ntarget centering information; hence learning may be enhanced via a\nregularization that encourages fidelity against known ground truth target\nshifts (relative target position from scene center).

Although convergence acceleration is a remarkable\nadvantage of deep unfolding, its theoretical aspects have not been revealed\nyet. The first half of this study details the theoretical analysis of the\nconvergence acceleration in deep-unfolded gradient descent (DUGD) whose\ntrainable parameters are step sizes. We propose a plausible interpretation of\nthe learned step-size parameters in DUGD by introducing the principle of\nChebyshev steps derived from Chebyshev polynomials. The use of Chebyshev steps\nin gradient descent (GD) enables us to bound the spectral radius of a matrix\ngoverning the convergence speed of GD, leading to a tight upper bound on the\nconvergence rate. The convergence rate of GD using Chebyshev steps is shown to\nbe asymptotically optimal, although it has no momentum terms.

Our approach leverages a recent contrastive learning\nframework, which learns representations by maximizing feature consistency under\ndifferently augmented views. This fits particularly well with the goal of\nadversarial robustness, as one cause of adversarial fragility is the lack of\nfeature invariance, i.e., small input perturbations can result in undesirable\nlarge changes in features or even predicted labels. We explore various options\nto formulate the contrastive task, and demonstrate that by injecting\nadversarial perturbations, contrastive pre-training can lead to models that are\nboth label-efficient and robust. We empirically evaluate the proposed\nAdversarial Contrastive Learning (ACL) and show it can consistently outperform\nexisting methods. For example on the CIFAR-10 dataset, ACL outperforms the\nprevious state-of-the-art unsupervised robust pre-training approach by 2.99% on\nrobust accuracy and 2.14% on standard accuracy.

Forecasts show that the mean time between failures could be lower\nthan the time to recover from such a checkpoint, so that large calculations at\nscale might not make any progress if robust alternatives are not investigated.\n  More advanced resilience techniques must be devised. The key may lie in\nexploiting both advanced system features as well as specific application\nknowledge. Research will face two essential questions: (1) what are the\nreliability requirements for a particular computation and (2) how do we best\ndesign the algorithms and software to meet these requirements? One avenue would\nbe to refine and improve on system- or application-level checkpointing and\nrollback strategies in the case an error is detected.

In this\nfield, a long-standing challenge is how to find a large number of\nhighly-reliable landmarks, which is the key to improve the precision of IP\ngeolocation. To this end, many efforts have been made, while many IP\ngeolocation methods still suffer from unacceptable error distance because of\nthe lack of landmarks. In this paper, we propose a novel IP geolocation system,\nnamed XLBoost-Geo, which focuses on enhancing the number and the density of\nhighly reliable landmarks. The main idea is to extract location-indicating\nclues from web pages and locating the web servers based on the clues. Based on\nthe landmarks, XLBoost-Geo is able to geolocate arbitrary IPs with little error\ndistance. Specifically, we first design an entity extracting method based on a\nbidirectional LSTM neural network with a self-adaptive loss function (LSTM-Ada)\nto extract the location-indicating clues on web pages and then generate\nlandmarks based on the clues. Then, by measurements on network latency and\ntopology, we estimate the closest landmark and associate the coordinate of the\nlandmark with the location of the target IP. The results of our experiments\nclearly validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the extracting method, the\nprecision, number, coverage of the landmarks, and the precision of the IP\ngeolocation. On RIPE Atlas nodes, XLBoost-Geo achieves 2,561m median error\ndistance, which outperforms SLG and IPIP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Oct 2020 07:47:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-27"}

Recently, robust\noptimization (RO) models have attracted a lot of interest in this area. RO\nprovides a computationally tractable framework for portfolio optimization based\non relatively general assumptions on the probability distributions of the\nuncertain risk parameters. Thus, RO extends the framework of traditional linear\nand non-linear models (e.g., the well-known mean-variance model), incorporating\nuncertainty through a formal and analytical approach into the modeling process.\nRobust counterparts of existing models can be considered as worst-case\nre-formulations as far as deviations of the uncertain parameters from their\nnominal values are concerned.

Traditional methods consist of manually designed rules\nas the driving policy, which require expert domain knowledge, are difficult to\ngeneralize and might give sub-optimal results as the environment gets complex.\nWhereas, using reinforcement learning, optimal driving policy could be learned\nand improved automatically through several interactions with the environment.\nHowever, current research in the field of reinforcement learning for autonomous\ndriving is mainly focused on highway setup with little to no emphasis on urban\nenvironments. In this work, a deep reinforcement learning based decision-making\napproach for high-level driving behavior is proposed for urban environments in\nthe presence of pedestrians.

This is an important engineering problem as networks\ndesigned differ in parameter values due to tolerance during manufacture from\ntheir actual realizations in chips and hardware. Parameters also undergo\nchanges due to environmental factors. Hence, practical use of networks requires\ncompensation which is only possible by connecting compensating network at the\nports. The resulting interconnection is then required to be stable over a range\nof parameter values. This is called robust compensation. This paper formulates\nsuch a problem using an extension of the coprime factorization theory well\nknown in feedback control theory to the situation of multiport network\ninterconnection developed in \\cite{msm1} and formulates the robust\nstabilization problem as an $H_{\\infty}$ optimization problem.

Hence the well known stabilization and stability\ntheory of feedback systems cannot be utilized for such a problem.

The variations of parameters of\nthe network are used to define a worst case neighborhood of the network in\nterms of its coprime fractions at the nominal values of parameters.

So in this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised\nlearning method using a lot of short videos which has no human labeling, and\nimprove the tracking performance through the re-identification network trained\nin the self-supervised manner to solve the lack of training data problem.\nDespite the re-identification network is trained in a self-supervised manner,\nit achieves the state-of-the-art performance of MOTA 62.0\\% and IDF1 62.6\\% on\nthe MOT17 test benchmark. Furthermore, the performance is improved as much as\nlearned with a large amount of data, it shows the potential of self-supervised\nmethod.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Oct 2020 08:48:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-27"}

More massive stars enter the giant and\nsupergiant phases closer to the ZAMS, but not as close as for solar\nmetallicity. This is due to the reduced stellar winds at lower metallicity. Our\nmodels with masses higher than ~60 Msun should appear as O and B stars, whereas\nthese objects are not observed, confirming a trend reported in the recent\nliterature. At Z=1/30 Zsun, dwarfs cover a wider fraction of the MS and giants\nand supergiants appear at lower effective temperatures than at Z=1/5 Zsun.

ITG modes that localize\nwithin bad drift curvature wells that have a critical gradient set by peak\ndrift curvature are also observed. A case study of nearly helical stellarators\nof increasing field period demonstrates that the critical gradient can indeed\nbe controlled by manipulating magnetic geometry, but underscores the need for a\ngeneral framework to evaluate the critical gradient. We conclude that average\ncurvature and global shear set the correlation length of resonant ITG modes\nnear the absolute critical gradient, the physics of which is included through\ndirect solution of the gyrokinetic equation. Our method, which handles general\ngeometry and is more efficient than conventional gyrokinetic solvers, could be\napplied to future studies of stellarator ITG turbulence optimization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Oct 2020 09:27:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Apr 2021 09:01:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-24"}

To recover individual components, the SST\nmethod consists of two steps. First the instantaneous frequency (IF) of a\ncomponent is estimated from the SST plane. Secondly, after IF is recovered, the\nassociated component is computed by a definite integral along the estimated IF\ncurve on the SST plane. The reconstruction accuracy for a component depends\nheavily on the accuracy of the IFs estimation carried out in the first step.\nMore recently, a direct method of the time-frequency approach, called signal\nseparation operation (SSO), was introduced for multi-component signal\nseparation. While both SST and SSO are mathematically rigorous on IF\nestimation, SSO avoids the second step of the two-step SST method in component\nrecovery (mode retrieval). The SSO method is based on some variant of the\nshort-time Fourier transform.

However, Geo-I is based\non the Euclidean plane even though many LBSs are based on road networks (e.g.\nride-sharing services). This causes unnecessary noise and thus an insufficient\ntradeoff between utility and privacy for LBSs on road networks. To address this\nissue, we propose a new privacy notion, Geo-Graph-Indistinguishability (GG-I),\nfor locations on a road network to achieve a better tradeoff.

However, to date, Bayesian\ncalibration has not been used often in health decision sciences due to\npractical and computational burdens. In this paper we propose to use artificial\nneural networks (ANN) as one solution to these limitations.\n  Methods: Bayesian Calibration using Artificial Neural Networks (BayCANN)\ninvolves (1) training an ANN metamodel on a sample of model inputs and outputs,\nand (2) then calibrating the trained ANN metamodel instead of the full model in\na probabilistic programming language to obtain the posterior joint distribution\nof the calibrated parameters. We demonstrate BayCANN by calibrating a natural\nhistory model of colorectal cancer to adenoma prevalence and cancer incidence\ndata. In addition, we compare the efficiency and accuracy of BayCANN against\nperforming a Bayesian calibration directly on the simulation model using an\nincremental mixture importance sampling (IMIS) algorithm.\n  Results: BayCANN was generally more accurate than IMIS in recovering the\n\"true\" parameter values.

An often\nobserved common goal there is to optimize these systems for specific purposes\nby minimizing certain costs while maximizing a desired output. Acknowledging\nthat especially real-world systems from the coupled socio-ecological realm are\nhighly intertwined this work exemplifies that in such systems the optimization\nof a certain subsystem, e.g., to increase the resilience against external\npressure in an ecological network, may unexpectedly diminish the stability of\nthe whole coupled system. For this purpose we utilize an adaptation of a\npreviously proposed conceptual bilayer network model composed of an ecological\nnetwork of diffusively coupled resources co-evolving with a social network of\ninteracting agents that harvest these resources and learn each other's\nstrategies depending on individual success. We derive an optimal coupling\nstrength that prevents a collapse in as many resources as possible if one\nassumes that the agents' strategies remain constant over time. However, we then\nshow that if agents socially learn and adapt strategies according to their\nneighbors' success, this optimal coupling strength is revealed to be a critical\nparameter above which the probability for a global collapse in terms of\nirreversibly depleted resources is high -- an effect that we denote the tragedy\nof the optimizer. We thus find that measures which stabilize the dynamics\nwithin a certain part of a larger co-evolutionary system may unexpectedly cause\nthe emergence of novel undesired globally stable states. Our results therefore\nunderline the importance of holistic approaches for managing socio-ecological\nsystems because stabilizing effects which focus on single subsystems may be\ncounter-beneficial for the system as a whole.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Oct 2020 10:10:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2021 15:22:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-11"}

In loop quantum\ngravity (LQG) models were presented, which resolve the classical singularity in\nthe centre of the black hole by means of a black-to-white hole transition, but\nneglect the collapse process. The situation is similar in other quantum gravity\napproaches, where eternal non-singular models are available. In this paper, a\nstrategy is presented to generalise these eternal models to dynamical collapse\nmodels by surface matching. Assuming 1) the validity of a static quantum black\nhole spacetime outside the collapsing matter, 2) homogeneity of the collapsing\nmatter, and 3) differentiability at the surface of the matter fixes the\ndynamics of the spacetime uniquely. It is argued that these assumptions\nresemble a collapse of pressure-less dust and thus generalises the\nOppenheimer-Snyder-Datt model, although no precise model of the matter has to\nbe assumed. Hawking radiation is systematically neglected in this approach. The\njunction conditions and the spacetime dynamics are discussed generically for\nbouncing black hole spacetimes, as proposed by LQG, although the scheme is\napproach independent. Further, the equations are explicitly solved for the\nrecent model [1] and a global spacetime picture of the collapse is achieved.\nThe causal structure is discussed in detail and the Penrose diagram is\nconstructed. The trajectory of the collapsing matter is completely constructed\nfrom an inside and outside observer point of view. The general analysis shows\nthat the matter is collapsing and re-expanding and crosses the Penrose diagram\ndiagonally. This way the infinite tower of Penrose diagrams, as proposed by\nseveral LQG models, is generically not cut out. Questions about different\ntimescales of the collapse for in- and outside observers can be answered.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Oct 2020 10:57:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Aug 2021 11:35:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-17"}

The PICOSEC detector is a novel gas-filled detector,\nbased on the Micromegas detector, which has been developed by the RD-51 PICOSEC\ncollaboration. Instead of relying on traditional direct ionization, the PICOSEC\ndetector takes advantage of the prompt timing characteristics of Cherenkov\nradiation by converting the Cherenkov photons into electrons through the use of\na photocathode. The detector has been put into two type of tests where\nexperimental data are collected. One involves a laser beam and a single\nphotoelectron response at CEA-SACLAY, while the other involves a test beam of\n150 GeV muons at the CERN SPS H4 secondary beamline, with multiple\nphotoelectrons. The methods employed in the statistical analysis of the\ndetector's timing properties are summarized and in their application an optimal\ntime resolution of 76 ps is achieved for single photoelectrons. A strange\ndependence of the mean timing on the size of the electron peak is observed,\nwhich mimics the behaviour of the \"time walk\" effect. A simulation of the\ndetector is developed to study the timing properties, which is also the main\nscope of the thesis. After a detailed investigation, it is found that the\nelectrons in the gaseous mixture move with a different drift velocity before\nand after the first multiplication, introducing this \"time walk\" effect, and a\nphenomenological explanation of this effect is provided. Finally, a maximum\nlikelihood statistical method for the estimation of the mean number of\nphotoelectron extracted per particle is developed and an optimal time\nresolution of 24 ps is achieved with a mean number of photoelectrons per\nparticle equal to 10.4. In this work, a deep understanding is acquired on a new\ndetector which has brought upon unprecedented results in the field of\ngas-filled detectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Oct 2020 12:45:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-27"}

Despite its\nimportance in many small-scale physical processes, there is presently no\naccurate theory or model for predicting the extrema as a function of the\nReynolds number. Here, we introduce a new model for the dissipation PDF based\non the concept of significant shear layers, which are thin regions of elevated\nlocal mean dissipation. At very high Reynolds numbers these significant shear\nlayers develop layered substructures. The flow domain is divided into the\ndifferent layer regions and a background region, each with their own PDF of\ndissipation. The volume weighted regional PDFs are combined to obtain the\noverall PDF, which is subsequently used to determine the dissipation variance\nand maximum. The model yields Reynolds number scalings for the dissipation\nmaximum and variance, which are in agreement with the available data. Moreover,\nthe power law scaling exponent is found to increase gradually with the Reynolds\nnumber, which is also consistent with the data. The increasing exponent is\nshown to have profound implications for turbulence at atmospheric and\nastrophysical Reynolds numbers.

The POMDP\nmodel chooses the action that maximizes the long-term expected task specific\nutility, and while doing so, considers the value of informative actions and the\neffect of different object hypotheses on the completion of the task. In\nsimulations and in experiments with an RGB-D sensor, a Kinova Jaco and a Franka\nEmika Panda robot arm, a probabilistic approach outperforms an approach that\nonly considers the most likely object composition and long term planning\noutperforms greedy decision making.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Oct 2020 13:17:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-27"}

In\norder to study grain size influence and grain boundary trapping during\npermeation, two modelling approaches are explored; a 1D Finite Element model\nincluding trap density and binding energy as input parameters and a\npolycrystalline model based on the assignment of a lower diffusivity and\nsolubility to the grain boundaries. Samples of pure iron after two different\nheat treatments - 950C for 40 minutes and 1100C for 5 minutes - are tested\napplying three consecutive rising permeation steps and three decaying steps.\nExperimental results show that the finer grain microstructure promotes a\ndiffusion delay due to grain boundary trapping. The usual methodology for the\ndetermination of trap densities and binding energies is revisited in which the\nlimiting diluted and saturated cases are considered.

In situations where the dispatcher has an\nassociated memory, one can minimize this query overhead by maintaining a list\nof idle servers to which jobs can be dispatched. Recent alternative approaches\nthat do not require querying such information include the cancel on start and\ncancel on complete based replication policies. The downside of such policies\nhowever is that the servers must communicate the start or completion of each\nservice to the dispatcher and must allow cancellation of redundant copies.

This letter studies a new IRS-aided communication system, where\nmultiple IRSs assist in the communication between a multi-antenna base station\n(BS) and a remote single-antenna user by multi-hop signal reflection.\nSpecifically, by exploiting the line-of-sight (LoS) link between nearby IRSs, a\nmulti-hop cascaded LoS link between the BS and user is established where a set\nof IRSs are selected to successively reflect the BS's signal, so that the\nreceived signal power at the user is maximized. To tackle this new problem, we\nfirst present the closed-form solutions for the optimal active and cooperative\npassive beamforming at the BS and selected IRSs, respectively, for a given beam\nroute. Then, we derive the end-to-end channel power, which unveils a\nfundamental trade-off in the optimal beam routing design between maximizing the\nmultiplicative passive beamforming gain and minimizing the multi-reflection\npath loss. To reconcile this trade-off, we recast the IRS selection and beam\nrouting problem as an equivalent shortest simple-path problem in graph theory\nand solve it optimally. Numerical results show significant performance gains of\nthe proposed algorithm over benchmark schemes and also draw useful insights\ninto the optimal beam routing design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Oct 2020 13:57:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-27"}

In this work, we focus on this offline\nsetting. Our main insight is that, when presented with offline data composed of\na variety of behaviors, an effective way to leverage this data is to extract a\ncontinuous space of recurring and temporally extended primitive behaviors\nbefore using these primitives for downstream task learning. Primitives\nextracted in this way serve two purposes: they delineate the behaviors that are\nsupported by the data from those that are not, making them useful for avoiding\ndistributional shift in offline RL; and they provide a degree of temporal\nabstraction, which reduces the effective horizon yielding better learning in\ntheory, and improved offline RL in practice. In addition to benefiting offline\npolicy optimization, we show that performing offline primitive learning in this\nway can also be leveraged for improving few-shot imitation learning as well as\nexploration and transfer in online RL on a variety of benchmark domains.\nVisualizations are available at https://sites.google.com/view/opal-iclr\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Oct 2020 14:31:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 05:54:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 4 May 2021 19:20:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-06"}

Due to the complicated collision term of the Boltzmann equation, many\nkinetic relaxation models have been proposed and used in the past seventy years\nfor the study of rarefied flow. In order to develop a multiscale method for the\nrarefied and continuum flow simulation, by adopting the integral solution of\nthe kinetic model equation a DVM-type unified gas-kinetic scheme (UGKS) has\nbeen constructed. The UGKS models the gas dynamics on the cell size and time\nstep scales while the accumulating effect from particle transport and collision\nhas been taken into account within a time step. Under the UGKS framework, a\nunified gas-kinetic wave-particle (UGKWP) method has been further developed for\nnon-equilibrium flow simulation, where the time evolution of gas distribution\nfunction is composed of analytical wave and individual particle. In the highly\nrarefied regime, particle transport and collision will play a dominant role.\nDue to the single relaxation time model for particle collision, there is a\nnoticeable discrepancy between the UGKWP solution and the full Boltzmann or\nDSMC result, especially in the high Mach and Knudsen number cases. In this\npaper, besides the kinetic relaxation model, a modification of particle\ncollision time according to the particle velocity will be implemented in UGKWP.\nAs a result, the new model greatly improves the performance of UGKWP in the\ncapturing of non-equilibrium flow. There is a perfect match between UGKWP and\nDSMC or Boltzmann solution in the highly rarefied regime. In the near continuum\nand continuum flow regime, the UGKWP will gradually get back to the macroscopic\nvariables based Navier-Stokes flow solver at small cell Knudsen number.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Oct 2020 14:34:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}

In this paper, we propose a novel Proxy-based deep Graph\nMetric Learning (ProxyGML) approach from the perspective of graph\nclassification, which uses fewer proxies yet achieves better comprehensive\nperformance. Specifically, multiple global proxies are leveraged to\ncollectively approximate the original data points for each class. To\nefficiently capture local neighbor relationships, a small number of such\nproxies are adaptively selected to construct similarity subgraphs between these\nproxies and each data point. Further, we design a novel reverse label\npropagation algorithm, by which the neighbor relationships are adjusted\naccording to ground-truth labels, so that a discriminative metric space can be\nlearned during the process of subgraph classification. Extensive experiments\ncarried out on widely-used CUB-200-2011, Cars196, and Stanford Online Products\ndatasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed ProxyGML over the\nstate-of-the-art methods in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency.

However, it is unlcear whether this preserves key properties of\nthe Boltzmann equation, such as conservation, invariances, the H-theorem, and\nfluid-dynamic limits. In this paper, we present an approach that guarantees the\nconservation properties and the correct fluid dynamic limit at leading order.\nThe concept originates from a recently developed scientific machine learning\nstrategy which has been named \"universal differential equations\". It proposes a\nhybridization that fuses the deep physical insights from classical Boltzmann\nmodeling and the desirable computational efficiency from neural network\nsurrogates. The construction of the method and the training strategy are\ndemonstrated in detail. We conduct an asymptotic analysis and illustrate its\nmulti-scale applicability.

These have their own\nlimitations, but the way we use them to emulate mock lensed systems may also\nintroduce significant artefacts. In this work we identify and explore the\nspecific impact of mass truncation on simulations of strong lenses by applying\ndifferent truncation schemes to a fiducial density profile with conformal\nisodensity contours. Our main finding is that improper mass truncation can\nintroduce undesired artificial shear. The amplitude of the spurious shear\ndepends on the shape and size of the truncation area as well as on the slope\nand ellipticity of the lens density profile. Due to this effect, the value of\nH0 or the shear amplitude inferred by modelling those systems may be biased by\nseveral percents.

Here, we use a 1D\nhydrodynamic code to investigate the long-period variability of M-type\nasymptotic giant branch stars in the nonlinear regime. We examine the period\nand stability of low-order radial pulsation modes as a function of mass and\nradius, and find overtone mode periods in complete agreement with predictions\nfrom linear pulsation models. In contrast, nonlinear models predict an earlier\nonset of dominant fundamental mode pulsation, and shorter periods at large\nradii.

The main contribution of this paper is a robust face\nalignment method that enables pixel-to-pixel warping. The method simultaneously\nestimates the rigid transformation (scale, rotation, and translation) and the\nnon-rigid deformation between two 3D point sets: a set of 3D landmarks\nextracted from an arbitrary-viewed face, and a set of 3D landmarks\nparameterized by a frontally-viewed deformable face model. An important merit\nof the proposed method is its ability to deal both with noise (small\nperturbations) and with outliers (large errors). We propose to model inliers\nand outliers with the generalized Student's t-probability distribution\nfunction, a heavy-tailed distribution that is immune to non-Gaussian errors in\nthe data.

In many practical applications the future inputs are not available to\nthe algorithm at any instance of time. So the algorithm has to make decisions\nbased on a sequence of inputs that are in order and on the fly. Such algorithms\nare known as online algorithms. For measuring the performance of online\nalgorithms, a standard measure, known as competitive analysis, has been\nextensively used in the literature. List update problem is a well studied\nresearch problem in the area of online algorithms since last few decades. One\nof the widely used deterministic online list update algorithm is the\nMove-To-Front (MTF) algorithm, which has been shown to be 2-competitive with\nbest performance in practical real life inputs. In this paper we analyse the\nMove-to-Front-or-Middle (MFM) algorithm using competitive analysis by\naddressing one of an open question raised by Albers that whether dynamic\noffline algorithm can be used in finding the competitiveness of an online\nalgorithm? Move-To-Front-or-Middle (MFM) was experimentally studied and\nobserved to be performing better than MTF algorithm by using the Calgary Corpus\nand Canterbury Corpus data set. However, it is interesting and challenging to\nfind the lower bound and upper bound on the competitive ratio of MFM algorithm.\nWe make a first attempt to find the competitiveness of MFM algorithm. Our new\nresults show that MFM is not 2-competitive with respect to static optimum\noffline algorithm, whereas it is 2-competitive with respect to dynamic optimum\noffline algorithm. Our new theoretical results may open up a new direction of\nresearch in the online list update problem by characterising the structure of\ncompetitive and non competitive deterministic online algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Oct 2020 11:09:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-29"}

Such delays reduce the performance of the\nlearning algorithm and increase the computational costs, as the reinforcement\nlearning agent values the immediate rewards more than the future reward that is\nmore related to the taken action. This paper addresses this issue by\nintroducing an applicable enhanced Q-learning method in which at the beginning\nof the learning phase, the agent takes a single action and builds a function\nthat reflects the environments response to that action, called the reflexive\n$\\gamma$ - function. During the training phase, the agent utilizes the created\nreflexive $\\gamma$- function to update the Q-values. We have applied the\ndeveloped method to a structural control problem in which the goal of the agent\nis to reduce the vibrations of a building subjected to earthquake excitations\nwith a specified delay. Seismic control problems are considered as a complex\ntask in structural engineering because of the stochastic and unpredictable\nnature of earthquakes and the complex behavior of the structure. Three\nscenarios are presented to study the effects of zero, medium, and long\naction-effect delays and the performance of the Enhanced method is compared to\nthe standard Q-learning method. Both RL methods use neural network to learn to\nestimate the state-action value function that is used to control the structure.\nThe results show that the enhanced method significantly outperforms the\nperformance of the original method in all cases, and also improves the\nstability of the algorithm in dealing with action-effect delays.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Oct 2020 19:28:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-30"}

The problem\noriginates from the fact that punishment, being costly, is an altruistic act\nand its evolution is subject to the same problem that it tries to address.

Specifically, the value/reward function regarding to the\nturn-level behaviors across human agents, chatbots and other hybrid dialog\nsystems is characterized by the incremental information and confidence gain\nbetween sentences, based on the token-level predictions from a multi-task\nneural network trained with only weak signals in dialog-level\nattributes/states. The resulting model, named Value Profiler, serves as a\ngoal-oriented dialog manager that enhances conversations by regulating\nautomated decisions with its reward and state predictions. It supports both\nreal-time monitoring and scalable offline customer experience evaluation, for\nboth bot- and human-handled contacts. We show how it improves Amazon customer\nservice quality in several applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Oct 2020 19:36:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-13"}

We report daily prediction of\nsolar energy by exploiting the strength of machine learning techniques to\ncapture and analyze complicated behavior of enormous features effectively. For\nthis purpose, dataset comprising of 98 solar stations has been taken from\nenergy competition of American Meteorological Society (AMS) for predicting\ndaily solar energy. Forecast models of base line regressors including linear,\nridge, lasso, decision tree, random forest and artificial neural networks have\nbeen implemented on the AMS solar dataset. Grid size is converted into two\nsections: 16x9 and 10x4 to ascertain attributes contributing more towards the\ngenerated power from densely located stations on global ensemble forecast\nsystem (GEFS). To evaluate the models, statistical measures of prediction error\nin terms of RMSE, MAE and R2_score have been analyzed and compared with the\nexisting techniques. It has been observed that improved accuracy is achieved\nthrough random forest and ridge regressor for both grid sizes in contrast to\nall other proposed methods. Stability and reliability of the proposed schemes\nare evaluated on a single solar station as well as on multiple independent\nruns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Oct 2020 17:56:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-02"}
