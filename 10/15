The main objective of this role is to improve the standard of\npractitioner competences and forensic procedures. One of the key strategies\ndeployed to achieve this is the push to incorporate a greater level of\nscientific conduct in the various fields of forensic practice. Currently there\nis no statutory requirement for practitioners to become accredited to continue\nworking with the Criminal Justice System of England and Wales. However, the\nForensic Science Regulator is lobbying the UK Government to make this\nmandatory. This paper focuses upon the challenge of incorporating a scientific\nmethodology to digital forensic investigations where malicious software\n('malware') has been identified. One aspect of such a methodology is the\napproach followed to both select and evaluate the tools used to perform dynamic\nmalware analysis during an investigation. Based on the literature, legal,\nregulatory and practical needs we derive a set of requirements to address this\nchallenge. We present a framework, called the 'Malware Analysis Tool Evaluation\nFramework' (MATEF), to address this lack of methodology to evaluate software\ntools used to perform dynamic malware analysis during investigations involving\nmalware and discuss how it meets the derived requirements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Oct 2020 16:01:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-15"}

The\nmultiscale transport mechanism in UGKWP is coming from the direct modeling in a\ndiscretized space, where the cell's Knudsen number, defined by the ratio of\nparticle mean free path over the numerical cell size, determines the flow\nphysics simulated by the wave particle formulation. The non-equilibrium\ndistribution function in UGKWP is tracked by the discrete particle and\nanalytical wave. The weights of distributed particle and wave in different\nregimes are controlled by the accumulating evolution solution of particle\ntransport and collision within a time step, where distinguishable macroscopic\nflow variables of particle and wave are updated inside each control volume.\nWith the variation of local cell's Knudsen number, the UGKWP becomes a particle\nmethod in the highly rarefied flow regime and converges to the gas-kinetic\nscheme (GKS) for the Navier-Stokes solution in the continuum flow regime\nwithout particles. Even targeting on the same solution as the discrete velocity\nmethod (DVM)-based unified gas-kinetic scheme (UGKS), the computational cost\nand memory requirement in UGKWP could be reduced by several orders of magnitude\nfor the high speed and high temperature flow simulation, where the\ntranslational and rotational non-equilibrium becomes important in the\ntransition and rarefied regime.

Recently proposed methods allow incorporating\ninformation on prevalent cases, individuals who survived from disease diagnosis\nto sampling, into cross-sectionally sampled case-control studies under\nparametric assumptions for the survival time after diagnosis. Here we propose\nand study methods to additionally use prospectively observed survival times\nfrom prevalent and incident cases to adjust logistic models for the time\nbetween disease diagnosis and sampling, the backward time, for prevalent cases.\nThis adjustment yields unbiased odds-ratio estimates from case-control studies\nthat include prevalent cases. We propose a computationally simple two-step\ngeneralized method-of-moments estimation procedure. First, we estimate the\nsurvival distribution based on a semi-parametric Cox model using an\nexpectation-maximization algorithm that yields fully efficient estimates and\naccommodates left truncation for the prevalent cases and right censoring.

By capturing the poses and\nrelative positions between features, its ability to recognize affine\ntransformation is improved, and it surpasses traditional convolutional neural\nnetworks (CNNs) when handling translation, rotation and scaling. The Stacked\nCapsule Autoencoder (SCAE) is the state-of-the-art capsule network. The SCAE\nencodes an image as capsules, each of which contains poses of features and\ntheir correlations. The encoded contents are then input into the downstream\nclassifier to predict the categories of the images. Existing research mainly\nfocuses on the security of capsule networks with dynamic routing or EM routing,\nand little attention has been given to the security and robustness of the SCAE.\nIn this paper, we propose an evasion attack against the SCAE. After a\nperturbation is generated based on the output of the object capsules in the\nmodel, it is added to an image to reduce the contribution of the object\ncapsules related to the original category of the image so that the perturbed\nimage will be misclassified. We evaluate the attack using an image\nclassification experiment, and the experimental results indicate that the\nattack can achieve high success rates and stealthiness. It confirms that the\nSCAE has a security vulnerability whereby it is possible to craft adversarial\nsamples without changing the original structure of the image to fool the\nclassifiers. We hope that our work will make the community aware of the threat\nof this attack and raise the attention given to the SCAE's security.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Oct 2020 16:44:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 07:18:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 9 Mar 2021 06:19:41 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 6 May 2021 07:18:50 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 20 Dec 2021 16:22:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-21"}

The GL is constructed\nfrom a kernel which depends only on the Euclidean coordinates of the inputs.\nHence, we can benefit from the full knowledge about the kernel to extend the\ncovariance structure to newly arriving samples by a Nystr\\\"{o}m type extension.\nWe provide substantial theoretical support for the GL-GP methodology, and\nillustrate performance gains in various applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Oct 2020 17:01:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Sep 2021 04:35:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 2021 19:51:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-04"}

We train a representation encoder\nby maximizing average precision (AP) for ranking, where random views of an\nimage are considered positively related, and that of the other images\nconsidered negatives. The new framework, dubbed S2R2, enables computing a\nglobal objective on multiple views, compared to the local objective in the\npopular contrastive learning framework, which is calculated on pairs of views.\nIn principle, by using a ranking criterion, we eliminate reliance on\nobject-centric curated datasets. When trained on STL10 and MS-COCO, S2R2\noutperforms SimCLR and the clustering-based contrastive learning model, SwAV,\nwhile being much simpler both conceptually and at implementation. On MS-COCO,\nS2R2 outperforms both SwAV and SimCLR with a larger margin than on STl10. This\nindicates that S2R2 is more effective on diverse scenes and could eliminate the\nneed for an object-centric large training dataset for self-supervised\nrepresentation learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Oct 2020 17:24:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Nov 2020 15:20:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-23"}

A novel distributed training algorithm using Mean\nWeight Matrix Aggregation (MWMA) is proposed for Linear Support Vector Machine\n(L-SVM) object detection based in Histogram of Orientated Gradients (HOG). In\naddition, a novel Weighted Bin Aggregation (WBA) algorithm is proposed for\ndistributed training of Ensemble of Regression Trees (ERT) landmark\nlocalization. Both algorithms do not restrict the location of model aggregation\nand allow custom architectures for model distribution. For this work, a\nPool-Based Local Training and Aggregation (PBLTA) architecture for both\nalgorithms is explored. The application of both algorithms in the medical field\nis examined using a paradigm from the fields of psychology and neuroscience -\neyeblink conditioning with infants - where models need to be trained on facial\nimages while protecting participant privacy. Using distributed learning, models\ncan be trained without sending image data to other nodes. The custom software\nhas been made available for public use on GitHub:\nhttps://github.com/SLWZwaard/DMT. Results show that the aggregation of models\nfor the HOG algorithm using MWMA not only preserves the accuracy of the model\nbut also allows for distributed learning with an accuracy increase of 0.9%\ncompared with traditional learning.

In this\nwork, we compute the Love numbers of Kerr black holes and find that they vanish\nidentically. We also compute the dissipative part of the black hole's tidal\nresponse, which is non-vanishing due to the absorptive nature of the event\nhorizon.

In this paper, we introduce a new method for simulating\nlarge-scale structure formation with neutrinos that accurately resolves the\nneutrinos down to small scales and significantly reduces the shot noise. The\nmethod works by tracking perturbations to the neutrino phase-space distribution\nwith particles and reduces shot noise in the power spectrum by a factor of\n$\\mathcal{O}\\left(10^2\\right)$ at $z=0$ for minimal neutrino masses and\nsignificantly more at higher redshifts, without neglecting the back-reaction\ncaused by neutrino clustering.

Compared to other methods we find permille level\nagreement in the matter power spectrum and percent level agreement in the\nlarge-scale neutrino bias, but large differences in the neutrino component on\nsmall scales. A basic version of the method can easily be implemented in\nexisting N-body codes and makes it possible to run neutrino simulations with\nsignificantly reduced particle load. Further gains are possible by constructing\nbackground models based on perturbation theory. A major advantage of this\ntechnique is that it works well for all masses, enabling a consistent\nexploration of the full neutrino parameter space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Oct 2020 18:00:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-18"}

Here, we answer this question in the affirmative for a paradigm\ngauge theory akin to quantum electrodynamics. Analytically, we derive a\nrenormalized gauge symmetry that is at least exponentially accurate. Further,\nnumerically computing the phase diagram in the thermodynamic limit, we find\nthat the long-distance behavior of the gauge theory is only compromised upon\nreaching a sharp quantum phase transition. This behavior is enabled by an\nenergy penalty term, which lends a mass to the Higgs boson to which the\ncoherent gauge breaking couples.

To achieve this goal, we propose a\ntwo-stage Bayesian hierarchical modeling framework. In the first stage,\nexamining the position of FFRs relative to that of some reference locations -\nin our case, schools - we model the distances of FFRs from these reference\nlocations as realizations of Inhomogenous Poisson processes (IPP). With the\ngoal of identifying representative spatial patterns of exposure to FFRs, we\nmodel the intensity functions of the IPPs using a Bayesian non-parametric\nviewpoint and specifying a Nested Dirichlet Process prior. The second stage\nmodel relates exposure patterns to obesity, offering two different approaches\nto accommodate uncertainty in the exposure patterns estimated in the first\nstage: in the first approach the odds of obesity at the school level is\nregressed on cluster indicators, each representing a major pattern of exposure\nto FFRs. In the second, we employ Bayesian Kernel Machine regression to relate\nthe odds of obesity to the multivariate vector reporting the degree of\nsimilarity of a given school to all other schools. Our analysis on the\ninfluence of patterns of FFR occurrence on obesity among Californian\nschoolchildren has indicated that, in 2010, among schools that are consistently\nassigned to a cluster, there is a lower odds of obesity amongst 9th graders who\nattend schools with most distant FFR occurrences in a 1-mile radius as compared\nto others.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Oct 2020 18:29:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-16"}

Previous benchmarks have found that ensembles of neural\nnetworks (NNs) are typically the best calibrated models on OOD data. Inspired\nby this, we leverage recent theoretical advances that characterize the\nfunction-space prior of an ensemble of infinitely-wide NNs as a Gaussian\nprocess, termed the neural network Gaussian process (NNGP). We use the NNGP\nwith a softmax link function to build a probabilistic model for multi-class\nclassification and marginalize over the latent Gaussian outputs to sample from\nthe posterior.

We also examine the calibration of\nprevious approaches to classification with the NNGP, which treat classification\nproblems as regression to the one-hot labels. In this case the Bayesian\nposterior is exact, and we compare several heuristics to generate a categorical\ndistribution over classes. We find these methods are well calibrated under\ndistributional shift. Finally, we consider an infinite-width final layer in\nconjunction with a pre-trained embedding.

However, these techniques explicitly\nassume either complete independence (local model) or complete dependence\n(global model) between time-series in the collection. This corresponds to the\ntwo extreme cases where every time-series is disconnected from every other\ntime-series in the collection or likewise, that every time-series is related to\nevery other time-series resulting in a completely connected graph. In this\nwork, we propose a deep hybrid probabilistic graph-based forecasting framework\ncalled Graph Deep Factors (GraphDF) that goes beyond these two extremes by\nallowing nodes and their time-series to be connected to others in an arbitrary\nfashion. GraphDF is a hybrid forecasting framework that consists of a\nrelational global and relational local model. In particular, we propose a\nrelational global model that learns complex non-linear time-series patterns\nglobally using the structure of the graph to improve both forecasting accuracy\nand computational efficiency. Similarly, instead of modeling every time-series\nindependently, we learn a relational local model that not only considers its\nindividual time-series but also the time-series of nodes that are connected in\nthe graph. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed deep\nhybrid graph-based forecasting model compared to the state-of-the-art methods\nin terms of its forecasting accuracy, runtime, and scalability.

In order to bring together disparate data sources, dataset discovery\nmethods rely on some form of schema matching: the process of establishing\ncorrespondences between datasets. Traditionally, schema matching has been used\nto find matching pairs of columns between a source and a target schema.\nHowever, the use of schema matching in dataset discovery methods differs from\nits original use. Nowadays schema matching serves as a building block for\nindicating and ranking inter-dataset relationships. Surprisingly, although a\ndiscovery method's success relies highly on the quality of the underlying\nmatching algorithms, the latest discovery methods employ existing schema\nmatching algorithms in an ad-hoc fashion due to the lack of openly-available\ndatasets with ground truth, reference method implementations, and evaluation\nmetrics.

A more\npractical approach is to replace human demonstrations by human queries, i.e.,\npreference-based reinforcement learning. One key limitation of the existing\nalgorithms is the need for a significant amount of human queries because a\nlarge number of labeled data is needed to train neural networks for the\napproximation of a continuous, high-dimensional reward function.

In this paper, we\nfill this gap and propose Auto-STGCN algorithm, which makes use of existing\nmodels to automatically explore high-performance STGCN model for specific\nscenarios. Specifically, we design Unified-STGCN framework, which summarizes\nthe operations of existing architectures, and use parameters to control the\nusage and characteristic attributes of each operation, so as to realize the\nparameterized representation of the STGCN architecture and the reorganization\nand fusion of advantages. Then, we present Auto-STGCN, an optimization method\nbased on reinforcement learning, to quickly search the parameter search space\nprovided by Unified-STGCN, and generate optimal STGCN models automatically.\nExtensive experiments on real-world benchmark datasets show that our Auto-STGCN\ncan find STGCN models superior to existing STGCN models with heuristic\nparameters, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Oct 2020 02:33:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-16"}

After peak\na fast component quickly arises, while the slow absorption remains superimposed\non top of it, implying the presence of at least two physically distinct flows.\nFor novae with high-cadence monitoring, a third, intermediate-velocity\ncomponent is also observed.\n  These observations are consistent with a scenario where the slow component is\nassociated with the initial ejection of the accreted material and the fast\ncomponent with a radiation-driven wind from the white dwarf. When these flows\ninteract, the slow flow is swept up by the fast flow, producing the\nintermediate component. These colliding flows may produce the gamma-ray\nemission observed in some novae.

The charged particles are detected\nbased on local changes in kinetic inductance of X and Y superconducting\nmeanderlines under a modest DC bias current. The system uses a delay-line\nmethod to locate the positions of neutron-10B reactions by acquiring the four\narrival timestamps of signals that propagate from hot spots created by a\npassing charged particle to the end electrodes of the meanderlines. Unlike\nconventional multi-pixel imaging systems, the CB-KID system performs high\nspatial resolution imaging over a 15 mm x 15 mm sensitive area using only four\nchannel readouts. Given the large sensitive area, it is important to check the\nspatial homogeneity and linearity of detected neutron positions when imaging\nwith CB-KID. To this end we imaged a pattern of 10B dot absorbers with a\nprecise dot pitch to investigate the spatial homogeneity of the detector. We\nconfirmed the spatial homogeneity of detected dot positions based on the\ndistribution of measured dot pitches across the sensitive area of the detector.\nWe demonstrate potential applications of the system by taking a clear\ntransmission image of tiny metallic screws and nuts and a ladybug. The image\nwas useful for characterizing the ladybug noninvasively. Detection efficiencies\nwere low when the detector was operated at 4 K, so we plan to explore raising\nthe operating temperature towards the critical temperature of the detector as a\nmeans to improve counting rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Oct 2020 03:16:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-21"}

The XLMD method relaxes the\nconstraints by introducing a fictitious mass $\\varepsilon$ for the latent\nvariables, solving a set of singularly perturbed ordinary differential\nequations. While favorable numerical performance of XLMD has been demonstrated\nin several different contexts in the past decade, mathematical analysis of the\nmethod remains scarce. We propose the first error analysis of the XLMD method\nin the context of a classical polarizable force field model. While the dynamics\nwith respect to the atomic degrees of freedom are general and nonlinear, the\nkey mathematical simplification of the polarizable force field model is that\nthe constraints on the latent variables are given by a linear system of\nequations. We prove that when the initial value of the latent variables is\ncompatible in a sense that we define, XLMD converges as the fictitious mass\n$\\varepsilon$ is made small with $\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon)$ error for the\natomic degrees of freedom and with $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{\\varepsilon})$ error for\nthe latent variables, when the dimension of the latent variable $d'$ is 1.\nFurthermore, when the initial value of the latent variables is improved to be\noptimally compatible in a certain sense, we prove that the convergence rate can\nbe improved to $\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon)$ for the latent variables as well.\nNumerical results verify that both estimates are sharp not only for $d' =1$,\nbut also for arbitrary $d'$. In the setting of general $d'$, we do obtain\nconvergence, but with the non-sharp rate of $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{\\varepsilon})$\nfor both the atomic and latent variables.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Oct 2020 04:17:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-16"}

Considering that current chart-based\nparsers with Transformer-based encoder represent spans by subtraction of the\nhidden states at the span boundaries, which may cause information loss\nespecially for long spans, we incorporate n-grams into span representations by\nweighting them according to their contributions to the parsing process.\nMoreover, we propose categorical span attention to further enhance the model by\nweighting n-grams within different length categories, and thus benefit\nlong-sentence parsing. Experimental results on three widely used benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in parsing Arabic,\nChinese, and English, where state-of-the-art performance is obtained by our\napproach on all of them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Oct 2020 06:36:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-16"}

Because of the typical sizes of cloud drops, their\nmotion is predominantly influenced by the smallest turbulent scales in the\nflow. We can exploit this property by using an Arnold--Beltrami--Childress\n(ABC) flow instead of a full direct numerical simulation (DNS) to simulate the\nturbulent effect on cloud drop collisions. This allows simulation of drop\nmotion using much less computational resources than needed by DNS and\ntherefore, allows for simulations with many more drops and larger model domains\nor more complex cloud physics. This is useful in cases where a specific process\nneeds to be studied and the complexity and details of a realistic turbulent\nflow are of secondary interest.\n  It is shown that the simulations using ABC flow can faithfully reproduce\ncollision statistics from much more comprehensive DNS calculations when using a\nsimilar Taylor microscale and root mean square velocity in the ABC and DNS\nflows. The results from the ABC flow are robust to changes in these two\nparameters within a reasonable range, even though adjustments to the parameters\ncan be used to further tune the results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Oct 2020 06:59:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-16"}

In addition, we\nshow that the scheme is in fact conservative, i.e. that its solution satisfy a\nconservative discrete total energy balance equation, with space and time\ndiscretizations which are unusual but consistent in the Lax-Wendroff sense.\nFinally, we observe numerically that the penalization procedure converges, i.e.\nthat making the chemical time scale tend to zero allows to converge to the\nsolution of the target (infinitely fast chemistry) continuous problem. Tests\nalso evidence that the scheme accuracy dramatically depends on the\ndiscretization of the convection operator in the chemical species mass\nbalances.

For textual modeling, they simply\nconcatenate all the reviews of a user/item into a single review. However,\nfeature extraction at word/phrase level can violate the meaning of the original\nreviews.

We introduce an end-to-end deep learning framework to\nturn images of an urban environment that include dynamic content, such as\nvehicles or pedestrians, into realistic static frames suitable for localization\nand mapping. This objective faces two main challenges: detecting the dynamic\nobjects, and inpainting the static occluded back-ground.

Thus, it\nis important to detect and control the misinformation in such platforms before\nit spreads to the masses. In this work, we focus on rumors, which is one type\nof misinformation (other types are fake news, hoaxes, etc). One way to control\nthe spread of the rumors is by identifying users who are possibly the rumor\nspreaders, that is, users who are often involved in spreading the rumors. Due\nto the lack of availability of rumor spreaders labeled dataset (which is an\nexpensive task), we use publicly available PHEME dataset, which contains rumor\nand non-rumor tweets information, and then apply a weak supervised learning\napproach to transform the PHEME dataset into rumor spreaders dataset.

In this context, we address a DNS of a turbulent jet\nspray at relatively high Reynolds number, i.e. Re=10,000. We focus on the\neffect of the jet Re on the evaporation process and the preferential\nsegregation of droplets, comparing the outcomes also with a DNS at lower\nReynolds number, Re = 6,000, in corresponding conditions. The problem is\naddressed in the hybrid Eulerian-Lagrangian framework employing the\npoint-droplet approximation. Detailed statistical analysis on both the gas and\ndispersed phases are presented. We found that the droplet vaporization length\ngrows as the bulk Re is increased from Re = 6,000 to Re = 10,000 keeping other\nconditions fixed. We attribute this result to the complex interaction between\nthe inertia of the droplets and the turbulent gaseous phase dynamics. In\nparticular, at higher Re, the slower droplet mass transfer is not able to\ncomply with the faster turbulent fluctuations of the mixing layer that tend to\nfasten the process. We also found an intense droplet clustering which is\noriginated by entrainment of dry air in the mixing layer and intensified by the\nsmall-scale clustering mechanism in the far-field region. We will show how\nclustering creates a strongly heterogeneous droplet Lagrangian evolution. All\nthese aspects contribute to the Re dependence of the overall droplet\nevaporation rate. Finally, we discuss the accuracy of the d-square law, often\nused in spray modeling, for present cases. We found that using this law based\non environmental conditions the droplet evaporation rate is overestimated.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Oct 2020 12:08:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-16"}

Methods based on inverse probability weights\nhave been widely used to estimate treatment effects with observational data.\nMachine learning techniques have been proposed to estimate propensity scores.\nThese techniques however target accuracy instead of covariate balance. Methods\nthat target covariate balance have been successfully proposed and largely\napplied to estimate treatment effects on continuous outcomes. However, in many\nmedical and epidemiological applications, the interest lies in estimating\ntreatment effects on time-to-event outcomes. With this type of data, one of the\nmost common estimands of interest is the marginal hazard ratio of the Cox\nproportional hazard model. In this paper, we start by presenting robust\northogonality weights (ROW), a set of weights obtained by solving a quadratic\nconstrained optimization problem that maximizes precision while constraining\ncovariate balance defined as the sample correlation between confounders and\ntreatment. By doing so, ROW optimally deal with both binary and continuous\ntreatments. We then evaluate the performance of the proposed weights in\nestimating marginal hazard ratios of binary and continuous treatments with\ntime-to-event outcomes in a simulation study.

This increases the\ndifficulty of a given task, adding to the existing workload and leading to\ncompromised cognitive performances. The human body expresses the use of\ncognitive resources through physiological responses when confronted with a\nplethora of cognitive workload. This temporarily mobilizes additional resources\nto deal with the workload at the cost of accelerated mental exhaustion. We\npredict that recent developments in physiological sensing will increasingly\ncreate user interfaces that are aware of the user's cognitive capacities, hence\nable to intervene when high or low states of cognitive workload are detected.\nSubsequently, we investigate suitable feedback modalities in a user-centric\ndesign process which are desirable for cognitive assistance. We then\ninvestigate different physiological sensing modalities to enable suitable\nreal-time assessments of cognitive workload. We provide evidence that the human\nbrain and eye gaze are sensitive to fluctuations in cognitive resting states.\nWe show that electroencephalography and eye tracking are reliable modalities to\nassess mental workload during user interface operation. In the end, we present\napplications that regulate cognitive workload in home and work setting,\ninvestigate how cognitive workload can be visualized to the user, and show how\ncognitive workload measurements can be used to predict the efficiency of\ninformation intake through reading interfaces. Finally, we present our vision\nof future workload-aware interfaces. Previous interfaces were limited in their\nability to utilize cognitive workload for user interaction.

With\nthis assumption, we first derive an upper bound for the reproduction numbers.\nThen we assume that a walker is in one of the states: susceptible, infectious,\nor recovered. An infectious walker remains infectious during a certain\ncharacteristic time. If an infectious walker meets a susceptible one on the\nsame node there is a certain probability for the susceptible walker to get\ninfected. By implementing this hypothesis in computer simulations we study the\nspace-time evolution of the emerging infection patterns.

Many such frameworks only ask\ncollaborators to share their local update of a common model, i.e. gradients\nwith respect to locally stored data, instead of exposing their raw data to\nother collaborators. However, recent optimization-based gradient attacks show\nthat raw data can often be accurately recovered from gradients. It has been\nshown that minimizing the Euclidean distance between true gradients and those\ncalculated from estimated data is often effective in fully recovering private\ndata. However, there is a fundamental lack of theoretical understanding of how\nand when gradients can lead to unique recovery of original data. Our research\nfills this gap by providing a closed-form recursive procedure to recover data\nfrom gradients in deep neural networks. We name it Recursive Gradient Attack on\nPrivacy (R-GAP). Experimental results demonstrate that R-GAP works as well as\nor even better than optimization-based approaches at a fraction of the\ncomputation under certain conditions.

A first-order mechanism-based strain gradient\n(MSG) plasticity theory based on Taylor's dislocation model is adopted and\nimplemented in the commercial finite element package ANSYS by means of a user\nsubroutine. Two boundary value problems are considered, a single edge tension\nspecimen and a biaxially loaded plate. First, crack tip fields are\ncharacterized. Strain gradient effects associated with dislocation hardening\nmechanisms elevate crack tip stresses relative to conventional plasticity. A\nparametric study is conducted and differences with conventional plasticity\npredictions are quantified. Moreover, the asymptotic nature of the crack tip\nsolution is investigated. The numerical results reveal that the singularity\norder predicted by the first-order MSG theory is equal or higher to that of\nlinear elastic solids. Also, the crack tip field appears not to have a\nseparable solution. Moreover, contrarily to what has been shown in the higher\norder version of MSG plasticity, the singularity order exhibits sensitivity to\nthe plastic material properties. Secondly, analytical and numerical approaches\nare employed to formulate novel amplitude factors for strain gradient\nplasticity. A generalized J-integral is derived and used to characterize a\nnonlinear amplitude factor. A closed-form equation for the analytical stress\nintensity factor is obtained. Amplitude factors are also derived by decomposing\nthe numerical solution for the crack tip stress field. Nonlinear amplitude\nfactor solutions are determined across a wide range of values for the material\nlength scale l and the strain hardening exponent N.

Such a\ndisruption effect results in the decrease of the polarization degree with\n$A_{V}$ or emission intensity, which reproduces the popular polarization holes\nobserved toward the location of protostars.

The\nnon-stationary and nonlinear characteristics of wind speed, however, makes the\ntask of wind speed forecasting challenging. LSSVM has proven to be a good\nforecasting algorithm mainly for time-series applications such as wind data. To\nboost the learning performance and generalization capability of the algorithm,\nLSSVM has two hyperparameters, known as the regularization and kernel\nparameters, that require careful tuning. In this paper, a modified QPSO\nalgorithm is proposed that uses the principle of transposon operators to breed\nthe personal best and global best particles of QPSO and improve global\nsearching capabilities.

However, it is well known that it suffers from the\ncurse of dimensionality, which is why in practice one often applies a kNN\nclassifier on top of a (pre-trained) feature transformation. From a theoretical\nperspective, most, if not all theoretical results aimed at understanding the\nkNN classifier are derived for the raw feature space. This leads to an emerging\ngap between our theoretical understanding of kNN and its practical\napplications. In this paper, we take a first step towards bridging this gap. We\nprovide a novel analysis on the convergence rates of a kNN classifier over\ntransformed features. This analysis requires in-depth understanding of the\nproperties that connect both the transformed space and the raw feature space.\nMore precisely, we build our convergence bound upon two key properties of the\ntransformed space: (1) safety -- how well can one recover the raw posterior\nfrom the transformed space, and (2) smoothness -- how complex this recovery\nfunction is. Based on our result, we are able to explain why some (pre-trained)\nfeature transformations are better suited for a kNN classifier than other.

Although this period is shorter than the most rapidly rotating pulsar\ncurrently known ($1.4$ ms), it is typical for a simulated massive NS formed\nimmediately after the coalescence of binary neutron stars (BNS). Therefore, a\nBNS merger is a good candidate for the origin of this FRB if the periodicity is\nreal.

For the first model,\ninvariant under $U(N)^3$, we obtain the RG flow of the two melonic couplings\nand the vacuum phase diagram, from a reformulation with a diagonalizable matrix\nintermediate field. The discrete chiral symmetry breaks spontaneously and we\ncompare with the three-dimensional Gross-Neveu model. Beyond the massless\n$U(N)^3$ symmetric phase, we also observe a massive phase of same symmetry and\nanother where the symmetry breaks into $U(N^2)\\times U(N/2)\\times U(N/2)$. A\nmatrix model invariant under $U(N)\\times U(N^2)$, with close properties, is\nalso studied. For the other models, with symmetry groups $U(N)^3$ and $O(N)^5$,\na non-melonic coupling (the \"wheel\") with an optimal scaling in $N$ drives us\nto a generalized melonic expansion. The kinetic terms are taken of short- and\nlong-range, and we analyze perturbatively, at large-$N$, the RG flows of the\nsextic couplings up to four loops. Only the rank-3 model displays non-trivial\nfixed points (two real Wilson-Fisher-like in the short-range case and a line of\nfixed points in the other).

The 3D bounding boxes\nof the objects are also estimated and loosely optimized within a fixed temporal\nwindow. We demonstrate that tracking dynamic objects does not only provide rich\nclues for scene understanding but is also beneficial for camera tracking.\n  The project code will be released upon acceptance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Oct 2020 15:25:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-16"}

Many\nclinical and preclinical spectral CT systems have two spectral channels for\ndual-energy CT using strategies such as split-filtration, dual-layer detectors,\nor kVp-switching. However, there are emerging clinical imaging applications\nwhich would require three or more spectral sensitivity channels, for example,\nmultiple exogenous contrast agents in a single scan. Spatial-spectral filters\nare a new spectral CT technology which use x-ray beam modulation to offer\ngreater spectral diversity.

For example, the\ndistribution of predictions is usually biased and dependents on the sensitive\nattributes (e.g., gender and ethnicity). Numerous approaches have therefore\nbeen proposed to develop decision-making systems that are\ndiscrimination-conscious by-design, which are typically batch-based and require\nthe simultaneous availability of all the training data for model learning.\nHowever, in the real-world, the data streams usually come on the fly which\nrequires the model to process each input data once \"on arrival\" and without the\nneed for storage and reprocessing. In addition, the data streams might also\nevolve over time, which further requires the model to be able to simultaneously\nadapt to non-stationary data distributions and time-evolving bias patterns,\nwith an effective and robust trade-off between accuracy and fairness.

The new results are derived for the Einstein vacuum as\nwell as for the Einstein-fluid equations describing neutrino radiation, where\nthe neutrino distribution falls off slowly towards infinity. Moreover, they\nhold for other matter and energy fields coupled to the Einstein equations as\nlong as the data obey corresponding decay laws and other conditions are\nfulfilled. The magnetic memory occurs naturally in the Einstein vacuum regime\nof pure gravitation, and in the Einstein-matter systems satisfying the\naforementioned conditions.

Electric memory is diverging as\nwell, sourced by the electric part of the curvature tensor and the\ncorresponding energy-momentum component. Shear (news) adds to the electric\nmemory.

Using our approach, (i) the\nnetwork inherits desirable features of unstructured meshes (e.g., fine and\ncoarse point spacing near the object surface and in the far field,\nrespectively), which minimizes network training cost; (ii) object geometry is\naccurately represented through vertices located on object boundaries, which\nmaintains boundary smoothness and allows the network to detect small changes\nbetween geometries; and (iii) no data interpolation is utilized for creating\ntraining data; thus accuracy of the CFD data is preserved.

Predicting high-speed data is more difficult than predicting low-speed\ndata, owing to that the number of high-speed data is limited, i.e. the quality\nof the Burgers' dataset is not satisfactory. To improve the quality of\ndatasets, traditional methods usually employ the data resampling technology to\nproduce enough data for the insufficient parts in the original datasets before\nmodeling, which increases computational costs. Recently, the mixtures of\nexperts have been used in natural language processing to deal with different\nparts of sentences, which provides a solution for eliminating the need for data\nresampling in aerodynamic data modeling.

Our results have demonstrated substantial improvement in PAM images\nwith as few as 1.4$\\%$ of the fully sampled pixels on high-speed PAM. Our\napproach outperforms interpolation, is competitive with pre-trained supervised\nDL method, and is readily translated to other high-speed, undersampling imaging\nmodalities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Oct 2020 15:46:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Apr 2021 20:02:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-09"}

BLAST compares\nsequences via similarity defined by a weighted edit distance, which results in\nit being computationally expensive. As opposed to working with edit distance, a\nvector similarity approach can be accelerated substantially using modern\nhardware or hashing techniques. Such an approach would require fixed-length\nembeddings for biological sequences. There has been recent interest in learning\nfixed-length protein embeddings using deep learning models under the hypothesis\nthat the hidden layers of supervised or semi-supervised models could produce\npotentially useful vector embeddings. We consider transformer (BERT) protein\nlanguage models that are pretrained on the TrEMBL data set and learn\nfixed-length embeddings on top of them with contextual lenses. The embeddings\nare trained to predict the family a protein belongs to for sequences in the\nPfam database. We show that for nearest-neighbor family classification,\npretraining offers a noticeable boost in performance and that the corresponding\nlearned embeddings are competitive with BLAST. Furthermore, we show that the\nraw transformer embeddings, obtained via static pooling, do not perform well on\nnearest-neighbor family classification, which suggests that learning embeddings\nin a supervised manner via contextual lenses may be a compute-efficient\nalternative to fine-tuning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Oct 2020 14:54:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-29"}

Furthermore disparate ranges of parameter\nsettings for demand and supply structure are often used, making it difficult to\ncompare one study with another.\n  To address these deficiencies, this paper proposes an experimental framework\nfor the design of numerical investigations to study how network performance\nvaries with respect to the structural properties of urban road networks. The\nkey step within this experimental framework is the generation of a spectrum of\nensembles of synthetic networks, which vary with respect to a single aspect of\nnetwork structure and which adhere to plausibility constraints that ensure\nrelevance to real urban road networks. This paper then demonstrates the\napplication of this experimental framework to an investigation of how two\nperformance indicators; the average link Volume-to-Capacity ratio and the Price\nof Anarchy, vary with respect to the density of travel demand, and the size,\ndensity and connectivity of network infrastructure. In so doing, several key\nchallenges of such investigations are identified, with respect to the\ncomputational burden of the experiments and the need for empirical data on some\nimportant aspects of network structure such as the distribution of capacity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Oct 2020 12:22:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-24"}
