Apart from being and indicator for e.g.\nfood availability, ecological change and population size, it is also a source\nof conflict between humans and birds. Moreover, massive gatherings or colonies\nof birds also get the attention of the public -- either as a spectacular\nphenomenon or as an unwelcome pest -- thereby forming the public perception of\nbirds and their abundance. In the context of the mass concentration of\nbramblings (Fringilla montifringilla) in Sweden the winter 2019-2020, this work\nreviews the literature on this striking phenomenon. Winter roosts are found to\namount to on the order of one million birds per hectare of roost area, but the\nspread between reports is significant. Support for roosts of up to around 15\nmillion birds was found, but much larger numbers are frequently recited in the\nliterature. It is argued that these larger numbers are the result of\noverestimation or, in some cases, even completely unfounded (potentially\ntypos). While the difficulties related to the count of large numbers of birds\ncan explain this state, it is unfortunate that \"high numbers\" sometimes\ndisplace proper numbers. Since incorrect data, and its persistence, may result\nin that incorrect conclusions are drawn from new observations, this matter\ndeserves attention. As the Brambling is a well-studied species, the matter also\nraises concerns regarding numbers for mass concentrations of other species. It\nis recommended that very large numbers of birds should be recited and used with\ncare: underlying data and methods of the original sources should be\nscrutinized. Analogously, reporters of large numbers of birds are advised to\ndescribe and document counting methods. In particular, number estimates based\non flock volume and bird density should be avoided.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Oct 2020 16:05:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 24 Oct 2020 13:30:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-27"}

As a result, we came up with a key set of\nterminologies that are relevant both in the fingerprinting context and in the\nIoT domain.

It uses the\ncontinuous-time quantum Monte Carlo (CTQMC) algorithm wherein the partition\nfunction is expanded in terms of the hybridisation function (CT-HYB). ComCTQMC\nsupports both partition and worm-space measurements, and it uses improved\nestimators and the reduced density matrix to improve observable measurements\nwhenever possible. ComCTQMC efficiently measures all one and two-particle\nGreen's functions, all static observables which commute with the local\nHamiltonian, and the occupation of each impurity orbital. ComCTQMC can solve\ncomplex-valued impurities with crystal fields that are hybridized to both\nfermionic and bosonic baths. Most importantly, ComCTQMC utilizes graphical\nprocessing units (GPUs), if available, to dramatically accelerate the CTQMC\nalgorithm when the Hilbert space is sufficiently large. We demonstrate\nacceleration by a factor of over 600 (100) in a simulation of $\\delta$-Pu at\n600 K with (without) crystal fields. In easier problems, the GPU offers less\nimpressive acceleration or even decelerates the CTQMC. Here we describe the\ntheory, algorithms, and structure used by ComCTQMC in order to achieve this set\nof features and level of acceleration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Oct 2020 16:33:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-28"}

Clinical studies on high-risk populations, such as\ncontact sports athletes, have become more common and give insight on the link\nbetween impact severity and brain injury risk through the use of wearable\nsensors and neurological testing. However, as the number of institutions\noperating these studies grows, there is a growing need for a platform to share\nthese data to facilitate our understanding of concussion mechanisms and aid in\nthe development of suitable diagnostic tools. To that end, this paper puts\nforth two contributions: 1) a centralized, open-source platform for storing and\nsharing head impact data, in collaboration with the Federal Interagency\nTraumatic Brain Injury Research informatics system (FITBIR), and 2) a deep\nlearning impact detection algorithm (MiGNet) to differentiate between true head\nimpacts and false positives for the previously biomechanically validated\ninstrumented mouthguard sensor (MiG2.0), all of which easily interfaces with\nFITBIR. We report 96% accuracy using MiGNet, based on a neural network model,\nimproving on previous work based on Support Vector Machines achieving 91%\naccuracy, on an out of sample dataset of high school and collegiate football\nhead impacts. The integrated MiG2.0 and FITBIR system serve as a collaborative\nresearch tool to be disseminated across multiple institutions towards creating\na standardized dataset for furthering the knowledge of concussion biomechanics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Oct 2020 16:37:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-06"}

Even though several finite element\n(FE) head models have been developed and validated to calculate brain\ndeformation based on impact kinematics, the clinical application of these FE\nhead models is limited due to the time-consuming nature of FE simulations. This\nwork aims to accelerate the process of brain deformation calculation and thus\nimprove the potential for clinical applications. Methods: We propose a deep\nlearning head model with a five-layer deep neural network and feature\nengineering, and trained and tested the model on 1803 total head impacts from a\ncombination of head model simulations and on-field college football and mixed\nmartial arts impacts. Results: The proposed deep learning head model can\ncalculate the maximum principal strain for every element in the entire brain in\nless than 0.001s (with an average root mean squared error of 0.025, and with a\nstandard deviation of 0.002 over twenty repeats with random data partition and\nmodel initialization). The contributions of various features to the predictive\npower of the model were investigated, and it was noted that the features based\non angular acceleration were found to be more predictive than the features\nbased on angular velocity. Conclusion: Trained using the dataset of 1803 head\nimpacts, this model can be applied to various sports in the calculation of\nbrain strain with accuracy, and its applicability can even further be extended\nby incorporating data from other types of head impacts.

Among these is the\ncorrelation with the flat rotation velocity of each galaxy measured either at a\nlarge radius in its rotation curve or via a spatially-integrated emission line\nwidth. We propose here the use of the de-projected integrated CO emission line\nwidth as an alternative tracer of this rotation velocity, that has already been\nshown useful for the Tully-Fisher (luminosity-rotation velocity) relation. We\ninvestigate the correlation between CO line widths and SMBH masses for two\nsamples of galaxies with dynamical SMBH mass measurements, with respectively\nspatially-resolved and unresolved CO observations. The tightest correlation is\nfound using the resolved sample of 24 galaxies as $\\log\n(M_\\mathrm{BH}/\\mathrm{M_\\odot})=(7.5\\pm0.1)+(8.5\\pm0.9)[\\log(W_\\mathrm{50}/\\sin\ni \\,\\mathrm{km\\,s}^{-1})-2.7]$, where $M_\\mathrm{BH}$ is the central SMBH mass,\n$W_{50}$ the full-width at half-maximum of a double-horned emission line\nprofile, and $i$ the inclination of the CO disc. This relation has a total\nscatter of $0.6\\,$dex, comparable to those of other SMBH mass correlations, and\ndominated by the intrinsic scatter of $0.5\\,$dex. A tight correlation is also\nfound between the de-projected CO line widths and the stellar velocity\ndispersions averaged within one effective radius. We apply our correlation to\nthe COLD GASS sample to estimate the local SMBH mass function.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Oct 2020 18:01:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-28"}

The near-wall turbulence is significantly weakened and becomes\nintermittent, however relaminarization does not complete. The streamwise\nvelocity profiles deviate above the standard logarithmic law and the Reynolds\nshear stress is reduced. The strong acceleration also suppresses the wall-shear\nnormalized turbulent kinetic energy production rate. At the bump peak, where\nthe FPG switches to an adverse gradient (APG), the near-wall turbulence is\nsuddenly enhanced through a partial retransition process.

In\nCBC searches, reducing contamination by terrestrial and instrumental\ntransients, which create a loud noise background by triggering numerous false\nalarms, is crucial to improving the sensitivity for detecting true events. The\nsheer volume of data and a large number of expected detections also prompts the\nuse of ML techniques. We perform transfer learning to train \"InceptionV3\", a\npre-trained deep neural network, along with curriculum learning to distinguish\nGW signals from noisy events by analysing their continuous wavelet transform\n(CWT) maps.

To resolve this problem, we\npropose a parallel RL scheme for a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) design in a\ncontinuous-time linear MAS. The idea is to exploit the structural properties of\ntwo graphs embedded in the $Q$ and $R$ weighting matrices in the LQR objective\nto define an orthogonal transformation that can convert the original LQR design\nto multiple decoupled smaller-sized LQR designs. We show that if the MAS is\nhomogeneous then this decomposition retains closed-loop optimality. Conditions\nfor decomposability, an algorithm for constructing the transformation matrix, a\nparallel RL algorithm, and robustness analysis when the design is applied to\nnon-homogeneous MAS are presented. Simulations show that the proposed approach\ncan guarantee significant speed-up in learning without any loss in the\ncumulative value of the LQR cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Oct 2020 20:15:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 7 Mar 2021 23:16:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-09"}

Using this Casimir approach, we demonstrate\nself-assembled polaritons by placing an excitonic medium in the microcavity\nregion, as well as observe their laser-induced modulations in and out of the\nstrong coupling regime. These Casimir microcavities can be used as sensitive\nand tunable polaritonic platforms for a variety of applications, including\nopto-mechanics (12), nanomachinery (13), and cavity-induced effects, like\npolaritonic chemistry (14).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Oct 2020 21:23:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-20"}

The tunneling gives a\ntransition of the relative phase of coupled Bose fields from a metastable to a\nstable 'vacuum'. We include finite temperature effects that would be found in a\nlaboratory experiment and also analyze the cut-off dependence of modulational\ninstabilities in Floquet space. Our numerical phase-space model does not use\nthin-wall approximations, which are inapplicable to cosmologically interesting\nmodels. It is expected to give the correct quantum treatment including\nsuperpositions and entanglement during dynamics. By analyzing a nonlocal\nobservable called the topological phase entropy (TPE), our simulations provide\ninformation about phase structure in the true vacuum. We observe a cooperative\neffect in which the true vacua bubbles representing distinct universes each\nhave one or the other of two distinct topologies. The TPE initially increases\nwith time, reaching a peak as the multiple universes are formed, and then\ndecreases with time to the phase-ordered vacuum state. This gives a model for\nthe formation of universes with one of two distinct phases, which is a possible\nsolution to the problem of particle-antiparticle asymmetry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Oct 2020 23:30:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-31"}

It is highly desirable to directly\ntrain a compact neural network from scratch with low memory and low\ncomputational cost. Low-rank tensor decomposition is one of the most effective\napproaches to reduce the memory and computing requirements of large-size neural\nnetworks. However, directly training a low-rank tensorized neural network is a\nvery challenging task because it is hard to determine a proper tensor rank {\\it\na priori}, which controls the model complexity and compression ratio in the\ntraining process. This paper presents a novel end-to-end framework for low-rank\ntensorized training of neural networks. We first develop a flexible Bayesian\nmodel that can handle various low-rank tensor formats (e.g., CP, Tucker, tensor\ntrain and tensor-train matrix) that compress neural network parameters in\ntraining. This model can automatically determine the tensor ranks inside a\nnonlinear forward model, which is beyond the capability of existing Bayesian\ntensor methods. We further develop a scalable stochastic variational inference\nsolver to estimate the posterior density of large-scale problems in training.\nOur work provides the first general-purpose rank-adaptive framework for\nend-to-end tensorized training.

To\nbuild the hierarchy, existing algorithms iteratively follow a\ndelete-update(peeling) process: deleting vertices with the minimum number of\nbutterflies and correspondingly updating the butterfly count of their 2-hop\nneighbors. The need to explore 2-hop neighborhood renders tip-decomposition\ncomputationally very expensive.

(ii) four stationary phase points\nwill appear during asymptotic analysis, which require a more detailed necessary\ndescription to obtain the long-time asymptotics of the focusing FL equation.\nBased on the Riemann-Hilbert problem for the initial value problem of the\nfocusing FL equation, we show that inside any fixed time-spatial cone\n$$\\mathcal{C}\\left(x_{1}, x_{2}, v_{1}, v_{2}\\right)=\\left\\{(x, t) \\in\n\\mathbb{R}^{2} | x=x_{0}+v t, x_{0} \\in\\left[x_{1}, x_{2}\\right], v\n\\in\\left[v_{1}, v_{2}\\right]\\right\\},$$ the long-time asymptotic behavior of\nthe solution $u(x,t)$ for the focusing FL equation can be characterized with an\n$N(\\mathcal{I})$-soliton on discrete spectrums and a leading order term\n$\\mathcal{O}(|t|^{-1/2})$ on continuous spectrum up to a residual error order\n$\\mathcal{O}(|t|^{-3/4})$.

ML inevitably accesses and processes users' personal data, which\ncould potentially breach the relevant privacy protection regulations if not\nperformed carefully. The situation is exacerbated by the cloud-based\nimplementation of digital services when user data are captured and stored in\ndistributed locations, hence aggregation of the user data for ML could be a\nserious breach of privacy regulations. In this backdrop, Federated Learning\n(FL) is an emerging area that allows ML on distributed data without the data\nleaving their stored location.

The planetary signal was observed by several ground-based\ntelescopes, and the planet-host mass ratio is $q = (2.65 \\pm 0.16) \\times\n10^{-3}$. The ground-based observations yield a constraint on the angular\nEinstein radius $\\theta_{\\rm E}$, and the microlensing parallax vector\n$\\vec{\\pi}_{\\rm E}$, is strongly constrained by the Spitzer data. However, the\n2019 Spitzer baseline data reveal systematics in the Spitzer photometry, so\nthere is ambiguity in the magnitude of the parallax. In our preferred\ninterpretation, a full Bayesian analysis using a Galactic model indicates that\nthe planetary system is composed of an $M_{\\rm planet} =\n0.26_{-0.11}^{+0.22}~M_{J}$ planet orbiting an $M_{\\rm host} =\n0.093_{-0.038}^{+0.082}~M_{\\odot}$, at a distance of $D_{\\rm L} =\n3.71_{-1.70}^{+3.24}$ kpc. An alternate interpretation of the data shifts the\nlocalization of the minima along the arc-shaped microlens parallax constraints.\nThis, in turn, yields a more massive host with median mass of $0.13\n{M_{\\odot}}$ at a distance of 6.3 kpc. This analysis demonstrates the\nrobustness of the osculating circles formalism, but shows that further\ninvestigation is needed to assess how systematics affect the specific\nlocalization of the microlens parallax vector and, consequently, the inferred\nphysical parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Oct 2020 07:22:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 20 Jul 2022 08:35:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-21"}

In this work, we present a new method to solve the fluid Poisson\nequation for irrotational/spinning binary neutron stars. The advantage of the\nnew method is that it does not require complex fluid surface fitted coordinates\nand it can be implemented in a Cartesian grid, which is a standard choice in\nnumerical relativity calculations. This is accomplished by employing the source\nterm method proposed by Towers, where the boundary condition is treated as a\njump condition and is incorporated as additional source terms in the Poisson\nequation, which is then solved iteratively. The issue of singular terms caused\nby vanishing density on the surface is resolved with an additional separation\nthat shifts the computation boundary to the interior of the star. We present\ntwo-dimensional tests to show the convergence of the source term method, and we\nfurther apply this solver to a realistic three-dimensional binary neutron star\nproblem.

Researchers incorporate global scene\ncontext into the early layers of deep Convolutional Neural Networks as a\nsolution.

However, this approach leads to the following problems. It increases\nthe network size in the early layers, therefore not efficient. It leads to\nnoisy filter responses when the scene is irrelevant, therefore not accurate. It\nonly leverages scene context whereas human-object interactions offer a\nmultitude of contexts, therefore incomplete. To circumvent these issues, in\nthis work, we propose Self-Selective Context (SSC). SSC operates on the joint\nappearance of human-objects and context to bring the most discriminative\ncontext(s) into play for recognition. We devise novel contextual features that\nmodel the locality of human-object interactions and show that SSC can\nseamlessly integrate with the State-of-the-art interaction recognition models.\nOur experiments show that SSC leads to an important increase in interaction\nrecognition performance, while using much fewer parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Oct 2020 09:06:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-20"}

Here, we perform an in-depth study of a\nsimple yet canonical problem that captures the essence of contact between\nfilaments. In the orthogonal clasp, two filaments are brought into contact,\nwith each centerline lying in one of a pair of orthogonal planes. Our data from\nX-ray tomography (micro-CT) and mechanical testing experiments are in excellent\nagreement with the finite element method (FEM) simulations. Despite the\napparent simplicity of the physical system, the data exhibits strikingly\nunintuitive behavior, even when the contact is frictionless. Specifically, we\nobserve a curvilinear diamond-shaped ridge in the contact pressure field\nbetween the two filaments, sometimes with an inner gap. When a relative\ndisplacement is imposed between the filaments, friction is activated, and a\nhighly asymmetric pressure field develops. These findings contrast to the\nclassic capstan analysis of a single filament wrapped around a rigid body. Both\nthe micro-CT and the FEM data indicate that the cross-sections of the filaments\ncan deform significantly. Nonetheless, an idealized geometrical theory assuming\nundeformable tube cross-sections and neglecting elasticity rationalizes our\nobservations qualitatively and highlights the central role of the small but\nfinite tube radius of the filaments.

However, shared memory frameworks that implement the vertex-centric\ninterface all expose a common tradeoff: programmability against memory\nefficiency and performance.\n  Our approach, iPregel, preserves vertex-centric programmability, while\nimplementing optimisations for performance, and designing these so they are\ntransparent to a user's application code, hence not impacting programmability.\nIn this paper, we evaluate iPregel against FemtoGraph, whose characteristics\nare identical, an asynchronous counterpart GraphChi and the\nvertex-subset-centric framework Ligra. Our experiments include three of the\nmost popular vertex-centric benchmark applications over 4 real-world publicly\naccessible graphs, which cover orders of magnitude between a million to a\nbillion edges, measuring execution time and peak memory usage. Finally, we\nevaluate the programmability of each framework by comparing against Google's\noriginal Pregel framework.\n  Experiments demonstrate that iPregel, like FemtoGraph, does not sacrifice\nvertex-centric programmability for additional performance and memory efficiency\noptimisations, which contrasts against GraphChi and Ligra. Sacrificing\nvertex-centric programmability allowed the latter to benefit from substantial\nperformance and memory efficiency gains. We demonstrate that iPregel is up to\n2300 times faster than FemtoGraph, as well as generating a memory footprint up\nto 100 times smaller. Ligra and GraphChi are up to 17000 and 700 times faster\nthan FemtoGraph but, when comparing against iPregel, this maximum speed-up\ndrops to 10. Furthermore, with PageRank, iPregel is the fastest overall. For\nmemory efficiency, iPregel provides the same memory efficiency as Ligra and 3\nto 6 times lighter than GraphChi on average.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Oct 2020 12:40:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-20"}

Most of iterative algorithms can overcome noise perturbations but\nfail to effectively adapt beyond the noise, e.g. sudden strong perturbations.\nRe-optimizations are usually needed for significant decorrelated medium since\nthese algorithms heavily rely on the optimization in the previous iterations.\nSuch ineffectiveness is probably due to the absence of a metric that can gauge\nthe deviation of the instant wavefront from the optimum compensation based on\nthe concurrently measured optical focusing.

As with other solid shell formulations, only displacement degrees of\nfreedom are required to describe the shell kinematics and general\nthree-dimensional material laws can be adopted. However, the novelty of this\nformulation is the ability to capture complex shell behaviour and avoid locking\nphenomena, without the need to use reduced integration or adopt additional\nnatural strain or enhanced strain fields. Thus, this element is ideally suited\nfor geometrically and physically nonlinear problems. This is achieved by\nconstructing independent approximation shape functions on both the prism\nelement's triangular faces and through the thickness, where the latter is\nassociated with a local coordinate system that convects with deformation of the\nshell. The element is extremely efficient, with the hierarchical property\nlending itself to an efficient and highly scalable multigrid solver, and the\nheterogeneity property enables local p-adaptivity.

With the advancements of deep learning in the domain of natural\nlanguage processing, extracting meaningful information from tweets has become a\ngrowing interest among natural language researchers. Applying existing language\nrepresentation models to extract information from Twitter does not often\nproduce good results. Moreover, there is no existing language representation\nmodels for text analysis specific to the social media domain. Hence, in this\narticle, we introduce two TweetBERT models, which are domain specific language\npresentation models, pre-trained on millions of tweets. We show that the\nTweetBERT models significantly outperform the traditional BERT models in\nTwitter text mining tasks by more than 7% on each Twitter dataset.

We demonstrate the data itself, such as the orientation of images,\nplays a crucial role in disentanglement and instead of the factors, and the\ndisentangled representations align the latent variables with the action\nsequences. We further introduce the concept of disentangling action sequences\nwhich facilitates the description of the behaviours of the existing\ndisentangling approaches. An analogy for this process is to discover the\ncommonality between the things and categorizing them. Furthermore, we analyze\nthe inductive biases on the data and find that the latent information\nthresholds are correlated with the significance of the actions. For the\nsupervised and unsupervised settings, we respectively introduce two methods to\nmeasure the thresholds.

A spoofed\nattack is difficult to detect as a spoofer (attacker who performs spoofing\nattack) can mimic the GNSS signal and transmit inaccurate location coordinates\nto an AV. In this study, we have developed a prediction-based spoofing attack\ndetection strategy using the long short-term memory (LSTM) model, a recurrent\nneural network model. The LSTM model is used to predict the distance traveled\nbetween two consecutive locations of an autonomous vehicle.
