Despite the significance of the LIS\nestimation problem and the amount of attention it has received, there are\nimportant aspects of the problem that are not yet fully understood. There are\nno better lower bounds for LIS estimation than the obvious bounds implied by\ntesting monotonicity (for adaptive or nonadaptive algorithms). In this paper,\nwe give the first nontrivial lower bound on the complexity of LIS estimation,\nand also provide novel algorithms that complement our lower bound.\n  Specifically, for every constant $\\epsilon \\in (0,1)$, every nonadaptive\nalgorithm that outputs an estimate of the length of the LIS in an array of\nlength $n$ to within an additive error of $\\epsilon \\cdot n$ has to make\n$\\log^{\\Omega(\\log (1/\\epsilon))} n)$ queries. Next, we design nonadaptive LIS\nestimation algorithms whose complexity decreases as the the number of distinct\nvalues, $r$, in the array decreases. We first present a simple algorithm that\nmakes $\\tilde{O}(r/\\epsilon^3)$ queries and approximates the LIS length with an\nadditive error bounded by $\\epsilon n$. We then use it to construct a\nnonadaptive algorithm with query complexity $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{r} \\cdot\n\\text{poly}(1/\\lambda))$ that, for an array with LIS length at least $\\lambda\nn$, outputs a multiplicative $\\Omega(\\lambda)$-approximation to the LIS length.\n  Finally, we describe a nonadaptive erasure-resilient tester for sortedness,\nwith query complexity $O(\\log n)$. Our result implies that nonadaptive tolerant\ntesting is strictly harder than nonadaptive erasure-resilient testing for the\nnatural property of monotonicity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Oct 2020 16:01:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Nov 2020 10:05:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 11 Feb 2021 14:54:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-12"}

We propose a magnetohydrodynamic model for\nthe magnetic tail of Uranus at solstice time. One of the main conclusions of\nthe model is that all magnetic field lines forming the extended magnetic tail\nfollow the same qualitative evolution from the time of their emergence through\nthe planet's surface and the time of their late evolution after having been\nstretched and twisted several times downstream of the planet. In the planetary\nframe, these field lines move on magnetic surfaces that wind up to form a\ntornado-shaped vortex with two foot points on the planet (one in each magnetic\nhemisphere).

In the second controller synthesis steps, we develop a\nsystematic approach to compute control barrier functions that explicitly take\ninto consideration the uncertainty of the learned model. The control barrier\nfunction not only results in a safe controller by construction but also\nprovides a rigorous lower bound on the probability of satisfaction of the\nsafety specification. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nresults by synthesizing a safety controller for a jet engine example.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Oct 2020 16:12:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-13"}

The first is the common, well known, cataclysmic variable\n(CV) system in which a main sequence donor star transfers mass to its WD\ncompanion via Roche-lobe overflow. The second is a detached, widely separated,\nsymbiotic system in which an asymptotic giant branch donor star transfers mass\nto its WD companion via strong winds.

For example, finding the best\nmatching product from a large catalog or suggesting related search phrases on a\nsearch engine. The size of the output space for these problems can range from\nmillions to billions, and can even be infinite in some applications. Moreover,\ntraining data is often limited for the long-tail items in the output space.\nFortunately, items in the output space are often correlated thereby presenting\nan opportunity to alleviate the data sparsity issue. In this paper, we propose\nthe Prediction for Enormous and Correlated Output Spaces (PECOS) framework, a\nversatile and modular machine learning framework for solving prediction\nproblems for very large output spaces, and apply it to the eXtreme Multilabel\nRanking (XMR) problem: given an input instance, find and rank the most relevant\nitems from an enormous but fixed and finite output space. We propose a three\nphase framework for PECOS: (i) in the first phase, PECOS organizes the output\nspace using a semantic indexing scheme, (ii) in the second phase, PECOS uses\nthe indexing to narrow down the output space by orders of magnitude using a\nmachine learned matching scheme, and (iii) in the third phase, PECOS ranks the\nmatched items using a final ranking scheme. The versatility and modularity of\nPECOS allows for easy plug-and-play of various choices for the indexing,\nmatching, and ranking phases. We also develop very fast inference procedures\nwhich allow us to perform XMR predictions in real time; for example, inference\ntakes less than 1 millisecond per input on the dataset with 2.8 million labels.\nThe PECOS software is available at https://libpecos.org.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Oct 2020 17:27:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 Jan 2022 19:43:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-20"}

By comparing the\nobservable properties of torsion-hairy black holes to existing observational\ndata on supermassive black holes obtained by the Event Horizon Telescope\ncollaboration, and by the GRAVITY collaboration, we derive constraints on the\ntheory parameters of torsion bigravity. The strongest constraint is found to\ncome from the recent measurement of the periastron precession of the star S2\norbiting the Galactic-center massive black hole [Astron. Astrophys. 636, L5\n(2020)], and to be a thousand times more stringent than solar-system\ngravitational tests.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Oct 2020 16:40:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-09"}

However, theoretical\nmodels still lack to provide an exhaustive explanation for the observed\n$^{14}N/^{15}N$ values.\n  Aims. Recent theoretical works suggest that the $^{14}N/^{15}N$ behaviour is\ndominated by two competing reactions that destroy $ N_2H^+$: dissociative\nrecombination and reaction with CO. When CO is depleted from the gas phase, if\n$N_2H^+$ recombination rate is lower with respect to the $N^{15}NH^+$ one, the\nrarer isotopologue is destroyed faster. This implies that the $N_2H^+$ isotopic\nratio in protostars should be lower than the one in prestellar cores, and\nconsistent with the elemental value of ~440. We aim to test this hypothesis,\nproducing the first sample of $N_2H^+ / N^{15}NH^+$ measurements in low mass\nprotostars.\n  Methods. We observe the $N_2H^+$ and $N^{15}NH^+$ lowest rotational\ntransition towards six young stellar objects in Perseus and Taurus molecular\nclouds. We model the spectra with a custom python code using a constant\n$T_{ex}$ approach to fit the observations. We discuss in appendix the validity\nof this hypothesis. The derived column densities are used to compute the\nnitrogen isotopic ratio.\n  Results. Our analysis yields an average of $\\rm ^{14}N/^{15}N|_{pro} = 420\n\\pm 15$ in the protostellar sample. This is consistent with the protosolar\nvalue of 440, and significantly lower than the average value previously\nobtained in a sample of prestellar objects. Conclusions. Our results are in\nagreement with the hypothesis that, when CO is depleted from the gas-phase,\ndissociative recombinations with free electrons destroy $N^{15}NH^+$ faster\nthan $N_2H^+$, leading to high isotopic ratios in prestellar cores, where CO is\nfrozen on dust grains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Oct 2020 18:27:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-04"}

Mathematical analysis with\nnumerical simulations are presented to show the properties of the statistical\nmodel-based estimation framework and to reveal its connection to existing\nlow-pass filters. Furthermore, a new paradigm is developed for robots\nobservability analysis by developing Lie derivatives and associated partial\ndifferentiation directly on manifolds.

This form of collaborative\nlearning exposes new tradeoffs among model convergence speed, model accuracy,\nbalance across clients, and communication cost, with new challenges including:\n(1) straggler problem, where the clients lag due to data or (computing and\nnetwork) resource heterogeneity, and (2) communication bottleneck, where a\nlarge number of clients communicate their local updates to a central server and\nbottleneck the server. Many existing FL methods focus on optimizing along only\none dimension of the tradeoff space. Existing solutions use asynchronous model\nupdating or tiering-based synchronous mechanisms to tackle the straggler\nproblem. However, the asynchronous methods can easily create a network\ncommunication bottleneck, while tiering may introduce biases as tiering favors\nfaster tiers with shorter response latencies. To address these issues, we\npresent FedAT, a novel Federated learning method with Asynchronous Tiers under\nNon-i.i.d. data. FedAT synergistically combines synchronous intra-tier training\nand asynchronous cross-tier training. By bridging the synchronous and\nasynchronous training through tiering, FedAT minimizes the straggler effect\nwith improved convergence speed and test accuracy. FedAT uses a\nstraggler-aware, weighted aggregation heuristic to steer and balance the\ntraining for further accuracy improvement. FedAT compresses the uplink and\ndownlink communications using an efficient, polyline-encoding-based compression\nalgorithm, therefore minimizing the communication cost. Results show that FedAT\nimproves the prediction performance by up to 21.09%, and reduces the\ncommunication cost by up to 8.5x, compared to state-of-the-art FL methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Oct 2020 18:38:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 29 Aug 2021 02:45:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-31"}

Specifically, we use the\nBacon-Shor codes and perfect tensors to construct a gauge code (or a stabilizer\ncode with gauge-fixing), which we call the holographic hybrid code. This code\nadmits a local log-depth encoding/decoding circuit, and can be represented as a\nholographic tensor network which satisfies an analog of the Ryu-Takayanagi\nformula and reproduces features of the sub-region duality. We then construct\napproximate versions of the holographic hybrid codes by \"skewing\" the code\nsubspace, where the size of skewing is analogous to the size of the\ngravitational constant in holography. These approximate hybrid codes are not\nnecessarily stabilizer codes, but they can be expressed as the superposition of\nholographic tensor networks that are stabilizer codes. For such constructions,\ndifferent logical states, representing different bulk matter content, can\n\"back-react\" on the emergent geometry, resembling a key feature of gravity. The\nlocality of the bulk degrees of freedom becomes subspace-dependent and\napproximate. Such subspace-dependence is manifest from the point of view of the\n\"entanglement wedge\" and bulk operator reconstruction from the boundary. Exact\ncomplementary error correction breaks down for certain bipartition of the\nboundary degrees of freedom; however, a limited, state-dependent form is\npreserved for particular subspaces. We also construct an example where the\nconnected two-point correlation functions can have a power-law decay.

The implied metal-rich environment at\nthe Sun's birthplace and formation time is supported by measured silicon\nisotopic ratios in presolar silicon carbide grains. We perform numerical\nsimulations of the dynamical evolution of disk stars in a Milky Way-like galaxy\nto identify the lifetime trajectory of the solar system. We find that a solar\nsystem born in the proximity of the Galactic bulge could travel to the current\nlocus by the effect of radial migration induced by several major encounters\nwith spiral arms.

The approach allows generating destruction data with unprecedented\nscope, resolution, and frequency - only limited by the available satellite\nimagery - which can alleviate data limitations decisively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Oct 2020 19:01:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Oct 2020 03:47:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-07"}

This procedure is often used to\nautomate the design of devices involving flow through porous media, such as\nmicro-fluidic devices. TopOpt offers material layouts that control the flow of\nfluids through porous materials, providing desired functionalities. Many prior\nstudies in this application area have used Darcy equations for primal analysis\nand the minimum power theorem (MPT) to drive the optimization problem. But both\nthese choices (Darcy equations and MPT) are restrictive and not valid for\ngeneral working conditions of modern devices. Being simple and linear, Darcy\nequations are often used to model flow of fluids through porous media. However,\ntwo inherent assumptions of the Darcy model are: the viscosity of a fluid is a\nconstant, and inertial effects are negligible. There is irrefutable\nexperimental evidence that viscosity of a fluid, especially organic liquids,\ndepends on the pressure. Given the typical small pore-sizes, inertial effects\nare dominant in micro-fluidic devices. Next, MPT is not a general principle and\nis not valid for (nonlinear) models that relax the assumptions of the Darcy\nmodel. This paper aims to overcome the mentioned deficiencies by presenting a\ngeneral strategy for using TopOpt. First, we will consider nonlinear models\nthat take into account the pressure-dependent viscosity and inertial effects,\nand study the effect of these nonlinearities on the optimal material layouts\nunder TopOpt. Second, we will explore the rate of mechanical dissipation, valid\neven for nonlinear models, as an alternative for the objective function. Third,\nwe will present analytical solutions of optimal designs for canonical problems;\nthese solutions not only possess research and pedagogical values but also\nfacilitate verification of computer implementations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Oct 2020 19:37:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 30 May 2021 21:20:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-01"}

However, Italy has been characterized by a high variety of\ndialects, which are often loosely related to each other, due to the past\nfragmentation of the territory.

Each composition is associated to its author, and authors are also\ngrouped in families, i.e. sharing similar stylistic/chronological\ncharacteristics. Hence, the dataset is not only a valuable resource for\nstudying the diachronic evolution of Italian and the differences between its\ndialects, but it is also useful to investigate stylistic aspects between single\nauthors.

In some radio AGN, they are likely the result of the radio jets\ninteracting with the interstellar medium. We have used a global VLBI array to\nmap the HI outflow in a small sample of young and restarted radio galaxies\nwhich we previously observed with the VLA and the WSRT at lower resolution.\nHere, we report on our findings for 4C52.37 and 3C293 and we discuss the sample\nincluding the previously published sources 4C12.50 and 3C236.

The\nclouds are blue-shifted by up to 600km/s with respect to the systemic velocity.\n3C293 is largely resolved out in our VLBI observation, but we detect, towards\nthe VLBI core, some outflowing HI gas blueshifted with respect to the systemic\nvelocity by up to 300km/s. We also find indications that the HI outflow is\nextended. Overall, we find that the fraction of HI gas recovered by our VLBI\nobservation varies significantly within our sample. In all cases we find\nevidence for a clumpy structure of both the outflowing and the quiescent gas,\nconsistent with predictions from numerical simulations. The outflows include at\nleast a component of relatively compact clouds (10^4-10^5Msun) often observed\nalready at a few tens of pc (in projection) from the core.

This is a rich\nfamily of graphs, containing all graphs without a fixed minor (e.g. planar\ngraphs), as well as graphs generated by various random processes (e.g.\npreferential attachment graphs). We say that $H$ is easy if there is a\nlinear-time algorithm for counting the number of copies of $H$ in an input $G$\nof bounded degeneracy. A seminal result of Chiba and Nishizeki from '85 states\nthat every $H$ on at most 4 vertices is easy.

For\nreliable communication, routing plays an important role, which establishes a\npath between source and destination on the basis of certain criteria.\nConventional routing protocols of FANET generally use a minimum hop count\ncriterion to find the best route between source and destination, which results\nin lower latency with the consideration that there is single source/destination\nnetwork environment. However, in a network with multiple sources, the minimum\nhop count routing criterion along with the 1-Hop HELLO messages broadcasted by\neach node in the network may deteriorate the network performance in terms of\nhigh End-to-End (ETE) delay and decrease in the lifetime of the network. This\nresearch work proposes a Reliable link-adaptive position-based routing protocol\n(RLPR) for FANET. It uses relative speed, signal strength, and energy of the\nnodes along with the geographic distance towards the destination using a\nforwarding angle. This angle is used to determine the forwarding zone that\ndecreases the undesirable control messages in the network in order to discover\nthe route. RLPR enhances the network performance by selecting those relay nodes\nwhich are in the forwarding zone and whose geographic movement is towards the\ndestination. Additionally, RLPR selects the next hop with better energy level\nand uses signal strength and relative speed of the nodes to achieve high\nconnectivity-level. Based on the performance evaluation performed in the\nNetwork simulator (ns-2.35), it has been analysed that RLPR outperforms the\nRobust and reliable predictive based routing (RARP) and Ad hoc on-demand\ndistance vector (AODV) protocols in different scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Oct 2020 20:17:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-14"}

The perturbation introduces dissipation\nand contains an adjustable parameter. By choosing the adjustable parameter, one\ncan ensure that the torus persists under perturbation. Such models are common\nin celestial mechanics. In field theory, the adjustable parameter is called the\ncounterterm and in celestial mechanics, the drift. It is known that there are\nformal expansions in powers of the perturbation both for the quasi-periodic\nsolution and the counterterm.\n  We prove that the asymptotic expansions for the quasiperiodic solutions and\nthe counterterm satisfy Gevrey estimates. That is, the $n$-th term of the\nexpansion is bounded by a power of $n!$. The Gevrey class (the power of $n!$)\ndepends only on the Diophantine condition of the frequency and the order of the\nfriction coefficient in powers of the perturbative parameter.\n  The method of proof we introduce may be of interest beyond the problem\nconsidered here. We consider a modified Newton method in a space of power\nexpansions. As it is custumary in KAM theory, each step of the method is\nestimated in a smaller domain. In contrast with the KAM results, the domains\nwhere we control the Newton method shrink very fast and the Newton method does\nnot prove that the solutions are analytic. On the other hand, by examining\ncarefully the process, we can obtain estimates on the coefficients of the\nexpansions and conclude the series are Gevrey.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Oct 2020 20:18:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-14"}

The model is entirely\ngeometry-based (no mesh prerequisite) with distinct segments assembled together\nusing surface-based tie constraints, and thus requires no element partitioning\nor enrichment.

This makes the development of new\ndata-driven methods for the discovery of patterns among multiple lengthscales\nand time-scales and structure-property relationships essential. These\ndata-driven approaches show enormous promise within materials science. The\nfollowing review covers machine learning applications for metallic material\ncharacterization. Many parameters associated with the processing and the\nstructure of materials affect the properties and the performance of\nmanufactured components. Thus, this study is an attempt to investigate the\nusefulness of machine learning methods for material property prediction.\nMaterial characteristics such as strength, toughness, hardness, brittleness or\nductility are relevant to categorize a material or component according to their\nquality. In industry, material tests like tensile tests, compression tests or\ncreep tests are often time consuming and expensive to perform. Therefore, the\napplication of machine learning approaches is considered helpful for an easier\ngeneration of material property information. This study also gives an\napplication of machine learning methods on small punch test data for the\ndetermination of the property ultimate tensile strength for various materials.\nA strong correlation between small punch test data and tensile test data was\nfound which ultimately allows to replace more costly tests by simple and fast\ntests in combination with machine learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Oct 2020 20:30:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-14"}

We analyze variants of the Exp3 algorithm that tune their step-size\nusing only information (about the losses and delays) available at the time of\nthe decisions, and obtain regret guarantees that adapt to the observed (rather\nthan the worst-case) sequences of delays and/or losses. First, through a\nremarkably simple proof technique, we show that with proper tuning of the step\nsize, the algorithm achieves an optimal (up to logarithmic factors) regret of\norder $\\sqrt{\\log(K)(TK + D)}$ both in expectation and in high probability,\nwhere $K$ is the number of arms, $T$ is the time horizon, and $D$ is the\ncumulative delay. The high-probability version of the bound, which is the first\nhigh-probability delay-adaptive bound in the literature, crucially depends on\nthe use of implicit exploration in estimating the losses. Then, following\nZimmert and Seldin [2019], we extend these results so that the algorithm can\n\"skip\" rounds with large delays, resulting in regret bounds of order\n$\\sqrt{TK\\log(K)} + |R| + \\sqrt{D_{\\bar{R}}\\log(K)}$, where $R$ is an arbitrary\nset of rounds (which are skipped) and $D_{\\bar{R}}$ is the cumulative delay of\nthe feedback for other rounds. Finally, we present another, data-adaptive\n(AdaGrad-style) version of the algorithm for which the regret adapts to the\nobserved (delayed) losses instead of only adapting to the cumulative delay\n(this algorithm requires an a priori upper bound on the maximum delay, or the\nadvance knowledge of the delay for each decision when it is made). The\nresulting bound can be orders of magnitude smaller on benign problems, and it\ncan be shown that the delay only affects the regret through the loss of the\nbest arm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Oct 2020 20:53:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-14"}

An important open problem in\nthe study of infinite type surfaces is to describe the boundary of the loop\ngraph as a space of geodesic laminations.

Four tables summarise their\nfindings: study details (aim, population, interventions, comparisons, methods\nand outcomes), data details (size, type, modalities, annotation, balance,\navailability and language of study), methodology (pre-processing, feature\ngeneration, machine learning, evaluation and results) and clinical\napplicability (research implications, clinical potential, risk of bias and\nstrengths/limitations). While promising results are reported across nearly all\n51 studies, very few have been implemented in clinical research or practice. We\nconcluded that the main limitations of the field are poor standardisation,\nlimited comparability of results, and a degree of disconnect between study aims\nand clinical applications. Attempts to close these gaps should support\ntranslation of future research into clinical practice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Oct 2020 21:43:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-14"}

But once a relevant system is found, such rapid disruption and\nrearrangement would be very likely to destroy the system before much evolution\ncould take place. In this paper we explore the possibility, using a model\ndeveloped previously, that the search process could occur under different\nenvironmental conditions than the subsequent fixation and growth of a lifelike\nchemical system. We use the example of a rapid change in temperature to\nillustrate the effect and refer to the rapid change as a `quench' borrowing\nterminology from study of the physics and chemistry of glass formation. The\nmodel study shows that interrupting a high temperature nonequilibrium state\nwith a rapid quench to lower temperatures can substantially increase the\nprobability of producing a chemical state with lifelike characteristics of\nnonequilibrium metastability, internal dynamics and exponential population\ngrowth in time. Previously published data on the length distributions of\nproteomes of prokaryotes may be consistent with such an idea and suggest a\nprebiotic high temperature `search' phase near the boiling point of water. A\nrapid change in pH could have a similar effect. We discuss possible scenarios\non early earth which might have allowed frequent quenches of the sort\nconsidered here to have occurred.

Being able to automatically classify these images is a\nlong-standing problem in astronomy and critical to a number of different\nscientific analyses. Recently, the challenge of \"star-galaxy\" classification\nhas been approached with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), which are good at\nlearning complex nonlinear embeddings. However, DNNs are known to\noverconfidently extrapolate on unseen data and require a large volume of\ntraining images that accurately capture the data distribution to be considered\nreliable.

First, the principal components obtain information by\ntransforming it to column vectors (which we call the amalgamated view), which\nincurs the loss of the spatial information in the data. Second, the generalized\nspatial pooling utilized in the PCANet induces feature redundancy and also\nfails to accommodate spatial statistics of natural images.

Therefore, these symptoms\nare often overlooked, making diagnosis of PD at an early stage challenging.

However, it is difficult to\nobtain massive amounts of annotated training data required by the deep-learning\nmodels as the manual delineation process is often tedious and expertise\nrequired. Although self-supervised learning (SSL) scheme has been widely\nadopted to address this problem, most SSL methods focus only on global\nstructure information, ignoring the key distinguishing features of tumor\nregions: local intensity variation and large size distribution. In this paper,\nwe propose Scale-Aware Restoration (SAR), a SSL method for 3D tumor\nsegmentation. Specifically, a novel proxy task, i.e. scale discrimination, is\nformulated to pre-train the 3D neural network combined with the\nself-restoration task.

Currently, object recognition\nis performed based mostly on visual information. Some robots use also 3D\ninformation such as point clouds or laser scans but, to the knowledge of\nauthors, robots don't use physical properties to improve object recognition.\nEstimation of an object's weight during a manipulation task is something new in\nthe @Home league and such ability can improve performance of domestic service\nrobots. In this work we propose to estimate the weight of the grasped object\nusing Sliding Mode Observers. If we consider the manipulator without load as\nthe nominal system and object's weight as a fault signal, we can estimate such\nweight by an appropriate filtering of the output error injection term of the\nsliding mode observer. To implement our proposal we used MATLAB and Simulink\nRobotics System Toolbox, ROS Toolbox and Simscape. To improve computation time\nwe exported all algorithms to standalone ROS nodes from Simulink models. Tests\nwere performed using two platforms: Justina's left manipulator (a robot\ndeveloped at Biorobotics Laboratory, UNAM) and Neuronics Katana manipulators.\nWe present results in simulation and discuss the performance of the proposed\nsystem and the possible sources of error.

Inspired by human's ability to\nboth be aware of distance and direction of self-motion in navigation, our\ntrajectory learning method learns a pattern representation of trajectories\nencoded as a sequence of distances and turning angles to assist\nself-localization. We pose the learning process as a conditional sequence\nprediction problem in which each output locates the object on a traversable\npath in a map. Considering the prediction sequence ought to be topologically\nconnected in the graph-structured map, we adopt two different hypotheses\ngeneration and elimination strategies to eliminate disconnected sequence\nprediction. We demonstrate our approach on the KITTI stereo visual odometry\ndataset which is a city-scale environment and can generate trajectory with\nmetric information. The key benefits of our approach to geolocalization are\nthat 1) we take advantage of powerful sequence modeling ability of recurrent\nneural network and its robustness to noisy input, 2) only require a map in the\nform of a graph and simply use an affordable sensor that generates motion\ntrajectory and 3) do not need initial position. The experiments show that the\nmotion trajectories can be learned by training an recurrent neural network, and\ntemporally consistent geolocation can be predicted with both of the proposed\nstrategies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 02:08:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-14"}

To generate sparse perturbations, sparse attacks have been\nrecently developed, which are usually independent attacks derived by modifying\na dense attack's algorithm with sparsity regularisations, resulting in reduced\nattack efficiency. In this paper, we aim to tackle this task from a different\nperspective.

Of particular interest is the topological\nphase transition, such as in the XY model, which can be difficult for\nunsupervised learning such as the principal component analysis. Recently,\nauthors of [Nature Physics \\textbf{15},790 (2019)] employed the diffusion-map\nmethod for identifying topological order and were able to determine the BKT\nphase transition of the XY model, specifically via the intersection of the\naverage cluster distance $\\bar{D}$ and the within cluster dispersion\n$\\bar\\sigma$ (when the different clusters vary from separation to mixing\ntogether). However, sometimes it is not easy to find the intersection if\n$\\bar{D}$ or $\\bar{\\sigma}$ does not change too much due to topological\nconstraint. In this paper, we propose to use the Calinski-Harabaz ($ch$) index,\ndefined roughly as the ratio $\\bar D/\\bar \\sigma$, to determine the critical\npoints, at which the $ch$ index reaches a maximum or minimum value, or jump\nsharply. We examine the $ch$ index in several statistical models, including\nones that contain a BKT phase transition. For the Ising model, the peaks of the\nquantity $ch$ or its components are consistent with the position of the\nspecific heat maximum. For the XY model both on the square lattices and\nhoneycomb lattices, our results of the $ch$ index show the convergence of the\npeaks over a range of the parameters $\\varepsilon/\\varepsilon_0$ in the\nGaussian kernel. We also examine the generalized XY model with $q=2$ and $q=8$\nand at the value away from the pure XY limit. Our method is thus useful to both\ntopological and non-topological phase transitions and can achieve accuracy as\ngood as supervised learning methods previously used in these models, and may be\nused for searching phases from experimental data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 03:13:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-27"}

One of the main challenges in studying\nexperimentally Anderson like localized states resides in the difficulty to\nexcite these states independently and observe them individually anywhere in the\nsample. The modes mutual interaction and their coupling to the sample\nboundaries makes it extremely challenging to isolate them spectrally and image\nthem alone. In the presence of gain, random lasing occurs above threshold and\nlasing modes are excited. It was shown recently that shaping the intensity\nprofile of the optical pump is a very effective way to control and force random\nlasing in singlemode regime at any desired emission wavelength. Active random\nmedia therefore offer a unique platform to select modes individually. By using\npump shaping technique in a strongly scattering random laser, we successfully\nselect localized lasing modes individually. Direct imaging of the light\ndistribution within the random laser confirms the confined nature of the modes\nand enables us to elucidate long standing questions on the role of\nnon-Hermiticity in active scattering media and the influence of nonlinearities\non Anderson wave localization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 04:54:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-14"}

Most of the existing works focus on\nstatic demands, however, here, data at each sBS is considered to be correlated\nacross time and sBSs. The caching strategy is assumed to be a weighted\ncombination of past caching strategies. A high probability generalization\nguarantees on the performance of the proposed caching strategy is derived.

Drive-thru\nrecommendation systems allow restaurants to display food recommendations on the\ndigital menu board as guests are making their orders. Popular recommendation\nmodels in eCommerce scenarios rely on user attributes (such as user profiles or\npurchase history) to generate recommendations, while such information is hard\nto obtain in the drive-thru use case. Thus, in this paper, we propose a new\nrecommendation model Transformer Cross Transformer (TxT), which exploits the\nguest order behavior and contextual features (such as location, time, and\nweather) using Transformer encoders for drive-thru recommendations. Empirical\nresults show that our TxT model achieves superior results in Burger King's\ndrive-thru production environment compared with existing recommendation\nsolutions.

By the GLT\ntheory one can derive a function, which describes the singular value or the\neigenvalue distribution of the sequence, the latter under precise assumptions.\nHowever, for small values of the matrix size of the considered sequence, the\napproximations may not be as good as it is desirable, since in the construction\nof the GLT symbol one disregards small norm and low-rank perturbations. On the\nother hand, LFA can be used to construct polynomial symbols in a similar manner\nfor discretizations, where the geometric information is present, but the small\nnorm perturbations are retained. The main focus of this paper is the\nintroduction of the concept of sequence of \"Toeplitz momentary symbols\",\nassociated with a given sequence of truncated Toeplitz-like matrices. We\nconstruct the symbol in the same way as in the GLT theory, but we keep the\ninformation of the small norm contributions. The low-rank contributions are\nstill disregarded, and we give an idea on the reason why this is negligible in\ncertain cases and why it is not in other cases, being aware that in presence of\nhigh nonnormality the same low-rank perturbation can produce a dramatic change\nin the eigenvalue distribution. Moreover, a difference with respect to the LFA\nsymbols is that GLT symbols and Toeplitz momentary symbols are more general and\nare applicable to a larger class of matrices. We show the applicability of the\napproach which leads to higher accuracy in some cases when compared with the\nGLT symbol.

The isospin non-conservation affects broad\nrange of observables from superallowed Fermi weak interaction to\nisospin-forbidden electromagnetic rates. Its most profound and cleanest\nmanifestation are systematic shifts in masses and excitation energies of mirror\natomic nuclei.\n  Purpose: Recently, we constructed the charge-dependent DFT that includes\nclass II and III local interactions and demonstrated that the model allows for\nvery accurate reproduction of Mirror and Triplet Displacement energies in a\nvery broad range of masses.

These distribution discrepancies could lead the deep\nnetworks to over-fit on the training datasets and lack generalization ability\non the unseen test datasets.

Our DoFE framework dynamically enriches\nthe image features with additional domain prior knowledge learned from\nmulti-source domains to make the semantic features more discriminative.\nSpecifically, we introduce a Domain Knowledge Pool to learn and memorize the\nprior information extracted from multi-source domains. Then the original image\nfeatures are augmented with domain-oriented aggregated features, which are\ninduced from the knowledge pool based on the similarity between the input image\nand multi-source domain images. We further design a novel domain code\nprediction branch to infer this similarity and employ an attention-guided\nmechanism to dynamically combine the aggregated features with the semantic\nfeatures. We comprehensively evaluate our DoFE framework on two fundus image\nsegmentation tasks, including the optic cup and disc segmentation and vessel\nsegmentation. Our DoFE framework generates satisfying segmentation results on\nunseen datasets and surpasses other domain generalization and network\nregularization methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 07:28:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-14"}

The first part of the paper applies time-domain\nmethods, to derive for a first time, equivalent sequential characterizations of\nthe Cover and Pombra characterization of feedback capacity of AGN channels\ndriven by nonstationary and nonergodic Gaussian noise. The optimal channel\ninput processes of the new equivalent sequential characterizations are\nexpressed as functionals of a sufficient statistic and a Gaussian orthogonal\ninnovations process. From the new representations follows that the Cover and\nPombra $n-$block capacity formula is expressed as a functional of two\ngeneralized matrix difference Riccati equations (DRE) of filtering theory of\nGaussian systems, contrary to results that appeared in the literature. In the\nsecond part of the paper the existence of the asymptotic limit of the $n-$block\nfeedback capacity formula is shown to be equivalent to the convergence\nproperties of solutions of the two generalized DREs. Further, necessary and or\nsufficient conditions are identified for existence of the asymptotic limits,\nfor stable and unstable Gaussian noise, when the optimal input distributions\nare time-invariant, but not necessarily stationary. The paper contains an in\ndepth analysis, with examples, of the specific technical issues, which are\noverlooked in past literature [3-7], that studied the AGN channel of [2], for\nstationary noises.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 08:20:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-14"}

Among other methods, the finite\ndifference method is widely used in classic normal mode programs. In many\nrecent studies, the spectral method has been used for discretization. It is\ngenerally more accurate than the finite difference method. However, the\nspectral method requires that the variables to be solved are continuous in\nspace, and the traditional spectral method is powerless for a layered marine\nenvironment. A Chebyshev-Tau spectral method based on domain decomposition is\napplied to the construction of underwater acoustic normal modes in this paper.\nIn this method, the differential equation is projected onto spectral space from\nthe original physical space with the help of an orthogonal basis of Chebyshev\npolynomials. A complex matrix eigenvalue / eigenvector problem is thus formed,\nfrom which the solution of horizontal wavenumbers and modal functions can be\nsolved. The validity of the acoustic field calculation is tested in comparison\nwith classic programs. The results of analysis and tests show that compared\nwith the classic finite difference method, the proposed Chebyshev-Tau spectral\nmethod has the advantage of high computational accuracy.

However, current in-vitro test and\nanalysis methods are still lacking standardization and comparability, which\nimpedes advances in material design. For example, the optical platelet analysis\nof material in-vitro hemocompatibility tests is carried out manually or\nsemi-manually by each research group individually.\n  As a step towards standardization, this paper proposes an automation approach\nfor the optical platelet count and analysis. To this end, fluorescence images\nare segmented using Zach's convexification of the multiphase-phase piecewise\nconstant Mumford--Shah model. The resulting connected components of the\nnon-background segments then need to be classified as platelet or no platelet.\nTherefore, a supervised random forest is applied to feature vectors derived\nfrom the components using features like area, perimeter and circularity. With\nan overall high accuracy and low error rates, the random forest achieves\nreliable results. This is supported by high areas under the receiver-operator\nand the prediction-recall curve, respectively.\n  We developed a new method for a fast, user-independent and reproducible\nanalysis of material hemocompatibility tests, which is therefore a unique and\npowerful tool for advances in biomaterial research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 09:13:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-14"}

Extractive approaches are widely used in\ntext summarization because of their fluency and efficiency.

They also often ignore the effect of topical\ninformation on capturing important contents. To address these issues, this\npaper proposes a graph neural network (GNN)-based extractive summarization\nmodel, enabling to capture inter-sentence relationships efficiently via\ngraph-structured document representation. Moreover, our model integrates a\njoint neural topic model (NTM) to discover latent topics, which can provide\ndocument-level features for sentence selection. The experimental results\ndemonstrate that our model not only substantially achieves state-of-the-art\nresults on CNN/DM and NYT datasets but also considerably outperforms existing\napproaches on scientific paper datasets consisting of much longer documents,\nindicating its better robustness in document genres and lengths.

We investigate how\nthe bombardment by planetesimals left-over from the terrestrial planet region\nafter terrestrial planet formation, as well as asteroids and comets, affects\nthe evolution of Earth's early atmosphere. We develop a new statistical code of\nstochastic bombardment for atmosphere evolution, combining prescriptions for\natmosphere loss and volatile delivery derived from hydrodynamic simulations and\ntheory with results from dynamical modelling of realistic populations of\nimpactors. We find that for an initially Earth-like atmosphere impacts cause\nmoderate atmospheric erosion with stochastic delivery of large asteroids giving\nsubstantial growth ($\\times 10$) in a few $\\%$ of cases. The exact change in\natmosphere mass is inherently stochastic and dependent on the dynamics of the\nleft-over planetesimals.

Remarkably, for a wide range of initial atmosphere masses and\ncompositions, the atmosphere converges towards similar final masses and\ncompositions, i.e. initially low mass atmospheres grow whereas massive\natmospheres deplete. While the final properties are sensitive to the assumed\nimpactor properties, the resulting atmosphere mass is close to that of current\nEarth. The exception to this is that a large initial atmosphere cannot be\neroded to the current mass unless the atmosphere was initially primordial in\ncomposition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 09:34:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-21"}

The\nlarge bandwidth covers the regimes of both diffusive and ballistic intraband\nelectron transport and, thus, allows us to separate extrinsic and intrinsic AMR\ncomponents. Analysis of the THz response based on Boltzmann transport theory\nreveals that the AMR of the Ni, Ni81Fe19 and Ni50Fe50 samples is of\npredominantly extrinsic nature. However, the Co thin film exhibits a sizeable\nintrinsic AMR contribution, which is constant up to 28 THz and amounts to more\nthan 2/3 of the DC AMR contrast of 1%. These features are attributed to the\nhexagonal structure of the Co crystallites. They are interesting for\napplications in terahertz spintronics and terahertz photonics.

Including partial ionisation leads to a\nfinite-width existing for shocks, where the ionised and neutral species\ndecouple and recouple. As such, drift velocities exist within the shock that\nlead to frictional heating between the two species, in addition to the\nadiabatic temperature changes across the shock. The local temperature\nenhancements within the shock alter the recombination and ionisation rates and\nhence change the composition of the plasma. We study the role of collisional\nionisation and recombination in slow-mode partially-ionised shocks. In\nparticular we incorporate the ionisation potential energy loss and analyse the\nconsequences of having a non-conservative energy equation. A semi-analytical\napproach is used to determine the possible equilibrium shock jumps for a\ntwo-fluid model with ionisation, recombination, ionisation potential and\narbitrary heating. Two-fluid numerical simulations are performed using the\n(P\\underline{I}P) code. Results are compared to the MHD model and semi-analytic\nsolution. Accounting for ionisation, recombination and ionisation potential\nsignificantly alters the behaviour of shocks in both substructure and\npost-shock regions. In particular, for a given temperature, equilibrium can\nonly exist for specific densities due to the radiative losses needing to be\nbalanced by the heating function. A consequence of the ionisation potential is\nthat a compressional shock will lead to a reduction of temperature in the\npost-shock region, rather than the increase seen for MHD. The numerical\nsimulations pair well with the derived analytic model for shock velocities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 11:40:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-20"}

Many data science problems have been reduced into ASD\nthrough ingenious modelling. For ASD, the so-called Jacobi-like methods have\nbeen extensively used. However, the methods have no guarantee to suppress the\nmagnitude of off-diagonal entries of the transformed tuple even if the given\ntuple has a common exact diagonalizer, i.e., the given tuple is simultaneously\ndiagonalizable. In this paper, to establish an alternative powerful strategy\nfor ASD, we present a novel two-step strategy, called\nApproximate-Then-Diagonalize-Simultaneously (ATDS) algorithm. The ATDS\nalgorithm decomposes ASD into (Step 1) finding a simultaneously diagonalizable\ntuple near the given one; and (Step 2) finding a common similarity\ntransformation which diagonalizes exactly the tuple obtained in Step 1. The\nproposed approach to Step 1 is realized by solving a Structured Low-Rank\nApproximation (SLRA) with Cadzow's algorithm. In Step 2, by exploiting the idea\nin the constructive proof regarding the conditions for the exact simultaneous\ndiagonalizability, we obtain a common exact diagonalizer of the obtained tuple\nin Step 1 as a solution for the original ASD. Unlike the Jacobi-like methods,\nthe ATDS algorithm has a guarantee to find a common exact diagonalizer if the\ngiven tuple happens to be simultaneously diagonalizable.

This poses the natural parameterized\ncomplexity question what happens when the input is \"almost\" acyclic.

To obtain a reliable and statistically robust\npicture of the rotational profile, we used a set of simultaneous 400-day long\nspectral line intensities of five different spectral lines: O VI 1032 A, O VI\n1037 A, Si XII 499 A, Si XII 521 A, and H I 1216 A, which are routinely\nobserved by UVCS. The data were analyzed by means of two different techniques:\nthe generalized Lomb-Scargle periodogram (GLS) and a multivariate data-adaptive\ntechnique called multichannel singular spectrum analysis (MSSA). Among many\nother positive outcomes, this latter method is unique in its ability to\nrecognize common oscillatory modes between the five time series observed at\nboth limbs. The latitudinal rotation profile obtained in this work emphasizes\nthat the low-latitude region of the UV corona (about $\\pm 20^{\\circ}$ from the\nsolar equator) exhibits differential rotation, while the higher-latitude\nstructures do rotate quasi-rigidly. The differential rotation rate of the solar\ncorona as evinced at low-latitudes is consistent with the rotational profile of\nthe near-surface convective zone of the Sun, suggesting that the rotation of\nthe corona at 1.7 $R_{\\odot}$ is linked to intermediate-scale magnetic bipole\nstructures anchored near 0.99 $R_{\\odot}$. The quasi-rigid rotation rate found\nat mid and high latitudes is instead attributed to the influence of large-scale\ncoronal structures linked to the rigidly rotating coronal holes. We further\nsuggest that the methodology presented in this paper could represent a\nmilestone for future investigations on differential rotation rates when dealing\nwith simultaneous multiwavelength data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 13:10:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-25"}

People often use a variety of body language to express\nemotions, and it is difficult to enumerate all emotional body gestures and\ncollect enough samples for each category. Therefore, recognizing new emotional\nbody gestures is critical for better understanding human emotions. However, the\nexisting methods fail to accurately determine which emotional state a new body\ngesture belongs to. In order to solve this problem, we introduce a Generalized\nZero-Shot Learning (GZSL) framework, which consists of three branches to infer\nthe emotional state of the new body gestures with only their semantic\ndescriptions. The first branch is a Prototype-Based Detector (PBD) which is\nused to determine whether an sample belongs to a seen body gesture category and\nobtain the prediction results of the samples from the seen categories. The\nsecond branch is a Stacked AutoEncoder (StAE) with manifold regularization,\nwhich utilizes semantic representations to predict samples from unseen\ncategories. Note that both of the above branches are for body gesture\nrecognition. We further add an emotion classifier with a softmax layer as the\nthird branch in order to better learn the feature representations for this\nemotion classification task. The input features for these three branches are\nlearned by a shared feature extraction network, i.e., a Bidirectional Long\nShort-Term Memory Networks (BLSTM) with a self-attention module. We treat these\nthree branches as subtasks and use multi-task learning strategies for joint\ntraining.

ALMA\nintensity data at mm-wavelengths are used for a first detailed systematic\nassessment of the occurrence and properties of small-scale dynamical features\nin the quiet Sun. ALMA Band 3 data (~ $3$ mm / $100$ GHz) with spatial\nresolution ~ $1.4$ - $2.1$ arcsec and a duration of ~ $40$ min are analysed\ntogether with SDO/HMI magnetograms. The temporal evolution of the mm-maps is\nstudied to detect pronounced dynamical features which are connected to\ndynamical events via a k-means clustering algorithm. The physical properties of\nthe resulting events are studied and it is explored if they show properties\nconsistent with propagating shock waves. For this purpose, observable shock\nwave signatures at mm wavelengths are calculated from one- and\nthree-dimensional model atmospheres. There are 552 dynamical events detected\nwith an excess in brightness temperature ($\\Delta T_\\text{b}$) of at least\n$\\geq 400$ K. The events show a large variety in size up to ~ $9$ arcsec,\namplitude $\\Delta T_\\text{b}$ up to ~ $1200$ K with typical values between ~\n$450$ - $750$ K and lifetime at FWHM of $\\Delta T_\\text{b}$ between ~ $43$ -\n$360$ s, with typical values between ~ $55$ - $125$ s. Furthermore, many of the\nevents show signature properties that suggest that they are likely produced by\npropagating shock waves. There are a lot of small-scale dynamic structures\ndetected in the Band 3 data, even though the spatial resolution sets\nlimitations of the size of events that can be detected. The amount of dynamic\nsignatures in the ALMA mm data is very low in areas with photospheric\nfootpoints with stronger magnetic fields, which is consistent with the\nexpectation for propagating shock waves.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 13:55:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-23"}

A survey was designed to\nanswer two research questions: To what extent is there a pre-existing sentiment\n(negative or positive) among students, engineers, and managers towards genetic\nalgorithm-based design? and What are the requirements of practitioners with\nregards to design optimisation and the design optimisation process?

This FC of the brain\nprovides insight into certain neurodegenerative diseases and psychiatric\ndisorders, and thus is of clinical importance. To help inform physicians\nregarding patient diagnoses, unsupervised clustering of subjects based on FC is\ndesired, allowing the data to inform us of groupings of patients based on\nshared features of connectivity. Since heterogeneity in FC is present even\nbetween patients within the same group, it is important to allow subject-level\ndifferences in connectivity, while still pooling information across patients\nwithin each group to describe group-level FC. To this end, we propose a random\ncovariance clustering model (RCCM) to concurrently cluster subjects based on\ntheir FC networks, estimate the unique FC networks of each subject, and to\ninfer shared network features. Although current methods exist for estimating FC\nor clustering subjects using fMRI data, our novel contribution is to cluster or\ngroup subjects based on similar FC of the brain while simultaneously providing\ngroup- and subject-level FC network estimates. The competitive performance of\nRCCM relative to other methods is demonstrated through simulations in various\nsettings, achieving both improved clustering of subjects and estimation of FC\nnetworks.

Here we establish stochastic\nP-bifurcation behavior of (i) a growth model with state-dependent birth rate\nand constant death rate, and (ii) a logistic growth model with state-dependent\ncarrying capacity, both of which are driven by multiplicative symmetric stable\nLevy noise. Transcritical bifurcation occurs in the deterministic counterpart\nof the first model, while saddle-node bifurcation takes place in the logistic\ngrowth model. We focus on the impact of the variations of the growth rate, the\nper capita daily adult mortality rate, the stability index, and the noise\nintensity on the stationary probability density functions of the associated\nnon-local Fokker-Planck equation. In the first model, the bifurcation parameter\nis the ratio of the population birth rate to the population death rate. In the\nsecond model, the bifurcation parameter corresponds to the sensitivity of\ncarrying capacity to change in the size of the population near equilibrium. In\neach case, we show that as the value of the bifurcation parameter increases,\nthe shape of the steady-state probability density function changes and that\nboth stochastic models exhibit stochastic P-bifurcation.

Those studies either treated motivation\nas an inseparable concept or focused on non-intrinsic motivation. The current\nstudy aims to cover intrinsic motivation by taking an affective-engineering\napproach. A novel motivation model is proposed, in which intrinsic motivation\nis affected by two factors that derive from user interactions with virtual\nassistants: expectation of capability and uncertainty. Experiments are\nconducted where these two factors are manipulated by making participants\nbelieve they are interacting with the smart speaker \"Amazon Echo\". Intrinsic\nmotivation is measured both by using questionnaires and by covertly monitoring\na five-minute free-choice period in the experimenter's absence, during which\nthe participants could decide for themselves whether to interact with the\nvirtual assistants. Results of the first experiment showed that high\nexpectation engenders more intrinsically motivated interaction compared with\nlow expectation.

When bound,\nmotors and polymer beads experience an equal and opposite active force,\ndirected tangential to the polymer; this leads to motion of the motors along\nthe polymer contour.

The designed RMDL\nnetwork is capable of capturing instance-wise dependencies and recalibrating\ninstance features according to the importance coefficient learned from the\nfused features. Furthermore, we build a large whole-slide gastric\nhistopathology image dataset with detailed pixel-level annotations.\nExperimental results on the constructed gastric dataset demonstrate the\nsignificant improvement on the accuracy of our proposed framework compared with\nother state-of-the-art multi-instance learning methods. Moreover, our method is\ngeneral and can be extended to other diagnosis tasks of different cancer types\nbased on WSIs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 14:55:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-14"}

Although the most common formulation of\ntext ranking is search, instances of the task can also be found in many natural\nlanguage processing applications. This survey provides an overview of text\nranking with neural network architectures known as transformers, of which BERT\nis the best-known example. The combination of transformers and self-supervised\npretraining has been responsible for a paradigm shift in natural language\nprocessing (NLP), information retrieval (IR), and beyond. In this survey, we\nprovide a synthesis of existing work as a single point of entry for\npractitioners who wish to gain a better understanding of how to apply\ntransformers to text ranking problems and researchers who wish to pursue work\nin this area. We cover a wide range of modern techniques, grouped into two\nhigh-level categories: transformer models that perform reranking in multi-stage\narchitectures and dense retrieval techniques that perform ranking directly.\nThere are two themes that pervade our survey: techniques for handling long\ndocuments, beyond typical sentence-by-sentence processing in NLP, and\ntechniques for addressing the tradeoff between effectiveness (i.e., result\nquality) and efficiency (e.g., query latency, model and index size). Although\ntransformer architectures and pretraining techniques are recent innovations,\nmany aspects of how they are applied to text ranking are relatively well\nunderstood and represent mature techniques. However, there remain many open\nresearch questions, and thus in addition to laying out the foundations of\npretrained transformers for text ranking, this survey also attempts to\nprognosticate where the field is heading.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 15:20:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Jul 2021 13:35:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 19 Aug 2021 16:37:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-20"}

We put forward a large multilingual benchmark, XL-WiC,\nfeaturing gold standards in 12 new languages from varied language families and\nwith different degrees of resource availability, opening room for evaluation\nscenarios such as zero-shot cross-lingual transfer. We perform a series of\nexperiments to determine the reliability of the datasets and to set performance\nbaselines for several recent contextualized multilingual models. Experimental\nresults show that even when no tagged instances are available for a target\nlanguage, models trained solely on the English data can attain competitive\nperformance in the task of distinguishing different meanings of a word, even\nfor distant languages.

The benefit is\nmeasured in terms of increasing the epidemic threshold which is a measure of\nhow difficult it is for an infection to spread in a network. The cost is\nmeasured in terms of the number and size of nodes to be removed or controlled.\nAlready in its single-objective instance with a fixed number of $k$ nodes to be\nremoved, the multiple vertex immunisation problems have been proven to be\nNP-hard.

Aims: This paper is the first of a series aiming\nto extensively characterise the system.

While several methods perform well on\nsmall domain shifts like new target classes with similar inputs, larger domain\nshifts are still challenging. Large domain shifts may result in high-level\nconcepts that are not shared between the original and the new domain, whereas\nlow-level concepts like edges in images might still be shared and useful.

Limiting the number of Sybil (bad) IDs to a minority is critical\nto the use of well-established tools for tolerating malicious behavior, such as\nByzantine agreement and secure multiparty computation.\n  A popular technique for enforcing a Sybil minority is resource burning: the\nverifiable consumption of a network resource, such as computational power,\nbandwidth, or memory. Unfortunately, typical defenses based on resource burning\nrequire non-Sybil (good) IDs to consume at least as many resources as the\nadversary. Additionally, they have a high resource burning cost, even when the\nsystem membership is relatively stable.\n  Here, we present a new Sybil defense, ERGO, that guarantees (1) there is\nalways a minority of bad IDs; and (2) when the system is under significant\nattack, the good IDs consume asymptotically less resources than the bad. In\nparticular, for churn rate that can vary exponentially, the resource burning\nrate for good IDs under ERGO is O(\\sqrt{TJ} + J), where T is the resource\nburning rate of the adversary, and J is the join rate of good IDs.

The definition of these operators\nis achieved by establishing a second quantum field in the momentum space of the\nstandard field we want to localize (here Klein-Gordon field). The motivation\nfor defining a new field in momentum space is as follows. In standard field\ntheories one can define a momentum (and energy) operator for a field excitation\nbut not a general position (and time) operator because the field satisfies a\ndifferential equation in position space and, through its Fourier transform, an\nalgebraic equation in momentum space. Thus, in a field theory which does the\nopposite, namely it satisfies a differential equation in momentum space and an\nalgebraic equation in position space, we will be able to define a position and\ntime operator. Since the new field lives in the momentum space of the\nKlein-Gordon field, the creation/annihilation operators of the former, which\nbuild the new space and time operators, reduce to the field operators of the\nlatter. As a result, particle states of Klein-Gordon field are eigenstates of\nthe new space and time operators and therefore localized on a space-time\ndescribed by their spectrum. Finally, we show that this space-time is flat\nbecause it accommodates the two postulates of special relativity.\nInterpretation of special relativistic notions as inertial observers and proper\nacceleration in terms of the new field is also provided.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Oct 2020 18:10:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2020 18:18:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-01"}

More specifically, multiple\narms are grouped together to form a cluster, and the reward distributions of\narms belonging to the same cluster are known functions of an unknown parameter\nthat is a characteristic of the cluster. Thus, pulling an arm $i$ not only\nreveals information about its own reward distribution, but also about all those\narms that share the same cluster with arm $i$. This \"correlation\" amongst the\narms complicates the exploration-exploitation trade-off that is encountered in\nthe MABP because the observation dependencies allow us to test simultaneously\nmultiple hypotheses regarding the optimality of an arm. We develop learning\nalgorithms based on the UCB principle which utilize these additional side\nobservations appropriately while performing exploration-exploitation trade-off.\nWe show that the regret of our algorithms grows as $O(K\\log T)$, where $K$ is\nthe number of clusters. In contrast, for an algorithm such as the vanilla UCB\nthat is optimal for the classical MABP and does not utilize these dependencies,\nthe regret scales as $O(M\\log T)$ where $M$ is the number of arms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 14:00:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Oct 2020 21:06:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-27"}

The transfer generalization gap is the difference between\nthe population loss on the target data distribution and the training loss. The\ntraining data set generally includes data drawn from both source and target\ndistributions. This work presents novel information-theoretic upper bounds on\nthe average transfer generalization gap that capture $(i)$ the domain shift\nbetween the target data distribution $P'_Z$ and the source distribution $P_Z$\nthrough a two-parameter family of generalized\n$(\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2)$-Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergences; and $(ii)$ the\nsensitivity of the transfer learner output $W$ to each individual sample of the\ndata set $Z_i$ via the mutual information $I(W;Z_i)$. For $\\alpha_1 \\in (0,1)$,\nthe $(\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2)$-JS divergence can be bounded even when the support of\n$P_Z$ is not included in that of $P'_Z$. This contrasts the Kullback-Leibler\n(KL) divergence $D_{KL}(P_Z||P'_Z)$-based bounds of Wu et al. [1], which are\nvacuous under this assumption. Moreover, the obtained bounds hold for unbounded\nloss functions with bounded cumulant generating functions, unlike the\n$\\phi$-divergence based bound of Wu et al. [1].

The properties of\nchaotic neurons inspires us to employ them in artificial learning systems.\nHere, we propose a Neurochaos Learning (NL) architecture, where the neurons\nused to extract features from data are 1D chaotic maps. ChaosFEX+SVM, an\ninstance of this NL architecture, is proposed as a hybrid combination of chaos\nand classical machine learning algorithm. We formally prove that a single layer\nof NL with a finite number of 1D chaotic neurons satisfies the Universal\nApproximation Theorem with an exact value for the number of chaotic neurons\nneeded to approximate a discrete real valued function with finite support. This\nis made possible due to the topological transitivity property of chaos and the\nexistence of uncountably infinite number of dense orbits for the chosen 1D\nchaotic map. The chaotic neurons in NL get activated under the presence of an\ninput stimulus (data) and output a chaotic firing trajectory. From such chaotic\nfiring trajectories of individual neurons of NL, we extract Firing Time, Firing\nRate, Energy and Entropy that constitute ChaosFEX features. These ChaosFEX\nfeatures are then fed to a Support Vector Machine with linear kernel for\nclassification. The effectiveness of chaotic feature engineering performed by\nNL (ChaosFEX+SVM) is demonstrated for synthetic and real world datasets in the\nlow and high training sample regimes.

Such loads appear frequently in a wide\nrange of applications in ocean and mechanical engineering, such as wind\nturbines and offshore structures. In this work we employ the Serebrinsky-Ortiz\ncohesive envelope model for material fatigue to characterize the effects of\nload intermittency on the fatigue-crack nucleation time. We first formulate\nefficient numerical integration schemes, which allow for the direct\ncharacterization of the fatigue life in terms of any given load time-series.\nSubsequently, we consider the case of stochastic intermittent loads with given\nstatistical characteristics. To overcome the need for expensive Monte-Carlo\nsimulations, we formulate the fatigue life as an up-crossing problem of the\ncoherent envelope. Assuming statistical independence for the large intermittent\nspikes and using probabilistic arguments we derive closed expressions for the\nup-crossing properties of the coherent envelope and obtain analytical\napproximations for the probability mass function of the failure time. The\nanalytical expressions are derived directly in terms of the probability density\nfunction of the load, as well as the coherent envelope. We examine the accuracy\nof the analytical approximations and compare the predicted failure time with\nthe standard rainflow algorithm for various loads.
