Moreover, the quality of the solutions our approach produces\nmatches well with those generated by GA.

Moreover, the Bayesian approach was able to characterize subgroups of\npatients associated with different responses to treatment in the PRIME study.\nOur study suggests that the Bayesian approach using INLA algorithm enables to\nfit complex joint models that might be of interest in a wide range of clinical\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Oct 2020 16:41:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Apr 2021 08:56:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 27 Jan 2023 08:47:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-30"}

Indeed, the CAP theorem in the\ncontext of blockchains asserts that no protocol can simultaneously offer both\nadaptivity and finality.\n  We propose a new blockchain protocol, called the checkpointed longest chain,\nthat offers individual users the choice between finality and adaptivity instead\nof imposing it at a system-wide level. This protocol's salient feature is that\nit supports two distinct confirmation rules: one that guarantees adaptivity and\nthe other finality.

Clients (users) make\na local choice between the confirmation rules as per their personal preference,\nwhile miners follow a fixed block proposal rule that is consistent with both\nconfirmation rules. The proposed protocol has the additional benefit of\nintrinsic validity: the finalized blocks always lie on a single blockchain, and\ntherefore miners can attest to the validity of transactions while proposing\nblocks. Our protocol builds on the notion of a finality gadget, a popular\ntechnique for adding finality to longest-chain protocols.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Oct 2020 16:53:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 2 Apr 2021 06:22:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-05"}

A\nbalanced-force implementation of the continuum surface force model is used to\ntake into account the surface tension and to solve static problems as\naccurately as possible.

Using a single element through the thickness in combination with a\ncalibrated layerwise integration rule or a homogenized approach, the 3D solid\nisogeometric modeling grants an inexpensive and accurate approximation in terms\nof displacements (and their derivatives) and in-plane stresses, while\nthrough-the-thickness stress components are poorly approximated. Applying a\nfurther post-processing step, an accurate out-of-plane stress state is also\nrecovered, even from a coarse displacement solution. This is based on a direct\nintegration of the equilibrium equations in strong form, involving high order\nderivatives of the displacement field. Such a continuity requirement is fully\ngranted by IGA shape function properties.

To date, most HGRL models rely on\nhand-crafted meta-paths. However, the dependency on manually-defined meta-paths\nrequires domain knowledge, which is difficult to obtain for complex HINs. More\nimportantly, the pre-defined or generated meta-paths of all existing HGRL\nmethods attached to each node type or node pair cannot be personalised to each\nindividual node. To fully unleash the power of HGRL, we present a novel\nframework, Personalised Meta-path based Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks\n(PM-HGNN), to jointly generate meta-paths that are personalised for each\nindividual node in a HIN and learn node representations for the target\ndownstream task like node classification. Precisely, PM-HGNN treats the\nmeta-path generation as a Markov Decision Process and utilises a policy network\nto adaptively generate a meta-path for each individual node and simultaneously\nlearn effective node representations. The policy network is trained with deep\nreinforcement learning by exploiting the performance improvement on a\ndownstream task. We further propose an extension, PM-HGNN++, to better encode\nrelational structure and accelerate the training during the meta-path\ngeneration. Experimental results reveal that both PM-HGNN and PM-HGNN++ can\nsignificantly and consistently outperform 16 competing baselines and\nstate-of-the-art methods in various settings of node classification.\nQualitative analysis also shows that PM-HGNN++ can identify meaningful\nmeta-paths overlooked by human knowledge.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Oct 2020 17:22:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2022 12:06:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-12"}

In an\ninformation embedding attack, an attacker is the provider of a malicious\nthird-party machine learning tool. The attacker embeds a message into the DNN\nclassifier during training and recovers the message via querying the API of the\nblack-box classifier after the user deploys it. Information embedding attacks\nhave attracted growing attention because of various applications such as\nwatermarking DNN classifiers and compromising user privacy. State-of-the-art\ninformation embedding attacks have two key limitations: 1) they cannot verify\nthe correctness of the recovered message, and 2) they are not robust against\npost-processing of the classifier.\n  In this work, we aim to design information embedding attacks that are\nverifiable and robust against popular post-processing methods. Specifically, we\nleverage Cyclic Redundancy Check to verify the correctness of the recovered\nmessage. Moreover, to be robust against post-processing, we leverage Turbo\ncodes, a type of error-correcting codes, to encode the message before embedding\nit to the DNN classifier. We propose to recover the message via adaptively\nquerying the classifier to save queries. Our adaptive recovery strategy\nleverages the property of Turbo codes that supports error correcting with a\npartial code. We evaluate our information embedding attacks using simulated\nmessages and apply them to three applications, where messages have semantic\ninterpretations. We consider 8 popular methods to post-process the classifier.\nOur results show that our attacks can accurately and verifiably recover the\nmessages in all considered scenarios, while state-of-the-art attacks cannot\naccurately recover the messages in many scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Oct 2020 17:42:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-27"}

Rethinking reconstruction networks as a generator, we define the\nproblem of predicting masks as a GANs game framework: A segmentation network\ngenerates the masks, and a discriminator network decides on the quality of the\nmasks. To demonstrate this game, we show effective modifications on the general\nsegmentation framework in Mask R-CNN.

Unbroken flavor symmetries are subgroups of this eclectic\ngroup and their size depends on the location in moduli space. This mechanism of\nlocal flavor unification allows a different flavor structure for different\nsectors of the theory (such as quarks and leptons) and also explains the\nspontaneous breakdown of flavor- and CP-symmetries (via a motion in moduli\nspace). We derive the modular groups, including CP and R-symmetries, for\ndifferent sub-sectors of six-dimensional string compactifications and determine\nthe general properties of the allowed flavor groups from this top-down\nperspective. It leads to a very predictive flavor scheme that should be\nconfronted with the variety of existing bottom-up constructions of flavor\nsymmetry in order to clarify which of them could have a consistent top-down\ncompletion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Oct 2020 18:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 21 Apr 2021 14:38:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-22"}

To properly study and\ncharacterize the origin of quantum \"complexity\" in computation as well as\nphysics, it is crucial to develop a rigorous understanding of the\nquantification of magic. Previous studies of magic mostly focused on small\nsystems and largely relied on the discrete Wigner formalism (which is only well\nbehaved in odd prime power dimensions). Here we present an initiatory study of\nthe magic of genuinely many-body quantum states that may be strongly entangled,\nwith focus on the important case of many qubits, at a quantitative level. We\nfirst address the basic question of how \"magical\" a many-body state can be, and\nshow that the maximum magic of an $n$-qubit state is essentially $n$,\nsimultaneously for a range of \"good\" magic measures. We then show that, in\nfact, almost all $n$-qubit pure states have magic of nearly $n$. In the quest\nfor explicit, scalable cases of highly entangled states whose magic can be\nunderstood, we connect the magic of hypergraph states with the second-order\nnonlinearity of their underlying Boolean functions. Next, we go on and\ninvestigate many-body magic in practical and physical contexts. We first\nconsider a variant of MBQC where the client is restricted to Pauli\nmeasurements, in which magic is a necessary feature of the initial \"resource\"\nstate. We show that $n$-qubit states with nearly $n$ magic, or indeed almost\nall states, cannot supply nontrivial speedups over classical computers. We then\npresent an example of analyzing the magic of \"natural\" condensed matter systems\nof physical interest.

Here we propose a\nstrategy of using a 1L-WS$_2$ as an optimum tunnel barrier sandwiched in a\nbroken gap tunnel junction of highly doped black phosphorus (BP) and SnSe$_2$.\nWe achieve high yield tunnel diodes exhibiting highly repeatable, ultra-clean,\nand gate tunable NDR characteristics with a signature of intrinsic oscillation,\nand a large peak-to-valley current ratio (PVCR) of 3.6 at 300 K (4.6 at 7 K),\nmaking them suitable for practical applications. We show that the thermodynamic\nstability of the vdW tunnel diode circuit can be tuned from astability to\nbistability by altering the constraint through choosing a voltage or a current\nbias, respectively. In the astable mode under voltage bias, we demonstrate a\ncompact, voltage controlled oscillator without the need for an external tank\ncircuit. In the bistable mode under current bias, we demonstrate a highly\nscalable, single element one-bit memory cell that is promising for dense random\naccess memory applications in memory intensive computation architectures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Oct 2020 18:30:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-28"}

To resolve such a\nconflict, a central designer may intervene by either redesigning the system or\nincentivizing the agents to change their behaviors. To be effective, the\ndesigner must anticipate how the agents react to the intervention, which is\ndictated by their often unknown payoff functions. Therefore, learning about the\nagents is a prerequisite for intervention. In this paper, we provide a unified\nframework for learning and intervention in games. We cast the equilibria of\ngames as individual layers and integrate them into an end-to-end optimization\nframework. To enable the backward propagation through the equilibria of games,\nwe propose two approaches, respectively based on explicit and implicit\ndifferentiation. Specifically, we cast the equilibria as the solutions to\nvariational inequalities (VIs). The explicit approach unrolls the projection\nmethod for solving VIs, while the implicit approach exploits the sensitivity of\nthe solutions to VIs. At the core of both approaches is the differentiation\nthrough a projection operator. Moreover, we establish the correctness of both\napproaches and identify the conditions under which one approach is more\ndesirable than the other. The analytical results are validated using several\nreal-world problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Oct 2020 18:39:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-28"}

We aim to\nshed light on the formation of these objects by studying the redshift and mass\ndependence of their intrinsic 3D shape distributions in the COSMOS galaxy\nsurvey below redshift $z=1.0$. This distribution is inferred from the observed\ndistribution of 2D shapes, using a reconstruction method which we test using\nhydrodynamic simulations. Our tests reveal a moderate bias for the inferred\naverage disc circularity and relative thickness, but a large bias on the\ndispersion of these quantities. Applying the reconstruction method on COSMOS\ndata, we find variations of the average disc circularity and relative thickness\nwith redshift of around $\\sim1\\%$ and $\\sim10\\%$ respectively, which is\ncomparable to the error estimates on these quantities. The average relative\ndisc thickness shows a significant mass dependence which can be accounted for\nby the scaling of disc radius with galaxy mass. We conclude that our data\nprovides no evidence for a strong dependence of the average circularity and\nabsolute thickness of disc-dominated galaxies on redshift and mass that is\nsignificant with respect to the statistical uncertainties in our analysis.\nThese findings are expected in the absence of disruptive merging or feedback\nevents that would affect galaxy shapes.

The aims\nof this work are to assess the capability of linear elasticity (Young's\nmodulus) or hyperelasticity in predicting hypobaric pressure induced 3D\nstretching of the skin. Using experiments and computational Finite Element\nMethod modelling, this work demonstrated that although it was possible to\npredict the suction dome apex height using both linear elasticity and\nhyperelasticity for the typical range of hypobaric pressure in medical\napplications (up to -10 psi), linear elasticity theory showed limitations when\npredicting the strain distribution across the suction dome. The reason is that\nthe stretch ratio reaches values exceeding the initial linear elastic stage of\nthe stress-strain characteristic curve for skin. As a result, the linear\nelasticity theory overpredicts the stretch along the rim of domes where there\nis stress concentration. In addition, the modelling showed that the skin was\ncompressed consistently along the thickness direction, leading to reduced\nthickness. Using hyperelasticity modelling to predict the 3D strain\ndistribution paves the way to accurately design safe commercial products that\ninterface with skin.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Oct 2020 19:03:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-28"}

A more subtle\nproblem is the determination of the corner charge of a two-dimensional\ninsulator, modulo $e$, from a knowledge of bulk and edge properties alone.\nWhile previous works have tended to focus on the quantization of corner charge\nin the presence of symmetries, here we focus on the case that the only bulk\nsymmetry is inversion, so that the corner charge can take arbitrary values. We\ndevelop a Wannier-based formalism that allows the corner charge to be\npredicted, modulo $e$, only from calculations on ribbon geometries of two\ndifferent orientations. We elucidate the dependence of the interior quadrupole\nand edge dipole contributions upon the gauge used to construct the Wannier\nfunctions, finding that while these are individually gauge-dependent, their sum\nis gauge-independent. From this we conclude that the edge polarization is not\nby itself a physical observable, and that any Wannier-based method for\ncomputing the corner charge requires the use of a common gauge throughout the\ncalculation. We satisfy this constraint using two Wannier construction\nprocedures, one based on projection and another based on a gauge-consistent\nnested Wannier construction. We validate our theory by demonstrating the\ncorrect prediction of corner charge for several tight-binding models. We\ncomment on the relations between our approach and previous ones that have\nappeared in the literature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Oct 2020 19:30:54 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 31 Dec 2020 21:32:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 28 Jan 2021 23:54:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}

Historically, analyzing the\ncausal structure of DNNs has received less attention than understanding their\nresponses to input. Yet definitionally, generalizability must be a function of\na DNN's causal structure since it reflects how the DNN responds to unseen or\neven not-yet-defined future inputs. Here, we introduce a suite of metrics based\non information theory to quantify and track changes in the causal structure of\nDNNs during training. Specifically, we introduce the effective information (EI)\nof a feedforward DNN, which is the mutual information between layer input and\noutput following a maximum-entropy perturbation. The EI can be used to assess\nthe degree of causal influence nodes and edges have over their downstream\ntargets in each layer. We show that the EI can be further decomposed in order\nto examine the sensitivity of a layer (measured by how well edges transmit\nperturbations) and the degeneracy of a layer (measured by how edge overlap\ninterferes with transmission), along with estimates of the amount of integrated\ninformation of a layer. Together, these properties define where each layer lies\nin the \"causal plane\" which can be used to visualize how layer connectivity\nbecomes more sensitive or degenerate over time, and how integration changes\nduring training, revealing how the layer-by-layer causal structure\ndifferentiates. These results may help in understanding the generalization\ncapabilities of DNNs and provide foundational tools for making DNNs both more\ngeneralizable and more explainable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Oct 2020 19:53:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-28"}

Magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) memory elements can be used for\ncomputation by manipulating a domain wall (DW), a transition region between\nmagnetic domains. But, these devices have suffered from challenges: spin\ntransfer torque (STT) switching of a DW requires high current, and the multiple\netch steps needed to create an MTJ pillar on top of a DW track has led to\nreduced tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR). These issues have limited experimental\nstudy of devices and circuits.

This has spurred interested in developing approaches that\ncan provably verify whether a model satisfies certain properties. This paper\nintroduces a generic algorithm called Veritas that enables tackling multiple\ndifferent verification tasks for tree ensemble models like random forests (RFs)\nand gradient boosting decision trees (GBDTs). This generality contrasts with\nprevious work, which has focused exclusively on either adversarial example\ngeneration or robustness checking. Veritas formulates the verification task as\na generic optimization problem and introduces a novel search space\nrepresentation. Veritas offers two key advantages. First, it provides anytime\nlower and upper bounds when the optimization problem cannot be solved exactly.\nIn contrast, many existing methods have focused on exact solutions and are thus\nlimited by the verification problem being NP-complete.

We produced Titan analog haze\nmaterials, so-called \"tholin\", with different energy sources and measured their\nsurface energies through contact angle and direct force measurements. From the\ncontact angle measurement, we found that the tholins produced by cold plasma\nand UV irradiation have total surface energy around 60-70 mJ/m2.

The applications are wide-ranging and include for\nexample matchings, shortest paths, linear programming, semi-definite\nprogramming, convex hull and volume computation. Given the wide range of\napplications, the exact property these data structures must maintain varies\nfrom one application to another, forcing algorithm designers to invent them\nfrom scratch or modify existing ones. Thus it is not surprising that these data\nstructures and their proofs are usually tailor-made for their specific\napplication and that maintaining more complicated properties results in more\ncomplicated proofs.\n  In this paper we present a unifying framework that captures a wide range of\nthese data structures. The simplicity of this framework allows us to give short\nproofs for many existing data structures regardless of how complicated the to\nbe maintained property is.

Challenges remain to discover\nadditional variants contributing to complex diseases. Expectile regression is a\ngeneralization of linear regression and provides completed information on the\nconditional distribution of a phenotype of interest. While expectile regression\nhas many nice properties and holds great promise for genetic data analyses\n(e.g., investigating genetic variants predisposing to a high-risk population),\nit has been rarely used in genetic research.

Most existing literature on\nindividualized treatment rules targets absolute conditional treatment effect\ndifferences as the metric for benefits. However, there can be settings where\nrelative differences may better represent such benefits. In this paper, we\nconsider modeling such relative differences that form scale-invariant contrasts\nbetween conditional treatment effects. We show that all scale-invariant\ncontrasts are monotonic transformations of each other. Therefore we posit a\nsingle index model for a particular relative contrast. Identifiability of the\nmodel is enforced via an intuitive $l_2$ norm constraint on index parameters.\nWe then derive estimating equations and efficient scores via semiparametric\nefficiency theory. Based on the efficient score and its variant, we propose a\ntwo-step approach that consists of minimizing a doubly robust loss function and\na subsequent one-step efficiency augmentation procedure to achieve efficiency\nbound. Careful theoretical and numerical studies are provided to show the\nsuperiority of the proposed approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Oct 2020 21:14:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 31 Oct 2020 09:05:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 3 May 2021 21:24:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-05"}

As in the Maxwell theory, there is a choice of boundary conditions with\nan infinite-dimensional asymptotic symmetry group. For higher $p$-form theories\non $(2p+2)$-dimensional flat spacetime, the surface charges are classified by\nthe Hodge decomposition of gauge parameters on $2p$-sphere into exact and\nco-exact charges. For the exact parameters which are special features of\nhigher-form theories, the surface charges are non-commuting. In presence of\n$p$-branes, there are non-trivial zero-mode charges analogous to the electric\ncharge for point particles. Although our $p$-form discussion is restricted to\n$2p+2$ dimensions, we generalize the study of Maxwell theory not only to\ngeneral dimensions but also to the anti-de Sitter background. Finally,\nmotivated by the IR triangle of gauge theories that relate asymptotic\nsymmetries, memory effects, and soft theorems, we introduce a new kind of\nmemory effect exerted on the internal modes of closed and open strings. On\nclosed string probes, soft 2-form radiation rotates left- and right-moving\nmodes oppositely, which amounts to a unit shift in the spin of probe particles.\nThis provides the first instance of an `internal memory effect' on a non-local\nobject. We conclude by general remarks on the physical significance of soft\nmodes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Oct 2020 22:02:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-28"}

To achieve our results, we develop a\nnovel session decomposition technique, from full session types (including\ninternal/external choices) into single input/output session trees (without\nchoices). Previous work studies precise subtyping for binary sessions (with\njust two participants), or multiparty sessions (with any number of\nparticipants) and synchronous interaction. Here, we cover multiparty sessions\nwith asynchronous interaction, where messages are transmitted via FIFO queues\n(as in the TCP/IP protocol), and prove that our subtyping is both operationally\nand denotationally precise. In the asynchronous multiparty setting, finding the\nprecise subtyping relation is a highly complex task: this is because, under\nsome conditions, participants can permute the order of their inputs and\noutputs, by sending some messages earlier or receiving some later, without\ncausing errors; the precise subtyping relation must capture all such valid\npermutations -- and consequently, its formalisation, reasoning and proofs\nbecome challenging.

However, due\nto the nonconvexity of the Schatten-$p$ quasi-norm, minimization suffers from\ntwo major drawbacks: 1) the lack of theoretical guarantees and 2) the high\ncomputational cost which is demanded for the minimization task even for trivial\ntasks such as finding stationary points. In an attempt to reduce the high\ncomputational cost induced by Schatten-$p$ quasi-norm minimization, variational\nforms, which are defined over smaller-size matrix factors whose product equals\nthe original matrix, have been proposed. Here, we propose and analyze a novel\nvariational form of Schatten-$p$ quasi-norm which, for the first time in the\nliterature, is defined for any continuous value of $p\\in(0,1]$ and decouples\nalong the columns of the factorized matrices. The proposed form can be\nconsidered as the natural generalization of the well-known variational form of\nthe nuclear norm to the nonconvex case i.e., for $p\\in(0,1)$. The resulting\nformulation gives way to SVD-free algorithms thus offering lower computational\ncomplexity than the one that is induced by the original definition of the\nSchatten-$p$ quasi-norm. A local optimality analysis is provided which\nshows~that we can arrive at a local minimum of the original Schatten-$p$\nquasi-norm problem by reaching a local minimum of the matrix factorization\nbased surrogate problem. In addition, for the case of the squared Frobenius\nloss with linear operators obeying the restricted isometry property (RIP), a\nrank-one update scheme is proposed, which offers a way to escape poor local\nminima.

In\nclassical statistics, increasing the complexity of a model (e.g., number of\nparameters) reduces bias but also increases variance. Until recently, it was\ncommonly believed that optimal performance is achieved at intermediate model\ncomplexities which strike a balance between bias and variance. Modern Deep\nLearning methods flout this dogma, achieving state-of-the-art performance using\n\"over-parameterized models\" where the number of fit parameters is large enough\nto perfectly fit the training data. As a result, understanding bias and\nvariance in over-parameterized models has emerged as a fundamental problem in\nmachine learning. Here, we use methods from statistical physics to derive\nanalytic expressions for bias and variance in two minimal models of\nover-parameterization (linear regression and two-layer neural networks with\nnonlinear data distributions), allowing us to disentangle properties stemming\nfrom the model architecture and random sampling of data. In both models,\nincreasing the number of fit parameters leads to a phase transition where the\ntraining error goes to zero and the test error diverges as a result of the\nvariance (while the bias remains finite). Beyond this threshold, the test error\nof the two-layer neural network decreases due to a monotonic decrease in\n\\emph{both} the bias and variance in contrast with the classical bias-variance\ntrade-off. We also show that in contrast with classical intuition,\nover-parameterized models can overfit even in the absence of noise and exhibit\nbias even if the student and teacher models match.

TMP's nonlinear stiffness allows it to store more\nenergy than a linear spring and offers improved jumping height and airtime.\nMoreover, the nonlinearity can be tailored by directly changing the underlying\nTMP crease geometry.

So far most of the pulsar timing\ndata analysis has focused on the monopole of the GWB, assuming it is perfectly\nisotropic. The natural next step is to search for anisotropies in the GWB. In\nthis paper, we use the recently developed PTA Fisher matrix to gain insights\ninto optimal search strategies for GWB anisotropies. For concreteness, we apply\nour results to EPTA data, using realistic noise characteristics of its pulsars.\nWe project the detectability of a GWB whose angular dependence is assumed to be\na linear combination of predetermined maps, such as spherical harmonics or\ncoarse pixels. We find that the GWB monopole is always statistically correlated\nwith these maps, implying a loss of sensitivity to the monopole when searching\nsimultaneously for anisotropies. We then derive the angular distributions of\nthe GWB intensity to which a PTA is most sensitive, and illustrate how one may\nuse these \"principal maps\" to approximately reconstruct the angular dependence\nof the GWB. Since the principal maps are neither perfectly anisotropic nor\nuncorrelated with the monopole, we also develop a frequentist criterion to\nspecifically search for anisotropies in the GWB without any prior knowledge\nabout their angular distribution. Lastly, we show how to recover existing EPTA\nresults with our Fisher formalism, and clarify their meaning.

These are a special case of area measures of hypersurfaces which\nwere introduced early on in the field of convex geometry. The length measure of\na curve is a measure on the circle $\\mathbb{S}^1$ that intuitively represents\nthe length of the portion of curve which tangent vector points in a certain\ndirection. While a planar closed curve is not characterized by its length\nmeasure, the fundamental Minkowski-Fenchel-Jessen theorem states that length\nmeasures fully characterize convex curves modulo translations, making it a\nparticularly useful tool in the study of geometric properties of convex\nobjects. The present work, that was initially motivated by problems in shape\nanalysis, introduces length measures for the general class of Lipschitz\nimmersed and oriented planar closed curves, and derives some of the basic\nproperties of the length measure map on this class of curves. We then focus\nspecifically on the case of convex shapes and present several new results.\nFirst, we prove an isoperimetric characterization of the unique convex curve\nassociated to some length measure given by the Minkowski-Fenchel-Jessen\ntheorem, namely that it maximizes the signed area among all the curves sharing\nthe same length measure. Second, we address the problem of constructing a\ndistance with associated geodesic paths between convex planar curves. For that\npurpose, we introduce and study a new distance on the space of length measures\nthat corresponds to a constrained variant of the Wasserstein metric of optimal\ntransport, from which we can induce a distance between convex curves. We also\npropose a primal-dual algorithm to numerically compute those distances and\ngeodesics, and show a few simple simulations to illustrate the approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 00:29:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-28"}

With a single NVIDIA Tesla V100-32 GPU, we achieve speedups of up\nto 19x for SHAP values, and speedups of up to 340x for SHAP interaction values,\nover a state-of-the-art multi-core CPU implementation executed on two 20-core\nXeon E5-2698 v4 2.2 GHz CPUs. We also experiment with multi-GPU computing using\neight V100 GPUs, demonstrating throughput of 1.2M rows per second -- equivalent\nCPU-based performance is estimated to require 6850 CPU cores.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 00:55:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Jul 2021 22:54:35 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 3 Feb 2022 11:53:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-04"}

In\nthis letter we calculate exactly the single-interval and double-interval\nR\\'enyi entropies of quasiparticle excitations in the many-body gapped\nfermions, bosons, and XY chains. We find additional contributions to the\nuniversal R\\'enyi entropy in the excited states with quasiparticles of\ndifferent momenta. The additional terms are different in the fermionic and\nbosonic chains, depend on the momentum differences of the quasiparticles, and\nare different for the single interval and the double interval. We derive the\nanalytical R\\'enyi entropy in the extremely gapped limit, matching perfectly\nthe numerical results as long as either the intrinsic correlation length of the\nmodel or all the de Broglie wavelengths of the quasiparticles are small. When\nthe momentum difference of any pair of distinct quasiparticles is small, the\nadditional terms are non-negligible. On the contrary, when the difference of\nthe momenta of each pair of distinct quasiparticles is large, the additional\nterms could be neglected. The universal single-interval R\\'enyi entropy and its\nadditional terms in the XY chain are the same as those in the fermionic chain,\nwhile the universal R\\'enyi entropy of the double intervals and its additional\nterms are different, due to the fact that the local degrees of freedom of the\nXY chain are the Pauli matrices not the spinless fermions.

In DWS, dynamic samples scatter the\nincident coherent light, and the information of the temporal dynamics is\nencoded in the scattered light. To record and analyze the light signal, there\nexist two types of methods - temporal sampling methods and speckle ensemble\nmethods. Temporal sampling methods, including diffuse correlation spectroscopy\n(DCS), use one or multiple large bandwidth detectors to well sample and analyze\nthe temporal light signal to infer the sample temporal dynamics. Speckle\nensemble methods, including speckle visibility spectroscopy (SVS), use a\nhigh-pixel-count camera sensor to capture a speckle pattern and use the speckle\ncontrast to infer sample temporal dynamics. In this paper, we theoretically and\nexperimentally demonstrate that the decorrelation time ({\\tau}) measurement\naccuracy or SNR of the two types of methods has a unified and similar\nfundamental expression based on the number of independent observables (NIO) and\nthe photon flux. Given a time measurement duration, NIO in temporal sampling\nmethods is constrained by the measurement duration, while speckle ensemble\nmethods can outperform by using simultaneous sampling channels to scale up NIO\nsignificantly. In the case of optical brain monitoring, the interplay of these\nfactors favors speckle ensemble methods. We illustrate that this important\nengineering consideration is consistent with the previous research on blood\npulsatile flow measurements, where a speckle ensemble method operating at\n100-fold lower photon flux than a conventional temporal sampling system can\nachieve a comparable SNR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 01:19:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-28"}

We built a virtual\nreality (VR) experimental environment using a commodity VR headset (HTC Vive)\nand haptic feedback enabled controller (Sensable PHANToM Omni) to simulate a\nreal teleoperated task. An experimental study with 10 subjects was then\nconducted. We also performed simulated continuous operator authentication by\nusing the JHU-ISI Gesture and Skill Assessment Working Set (JIGSAWS). The\nperformance of the model was evaluated based on the continuous (real-time)\noperator authentication accuracy as well as resistance to a simulated\nimpersonation attack. The results suggest that the proposed method is able to\nachieve 70% (VR experiment) and 81% (JIGSAW dataset) continuous classification\naccuracy with as short as a 1-second sample window. It is also capable of\ndetecting the impersonation attack in real-time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 02:33:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Apr 2021 04:49:46 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 24 Feb 2022 06:05:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-25"}

This paper aims to estimate 3D\nmesh of multiple body parts (e.g., body, hands) with large-scale differences\nfrom a single RGB image. Existing methods are mostly based on iterative\noptimization, which is very time-consuming. We propose to train a single-shot\nmodel to achieve this goal. The main challenge is lacking training data that\nhave complete 3D annotations of all body parts in 2D images. To solve this\nproblem, we design a multi-branch framework to disentangle the regression of\ndifferent body properties, enabling us to separate each component's training in\na synthetic training manner using unpaired data available. Besides, to\nstrengthen the generalization ability, most existing methods have used\nin-the-wild 2D pose datasets to supervise the estimated 3D pose via 3D-to-2D\nprojection. However, we observe that the commonly used weak-perspective model\nperforms poorly in dealing with the external foreshortening effect of camera\nprojection. Therefore, we propose a depth-to-scale (D2S) projection to\nincorporate the depth difference into the projection function to derive\nper-joint scale variants for more proper supervision. The proposed method\noutperforms previous methods on the CMU Panoptic Studio dataset according to\nthe evaluation results and achieves comparable results on the Human3.6M body\nand STB hand benchmarks. More impressively, the performance in close shot\nimages gets significantly improved using the proposed D2S projection for weak\nsupervision, while maintains obvious superiority in computational efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 03:31:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-28"}

At half\nband filling, we find that the effective interaction increases as the charge\ntransfer energy ($\\Delta_{dp}$) increases and similar behavior is obtained as a\nfunction of the interatomic 2$p$-3$d$ interaction ($U_{dp}$). However, the\neffective interaction is more sensitive to $\\Delta_{dp}$ than $ U_{dp}$. For\nmost of the parameter sets, the effective static interaction is overscreened in\ncRPA compared to cfRG. The low-energy models at half-filling are solved within\ndynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). The results show that despite the different\nstatic interactions, the systems with cRPA and cfRG interaction exhibit a Mott\ntransition at similar values of $\\Delta_{dp}$.

The LB results from the emergence of magnetic flux with one\nfootpoint rooted in a pore outside the parent sunspot that appears about 17 hrs\nbefore the LB. The pore has a polarity opposite to that of the sunspot and\nrecedes away from it at a speed of about 0.4 km/s. This is accompanied by the\ndevelopment of an elongated magnetic channel in the outer penumbra which\ntriggers the formation of the LB when it reaches the inner penumbral boundary.\nThe LB is a nearly horizontal structure with a field strength of about 1.2 kG\nthat exhibits long-lived photospheric blue-shifts of about 0.85 km/s along its\nentire length.The emergence of the LB leads to dynamic surges in the\nchromosphere and transition region about 13 min later.

P-PDEs arise in many important\napplication areas and the computational cost using traditional numerical\nschemes can be exorbitant, especially when the parameters fall into a\nparticular range and the underlying PDE is required to be solved with high\naccuracy. Recently, solving PDEs with DL has become an emerging field. Existing\nworks demonstrate great potentials of the DL based approach in speeding up\nnumerical solutions of PDEs. However, there is still limited research on the DL\napproach for P-PDEs. If we directly apply existing supervised learning models\nto P-PDEs, the models need to be constantly fine-tuned or retrained when the\nparameters change. This drastically limits the applicability and utility of\nthese models in practice. To resolve this issue, we propose a\nmeta-learning-based method that can efficiently solve P-PDEs with a wide range\nof parameters without retraining. Our key observation is to regard training a\nsolver for the P-PDE with a given set of parameters as a learning task. Then,\ntraining a solver for the P-PDEs with varied parameters can be viewed as a\nmulti-task learning problem, to which meta-learning is one of the most\neffective approaches. This new perspective can be applied to many existing PDE\nsolvers. As an example, we adopt the Multigrid Network (MgNet) as the base\nsolver. To achieve multi-task learning, we introduce a new hypernetwork, called\nMeta-NN, in MgNet and refer to the entire network as the Meta-MgNet. Meta-NN\ntakes the differential operators and the right-hand-side of the underlying\nP-PDEs as inputs and generates appropriate smoothers for MgNet which can\nsignificantly affect the convergent speed. Finally, extensive numerical\nexperiments demonstrate that Meta-MgNet is more efficient in solving P-PDEs\nthan the MG methods and MgNet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 06:13:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 1 Nov 2020 16:21:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-03"}

Second, a gradual language's runtime checks should enforce\nbasic modular type-based invariants expected from the static type discipline.\nTo the contrary, the default operational semantics of AGT may fail to enforce\nsome invariants in surprising ways. We demonstrate this in the\n$\\text{GTFL}_\\lesssim$ language of Garcia et al. [2016].\n  This paper addresses both problems at once by refining the theory underlying\nAGT's dynamic checks. Garcia et al. [2016] observe that AGT involves two\nabstractions of static types: one for the static semantics and one for the\ndynamic semantics. We recast the latter as an abstract interpretation of\nsubtyping itself, while gradual types still abstract static types. Then we show\nhow forward-completeness [Giacobazzi and Quintarelli 2001] is key to supporting\nboth space-efficient execution and reliable runtime type enforcement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 06:32:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 20:22:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-13"}

Different from normal\nchange detection, hyperspectral anomaly change detection (HACD) helps to find\nthose small but important anomaly changes between multi-temporal hyperspectral\nimages (HSI). In previous works, most classical methods use linear regression\nto establish the mapping relationship between two HSIs and then detect the\nanomalies from the residual image. However, the real spectral differences\nbetween multi-temporal HSIs are likely to be quite complex and of nonlinearity,\nleading to the limited performance of these linear predictors. In this paper,\nwe propose an original HACD algorithm based on auto-encoder (ACDA) to give a\nnonlinear solution. The proposed ACDA can construct an effective predictor\nmodel when facing complex imaging conditions. In the ACDA model, two systematic\nauto-encoder (AE) networks are deployed to construct two predictors from two\ndirections. The predictor is used to model the spectral variation of the\nbackground to obtain the predicted image under another imaging condition. Then\nmean square error (MSE) between the predictive image and corresponding expected\nimage is computed to obtain the loss map, where the spectral differences of the\nunchanged pixels are highly suppressed and anomaly changes are highlighted.\nUltimately, we take the minimum of the two loss maps of two directions as the\nfinal anomaly change intensity map.

We consider the presence\nof a passive intruder (eavesdropper) that knows the dynamic model of the system\nand can use the generated information-flow to infer some \"secret\" of the\nsystem. A system is said to be opaque if it always holds the plausible\ndeniability for its secret. Existing notions of opacity only consider secret\neither as currently visiting some secret states or as having visited some\nsecret states in the past. In this paper, we investigate information-flow\nsecurity from a new angle by considering the secret of the system as the\nintention to execute some particular behavior of importance in the future. To\nthis end, we propose a new class of opacity called pre-opacity that\ncharacterizes whether or not the intruder can predict the visit of secret\nstates a certain number of steps ahead before the system actually does so.\nDepending the prediction task of the intruder, we propose two specific kinds of\npre-opacity called K-step instant pre-opacity and K-step trajectory pre-opacity\nto specify this concept.

The\ncomplexity for the verification of pre-opacity is exponential in the size of\nthe system as we show that pre-opacity is inherently PSPACE-hard.

Although existing\ndetection methods consider different categories of fake faces, the performance\non detecting the fake faces with \"unseen\" manipulation techniques is still poor\ndue to the distribution bias among cross-manipulation techniques. To solve this\nproblem, we propose a novel framework that focuses on mining intrinsic features\nand further eliminating the distribution bias to improve the generalization\nability. Firstly, we focus on mining the intrinsic clues in the channel\ndifference image (CDI) and spectrum image (SI) from the camera imaging process\nand the indispensable step in AI manipulation process. Then, we introduce the\nOctave Convolution (OctConv) and an attention-based fusion module to\neffectively and adaptively mine intrinsic features from CDI and SI. Finally, we\ndesign an alignment module to eliminate the bias of manipulation techniques to\nobtain a more generalized detection framework. We evaluate the proposed\nframework on four categories of fake faces datasets with the most popular and\nstate-of-the-art manipulation techniques, and achieve very competitive\nperformances. To further verify the generalization ability of the proposed\nframework, we conduct experiments on cross-manipulation techniques, and the\nresults show the advantages of our method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 08:41:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-28"}

Choosing useful data samples to label while minimizing\nthe cost of labeling is crucial to maintain efficiency in the training process.\nWhen confronted with multiple labelers with different expertise and respective\nlabeling costs, deciding which labeler to choose is nontrivial.

We\nencoded the spatio-temporal activation patterns of mechanoreceptors through\ngray-level co-occurrence matrix computed from time-varying mean spiking\nrate-based tactile response volume. We found that this approach greatly\nimproved texture classification in comparison to use of individual\nmechanoreceptor response alone. In addition, the performance was also more\nrobust to changes in sliding velocity. The importance of exploiting precise\nspatial and temporal correlations between sensory channels is evident from the\nfact that on either removal of precise temporal information or altering of\nspatial structure of response pattern, a significant performance drop was\nobserved. This study thus demonstrates the superiority of population coding\napproaches that can exploit the precise spatio-temporal information encoded in\nactivation patterns of mechanoreceptor populations. It, therefore, makes an\nadvance in the direction of development of bio-inspired tactile systems\nrequired for realistic touch applications in robotics and prostheses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 10:37:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 5 Jun 2021 12:24:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-06"}

Furthermore, the suspension particle\nimage size can strongly deviate from the optimal particle image size for PIV\nmeasurements. Optical accessibility can be achieved by refractive index\nmatching of surface labelled suspension particles. This results in particle\nimages that are transparent in the particle image center, but fluoresce at the\nparticle image rim, resulting in ring-shaped particle images. In the present\nstudy the influence of particle image size of such ring-shaped particle images\nis compared with Gaussian and plateau-shaped particle images. Particles of\nGaussian image shape result from fully labelled particles with small image\ndiameters and are commonly used in PIV measurements. Such particles are also\nutilized for the determination of the continuous phase velocities in the\nexperimental part of the present study. Monte Carlo simulations show that\nring-shaped particle images have a superior behavior, i.e. they assume a\nreduced displacement estimation error for noisy as well as for noise-free image\ndata, compared to Gaussian and plateau-shaped particle images.

In urban road scenarios, the blockage of\nsatellite signals affects precise positing due to erroneous geometry. However,\nfor timing, it creates less deflection as long as a single satellite is\nvisible. With the recent development of Multi-GNSS receivers, signal reception\nno longer relies on a single GNSS constellation but all the existing four GNSS\nsystems. This increases the number of visible satellites in the sky, thus\nincreasing the coverage of satellite signals. Developing a method of GNSS time\nsynchronization, we have conducted a systematic field-based study in this paper\nto determine the attainable timing accuracy in vehicular networks using\ncommercial-grade GNSS receivers and off-the-shelf communication devices. Our\nexperimental results show that the attainable timing accuracy from GNSS\nservices in consumer-grade on-board devices can be as good as 2 microseconds. A\nmomentary outage of GNSS time solution due to signal blockage on the road can\nlead a clock error of up to sub-microseconds, which still meets the desired\nrequirement for most vehicular applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 11:22:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 May 2021 02:33:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-04"}

These could be explained with\nthe presence of two phases of a highly ionized, high column density accretion\ndisk wind outflowing with $v_{out1}\\sim -0.1c$ and $v_{out2}\\sim -0.2c$. Here\nwe present two new observations of MCG-03-58-007: one was carried out in 2016\nwith Chandra and one in 2018 with Swift. Both caught MCG-03-58-007 in a\nbrighter state ($F_{\\mathrm{2-10\\,keV}}\\sim 4\\times 10^{-12}$ erg cm$^{-2}$\ns$^{-1}$) confirming the presence of the fast disk wind. The multi-epoch\nobservations of MCG-03-58-007 covering the period from 2010 to 2018 were then\nanalysed. These data show that the lower velocity component outflowing with\n$v_{out1}\\sim -0.072\\pm 0.002c$ is persistent and detected in all the\nobservations, although it is variable in column density in the range\n$N_\\rm{H}\\sim 3-8 \\times 10^{23}$cm$^{-2}$.

However\nduring the Chandra observation two years earlier, this zone was not present\n($N_\\rm{H}<1.5\\times 10^{23}$cm$^{-2}$), suggesting that this faster zone is\nintermittent. Overall the multi-epochs observations show that the disk wind in\nMCG-03-58-007 is not only powerful, but also extremely variable, hence placing\nMCG-03-58-007 among unique disk winds such as the one seen in the famous QSO\nPDS456. One of the main results of this investigation is the consideration that\nthese winds could be extremely variable, sometime appearing and sometime\ndisappearing; thus to reach solid and firm conclusions about their energetics\nmultiple observations are mandatory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 11:27:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-04"}

However, RSN has been limited to a 1D rigid correction\nwhich is often insufficient for patients with complex respiratory patterns. The\ngoal of this work is therefore to improve the robustness and quality of 3D\nradial CMRA by incorporating both 3D motion information and nonrigid\nintra-acquisition correction of the data into a framework called focused\nnavigation (fNAV). Methods: We applied fNAV to 500 data sets from a numerical\nsimulation, 22 healthy volunteers, and 549 cardiac patients. We compared fNAV\nto RSN and respiratory resolved XD-GRASP reconstructions of the same data and\nrecorded reconstruction times. Motion accuracy was measured as the correlation\nbetween fNAV and ground truth for simulations, and fNAV and image registration\nfor in vivo data. Vessel sharpness was measured using Soap-Bubble. Finally,\nimage quality analysis was performed by a blinded expert reviewer who chose the\nbest image for each data set. Results The reconstruction time for fNAV images\nwas significantly higher than RSN (6.1 +/- 2.1 minutes vs 1.4 +/- 0.3, minutes,\np<0.025) but significantly lower than XD-GRASP (25.6 +/- 7.1, minutes,\np<0.025). There is high correlation between the fNAV, and reference\ndisplacement estimates across all data sets (0.73 +/- 0.29). For all data, fNAV\nlead to significantly sharper vessels than all other reconstructions (p <\n0.01). Finally, a blinded reviewer chose fNAV as the best image in 239 out of\n571 cases (p = 10-5). Conclusion: fNAV is a promising technique for improving\nfree-breathing 3D radial whole-heart CMRA. This novel approach to respiratory\nself-navigation can derive 3D nonrigid motion estimations from an acquired 1D\nsignal yielding statistically significant improvement in image sharpness\nrelative to 1D translational correction as well as XD-GRASP reconstructions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 11:33:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-28"}

It has been customary to assume that all solids\nend up at the center constituting a \"core\" of refractory materials, whereas the\nenvelope remains metal-free. Recent work, as well as observations by the JUNO\nmission, indicate however that the distinction may not be so clear cut. Indeed,\nsmall silicate, pebble-sized particles will sublimate in the atmosphere when\nthey hit the sublimation temperature (T ~ 2,000 K). In this paper we extend\nprevious analytical work to compute the properties of planets under such a\npebble accretion scenario. We conduct 1D numerical calculations of the\natmosphere of an accreting planet, solving the stellar structure equations,\naugmented by a non-ideal equation of state that describes a\nhydrogen/helium-silicate vapor mixture. Calculations terminate at the point\nwhere the total mass in metal equals that of the H/He gas, which we numerically\nconfirm as the onset of runaway gas accretion. When pebbles sublimate before\nreaching the core, insufficient (accretion) energy is available to mix dense,\nvapor-rich lower layers with the higher layers of lower metallicity. A gradual\nstructure in which Z decreases with radius is therefore a natural outcome of\nplanet formation by pebble accretion. We highlight, furthermore, that (small)\npebbles can act as the dominant source of opacity, preventing rapid cooling and\npresenting a channel for (mini-)Neptunes to survive in gas-rich disks.\nNevertheless, once pebble accretion subsides, the atmosphere rapidly clears\nfollowed by runaway gas accretion. We consider atmospheric recycling to be the\nmore probable mechanisms that have stalled the growth of these planets'\nenvelopes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 11:42:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Feb 2021 03:03:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-31"}

The interaction between the gaseous particles of the mixture\nand the thermal reservoir is modeled via a viscous drag force plus a stochastic\nLangevin-like term. The presence of the external bath couples the time\nevolution of the total and partial temperatures of each component allowing the\nappearance of the Mpemba phenomenon, even when the initial temperature\ndifferences are of the same order of the temperatures themselves. Analytical\nresults are obtained by considering multitemperature Maxwellian approximations\nfor the velocity distribution functions of each component.

Here we explore whether and when a full quantum\nrepresentation of the dynamics leads to higher probability to end up in the\ndesired ground when compared to a classical mean field approximation. As\nsimple, nontrivial example we target the ground state of interacting bosons\ntrapped in a tight binding lattice with small local defect by turning on long\nrange interactions.

The classic RMT estimator based on random matrix\ntheory (RMT) tends to under-estimate the number of signals as it does not\nconsider the non-negligible bias term among eigenvalues for finite sample size.\nMoreover, the RMT estimator suffers from uncertainty in noise variance\nestimation problem. In order to overcome these problems, we firstly derive a\nmore accurate expression for the distribution of the sample eigenvalues and the\nbias term among eigenvalues by utilizing the linear shrinkage (LS) estimate of\nnoise sample eigenvalues. Then, we analyze the effect of the bias term among\neigenvalues on the estimation performance of the RMT estimator, and derive the\nincreased under-estimation probability of the RMT estimator incurred by this\nbias term. Based on these results, we propose a novel RMT estimator based on LS\nestimate of noise eigenvalues (termed as LS-RMT estimator) by incorporating the\nbias term into the decision criterion of the RMT estimator. As the LS-RMT\nestimator incorporates this bias term among eigenvalues into the decision\ncriterion of the RMT estimator, it can detect signal eigenvalues immersed in\nthis bias term. Therefore, the LS-RMT estimator can overcome the higher\nunder-estimation probability of the RMT estimator incurred by the bias term\namong eigenvalues, and also avoids the uncertainty in the noise variance\nestimation suffered by the RMT estimator as the noise variance is estimated\nunder the assumption that the eigenvalue being tested is arising from noise.\nFinally, extensive simulation results are presented to show that the proposed\nLS-RMT estimator outperforms the existing estimators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 13:02:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-28"}

However, how to effectively\nleverage translation data and reduce the impact of noise introduced by\ntranslation remains onerous.

A popular approach to delensing entails building a lensing\n$B$-mode template by mimicking the lensing operation, either at gradient order\nor non-perturbatively, using high-resolution $E$-mode observations and some\nproxy of the lensing potential. By explicitly calculating all contributions to\ntwo-loop order in lensing to the power spectrum of $B$-modes delensed with such\na template in the noise-free limit, we are able to show that: (i) corrections\nto the leading-order calculation of the lensing $B$-mode power spectrum only\nenter at the $O(1)\\,\\%$ level because of extensive cancellations between large\nterms at next-to-leading order; (ii) these cancellations would disappear if a\ngradient-order template were to be built from unlensed or delensed $E$-modes,\ngiving rise to a residual delensing floor of $O(10)\\,\\%$ of the original power;\n(iii) new cancellations arise when the lensed $E$-modes are used in the\ngradient-order template, allowing for the delensing floor to be as low as\n$O(1)\\,\\%$ of the original power in practical applications of this method; and\n(iv) these new cancellations would disappear for a non-perturbative template\nconstructed from the lensed $E$-modes, reintroducing a residual delensing floor\nof $O(10)\\,\\%$.

In this work we investigate machine\nlearning-based image analysis as a tool to determine the spatio-temporal extent\nof ice on Swiss Alpine lakes as well as the ice-on and ice-off dates, from both\nmultispectral optical satellite images (VIIRS and MODIS) and RGB webcam images.\nWe model lake ice monitoring as a pixel-wise semantic segmentation problem,\ni.e., each pixel on the lake surface is classified to obtain a spatially\nexplicit map of ice cover. We show experimentally that the proposed system\nproduces consistently good results when tested on data from multiple winters\nand lakes. Our satellite-based method obtains mean Intersection-over-Union\n(mIoU) scores >93%, for both sensors. It also generalises well across lakes and\nwinters with mIoU scores >78% and >80% respectively. On average, our webcam\napproach achieves mIoU values of 87% (approx.) and generalisation scores of 71%\n(approx.) and 69% (approx.) across different cameras and winters respectively.\nAdditionally, we put forward a new benchmark dataset of webcam images\n(Photi-LakeIce) which includes data from two winters and three cameras.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 14:02:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-28"}

There have been a number of\nattempts to extend the theory to treat microcanonical rates. However, the\nprevious formulations are either computationally unfeasible for large systems\ndue to an explicit sum over states or they involve extra approximations which\nmake them less reliable. We propose a robust and practical microcanonical\nformulation called density-of-states instanton theory, which avoids the sum\nover states altogether. In line with the semiclassical approximations inherent\nto the instanton approach, we employ the stationary-phase approximation to the\ninverse Laplace transform to obtain the densities of states. This can be\nevaluated using only post-processing of the data available from a small set of\ninstanton calculations, such that our approach remains computationally\nefficient. We show that the new formulation predicts results that agree well\nwith quantum scattering theory for an atom-diatom reaction and with experiments\nfor a photoexcited unimolecular hydrogen transfer in a Criegee intermediate.\nWhen the thermal rate is evaluated from a Boltzmann average over our new\nmicrocanonical formalism, it can overcome some problems of conventional\ninstanton theory. In particular, it predicts a smooth transition at the\ncrossover temperature and is able to describe bimolecular reactions with\npre-reactive complexes such as CH3OH + OH.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 14:11:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-28"}

Here, we\npresent the first fully self-consistent 1D atmosphere models that take into\naccount the UV irradiation's effect on the object's temperature structure. We\nexplore two BD-WD systems, namely WD-0137-349 and EPIC-212235321.

We explore some\npeculiar aspects of irradiated BD atmospheres and show that existing photometry\ncan be well-fit with our models. Additionally, the detections of atomic\nemission lines from these BDs can be explained by a strong irradiation-induced\ntemperature inversion, similar to inversions recently explored in ultra-hot\nJupiters. Our models of WD-0137-349B can reproduce the observed equivalent\nwidth of many but not all of these atomic lines. We use the observed photometry\nof these objects to retrieve the temperature structure using the PHOENIX\nExoplaneT Retrieval Algorithm (PETRA) and demonstrate that the structures are\nconsistent with our models, albeit somewhat cooler at low pressures. We then\ndiscuss the similarities and differences between this class of irradiated brown\ndwarf and the lower-mass ultra-hot Jupiters.

The repeating FRB121102 is so far the only extra-galactic Fast Radio\nBurst found to be associated with a counterpart, a steady radio source with a\nnearly flat spectral energy distribution (SED) in centimeter wavelengths.\n  Aims. Previous observations of the persistent source down to $1.6$~GHz has\nshown no sign of a spectral turn-over. Absorption is expected to eventually\ncause a turn-over at lower frequencies. Better constraints on the physical\nparameters of the emitting medium can be derived by detecting the\nself-absorption frequency.\n  Methods. We used the Giant Metre-Wave Radio Telescope (GMRT) during the\nperiod of July to December 2017 to observe the source at low radio frequencies\ndown to $400$~MHz.\n  Results. The spectral energy distribution of the source remains optically\nthin even at $400$~MHz, with a spectral index of $\\nu^{-(0.07 \\pm 0.03)}$\nsimilar to what is seen in Galactic plerions. Using a generic synchrotron\nradiation model, we obtain constraints on properties of the non-thermal plasma\nand the central engine powering it.\n  Conclusions. We present low-frequency detections of the persistent source\nassociated with FRB121102. Its characteristic flat SED extends down to\n$400$~MHz. Like Galactic plerions, the energy in the persistent source is\ncarried predominantly by leptons. The emitting plasma has a $B< 0.01$~G, and\nits age is $> 524 \\left(\\frac{B}{0.01 {\\rm G}} \\right)^{-3/2}$. We show that\nthe energetics of the persistent source requires an initial spin period shorter\nthan 36~ms, and the magnetic field of the neutron star must exceed $4.5\\times\n10^{12}$~G. This implies that the persistent source does not necessarily\nrequire energetic input from a magnetar.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 14:50:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-01"}

On a finite state space and in\ndiscrete time, the network allows for unperturbed (or \"deterministic\")\nrandomness that represents the extrinsic noise but also for small intrinsic\nuncertainties modelled by a Markov perturbation. It is shown that if the\ndeterministic random network is synchronized (resp., uniformly synchronized),\nthen for almost all realizations of its extrinsic noise the stochastic\ntrajectories of the perturbed network synchronize along almost all (resp.,\nalong all) time sequences after a certain time, with high probability.

We observed that photocurrent can be\ncontrolled by exciting the sample with different circular and linear polarized\nlight, yielding a polarization-dependent current density which can be fitted\nvery well with a theoretical model. Magnitude of the photocurrent is higher\neven at room temperature, compared to previous reports on other single-crystal\ntopological insulators. Comparison with the theoretical model suggests that\nphotocurrent has different contributions. Study of dependence of photocurrent\non the angle of incidence (wave-vector) of the excitation laser beam with\nrespect to the surface normal of the sample helps to identify origins of\ndifferent terms contributing to the observed photocurrent. Incidence-angle\ndriven helicity switching, which is a very simple and effective technique to\ncontrol the directional photocurrent, has also been observed in this study.\nThis photocurrent can also be controlled with the help of photothermal gradient\ngenerated by the excitation light beam. Enhancement and inversion of this\nphotocurrent in presence of photothermal gradient for light incident on two\nopposite edges of the sample occur due to selective spin state excitation with\ntwo opposite (left and right) circularly polarized light in presence of the\nunique spin-momentum locked surface states.

When confined in a ring, such\nso-called polar active fluids acquire chirality once the spontaneous flow\nchooses a direction. In a perfect ring, this chirality is indefinitely\nlong-lived. Here, we combine experiments on self-propelled colloidal Quincke\nrollers and mesoscopic simulations of continuum Toner-Tu equations to explore\nhow such chiral states can be controlled and manipulated by obstacles. For\ndifferent obstacle geometries three dynamic steady states have been realized:\nlong-lived chiral flow, an apolar state in which the flow breaks up into\ncounter-rotating vortices and an unconventional collective state with flow\nhaving an oscillating chirality. The chirality reversal proceeds through the\nformation of intermittent vortex chains in the vicinity of an obstacle. We\ndemonstrate that the frequency of collective states with oscillating chirality\ncan be tuned by obstacle parameters. We vary obstacle shapes to design chiral\nstates that are independent of initial conditions. Building on our findings, we\nrealize a system with two triangular obstacles that force the active fluid\ntowards a state with a density imbalance of active particles across the ring.\nOur results demonstrate how spontaneous polar active flows in combination with\nsize and geometry of scatterers can be used to control dynamic patterns of\npolar active liquids for materials design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 15:58:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-16"}

Most graph CL methods first perform\nstochastic augmentation on the input graph to obtain two graph views and\nmaximize the agreement of representations in the two views. Despite the\nprosperous development of graph CL methods, the design of graph augmentation\nschemes -- a crucial component in CL -- remains rarely explored. We argue that\nthe data augmentation schemes should preserve intrinsic structures and\nattributes of graphs, which will force the model to learn representations that\nare insensitive to perturbation on unimportant nodes and edges. However, most\nexisting methods adopt uniform data augmentation schemes, like uniformly\ndropping edges and uniformly shuffling features, leading to suboptimal\nperformance. In this paper, we propose a novel graph contrastive representation\nlearning method with adaptive augmentation that incorporates various priors for\ntopological and semantic aspects of the graph. Specifically, on the topology\nlevel, we design augmentation schemes based on node centrality measures to\nhighlight important connective structures. On the node attribute level, we\ncorrupt node features by adding more noise to unimportant node features, to\nenforce the model to recognize underlying semantic information. We perform\nextensive experiments of node classification on a variety of real-world\ndatasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method\nconsistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines and even surpasses\nsome supervised counterparts, which validates the effectiveness of the proposed\ncontrastive framework with adaptive augmentation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 15:12:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2021 07:45:30 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 26 Feb 2021 15:12:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-01"}

A special case is the solid\nelectrolyte interphase (SEI), a heterogeneous multi-component film formed due\nto the instability and subsequent decomposition of the electrolyte at the\nsurface of the anode.
