In recent years, cyber security security user studies have been\nappraised in meta-research, mostly focusing on the completeness of their\nstatistical inferences and the fidelity of their statistical reporting.\nHowever, estimates of the field's distribution of statistical power and its\npublication bias have not received much attention. Aim. In this study, we aim\nto estimate the effect sizes and their standard errors present as well as the\nimplications on statistical power and publication bias. Method. We built upon a\npublished systematic literature review of $146$ user studies in cyber security\n(2006--2016). We took into account $431$ statistical inferences including $t$-,\n$\\chi^2$-, $r$-, one-way $F$-tests, and $Z$-tests. In addition, we coded the\ncorresponding total sample sizes, group sizes and test families. Given these\ndata, we established the observed effect sizes and evaluated the overall\npublication bias. We further computed the statistical power vis-{\\`a}-vis of\nparametrized population thresholds to gain unbiased estimates of the power\ndistribution. Results. We obtained a distribution of effect sizes and their\nconversion into comparable log odds ratios together with their standard errors.\nWe, further, gained funnel-plot estimates of the publication bias present in\nthe sample as well as insights into the power distribution and its\nconsequences. Conclusions. Through the lenses of power and publication bias, we\nshed light on the statistical reliability of the studies in the field. The\nupshot of this introspection is practical recommendations on conducting and\nevaluating studies to advance the field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 2020 16:02:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-06"}

We also show that the\napparent death and release of pigments from one of the phototrophs is\naccompanied by an elevation of the reflectance polarization signal by an order\nof magnitude, which may be significant for remotely detectable environmental\nsignatures. This work and others suggest circular polarization signals up to\n~1% may occur, significantly stronger than previously anticipated circular\npolarization levels.

The result gives\nan approximation to observations that would be obtained if the scattering was\nincoherent. Information from the experiment can therefore be used to\ndistinguish more clearly between long-range inter-adsorbate forces and the\nshort range effects arising from the local lattice potential and associated\nthermal excitations.

These\nmodels are then integrated into a hierarchical Bayesian model that is used to\ninfer the most probable value for the oxygen abundance that is compatible with\nall the observations. The abundance is derived from the [O I] forbidden line at\n6300 {\\AA} taking into consideration all possible nuisance parameters that can\naffect the abundance.\n  Results. Our results show good agreement in the inferred oxygen abundance for\nall the pixels analyzed, demonstrating the robustness of the analysis against\npossible systematic errors in the model. We find a slightly higher oxygen\nabundance in granules than in intergranular lanes when treated separately\n(log(\\epsilon_O) = 8.83 \\pm 0.02 vs log(\\epsilon_O) = 8.76 \\pm 0.02), which is\na difference of approximately 2-{\\sigma}. This tension suggests that some\nsystematic errors in the model or the radiative transfer still exist but are\nsmall. When taking all pixels together, we obtain an oxygen abundance of\nlog(\\epsilon_O)=8.80 \\pm 0.03, which is compatible with both granules and lanes\nwithin 1-{\\sigma}. The spread of results is due to both systematic and random\nerrors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 2020 16:57:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-18"}

To enable the\nsharing, local coordinate systems of the underlying 6D ego-pose trackers,\nrunning independently on each set of glasses, have to be spatially and\ntemporally aligned with respect to each other. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel lightweight solution for this problem, which is referred as ego-motion\nalignment. We show that detecting each other's face or glasses together with\ntracker ego-poses sufficiently conditions the problem to spatially relate local\ncoordinate systems. Importantly, the detected glasses can serve as reliable\nanchors to bring sufficient accuracy for the targeted practical use. The\nproposed idea allows us to abandon the traditional visual localization step\nwith fiducial markers or scene points as anchors.

Under such\nhighly non-perturbative conditions, the frequency at which the spin oscillates\nbetween states, the Rabi frequency, becomes comparable to its natural resonance\nfrequency, the Larmor frequency. For such conditions, we develop an intuitive\nunderstanding of the emergence of hybrid light-matter states, illustrating how\ndipole-forbidden multiple-quantum transitions at integer and fractional\ng-factors arise. A rigorous theoretical treatment of the phenomena comes from a\nFloquet-style solution to the time-dependent Hamiltonian of the electron-hole\nspin pair under resonant drive. To probe these phenomena experimentally\nrequires both the development of a magnetic-resonance setup capable of\nsupporting oscillating driving fields comparable in magnitude to the static\nfield defining the Zeeman splitting; and an organic semiconductor which is\ncharacterized by minimal inhomogeneous broadening so as to allow the non-linear\nlight-matter interactions to be resolved. The predicted exotic resonance\nfeatures associated with the Floquet states are indeed found experimentally in\nmeasurements of spin-dependent steady-state OLED current under resonant drive,\ndemonstrating that complex hybrid light-matter spin excitations can be formed\nand probed at room temperature. The spin-Dicke state arising under strong drive\nis insensitive to power broadening so that the Bloch-Siegert shift of the\nresonance becomes apparent, implying long coherence times of the dressed spin\nstate with potential applicability for quantum sensing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 2020 17:18:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-17"}

For over 100 years,\nscholars of social contagion have almost exclusively made the same implicit\nassumption: that only one belief, idea, or practice spreads through the\npopulation at a time. It is a default assumption that we don't bother to state,\nlet alone justify. The assumption is so ingrained that our literature doesn't\neven have a word for \"whatever is to be diffused\", because we have never needed\nto discuss more than one of them. But this assumption is obviously false.\nMillions of beliefs, ideas, and practices (let's call them \"diffusants\") spread\nthrough social contagion every day. To assume that diffusants spread one at a\ntime - or more generously, that they spread independently of one another - is\nto assume that interactions between diffusants have no influence on adoption\npatterns. This could be true, or it could be wildly off the mark. We've never\nstopped to find out. This paper makes a direct comparison between the spread of\nindependent and interdependent beliefs using simulations, observational data,\nand a 2400-subject laboratory experiment. I find that in assuming independence\nbetween diffusants, scholars have overlooked social processes that\nfundamentally change the outcomes of social contagion. Interdependence between\nbeliefs generates polarization, irrespective of social network structure,\nhomophily, demographics, politics, or any other commonly cited cause. It also\ncoordinates structures of beliefs that can have both internal justification and\nsocial support without any grounding in external truth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 2020 17:45:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 21 Jan 2021 16:54:48 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 1 Jun 2021 14:35:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-02"}

Does the answer depend on whether the\nphoton is ultimately absorbed or transmitted? In particular, if it is\n$\\textit{not}$ absorbed, does it cause atoms to spend any time in the excited\nstate, and if so, how much? In an experiment with ultra-cold Rubidium atoms, we\nsimultaneously record whether atoms are excited by incident (\"signal\") photons\nand whether those photons are transmitted. We measure the time spent by atoms\nin the excited state by using a separate, off-resonant \"probe\" laser to monitor\nthe index of refraction of the sample - that is, we measure the nonlinear phase\nshift written by a signal pulse on this probe beam - and use direct detection\nto isolate the effect of single transmitted photons. For short pulses (10 ns,\nto be compared to the 26 ns atomic lifetime) and an optically thick medium\n(peak OD = 4, leading to 60% absorption given our broad bandwidth), we find\nthat the average time atoms spend in the excited state due to one transmitted\nphoton is not zero, but rather (77 $\\pm$ 16)% of the time the average incident\nphoton causes them to spend in the excited state.

The process of dark matter stripping is responsible for\nthe large scatter in the halo-to-stellar mass relation in the dwarf regime. The\ndegree of stripping is driven by the closeness of the orbit of the dwarf around\nits massive companion and, in extreme cases, produces dwarfs with\nhalo-to-stellar mass ratios as low as unity, consistent with the findings of\nrecent observational studies. ~30 per cent of dwarfs show some deviation from\nnormal dark matter fractions due to dark matter stripping, with 10 per cent\nshowing high levels of dark matter deficiency (Mhalo/M*<10).

An excess of gamma rays (GCE) has been measured by\nseveral groups in the data collected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT)\ntowards the Galactic center region. The spectrum and spatial morphology of the\nGCE have been claimed by some groups to be compatible with a signal from the\nGalactic halo of dark matter (DM). Instead, other analyses have demonstrated\nthat the GCE properties, e.g., its energy spectrum, highly depend on the choice\nof the Galactic interstellar emission (IEM) model source catalogs and analysis\ntechniques. In this paper we investigate the sensitivity of Fermi-LAT to detect\nthe characteristics of the GCE. In particular we simulate the GCE as given by\nDM and we verify that, with a perfect knowledge of the background components,\nits energy spectrum, position, spatial morphology and symmetry is properly\nmeasured. We also inspect two more realist cases for which there are\nimperfections in the IEM model. In the first we have an un-modeled gamma-ray\nsource, constituted by the low-latitude component of the Fermi bubbles. In the\nsecond we simulate the data with one IEM template and analyze the data with an\nother. We verify that a mismodeling of the IEM introduces a systematics of\nabout 10-15% in the GCE energy spectrum between 1-10 GeV and about 5% in the\nvalue of the slope for a NFW DM density profile, which is used to fit the GCE\nspatial morphology. Finally, we show how the GCE would be detected in case of\nalternative processes such as gamma-ray emission from a bulge population of\npulsars or from electrons and positrons or protons injected from the Galactic\ncenter. We demonstrate that for each of these cases there is a distinctive\nsmoking gun signature that would help to identify the real mechanism behind the\norigin of the GCE.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 2020 18:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-18"}

These efforts have proved useful in some instances by allowing decision\nmakers to distinguish different scenarios during the emergency, but their\naccuracy has been disappointing, forecasts ignore uncertainties and less\nattention is given to local areas.

Although these detections were limited to the first\nquadrant of the Galaxy, the existing data suggest that ArH+ ubiquitously and\nexclusively probes the diffuse atomic regions of the ISM. In this study, we\nextend the coverage of ArH+ to other parts of the Galaxy with new observations\nof its J = 1-0 transition along seven Galactic sight lines towards bright\nsub-mm continuum sources. We aim to benchmark its efficiency as a tracer of\npurely atomic gas by evaluating its correlation (or lack there of) with other\nwell-known atomic and molecular gas tracers. The observations of ArH+ near\n617.5 GHz were made feasible with the new, sensitive SEPIA660 receiver on the\nAPEX 12 m telescope. The two sidebands of this receiver allowed us to observe\np-H2O+ transitions of at 607.227 GHz simultaneously with the ArH+ line. By\nanalysing the steady state chemistry of OH+ and o-H2O+, we derive on average a\ncosmic-ray ionisation rate (CRIR), of 2.3e-16 s^-1 towards the sight lines\nstudied in this work. Using the derived values of the CRIR and the observed\nArH+ abundances we constrain the molecular fraction of the gas traced by ArH+\nto lie below 2e-2 with a median value of 8.8e-4. Combined, our observations of\nArH+, OH+, H2O+, and CH probe different regimes of the ISM, from diffuse atomic\nto diffuse and translucent molecular clouds. Over Galactic scales, we see that\nthe distribution of N(ArH+) is associated with that of N(H), particularly in\nthe inner Galaxy with potentially even contributions from the warm neutral\nmedium phase of atomic gas at larger galactocentric distances. We derive an\naverage o/p-ratio for H2O+ of 2.1, which corresponds to a nuclear spin\ntemperature of 41 K, consistent with the typical gas temperatures of diffuse\nclouds.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 2020 18:12:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-11"}

If\ngenuine, a deeper absorption may lead to stronger fluctuations on the 21-cm\nsignal on degree scales (up to 1~Kelvin in rms), allowing these fluctuations to\nbe detectable in nearly 50~times shorter integration times compared to previous\npredictions. We commenced the \"AARTFAAC Cosmic Explorer\" (ACE) program, that\nemploys the AARTFAAC wide-field imager, to measure or set limits on the power\nspectrum of the 21-cm fluctuations in the redshift range $z = 17.9-18.6$\n($\\Delta\\nu = 72.36-75.09$~MHz) corresponding to the deep part of the EDGES\nabsorption feature.

These data\nalso show that the duration of this epoch of stalled spin-down increases toward\nlower masses. To determine when stalled stars resume spinning down, we use data\nfrom the $K2$ mission and the Palomar Transient Factory to measure\n$P_\\text{rot}$ for 58 dwarf members of the 2.7-Gyr-old cluster Ruprecht 147, 39\nof which satisfy our criteria designed to remove short-period or\nnear-equal-mass binaries. Combined with the $Kepler$ $P_\\text{rot}$ data for\nthe approximately coeval cluster NGC 6819 (30 stars with $M_\\star > 0.85$\nM$_\\odot$), our new measurements more than double the number of $\\approx$2.5\nGyr benchmark rotators and extend this sample down to $\\approx$0.55 M$_\\odot$.\nThe slowly rotating sequence for this joint sample appears relatively flat (22\n$\\pm$ 2 days) compared to sequences for younger clusters. This sequence also\nintersects the $Kepler$ intermediate period gap, demonstrating that this gap\nwas not created by a lull in star formation.

Further, our approach does not\nrequire an initial system identification step, resulting in a relatively simple\nand efficient learning process. Reservoir computers are well-suited to the\ncontrol problem because they require small training data sets and remarkably\nlow training times. By iteratively training and adding layers of reservoir\ncomputers to the controller, a precise and efficient control law is identified\nquickly.

In complex applications, or\nautomated data collection, these feature sets are not known a priori, and need\nto be determined. This work proposes a class of latent factor models on the\nobserved high-dimensional random vector $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^p$, for defining,\nidentifying and estimating the index set of its approximately replicate\ncomponents. The model class is parametrized by a $p \\times K$ loading matrix\n$A$ that contains a hidden sub-matrix whose rows can be partitioned into groups\nof parallel vectors. Under this model class, a set of approximate replicate\ncomponents of $X$ corresponds to a set of parallel rows in $A$: these entries\nof $X$ are, up to scale and additive error, the same linear combination of the\n$K$ latent factors; the value of $K$ is itself unknown. The problem of finding\napproximate replicates in $X$ reduces to identifying, and estimating, the\nlocation of the hidden sub-matrix within $A$, and of the partition of its row\nindex set $H$. Both $H$ and its partiton can be fully characterized in terms of\na new family of criteria based on the correlation matrix of $X$, and their\nidentifiability, as well as that of the unknown latent dimension $K$, are\nobtained as consequences. The constructive nature of the identifiability\narguments enables computationally efficient procedures, with consistency\nguarantees.

Sometimes it is of value to\nsimultaneously test for each $j$, which is more commonly known as variable\nselection. The conditional randomization test (CRT) and model-X knockoffs are\ntwo recently proposed methods that respectively perform conditional\nindependence testing and variable selection by, for each $X_j$, computing any\ntest statistic on the data and assessing that test statistic's significance by\ncomparing it to test statistics computed on synthetic variables generated using\nknowledge of $X$'s distribution.

In SeqMix, we address this challenge\nby performing mixup for both sequences and token-level labels of the queried\nsamples. Furthermore, we design a discriminator during sequence mixup, which\njudges whether the generated sequences are plausible or not. Our experiments on\nNamed Entity Recognition and Event Detection tasks show that SeqMix can improve\nthe standard active sequence labeling method by $2.27\\%$--$3.75\\%$ in terms of\n$F_1$ scores.

As much as possible, the model\nconstruction is based on first principles, but such that the model is\nconsistent with experimental observations. We require that tension in the\nleaflets must support a pressure, then derive a system of partial differential\nequations governing its mechanical equilibrium. The solution to these\ndifferential equations is referred to as the predicted loaded configuration; it\nincludes the loaded leaflet geometry, fiber orientations and tensions needed to\nsupport the prescribed load. From this configuration, we derive a reference\nconfiguration and constitutive law. In fluid-structure interaction simulations\nwith the immersed boundary method, the model seals reliably under physiological\npressures, and opens freely over multiple cardiac cycles. Further, model\nclosure is robust to extreme hypo- and hypertensive pressures. Then, exploiting\nthe unique features of this model construction, we conduct experiments on\nreference configurations, constitutive laws, and gross morphology. These\nexperiments suggest the following conclusions, which are directly applicable to\nthe design of prosthetic aortic valves. (i) The loaded geometry, tensions and\ntangent moduli primarily determine model function.

Much of the literature (with several recent exceptions) of learning\nwith noisy labels focuses on the case when the label noise is independent of\nfeatures. Practically, annotations errors tend to be instance-dependent and\noften depend on the difficulty levels of recognizing a certain task. Applying\nexisting results from instance-independent settings would require a significant\namount of estimation of noise rates. Therefore, providing theoretically\nrigorous solutions for learning with instance-dependent label noise remains a\nchallenge.

Prior works in lottery\ntickets have primarily focused on the supervised learning setup, with several\npapers proposing effective ways of finding \"winning tickets\" in classification\nproblems. In this paper, we confirm the existence of winning tickets in deep\ngenerative models such as GANs and VAEs. We show that the popular iterative\nmagnitude pruning approach (with late rewinding) can be used with generative\nlosses to find the winning tickets. This approach effectively yields tickets\nwith sparsity up to 99% for AutoEncoders, 93% for VAEs and 89% for GANs on\nCIFAR and Celeb-A datasets. We also demonstrate the transferability of winning\ntickets across different generative models (GANs and VAEs) sharing the same\narchitecture, suggesting that winning tickets have inductive biases that could\nhelp train a wide range of deep generative models. Furthermore, we show the\npractical benefits of lottery tickets in generative models by detecting tickets\nat very early stages in training called \"early-bird tickets\". Through\nearly-bird tickets, we can achieve up to 88% reduction in floating-point\noperations (FLOPs) and 54% reduction in training time, making it possible to\ntrain large-scale generative models over tight resource constraints. These\nresults out-perform existing early pruning methods like SNIP (Lee, Ajanthan,\nand Torr 2019) and GraSP (Wang, Zhang, and Grosse 2020).

We report the discovery of 38 new\nZZ Ceti stars, including two very rare ultra-massive pulsators. We also\nidentified 5 possibly variable stars within the strip, in addition to 47\nobjects that do not appear to show any photometric variability. However,\nseveral of those could be variable with an amplitude below our detection\nthreshold, or could be located outside the instability strip due to errors in\ntheir photometric parameters. In the light of our results, we explore the\ntrends of the dominant period and amplitude in the $M - T_{\\rm eff}$ plane, and\nbriefly discuss the question of the purity of the ZZ Ceti instability strip\n(i.e. a region devoid of non-variable stars).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 2020 22:44:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-18"}

For a data set of size $n$, our data\nstructure supports a batch of insertions or deletions of size $m$ in\n$O(m(1+\\log ((n+m)/m)))$ expected work and $O(\\log (n+m)\\log^*(n+m))$ depth\nwith high probability, and takes linear space. The key techniques for achieving\nthese bounds are a new work-efficient parallel batch-dynamic binary heap, and\ncareful management of the computation across sets of points to minimize work\nand depth.\n  We provide an optimized multicore implementation of our data structure using\ndynamic hash tables, parallel heaps, and dynamic $k$-d trees.

On 48 cores with hyper-threading, the\nstatic algorithms achieve up to 51.45x (29.42x on average) speedup, and Rabin's\nalgorithm performs the best on average. Comparing our dynamic algorithm to the\nfastest static algorithm, we find that it is advantageous to use the dynamic\nalgorithm for batch sizes of up to 20\\% of the data set.

We present BVOT, a self-tallying boardroom voting\nprotocol with ballot secrecy, fairness (no tally information is available\nbefore the polls close), and dispute-freeness (voters can observe that all\nvoters correctly followed the protocol).\n  BVOT works by using a multiparty threshold homomorphic encryption system in\nwhich each candidate is associated with a masked unique prime. Each voter\nengages in an oblivious transfer with an untrusted distributor: the voter\nselects the index of a prime associated with a candidate and receives the\nselected prime in masked form. The voter then casts their vote by encrypting\ntheir masked prime and broadcasting it to everyone. The distributor does not\nlearn the voter's choice, and no one learns the mapping between primes and\ncandidates until the audit phase. By hiding the mapping between primes and\ncandidates, BVOT provides voters with insufficient information to carry out\neffective cheating. The threshold feature prevents anyone from computing any\npartial tally---until everyone has voted. Multiplying all votes, their\ndecryption shares, and the unmasking factor yields a product of the primes each\nraised to the number of votes received.\n  In contrast to some existing boardroom voting protocols, BVOT does not rely\non any zero-knowledge proof; instead, it uses oblivious transfer to assure\nballot secrecy and correct vote casting. Also, BVOT can handle multiple\ncandidates in one election. BVOT prevents cheating by hiding crucial\ninformation: an attempt to increase the tally of one candidate might increase\nthe tally of another candidate.

We probe five transformer-based QA models trained on two QA\ndatasets, along with their underlying language models. Our broad study reveals\nthat (1) all these models, with and without fine-tuning, have notable\nstereotyping biases in these classes; (2) larger models often have higher bias;\nand (3) the effect of fine-tuning on bias varies strongly with the dataset and\nthe model size.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2020 01:49:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 7 Oct 2020 04:51:22 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 10 Oct 2020 01:48:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-13"}

These architectures enable faster\ninferences and could bring DNNs to low-power devices, e.g., in the Internet of\nThings (IoT). However, it is unknown if the computational savings provided by\nthis approach are robust against adversarial pressure. In particular, an\nadversary may aim to slowdown adaptive DNNs by increasing their average\ninference time$-$a threat analogous to the $denial$-$of$-$service$ attacks from\nthe Internet. In this paper, we conduct a systematic evaluation of this threat\nby experimenting with three generic multi-exit DNNs (based on VGG16, MobileNet,\nand ResNet56) and a custom multi-exit architecture, on two popular image\nclassification benchmarks (CIFAR-10 and Tiny ImageNet). To this end, we show\nthat adversarial example-crafting techniques can be modified to cause slowdown,\nand we propose a metric for comparing their impact on different architectures.\nWe show that a slowdown attack reduces the efficacy of multi-exit DNNs by\n90-100%, and it amplifies the latency by 1.5-5$\\times$ in a typical IoT\ndeployment. We also show that it is possible to craft universal, reusable\nperturbations and that the attack can be effective in realistic black-box\nscenarios, where the attacker has limited knowledge about the victim. Finally,\nwe show that adversarial training provides limited protection against\nslowdowns. These results suggest that further research is needed for defending\nmulti-exit architectures against this emerging threat.

In the absence of geometric\nsymmetries the tuning of at least one structural parameter will be necessary to\nachieve reflectionless excitation. The theory employs a recently identified set\nof complex-frequency solutions of the Maxwell equations as a starting point,\nwhich are defined by having zero reflection into a chosen set of input\nchannels, and which are referred to as R-zeros.

We develop the general upper bound on estimation error for TTOI with\nthe support of several new representation lemmas on tensor matricizations. By\ndeveloping a matching information-theoretic lower bound, we also prove that\nTTOI achieves the minimax optimality under the spiked tensor model. The merits\nof the proposed TTOI are illustrated through applications to estimation and\ndimension reduction of high-order Markov processes, numerical studies, and a\nreal data example on New York City taxi travel records. The software of the\nproposed algorithm is available online$^6$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2020 05:18:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 24 Jan 2022 21:45:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-26"}

We show that\n\"polynomial process\" universally means \"affine drift\". Simple assumptions on\nthe polynomial action operators lead to stronger characterisations on the\npolynomial class of processes.\n  In our framework we do not need to specify polynomials explicitly but can\nwork with a general sequence of graded vector spaces of functions on the state\nspace. Elements of these graded vector spaces form the monomials by introducing\na sequence of vector space complements. The basic tool of our analysis is the\npolynomial action operator, which is a semigroup of operators mapping\nconditional expected values of monomials acting on the polynomial process to\nmonomials of the same or lower grade. Unlike the classical Euclidean case, the\npolynomial action operator may not form a finite-dimensional subspace after a\nfinite iteration, a property we call locally finite. We study abstract\npolynomial processes under both algebraic and topological assumptions on the\npolynomial actions, and establish an affine drift structure. Moreover, we\ncharacterize the covariance structure under similar but slightly stronger\nconditions. A crucial part in our analysis is the use of the (algebraic or\ntopological) dual of the monomials of grade one, which serves as a\nlinearization of the state space of the polynomial process.

However, the motion information contained in a blurry\nimage has yet to be fully explored and accurately formulated because: (i) the\nground truth of dynamic motion is difficult to obtain; (ii) the temporal\nordering is destroyed during the exposure; and (iii) the motion estimation from\na blurry image is highly ill-posed. By revisiting the principle of camera\nexposure, motion blur can be described by the relative motions of sharp content\nwith respect to each exposed position. In this paper, we define exposure\ntrajectories, which represent the motion information contained in a blurry\nimage and explain the causes of motion blur. A novel motion offset estimation\nframework is proposed to model pixel-wise displacements of the latent sharp\nimage at multiple timepoints. Under mild constraints, our method can recover\ndense, (non-)linear exposure trajectories, which significantly reduce temporal\ndisorder and ill-posed problems. Finally, experiments demonstrate that the\nrecovered exposure trajectories not only capture accurate and interpretable\nmotion information from a blurry image, but also benefit motion-aware image\ndeblurring and warping-based video extraction tasks.

Knowledge of target\nshape is a fundamental need for RT. Without such information to guide\nradiation, normal tissue can be irradiated unnecessarily, leading to\nexperimental uncertainties. Recognition of this need led us to develop\nquantitative bioluminescence tomography (QBLT), which provides strong imaging\ncontrast to localize optical targets. We demonstrated its capability of guiding\nconformal RT using an orthotopic bioluminescent glioblastoma (GBM) model. With\nmulti-projection and multi-spectral bioluminescence imaging and a novel\nspectral derivative method, our QBLT system is able to reconstruct GBM with\nlocalization accuracy <1mm. An optimal threshold was determined to delineate\nQBLT reconstructed gross target volume (GTV_{QBLT}), which provides the best\noverlap between the GTV_{QBLT} and CBCT contrast labeled GBM (GTV), used as the\nground truth for the GBM volume. To account for the uncertainty of QBLT in\ntarget localization and volume delineation, we also innovated a margin design;\na 0.5mm margin was determined and added to GTV_{QBLT} to form a planning target\nvolume (PTV_{QBLT}), which largely improved tumor coverage from 75% (0mm\nmargin) to 98% and the corresponding variation (n=10) of the tumor coverage was\nsignificantly reduced.

A\nnatural way for dealing with these problems is to extend the constrained\noptimization problem as the one optimizing the objective function over the set\nof points with the least constraint violation. Firstly, the minimization\nproblem with least constraint violation is proved to be an Lipschitz equality\nconstrained optimization problem when the original problem is a convex\noptimization problem with possible inconsistent conic constraints, and it can\nbe reformulated as an MPEC problem. Secondly, for nonlinear programming\nproblems with possible inconsistent constraints, various types of stationary\npoints are presented for the MPCC problem which is equivalent to the\nminimization problem with least constraint violation, and an elegant necessary\noptimality condition, named as L-stationary condition, is established from the\nclassical optimality theory of Lipschitz continuous optimization.

The\nmodel is configured with typical coronal environment of tenuous gas governed by\nstrong magnetic field, and thus its lower boundary is set at the base of the\ncorona, but driven by magnetic fields observed in the photosphere. A previous\nassessment of the model using data from a flux emergence simulation (FES)\nshowed that the DARE failed to reproduce the coronal magnetic field in the FES,\nwhich is attributed to the fact that the photospheric data in the FES has a\nvery strong Lorentz force and therefore spurious flows are generated in the\nDARE model. Here we further test the DARE by using three sets of data from the\nFES sliced at incremental heights, which correspond to the photosphere, the\nchromosphere and the base of the corona. It is found that the key difference in\nthe three sets of data is the extent of the Lorentz force, which makes the\ndata-driven model perform very differently. At the two higher levels above the\nphotosphere, the Lorentz force decreases substantially, and the DARE model\nattains results in much better agreement with the FES, confirming that the\nLorentz force in the boundary data is a key issue affecting the results of the\nDARE model. However, unlike the FES data, the photospheric field from SDO/HMI\nobservations has recently been found to be very close to force-free. Therefore,\nwe suggest that it is still reasonable to use the photospheric magnetic field\nas approximation of the field at the coronal base to drive the DARE model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2020 05:58:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-04"}

State-of-the-art lifelong language learning methods store\npast examples in episodic memory and replay them at both training and inference\ntime. However, as we show later in our experiments, there are three significant\nimpediments: (1) needing unrealistically large memory module to achieve good\nperformance, (2) suffering from negative transfer, (3) requiring multiple local\nadaptation steps for each test example that significantly slows down the\ninference speed. In this paper, we identify three common principles of lifelong\nlearning methods and propose an efficient meta-lifelong framework that combines\nthem in a synergistic fashion. To achieve sample efficiency, our method trains\nthe model in a manner that it learns a better initialization for local\nadaptation. Extensive experiments on text classification and question answering\nbenchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance using merely 1% memory size and narrowing the gap\nwith multi-task learning. We further show that our method alleviates both\ncatastrophic forgetting and negative transfer at the same time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2020 06:08:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-07"}

Importance weighting, as a natural and\nprinciple strategy to adjust for covariate shift, has been commonly used in the\nfield of transfer learning. However, this strategy is not robust to model\nmisspecification or excessive estimation error. In this paper, we propose an\naugmented transfer regression learning (ATReL) approach that introduces an\nimputation model for the targeted response, and uses it to augment the\nimportance weighting equation. With novel semi-non-parametric constructions and\ncalibrated moment estimating equations for the two nuisance models, our ATReL\nmethod is less prone to (i) the curse of dimensionality compared to\nnonparametric approaches, and (ii) model mis-specification than parametric\napproaches. We show that our ATReL estimator is root-n-consistent when at least\none nuisance model is correctly specified, estimation for the parametric part\nof the nuisance models achieves parametric rate, and the nonparametric\ncomponents are rate doubly robust. Simulation studies demonstrate that our\nmethod is more robust and efficient than existing parametric and fully\nnonparametric (machine learning) estimators under various configurations. We\nalso examine the utility of our method through a real example about transfer\nlearning of phenotyping algorithm for rheumatoid arthritis across different\ntime windows.

PCAL aims to mask the private information inside the original\ndataset, while maintaining the important utility information for the target\nprediction task performance, by (iteratively) weighing between a privacy-risk\nloss and a utility-oriented loss. PCAL is compared against off-the-shelf\noptions in terms of both utility and privacy protection. Results indicate that\nPCAL can learn an effective, privacy-free representation from user data,\nproviding a solid foundation towards privacy-preserving machine learning for\ncredit risk analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2020 07:04:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-07"}

However, the\nmodel requires a motor to generate the loops, and although cohesin is a strong\ncandidate for the extruding factor, a suitable motor protein (or a motor\nactivity in cohesin itself) has yet to be found. Here we explore a new\nhypothesis: that there is no motor, and thermal motion within the nucleus\ndrives extrusion. Using theoretical modelling and computer simulations we ask\nwhether such diffusive extrusion could feasibly generate loops. Our simulations\nuncover an interesting ratchet effect (where an osmotic pressure promotes loop\ngrowth), and suggest, by comparison to recent in vitro and in vivo\nmeasurements, that diffusive extrusion can in principle generate loops of the\nsize observed in the data.\n  Extra View on : C.

In addition to the millions of stars,\nthousands of Solar System Objects (SSOs) are observed daily. By comparing their\npositions to those of known objects, a daily processing pipeline filters known\nobjects from potential discoveries. However, owing to Gaia's specific scanning\nlaw designed for stars, potential newly discovered moving objects are\ncharacterized by very few observations, acquired over a limited time. This\naspect was recognized early in the design of the Gaia data processing. A daily\nprocessing pipeline dedicated to these candidate discoveries was set up to\nrelease calls for observations to a network of ground-based telescopes. Their\naim is to acquire follow-up astrometry and to characterize these objects. From\nthe astrometry measured by Gaia, preliminary orbital solutions are determined,\nallowing to predict the position of these potentially new discovered objects in\nthe sky accounting for the large parallax between Gaia and the Earth (separated\nby 0.01 au). A specific task within the Gaia Consortium has been responsible\nfor the distribution of requests for follow-up observations of potential Gaia\nSSO discoveries. Since late 2016, these calls for observations (called alerts)\nare published daily via a Web interface, freely available to anyone world-wide.\nBetween November 2016 and July 2020, over 1700 alerts have been published,\nleading to the successful recovery of more than 200 objects. Among those, six\nhave provisional designation assigned with the Gaia observations, the others\nbeing previously known objects with poorly characterized orbits, precluding\nidentification at the time of Gaia observations. There is a clear trend for\nobjects with a high inclination to be unidentified, revealing a clear bias in\nthe current census of SSOs against high inclination populations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2020 08:58:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-21"}

Moreover, we propose a\ndisentangle-based continual graph representation learning (DiCGRL) framework\ninspired by the human's ability to learn procedural knowledge. The experimental\nresults show that DiCGRL could effectively alleviate the catastrophic\nforgetting problem and outperform state-of-the-art continual learning models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2020 09:20:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 13 Nov 2020 05:34:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2020 08:21:52 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2020 06:33:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-25"}

When\nplanetesimals form in protoplanetary discs, their orbits are nearly circular\nand planar due to the effect of gas drag. However, mutual close encounters of\nthe planetesimals increase eccentricities and inclinations until an equilibrium\nbetween stirring and damping is reached. After disc dissipation, there is no\nmore gas drag and mutual close encounters as well as encounters with planets\nstir the orbits again. The high number of planetesimals in protoplanetary discs\nrenders it difficult to simulate their dynamics by means of direct N-body\nsimulations of planet formation. Therefore, we developed a novel method for the\ndynamical evolution of planetesimals that is based on following close\nencounters between planetesimal-mass bodies and gravitational stirring by\nplanet-mass bodies. To separate the orbital motion from the close encounters,\nwe employ a Hamiltonian splitting scheme as used in symplectic N-body\nintegrators. Close encounters are identified using a cell algorithm with linear\nscaling in the number of bodies. A grouping algorithm is used to create small\ngroups of interacting bodies which are integrated separately. Our method allows\nsimulating a high number of planetesimals interacting through gravity and\ncollisions with low computational cost. The typical computational time is of\nthe order of minutes or hours, up to a few days for more complex simulations,\nas compared to several hours or even weeks for the same setup with full N-body.\nThe dynamical evolution of the bodies is sufficiently well reproduced. This\nwill make it possible to study the growth of planetesimals through collisions\nand pebble accretion coupled to their dynamics for a much higher number of\nbodies than previously accessible with full N-body simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2020 10:28:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-25"}

We propose a comprehensive pruning strategy that can\nperform both width-wise as well as depth-wise pruning.

Inspired by these methods, we propose an\napproach to obtaining spatial and colour tuning curves for convolutional\nneurons, which can be used to classify cells in terms of their spatial and\ncolour opponency. We perform these classifications for a range of CNNs with\ndifferent depths and bottleneck widths. Our key finding is that networks with a\nbottleneck show a strong functional organisation: almost all cells in the\nbottleneck layer become both spatially and colour opponent, cells in the layer\nfollowing the bottleneck become non-opponent. The colour tuning data can\nfurther be used to form a rich understanding of how colour is encoded by a\nnetwork. As a concrete demonstration, we show that shallower networks without a\nbottleneck learn a complex non-linear colour system, whereas deeper networks\nwith tight bottlenecks learn a simple channel opponent code in the bottleneck\nlayer. We further develop a method of obtaining a hue sensitivity curve for a\ntrained CNN which enables high level insights that complement the low level\nfindings from the colour tuning data. We go on to train a series of networks\nunder different conditions to ascertain the robustness of the discussed\nresults. Ultimately, our methods and findings coalesce with prior art,\nstrengthening our ability to interpret trained CNNs and furthering our\nunderstanding of the connection between architecture and learned\nrepresentation.

The intensity of the\nTTFields within the tumor was associated with the treatment outcomes: the\nlarger the intensity the longer the patients are likely to survive. Therefore,\nit was suggested to optimize TTFields transducer array location such that their\nintensity is maximized. Such optimization requires multiple computations of\nTTFields in a simulation framework. However, these computations are typically\nperformed using finite element methods or similar approaches that are time\nconsuming. Therefore, only a limited number of transducer array locations can\nbe examined in practice. To overcome this issue, we have developed a method for\nfast estimation of TTFields intensity. We have designed and implemented a\nmethod that inputs a segmentation of the patients head, a table of tissues\nelectrical properties and the location of the transducer array. The method\noutputs a spatial estimation of the TTFields intensity by incorporating a few\nrelevant parameters in a random-forest regressor. The method was evaluated on\n10 patients (20 TA layouts) in a leave-one-out framework. The computation time\nwas 1.5 minutes using the suggested method, and 180-240 minutes using the\ncommercial simulation. The average error was 0.14 V/cm (SD = 0.06 V/cm) in\ncomparison to the result of the commercial simulation.

This method solves a sequence of inner\nsubproblems which can be enforced to be strongly convex and which therefore\nadmit a unique solution. The resulting steps are shown to be equivalent to\ninexact proximal point iterations on the extended-real-valued cost function,\nwhich allows for a fairly simple analysis where convergence to a stationary\npoint at an \\(R\\)-linear rate is shown. The QPALM algorithm solves the\nsubproblems iteratively using semismooth Newton directions and an exact\nlinesearch. The former can be computed efficiently in most iterations by making\nuse of suitable factorization update routines, while the latter requires the\nzero of a monotone, one-dimensional, piecewise affine function. QPALM is\nimplemented in open-source C code, with tailored linear algebra routines for\nthe factorization in a self-written package LADEL. The resulting implementation\nis shown to be extremely robust in numerical simulations, solving all of the\nMaros-Meszaros problems and finding a stationary point for most of the\nnonconvex QPs in the Cutest test set. Furthermore, it is shown to be\ncompetitive against state-of-the-art convex QP solvers in typical QPs arising\nfrom application domains such as portfolio optimization and model predictive\ncontrol. As such, QPALM strikes a unique balance between solving both easy and\nhard problems efficiently.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2020 12:01:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Sep 2021 03:25:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-06"}

Analyzing the mechanisms governing exchange of resources\nconstitutes the foundation of several social-science perspectives. Neoclassical\neconomics provides one of the most well-known perspectives of how rational\nindividuals allocate and exchange resources. Using Rational Choice Theory\n(RCT), neoclassical economics assumes that exchange between two individuals\nwill occur when resources are scarce and that these individuals interact\nrationally to satisfy their requirements (i.e., preferences). While RCT is\nuseful to characterize interaction in closed and stylized systems, it proves\ninsufficient to capture social and psychological reality where culture,\nemotions, and habits play an integral part in resource exchange. Social\nResource Theory (SRT) improves on RCT in several respects by making the social\nnature of resources the object of study. SRT shows how human interaction is\ndriven by an array of psychological mechanisms, from emotions to heuristics.\nThus, SRT provides a more realistic foundation for analyzing and explaining\nsocial exchange than the stylized instrumental rationality of RCT. Yet SRT has\nno clear place for events of abundance and sufficiency as additional\nmotivations to exchange resources.

This allowed us to identify the distinct physical mechanisms\ngoverning the particle transport. We then examined the asymptotic behavior of\nthe particle motion near the wall, revealing the fundamental differences to the\nnear wall behavior that is produced when incorporating gravitational settling.\nWhen the average vertical particle mass flux is zero, the averaged vertical\nparticle velocity is zero away from the wall due to the particles\npreferentially sampling regions where the fluid velocity is positive, which\nbalances with the downward Stokes settling velocity. When the average mass flux\nis negative, the combined effects of turbulence and particle inertia lead to\naverage vertical particle velocities that can significantly exceed the Stokes\nsettling velocity, by as much as ten times. Sufficiently far from the wall, the\nenhanced vertical velocities are due to the preferential sweeping mechanism.\nHowever, as the particles approach the wall, the contribution from the\npreferential sweeping mechanism becomes small, and a downward contribution from\nthe turbophoretic velocity dominates the behavior. Close to the wall, the\nparticle concentration grows as a power-law, but the nature of this power law\ndepends on the particle Stokes number.

An emerging group of smart stabilizers are\nmicrogels, which are nano- and micro-sized, three-dimensional polymer networks\nthat are swollen by a good solvent. In the last decades, the influence of\nvarious external stimuli on the two-dimensional phase behavior of microgels at\nair- and oil-water interfaces has been studied. However, the impact of the\ntop-phase itself has been barely considered. Here, we present data that\ndirectly address the influence of the top-phase on the microgel properties at\ninterfaces. The dimensions of pNIPAM microgels are measured after deposition\nfrom two interfaces, i.e., air- and decane-water. While the total in-plane size\nof the microgel increases with increasing interfacial tension, the portions or\nfractions of the microgels situated in the aqueous phase are not affected. We\ncorrelate the area microgels occupy to the surface tensions of the interfaces,\nwhich allows to estimate an elastic modulus. In comparison to nanoindentation\nmeasurements, we observe a larger elastic modulus for the microgels. By\ncombining compression, deposition, and visualization, we show that the\ntwo-dimensional phase behavior of the microgel monolayers is not altered,\nalthough the microgels have a larger total in-plane size at higher interfacial\ntension.

We identify X-ray and IR AGN among this kinematic\npair sample, a visually identified sample of mergers and interactions, and a\nmass-, redshift-, and environment-matched control sample for each in order to\ncalculate AGN fractions and the level of AGN enhancement as a function of\nrelative velocity, redshift, and X-ray luminosity. While we see a slight\nincrease in AGN fraction with decreasing projected separation, overall, we find\nno significant enhancement relative to the control sample at any separation. In\nthe closest projected separation bin ($<25$ kpc, $\\Delta V <1000$ km s$^{-1}$),\nwe find enhancements of a factor of 0.94$^{+0.21}_{-0.16}$ and\n1.00$^{+0.58}_{-0.31}$ for X-ray and IR-selected AGN, respectively. While we\nconclude that galaxy interactions do not significantly enhance AGN activity on\naverage over $0.5<z<3.0$ at these separations, given the errors and the small\nsample size at the closest projected separations, our results would be\nconsistent with the presence of low-level AGN enhancement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2020 13:32:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-02"}

The question of its formation route(s)\nis, therefore, of a major interest regarding astrochemical models. In this\npaper, we provide an extensive review of the gas-phase formation paths that\nwere, or are, reported in the literature and the major astrochemical databases.\nFour different gas-phase formation routes stand out : (1) CH$_3$OCH$_3$ + H$^+$\n/ CH$_3$CHOH$^+$ + e$^-$, (2) C$_2$H$_5$ + O($^3$P), (3) CH$_3$OH + CH and (4)\nCH$_3$CH$_2$OH + OH / CH$_3$CHOH + O($^3$P).

Thus, we carried out new accurate quantum chemistry\ncomputations. A theoretical kinetics study at low temperatures (7-300 K),\nadopting the RRKM scheme, was also performed. We confirm that reaction (2) is\nefficient in forming acetaldehyde in the 7-300 temperature range (alpha = 1.21\nx 10$^{-10}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$ and beta = 0.16). On the contrary, our new\ncomputations disprove the formation of acetaldehyde through reaction (3) (alpha\n= 1.84, 0.67 x 10$^{-13}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$ and beta = -0.07, -0.95).

In conclusions, of the four above paths only two, the (2) and (4),\nare potentially efficient gas-phase reaction routes for the formation of\nacetaldehyde and we encourage astrochemical modellers to only consider them.\nComparison with astronomical observations suggest that path (4) may actually\nplay the major role.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2020 13:43:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-14"}

Theory Related\nFields, '98] and [L. R. G. Fontes, M. Isopi, C. M. Newman, and K. Ravishankar,\nAnn. Probab., '04]). Among others, this characterisation enables us to\nestablish fine pathwise properties of BC and to relate these to special points\nof the Web. We prove that the Brownian Castle is a (strong) Markov and Feller\nprocess on a suitable space of c\\`adl\\`ag functions and determine its long-time\nbehaviour. At last, we give a glimpse to its universality by proving the\nconvergence of $0$-BD to BC in a rather strong sense.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2020 14:36:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 5 Feb 2021 13:00:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-08"}

The advent of multicore\narchitectures is noticeable in the HPC history, because it has brought the\nunderlying parallel programming concept into common considerations.

Indeed, the real\nconcern of HPC users is the time-to-output. Thus, we need to study each\nimportant aspect in the critical path between inputs and outputs. The first\nstep is clearly the method, which is a conjunction of modelling with specific\nconsiderations (hypothesis, simplifications, constraints, to name a few) and a\ncorresponding algorithm, which could be numerical and/or non numerical.

For instance, it is challenging to achieve diffraction-limited\nresolution in SPR imaging; its refractive index sensitivity is not as localized\nas desired.

However, the huge memory cost of deep CNN models poses\na great challenge of deploying them on memory-constrained devices (e.g., mobile\nphones). One popular way to reduce the memory cost of deep CNN model is to\ntrain binary CNN where the weights in convolution filters are either 1 or -1\nand therefore each weight can be efficiently stored using a single bit.\nHowever, the compression ratio of existing binary CNN models is upper bounded\nby around 32. To address this limitation, we propose a novel method to compress\ndeep CNN model by stacking low-dimensional binary convolution filters. Our\nproposed method approximates a standard convolution filter by selecting and\nstacking filters from a set of low-dimensional binary convolution filters. This\nset of low-dimensional binary convolution filters is shared across all filters\nfor a given convolution layer. Therefore, our method will achieve much larger\ncompression ratio than binary CNN models.

One way to deal with its computational hardness, is to trade the\nqualitative performance of an algorithm (allowing non-optimal outputs) for an\nimproved running time. For the vertex cover problem, there is a gap between\ntheory and practice when it comes to understanding this tradeoff. On the one\nhand, it is known that it is NP-hard to approximate a minimum vertex cover\nwithin a factor of $\\sqrt{2}$. On the other hand, a simple greedy algorithm\nyields close to optimal approximations in practice.\n  A promising approach towards understanding this discrepancy is to recognize\nthe differences between theoretical worst-case instances and real-world\nnetworks. Following this direction, we close the gap between theory and\npractice by providing an algorithm that efficiently computes nearly optimal\nvertex cover approximations on hyperbolic random graphs; a network model that\nclosely resembles real-world networks in terms of degree distribution,\nclustering, and the small-world property. More precisely, our algorithm\ncomputes a $(1 + o(1))$-approximation, asymptotically almost surely, and has a\nrunning time of $\\mathcal{O}(m \\log(n))$.\n  The proposed algorithm is an adaptation of the successful greedy approach,\nenhanced with a procedure that improves on parts of the graph where greedy is\nnot optimal. This makes it possible to introduce a parameter that can be used\nto tune the tradeoff between approximation performance and running time. Our\nempirical evaluation on real-world networks shows that this allows for\nimproving over the near-optimal results of the greedy approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2020 14:56:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Jun 2021 11:04:42 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 8 Dec 2021 14:56:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-09"}

In observations, the estimation of the two-point\ncorrelation function crucially relies on counting pairs in a random catalogue.\nThe latter contains a large number of randomly distributed points, which\naccounts for the survey window function. Random pair counts can also be\nadvantageously used for modelling the window function in the observed power\nspectrum. Since pair counting scales as $\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$, where $N$ is the\nnumber of points, the computational time to measure random pair counts can be\nvery expensive for large surveys. In this work, we present an alternative\napproach for estimating those counts that does not rely on the use of a random\ncatalogue. We derived an analytical expression for the anisotropic\nrandom-random pair counts that accounts for the galaxy radial distance\ndistribution, survey geometry, and possible galaxy weights.\n  Considering the cases of the VIPERS and SDSS-BOSS redshift surveys, we find\nthat the analytical calculation is in excellent agreement with the pair counts\nobtained from random catalogues. The main advantage of this approach is that\nthe primary calculation only takes a few minutes on a single CPU and it does\nnot depend on the number of random points. Furthermore, it allows for an\naccuracy on the monopole equivalent to what we would otherwise obtain when\nusing a random catalogue with about 1500 times more points than in the data at\nhand. We also describe and test an approximate expression for data-random pair\ncounts that is less accurate than for random-random counts, but still provides\nsubpercent accuracy on the monopole. The presented formalism should be very\nuseful in accounting for the window function in next-generation surveys, which\nwill necessitate accurate two-point window function estimates over huge\nobserved cosmological volumes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2020 15:04:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 5 Jan 2021 10:44:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-10"}

The radius of\nthe proxy is adaptively varied depending upon the local density of the point\ndata using kernel bandwidth estimation. During the interaction, the proxy moves\nin small steps tangentially over the point cloud such that the new position\nalways minimizes the distance between the proxy and the haptic interaction\npoint (HIP). The raw point cloud data re-sampled in a regular 3D lattice of\nvoxels are loaded to the haptic space after proper smoothing to avoid aliasing\neffects. The rendering technique is validated with several subjects, and it is\nobserved that this functionality supplements the user's experience by allowing\nthe user to interact with an object at multiple resolutions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2020 15:37:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 10 Oct 2020 07:39:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-13"}

The key idea to enable memory-efficient\nimage generation is to first generate a low-resolution version of the image\nfollowed by the generation of patches of constant sizes but successively\ngrowing resolutions. To avoid patch artifacts and incorporate global\ninformation, the patch generation is conditioned on patches from previous\nresolution scales. Those multi-scale GANs are trained to generate realistically\nlooking images from image sketches in order to perform an unpaired domain\ntranslation. This allows to preserve the topology of the test data and generate\nthe appearance of the training domain data. The evaluation of the domain\ntranslation scenarios is performed on brain MRIs of size 155x240x240 and thorax\nCTs of size up to 512x512x512.

In this\npaper, we show how to accomplish this idea in two steps. First, we propose\nreward machines, a type of finite state machine that supports the specification\nof reward functions while exposing reward function structure.

Experiments on tabular and continuous\ndomains, across different tasks and RL agents, show the benefits of exploiting\nreward structure with respect to sample efficiency and the quality of resultant\npolicies. Finally, by virtue of being a form of finite state machine, reward\nmachines have the expressive power of a regular language and as such support\nloops, sequences and conditionals, as well as the expression of temporally\nextended properties typical of linear temporal logic and non-Markovian reward\nspecification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2020 00:10:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 17 Jan 2022 18:12:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-19"}

As developers have continued to\nswiftly expand the scope of these kinds of technologies into an almost\nunbounded range of applications, an increasingly strident chorus of critical\nvoices has sounded concerns about the injurious effects of the proliferation of\nsuch systems. Opponents argue that the irresponsible design and use of facial\ndetection and recognition technologies (FDRTs) threatens to violate civil\nliberties, infringe on basic human rights and further entrench structural\nracism and systemic marginalisation. They also caution that the gradual creep\nof face surveillance infrastructures into every domain of lived experience may\neventually eradicate the modern democratic forms of life that have long\nprovided cherished means to individual flourishing, social solidarity and human\nself-creation. Defenders, by contrast, emphasise the gains in public safety,\nsecurity and efficiency that digitally streamlined capacities for facial\nidentification, identity verification and trait characterisation may bring. In\nthis explainer, I focus on one central aspect of this debate: the role that\ndynamics of bias and discrimination play in the development and deployment of\nFDRTs. I examine how historical patterns of discrimination have made inroads\ninto the design and implementation of FDRTs from their very earliest moments.\nAnd, I explain the ways in which the use of biased FDRTs can lead\ndistributional and recognitional injustices.

It is a subject of active research for a variety of purposes,\nincluding the interpretation of meaning, the investigation of the origin and\ndiffusion in time and space of representations, and the study of influences\nacross artists and art works. With the proliferation of digital archives of art\nimages, the possibility arises of applying Computer Vision techniques to the\nanalysis of art images at an unprecedented scale, which may support iconography\nresearch and education. In this paper we introduce a novel paintings data set\nfor iconography classification and present the quantitativeand qualitative\nresults of applying a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifier to the\nrecognition of the iconography of artworks. The proposed classifier achieves\ngood performances (71.17% Precision, 70.89% Recall, 70.25% F1-Score and 72.73%\nAverage Precision) in the task of identifying saints in Christian religious\npaintings, a task made difficult by the presence of classes with very similar\nvisual features. Qualitative analysis of the results shows that the CNN focuses\non the traditional iconic motifs that characterize the representation of each\nsaint and exploits such hints to attain correct identification. The ultimate\ngoal of our work is to enable the automatic extraction, decomposition, and\ncomparison of iconography elements to support iconographic studies and\nautomatic art work annotation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2020 12:40:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 10:32:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 26 Jul 2021 12:27:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-27"}

To build such a system,\nthree challenges need to be addressed. First, we need to create a visual\nquestion answering (VQA) dataset where the AI agent is presented with a\npathology image together with a question and is asked to give the correct\nanswer. Due to privacy concerns, pathology images are usually not publicly\navailable. Besides, only well-trained pathologists can understand pathology\nimages, but they barely have time to help create datasets for AI research. The\nsecond challenge is: since it is difficult to hire highly experienced\npathologists to create pathology visual questions and answers, the resulting\npathology VQA dataset may contain errors. Training pathology VQA models using\nthese noisy or even erroneous data will lead to problematic models that cannot\ngeneralize well on unseen images. The third challenge is: the medical concepts\nand knowledge covered in pathology question-answer (QA) pairs are very diverse\nwhile the number of QA pairs available for modeling training is limited. How to\nlearn effective representations of diverse medical concepts based on limited\ndata is technically demanding. In this paper, we aim to address these three\nchallenges. To our best knowledge, our work represents the first one addressing\nthe pathology VQA problem. To deal with the issue that a publicly available\npathology VQA dataset is lacking, we create PathVQA dataset. To address the\nsecond challenge, we propose a learning-by-ignoring approach. To address the\nthird challenge, we propose to use cross-modal self-supervised learning. We\nperform experiments on our created PathVQA dataset and the results demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our proposed learning-by-ignoring method and cross-modal\nself-supervised learning methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2020 00:36:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-26"}

Pre-main-sequence multiple\nsystems provide us with a unique laboratory to calibrate fundamental parameters\nsuch as the viscosity and to test theories of hydrodynamic processes that might\nshape protoplanetary disk structure and affect the planet populations forming\nfrom these disks.
