With the\nrapid developments of deep learning techniques, it is critical to take the\nsecurity concern into account for the application of the algorithms. While\nmachine learning offers significant advantages in terms of the application of\nalgorithms, the issue of security is ignored. Since it has many applications in\nthe real world, security is a vital part of the algorithms. In this paper, we\nhave proposed a mitigation method for adversarial attacks against machine\nlearning models with an autoencoder model that is one of the generative ones.\nThe main idea behind adversarial attacks against machine learning models is to\nproduce erroneous results by manipulating trained models. We have also\npresented the performance of autoencoder models to various attack methods from\ndeep neural networks to traditional algorithms by using different methods such\nas non-targeted and targeted attacks to multi-class logistic regression, a fast\ngradient sign method, a targeted fast gradient sign method and a basic\niterative method attack to neural networks for the MNIST dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Oct 2020 17:18:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-20"}

Previous works have shown\nthat GPT2, a large-scale language model, has achieved good performance on story\ngeneration.

In terms of consistency, on one hand, GPT2 cannot guarantee the\nconsistency of the plots explicitly. On the other hand, the generated stories\nusually contain coreference errors. In terms of coherency, GPT2 does not take\naccount of the discourse relations between sentences of stories directly. To\nenhance the consistency and coherency of the generated stories, we propose a\ntwo-stage generation framework, where the first stage is to organize the story\noutline which depicts the story plots and events, and the second stage is to\nexpand the outline into a complete story. Therefore the plots consistency can\nbe controlled and guaranteed explicitly. In addition, coreference supervision\nsignals are incorporated to reduce coreference errors and improve the\ncoreference consistency.

The metric is related to the three-point vertex function of a massive\nscalar interacting with a graviton to all orders in $G_N$, and the one-loop\ncontribution to this amplitude is computed from which the $G_N^2$ contribution\nto the metric is derived.\n  To understand the gauge-dependence of the metric, covariant gauge is used\nwhich introduces the parameter, $\\xi$, and the gauge-fixing function\n$G_\\sigma$.

The lazy search tree is a\ncomparison-based data structure on the pointer machine that supports\norder-based operations such as rank, select, membership, predecessor,\nsuccessor, minimum, and maximum while providing dynamic operations insert,\ndelete, change-key, split, and merge. We analyze the performance of our data\nstructure based on a partition of current elements into a set of gaps\n$\\{\\Delta_i\\}$ based on rank. A query falls into a particular gap and splits\nthe gap into two new gaps at a rank $r$ associated with the query operation. If\nwe define $B = \\sum_i |\\Delta_i| \\log_2(n/|\\Delta_i|)$, our performance over a\nsequence of $n$ insertions and $q$ distinct queries is $O(B + \\min(n \\log \\log\nn, n \\log q))$.

The same data structure\nsupports queries for any rank, interpolating between binary search trees and\nefficient priority queues.\n  Lazy search trees can be implemented to operate mostly on arrays, requiring\nonly $O(\\min(q, n))$ pointers. Via direct reduction, our data structure also\nsupports the efficient access theorems of the splay tree, providing a powerful\ndata structure for non-uniform element access, both when the number of accesses\nis small and large.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Oct 2020 18:24:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-20"}

Knowledge and experiences gained from\ntreating one entity are applied to treat a related but distinctively different\none. This notion of \"transition to the similar\" renders individualized\ntreatments an operational meaning, yet its theoretical foundation defies the\nfamiliar inductive inference framework. The uniqueness of entities is the\nresult of potentially an infinite number of attributes (hence $p=\\infty$),\nwhich entails zero direct training sample size (i.e., $n=0$) because genuine\nguinea pigs do not exist. However, the literature on wavelets and on sieve\nmethods suggests a principled approximation theory for transitional inference\nvia a multi-resolution (MR) perspective, where we use the resolution level to\nindex the degree of approximation to ultimate individuality. MR inference seeks\na primary resolution indexing an indirect training sample, which provides\nenough matched attributes to increase the relevance of the results to the\ntarget individuals and yet still accumulate sufficient indirect sample sizes\nfor robust estimation. Theoretically, MR inference relies on an infinite-term\nANOVA-type decomposition, providing an alternative way to model sparsity via\nthe decay rate of the resolution bias as a function of the primary resolution\nlevel. Unexpectedly, this decomposition reveals a world without variance when\nthe outcome is a deterministic function of potentially infinitely many\npredictors. In this deterministic world, the optimal resolution prefers\nover-fitting in the traditional sense when the resolution bias decays\nsufficiently rapidly.

Generalized Lasso (GL) programs are effective\nfor solving GCS problems due to their proven ability to leverage underlying\nsignal structure. Three popular GL programs are equivalent in a sense and\nsometimes used interchangeably. Tuned by a governing parameter, each admit an\noptimal parameter choice. For sparse or low-rank signal structures, this choice\nyields minimax order-optimal error. While GCS is well-studied, existing theory\nfor GL programs typically concerns this optimally tuned setting. However, the\noptimal parameter value for a GL program depends on properties of the data, and\nis typically unknown in practical settings. Performance in empirical problems\nthus hinges on a program's parameter sensitivity: it is desirable that small\nvariation about the optimal parameter choice begets small variation about the\noptimal risk. We examine the risk for these three programs and demonstrate that\ntheir parameter sensitivity can differ for the same data. We prove a\ngauge-constrained GL program admits asymptotic cusp-like behaviour of its risk\nin the limiting low-noise regime. We prove that a residual-constrained Lasso\nprogram has asymptotically suboptimal risk for very sparse vectors.

We support the asymptotic\ntheory with numerical simulations, demonstrating that parameter sensitivity of\nGL programs is readily observed for even modest dimensional parameters.\nImportantly, these simulations demonstrate regimes in which a GL program\nexhibits sensitivity to its parameter choice, though the other two do not.

By capturing the\nappearance of the human subject under different light sources, one obtains the\nlight transport matrix of that subject, which enables image-based relighting in\nnovel environments. However, due to the finite number of lights in the stage,\nthe light transport matrix only represents a sparse sampling on the entire\nsphere. As a consequence, relighting the subject with a point light or a\ndirectional source that does not coincide exactly with one of the lights in the\nstage requires interpolation and resampling the images corresponding to nearby\nlights, and this leads to ghosting shadows, aliased specularities, and other\nartifacts. To ameliorate these artifacts and produce better results under\narbitrary high-frequency lighting, this paper proposes a learning-based\nsolution for the \"super-resolution\" of scans of human faces taken from a light\nstage. Given an arbitrary \"query\" light direction, our method aggregates the\ncaptured images corresponding to neighboring lights in the stage, and uses a\nneural network to synthesize a rendering of the face that appears to be\nilluminated by a \"virtual\" light source at the query location. This neural\nnetwork must circumvent the inherent aliasing and regularity of the light stage\ndata that was used for training, which we accomplish through the use of\nregularized traditional interpolation methods within our network. Our learned\nmodel is able to produce renderings for arbitrary light directions that exhibit\nrealistic shadows and specular highlights, and is able to generalize across a\nwide variety of subjects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 17 Oct 2020 23:40:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-20"}

The methodology involves the degree of\nmultiscaling at a particular time instance, the multiscaling trend which is\ncalculated by the Change-Point Analysis method, and a rigorous evaluation of\nthe statistical significance of the results. Using this algorithm, we have\nidentified particular patterns in the temporal co-evolution of the different\n$H_q$ time-series.

Experiments on the 360D dataset\nshow that the proposed method can effectively extract semantic features from\ndistorted panoramas and alleviate the supervision bias caused by distortion. It\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on the 360D dataset with high efficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Oct 2020 08:47:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2020 01:41:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-24"}

It is of great importance to understand the underlying\nmechanisms of the occurrence of such differences. By incorporating pair pattern\nstrategies and reference point strategies into an agent-based model, we have\ninvestigated the coupled effects of heterogeneous investment strategies and\nheterogeneous risk tolerance on price fluctuations. In the market flooded with\nthe investors with homogeneous investment strategies or homogeneous risk\ntolerance, large price fluctuations are easy to occur. In the market flooded\nwith the investors with heterogeneous investment strategies or heterogeneous\nrisk tolerance, the price fluctuations are suppressed. For a heterogeneous\npopulation, the coexistence of investors with pair pattern strategies and\nreference point strategies causes the price to have a slow fluctuation around a\ntypical equilibrium point and both a large price fluctuation and a no-trading\nstate are avoided, in which the pair pattern strategies push the system far\naway from the equilibrium while the reference point strategies pull the system\nback to the equilibrium. A theoretical analysis indicates that the evolutionary\ndynamics in the present model is governed by the competition between different\nstrategies. The strategy that causes large price fluctuations loses more while\nthe strategy that pulls the system back to the equilibrium gains more.\nOverfrequent trading does harm to one's pursuit for more wealth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Oct 2020 11:28:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-20"}

In DAA massive MIMO,\nthe base station (BS) consists of multiple antenna sub-arrays. Notably, the\nantenna sub-arrays are deployed in arbitrary locations within a DAA massive\nMIMO cell. Consequently, the distance-dependent large-scale propagation\ncoefficients are different from a user to these different antenna sub-arrays,\nwhich makes power control a challenging problem. We assume that the network\noperates in time-division duplex mode, where each BS obtains the channel\nestimates via uplink pilots.

As gravity is extreme,\nrotation is extreme: neutron stars are the fastest rotating stars known, with\nperiods as short as a millisecond. The presence of a magnetic field not aligned\nwith the rotation axis of the star is the origin of pulsating emission from\nthese sources, which for this reason are dubbed pulsars. The discovery in 1998\nof the first Accreting Millisecond X-ray Pulsar, started an exciting season of\ncontinuing discoveries.

The major problem is the\ncommunication bottleneck found in many subgraph-centric frameworks. Detailed\nanalysis indicates that the communication bottleneck is caused by the huge\ncommunication volume or the extreme message imbalance among partitioned\nsubgraphs. The traditional partition algorithms do not consider both factors at\nthe same time, especially on power-law graphs.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel efficient and balanced vertex-cut graph\npartition algorithm (EBV) which grants appropriate weights to the overall\ncommunication cost and communication balance. We observe that the number of\nreplicated vertices and the balance of edge and vertex assignment have a great\ninfluence on communication patterns of distributed subgraph-centric frameworks,\nwhich further affect the overall performance. Based on this insight, We design\nan evaluation function that quantifies the proportion of replicated vertices\nand the balance of edges and vertices assignments as important parameters.\nBesides, we sort the order of edge processing by the sum of end-vertices'\ndegrees from small to large. Experiments show that EBV reduces replication\nfactor and communication by at least 21.8% and 23.7% respectively than other\nself-based partition algorithms. When deployed in the subgraph-centric\nframework, it reduces the running time on power-law graphs by an average of\n16.8% compared with the state-of-the-art partition algorithm.

However, there are many\nchallenges in the implementation of EC. Firstly, user's privacy has been raised\nas a major concern because the edge devices may be untrustworthy. In the case\nof Private Edge Computing (PEC), a user wants to compute a matrix\nmultiplication between its local matrix and one of the matrices in a library,\nwhich has been redundantly stored in edge devices. When utilizing resources of\nedge devices, the privacy requires that each edge device cannot know which\nmatrix stored on it is desired by the user for the multiplication. Secondly,\nedge devices usually have limited communication and storage resources, which\nmakes it impossible for them to store all matrices in the library. In this\npaper, we consider the limited resources of edge devices and propose an unified\nframework for PEC. Within the framework, we study two highly-coupled problems,\n(1) storage allocation, that determines which matrices are stored on each edge\ndevice, and (2) computation design, that determines which matrices (or linear\ncombinations of them) in each edge device are selected to participate in the\ncomputing process with the privacy consideration. Specifically, we give a\ngeneral storage allocation scheme and then design two feasible private\ncomputation schemes, i.e., General Private Computation (GPC) scheme and Private\nCoded Computation (PCC) scheme. In particular, GPC can be applied in general\ncase and PCC can only be applied in special cases, while PCC achieves less\ncommunication load. We theoretically analyze the proposed computing schemes and\ncompare them with other schemes. Finally, we conduct extensive simulations to\nshow the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Oct 2020 15:55:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-20"}

Our study is performed within the\nmicroscopic-macroscopic method with the deformed Woods-Saxon single-particle\npotential and the Yukawa-plus-exponential macroscopic energy taken as the\nsmooth part. We use parameters of the model that were fitted previously to\nmasses of even-even heavy nuclei. For systems with odd numbers of protons,\nneutrons, or both, we use a standard BCS method with blocking. Ground-state\nshapes and energies are found by the minimization over seven axially-symmetric\ndeformations. A search for saddle-points was performed by using the \"imaginary\nwater flow\" method in three consecutive stages, using five- (for nonaxial\nshapes) and seven-dimensional (for reflection-asymmetric shapes) deformation\nspaces. The results are collected in two main tables.

Modeling video necessitates\nbuilding not only spatio-temporal models for the dynamic visual channel but\nalso multimodal structures for associated information channels such as\nsubtitles or audio. Video QA adds at least two more layers of complexity -\nselecting relevant content for each channel in the context of the linguistic\nquery, and composing spatio-temporal concepts and relations in response to the\nquery. To address these requirements, we start with two insights: (a) content\nselection and relation construction can be jointly encapsulated into a\nconditional computational structure, and (b) video-length structures can be\ncomposed hierarchically. For (a) this paper introduces a general-reusable\nneural unit dubbed Conditional Relation Network (CRN) taking as input a set of\ntensorial objects and translating into a new set of objects that encode\nrelations of the inputs. The generic design of CRN helps ease the common\ncomplex model building process of Video QA by simple block stacking with\nflexibility in accommodating input modalities and conditioning features across\nboth different domains. As a result, we realize insight (b) by introducing\nHierarchical Conditional Relation Networks (HCRN) for Video QA. The HCRN\nprimarily aims at exploiting intrinsic properties of the visual content of a\nvideo and its accompanying channels in terms of compositionality, hierarchy,\nand near and far-term relation. HCRN is then applied for Video QA in two forms,\nshort-form where answers are reasoned solely from the visual content, and\nlong-form where associated information, such as subtitles, presented. Our\nrigorous evaluations show consistent improvements over SOTAs on well-studied\nbenchmarks including large-scale real-world datasets such as TGIF-QA and TVQA,\ndemonstrating the strong capabilities of our CRN unit and the HCRN for complex\ndomains such as Video QA.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Oct 2020 02:31:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 3 Jan 2021 07:11:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-05"}
