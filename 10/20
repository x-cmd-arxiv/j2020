For the\nsingle-facility problem under the maximum-cost objective, we give a\ndeterministic 3-approximation group strategy-proof mechanism, and prove that no\ndeterministic (or randomized) strategy-proof mechanism can have an\napproximation ratio better than 3 (or 2). For the two-facility problem on a\nline, we give an anonymous deterministic group strategy-proof mechanism that is\n(2n-3)-approximation for the total-cost objective, and 3-approximation for the\nmaximum-cost objective. We also provide (asymptotically) tight lower bounds on\nthe approximation ratio.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 16:33:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2020 08:53:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-02"}

The key idea underlying our technique is\nto over-approximate the program's feasible API call sequences using a\ncontext-free grammar (CFG) and then check language inclusion between this\ngrammar and the specification. However, since this inclusion check may fail due\nto imprecision in the program's CFG abstraction, we propose a novel refinement\ntechnique to progressively improve the CFG. In particular, our method obtains\ncounterexamples from CFG inclusion queries and uses them to introduce new\nnon-terminals and productions to the grammar while still over-approximating the\nprogram's relevant behavior.\n  We have implemented the proposed algorithm in a tool called CFPChecker and\nevaluate it on 10 popular Java applications that use at least one API with a\ncontext-free specification. Our evaluation shows that CFPChecker is able to\nverify correct usage of the API in clients that use it correctly and produces\ncounterexamples for those that do not.

The structural connectivity matrix of\nsynaptic weights between neurons is a critical determinant of overall network\nfunction, but quantitative links between neural network structure and function\nare complex and subtle. For example, many networks can give rise to similar\nfunctional responses, and the same network can function differently depending\non context. Whether certain patterns of synaptic connectivity are required to\ngenerate specific network-level computations is largely unknown. Here we\nintroduce a geometric framework for identifying synaptic connections required\nby steady-state responses in recurrent networks of threshold-linear neurons.\nAssuming that the number of specified response patterns does not exceed the\nnumber of input synapses, we analytically calculate the solution space of all\nfeedforward and recurrent connectivity matrices that can generate the specified\nresponses from the network inputs.

We propose a novel\nconvolutional network based on Mask-RCNN that can jointly learn to localize\nhands and predict their physical contact to address this problem. The network\nuses outputs from another object detector to obtain locations of objects\npresent in the scene.

The first attention\nmechanism is based on the hand and a region's affinity, enclosing the hand and\nthe object, and densely pools features from this region to the hand region. The\nsecond attention module adaptively selects salient features from this plausible\nregion of contact.

While qubit codes require\nmany physical systems to be controlled, oscillator codes offer the possibility\nto perform error correction on a single physical entity. One powerful encoding\nfor oscillators is the grid state or GKP encoding, which allows small\ndisplacement errors to be corrected. Here we introduce and implement a\ndissipative map designed for physically realistic finite GKP codes which\nperforms quantum error correction of a logical qubit implemented in the motion\nof a single trapped ion. The correction cycle involves two rounds, which\ncorrect small displacements in position and momentum respectively. Each\nconsists of first mapping the finite GKP code stabilizer information onto an\ninternal electronic state ancilla qubit, and then applying coherent feedback\nand ancilla repumping. We demonstrate the extension of logical coherence using\nboth square and hexagonal GKP codes, achieving an increase in logical lifetime\nof a factor of three. The simple dissipative map used for the correction can be\nviewed as a type of reservoir engineering, which pumps into the highly\nnon-classical GKP qubit manifold.

The MRoD algorithm involves estimating a manifold component,\napproximating common features among all patients, and the difference component\nwhich has the freedom to fit the measured data. By applying a\nsparsity-promoting penalty to the difference image rather than a hard\nconstraint to the manifold, the MRoD algorithm is able to reconstruct features\nwhich are not present in the training data.

The\nresults show that the approach contributed to aligning business criteria\nbetween the business and technical stakeholders. We also observed a downward\ntrend in the amount of technical debt that affects high-value business assets.\nMoreover, we identified eight business factors that affect the decision making\nrelated to the prioritization of technical debt. The study results suggest that\nthe proposed business-driven technical debt prioritization approach can help\nteams to focus their efforts on paying off the business' most relevant debt.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 17:59:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Mar 2021 03:49:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-13"}

Using a suite of self-consistent cosmological and zoom-in\nsimulations based on the Auriga galaxy-formation model, we determine that all\nmechanisms produce galactic magnetic fields that equally affect galaxy\nformation, and are nearly indistinguishable at $z\\lesssim1.5$. The former is\ncompatible with observed values, while the latter is correlated with the gas\nmetallicity below a seed-dependent redshift. Low-density gas and haloes below a\nseed-dependent mass threshold retain memory of the initial magnetic field. We\nproduce synthetic Faraday rotation measure maps, showing that they have the\npotential to constrain the seeding process, although current observations are\nnot yet sensitive enough. Our results imply that the ad-hoc assumption of a\nprimordial seed field - widely used in galaxy formation simulations but of\nuncertain physical origin - can be replaced by physically-motivated mechanisms\nfor magnetogenesis with negligible impact on galactic properties. Additionally,\nmagnetic fields generated ahead of ionization fronts appear very similar but\nweaker than those produced by the Biermann battery. Hence, in a realistic\nscenario where both mechanisms are active, the former will be negligible\ncompared to the latter.

Many variants of this approach\nhave been proposed in the literature, such as counterfactual generation and\noptimizing over a Gumbel-Softmax distribution.

Though this\npresents a biologically plausible alternative to backpropagation in training a\nnetwork, the high variance associated with it renders it impractical to train\ndeep networks. The high variance arises from the inefficient structural credit\nassignment since a single reward signal is used to evaluate the collective\naction of all units. To facilitate structural credit assignment, we propose\nreplacing the reward signal to hidden units with the change in the $L^2$ norm\nof the unit's outgoing weight. As such, each hidden unit in the network is\ntrying to maximize the norm of its outgoing weight instead of the global\nreward, and thus we call this learning method Weight Maximization. We prove\nthat Weight Maximization is approximately following the gradient of rewards in\nexpectation. In contrast to backpropagation, Weight Maximization can be used to\ntrain both continuous-valued and discrete-valued units. Moreover, Weight\nMaximization solves several major issues of backpropagation relating to\nbiological plausibility. Our experiments show that a network trained with\nWeight Maximization can learn significantly faster than REINFORCE and slightly\nslower than backpropagation.

Previous results on random circuits have only shown that\n$O(N^{1/D})$ depth suffices or that $O(\\log^3 N)$ depth suffices for all-to-all\nconnectivity ($D \\to \\infty$). We then study the critical behavior of the\nerasure threshold in the so-called moderate deviation limit, where both the\nfailure probability and the distance to the optimal threshold converge to zero\nwith $N$. We find that the requisite depth scales like $O(\\log N)$ only for\ndimensions $D \\ge 2$, and that random circuits require $O(\\sqrt{N})$ depth for\n$D=1$. Finally, we introduce an \"expurgation\" algorithm that uses quantum\nmeasurements to remove logical operators that cause the code to fail by turning\nthem into additional stabilizers or gauge operators. With such targeted\nmeasurements, we can achieve sub-logarithmic depth in $D\\ge 2$ below capacity\nwithout increasing the maximum weight of the check operators. We find that for\nany rate beneath the capacity, high-performing codes with thousands of logical\nqubits are achievable with depth 4-8 expurgated random circuits in $D=2$\ndimensions. These results indicate that finite-rate quantum codes are\npractically relevant for near-term devices and may significantly reduce the\nresource requirements to achieve fault tolerance for near-term applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 18:25:30 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Jul 2021 22:28:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-29"}

Despite more than a decade of research and development, the problem\nof how to competently interact with diverse road users in diverse scenarios\nremains largely unsolved.

The problem of result list truncation, or where to truncate the\nranked list of results, however, has received less attention despite being\ncrucial in a variety of applications. Such truncation is a balancing act\nbetween the overall relevance, or usefulness of the results, with the user cost\nof processing more results. Result list truncation can be challenging because\nrelevance scores are often not well-calibrated. This is particularly true in\nlarge-scale IR systems where documents and queries are embedded in the same\nmetric space and a query's nearest document neighbors are returned during\ninference. Here, relevance is inversely proportional to the distance between\nthe query and candidate document, but what distance constitutes relevance\nvaries from query to query and changes dynamically as more documents are added\nto the index. In this work, we propose Surprise scoring, a statistical method\nthat leverages the Generalized Pareto distribution that arises in extreme value\ntheory to produce interpretable and calibrated relevance scores at query time\nusing nothing more than the ranked scores.

One challenge of performing pooling operations on\ngraph data is the lack of locality that is not well-defined on graphs. Previous\nstudies used global ranking methods to sample some of the important nodes, but\nmost of them are not able to incorporate graph topology. In this work, we\npropose the topology-aware pooling (TAP) layer that explicitly considers graph\ntopology. Our TAP layer is a two-stage voting process that selects more\nimportant nodes in a graph. It first performs local voting to generate scores\nfor each node by attending each node to its neighboring nodes. The scores are\ngenerated locally such that topology information is explicitly considered. In\naddition, graph topology is incorporated in global voting to compute the\nimportance score of each node globally in the entire graph. Altogether, the\nfinal ranking score for each node is computed by combining its local and global\nvoting scores. To encourage better graph connectivity in the sampled graph, we\npropose to add a graph connectivity term to the computation of ranking scores.\nResults on graph classification tasks demonstrate that our methods achieve\nconsistently better performance than previous methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 20:14:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-21"}

Recently, alternative methods that use visible light communication\n(VLC) signals from vehicle head/tail LED lights for positioning (VLP) have\nshown significant promise, attaining cm-level accuracy and near-kHz rate in\nrealistic driving scenarios. These methods estimate position in two steps: 1)\nRelative transmitter bearings (angle) or ranges (distance) are measured based\non received VLC signals, and 2) these measurements are combined to estimate\nrelative positions of transmitters (i.e., head/tail lights). In this survey\npaper, we first review existing bearing/range measurement techniques and\npositioning algorithms for vehicular VLP.

Similarly,\ndata augmentation techniques, which encode prior information in the form of\ninvariant feature transformations, are effective for improving calibration and\nrobustness. In this paper, we show a surprising pathology: combining ensembles\nand data augmentation can harm model calibration. This leads to a trade-off in\npractice, whereby improved accuracy by combining the two techniques comes at\nthe expense of calibration. On the other hand, selecting only one of the\ntechniques ensures good uncertainty estimates at the expense of accuracy. We\ninvestigate this pathology and identify a compounding under-confidence among\nmethods which marginalize over sets of weights and data augmentation techniques\nwhich soften labels.

Instead of using channel and video data as features for\nclassification as other researchers have, these methods use a self-supervised\nlearning approach that leverages the public subscription pages of commenters.\nWe test the classification method on the task of predicting the political lean\nof YouTube news channels and find that it outperforms the previous best model\non the task. Further experiments also show that there are important advantages\nto using commenter subscriptions to discover channels.

We propose a self-supervised approach (LT-GAN) to improve the\ngeneration quality and diversity of images by estimating the GAN-induced\ntransformation (i.e. transformation induced in the generated images by\nperturbing the latent space of generator). Specifically, given two pairs of\nimages where each pair comprises of a generated image and its transformed\nversion, the self-supervision task aims to identify whether the latent\ntransformation applied in the given pair is same to that of the other pair.\nHence, this auxiliary loss encourages the generator to produce images that are\ndistinguishable by the auxiliary network, which in turn promotes the synthesis\nof semantically consistent images with respect to latent transformations.

This paper describes the results of a systematic\nmapping study on the use of SE for scientific application development and their\nimpact on software quality. Method: To achieve this goal we have performed a\nsystematic mapping study on 359 papers. We first describe a catalogue of SE\npractices used in scientific software development. Then, we discuss the quality\nattributes of interest that drive the application of these practices, as well\nas tentative side-effects of applying the practices on qualities.

From cohesive energy\ncalculations, we find that the C(N) and B(C) substitutions are the most\nenergetically favorable and induce small bond modifications in the vicinity of\nthe impurity, while the S(N) induces strong lattice distortions. Though all of\nthe studied impurities induce defect levels inside the band gap of these\nmaterials, their electronic properties are poles apart depending on the\nbehavior of the impurity as an acceptor or a donor.

Consequently, acceptor\nwavefunctions are directed towards the pores and donor wavefunctions are more\nextended throughout the neighboring atoms, a property that could further be\nexplored to modify the interaction between these materials and adsorbates.\nMoreover, impurity properties display a strong site sensitivity and ground\nstate binding energies ranging from $0.03$ to $1.13$ eV, thus offering an\ninteresting route for tuning the optical properties of these materials.\nFinally, spin-polarized calculations reveal that all impurity configurations\nhave a magnetic ground state that rises from the spin splitting of the impurity\nlevels.

What are the neural mechanisms underlying our capacity to\ntrack moving objects when there is no physical stimulus for the brain to track?\nOne possibility is that the brain 'fills-in' information about imagined objects\nusing internally generated representations similar to those generated by\nfeed-forward perceptual mechanisms. Alternatively, the brain might deploy a\nhigher order mechanism, for example using an object tracking model that\nintegrates visual signals and motion dynamics. In the present study, we used\nEEG and time-resolved multivariate pattern analyses to investigate the spatial\nprocessing of visible and imagined objects. Participants tracked an object that\nmoved in discrete steps around fixation, occupying six consecutive locations.\nThey were asked to imagine that the object continued on the same trajectory\nafter it disappeared and move their attention to the corresponding positions.\nTime-resolved decoding of EEG data revealed that the location of the visible\nstimuli could be decoded shortly after image onset, consistent with early\nretinotopic visual processes. For processing of unseen/imagined positions, the\npatterns of neural activity resembled stimulus-driven mid-level visual\nprocesses, but were detected earlier than perceptual mechanisms, implicating an\nanticipatory and more variable tracking mechanism. Encoding models revealed\nthat spatial representations were much weaker for imagined than visible\nstimuli. Monitoring the position of imagined objects thus utilises similar\nperceptual and attentional processes as monitoring objects that are actually\npresent, but with different temporal dynamics.

Using fMRI, the functional\nconnectivity (FC) between brain regions can be inferred, which has contributed\nto a number of findings of the fundamental properties of the brain. As an\nimportant clinical application of FC, clustering of subjects based on FC\nrecently draws much attention, which can potentially reveal important\nheterogeneity in subjects such as subtypes of psychiatric disorders. In\nparticular, a multiple-view clustering method is a powerful analytical tool,\nwhich identifies clustering patterns of subjects depending on their FC in\nspecific brain areas.

Einstein equations in this case reduce\nto an integrable system. In 1971, Geroch has shown that this system admits an\ninfinite-dimensional group of symmetry transformations known as the Geroch\ngroup. The phase space of this system can be parametrized by a matrix-valued\nfunction of spectral parameter, called monodromy matrix. The latter admits the\nRiemann-Hilbert factorization into a pair of transition matrices, i.e.\nmatrix-valued functions of spectral parameter such that one of them is\nholomorphic in the upper half-plane, and the other is holomorphic in the lower\nhalf-plane.

For many students, however, gaining a good\nunderstanding of algorithms remains a challenge.\n  Because of the automated nature of sequential algorithms. there is an\ninherent tension in directly applying the `learning by doing' approach. This\npartly explains the limitations of efforts like algorithm animation and code\ntracing.\n  Algodynamics, the approach we propose and advocate, situates algorithms\nwithin the framework of transition systems and their dynamics and offers an\nattractive approach for teaching algorithms. Algodynamics starts with the\npremise that the key ideas underlying an algorithm can be identified and\npackaged into interactive transition systems. The algorithm when `opened up',\nreveals a transition system, shorn of most control aspects, enriched instead\nwith interaction. The design of an algorithm can be carried out by constructing\na series of interactive systems, progressively trading interactivity with\nautomation. These transition systems constitute a family of notional machines.\n  We illustrate the algodynamics approach by considering Bubblesort. A sequence\nof five interactive transition systems culminate in the classic Bubblesort\nalgorithm. The exercise of constructing the individual systems also pays off\nwhen coding Bubblesort: a highly modular implementation whose primitives are\nborrowed from the transition systems. The transition systems used for\nBubblesort have been implemented as interactive experiments. These web based\nimplementations are easy to build. The simplicity and flexibility afforded by\nthe algodynamics framework makes it an attractive option to teach algorithms in\nan interactive way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 04:38:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-21"}

Even if the\ninstrument Z satisfies the three core IV assumptions of relevance, independence\nand the exclusion restriction, further assumptions are required to identify the\naverage causal effect (ACE) of X on Y. Sufficient assumptions for this include:\nhomogeneity in the causal effect of X on Y; homogeneity in the association of Z\nwith X; and no effect modification (NEM). Methods: We describe the NO\nSimultaneous Heterogeneity (NOSH) assumption, which requires the heterogeneity\nin the X-Y causal effect to be mean independent of (i.e., uncorrelated with)\nboth Z and heterogeneity in the Z-X association. This happens, for example, if\nthere are no common modifiers of the X-Y effect and the Z-X association, and\nthe X-Y effect is additive linear. We illustrate NOSH using simulations and by\nre-examining selected published studies. Results: When NOSH holds, the Wald\nestimand equals the ACE even if both homogeneity assumptions and NEM (which we\ndemonstrate to be special cases of - and therefore stronger than - NOSH) are\nviolated.

The PS then updates\nthe global model according to the signal received over the wireless MAC, and\nshares it with the devices.

With the advances of deep\nlearning, current link prediction methods commonly compute features from\nsubgraphs centered at two neighboring nodes and use the features to predict the\nlabel of the link between these two nodes. In this formalism, a link prediction\nproblem is converted to a graph classification task.

For\nexample, in the study of gene interaction and regulation in Drosophila\nembryogenesis, the analysis is most biologically meaningful when in situ\nhybridization (ISH) gene expression pattern images from the same developmental\nstage are compared. However, labeling training data with precise stages is very\ntime-consuming even for evelopmental biologists. Thus, a critical challenge is\nhow to build accurate computational models for precise developmental stage\nclassification from limited training samples. In addition, identification and\nvisualization of developmental landmarks are required to enable biologists to\ninterpret prediction results and calibrate models. To address these challenges,\nwe propose a deep two-step low-shot learning framework to accurately classify\nISH images using limited training images. Specifically, to enable accurate\nmodel training on limited training samples, we formulate the task as a deep\nlow-shot learning problem and develop a novel two-step learning approach,\nincluding data-level learning and feature-level learning.

In an extensive\nevaluation, we compare our method against $6$ other methods on $8$ different\ndatasets with and without concept drift. We show that our algorithm outperforms\ncurrent state-of-the-art algorithms and, at the same time, uses fewer\nresources. Last, we highlight a real-world use-case of our algorithm for data\nsummarization in gamma-ray astronomy.

The solid phase is modeled with an incompressible viscous\nhyperelastic constitutive relation, and the flow is characterized by three main\ndimensionless parameters, namely the solid volume fraction, the Reynolds and\ncapillary numbers. The dependency of the effective viscosity on these three\nquantities is investigated to study the inertial effects on a suspension of\ndeformable particles. It can be observed that the suspension has a\nshear-thinning behavior, and the reduction in effective viscosity for high\nshear rates is emphasized in denser configurations. The separate analysis of\nthe Reynolds and capillary numbers reveal that the effective viscosity depends\nmore on the capillary than on the Reynolds number.

We address\nthis challenge by using existing IE/NLP tools to automatically generate a large\nquantity (89,000) of system-produced document-graph pairs, and propose a novel\nformulation of the contextualized graph generation problem as a\nsequence-to-sequence mapping task. These strategies enable us to leverage and\nfine-tune pre-trained language models on the system-induced training data for\nthe graph generation task. Our experiments show that our approach is highly\neffective in generating structurally and semantically valid graphs. Further,\nevaluation on a challenging hand-labeled, out-domain corpus shows that our\nmethod outperforms the closest existing method by a large margin on several\nmetrics.

While the private feature is typically\ndetermined and known by the users who release their data, the specific task in\nwhich the released data is utilized is usually unknown. To address the lack of\ninformation of the specific task, utility constraints laid on a set of possible\ntasks are considered. The mechanism protects the privacy while satisfying\nutility of all possible tasks in the set. First, the single-letter\ncharacterization of the rate-leakage-distortion region is derived.\nCharacterization of the minimum leakage under log-loss distortion and\nunconstrained released rate turns out to be a non-convex problem. Second,\nfocusing on the case where the raw data consists of independent components, we\nshow that the above problem can be decomposed into multiple parallel privacy\nfunnel (PF) problems with different weightings.

The solution is characterized by a leakage-free\nthreshold, and the minimum leakage is zero while the utility constraint is\nbelow the threshold.

Social news aggregators are one of the actors\nin this area in which users post news items and use positive or negative votes\nto indicate their preference toward a news item. News items will be ordered and\ndisplayed according to their aggregated votes. This approach suffers from\nseveral problems raging from being prone to the dominance of the majority to\ndifficulty in discerning between correct and fake news, and lack of incentive\nfor honest behaviors. In this paper, we propose a graph-based news aggregator\nin which instead of voting on the news items, users submit their votes on the\nrelations between pairs of news items. More precisely, if a user believes two\nnews items support each other, he will submit a positive vote on the link\nbetween the two items, and if he believes that two news items undermine each\nother, he will submit a negative vote on the corresponding link. This approach\nhas mainly two desirable features: (1) mitigating the effect of personal\npreferences on voting, (2) connection of new items to endorsing and disputing\nevidence. This approach helps the newsreaders to understand different aspects\nof a news item better. We also introduce an incentive layer that uses\nblockchain as a distributed transparent manager to encourages users to behave\nhonestly and abstain from adversary behaviors. The incentive layer takes into\naccount that users can have different viewpoints toward news, enabling users\nfrom a wide range of viewpoints to contribute to the network and benefit from\nits rewards. In addition, we introduce a protocol that enables us to prove\nfraud in computations of the incentive layer model on the blockchain.\nUltimately, we will analyze the fraud proof protocol and examine our incentive\nlayer on a wide range of synthesized datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 07:21:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-21"}

This is a consequence of the physical origins of\nthe force production for pitch-dominated ($h^* < 0.5$) and heave-dominated\n($h^* > 0.5$) motions. Based on insight derived from classic unsteady thin\nairfoil theory, it is discovered that pitch-dominated motions are driven by\nadded-mass-based thrust production where self-propelled efficiency is maximized\nfor high reduced frequencies, while heave-dominated motions are driven by\ncirculatory-based thrust production where self-propelled efficiency is\nmaximized by low reduced frequencies. Regardless of the dimensionless heave\nratio the reduced frequency is high for small amplitude motions, high Lighthill\nnumbers, and low duty cycles and vice versa.

Specifically, our approach not only exploits both spatial and\ntemporal-level information, but also learns dynamic information diffusion\nbetween the two feature spaces through spatial-to-temporal and\ntemporal-to-spatial reasoning. The bidirectional strategy aims to tackle the\nevolving semantics of user queries in the dialogue setting. The retrieved\nvisual cues are used as contextual information to construct relevant responses\nto the users. Our empirical results and comprehensive qualitative analysis show\nthat BiST achieves competitive performance and generates reasonable responses\non a large-scale AVSD benchmark. We also adapt our BiST models to the Video QA\nsetting, and substantially outperform prior approaches on the TGIF-QA\nbenchmark.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 07:43:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-21"}

To solve\nthis issue, a modified QPSK partition algorithm that jointly optimizes the\namplitude decision threshold and filter weight is proposed, where the\noptimization of decision threshold is based on maximum a posterior probability\n(MAP) estimation. Different from the conventional decision methods which\ncommonly use Euclidean distance metric, the MAP-based decision introduces the\nstatistical characteristics of the received signals to obtain an accurate\namplitude partition. In addition, the filter weight is optimized for different\ndecision thresholds to enhance the tolerance of ASE-induced phase noise.

Several successful\nmodifications paired the original functional with different (local) exchange\nfunctionals to improve performance and the successor vdW-DF2 also updated one\ninternal parameter.

However, the\nproblem of how college/university campuses should function during a pandemic is\nnew for the following reasons:(i) social contact in colleges are structured and\ncan be engineered for chosen objectives, (ii) the last pandemic to cause such\nsocietal disruption was over 100 years ago, when higher education was not a\ncritical part of society, (ii) not much was known about causes of pandemics,\nand hence effective ways of safe operations were not known, and (iii) today\nwith distance learning, remote operation of an academic institution is\npossible. Our approach is unique in presenting a flexible simulation system,\ncontaining a suite of model libraries, one for each major component. The system\nintegrates agent based modeling (ABM) and stochastic network approach, and\nmodels the interactions among individual entities, e.g., students, instructors,\nclassrooms, residences, etc. in great detail. For each decision to be made, the\nsystem can be used to predict the impact of various choices, and thus enable\nthe administrator to make informed decisions. While current approaches are good\nfor infection modeling, they lack accuracy in social contact modeling. Our ABM\napproach, combined with ideas from Network Science, presents a novel approach\nto contact modeling. A detailed case study of the University of Minnesota's\nSunrise Plan is presented. For each decisions made, its impact was assessed,\nand results used to get a measure of confidence. We believe this flexible tool\ncan be a valuable asset for various kinds of organizations to assess their\ninfection risks in pandemic-time operations, including middle and high schools,\nfactories, warehouses, and small/medium sized businesses.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 08:10:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-21"}

This paper develops\nfast dynamic algorithms for sparse spanner and emulator maintenance and\nprovides evidence from fine-grained complexity that these algorithms are tight.\n  Under the popular OMv conjecture, we show that there can be no decremental or\nincremental algorithm that maintains an $n^{1+o(1)}$ edge (purely additive)\n$+n^{\\delta}$-emulator for any $\\delta<1/2$ with arbitrary polynomial\npreprocessing time and total update time $m^{1+o(1)}$.

A system is said to be opaque\nif the intruder, which is modeled as a passive observer, can never infer\nconfidently that the system is at a secret state. The design objective is to\nsynthesize a supervisor such that the closed-loop system is opaque even when\nthe control policy is publicly known. In this paper, we propose a new approach\nfor enforcing opacity using non-deterministic supervisors. A non-deterministic\nsupervisor is a decision mechanism that provides a set of control decisions at\neach instant, and randomly picks a specific control decision from the decision\nset to actually control the plant. Compared with the standard deterministic\ncontrol mechanism, such a non-deterministic control mechanism can enhance the\nplausible deniability of the controlled system as the online control decision\nis a random realization and cannot be implicitly inferred from the control\npolicy. We provide a sound and complete algorithm for synthesizing a\nnon-deterministic opacity-enforcing supervisor. Furthermore, we show that\nnon-deterministic supervisors are strictly more powerful than deterministic\nsupervisors in the sense that there may exist a non-deterministic\nopacity-enforcing supervisor even when deterministic supervisors cannot enforce\nopacity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 09:31:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Nov 2021 07:50:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-23"}

The massive computational capability\nof edge devices such as mobile phones, coupled with privacy concerns, has led\nto a surging interest in federated learning (FL) which focuses on collaborative\ntraining of deep neural networks (DNNs) via first-order optimization\ntechniques. However, some common machine learning tasks such as hyperparameter\ntuning of DNNs lack access to gradients and thus require zeroth-order/black-box\noptimization.

This\npaper presents federated Thompson sampling (FTS) which overcomes a number of\nkey challenges of FBO and FL in a principled way: We (a) use random Fourier\nfeatures to approximate the Gaussian process surrogate model used in BO, which\nnaturally produces the parameters to be exchanged between agents, (b) design\nFTS based on Thompson sampling, which significantly reduces the number of\nparameters to be exchanged, and (c) provide a theoretical convergence guarantee\nthat is robust against heterogeneous agents, which is a major challenge in FL\nand FBO.

Bando et al., Plasma Phys. Control. Fusion\n61 115014 (2019)]. In this paper, we have investigated the excitation mechanism\nof n = 1 HCs with m/n = 2/1 TMs based on the experimental observations and a\nsimple quasi-linear MHD model. In the previous study, it was reported that a\n\"coupling\" on the phase of the MHD mode is observed between n = 1 HCs and m/n =\n2/1 TMs. In this study, it is found that the coupling is observed with the mode\nfrequency from several Hz to 6 kHz. This indicates that the resistive wall and\nthe plasma control system do not induce the coupling because the both time\nscales are different from the mode frequency. In addition, n = 1 HCs appear to\nbe the non-resonant mode from the two observations: n = 1 HCs do not rotate\nwith the plasma around the q = 1 surface in the core and the coupling is also\nobserved even when qmin > 1. It is also observed that the electron fluctuation\ndue to an n = 1 HC in the core region disappears with the stabilization of an\nm/n = 2/1 neoclassical tearing mode by electron cyclotron current drive,\nimplying that n = 1 HCs are driven by m/n = 2/1 TMs. This perspective, n = 1\nHCs are driven by m/n = 2/1 TMs, is supported by the observation that the\nsaturated amplitude of the m/n = 1/1 component of the radial displacement in\nthe core is smaller than that of the m/n = 2/1 component. Finally, we revisit a\nquasi-linear MHD model where the m/n = 1/1 HC is induced directly by the\nsideband of the current for the m/n = 2/1 TM, which allows to excite the\nnon-resonant m/n = 1/1 mode. The model also describes the characteristic of the\ncoupling, fm/n=1/1(HC) = 2fm/n=2/1(TM).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 10:10:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2020 04:55:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-21"}

Over the last few years, improvements of the sensor performance\nare gradually approaching to a saturation. In this work we present our new\nconcept to overcome the intrinsic limitations of planar configurations of\nelectrodes. Our non-planar technology is based on focusing and enhancing the\nelectric fields by tip-like electrodes. The shape of the electric field and the\nlack of typical micro-cell edges, allows us to exclude cell separation\nboundaries and eliminate dead space around active cell areas. Our design\nprovides a high-density micro-cell layout with a high geometric efficiency. It\nresolves the well-known trade-off between the detection efficiency and the\ndynamic range. The first \"Tip Avalanche Photodiode\" (TAPD) prototypes show a\nremarkable geometric efficiency above 80% for a micro-cell pitch of\n15$\\mathrm{\\mu}$m. This directly translates into a photon detection efficiency\n(PDE) record peak value of 73% at 600nm with respect to the state-of-the-art\nSiPMs. Moreover, the PDE remains above a value of 45% up to a wavelength of\n800nm with another record value of 22% at 905nm. The reduced micro-cell\ncapacity allows for a fast recovery time below 4ns, which improves the\noperation at high photon rates. Overall, the TAPD is anticipated to be a very\npromising SiPM generation for various wide-spectral and high-dynamic-range\napplications in health science, biophysics, particle physics and LiDARs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 10:44:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-21"}

In\nclassical DCOPs, variables owned by agents are assumed to be discrete. However,\nin many applications, such as target tracking or sleep scheduling in sensor\nnetworks, continuous-valued variables are more suitable than discrete ones. To\nbetter model such applications, researchers have proposed Continuous DCOPs\n(C-DCOPs), an extension of DCOPs, that can explicitly model problems with\ncontinuous variables. The state-of-the-art approaches for solving C-DCOPs\nexperience either onerous memory or computation overhead and unsuitable for\nnon-differentiable optimization problems. To address this issue, we propose a\nnew C-DCOP algorithm, namely Particle Swarm Optimization Based C-DCOP (PCD),\nwhich is inspired by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), a well-known\ncentralized population-based approach for solving continuous optimization\nproblems. In recent years, population-based algorithms have gained significant\nattention in classical DCOPs due to their ability in producing high-quality\nsolutions. Nonetheless, to the best of our knowledge, this class of algorithms\nhas not been utilized to solve C-DCOPs and there has been no work evaluating\nthe potential of PSO in solving classical DCOPs or C-DCOPs. In light of this\nobservation, we adapted PSO, a centralized algorithm, to solve C-DCOPs in a\ndecentralized manner. The resulting PCD algorithm not only produces\ngood-quality solutions but also finds solutions without any requirement for\nderivative calculations. Moreover, we design a crossover operator that can be\nused by PCD to further improve the quality of solutions found. Finally, we\ntheoretically prove that PCD is an anytime algorithm and empirically evaluate\nPCD against the state-of-the-art C-DCOP algorithms in a wide variety of\nbenchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 11:04:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-21"}

In this paper, we consider the involved least-squares problem\nand add different forms of regularization: Classical Tikhonov-regularization,\nnamely, regularized least squares and the technique of group lasso, which\npromotes sparsity in the groups. As for the latter, there are no explicit\nsolution formulas which is why we applied the fast iterative\nshrinking-thresholding algorithm to obtain the minimizer. Moreover, we discuss\nthe possibility of incorporating smoothness information into the least-squares\nproblem. Numerical experiments in under-, overdetermined, and noisy settings\nindicate the applicability of our algorithms. While we consider periodic\nfunctions, the idea can be directly generalized to non-periodic functions as\nwell.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 11:23:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 7 Nov 2021 09:40:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-09"}

Determining their shape and size could provide\nevidence of their origin, which is still unclear. Previous work with a single\nsolar wind stream has indicated that these are long, thin structures although\nthe direction of their major axis could not be determined. We investigate if\nthis long, thin nature extends to other solar wind streams, while determining\nthe direction along which the switchbacks within a stream were aligned. We try\nto understand how the size and orientation of the switchbacks, along with the\nflow velocity and spacecraft trajectory, combine to produce the observed\nstructure durations for past and future orbits. We searched for the alignment\ndirection that produced a combination of a spacecraft cutting direction and\nswitchback duration that was most consistent with long, thin structures. The\nexpected form of a long, thin structure was fitted to the results of the best\nalignment direction, which determined the width and aspect ratio of the\nswitchbacks for that stream. The switchbacks had a mean width of $50,000 \\,\n\\rm{km}$, with an aspect ratio of the order of $10$. We find that switchbacks\nare not aligned along the background flow direction, but instead aligned along\nthe local Parker spiral, perhaps suggesting that they propagate along the\nmagnetic field. Since the observed switchback duration depends on how the\nspacecraft cuts through the structure, the duration alone cannot be used to\ndetermine the size or influence of an individual event. For future PSP orbits,\na larger spacecraft transverse component combined with more radially aligned\nswitchbacks will lead to long duration switchbacks becoming less common.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 11:47:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-02"}

The jittering jets\nexplosion mechanism accounts for the misalignment of the post-kick jets axis\nand the main-jets axis of the ejecta. For post-kick jets to shape the bipolar\nlobe their energy should have been about equal to the energy of the ejecta\ninner to the outer edge of the lobe, E(2j)~E(ej,lobe)~4.6e48erg.

Three barriers always hamper the research: unknown\nbaseband design and its influence, inadequate hardware, and the lack of\nversatile and flexible measurement software. This paper tries to eliminate\nthese barriers through the following work. First, we present an in-depth study\nof the baseband design of the Qualcomm Atheros AR9300 (QCA9300) NIC. We\nidentify a missing item of the existing CSI model, namely, the CSI distortion,\nand identify the baseband filter as its origin. We also propose a distortion\nremoval method. Second, we reintroduce both the QCA9300 and software-defined\nradio (SDR) as powerful hardware for research. For the QCA9300, we unlock the\narbitrary tuning of both the carrier frequency and bandwidth. For SDR, we\ndevelop a high?performance software implementation of the 802.11a/g/n/ac/ax\nbaseband, allowing users to fully control the baseband and access the complete\nphysical-layer information.

In this sense,\nmagnetic fields avoid a runaway deceleration process. Furthermore, when the\nmass-load is large enough to increase the jet density and produce fast,\ndifferential jet expansion, the conversion of magnetic energy flux into kinetic\nenergy flux (i.e., magnetic acceleration), helps to delay the deceleration\nprocess with respect to non-magnetised jets. We conclude that the typical\nstellar population in elliptical galaxies cannot explain jet deceleration in\nclassical FRI radio galaxies.

We first show that the freedom on the\ncoordinate velocity of a general time-parametrised coordinate system with\nrespect to a Galilean reference system is similar to the shift freedom in the\n3+1-formalism of general relativity. This allows us to write Newton's theory as\nliving in a 4-dimensional Lorentzian manifold $M^N$. This manifold can be\nchosen to be curved depending on the dynamics of the Newtonian fluid. In this\npaper, we focus on a specific choice for $M^N$ leading to what we call the\n\\textit{1+3-Newton equations}. We show that these equations can be recovered\nfrom general relativity with a Newtonian limit performed in the rest frames of\nthe relativistic fluid. The 1+3 formulation of the Newton equations along with\nthe Newtonian limit we introduce also allow us to define a dictionary between\nNewton's theory and general relativity. This dictionary is defined in the rest\nframes of the dust fluid, i.e. a non-accelerating observer. A consequence of\nthis is that it is only defined for irrotational fluids. As an example\nsupporting the 1+3-Newton equations and our dictionary, we show that the\nparabolic free-fall solution in 1+3-Newton exactly translates into the\nSchwarzschild spacetime, and this without any approximations. The dictionary\nmight then be an additional tool to test the validity of Newtonian solutions\nwith respect to general relativity. It however needs to be further tested for\nnon-vacuum, non-stationary and non-isolated Newtonian solutions, as well as to\nbe adapted for rotational fluids.

This paper presents a\nspace-based analysis of the BS on/off control system to which a stochastic\ngeometric approach is applied. In particular, we derive the approximated\nclosed-form expression of the coverage probability of a homogeneous network\n(HomNet) with the user-number threshold-based on/off control. Moreover, the\noptimal user-number threshold for maximizing the coverage probability is\nanalytically derived. In addition to HomNet, we also derive the overall\ncoverage probability and the optimal user-number thresholds for a heterogeneous\nnetwork (HetNet). The results show that HetNet, the analysis of which seems\nintractable, can be analyzed in the form of a linear combination of HomNets\nwith weighted densities. In addition, the optimal user-number threshold of each\ntier is obtained independently of other tiers. The modeling and analysis\npresented in this paper are not only limited to the case of user-number\nthreshold-based on/off control, but also applicable to other novel on/off\ncontrols with minor modifications.

To address this issue, we propose an anisotropic graph\nconvolutional network for semi-supervised node classification by introducing a\nnonlinear function that captures informative features from nodes, while\npreventing oversmoothing. The proposed framework is largely motivated by the\ngood performance of anisotropic diffusion in image and geometry processing, and\nlearns nonlinear representations based on local graph structure and node\nfeatures.

On the other hand, gradual patterns that capture\nco-variation of complex attributes in the form of \" when X increases/decreases,\nY increases/decreases\" play an important role in many real world applications\nwhere huge volumes of complex numerical data must be handled. Recently, these\npatterns have received attention from the data mining community exploring\ntemporal data who proposed methods to automatically extract gradual patterns\nfrom temporal data. However, to the best of our knowledge, no method has been\nproposed to extract gradual patterns that regularly appear at identical time\nintervals in many sequences of temporal data, despite the fact that such\npatterns may add knowledge to certain applications, such as e-commerce. In this\npaper, we propose to extract co-variations of periodically repeating attributes\nfrom the sequences of temporal data that we call seasonal gradual patterns. For\nthis purpose, we formulate the task of mining seasonal gradual patterns as the\nproblem of mining periodic patterns in multiple sequences and then we exploit\nperiodic pattern mining algorithms to extract seasonal gradual patterns. We\ndiscuss specific features of these patterns and propose an approach for their\nextraction based on mining periodic frequent patterns common to multiple\nsequences. We also propose a new anti-monotonous support definition associated\nto these seasonal gradual patterns. The illustrative results obtained from some\nreal world data sets show that the proposed approach is efficient and that it\ncan extract small sets of patterns by filtering numerous nonseasonal patterns\nto identify the seasonal ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 14:03:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-21"}

In view of the currently proposed experiments by DUNE, SHiP and\nDsTau collaborations to study the production of $\\tau$ lepton, an updated\ncalculation of the cross sections and polarizations of tau leptons in the case\nof quasielastic production have been done and the numerical results have been\npresented along with a discussion of the theoretical uncertainties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 14:21:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-04"}

In this paper we address the computational complexity of\nthe associated graph optimisation problem. We demonstrate that this problem\ncannot be solved in polynomial time unless P = NP; we further show\nintractability for two simpler variants of the problem. We follow these results\nwith two parameterised algorithms that exactly solve the problem. Both of these\nsolve not only the decision problem, but also enumerate all solutions with\npolynomial time precalculation, delay, and postcalculation time in respective\nrestricted settings. For this problem, efficient enumeration allows the\nuncertainty in the spatial correlation to be utilised in the modelling. The\nfirst enumeration algorithm utilises dynamic programming on a tree\ndecomposition, and has polynomial time precalculation and linear delay if both\nthe treewidth and maximum degree are bounded.

The data in the article is taken from\nthese three sources. The number of excess deaths is defined as the number of\ndeaths minus the baseline, the definition of which varies from country to\ncountry. In the UK it is the average number of deaths over the last five years,\nin Germany it is over the last four years and in Belgium over the last 11\nyears.

It\ntherefore enables more robust and accurate comparisons of different countries.\nThe article criticizes the use of Z-scores which distort the comparison between\ncountries.

Recent\nobservations have revealed radio bridges for some pairs of very closeby galaxy\nclusters. The mechanisms that may allow to explain the high specific density of\nrelativistic electrons, necessary to explain the radio luminosity of these\nbridge regions, are poorly explored. We analyse the galaxy cluster Abell 1430\nwith LoTSS data in detail and complement it with recent JVLA L-band\nobservations, XMM-Newton, Chandra, and SDSS data. Moreover, we compare our\nresults to clusters extracted from the \"The Three Hundred Project\" cosmological\nsimulation. We find that Abell 1430 consists of two components, namely A1430-A\nand A1430-B. We speculate that the two components undergo an off-axis merger.\nThe more massive component shows diffuse radio emission which can be classified\nas radio halo showing a low radio power given the mass of the cluster. Most\ninterestingly, there is extended diffuse radio emission, dubbed as the\n`Pillow', which is apparently related to A1430-B and thus related to low\ndensity intracluster or intergalactic medium. To date, a only few examples for\nemission originating from such regions are known. These discoveries are crucial\nto constrain possible acceleration mechanisms, which may allow to explain the\npresence of relativistic electrons in these regions. Our results indicate a\nspectral index of $\\alpha_{144\\,\\text{MHz}}^{1.5\\,\\text{GHz}}=-1.4\\pm0.5$ for\nthe Pillow. If future observations confirm a slope as flat as the central value\nof -1.4 or even flatter, this would pose a severe challenge for the electron\nacceleration scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 14:52:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 30 Jun 2021 16:05:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-13"}

First, we compare\ncomputationally expensive, adaptive network simulations with their\ncorresponding computationally highly efficient ODE equivalents and find\nexcellent agreement. Second, we discover that there exists a relatively simple\ncritical curve in parameter space for the epidemic threshold, which strongly\nsuggests that there is a mutual compensation effect between the two mitigation\nstrategies: as long as social distancing and quarantine measures are both\nsufficiently strong, large outbreaks are prevented. Third, we study the total\nnumber of infected and the maximum peak during large outbreaks using a\ncombination of analytical estimates and numerical simulations.

Two essential questions are:\na) how are such codes formed on the basis of single trials, and how is\nsimilarity preserved during learning, i.e., how do more similar inputs get\nmapped to more similar SDCs. I describe a novel Modular Sparse Distributed Code\n(MSDC) that provides simple, neurally plausible answers to both questions. An\nMSDC coding field (CF) consists of Q WTA competitive modules (CMs), each\ncomprised of K binary units (analogs of principal cells). The modular nature of\nthe CF makes possible a single-trial, unsupervised learning algorithm that\napproximately preserves similarity and crucially, runs in fixed time, i.e., the\nnumber of steps needed to store an item remains constant as the number of\nstored items grows. Further, once items are stored as MSDCs in superposition\nand such that their intersection structure reflects input similarity, both\nfixed time best-match retrieval and fixed time belief update (updating the\nprobabilities of all stored items) also become possible. The algorithm's core\nprinciple is simply to add noise into the process of choosing a code, i.e.,\nchoosing a winner in each CM, which is proportional to the novelty of the\ninput. This causes the expected intersection of the code for an input, X, with\nthe code of each previously stored input, Y, to be proportional to the\nsimilarity of X and Y. Results demonstrating these capabilities for spatial\npatterns are given in the appendix.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 17:36:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-22"}

Non-stochastic methods of fuzzy\ntime series forecasting are preferred by the researchers as they provide more\nsignificant forecasting results. There are generally, four factors that\ndetermine the performance of the forecasting method (1) number of intervals\n(NOIs) and length of intervals to partition universe of discourse (UOD) (2)\nfuzzification rules or feature representation of crisp time series (3) method\nof establishing fuzzy logic rule (FLRs) between input and target values (4)\ndefuzzification rule to get crisp forecasted value. Considering the first two\nfactors to improve the forecasting accuracy, we proposed a novel non-stochastic\nmethod fuzzy time series forecasting in which interval index number and\nmembership value are used as input features to predict future value. We\nsuggested a simple rounding-off range and suitable step size method to find the\noptimal number of intervals (NOIs) and used fuzzy c-means clustering process to\ndivide UOD into intervals of unequal length. We implement support vector\nmachine (SVM) to establish FLRs. To test our proposed method we conduct a\nsimulated study on five widely used real time series and compare the\nperformance with some recently developed models. We also examine the\nperformance of the proposed model by using multi-layer perceptron (MLP) instead\nof SVM. Two performance measures RSME and SMAPE are used for performance\nanalysis and observed better forecasting accuracy by the proposed model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 08:14:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-23"}

These models have had varying degrees of\nsuccesses. Models such as Linear Discriminant Analysis or Artificial Neural\nNetwork employ discriminative classification techniques. They lack explicit\nprovision to include prior expert knowledge. In this paper, we propose another\nroute of generative modeling using Expert Bayesian framework. The biggest\nadvantage of the proposed framework is an explicit inclusion of expert judgment\nin the modeling process. Also the proposed methodology provides a way to\nquantify uncertainty in prediction. As a result the model built using Bayesian\nframework is highly flexible, interpretable and intuitive in nature. The\nproposed approach is well suited for highly regulated or safety critical\napplications such as in finance or in medical diagnosis. In such cases accuracy\nin the prediction is not the only concern for decision makers. Decision makers\nand other stakeholders are also interested in uncertainty in the prediction as\nwell as interpretability of the model. We empirically demonstrate these\nbenefits of proposed framework on real world dataset using Stan, a\nprobabilistic programming language. We found that the proposed model is either\ncomparable or superior to the other existing methods. Also resulting model has\nmuch less False Positive Rate compared to many existing state of the art\nmethods. The corresponding R code for the experiments is available at Github\nrepository.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 19:09:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2020 05:30:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-02"}

Estimation of\ncrowd size in an outdoor environment is essential in the Echo-period. Making a\nsimple and flexible working system for the same is the need of the hour. This\narticle proposes and evaluates a non-intrusive, passive, and costeffective\nsolution for crowd size estimation in an outdoor environment. We call the\nproposed system as LTE communication infrastructure based environment sensing\nor LTE-CommSense. This system does not need any active signal transmission as\nit uses LTE transmitted signal. So, this is a power-efficient, simple low\nfootprint device. Importantly, the personal identity of the people in the crowd\ncan not be obtained using this method. First, the system uses practical data to\ndetermine whether the outdoor environment is empty or not. If not, it tries to\nestimate the number of people occupying the near range locality. Performance\nevaluation with practical data confirms the feasibility of this proposed\napproach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 12:22:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-01"}
