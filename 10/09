We employ a kinetic equation\napproach for the electron, positron and photon distributions, each of them\nspin/polarization-resolved, with the QED effects of photon emission and pair\nproduction modelled by a spin/polarization dependent Boltzmann-type collision\noperator.

The transition proceeds via percolation of bubbles of IR-brane\nnucleating from the black-brane horizon. The violent bubble dynamics can be a\npowerful source of observable stochastic gravitational waves. While bubble\nnucleation is non-perturbative in 5D gravity, it is amenable to semiclassical\ntreatment in terms of a \"bounce\" configuration interpolating between the two\nphases. We demonstrate how such a bounce configuration can be smooth enough to\nmaintain 5D effective field theory control, and how a simple ansatz for it\nplaces a rigorous lower-bound on the transition rate in the thin-wall regime,\nand gives plausible estimates more generally. When applied to the Hierarchy\nProblem, the minimal Goldberger-Wise stabilization of the warped throat leads\nto a slow transition with significant supercooling. We demonstrate that a\nsimple generalization of the Goldberger-Wise potential modifies the IR-brane\ndynamics so that the transition completes more promptly.

METI proponents point to the\nSETI Paradox - if all civilisations refrain from METI then SETI is futile. I\nintroduce Mutual Detectability as a game-theoretic strategy aimed at increasing\nthe success potential of targeted SETI. Mutual detectability is embodied by\nfour laws: mutuality, symmetry, opportunity and superiority. These laws\nestablish how SETI participants can engage each other using game theory\nprinciples applied to mutual evidence of mutual existence. The law of\nsuperiority establishes an \"onus to transmit\" on the party whom both SETI\nparticipants can judge to have better quality evidence, or common denominator\ninformation (CDI), thus avoiding the SETI Paradox. I argue that transiting\nexoplanets within the Earth Transit Zone form a target subset that satisfies\nmutual detectability requirements. I identify the intrinsic time-integrated\ntransit signal strength as suitable CDI. Civilisations on habitable-zone\nplanets of radius $R_{\\rm p}/R_{\\oplus} \\lesssim (L_*/L_{\\odot})^{-1/7}$ have\nsuperior CDI on us, so have game-theory incentive (onus) to transmit. Whilst\nthis implies that the onus to transmit falls on us for habitable planets around\n$L_* > L_{\\odot}$ stars, considerations of relative stellar frequency,\nmain-sequence lifetime and planet occurrence mean such systems are likely a\nsmall minority. Surveys of the Earth Transit Zone for Earth-analogue transits\naround sub-solar luminosity hosts, followed up by targeted SETI monitoring of\nthem, represent an efficient strategy compliant with mutual detectability.

The proposed model reformulates the classical equilibrium model by\nintroducing a new non-dimensional mixing-length function.

As a result, the newly\nintroduced mixing-length function exhibits great universality within the\nviscous sublayer, the buffer layer, and the log region (i.e., $0 < y <\n0.1\\delta$, where the wall model is typically deployed in a WMLES setup).

It has been suggested in the literature that such a state may\narise in connection with the theory being close to the unitarity bound in\nholographic models. We extend these ideas to cases where the background\ngeometry is non-AdS, and the gravity description of the dual confining field\ntheory has a top-down origin in supergravity.\n  We exemplify this programme by studying the circle compactification of Romans\nsix-dimensional half-maximal supergravity. We uncover a rich space of\nsolutions, many of which were previously unknown in the literature. We compute\nthe bosonic spectrum of excitations, and identify a tachyonic instability in a\nregion of parameter space for a class of regular background solutions. A\ntachyon only exists along an energetically disfavoured (unphysical) branch of\nsolutions of the gravity theory; we find evidence of a first-order phase\ntransition that separates this region of parameter space from the physical one.\nAlong the physical branch of regular solutions, one of the lightest scalar\nparticles is approximately a dilaton, and it is associated with a condensate in\nthe underlying theory. Yet, because of the location of the phase transition,\nits mass is not parametrically small, and it is, coincidentally, the\nnext-to-lightest scalar bound state, rather than the lightest one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Oct 2020 16:32:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 17:16:17 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 31 Mar 2021 10:57:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-26"}

The large-area (quasi-)vdW epitaxy of layered 2D chalcogenides is\nconsequently carefully being researched since these materials hold very\npromising properties for future nanoelectronic applications. The formation of\ndefects such as stacking faults like 60o twins and consequently 60o grain\nboundaries is still of major concern for the defect-free epitaxial growth of 2D\nchalcogenides. Although growth strategies to overcome the occurrence of these\ndefects are currently being considered, more fundamental understanding on the\norigin of these defects at the initial stages of the growth is highly\nessential. Therefore this work focuses on the understanding of 60o twin\nformation in (quasi-)vdW epitaxy of 2D chalcogenides relying on systematic\nmolecular beam epitaxy (MBE) experiments supported by density functional theory\n(DFT) calculations. The MBE experiments reveal the striking difference in 60o\ntwin formation between WSe2 and Bi2Se3 in both quasi-vdW heteroepitaxy and vdW\nhomoepitaxy, which from our DFT calculations links to the difference in\ninterlayer vdW coupling strength. The stronger interlayer vdW coupling in\nBi2Se3 compared to WSe2 results in a striking enhanced control on twin\nformation and hence shows significantly more promise for defect-free epitaxial\nintegration. This interesting aspect of (quasi-)vdW epitaxy reveals that the\nstrength of interlayer vdW coupling is key for functional 2D materials and\nopens perspectives for other vdW materials sharing strong interlayer\ninteractions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Oct 2020 16:39:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-09"}

These problems have a set of optimal solutions, called the Pareto\nfront, where each point on the front represents a different trade-off between\npossibly conflicting objectives. Recent MOO methods can target a specific\ndesired ray in loss space however, most approaches still face two grave\nlimitations: (i) A separate model has to be trained for each point on the\nfront; and (ii) The exact trade-off must be known before the optimization\nprocess. Here, we tackle the problem of learning the entire Pareto front, with\nthe capability of selecting a desired operating point on the front after\ntraining. We call this new setup Pareto-Front Learning (PFL).\n  We describe an approach to PFL implemented using HyperNetworks, which we term\nPareto HyperNetworks (PHNs). PHN learns the entire Pareto front simultaneously\nusing a single hypernetwork, which receives as input a desired preference\nvector and returns a Pareto-optimal model whose loss vector is in the desired\nray. The unified model is runtime efficient compared to training multiple\nmodels and generalizes to new operating points not used during training. We\nevaluate our method on a wide set of problems, from multi-task regression and\nclassification to fairness. PHNs learn the entire Pareto front at roughly the\nsame time as learning a single point on the front and at the same time reach a\nbetter solution set. Furthermore, we show that PHNs can scale to generate large\nmodels like ResNet18. PFL opens the door to new applications where models are\nselected based on preferences that are only available at run time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Oct 2020 16:39:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Apr 2021 07:18:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-27"}

(2) Using the CoS-E and e-SNLI datasets, we evaluate two existing\ngenerative graphical models and two new approaches; one rationalizing method we\nintroduce achieves roughly human-level LAS scores. (3) Lastly, we frame\nexplanation generation as a multi-agent game and optimize explanations for\nsimulatability while penalizing label leakage, which can improve LAS scores. We\nprovide code for the experiments in this paper at\nhttps://github.com/peterbhase/LAS-NL-Explanations\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Oct 2020 16:59:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-09"}

Periodic\nradar blackout/weakening of radar signals at Mars are observed by MARSIS/MEX,\nassociated with these solar energetic electron enhancements.

A core problem in solving the\nassistance dilemma is the need to discover when students are unproductive so\nthat the tutor can intervene. Such a task is particularly challenging for\nopen-ended domains, even those that are well-structured with defined principles\nand goals. In this paper, we present a set of data-driven methods to classify,\npredict, and prevent unproductive problem-solving steps in the well-structured\nopen-ended domain of logic. This approach leverages and extends the Hint\nFactory, a set of methods that leverages prior student solution attempts to\nbuild data-driven intelligent tutors. We present a HelpNeed classification,\nthat uses prior student data to determine when students are likely to be\nunproductive and need help learning optimal problem-solving strategies.

Furthermore, the results\nshow that the students who received Adaptive hints based on HelpNeed\npredictions during training significantly outperform their Control peers on the\nposttest, with the former producing shorter, more optimal solutions in less\ntime.

We study how the formation of gaseous nuclear rings\nis affected by changing the bar pattern speed and the strength of the\nturbulence, and compare the results to simulations with a relatively high sound\nspeed. We use two values for the bar pattern speed that have been discussed in\nthe literature for our Milky Way Galaxy (40 and 63 km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$). Our\nresults show that turbulence produces broader and smaller nuclear rings, and\nenhances gas migration towards the inner few pc of the galaxy, compared to\nsimulations without turbulence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Oct 2020 18:00:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Oct 2020 01:31:52 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 27 Apr 2021 01:51:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-28"}

In this setup, the mass of the axion field is dependent on\nthe radial field because of the nonminimal coupling, and the axion remains\nextremely light during the phase of radial inflation. As the radial field\napproaches the minimum of its potential, there is a transition to natural\ninflation in the angular direction.

Second, to\ndemonstrate that systems and control theory provides a natural context for the\nformulation and understanding of classical thermodynamics.

In particular, it will be shown that\ndissipativity theory is key in the formulation and interpretation of the First\nand Second Law of thermodynamics. Also a geometric view on the state properties\nand the dynamics of thermodynamic systems will be emphasized, thereby unifying\nand simplifying different representations of thermodynamic systems. On the\nother hand, I will also argue that thermodynamics motivates paradigm shifts\nwithin systems and control; in particular, the use of non-minimal state space\nformulations, and a geometric view on them. Furthermore, while systems and\ncontrol theory has been primarily based on linear systems with quadratic cost\ncriteria, in line with basic system models in electrical and mechanical\nengineering (RLC-circuits, mass-spring-damper systems, etc.), thermodynamics\nnecessitates to go beyond this linear-quadratic paradigm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Oct 2020 18:54:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-12"}

In the first point of view, we interpret that a\nparticle-antiparticle pair is created and the negative energy antiparticle\nfalls into the black hole. On the other point of view, a particle inside the\nhorizon, or beyond the Einstein-Rosen bridge, tunnels to outside the horizon,\nwhere this computation requires the analytic continuation of the time. These\ntwo faces of the Hawking radiation process can be extended to not only\nparticles but also fields. As a concrete example, we study the thin-shell\ntunneling process; by introducing the antishell as a negative tension shell, we\ncan give the consistent interpretation for two pictures, where one is a\ntunneling from inside to outside the horizon using instantons, while the other\nis a shell-antishell pair-creation. This shows that the Euclidean path integral\nindeed carries vast physical implications not only for perturbative, but also\nfor non-perturbative processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Oct 2020 19:57:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Aug 2021 01:48:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-19"}

The impact of\nvibrations and of the one- and two-phonon VAET processes on the energy transfer\nare seen to be quite different in the weak and strong site-vibration coupling\nregimes. In the weak coupling regime, two-phonon processes dominate, whereas in\nthe strong coupling regime up to six-phonon VAET processes can be induced. The\nVAET features are seen to be enhanced with increasing temperature and\nsite-vibration coupling strength, and are reduced in the presence of\ndissipation. We analyze the dependence of these phenomena on the explicit form\nof the chromophore-vibration couplings, with comparison of VAET spectra for\nlocal and non-local couplings.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Oct 2020 21:00:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-09"}

They state that in\nthis new, VMG-KLJN, non-equilibrium system with nonzero power flow, the\nsecurity during the exchange of the two (HL and LH) bit values is as strong as\nin the original KLJN scheme. Moreover, they claim that, at practical\nconditions, their VMG-KLJN protocol \"supports more robust protection against\nattacks\". First, we investigate the power flow and thermal equilibrium issues\nof the VMG-KLJN system with 4 arbitrary resistors. Then we introduce a new KLJN\nprotocol that allows the arbitrary choice of 3 resistors from the 4, while it\nstill operates with zero power flow during the exchange of single bits by\nutilizing a specific value of the 4th resistor and a binary temperature set for\nthe exchanged (HL and LH) bit values. Then we show that, in general, the KLJN\nschemes with more than 2 arbitrary resistors (including our new protocol\nmentioned above) are prone to 4 new passive attacks utilizing the parasitic\ncapacitance and inductance in the cable, while the original KLJN scheme is\nnaturally immune against these new attacks. The core of the security\nvulnerability exploited by these attacks is the different line resistances in\nthe HL and LH cases. Therefore, on the contrary of the statement and claim\ncited above, the practical VMG-KLJN system is less secure than the original\nKLJN scheme. We introduce another 2, modified, non-equilibrium KLJN systems to\neliminate the vulnerability against some - but not all - of these attacks.\nHowever the price for that is the loss of arbitrariness of the selection of the\n4th resistor and the information leak still remains greater than zero.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Oct 2020 22:03:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-07"}

Existing algorithms that are sound (i.e., output\nonly actual fault explanations) and complete (i.e., can return all\nexplanations), however, require exponential space to achieve this task. As a\nremedy, we propose two novel diagnostic search algorithms, called RBF-HS\n(Recursive Best-First Hitting Set Search) and HBF-HS (Hybrid Best-First Hitting\nSet Search), which build upon tried and tested techniques from the heuristic\nsearch domain.

For the computation of minimum-cardinality fault explanations, we\nfind that (1) RBF-HS reduces memory requirements substantially in most cases by\nup to several orders of magnitude, (2) in more than a third of the cases, both\nmemory savings and runtime savings are achieved, and (3) given the runtime\noverhead is significant, using HBF-HS instead of RBF-HS reduces the runtime to\nvalues comparable with HS-Tree while keeping the used memory reasonably\nbounded. When computing most probable fault explanations, we observe that\nRBF-HS tends to trade memory savings more or less one-to-one for runtime\noverheads.

This paper addresses systems that use range measurements\nbetween mobile agents for the purpose of collision prediction, which involves\nprediction of the agents' future paths to know if they will collide at any\ntime. One straightforward system would use known-location static anchors to\nestimate agent coordinates over time, and use the track to predict collision.\nFundamentally, no fixed coordinate system is required for collision prediction,\nso using only the pairwise range between two agents can be used to predict\ncollision. We present lower bound analysis which shows the limitations of this\npairwise method. As an alternative anchor-free method, we propose the\nfriend-based autonomous collision prediction and tracking (FACT) method that\nuses all measured ranges between nearby (unknown location mobile) agents, in a\ndistributed algorithm, to estimate their relative locations and velocities and\npredict future collisions between agents. Using analysis and simulation, we\nshow the potential for FACT to achieve equal or better collision detection\nperformance compared to other methods, while avoiding the need for anchors. We\nthen build a network of $N$ ultra wideband (UWB) devices and an efficient\nmulti-node protocol which allows all ${\\cal O}(N^2)$ pairwise ranges to be\nmeasured in $N$ slots. We run experiments with up to six independent robot\nagents moving and colliding in a 2D plane and up to four anchor nodes to\ncompare the performance of the collision prediction methods. We show that the\nFACT method can perform better than either other method but without the need\nfor a fixed infrastructure of anchor nodes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Oct 2020 00:53:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-12"}

Isoenergetic one- and two-photon excitations (OPE and TPE)\nin non-centrosymmetric molecules are often assumed to reach the same excited\nstate and, hence, to produce similar excited-state reactivity. We compare the\nsolvent-to-solute excited-state proton transfer of the super photobase FR0-SB\nfollowing isoenergetic OPE and TPE. We find up to 62 % increased reactivity\nfollowing TPE compared to OPE. From steady-state spectroscopy, we rule out the\ninvolvement of different excited states and find that OPE and TPE spectra are\nidentical in non-polar solvents but not in polar ones.

Recent studies demonstrated that DNNs are surprisingly susceptible to\nadversarial examples. Many attack methods have been proposed to understand and\ngenerate adversarial examples, such as gradient based attack, score based\nattack, decision based attack, and transfer based attacks. However, most of\nthese algorithms are ineffective in real-world road sign attack, because (1)\niteratively learning perturbations for each frame is not realistic for a fast\nmoving car and (2) most optimization algorithms traverse all pixels equally\nwithout considering their diverse contribution. To alleviate these problems,\nthis paper proposes the targeted attention attack (TAA) method for real world\nroad sign attack. Specifically, we have made the following contributions: (1)\nwe leverage the soft attention map to highlight those important pixels and skip\nthose zero-contributed areas - this also helps to generate natural\nperturbations, (2) we design an efficient universal attack that optimizes a\nsingle perturbation/noise based on a set of training images under the guidance\nof the pre-trained attention map, (3) we design a simple objective function\nthat can be easily optimized, (4) we evaluate the effectiveness of TAA on real\nworld data sets. Experimental results validate that the TAA method improves the\nattack successful rate (nearly 10%) and reduces the perturbation loss (about a\nquarter) compared with the popular RP2 method. Additionally, our TAA also\nprovides good properties, e.g., transferability and generalization capability.\nWe provide code and data to ensure the reproducibility:\nhttps://github.com/AdvAttack/RoadSignAttack.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Oct 2020 02:31:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Aug 2021 00:49:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 13 Aug 2021 01:29:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-16"}

We\nthen analyze the general case with an arbitrary rank and derive a condition to\nrule out the possibility of having a spurious solution in a ball around the\ntrue solution. The developed conditions lead to much stronger theoretical\nguarantees than the existing bounds on RIP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Oct 2020 03:34:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 2020 19:13:49 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 11 Dec 2020 03:29:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-14"}

In this research, we start from\nanticipating a coarse representation of a deterministic future and then move\ntowards predicting continuous and fine-grained future representations of a\nstochastic process. The example of the former is video action anticipation in\nwhich we are interested in predicting one action label given a partially\nobserved video and the example of the latter is forecasting multiple diverse\ncontinuations of human motion given partially observed one.

We consider both the assumption of a constant fracture energy\nand the case of a fracture energy dependent on the martensitic volume fraction.\nThe framework is implemented in an implicit time integration scheme, with both\nmonolithic and staggered solution strategies. The potential of this formulation\nis showcased by modelling a number of paradigmatic problems. First, a boundary\nlayer model is used to examine crack tip fields and compute crack growth\nresistance curves (R-curves).

This property makes it an exciting\narea of research for financial problems. Asset allocation, where the goal is to\nobtain the weights of the assets that maximize the rewards in a given state of\nthe market considering risk and transaction costs, is a problem easily framed\nusing a reinforcement learning framework. It is first a prediction problem for\nexpected returns and covariance matrix and then an optimization problem for\nreturns, risk, and market impact. Investors and financial researchers have been\nworking with approaches like mean-variance optimization, minimum variance, risk\nparity, and equally weighted and several methods to make expected returns and\ncovariance matrices' predictions more robust. This paper demonstrates the\napplication of reinforcement learning to create a financial model-free solution\nto the asset allocation problem, learning to solve the problem using time\nseries and deep neural networks. We demonstrate this on daily data for the top\n24 stocks in the US equities universe with daily rebalancing. We use a deep\nreinforcement model on US stocks using different architectures. We use Long\nShort Term Memory networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Recurrent Neural\nNetworks and compare them with more traditional portfolio management. The Deep\nReinforcement Learning approach shows better results than traditional\napproaches using a simple reward function and only being given the time series\nof stocks. In Finance, no training to test error generalization results come\nguaranteed. We can say that the modeling framework can deal with time series\nprediction and asset allocation, including transaction costs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Oct 2020 07:25:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-12"}

Particularly, various modified\nstrategies and corresponding mechanism based on the substrate engineering\napplied to the optimization of thickness, nucleation and growth rate are\nhighlighted. Then the alterable adhesion to substrates will also be discussed.\nFurthermore, applying the structural coherence of epitaxial crystals with\nsubstrate, scalable perovskite single-crystalline thin films have been obtained\nand can be transferred onto arbitrary substrates. Substrate engineering also\ncan stabilize the desired perovskite phases by modulating the strain between\ncrystals and substrates. Finally, several key challenges and related solutions\nin the growth of perovskite crystals based on substrate engineering are\nproposed.

The best\nknown algorithm that solves Gathering of disoriented robots with limited\nvisibility assuming oblivious robots needs $\\Theta(n^2)$ rounds [SPAA'11]. The\nlower bound for this algorithm even holds in a simplified closed chain model,\nwhere each robot has exactly two neighbors and the chain connections form a\ncycle. The only existing algorithms achieving a linear number of rounds for\ndisoriented robots assume robots that are located on a two dimensional grid\n[IPDPS'16] and [SPAA'16].

The lights are used\nto initiate and perform so-called runs along the chain. For the start of such\nruns, locally unique robots need to be determined.

The neurons\nin SNNs are non-differential, containing decayed historical states and\ngenerating event-based spikes after their states reaching the firing threshold.\nThese dynamic characteristics of SNNs make it difficult to be directly trained\nwith the standard backpropagation (BP), which is also considered not\nbiologically plausible.

In the\nmessage-passing setting, these bottlenecks are generally communication\noverheads and synchronisation times.

While purely data-driven approaches are arguably\ninsufficient in this context, standard physical modeling based approaches tend\nto be over-simplistic, inducing non-negligible errors. In this work, we\nintroduce the APHYNITY framework, a principled approach for augmenting\nincomplete physical dynamics described by differential equations with deep\ndata-driven models. It consists in decomposing the dynamics into two\ncomponents: a physical component accounting for the dynamics for which we have\nsome prior knowledge, and a data-driven component accounting for errors of the\nphysical model. The learning problem is carefully formulated such that the\nphysical model explains as much of the data as possible, while the data-driven\ncomponent only describes information that cannot be captured by the physical\nmodel, no more, no less. This not only provides the existence and uniqueness\nfor this decomposition, but also ensures interpretability and benefits\ngeneralization. Experiments made on three important use cases, each\nrepresentative of a different family of phenomena, i.e. reaction-diffusion\nequations, wave equations and the non-linear damped pendulum, show that\nAPHYNITY can efficiently leverage approximate physical models to accurately\nforecast the evolution of the system and correctly identify relevant physical\nparameters.

Traditional comment generation methods use\nmanually-crafted templates or information retrieval (IR) techniques to generate\nsummaries for source code. In recent years, neural network-based methods which\nleveraged acclaimed encoder-decoder deep learning framework to learn comment\ngeneration patterns from a large-scale parallel code corpus, have achieved\nimpressive results. However, these emerging methods only take code-related\ninformation as input.

Inspired by the IR-based and template-based approaches, in\nthis paper, we propose a neural comment generation approach where we use the\nexisting comments of similar code snippets as exemplars to guide comment\ngeneration. Specifically, given a piece of code, we first use an IR technique\nto retrieve a similar code snippet and treat its comment as an exemplar. Then\nwe design a novel seq2seq neural network that takes the given code, its AST,\nits similar code, and its exemplar as input, and leverages the information from\nthe exemplar to assist in the target comment generation based on the semantic\nsimilarity between the source code and the similar code.

M_thr can be well described by various fit\nformulae involving stellar parameters of nonrotating NSs. Using these relations\nwe compute which constraints on NS radii and the tidal deformability are set by\ncurrent and future merger detections revealing information about the merger\nproduct. We systematically investigate the impact of the binary mass ratio\nq=M_1/M_2 and assemble different fits, which make different assumptions about\na-priori knowlegde. We find fit formulae for M_thr including an explicit q\ndependence, which are valid in a broad range of 0.7<=q<=1 and which are nearly\nas tight as relations for fixed mass ratios. For most EoS models except extreme\ncases M_thr of asymmetric mergers is equal or smaller than the one of\nequal-mass binaries. The impact of the binary mass asymmetry on M_thr becomes\nstronger with more extreme mass ratios, while M_thr is approximately constant\nfor small deviations from q=1. We describe that a phase transition to\ndeconfined quark matter can leave a characteristic imprint on the collapse\nbehavior. The presence of quark matter can reduce the stability of the remnant\nand thus M_thr relative to a purely hadronic reference model. Comparing the\nthreshold mass and the tidal deformability Lambda_thr of a system with M_thr\ncan yield peculiar combinations of those two quantities, where M_thr is\nparticularly small in relation to Lambda_thr. Hence, a combined measurement of\nboth quantities can indicate the onset of quark deconfinement.

Social\ntipping processes have been suggested as key drivers of sustainability\ntransitions emerging in the fields of technological and energy systems,\npolitical mobilization, financial markets and sociocultural norms and\nbehaviors.\n  Drawing from expert elicitation and comprehensive literature review, we\ndevelop a framework to identify and characterize social tipping processes\ncritical to facilitating rapid social transformations.

In particular, we identify human\nagency, social-institutional network structures, different spatial and temporal\nscales and increased complexity as key distinctive features underlying social\ntipping processes. Building on these characteristics, we propose a formal\ndefinition for social tipping processes and filtering criteria for those\nprocesses that could be decisive for future trajectories to global\nsustainability in the Anthropocene. We illustrate this definition with the\nEuropean political system as an example of potential social tipping processes,\nhighlighting the potential role of the FridaysForFuture movement.\n  Accordingly, this analytical framework for social tipping processes can be\nutilized to illuminate mechanisms for necessary transformative climate change\nmitigation policies and actions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Oct 2020 10:29:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-14"}

After the heavy field becomes tachyonic\nat the end of inflation, rolling rapidly towards its global minimum, the dark\nphoton acquires mass via the Higgs mechanism. To prevent the decay of the\nvector field energy density during inflation, we introduce couplings between\nthe inflaton and the gauge field such that the energy is pumped to the dark\nsector. The setup can generate the observed dark matter abundance for a wide\nrange of the dark photon's mass and with the reheat temperature around\n$10^{12}$ GeV.

That is,\nthe solution found for a subsequent task does not perform well on the previous\nones anymore. However, the relationship between the different minima that the\ntwo training regimes arrive at is not well understood. What sets them apart? Is\nthere a local structure that could explain the difference in performance\nachieved by the two different schemes?

This is due to model\ndiscrepancies, the effect of low-level controllers, uncertainties and sensor\nnoise. To address these issues, we propose a modified version of a standard MPC\napproach used in legged locomotion with viability (weak forward invariance)\nguarantees. In this approach, instead of adding a (conservative) terminal\nconstraint to the problem, we propose to use the measured state projected to\nthe viability kernel in the OCP solved at each control cycle. Moreover, we use\npast experimental data to find the best cost weights, which measure a\ncombination of performance, constraint satisfaction robustness, or stability\n(invariance).

Among them, the pruning and quantizing methods\nexhibit a critical drop in performances by compressing the model parameters.\nWhile the knowledge distillation methods improve the performance of compact\nmodels by focusing on training lightweight networks with the supervision of\ncumbersome networks. In the proposed method, the knowledge distillation has\nbeen performed within the network by constructing multiple branches over the\nprimary stream of the model, known as the self-distillation method. Therefore,\nthe ensemble of sub-neural network models has been proposed to transfer the\nknowledge among themselves with the knowledge distillation policies as well as\nan adversarial learning strategy. Hence, The proposed ensemble of sub-models is\ntrained against a discriminator model adversarially. Besides, their knowledge\nis transferred within the ensemble by four different loss functions.

Active\nQueue Management (AQM) algorithms such as CoDel or PIE, designed for the use on\nsoftware based hosts, offer a flow agnostic remedy to Bufferbloat by\ncontrolling the queue filling and hence the latency through subtle packet\ndrops. In previous work, we have shown that the data plane programming language\nP4 is powerful enough to implement the CoDel algorithm.

The problem comes in several versions: global\nversus local alignment; pairwise versus multiple alignment; one-to-one versus\nmany-to-many alignment. Heuristics to address the various instances of the\nproblem abound and they achieve some degree of success when their performance\nis measured in terms of node and/or edges conservation.

In\ncontrast to the previous approach, which uses gradients for representation, we\nutilize only the outputs from the last hidden layer of a neural network and do\nnot use a backward step. The proposed technique explicitly takes into account\nthe initial task and significantly reduces the size of the vector\nrepresentation, as well as the computation time. The key point is minimization\nof information loss between layers. Generally, a neural network discards\ninformation that is not related to the problem, which makes the last hidden\nlayer representation useless for input similarity task. In this work, we\nconsider two main causes of information loss: correlation between neurons and\ninsufficient size of the last hidden layer. To reduce the correlation between\nneurons we use orthogonal weight initialization for each layer and modify the\nloss function to ensure orthogonality of the weights during training. Moreover,\nwe show that activation functions can potentially increase correlation. To\nsolve this problem, we apply modified Batch-Normalization with Dropout. Using\northogonal weight matrices allow us to consider such neural networks as an\napplication of the Random Projection method and get a lower bound estimate for\nthe size of the last hidden layer. We perform experiments on MNIST and physical\nexamination datasets. In both experiments, initially, we split a set of labels\ninto two disjoint subsets to train a neural network for binary classification\nproblem, and then use this model to measure similarity between input data and\ndefine hidden classes. Our experimental results show that the proposed approach\nachieves competitive results on the input similarity task while reducing both\ncomputation time and the size of the input representation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Oct 2020 13:20:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-12"}

They model, however, only pairwise relations between nodes\nand are not designed for encoding the higher-order relations found in many\nreal-world datasets. To model such complex relations, hypergraphs have proven\nto be a natural representation. Learning the node representations in a\nhypergraph is more complex than in a graph as it involves information\npropagation at two levels: within every hyperedge and across the hyperedges.\nMost current approaches first transform a hypergraph structure to a graph for\nuse in existing geometric deep learning algorithms. This transformation leads\nto information loss, and sub-optimal exploitation of the hypergraph's\nexpressive power. We present HyperSAGE, a novel hypergraph learning framework\nthat uses a two-level neural message passing strategy to accurately and\nefficiently propagate information through hypergraphs. The flexible design of\nHyperSAGE facilitates different ways of aggregating neighborhood information.\nUnlike the majority of related work which is transductive, our approach,\ninspired by the popular GraphSAGE method, is inductive. Thus, it can also be\nused on previously unseen nodes, facilitating deployment in problems such as\nevolving or partially observed hypergraphs. Through extensive experimentation,\nwe show that HyperSAGE outperforms state-of-the-art hypergraph learning methods\non representative benchmark datasets. We also demonstrate that the higher\nexpressive power of HyperSAGE makes it more stable in learning node\nrepresentations as compared to the alternatives.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Oct 2020 13:28:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-12"}

The\neccentricity, rotation, and obliquity of the planets of TRAPPIST-1 are indeed\nthe result of tidal evolution over the lifetime of the system. Tidal\ninteractions can also lead to tidal heating in the interior of the planets,\nwhich can then be responsible for volcanism and/or surface deformation. In the\nmajority of studies to estimate the rotation of close-in planets or their tidal\nheating, the planets are considered as homogeneous bodies and their rheology is\noften taken to be a Maxwell rheology.\n  We investigate here the impact of considering a multi-layer structure and an\nAndrade rheology on the way planets dissipate tidal energy as a function of the\nexcitation frequency. We use an internal structure model, which provides the\nradial profile of structural and rheological quantities to compute the tidal\nresponse of multi-layer bodies. We then compare the outcome to the dissipation\nof a homogeneous planet.\n  We find that for purely rocky bodies, it is possible to approximate the\nresponse of a multi-layer planet by that of a homogeneous planet. However,\nusing average profiles of shear modulus and viscosity to compute the\nhomogeneous planet response leads to an overestimation of the averaged\ndissipation. We provide fitted values of shear modulus and viscosity to be able\nto reproduce the response of various types of rocky planets. However, we find\nthat if the planet has an icy layer, its tidal response can no longer be\napproximated by a homogeneous body because of the very different properties of\nthe icy layers, which lead to a second dissipation peak at higher frequencies.\nWe also compute the tidal heating profiles for the outer TRAPPIST-1 planets (e\nto h).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Oct 2020 14:13:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-04"}

In this paper, a physics-informed Gaussian process\nregression (PhI-GPR) method is presented and used for probabilistic forecasting\nand estimating the phase angle, angular speed, and wind mechanical power of a\nthree-generator power grid system using sparse measurements. In standard\ndata-driven Gaussian process regression (GPR), parameterized models for the\nprior statistics are fit by maximizing the marginal likelihood of observed\ndata, whereas in PhI-GPR, we compute the prior statistics by solving stochastic\nequations governing power grid dynamics. The short-term forecast of a power\ngrid system dominated by wind generation is complicated by the stochastic\nnature of the wind and the resulting uncertain mechanical wind power. Here, we\nassume that the power-grid dynamic is governed by the swing equations, and we\ntreat the unknown terms in the swing equations (specifically, the mechanical\nwind power) as random processes, which turns these equations into stochastic\ndifferential equations. We solve these equations for the mean and variance of\nthe power grid system using the Monte Carlo simulations method.

As refractory elements, the concentrations of Th and\nU in a terrestrial exoplanet are implicitly reflected in the photospheric\nabundances in the stellar host. However, a robust determination of these\nstellar abundances is difficult in practice owing to the general paucity and\nweakness of the relevant spectral features. We draw attention to the\nrefractory, $r-$process element europium, which may be used as a convenient and\npractical proxy for the population analysis of radiogenic heating in\nexoplanetary systems. As a case study, we present a determination of Eu\nabundances in the photospheres of $\\alpha$ Cen A and B. We find that europium\nis depleted with respect to iron by $\\sim$ 0.1 dex and to silicon by $\\sim$\n0.15 dex compared to solar in both binary components. To first order, the\nmeasured Eu abundances can be converted to the abundances of $^{232}$Th,\n$^{235}$U and $^{238}$U with observational constraints while the abundance of\n$^{40}$K is approximated independently with a Galactic chemical evolution\nmodel.

One\nof the critical factors affecting the performance of such materials is the\ncontribution to the heat flux of the exothermic recombination reactions at the\nvehicle surface. The main objective of this work is to develop a dedicated\nBayesian framework that allows us to compare uncertain measurements with model\npredictions which depend on the catalytic parameter values. Our framework\naccounts for uncertainties involved in the model definition and incorporates\nall measured variables with their respective uncertainties. The physical model\nused for the estimation consists of a 1D boundary layer solver along the\nstagnation line. The chemical production term included in the surface mass\nbalance depends on the catalytic recombination efficiency. As not all the\ndifferent quantities needed to simulate a reacting boundary layer can be\nmeasured or known (such as the flow enthalpy at the inlet boundary), we propose\nan optimization procedure built on the construction of the likelihood function\nto determine their most likely values based on the available experimental data.\nThis procedure avoids the need to introduce any a priori estimates on the\nnuisance quantities, namely, the boundary layer edge enthalpy, wall\ntemperatures, static and dynamic pressures, which would entail the use of very\nwide priors. We substitute the optimal likelihood of the experimental data with\na surrogate model to make the inference procedure both faster and more robust.\nWe show that the resulting Bayesian formulation yields meaningful and accurate\nposterior distributions of the catalytic parameters with a reduction of more\nthan 20% of the standard deviation with respect to previous works. We also\nstudy the implications of an extension of the experimental procedure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Oct 2020 15:49:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-07"}

The variability of input dimensions brings a severe problem to\nefficient memory management and serving optimization.\n  This paper designed a transformer serving system called TurboTransformers,\nwhich consists of a computing runtime and a serving framework to solve the\nabove challenges. Three innovative features make it stand out from other\nsimilar works. An efficient parallel algorithm is proposed for GPU-based batch\nreduction operations, like Softmax and LayerNorm, major hot spots besides BLAS\nroutines. A memory allocation algorithm, which better balances the memory\nfootprint and allocation/free efficiency, is designed for variable-length input\nsituations. A serving framework equipped with a new batch scheduler using\ndynamic programming achieves the optimal throughput on variable-length\nrequests. The system can achieve the state-of-the-art transformer model serving\nperformance on GPU platforms and can be seamlessly integrated into your PyTorch\ncode with a few lines of code.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Oct 2020 07:28:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2020 12:30:31 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 3 Jan 2021 12:33:49 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 20 Feb 2021 08:54:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-23"}

Sample matrix inversion problem is\ngenerally ill conditioned. Moreover, the contamination of the empirical\ncovariance matrix by the useful signal leads to significant degradation of\nperformance of this class of adaptive algorithms. Regularization, also known in\nradar literature as sample covariance loading, can be used to combat both ill\nconditioning of the original problem and contamination of the empirical\ncovariance by the desired signal. However, the optimum value of loading factor\ncannot be derived unless strong assumptions are made regarding the structure of\ncovariance matrix and useful signal penetration model. In this paper an\niterative algorithm for loading factor optimization based on the maximization\nof empirical signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) is proposed. The\nproposed solution does not rely on any assumptions regarding the structure of\nempirical covariance matrix and signal penetration model. The paper also\npresents simulation examples showing the effectiveness of the proposed\nsolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Oct 2020 14:04:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-15"}

To test the limits of this idea, a critical testbed is mobility of\ncatalytically active enzymes. Sentiment is divided about reality of enhanced\nenzyme diffusion with evidence for and against. Here a master curve shows that\nenzyme diffusion coefficient increases in proportion to the energy release\nrate, the product of Michaelis-Menten reaction rate and Gibbs free energy\nchange with the highly satisfactory correlation coefficient of 0.97. For ten\ncatalytic enzymes (urease, acetylcholinesterase, seven enzymes from the glucose\ncascade cycle, and another), our measurements span from roughly 40% enhanced\ndiffusion coefficient at high turnover rate and negative Gibbs free energy to\nno enhancement at slow turnover rate and positive Gibbs free energy. Moreover,\ntwo independent measures of mobility show consistency, provided that one avoids\nundesirable fluorescence photophysics. The master curve presented here\nquantifies the limits of both ideas, that enzymes display enhanced diffusion\nand that they do not within instrumental resolution, and has possible\nimplications for understanding enzyme mobility in cellular environments. The\nstriking linear dependence for the exergonic enzymes (negative Gibbs free\nenergy) together with the vanishing effect for endergonic enzyme (positive\nGibbs free energy) are consistent with a physical picture where the mechanism\nboosting the diffusion is an active one, utilizing the available work from the\nchemical reaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Oct 2020 05:11:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-08"}

Driving behavior\nand school zone safety is a public health concern. The sequence of\ninstantaneous driving decisions and its variations prior to involvement in\nsafety critical events, defined as driving volatility, can be a leading\nindicator of safety. By harnessing unique naturalistic data on more than 41,000\nnormal, crash, and near-crash events featuring over 9.4 million temporal\nsamples of real-world driving, a characterization of volatility in microscopic\ndriving decisions is sought at school and non-school zone locations.
