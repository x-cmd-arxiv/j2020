VoxMovies contains utterances with varying emotion, accents and\nbackground noise, and therefore comprises an entirely different domain to the\ninterview-style, emotionally calm utterances in current speaker recognition\ndatasets such as VoxCeleb; (ii) We provide a number of domain adaptation\nevaluation sets, and benchmark the performance of state-of-the-art speaker\nrecognition models on these evaluation pairs.

The gamma-ray radiation arise from\nrelativistic electrons that escape the pulsar wind nebula and diffuse in the\nsurrounding medium. The diffusion coefficient is found to be significantly\nlower than the average value in the Galactic disk. If so, given a typical\ntransverse velocity of $300-500{\\,\\rm km /s}$ for a pulsar, its displacement\ncould be important in shaping the morphology of its gamma-ray halos. Motivated\nby this, we study the morphology of pulsar halos considering the proper motion\nof pulsar. We define three evolutionary phases of pulsar halo to categorize its\nmorphological features. The morphology of pulsar halos below 10$\\,$TeV is\ndouble peaked or single peaked with an extended tail, which depends on the\nelectron injection history. Above 10 TeV, the morphology of pulsar halos is\nnearly spherical, due to the short cooling timescale ($<50\\,$kyr) for tens TeV\nelectrons. We also quantitatively evaluate the separation between the pulsar\nand the center of the gamma-ray halo, as well as the influence of different\nassumptions for the pulsar characteristics and the injected electrons. Our\nresults suggest that the separation between the center of the gamma-ray halo\nabove 10$\\,$TeV and the associated pulsar is usually too small to be observable\nby HAWC or LHAASO. Hence, our results provide a useful approach to constrain\nthe origin of extended sources at very high energies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Oct 2020 16:28:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Sep 2021 08:55:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-08"}

Secondly, we use mediation analysis to obtain\nan optimization target. By minimizing this target, we define the causal\nvariables.

An impressive\nability of the brain is its adaptive intelligence, which allows the brain to\nregulate its functions \"on the fly\" to cope with myriad and ever-changing\nsituations. In particular, the brain displays three adaptive and advanced\nintelligence abilities of context-awareness, cross frequency coupling and\nfeature binding. To mimic these adaptive cognitive abilities, we design and\nsimulate a novel, hardware-based adaptive oscillatory neuron using a lattice of\nmagnetic skyrmions. Charge current fed to the neuron reconfigures the skyrmion\nlattice, thereby modulating the neuron's state, its dynamics and its transfer\nfunction \"on the fly\". This adaptive neuron is used to demonstrate the three\ncognitive abilities, of which context-awareness and cross-frequency coupling\nhave not been previously realized in hardware neurons. Additionally, the neuron\nis used to construct an adaptive artificial neural network (ANN) and perform\ncontext-aware diagnosis of breast cancer.

Such an averaging process can be always represented as\naveraging with respect to a finite number of elements of the group, called a\nfinite averaging set. In the previous research such sets, known as $t$-designs,\nwere constructed only for the case of averaging over unitary groups (hence the\nname unitary $t$-designs). In this work we investigate the problem of\nconstructing finite averaging sets for averaging over general non-compact\nmatrix Lie groups, which is much more subtle task due to the fact that the the\nuniform invariant measure on the group manifold (the Haar measure) is infinite.\nWe provide a general construction of such sets based on the Cartan\ndecomposition of the group, which splits the group into its compact and\nnon-compact components. The averaging over the compact part can be done in a\nuniform way, whereas the averaging over the non-compact one has to be endowed\nwith a suppresing weight function, and can be approached using generalised\nGauss quadratures. This leads us to the general form of finite averaging sets\nfor semisimple matrix Lie groups in the product form of finite averaging sets\nwith respect to the compact and non-compact parts. We provide an explicit\ncalculation of such sets for the group $SL(2, \\mathbb{C})$, although our\nconstruction can be applied to other cases. Possible applications of our\nresults cover finding finite ensambles of random operations in quantum\ninformation science and quantum optics, which can be used in constructions of\nrandomised quantum algorithms, including optical interferometric\nimplementations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Oct 2020 17:26:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2020 11:31:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 9 Apr 2021 10:25:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-07"}

The quickest\nattack detection problem for a known {\\em linear} attack scheme in the Bayesian\nsetting with a Geometric prior on the attack initiation instant is posed as a\nconstrained Markov decision process (MDP), in order to minimize the expected\ndetection delay subject to a false alarm constraint, with the state involving\nthe probability belief at the estimator that the system is under attack.

However, they either are\nvulnerable to ambiguity attacks, or require changes in the target network\nstructure by replacing its original normalization layers and hence cause\nsignificant performance drops. To this end, we propose a new passport-aware\nnormalization formulation, which is generally applicable to most existing\nnormalization layers and only needs to add another passport-aware branch for IP\nprotection.

The other description adopts a\nmanifestly unitary, or holographic, description, in which the interior emerges\neffectively as a collective phenomenon of fundamental degrees of freedom.\n  In this paper we study the latter approach, which we refer to as the unitary\ngauge construction. In this picture, the formation of a black hole is signaled\nby the emergence of a surface (stretched horizon) possessing special dynamical\nproperties: quantum chaos, fast scrambling, and low energy universality. These\nproperties allow for constructing interior operators, as we do explicitly,\nwithout relying on details of microscopic physics. A key role is played by\ncertain coarse modes in the zone region (hard modes), which determine the\ndegrees of freedom relevant for the emergence of the interior.\n  We study how the interior operators can or cannot be extended in the space of\nmicrostates and analyze irreducible errors associated with such extension.

We provide an explicit prescription of\ncalculating interior correlators in the effective theory, which describes only\na finite region of spacetime.

While these different representations usually drive the frameworks\nto perform well in different aspects, e.g., better classification or finer\nlocalization, it is in general difficult to combine these representations in a\nsingle framework to make good use of each strength, due to the heterogeneous or\nnon-grid feature extraction by different representations. This paper presents\nan attention-based decoder module similar as that in\nTransformer~\\cite{vaswani2017attention} to bridge other representations into a\ntypical object detector built on a single representation format, in an\nend-to-end fashion. The other representations act as a set of \\emph{key}\ninstances to strengthen the main \\emph{query} representation features in the\nvanilla detectors.

Diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) is the most promising mechanism\nto accelerate Galactic cosmic rays (CRs) in the shocks of supernova remnants\n(SNRs). The turbulence upstream is supposedly generated by the CRs, but this\nprocess is not well understood. The dominant mechanism may depend on the\nevolutionary state of the shock and can be studied via the CRs escaping\nupstream into the interstellar medium (ISM). Aims. Previous observations of the\n$\\gamma$-Cygni SNR showed a difference in morphology between GeV and TeV\nenergies. Since this SNR has the right age and is at the evolutionary stage for\na significant fraction of CRs to escape, we aim to understand $\\gamma$-ray\nemission in the vicinity of the $\\gamma$-Cygni SNR. Methods. We observed the\nregion of the $\\gamma$-Cygni SNR with the MAGIC Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov\ntelescopes between May 2015 and September 2017 recording 87 h of good-quality\ndata. Additionally we analysed Fermi-LAT data to study the energy dependence of\nthe morphology as well as the energy spectrum in the GeV to TeV range. The\nenergy spectra and morphology were compared against theoretical predictions,\nwhich include a detailed derivation of the CR escape process and their\n$\\gamma$-ray generation. Results. The MAGIC and Fermi-LAT data allowed us to\nidentify three emission regions, which can be associated with the SNR and\ndominate at different energies. Our hadronic emission model accounts well for\nthe morphology and energy spectrum of all source components.

First, they follow a one-size-fits-all approach offering\nonly a single enclave type, however, different services need flexible enclaves\nthat can adjust to their demands.

The\npotential of new on-demand mobility options, such as ridesourcing services, to\nfill unpredicted gaps in mobility is an underexplored source of adaptive\ncapacity. Applying a natural experiment approach to newly released ridesourcing\ndata, we examine variation in the gap-filling role of on-demand mobility during\nsudden shocks to a transportation system by analyzing the change in use of\nridesourcing during unexpected rail transit service disruptions across the\nracially and economically diverse city of Chicago. Using a multilevel mixed\nmodel, we control not only for the immediate station attributes where the\ndisruption occurs, but also for the broader context of the community area and\ncity quadrant in a three-level structure. Thereby the unobserved variability\nacross neighborhoods can be associated with differences in factors such as\ntransit ridership, or socio-economic status of residents, in addition to\ncontrolling for station level effects. Our findings reveal that individuals use\nridesourcing as a gap-filling mechanism during rail transit disruptions, but\nthere is strong variation across situational and locational contexts.\nSpecifically, our results show larger increases in transit disruption\nresponsive ridesourcing during weekdays, nonholidays, and more severe\ndisruptions, as well as in community areas that have higher percentages of\nWhite residents and transit commuters, and on the more affluent northside of\nthe city. These findings point to new insights with far-reaching implications\non how ridesourcing complements existing transport networks by providing added\ncapacity during disruptions but does not appear to bring equitable gap-filling\nbenefits to low-income communities of color that typically have more limited\nmobility options.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Oct 2020 19:06:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-02"}

Recent works have claimed that Gaussian\nprocess regression (GPR) can robustly perform this separation, particularly at\nlow Fourier $k$ wavenumbers where the signal reaches its peak signal-to-noise\nratio. We revisit this topic by casting GPR foreground subtraction (GPR-FS)\ninto the quadratic estimator formalism, thereby putting its statistical\nproperties on stronger theoretical footing. We find that GPR-FS can distort the\nwindow functions at these low k modes, which, without proper decorrelation,\nmake it difficult to probe the EoR power spectrum. Incidentally, we also show\nthat GPR-FS is in fact closely related to the widely studied optimal quadratic\nestimator.

A\ncommon problem that arises in applications is that of constructing smooth\napproximants to these vector fields and/or their potentials based only on\ndiscrete samples. Additionally, it is often necessary that the vector\napproximants preserve the div-free or curl-free properties of the field to\nmaintain certain physical constraints. Div/curl-free radial basis functions\n(RBFs) are a particularly good choice for this application as they are meshfree\nand analytically satisfy the div-free or curl-free property. However, this\nmethod can be computationally expensive due to its global nature. In this\npaper, we develop a technique for bypassing this issue that combines\ndiv/curl-free RBFs in a partition of unity framework, where one solves for\nlocal approximants over subsets of the global samples and then blends them\ntogether to form a div-free or curl-free global approximant. The method is\napplicable to div/curl-free vector fields in $\\R^2$ and tangential fields on\ntwo-dimensional surfaces, such as the sphere, and the curl-free method can be\ngeneralized to vector fields in $\\R^d$.

It consists in spreading rigid fibers in the\nflow and tracking their position and orientation in time and therefore been\nnamed ``Fiber Tracking Velocimetry'' (FTV). By choosing different fiber\nlengths, i.e. within the inertial or dissipative range of scales, the\nstatistics of turbulence fluctuations at the selected lengthscale can be probed\naccurately by simply measuring the fiber velocity at its two ends, and\nprojecting it along the transverse-to-the-fiber direction. By means of\nfully-resolved direct numerical simulations and experiments, we show that these\nfiber-based transverse velocity increments are statistically equivalent to the\n(unperturbed) flow transverse velocity increments. Moreover, we show that the\nturbulent energy dissipation rate can be accurately measured exploiting\nsufficiently short fibers. The technique has been tested against standard\nParticle Tracking Velocimetry (PTV) of flow tracers with excellent agreement.\nOur technique overcomes the well-known problem of PTV to probe two-point\nstatistics reliably because of the fast relative diffusion in turbulence that\nprevents the mutual distance between particles to remain constant at the\nlengthscale of interest. This problem, making it difficult to obtain converged\nstatistics for a fixed separation distance, is even more dramatic for natural\nflows in open domains. A prominent example are oceanic currents, where drifters\n(i.e.~the tracer-particle counterpart used in field measurements) disperse\nquickly, but at the same time their number has to be limited to save costs.\nInspired by our laboratory experiments, we propose pairs of connected drifters\nas a viable option to solve the issue.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Oct 2020 19:58:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Nov 2020 08:26:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 13 Jul 2021 10:12:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-22"}

When external\npharmacies are utilized, a courier service is needed to deliver the individual\ntherapies from the pharmacy to the oncology department. An oncology department\nlocated in southern Italy was studied through the simulation model and\ndifferent scenarios were compared with the aim of selecting the department\nconfiguration capable of reducing the patient waiting times.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Oct 2020 20:11:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Feb 2021 12:05:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 4 Jun 2021 12:38:11 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 31 Jan 2022 10:32:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-01"}

Our results are\nobtained with the Keldysh non-equilibrium Green's functions technique, using\nthe full spectrum of the Kitaev chain without resorting to minimal models. A\nclosed formula for the linear conductance is given, and the analytical\nprocedure to obtain the differential conductance for the transport mediated by\nhigher excitations is described. The linear conductance attains the maximum\nvalue of $e^2/h$ only for the exact zero energy states. Also the differential\nconductance exhibits a complex pattern created by numerous crossings and\nanticrossings in the excitation spectrum. We reveal the crossings to be\nprotected by the inversion symmetry, while the anticrossings result from a\npairing-induced hybridization of particle-like and hole-like solutions with the\nsame inversion character. Our comprehensive treatment of the Kitaev chain\nallows us also to identify the contributions of both local and non-local\ntransmission processes to transport at arbitrary bias voltage. Local Andreev\nreflection processes dominate the transport within the bulk gap and diminish\nfor higher excited states, but reemerge when the bias voltage probes the\navoided crossings.

After each\ntransmission, the encoder is notified about the insertions or deletions that\nhave occurred within the previous transmission and the encoding strategy can be\nadapted accordingly. The goal is to design an encoder that is able to transmit\nerror-free as much information as possible under the assumption that the total\nnumber of deletions and insertions is limited by $\\tau n$, $0<\\tau<1$. We show\nhow this problem can be reduced to the problem of transmitting messages over\nthe substitution channel.

Layered\nRuddlesden-Popper perovskites of the form BA2MAn-1PbnI3n+1, where n is the\nnumber of lead-halide and methylammonium (MA) sheets spaced by longer\nbutylammonium (BA) cations, are particularly interesting due to their unique\ntwo-dimensional character and charge carrier dynamics dominated by strongly\nbound excitons. However, long-range energy transport through exciton diffusion\nin these materials is not understood or realised. Here, we employ local\ntime-resolved luminescence mapping techniques to visualise exciton transport in\nhigh-quality exfoliated flakes of the BA2MAn-1PbnI3n+1 perovskite family. We\nuncover two distinct transport regimes, depending on the temperature range\nstudied. At temperatures above 100 K, diffusion is mediated by thermally\nactivated hopping processes between localised states. At lower temperatures, a\nnon-uniform energetic landscape emerges in which exciton transport is dominated\nby energy funnelling processes to lower energy states, leading to long range\ntransport over hundreds of nanometres even in the absence of exciton-phonon\ncoupling and in the presence of local optoelectronic heterogeneity. Efficient,\nlong-range and switchable excitonic funnelling offers exciting possibilities of\ncontrolled directional long-range transport in these 2D materials for new\ndevice applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Oct 2020 20:43:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-02"}

A two-stage approach is adopted, in which linear\ncommunication channel is equalized at the first stage, and it is followed by a\npost-distortion where nonlinear distortion is reduced. In literature, nonlinear\nprocessing techniques are proposed, which performs memoryless compensation of\nnonlinear distortion together with FDE.

Two different post-distortion techniques,\nGaussian process regression (GPR) and neural network (NN) based\npost-distorters, are considered.

It has numerous applications including automatic detection of\ncross-site scripting (XSS). A popular string analysis technique includes\nsymbolic executions, which at their core use string (constraint) solvers. Such\nsolvers typically reason about constraints expressed in theories over strings\nwith the concatenation operator as an atomic constraint. In recent years,\nresearchers started to recognise the importance of incorporating the\nreplace-all operator and finite transductions in the theories of strings with\nconcatenation. Such string operations are typically crucial for reasoning about\nXSS vulnerabilities in web applications, especially for modelling sanitisation\nfunctions and implicit browser transductions (e.g. innerHTML).\n  In this paper, we provide the first string solver that can reason about\nconstraints involving both concatenation and finite transductions. Moreover, it\nhas a completeness and termination guarantee for several important fragments\n(e.g. straight-line fragment). The main challenge addressed in the paper is the\nprohibitive worst-case complexity of the theory. To this end, we propose a\nmethod that exploits succinct alternating finite automata as concise symbolic\nrepresentations of string constraints. Alternation offers not only exponential\nsavings in space when representing Boolean combinations of transducers, but\nalso a possibility of succinct representation of otherwise costly combinations\nof transducers and concatenation. Reasoning about the emptiness of the AFA\nlanguage requires a state-space exploration in an exponential-sized graph, for\nwhich we use model checking algorithms (e.g. IC3).

As smells are surface indicators of a deeper\nproblem in software, determining the relationship between smells and software\nvulnerabilities can play a significant role in vulnerability prediction models.\nObjective: This study explores the relationship between smells and software\nvulnerabilities to identify the smells.

It significantly hurts model performance on tail items. To improve\ntail-item recommendation, we conduct research to transfer knowledge from head\nitems to tail items, leveraging the rich user feedback in head items and the\nsemantic connections between head and tail items. Specifically, we propose a\nnovel dual transfer learning framework that jointly learns the knowledge\ntransfer from both model-level and item-level: 1. The model-level knowledge\ntransfer builds a generic meta-mapping of model parameters from few-shot to\nmany-shot model. It captures the implicit data augmentation on the model-level\nto improve the representation learning of tail items. 2. The item-level\ntransfer connects head and tail items through item-level features, to ensure a\nsmooth transfer of meta-mapping from head items to tail items. The two types of\ntransfers are incorporated to ensure the learned knowledge from head items can\nbe well applied for tail item representation learning in the long-tail\ndistribution settings. Through extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets,\nresults show that our proposed dual transfer learning framework significantly\noutperforms other state-of-the-art methods for tail item recommendation in hit\nratio and NDCG.

In contrast, we are studying ballistic-reversible gates, where\nfluxons serve to both encode the information and power the gates. No power is\napplied to the gate apart from the energy of the input fluxons, and the two\npossible flux polarities represent the bit states. Undamped long Josephson\njunctions (LJJs), where fluxons move at practically constant speed from\ninertia, form the input and output channels of the gates. LJJs are connected in\nthe gates by circuit interfaces, which are designed to allow the ballistic\nscattering from input to output fluxon states, using the temporary excitation\nof a localized mode. The duration of the resonant scattering determines the\noperation time of the gate, approximately a few Josephson plasma periods. Due\nto the coherent conversions between fluxon and localized modes the ballistic\ngates can be very efficient: in our simulations only a few percent of the\nfluxon's energy are dissipated in the gate operation. Ballistic-reversible\ngates can be combined with other, non-ballistic gate circuits to extend the\nrange of gate functionalities.

For instance, the\nmost prolific method for detecting exoplanets and inferring several of their\ncharacteristics, transit photometry, is very sensitive to the presence of\nstellar spots. The current practice in the literature is to identify the\neffects of spots visually and correct for them manually or discard the affected\ndata.

To tackle\nit, most existing methods focus on enhancing visual feature learning to reduce\nthis superficial textual shortcut influence on VQA model decisions. However,\nlimited effort has been devoted to providing an explicit interpretation for its\ninherent cause. It thus lacks a good guidance for the research community to\nmove forward in a purposeful way, resulting in model construction perplexity in\novercoming this non-trivial problem. In this paper, we propose to interpret the\nlanguage prior problem in VQA from a class-imbalance view. Concretely, we\ndesign a novel interpretation scheme whereby the loss of mis-predicted frequent\nand sparse answers of the same question type is distinctly exhibited during the\nlate training phase. It explicitly reveals why the VQA model tends to produce a\nfrequent yet obviously wrong answer, to a given question whose right answer is\nsparse in the training set. Based upon this observation, we further develop a\nnovel loss re-scaling approach to assign different weights to each answer based\non the training data statistics for computing the final loss. We apply our\napproach into three baselines and the experimental results on two VQA-CP\nbenchmark datasets evidently demonstrate its effectiveness. In addition, we\nalso justify the validity of the class imbalance interpretation scheme on other\ncomputer vision tasks, such as face recognition and image classification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2020 00:57:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 18 Sep 2021 06:57:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 10 Nov 2021 08:17:12 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 14 Dec 2021 16:18:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-15"}

We introduce Policy Optimization with Multiple\nOptima (POMO), an end-to-end approach for building such a heuristic solver.\nPOMO is applicable to a wide range of CO problems. It is designed to exploit\nthe symmetries in the representation of a CO solution. POMO uses a modified\nREINFORCE algorithm that forces diverse rollouts towards all optimal solutions.\nEmpirically, the low-variance baseline of POMO makes RL training fast and\nstable, and it is more resistant to local minima compared to previous\napproaches. We also introduce a new augmentation-based inference method, which\naccompanies POMO nicely. We demonstrate the effectiveness of POMO by solving\nthree popular NP-hard problems, namely, traveling salesman (TSP), capacitated\nvehicle routing (CVRP), and 0-1 knapsack (KP). For all three, our solver based\non POMO shows a significant improvement in performance over all recent learned\nheuristics.

For many\nsystems, however, the data we have access to is not a direct description of the\nunderlying network. More and more, we see the drive to study networks that have\nbeen inferred or reconstructed from non-network data---in particular, using\ntime series data from the nodes in a system to infer likely connections between\nthem. Selecting the most appropriate technique for this task is a challenging\nproblem in network science. Different reconstruction techniques usually have\ndifferent assumptions, and their performance varies from system to system in\nthe real world. One way around this problem could be to use several different\nreconstruction techniques and compare the resulting networks. However, network\ncomparison is also not an easy problem, as it is not obvious how best to\nquantify the differences between two networks, in part because of the diversity\nof tools for doing so. The netrd Python package seeks to address these two\nparallel problems in network science by providing, to our knowledge, the most\nextensive collection of both network reconstruction techniques and network\ncomparison techniques (often referred to as graph distances) in a single\nlibrary (https://github.com/netsiphd/netrd).

Computed tomography (CT) scans have shown\ndistinctive features and higher sensitivity compared to other diagnostic tests,\nin particular the current gold standard, i.e., the Reverse Transcription\nPolymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test. Current deep learning-based algorithms\nare mainly developed based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify\nCOVID-19 pneumonia cases. CNNs, however, require extensive data augmentation\nand large datasets to identify detailed spatial relations between image\ninstances. Furthermore, existing algorithms utilizing CT scans, either extend\nslice-level predictions to patient-level ones using a simple thresholding\nmechanism or rely on a sophisticated infection segmentation to identify the\ndisease. In this paper, we propose a two-stage fully-automated CT-based\nframework for identification of COVID-19 positive cases referred to as the\n\"COVID-FACT\". COVID-FACT utilizes Capsule Networks, as its main building blocks\nand is, therefore, capable of capturing spatial information.

Given any input image of a person or a group of persons with\nsome value indicating the desired change of skin color towards fairness or\ndarkness, this method can change the skin tone of the persons in the image.\nThis is an unsupervised method and also unconstrained in terms of pose,\nillumination, number of persons in the image etc. The goal of this work is to\nreduce the time and effort which is generally required for changing the skin\ntone using existing applications (e.g., Photoshop) by professionals or novice.\nTo establish the efficacy of this method we have compared our result with that\nof some popular photo editor and also with the result of some existing\nbenchmark method related to human attribute manipulation. Rigorous experiments\non different datasets show the effectiveness of this method in terms of\nsynthesizing perceptually convincing outputs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2020 06:27:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-02"}

A total of N sensors are available for making observations\nof the Markov chain, out of which a subset of sensors are activated each time\nin order to perform reliable estimation of the process. The trade-off is\nbetween activating more sensors to gather more observations for the remote\nestimation, and restricting sensor usage in order to save energy and bandwidth\nconsumption. The problem is formulated as a constrained minimization problem,\nwhere the objective is the long-run averaged mean-squared error (MSE) in\nestimation, and the constraint is on sensor activation rate. A Lagrangian\nrelaxation of the problem is solved by an artful blending of two tools: Gibbs\nsampling for MSE minimization and an on-line version of expectation\nmaximization (EM) to estimate the unknown TPM. Finally, the Lagrange multiplier\nis updated using slower timescale stochastic approximation in order to satisfy\nthe sensor activation rate constraint. The on-line EM algorithm, though adapted\nfrom literature, can estimate vector-valued parameters even under time-varying\ndimension of the sensor observations. Numerical results demonstrate\napproximately 1 dB better error performance than uniform sensor sampling and\ncomparable error performance (within 2 dB bound) against complete sensor\nobservation.

We know that GNN\nis designed to learn single-node representations. When we want to learn a node\nset representation involving multiple nodes, a common practice in previous\nworks is to directly aggregate the single-node representations obtained by a\nGNN into a joint node set representation. In this paper, we show a fundamental\nconstraint of such an approach, namely the inability to capture the dependence\nbetween nodes in the node set, and argue that directly aggregating individual\nnode representations does not lead to an effective joint representation for\nmultiple nodes. Then, we notice that a few previous successful works for\nmulti-node representation learning, including SEAL, Distance Encoding, and\nID-GNN, all used node labeling. These methods first label nodes in the graph\naccording to their relationships with the target node set before applying a\nGNN. Then, the node representations obtained in the labeled graph are\naggregated into a node set representation. By investigating their inner\nmechanisms, we unify these node labeling techniques into a single and most\ngeneral form -- labeling trick. We prove that with labeling trick a\nsufficiently expressive GNN learns the most expressive node set\nrepresentations, thus in principle solves any joint learning tasks over node\nsets.

Most frequently, these states are studied\nwithin the framework of phase approximation. The latter is used ubiquitously to\nanalyze coupled oscillatory systems. Typically, the phase dynamics description\nis obtained in the weak coupling limit, i.e., in the first-order in the\ncoupling strength. The extension beyond the first-order represents an unsolved\nproblem and is an active area of research. In this paper, three partially\nsynchronous states are investigated and presented in order of increasing\ncomplexity. First, the usage of the phase response curve for the description of\nmacroscopic oscillators is analyzed. To achieve this, the response of the\nmean-field oscillations in a model of all-to-all coupled limit-cycle\noscillators to pulse stimulation is measured. The next part treats a two-group\nKuramoto model, where the interaction of one attractive and one repulsive group\nresults in an interesting solitary state, situated between full synchrony and\nself-consistent partial synchrony. In the last part, the phase dynamics of a\nrelatively simple system of three Stuart-Landau oscillators are extended beyond\nthe weak coupling limit. The resulting model contains triplet terms in the\nhigh-order phase approximation, though the structural connections are only\npairwise. Finally, the scaling of the new terms with the coupling is analyzed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2020 07:30:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Dec 2020 14:29:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-30"}

When grinded below\none micrometre, the four materials studied (olivine, smectite, pyroxene and\namorphous silica), show strong decrease of their absorption features together\nwith a blueing of the spectra.

These two effects, decrease of band depth and spectral\nblueing, appear magnified when the grains are incorporated in the hyperporous\nresidue. We interpret the distinct behaviour between hyperporous and more\ncompact surfaces by the distancing of individual grains and a decrease in the\nsize of the elemental scatterers.

A key problem with this approach is that the resulting deep\nspeaker vectors tend to be irregularly distributed. In previous research, we\nproposed a deep normalization approach based on a new discriminative\nnormalization flow (DNF) model, by which the distributions of individual\nspeakers are arguably transformed to homogeneous Gaussians. This normalization\nwas demonstrated to be effective, but despite this remarkable success, we\nempirically found that the latent codes produced by the DNF model are generally\nneither homogeneous nor Gaussian, although the model has assumed so. In this\npaper, we argue that this problem is largely attributed to the\nmaximum-likelihood (ML) training criterion of the DNF model, which aims to\nmaximize the likelihood of the observations but not necessarily improve the\nGaussianality of the latent codes. We therefore propose a new Maximum\nGaussianality (MG) training approach that directly maximizes the Gaussianality\nof the latent codes. Our experiments on two data sets, SITW and CNCeleb,\ndemonstrate that our new MG training approach can deliver much better\nperformance than the previous ML training, and exhibits improved domain\ngeneralizability, particularly with regard to cosine scoring.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2020 09:42:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-02"}

Crowdsourcing-based approaches\nare generally adopted, where customers are directly asked to answer surveys\nabout their user experience. Since the number of collaborative users is\ngenerally low, network operators rely on Machine Learning models to predict the\nsatisfaction levels/QoE of the users rather than directly measuring it through\nsurveys. Finally, combining the true/predicted user satisfaction levels with\ninformation on each user mobility (e.g, which network sites each user has\nvisited and for how long), an operator may reveal critical areas in the\nnetworks and drive/prioritize investments properly.

In droop-controlled microgrids,\nthe voltage volatility induced by renewable uncertainties is aggravated by the\nhigh droop gains. This paper proposes a chance-constrained optimal power flow\n(CC-OPF) problem with power flow routers (PFRs) to better regulate the voltage\nprofile in microgrids. PFR refer to a general type of network-side controller\nthat brings more flexibility to the power network. Comparing with the normal\nCC-OPF that relies on power injection flexibility only, the proposed model\nintroduces a new dimension of control from power network to enhance system\nperformance under renewable uncertainties. Since the inclusion of PFRs\ncomplicates the problem and makes common solvers no longer apply directly, we\ndesign an iterative solution algorithm. For the subproblem in each iteration,\nchance constraints are transformed into equivalent deterministic ones via\nsensitivity analysis, so that the subproblem can be efficiently solved by the\nconvex relaxation method. The proposed method is verified on the modified IEEE\n33-bus system and the results show that PFRs make a significant contribution to\nmitigating the voltage volatility and make the system operate in a more\neconomic and secure way.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2020 10:28:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-02"}

The goal in this setting is to optimize both the\nround and message complexities incurred per update step, ideally achieving a\nmessage complexity that matches the centralized update time in $O(1)$ (perhaps\namortized) rounds.\n  Toward initiating a systematic study of dynamic, distributed algorithms, we\nstudy some of the most central symmetry-breaking problems: maximal independent\nset (MIS), maximal matching/(approx-) maximum cardinality matching (MM/MCM),\nand $(\\Delta + 1)$-vertex coloring.

Our understanding\nof atmospheric escape and chemistry, therefore, depends on our knowledge of the\nstellar UV fluxes.

A new method, called optimization algorithm-based approach (OABA),\nis proposed to predict the large deflection of cantilever beams, in which an\noptimization algorithm is exploited to find the locus of the beam tip. With the\nderived locus of the beam tip, the deflection curve of the cantilever beam can\nbe calculated.

Experimental results show that the\nproposed method can precisely predict the deflection of the uniform and\nnon-uniform cantilever beams.

It employs two segmentation neural networks. The first network is used\nto segment the anatomical structures such as the myocardium and left\nventricular cavity. The second network is used to segment the pathological\nareas such as myocardial infarction, myocardial no-reflow, and normal\nmyocardial region. The segmented myocardium region from the first network is\nfurther used to refine the second network's pathological segmentation results.\nThe second task is to automatically classify a given case into normal or\npathological from clinical information with or without DE-MRI.

The segmented pathological areas from DE-MRI\nare also used for the classification task. We evaluated our method on the 2020\nEMIDEC MICCAI challenge dataset.

Vehicles share their phase angles through the V2X\ninfrastructure, and synchronize these angles using the Kuramoto equation.

On top of that, in order to deliver science ready data products,\nsoftware pipelines are needed for radio frequency interference (RFI)\nmitigation, averaging, calibration and imaging. Here, we focus on the SAGECal\ncalibration package, in particular on the times needed to obtain calibration\nsolutions. This is an important aspect, since this package is now used for the\nEpoch of Reionization (EoR) Key Science Project of LOFAR, but will also have to\nrun optimally on SKA1 LOW. In terms of number of stations used for observing\nthis amounts to a factor 10 increase, from 51 to 512 stations. Consequentially,\nthe disk space needed to store an observation will increase by a factor 100,\nprovided the number of frequency channels remains the same. In this paper we\ninvestigate the scaling behaviour of SAGECal, whose runtimes should ideally\nscale linearly with the number of stations. We also explain the algorithms\ninside SAGECal and use them to explain its scaling behaviour.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2020 11:48:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-02"}

Its\nmain goal is to keep the amplitude and phase at a given set-point. The LLRF\nsystem is also responsible for the reference clock distribution.\n  During machine operation the cavities are periodically experiencing strain\ncaused by the Lorentz force, appearing when the beam is passing through the\naccelerating structures. Even small changes of the physical dimensions of the\ncavity cause a shift of its resonance frequency. This phenomenon, called\ndetuning, causes significant power losses. It is actively compensated by the\nLLRF control system, which can physically tune lengths of the accelerating\ncavities with stepper motors (slow, coarse grained control) and piezoelements\n(active compensation during operation state).\n  The paper describes implementation and tests of the software supporting\nvarious aspects of the LLRF system and cavities management. The Piezo Driver\nmanagement and monitoring tool is dedicated for piezo controller device. The LO\nDistribution application is responsible for configuration of the local\noscillator.

As shown by recent studies into\nreduced-precision climate simulations, an application that can largely benefit\nfrom the advantages of low-precision computing is the numerical solution of\npartial differential equations (PDEs). However, a careful implementation and\nrounding error analysis are required to ensure that sensible results can still\nbe obtained.\n  In this paper we study the accumulation of rounding errors in the solution of\nthe heat equation, a proxy for parabolic PDEs, via Runge-Kutta finite\ndifference methods using round-to-nearest (RtN) and stochastic rounding (SR).\nWe demonstrate how to implement the scheme to reduce rounding errors and we\nderive \\emph{a priori} estimates for local and global rounding errors. Let $u$\nbe the unit roundoff. While the worst-case local errors are $O(u)$ with respect\nto the discretization parameters (mesh size and timestep), the RtN and SR error\nbehavior is substantially different. In fact, the RtN solution always stagnates\nfor small enough $\\Delta t$, and until stagnation the global error grows like\n$O(u\\Delta t^{-1})$. In contrast, we show that the leading-order errors\nintroduced by SR are zero-mean, independent in space and mean-independent in\ntime, making SR resilient to stagnation and rounding error accumulation. In\nfact, we prove that for SR the global rounding errors are only $O(u\\Delta\nt^{-1/4})$ in 1D and are essentially bounded (up to logarithmic factors) in\nhigher dimensions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2020 12:39:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 28 Mar 2022 21:05:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-10"}

Our result shows that instead of scaling linearly with the base station\n(BS) antenna number $M$, the SNR with the more generic spherical wavefront\nmodel increases with $M$ with diminishing return, governed by a new parameter\ncalled angular span. One important finding from our derivation is the necessity\nto introduce a new distance criterion, termed critical distance, to complement\nthe classical Rayleigh distance for separating the near- and far-field\npropagation regions. While Rayleigh distance is based on the phase difference\nacross array elements and hence depends on the electrical size of the antenna,\nthe critical distance cares about the amplitude/power difference and only\ndepends on its physical size. We then extend the study to the multi-user\nXL-MIMO communication system, for which we demonstrate that inter-user\ninterference (IUI) can be mitigated not just by angle separation, but also by\ndistance separation along the same direction.

To alleviate these\nbottlenecks, practitioners use gradient compression techniques like\nsparsification, quantization, or low-rank updates. The techniques usually\nrequire choosing a static compression ratio, often requiring users to balance\nthe trade-off between model accuracy and per-iteration speedup. In this work,\nwe show that such performance degradation due to choosing a high compression\nratio is not fundamental. An adaptive compression strategy can reduce\ncommunication while maintaining final test accuracy. Inspired by recent\nfindings on critical learning regimes, in which small gradient errors can have\nirrecoverable impact on model performance, we propose Accordion a simple yet\neffective adaptive compression algorithm. While Accordion maintains a high\nenough compression rate on average, it avoids over-compressing gradients\nwhenever in critical learning regimes, detected by a simple gradient-norm based\ncriterion. Our extensive experimental study over a number of machine learning\ntasks in distributed environments indicates that Accordion, maintains similar\nmodel accuracy to uncompressed training, yet achieves up to 5.5x better\ncompression and up to 4.1x end-to-end speedup over static approaches.

However, these models are not directly encouraged to capture\nrepresentations of intermediate-size structures that exist in natural languages\nsuch as sentences and the relationships among them. To that end, we propose a\nnew approach to encourage learning of a contextualized sentence-level\nrepresentation by shuffling the sequence of input sentences and training a\nhierarchical transformer model to reconstruct the original ordering.

To address this\nchallenge, we propose a model that maps RGB-D images to a set of 3D visual\nfeature maps in a differentiable fully-convolutional manner, supervised by\npredicting views.

Provided experimental setups corresponding to the sensitivity of\n$|m^{}_{\\beta\\beta}| \\simeq 1~{\\rm meV}$, the null observation of\n$0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decays in the case of normal neutrino mass ordering leads to a\nvery competitive bound on the lightest neutrino mass $m^{}_1$. Namely, the\n$95\\%$ credible interval turns out to be $1.6~{\\rm meV} \\lesssim m^{}_1\n\\lesssim 7.3~{\\rm meV}$ or $0.3~{\\rm meV} \\lesssim m^{}_1 \\lesssim 5.6~{\\rm\nmeV}$ when the uniform prior on $m^{}_1/{\\rm eV}$ or on\n$\\log^{}_{10}(m^{}_1/{\\rm eV})$ is adopted. Moreover, one of two Majorana CP\nphases is strictly constrained, i.e., $140^\\circ \\lesssim \\rho \\lesssim\n220^\\circ$ for both priors of $m^{}_1$. In contrast, if a relatively worse\nsensitivity of $|m^{}_{\\beta\\beta}| \\simeq 10~{\\rm meV}$ is assumed, the\nconstraint becomes accordingly $0.6~{\\rm meV} \\lesssim m^{}_1 \\lesssim 26~{\\rm\nmeV}$ or $0 \\lesssim m^{}_1 \\lesssim 6.1~{\\rm meV}$, while two Majorana CP\nphases will be essentially unconstrained. In the same statistical framework,\nthe prospects for the determination of neutrino mass ordering and the\ndiscrimination between Majorana and Dirac nature of massive neutrinos in the\n$0\\nu\\beta\\beta$-decay experiments are also discussed. Given the experimental\nsensitivity of $|m^{}_{\\beta\\beta}| \\simeq 10~{\\rm meV}$ (or $1~{\\rm meV}$),\nthe strength of evidence to exclude the Majorana nature under the null\nobservation of $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decays is found to be inconclusive (or strong),\nno matter which of two priors on $m^{}_1$ is taken.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2020 14:02:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 11 Mar 2021 02:35:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-12"}

To this end, we propose a method for learning reactive obstacle\navoidance policies. We evaluate our method on goal-reaching tasks for single\nand multiple obstacles scenarios. We show the ability of the proposed method to\nefficiently learn stable obstacle avoidance strategies at a high success rate,\nwhile maintaining closed-loop responsiveness required for critical applications\nlike human-robot interaction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2020 14:50:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-02"}

These systems exploit the actor\nmodel's isolation property to fulfill their performance and scalability\ndemands. Unfortunately, the reliance of the model on isolation as its most\nfundamental property requires programmers to express complex interaction\npatterns between their actors to be expressed manually in terms of complex\ncombinations of messages sent between the isolated actors.\n  Inquiry: In the last three decades, several language design proposals have\nbeen introduced to reduce the complexity that emerges from describing said\ninteraction and coordination of actors. We argue that none of these proposals\nis satisfactory in order to express the many complex interaction patterns\nbetween actors found in modern reactive distributed systems.\n  Approach: We describe seven smart home automation scenarios (in which an\nactor represents every smart home appliance) to motivate the support by actor\nlanguages for five radically different types of message synchronization\npatterns, which are lacking in modern distributed actor-based languages.\nFortunately, these five types of synchronisation patterns have been studied\nextensively by the Complex Event Processing (CEP) community. Our paper\ndescribes how such CEP patterns are elegantly added to an actor-based\nprogramming language.\n  Knowledge: Based on our findings, we propose an extension of the\nsingle-message matching paradigm of contemporary actor-based languages in order\nto support a multiple-message matching way of thinking in the same way as\nproposed by CEP languages. Our proposal thus enriches the actor-model by ways\nof declaratively describing complex message combinations to which an actor can\nrespond.\n  Grounding: We base the problem-statement of the paper on an online poll in\nthe home automation community that has motivated the real need for the\nCEP-based synchronisation operators between actors proposed in the paper.\nFurthermore, we implemented a DSL -- called Sparrow -- that supports said\noperators and we argue quantitatively (in terms of LOC and in terms of a\nreduction of the concerns that have to be handled by programmers) that the DSL\noutperforms existing approaches.\n  Importance: This work aims to provide a set of synchronization operators that\nhelp actor-based languages to handle the complex interaction required by modern\nreactive distributed systems. To the best of our knowledge, our proposal is the\nfirst one to add advanced CEP synchronization operators to the -- relatively\nsimplistic single-message based matching -- mechanisms of most actor-based\nlanguages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2020 14:53:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-02"}

The rationale behind this trend is that\ndifferent parts of an application can be offloaded from the main CPU to diverse\ndevices, which can efficiently execute these parts as co-processors. FPGAs are\na subset of the most widely used co-processors, typically used for accelerating\nspecific workloads due to their flexible hardware and energy-efficient\ncharacteristics. These characteristics have made them prevalent in a broad\nspectrum of computing systems ranging from low-power embedded systems to\nhigh-end data centers and cloud infrastructures.\n  However, these hardware characteristics come at the cost of programmability.\nDevelopers who create their applications using high-level programming languages\n(e.g., Java, Python, etc.) are required to familiarize with a hardware\ndescription language (e.g., VHDL, Verilog) or recently heterogeneous\nprogramming models (e.g., OpenCL, HLS) in order to exploit the co-processors?\ncapacity and tune the performance of their applications.

The growing use of formal methods in, and the\ngrowth of software synthesis, all create demand for techniques to train\nstudents and developers in the art of specification writing.

These constructs are called islands and the rest of the text is called\nwater, which the parser ignores and skips over. Since an island parser does not\nhave to parse all the details of the input, it is often easy to develop but\nstill useful enough for a number of software engineering tools. When a parser\ngenerator is used, the developer can implement an island parser by just\ndescribing a small number of grammar rules, for example, in Parsing Expression\nGrammar (PEG).\n  Inquiry: In practice, however, the grammar rules are often complicated since\nthe developer must define the water inside the island; otherwise, the island\nparsing will not reduce the total number of grammar rules. When describing the\ngrammar rules for such water, the developer must consider other rules and\nenumerate a set of symbols, which we call alternative symbols. Due to this\ndifficulty, island parsing seems to be not widely used today despite its\nusefulness in many applications.\n  Approach: This paper proposes the lake symbols for addressing this difficulty\nin developing an island parser. It also presents an extension to PEG for\nsupporting the lake symbols. The lake symbols automate the enumeration of the\nalternative symbols for the water inside an island. The paper proposes an\nalgorithm for translating the extended PEG to the normal PEG, which can be\ngiven to an existing parser generator based on PEG.\n  Knowledge: The user can use lake symbols to define water without specifying\neach alternative symbol. Our algorithms can calculate all alternative symbols\nfor a lake symbol, based on where the lake symbol is used in the grammar.\n  Grounding: We implemented a parser generator accepting our extended PEG and\nimplemented 36 island parsers for Java and 20 island parsers for Python. Our\nexperiments show that the lake symbols reduce 42 % of grammar rules for Java\nand 89 % of rules for Python on average, excluding the case where islands are\nexpressions.\n  Importance: This work eases the use of island parsing. Lake symbols enable\nthe user to define the water inside the island simpler than before. Defining\nwater inside the island is essential to apply island parsing for practical\nprogramming languages.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2020 14:54:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-02"}

The solution of the linear system\ncan be interpreted as the potentials of an electrical flow. Kelner, Orrechia,\nSidford, and Zhu (STOC 2013) give a combinatorial, near-linear time algorithm\nthat maintains the Kirchoff Current Law, and gradually enforces the Kirchoff\nPotential Law by updating flows around cycles (cycle toggling). In this paper,\nwe consider a dual version of the algorithm that maintains the Kirchoff\nPotential Law, and gradually enforces the Kirchoff Current Law by cut toggling:\neach iteration updates all potentials on one side of a fundamental cut of a\nspanning tree by the same amount. We prove that this dual algorithm also runs\nin a near-linear number of iterations.\n  We show, however, that if we abstract cut toggling as a natural data\nstructure problem, this problem can be reduced to the online\nvector-matrix-vector problem, which has been conjectured to be difficult for\ndynamic algorithms by Henzinger, Krinninger, Nanongkai, and Saranurak (STOC\n2015). The conjecture implies that a straightforward implementation of the\ncut-toggling algorithm requires essentially linear time per iteration. To\ncircumvent the lower bound, we batch update steps, and perform them\nsimultaneously instead of sequentially. An appropriate choice of batching leads\nto an $\\tilde{O}(m^{1.5})$ time cut-toggling algorithm for solving Laplacian\nsystems. Furthermore, if we sparsify the graph and call our algorithm\nrecursively on the Laplacian system implied by batching and sparsifying, the\nrunning time can be reduced to $O(m^{1+\\epsilon})$ for any $\\epsilon > 0$.\nThus, the dual cut-toggling algorithm can achieve (almost) the same running\ntime as its primal cycle-toggling counterpart.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2020 15:15:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Mar 2023 22:10:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-20"}

The\nfact that both the reaction and the diffusion parts dissipate the same free\nenergy opens a path of an energy stable, operator splitting scheme for these\nsystems.

We\ninvestigate the impact of mass-accretion efficiency onto compact objects and\ncommon-envelope efficiency on the observed distributions of $\\chi_{eff}$,\n$M_{chirp}$ and $q$. We find that low common envelope efficiency translates to\ntighter orbits post common envelope and therefore more tidally spun up\nsecond-born black holes. However, these systems have short merger timescales\nand are only marginally detectable by current gravitational-waves detectors as\nthey form and merge at high redshifts ($z\\sim 2$), outside current detector\nhorizons. Assuming Eddington-limited accretion efficiency and that the\nfirst-born black hole is formed with a negligible spin, we find that all\nnon-zero $\\chi_{eff}$ systems in the detectable population can come only from\nthe common envelope channel as the stable mass-transfer channel cannot shrink\nthe orbits enough for efficient tidal spin-up to take place. We find the local\nrate density ($z\\simeq 0.01$) for the common envelope channel is in the range\n$\\sim 17-113~Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}$ considering a range of $\\alpha_{CE} \\in\n[0.2,5.0]$ while for the stable mass transfer channel the rate density is $\\sim\n25~Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}$.

An approach to address this problem\nconsists of the use of adaptive model partitioning based on early-exit DNNs.\nAccordingly, the inference starts at the mobile device, and an intermediate\nlayer estimates the accuracy: If the estimated accuracy is sufficient, the\ndevice takes the inference decision; Otherwise, the remaining layers of the DNN\nrun at the cloud. Thus, the device offloads the inference to the cloud only if\nit cannot classify a sample with high confidence. This offloading requires a\ncorrect accuracy prediction at the device. Nevertheless, DNNs are typically\nmiscalibrated, providing overconfident decisions. This work shows that the\nemployment of a miscalibrated early-exit DNN for offloading via model\npartitioning can significantly decrease inference accuracy.

Specifically, we model the\nadmission of patients to a medical department using multiple independent\nqueues. Each queue represents a class of patients with similar treatment plans\nand hospital length-of-stay. By estimating the total workload of each class, we\nderive closed-form estimates for the expected amount of PPE required over a\nspecified time horizon using current PPE guidelines.

We find that gloves and surgical masks represent approximately\n90% of predicted PPE usage.

Using e-beam lithography, high aspect ratio Pt nanowires (~300 nm\nwidth, ~70 $\\mu$m length, ~100 nm thickness) were patterned on the surface of\noxidized silicon (Si) wafers. Combining precise wet etching processes with dry\netching processes, these Pt nanowires have been successfully released\nfree-standing between two silicon dioxide (SiO2) beams supported on Si\ncantilevers. Moreover, the unique design of the bridge holding the device\nallowed to release the device gently without damaging the Pt nanowires. The\ntotal fabrication time was minimized by restricting the use of e-beam\nlithography to the patterning of the Pt nanowires while standard\nphotolithography was employed for other parts of the devices. We demonstrate\nthat the fabricated sensors are suitable for turbulence measurements when\noperated in a constant-current mode. A robust calibration between output\nvoltage and fluid velocity was established over the velocity range from 0.5 m\ns-1 to 5 m s-1 in an SF6 atmosphere at a pressure of 2 bar and a temperature of\n21{\\deg}C. The sensing signal from the nanowires showed negligible drift over a\nperiod of several hours.

White-box\nadversarial attacks can fool neural networks with small adversarial\nperturbations, especially for large size images. However, keeping successful\nadversarial perturbations imperceptible is especially challenging for\ntransfer-based black-box adversarial attacks. Often such adversarial examples\ncan be easily spotted due to their unpleasantly poor visual qualities, which\ncompromises the threat of adversarial attacks in practice. In this study, to\nimprove the image quality of black-box adversarial examples perceptually, we\npropose structure-aware adversarial attacks by generating adversarial images\nbased on psychological perceptual models. Specifically, we allow higher\nperturbations on perceptually insignificant regions, while assigning lower or\nno perturbation on visually sensitive regions. In addition to the proposed\nspatial-constrained adversarial perturbations, we also propose a novel\nstructure-aware frequency adversarial attack method in the discrete cosine\ntransform (DCT) domain. Since the proposed attacks are independent of the\ngradient estimation, they can be directly incorporated with existing\ngradient-based attacks. Experimental results show that, with the comparable\nattack success rate (ASR), the proposed methods can produce adversarial\nexamples with considerably improved visual quality for free. With the\ncomparable perceptual quality, the proposed approaches achieve higher attack\nsuccess rates: particularly for the frequency structure-aware attacks, the\naverage ASR improves more than 10% over the baseline attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2020 07:17:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-11"}

The tip cavity\nis considered as filled by fluid vapors under constant pressure having a\nnegligible value with respect to the far field confining stress. A novel\nalgorithm is here presented, which is capable of tracking the evolution of both\nthe fluid and the fracture fronts. Particularly, the fracture tracking is\ngrounded on a recent viscous regularization of the quasi-static crack\npropagation problem as a standard dissipative system. It allows a simple and\neffective approximation of the fracture front velocity by imposing Griffith's\ncriterion at every propagation step. Furthermore, for each new fracture\nconfiguration, a non linear system of integro-differential equations has to be\nsolved. It arises from the non local elastic relationship existing between the\ncrack opening and the fluid pressure, together with the non linear lubrication\nequation governing the flow of the fluid inside the fracture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2020 15:06:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-13"}
