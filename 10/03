With simplicity bare in mind, we construct a\npretty concise and effective network with a newly proposed pixel attention\nscheme. Pixel attention (PA) is similar as channel attention and spatial\nattention in formulation. The difference is that PA produces 3D attention maps\ninstead of a 1D attention vector or a 2D map. This attention scheme introduces\nfewer additional parameters but generates better SR results. On the basis of\nPA, we propose two building blocks for the main branch and the reconstruction\nbranch, respectively. The first one - SC-PA block has the same structure as the\nSelf-Calibrated convolution but with our PA layer. This block is much more\nefficient than conventional residual/dense blocks, for its twobranch\narchitecture and attention scheme. While the second one - UPA block combines\nthe nearest-neighbor upsampling, convolution and PA layers. It improves the\nfinal reconstruction quality with little parameter cost. Our final model- PAN\ncould achieve similar performance as the lightweight networks - SRResNet and\nCARN, but with only 272K parameters (17.92% of SRResNet and 17.09% of CARN).\nThe effectiveness of each proposed component is also validated by ablation\nstudy.

However, a fixed architecture may not\nbe representative enough for data with high diversity. To promote the model\ncapacity, existing approaches usually employ larger convolutional kernels or\ndeeper network structure, which may increase the computational cost. In this\npaper, we address this issue by raising the Dynamic Graph Network (DG-Net). The\nnetwork learns the instance-aware connectivity, which creates different forward\npaths for different instances. Specifically, the network is initialized as a\ncomplete directed acyclic graph, where the nodes represent convolutional blocks\nand the edges represent the connection paths. We generate edge weights by a\nlearnable module \\textit{router} and select the edges whose weights are larger\nthan a threshold, to adjust the connectivity of the neural network structure.\nInstead of using the same path of the network, DG-Net aggregates features\ndynamically in each node, which allows the network to have more representation\nability. To facilitate the training, we represent the network connectivity of\neach sample in an adjacency matrix. The matrix is updated to aggregate features\nin the forward pass, cached in the memory, and used for gradient computing in\nthe backward pass. We verify the effectiveness of our method with several\nstatic architectures, including MobileNetV2, ResNet, ResNeXt, and RegNet.\nExtensive experiments are performed on ImageNet classification and COCO object\ndetection, which shows the effectiveness and generalization ability of our\napproach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Oct 2020 16:50:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-05"}

Jet energy and momentum\nloss described by the hybrid model become currents sourcing linearized\nhydrodynamics. By solving the linearized hydrodynamic equations numerically, we\ninvestigate the development of the wake in the dynamically evolving droplet of\nQGP, study the effect of viscosity, scrutinize energy-momentum conservation,\nand check the validity of the linear approximation. We find that linearized\nhydrodynamics works better in the viscous case because diffusive modes damp the\nenergy-momentum perturbation produced by the jet. We calculate the distribution\nof particles produced from the jet wake by using the Cooper-Frye prescription\nand find that both the transverse momentum spectrum and the distribution of\nparticles in azimuthal angle are similar in shape in linearized hydrodynamics\nand in the hybrid model. Their normalizations are different because the\nmomentum-rapidity distribution in the linearized hydrodynamics analysis is more\nspread out, due to sound modes. Since the Bjorken flow has no transverse\nexpansion, we explore the effect of transverse flow by using local boosts to\nadd it into the Cooper-Frye formula. After including the effects of transverse\nflow in this way, the transverse momentum spectrum becomes harder: more\nparticles with transverse momenta bigger than $2$ GeV are produced than in the\nhybrid model. Although we defer implementing this analysis in a jet Monte\nCarlo, as would be needed to make quantitative comparisons to data, we gain a\nqualitative sense of how the jet wake may modify jet observables by computing\nproxies for two example observables: the lost energy recovered in a cone of\nvarying open angle, and the fragmentation function.

However, training normalizing flows comes with\ndifficulties as well: models which produce good samples typically need to be\nextremely deep -- which comes with accompanying vanishing/exploding gradient\nproblems. A very related problem is that they are often poorly conditioned:\nsince they are parametrized as invertible maps from $\\mathbb{R}^d \\to\n\\mathbb{R}^d$, and typical training data like images intuitively is\nlower-dimensional, the learned maps often have Jacobians that are close to\nbeing singular.\n  In our paper, we tackle representational aspects around depth and\nconditioning of normalizing flows: both for general invertible architectures,\nand for a particular common architecture, affine couplings.

The frequencies, lifetimes, and eigenfunctions of solar acoustic\nwaves are affected by turbulent convection, which is random in space and in\ntime. Since the correlation time of solar granulation and the periods of\nacoustic waves ($\\sim$5 min) are similar, the medium in which the waves\npropagate cannot a priori be assumed to be time independent. Aims. We compare\nvarious effective-medium solutions with numerical solutions in order to\nidentify the approximations that can be used in helioseismology. For the sake\nof simplicity, the medium is one dimensional. Methods. We consider the Keller\napproximation, the second-order Born approximation, and spatial homogenization\nto obtain theoretical values for the effective wave speed and attenuation\n(averaged over the realizations of the medium). Numerically, we computed the\nfirst and second statistical moments of the wave field over many thousands of\nrealizations of the medium (finite-amplitude sound-speed perturbations are\nlimited to a 30 Mm band and have a zero mean). Results. The effective wave\nspeed is reduced for both the theories and the simulations. The attenuation of\nthe coherent wave field and the wave speed are best described by the Keller\ntheory. The numerical simulations reveal the presence of coda waves, trailing\nthe coherent wave packet. These late arrival waves are due to multiple\nscattering and are easily seen in the second moment of the wave field.\nConclusions. We find that the effective wave speed can be calculated,\nnumerically and theoretically, using a single snapshot of the random medium\n(frozen medium); however, the attenuation is underestimated in the frozen\nmedium compared to the time-dependent medium.

At one end of the spectrum, some work uses secure aggregation\ntechniques to hide the individual client's updates and only reveal the\naggregated global update to a malicious server that strives to infer the\nclients' privacy from their updates. At the other end of the spectrum, some\nwork uses Byzantine-robust FL protocols to suppress the influence of malicious\nclients' updates. We present a federated learning protocol F2ED-LEARNING,\nwhich, for the first time, offers bidirectional defense to simultaneously\ncombat against the malicious centralized server and Byzantine malicious\nclients. To defend against Byzantine malicious clients, F2ED-LEARNING provides\ndimension-free estimation error by employing and calibrating a well-studied\nrobust mean estimator FilterL2. F2ED-LEARNING also leverages secure aggregation\nto protect clients from a malicious server. One key challenge of F2ED-LEARNING\nis to address the incompatibility between FilterL2 and secure aggregation\nschemes.

Previous\nresearch argues this scenario is more common in high-dimensional settings.\nHowever, how effective sample size, dimensionality, and model\nperformance/generalization are formally related in supervised learning,\nconsidering the context of covariate shift adaptation, is still somewhat\nobscure in the literature.

At fixed halo mass in the mass range\n$10^{11.7}-10^{12.9}M_{\\odot}$, the median stellar masses of SDSS disc galaxies\nare up to a factor of 1.4 higher than the median masses of their elliptical\ncounterparts. However, when we switch from the stellar masses from Kauffmann et\nal. to those calculated by Chang et al. or Brinchmann et al., the median SHMR\nfrom discs and ellipticals coincide in this mass range. For halo masses larger\nthan $10^{13}M_{\\odot}$, discs are less massive than ellipticals in same-mass\nhaloes, regardless of whose stellar mass estimates we use.

Haloes with masses between $10^{11.5}$ and\n$10^{12}M_{\\odot}$, that host disc galaxies, were assembled earlier than those\nhosting ellipticals.

The data sources described earlier make two\n\"domains\": a hand-collected data domain of images with threats, and a\nreal-world domain of images assumed without threats. Two domain discriminators,\none for discriminating object proposals and one for image features, are\nadversarially trained to prevent encoding domain-specific information. Without\nthis penalty a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) can learn to identify domains\nbased on superficial characteristics, and minimize a supervised loss function\nwithout improving its ability to recognize objects. For the hand-collected\ndata, only object proposals and image features from backgrounds are used. The\nlosses for these domain-adaptive discriminators are added to the Faster R-CNN\nlosses of images from both domains. This can reduce threat detection false\nalarm rates by matching the statistics of extracted features from\nhand-collected backgrounds to real world data. Performance improvements are\ndemonstrated on two independently-collected datasets of labeled threats.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Oct 2020 21:05:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-06"}

Thus, we focus on the problem of jointly synthesizing a decoy\nplacement strategy and a deceptive defense strategy that maximally exploits the\nincomplete information the attacker about the decoy locations. We introduce a\nmodel of hypergames on graphs with temporal logic objectives to capture such\nadversarial interactions with asymmetric information.

Towards this\nend, this paper proposes a novel explainable AI (XAI) assisted convolutional\nneural network (CNN) classifier to predict near future stuttering by learning\ntemporal facial muscle movement patterns of AWS and explains the important\nfacial muscles and actions involved. Statistical analyses reveal significantly\nhigh prevalence of cheek muscles (p<0.005) and lip muscles (p<0.005) to predict\nstuttering and shows a behavior conducive of arousal and anticipation to speak.\nThe temporal study of these upper and lower facial muscles may facilitate early\ndetection of stuttering, promote automated assessment of stuttering and have\napplication in behavioral therapies by providing automatic non-invasive\nfeedback in realtime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Oct 2020 23:45:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-06"}

Based on this, we propose a novel uniform channel pruning\n(UCP) method to prune deep CNN, and the modified squeeze-and-excitation blocks\n(MSEB) is used to measure the importance of the channels in the convolutional\nlayers. The unimportant channels, including convolutional kernels related to\nthem, are pruned directly, which greatly reduces the storage cost and the\nnumber of calculations. There are two types of residual blocks in ResNet. For\nResNet with bottlenecks, we use the pruning method with traditional CNN to trim\nthe 3x3 convolutional layer in the middle of the blocks. For ResNet with basic\nresidual blocks, we propose an approach to consistently prune all residual\nblocks in the same stage to ensure that the compact network structure is\ndimensionally correct. Considering that the network loses considerable\ninformation after pruning and that the larger the pruning amplitude is, the\nmore information that will be lost, we do not choose fine-tuning but retrain\nfrom scratch to restore the accuracy of the network after pruning. Finally, we\nverified our method on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ILSVRC-2012 for image\nclassification. The results indicate that the performance of the compact\nnetwork after retraining from scratch, when the pruning rate is small, is\nbetter than the original network.

On the CIFAR-100, when\nreducing the parameters and FLOPs up to 82% and 62% respectively, the accuracy\nof VGG-19 even improved by 0.54% after retraining.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Oct 2020 01:51:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-06"}

However, using this kind of data induces the over-generation\nproblem posing difficulties for existing models, which tends to add unrelated\nexcerpts during the generation procedure. In order to effectively utilize\nautomatically annotated partially-aligned datasets, we extend the traditional\ngeneration task to a refined task called Partially-Aligned Data-to-Text\nGeneration (PADTG) which is more practical since it utilizes automatically\nannotated data for training and thus considerably expands the application\ndomains. To tackle this new task, we propose a novel distant supervision\ngeneration framework. It firstly estimates the input data's supportiveness for\neach target word with an estimator and then applies a supportiveness adaptor\nand a rebalanced beam search to harness the over-generation problem in the\ntraining and generation phases respectively. We also contribute a\npartially-aligned dataset (The data and source code of this paper can be\nobtained from https://github.com/fuzihaofzh/distant_supervision_nlg by sampling\nsentences from Wikipedia and automatically extracting corresponding KB triples\nfor each sentence from Wikidata.

We show that by\ntreating the secant condition with a penalty method approach motivated by\nregularized least squares estimation, one can smoothly interpolate between\nupdating the inverse Hessian approximation with the original BFGS update\nformula and not updating the inverse Hessian approximation. Furthermore, we\nfind the curvature condition is smoothly relaxed as the interpolation moves\ntowards not updating the inverse Hessian approximation, disappearing entirely\nwhen the inverse Hessian approximation is not updated. These developments allow\nus to develop a method we refer to as secant penalized BFGS (SP-BFGS) that\nallows one to relax the secant condition based on the amount of noise in the\ngradient measurements. SP-BFGS provides a means of incrementally updating the\nnew inverse Hessian approximation with a controlled amount of bias towards the\nprevious inverse Hessian approximation, which allows one to replace the\noverwriting nature of the original BFGS update with an averaging nature that\nresists the destructive effects of noise and can cope with negative curvature\nmeasurements.

Finally,\nthese bounding box metadata are classified by a recurrent neural network (RNN).\nIn addition, we made a dual-labeled dataset named \"BEAUTY\" (Building dEtection\nAnd Urban funcTional-zone portraYing) of 19,070 street view images and 38,857\nbuildings based on the existing BIC GSV [1]. The dataset can be used not only\nfor street view image classification, but also for multi-class building\ndetection. Experiments on \"BEAUTY\" show that the proposed approach achieves a\n12.65% performance improvement on macro-precision and 12% on macro-recall over\nimage-level CNN based models.

In many applications,\ndue to user's privacy concern, overwhelming network scale etc., it is hard to\ntarget any user in the network as one wishes. Instead, only a small subset of\nusers is initially accessible. Such access limitation would significantly\nimpair the influence spread, since IM often relies on seeding high degree\nusers, which are particularly rare in such a small subset due to the power-law\nstructure of social networks. In this paper, we attempt to solve the limited IM\nin real-world scenarios by the adaptive approach with seeding and diffusion\nuncertainty considered. Specifically, we consider fine-grained discounts and\nassume users accept the discount probabilistically. The diffusion process is\ndepicted by the independent cascade model. To overcome the access limitation,\nwe prove the set-wise friendship paradox (FP) phenomenon that neighbors have\nhigher degree in expectation, and propose a two-stage seeding model with the FP\nembedded, where neighbors are seeded. On this basis, for comparison we\nformulate the non-adaptive case and adaptive case, both proven to be NP-hard.\nIn the non-adaptive case, discounts are allocated to users all at once. We show\nthe monotonicity of influence spread w.r.t. discount allocation and design a\ntwo-stage coordinate descent framework to decide the discount allocation. In\nthe adaptive case, users are sequentially seeded based on observations of\nexisting seeding and diffusion results. We prove the adaptive submodularity and\nsubmodularity of the influence spread function in two stages. Then, a series of\nadaptive greedy algorithms are proposed with constant approximation ratio.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Oct 2020 11:47:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-06"}

In this paper, we address this issue and propose a\nmethod to effectively compress Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) such as Gated\nRecurrent Units (GRUs) and Long-Short-Term-Memory Units (LSTMs) that are used\nfor HAR. We use a Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) theory-based pruning\napproach to limit the information flow through the sequential cells of RNNs to\na small subset. Further, we combine our pruning method with a specific\ngroup-lasso regularization technique that significantly improves compression.\nThe proposed techniques reduce model parameters and memory footprint from\nlatent representations, with little or no reduction in the validation accuracy\nwhile increasing the inference speed several-fold. We perform experiments on\nthe three widely used Action Recognition datasets, viz. UCF11, HMDB51, and\nUCF101, to validate our approach. It is shown that our method achieves over 70\ntimes greater compression than the nearest competitor with comparable accuracy\nfor the task of action recognition on UCF11.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Oct 2020 12:41:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Nov 2020 14:36:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-10"}

We argue that these challenges arise in part due to the intrinsic\nrigidity of operating at the level of actions. Actions can precisely define how\nto perform an activity but are ill-suited to describe what activity to perform.\nInstead, causal effects are inherently composable and temporally abstract,\nmaking them ideal for descriptive tasks. By leveraging a hierarchy of causal\neffects, this study aims to expedite the learning of task-specific behavior and\naid exploration. Borrowing counterfactual and normality measures from causal\nliterature, we disentangle controllable effects from effects caused by other\ndynamics of the environment. We propose CEHRL, a hierarchical method that\nmodels the distribution of controllable effects using a Variational\nAutoencoder. This distribution is used by a high-level policy to 1) explore the\nenvironment via random effect exploration so that novel effects are\ncontinuously discovered and learned, and to 2) learn task-specific behavior by\nprioritizing the effects that maximize a given reward function. In comparison\nto exploring with random actions, experimental results show that random effect\nexploration is a more efficient mechanism and that by assigning credit to few\neffects rather than many actions, CEHRL learns tasks more rapidly.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Oct 2020 13:19:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Feb 2022 19:18:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-23"}

In this work, we present a first-principles\ninvestigation on the stability and electronic properties of ultrathin bilayer\nheterostructures composed of InSe and Sb single layers. The calculated\nelectronic band structures reveal a direct band gap semiconducting nature of\nthe InSe/Sb heterostructures independent of stacking pattern. Taking spin-orbit\ncoupling into account, we find a large Rashba spin splitting at the bottom of\nconduction band, which originates from the atomic spin-orbit coupling with the\nsymmetry breaking in the heterostructure. The strength of the Rashba spin\nsplitting can be tuned by applying in-plane biaxial strain or an out-of-plane\nexternal electric field. The presence of large Rashba spin splitting together\nwith a suitable band gap in InSe/Sb bilayer heterostructures make them\npromising candidates for spin field-effect transistor and optoelectronic device\napplications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Oct 2020 13:30:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 14 Dec 2021 13:08:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-15"}

The well-engineered form of this practice is proved to\ndecrease the transaction costs at a collective level.

To address\nthe coupling in the decisions of different time frames, we propose a novel\nframework, named LyDROO, that combines the advantages of Lyapunov optimization\nand deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Specifically, LyDROO first applies\nLyapunov optimization to decouple the multi-stage stochastic MINLP into\ndeterministic per-frame MINLP subproblems.

Firstly, the formalism of 1D\nmaximum length deformed algebra is extended to arbitrary dimensions. Then, by\nemploying the adapted semiclassical approach, the thermostatistics of an ideal\ngas and a system of harmonic oscillators (HOs) is investigated.

As\na consequence, the model output depends only on its internal hidden dynamics\nand the closed-loop feedback of its own predictions; its hidden state is\ncontinuously adapted by means of the temporal gradient resulting from\nbackpropagating the discrepancy between the signal observations and the model\noutputs through time.

The model\noutperformed the existing conventional methods for the diagnosis of brain tumor\nin the test dataset (Precision = 0.93, Sensitivity = 1.00, and F1-score =\n0.97). Moreover, the proposed model's average precision-recall score is 0.93,\nCohen's Kappa 0.91, and AUC 0.95. Therefore, the proposed model can help\nclinical experts verify whether the patient has a brain tumor and,\nconsequently, accelerate the treatment procedure.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Oct 2020 07:42:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-19"}
