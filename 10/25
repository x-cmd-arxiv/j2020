The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic underscores the\ntrade-off arising from public health and economic cost. An optimal lockdown\npolicy to resolve this trade-off is highly desired. Here we propose a\nmathematical framework of pandemic control through an optimal stabilizing\nnon-uniform lockdown, where our goal is to reduce the economic activity as\nlittle as possible while decreasing the number of infected individuals at a\nprescribed rate. This framework allows us to efficiently compute the optimal\nstabilizing lockdown policy for general epidemic spread models, including both\nthe classical SIS/SIR/SEIR models and a new model of COVID-19 transmissions. We\ndemonstrate the power of this framework by analyzing publicly available data of\ninter-county travel frequencies to analyze a model of COVID-19 spread in the 62\ncounties of New York State. We find that an optimal stabilizing lockdown based\non epidemic status in April 2020 would have reduced economic activity more\nstringently outside of New York City compared to within it, even though the\nepidemic was much more prevalent in New York City at that point. Such a\ncounterintuitive result highlights the intricacies of pandemic control and\nsheds light on future lockdown policy design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Oct 2020 16:12:16 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Nov 2020 02:31:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 26 Jan 2021 22:53:37 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 25 Jan 2022 02:31:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-26"}

However, longitudinal MRI change measures can\nbe confounded by non-biological factors, such as different degrees of head\nmotion and susceptibility artifact between pairs of MRI scans. We hypothesize\nthat deep learning methods applied directly to pairs of longitudinal MRI scans\ncan be trained to differentiate between biological changes and non-biological\nfactors better than conventional approaches based on deformable image\nregistration. To achieve this, we make a simplifying assumption that biological\nfactors are associated with time (i.e. the hippocampus shrinks overtime in the\naging population) whereas non-biological factors are independent of time. We\nthen formulate deep learning networks to infer the temporal order of\nsame-subject MRI scans input to the network in arbitrary order; as well as to\ninfer ratios between interscan intervals for two pairs of same-subject MRI\nscans. In the test dataset, these networks perform better in tasks of temporal\nordering (89.3%) and interscan interval inference (86.1%) than a\nstate-of-the-art deformation-based morphometry method ALOHA (76.6% and 76.1%\nrespectively) (Das et al., 2012).

Autocorrelation timescale analysis compared against DNN skill\nsuggests the less good fit in the tropical, marine boundary layer is driven by\nneural network difficulty emulating fast, stochastic signals in convection.\nHowever, spectral analysis in the temporal domain indicates skillful emulation\nof signals on diurnal to synoptic scales. A close look at the diurnal cycle\nreveals correct emulation of land-sea contrasts and vertical structure in the\nheating and moistening fields, but some distortion of precipitation.\nSensitivity tests targeting precipitation skill reveal complementary effects of\nadding positive constraints vs. hyperparameter tuning, motivating the use of\nboth in the future. A first attempt to force an offline land model with DNN\nemulated atmospheric fields produces reassuring results further supporting\nneural network emulation viability in real-geography settings. Overall, the fit\nskill is competitive with recent attempts by sophisticated Residual and\nConvolutional Neural Network architectures trained on added information,\nincluding memory of past states. Our results confirm the parameterizability of\nsuperparameterized convection with continents through machine learning and we\nhighlight advantages of casting this problem locally in space and time for\naccurate emulation and hopefully quick implementation of hybrid climate models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Oct 2020 21:42:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Feb 2021 09:17:13 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 20 Apr 2021 18:22:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-09"}

Although FC is proved to be a good starting point to understand the\nbrain organization, it fails to tell the causal relationship or the direction\nof interactions. Many directed acyclic graph (DAG) based methods were applied\nto study the directed interactions using functional magnetic resonance imaging\n(fMRI) data but the performance was severely limited by the small sample size\nand high dimensionality, hindering its applications. To overcome the obstacles,\nwe propose a score based joint directed acyclic graph model to estimate the\ndirected FC in fMRI data. Instead of using a combinatorial optimization\nframework, the structure of DAG is characterized with an algebra equation and\nfurther regularized with sparsity and group similarity terms. The simulation\nresults have demonstrated the improved accuracy of the proposed model in\ndetecting causality as compared to other existing methods. In our case-control\nstudy of the MIND Clinical Imaging Consortium (MCIC) data, we have successfully\nidentified decreased functional integration, disrupted hub structures and\ncharacteristic edges (CtEs) in schizophrenia (SZ) patients. Further comparison\nbetween the results from directed FC and undirected FC illustrated the their\ndifferent emphasis on selected features.

However, the\ndefinition of \"computable knowledge object\" remains controversial so far in\ndifferent fields. For example, it is defined as 1) quantitative scientific\nconcept in natural science and engineering, 2) knowledge point in the field of\neducation research, and 3) semantic predications, i.e.,\nSubject-Predicate-Object (SPO) triples in biomedical fields. The Semantic\nMEDLINE Database (SemMedDB), a high-quality public repository of SPO triples\nextracted from medical literature, provides a basic data infrastructure for\nmeasuring medical knowledge. In general, the study of extracting SPO triples as\ncomputable knowledge unit from unstructured scientific text has been\noverwhelmingly focusing on scientific knowledge per se. Since the SPO triples\nwould be possibly extracted from hypothetical, speculative statements or even\nconflicting and contradictory assertions, the knowledge status (i.e., the\nuncertainty), which serves as an integral and critical part of scientific\nknowledge has been largely overlooked. This article aims to put forward a\nframework for Medical Knowmetrics using the SPO triples as the knowledge unit\nand the uncertainty as the knowledge context. The lung cancer publications\ndataset is used to validate the proposed framework. The uncertainty of medical\nknowledge and how its status evolves over time indirectly reflect the strength\nof competing knowledge claims, and the probability of certainty for a given SPO\ntriple.

Most\nof the existing real-world adversarial attacks against object detectors use an\nadversarial patch which is attached to the target object (e.g., a carefully\ncrafted sticker placed on a stop sign). This method may not be robust to\nchanges in the camera's location relative to the target object; in addition, it\nmay not work well when applied to nonplanar objects such as cars. In this\nstudy, we present an innovative attack method against object detectors applied\nin a real-world setup that addresses some of the limitations of existing\nattacks. Our method uses dynamic adversarial patches which are placed at\nmultiple predetermined locations on a target object. An adversarial learning\nalgorithm is applied in order to generate the patches used. The dynamic attack\nis implemented by switching between optimized patches dynamically, according to\nthe camera's position (i.e., the object detection system's position). In order\nto demonstrate our attack in a real-world setup, we implemented the patches by\nattaching flat screens to the target object; the screens are used to present\nthe patches and switch between them, depending on the current camera location.\nThus, the attack is dynamic and adjusts itself to the situation to achieve\noptimal results. We evaluated our dynamic patch approach by attacking the\nYOLOv2 object detector with a car as the target object and succeeded in\nmisleading it in up to 90% of the video frames when filming the car from a wide\nviewing angle range.

Five-zero textures are\nimposed in the final $4\\times4$ active-sterile mass matrix, which significantly\nreduces free parameter in the model. Three right-handed neutrinos were\nconsidered, two of them have nearly degenerate masses which help us to achieve\nbaryogenesis via resonant leptogenesis. A singlet fermion (sterile neutrino)\nwith mass $\\sim\\mathcal{O}$(eV) is also considered, and we are able to put\nbounds on active-sterile mixing parameters via neutrino oscillation data.\nResonant enhancement of lepton asymmetry is studied at TeV scale, where we\ndiscuss a few aspects of baryogenesis considering the flavour effects.\nPossibility of improvement in effective mass from $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ in the\npresence of a single generation of sterile neutrino flavour is also studied\nwithin the fermion sector. In the scalar sector, the imaginary component of the\ncomplex singlet scalar is behaving as a potential dark matter candidate and\nsimultaneously the real part of the complex scalar is associated with the\nfermion sector for sterile mass generation. A broad region of dark matter mass\nis analyzed from various annihilation processes, and the VEV of the complex\nscalar plays a pivotal role to achieve the observed relic density at the right\nballpark.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Oct 2020 10:47:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 28 Apr 2022 05:17:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-29"}

To realize this, we propose a\nHierarchical Target-oriented Multi-Agent Coordination (HiT-MAC), which\ndecomposes the target coverage problem into two-level tasks: targets assignment\nby a coordinator and tracking assigned targets by executors. Specifically, the\ncoordinator periodically monitors the environment globally and allocates\ntargets to each executor. In turn, the executor only needs to track its\nassigned targets. To effectively learn the HiT-MAC by reinforcement learning,\nwe further introduce a bunch of practical methods, including a self-attention\nmodule, marginal contribution approximation for the coordinator,\ngoal-conditional observation filter for the executor, etc. Empirical results\ndemonstrate the advantage of HiT-MAC in coverage rate, learning efficiency,and\nscalability, comparing to baselines.

This latent power\nstructure influences women's decision-making and experiences in several ways.\nIn the academic field, it produces unequal competition in a male dominated\nplayground. In the social sphere, choosing a demanding academic career is seen\nas disrupting gender order. Within the family, women carry a greater burden of\nfamily work and give precedence to their partner's career and preferences.\nWithin this social structure, women who decide to follow an academic career\nfeel that they must excel. The demand for excellence acts as an invisible\nbarrier within the gender power structure that prevents talented women from\npursuing an academic career in physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Oct 2020 13:29:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-21"}

This question poses a challenging problem, as developer\nadjustments can change which hyperparameter settings perform well, or even the\nhyperparameter search space itself. While many approaches exist that leverage\nknowledge obtained on previous tasks, so far, knowledge from previous\ndevelopment steps remains entirely untapped. In this work, we remedy this\nsituation and propose a new research framework: hyperparameter transfer across\nadjustments (HT-AA). To lay a solid foundation for this research framework, we\nprovide four simple HT-AA baseline algorithms and eight benchmarks changing\nvarious aspects of ML algorithms, their hyperparameter search spaces, and the\nneural architectures used. The best baseline, on average and depending on the\nbudgets for the old and new HPO, reaches a given performance 1.2--2.6x faster\nthan a prominent HPO algorithm without transfer. As HPO is a crucial step in ML\ndevelopment but requires extensive computational resources, this speedup would\nlead to faster development cycles, lower costs, and reduced environmental\nimpacts. To make these benefits available to ML developers off-the-shelf and to\nfacilitate future research on HT-AA, we provide python packages for our\nbaselines and benchmarks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Oct 2020 13:35:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-27"}

Their diverse\nprospective applications in electronics and energy storage devices have\ntriggered great interests in science and technology. MXenes can be\nfunctionalized by different surface terminations. Some O and F functionalized\nMXenes monolayers have been predicted to be topological insulators (TIs).\nHowever, the reported OH functionalized MXenes TIs are very few and their\nelectronic structures need to be investigated in more detail. It has been\nrevealed that the work functions of MXenes are reduced significantly by OH\ntermination and the image potential (IP) states move close to the Fermi level.\nThe wave functions of these IP states are spatially extensive outside the\nsurfaces. By stacking the OH-functionalized MXenes, the energies of the IP\nstates can be modulated by the interlayer distances of multilayers, because the\noverlap and hybridization of the wave functions between the neighboring layers\nare significant. Therefore, these stacking layers are interacted and coupled\nwith IP states. Here, based on first-principles calculations, we demonstrate\nthat the stacking of two-dimensional topologically trivial OH-functionalized\nMXenes, such as V$_2$HfC$_2$(OH)$_2$, possibly gives rise to the topologically\nnontrivial energy bands.

We interpret the basis as a learned embedding into a higher\ndimensional space. Following the functional map paradigm the optimal\ntransformation in this embedding space must be linear and we propose a separate\narchitecture aimed at estimating the transformation by learning optimal\ndescriptor functions. This leads to the first end-to-end trainable functional\nmap-based correspondence approach in which both the basis and the descriptors\nare learned from data.

From the J-map, we built an intensity on\nimpact-radius-on-Thomson-surface map (R-map). Finally, we constructed a\nlatitudinal intensity versus time map (Lat-map).

We introduce a cubic\nonsite-nonlinearity and study this nonlinear effect on the edge state's\nfrequency and linear stability. Nonlinear continuation reveals that the edge\nstate loses its typical shape enforced by the chiral symmetry and becomes\ngenerally unstable due to various types of instabilities that we analyze using\na combination of spectral stability and Krein signature analysis.

Furthermore, this paper\nsuggests a mechanism to implement optical computers currently under development\nand research based on structures rather than devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 25 Oct 2020 11:41:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-28"}

Next, a deep-learning model was developed for prediction\nof diabetic retinopathy from retinal fundus images by a modified and re-trained\nInceptionV3 image classification model. The input was simplified by\nautomatically segmenting the blood vessels in the retinal image. The technique\nof transfer learning enables the model to capitalize on existing infrastructure\non the target device, meaning more versatile deployment, especially helpful in\nlow-resource settings. The models were integrated into a smartphone-based\ndevice, combined with an inexpensive 3D-printed retinal imaging attachment.\nAccuracy scores, as well as the receiver operating characteristic curve, the\nlearning curve, and other gauges, were promising.
