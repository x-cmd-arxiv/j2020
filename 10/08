For\npartial actions with the Rokhlin property, being an AF-algebra is also\npreserved. Some of our results are new even in the global case.\n  We also study the Rokhlin dimension of globalizable actions: while in general\nit differs from the Rokhlin dimension of its globalization, we show that they\nagree if the coefficient algebra is unital. For topological partial actions on\nspaces of finite covering dimension, we show that finiteness of the Rokhlin\ndimension is equivalent to freeness, thus providing a large class of examples\nto which our theory applies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Oct 2020 16:31:07 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 23 Jan 2022 17:44:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-25"}

Particularly crucial is\nthe question of what sets the peak of the distribution. To investigate this\nissue we perform high resolution numerical simulations with radiative feedback\nexploring in particular the role of the stellar and accretion luminosities. We\nalso perform simulations with a simple effective equation of state (eos) and we\ninvestigate 1000 solar mass clumps having respectively 0.1 and 0.4 pc of\ninitial radii. We found that most runs, both with radiative transfer or an eos,\npresent similar mass spectra with a peak broadly located around 0.3-0.5\nM$_\\odot$ and a powerlaw-like mass distribution at higher masses. However, when\naccretion luminosity is accounted for, the resulting mass spectrum of the most\ncompact clump tends to be moderately top-heavy. The effect remains limited for\nthe less compact one, which overall remains colder. Our results support the\nidea that rather than the radiative stellar feedback, this is the transition\nfrom the isothermal to the adiabatic regime, which occurs at a gas density of\nabout 10$^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$, that is responsible for setting the peak of the\ninitial mass function. This stems for the fact that $i)$ extremely compact\nclumps for which the accretion luminosity has a significant influence are very\nrare and $ii)$ because of the luminosity problem, which indicates that the\neffective accretion luminosity is likely weaker than expected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Oct 2020 17:35:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-16"}

This calls for continuous efforts in code development, which is\nnecessitated also by the rapidly evolving technology underlying today's\ncomputing hardware. Here we discuss recent methodological progress in the\nGADGET code, which has been widely applied in cosmic structure formation over\nthe past two decades. The new version offers improvements in force accuracy, in\ntime-stepping, in adaptivity to a large dynamic range in timescales, in\ncomputational efficiency, and in parallel scalability through a special\nMPI/shared-memory parallelization and communication strategy, and a\nmore-sophisticated domain decomposition algorithm. A manifestly momentum\nconserving fast multipole method (FMM) can be employed as an alternative to the\none-sided TreePM gravity solver introduced in earlier versions. Two different\nflavours of smoothed particle hydrodynamics, a classic entropy-conserving\nformulation and a pressure-based approach, are supported for dealing with\ngaseous flows. The code is able to cope with very large problem sizes, thus\nallowing accurate predictions for cosmic structure formation in support of\nfuture precision tests of cosmology, and at the same time is well adapted to\nhigh dynamic range zoom-calculations with extreme variability of the particle\nnumber density in the simulated volume.

Due to the\ndifference between sub-horizon and super-horizon physics, it is inevitable that\nthere will be a distinct spectral feature that could allow for the direct\nmeasurement of the conformal Hubble rate at which the phase transition\noccurred. As an example, free-streaming particles (such as the gravity waves\nthemselves) present during the phase transition affect the production of\nsuper-horizon modes.

Remarkably, such energy\nshifts are rather insensitive to electromagnetic interactions that represent\nthe largest background in searches for new forces using atomic matter. This is\nbecause nuclei are intrinsically shielded by the electron clouds. Additionally,\nelectromagnetic interactions cause energy shifts by coupling to nuclear moments\nthat are suppressed by the size of the nuclei, while new scalar interactions\ncan directly affect these shifts. Finally, averaging over unpolarized nuclei,\nfurther reduces electromagnetic interactions.

Specifically, a smooth lattice cutoff to the linear\ndispersion, which is ubiquitous in real Weyl materials, introduces nonlinearity\nin the problem and also drives the system to exhibit negative LMC for\nnon-collinear electric and magnetic fields even in the limit of vanishing\nintervalley scattering. We examine longitudinal magnetoconductivity and the\nplanar Hall effect semi-analytically for a lattice model of tilted Weyl\nfermions within the Boltzmann approximation. We independently study the effects\nof a finite lattice cutoff and tilt parameters and construct phase diagrams in\nrelevant parameter spaces that are relevant for diagnosing chiral anomaly in\nreal Weyl materials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Oct 2020 18:21:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-31"}

This allows for flexible programming\npatterns, but presents challenges for type systems. In particular, a simple\ntreatment of method extraction would require methods to be contravariant in the\nreceiver type, making overriding all-but-impossible. We present a detailed\ninvestigation of this problem, as well as an implemented and evaluated\nsolution. Method extraction is a feature of many dynamically-typed and\ngradually-typed languages, ranging from Python and PHP to Flow and TypeScript.\nIn these languages, the underlying representation of objects as records of\nprocedures can be accessed, and the procedures that implement methods can be\nreified as functions that can be called independently. In many of these\nlanguages, the programmer can then explicitly specify the `this` value to be\nused when the method implementation is called. Unfortunately, as we show,\nexisting gradual type systems such as TypeScript and Flow are unsound in the\npresence of method extraction. The problem for typing any such system is that\nthe flexibility it allows must be tamed by requiring a connection between the\nobject the method was extracted from, and the function value that is later\ncalled. In Racket, where a method extraction-like facility, dubbed \"structure\ntype properties\", is fundamental to classes, generic methods, and other APIs,\nthese same challenges arise, and must be solved to support this feature in\nTyped Racket. We show how to combine two existing type system features --\nexistential types and occurrence typing -- to produce a sound approach to\ntyping method extraction. We formalize our design, extending an existing formal\nmodel of the Typed Racket type system, and prove that our extension is sound.\nOur design is also implemented in the released version of Racket, and is\ncompatible with all existing Typed Racket packages, many of which already used\na previous version of this feature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Oct 2020 19:05:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 30 Jul 2021 19:51:02 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 19 Nov 2021 20:18:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-23"}

The data handling allows flexible medical image handling in\nevery commonly used format (e.g., 2-D, 2.5-D, and 3-D; full- or patch-wise).\nEven data beyond images like demographics or clinical reports can easily be\nintegrated into deep learning pipelines.

Prior\nmultivariate models have tried to predict mortality risk, but due to several\nlimitations like one-time prediction at the time of admission, they have not\nproven clinically useful. There is a need for a dynamic model that captures\nevolving physiologic changes during patient's hospital course to trauma and\nresuscitation for mortality prediction. The Parkland Trauma Index of Mortality\n(PTIM) is a machine learning algorithm that uses electronic medical record\n(EMR) data to predict $48-$hour mortality during the first $72$ hours of\nhospitalization. The model updates every hour, evolving with the patient's\nphysiologic response to trauma. Area under (AUC) the receiver-operator\ncharacteristic curve (ROC), sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and\nnegative predictive value (NPV), and positive and negative likelihood ratios\n(LR) were used to evaluate model performance. By evolving with the patient's\nphysiologic response to trauma and relying only on EMR data, the PTIM overcomes\nmany of the limitations of prior mortality risk models.

One of the classical tools in this context is the Cremer optimum\nconcept that aims to maximize the attenuation of the least attenuated mode.\nHowever, a typical sound field may be a superposition of a large number of\ntransverse modes which are nonorthogonal, and the individual mode attenuation\nmay have little to do with the total sound power attenuation.

The sound may be almost non-decaying\nalong the waveguide transition region for any lossy impedance boundary\nconditions although all modes attenuate exponentially.

The resulting hybrid control algorithm proves versatile in preparing\nthe ground state of quantum-chaotic many-body spin chains by minimizing the\nenergy. We show that using terms occurring in the adiabatic gauge potential as\ngenerators of additional control unitaries, it is possible to achieve fast\nhigh-fidelity many-body control away from the adiabatic regime.

This work addresses the following question: How do out-of-distribution\n(OOD) data adversely affect semi-supervised learning algorithms? To answer this\nquestion, we investigate the critical causes of OOD's negative effect on SSL\nalgorithms. In particular, we found that 1) certain kinds of OOD data instances\nthat are close to the decision boundary have a more significant impact on\nperformance than those that are further away, and 2) Batch Normalization (BN),\na popular module, may degrade rather than improve performance when the\nunlabeled set contains OODs. In this context, we developed a unified weighted\nrobust SSL framework that can be easily extended to many existing SSL\nalgorithms and improve their robustness against OODs. More specifically, we\ndeveloped an efficient bi-level optimization algorithm that could accommodate\nhigh-order approximations of the objective and scale to multiple inner\noptimization steps to learn a massive number of weight parameters while\noutperforming existing low-order approximations of bi-level optimization.\nFurther, we conduct a theoretical study of the impact of faraway OODs in the BN\nstep and propose a weighted batch normalization (WBN) procedure for improved\nperformance.

COHORT is a practical,\nscalable, and versatile solution that coordinates a population of TCLs to\njointly optimize a grid-level objective, while satisfying each TCL's end-use\nrequirements and operational constraints.

The object we focus at is an\nelementary unit of this composite, for which we take a set consisting of a\npermanent spherical micromagnet surrounded by an elastomer layer filled with\nmagnetically soft microparticles. We present a comparative treatment of this\nunit from two essentially different viewpoints. The first one is a\ncoarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation model, which presents the\ncomposite as a bead-spring assembly and is able to deliver information of all\nthe microstructural changes of the assembly. The second approach is entirely\nbased on the continuum magnetomechanical description of the system, whose\ndirect yield is the macroscopic field-induced response of the MAE to external\nfield, as this model ignores all the microstructural details of the\nmagnetization process.

Decamouflage consists of three independent detection methods: (1)\nrescaling, (2) filtering/pooling, and (3) steganalysis. While each of these\nthree methods is efficient standalone, they can work in an ensemble manner not\nonly to improve the detection accuracy but also to harden potential adaptive\nattacks.

The proposed artifact\nreduction method is designed to improve the quality of maxillofacial imaging,\nwhere soft tissue details are not required. Compared to standard CT, the\nadditional difficulty of dental CBCT comes from the problems caused by offset\ndetector, FOV truncation, and low signal-to-noise ratio due to low X-ray\nirradiation. To address these problems, the proposed method primarily performs\na sinogram adjustment in the direction of enhancing data consistency,\nconsidering the situation according to the FOV truncation and offset detector.\nThis sinogram correction algorithm significantly reduces beam hardening\nartifacts caused by high-density materials such as teeth, bones, and metal\nimplants, while tending to amplify special types of noise. To suppress such\nnoise, a deep convolutional neural network is complementarily used, where CT\nimages adjusted by the sinogram correction are used as the input of the neural\nnetwork. Numerous experiments validate that the proposed method successfully\nreduces beam hardening artifacts and, in particular, has the advantage of\nimproving the image quality of teeth, associated with maxillofacial CBCT\nimaging.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Oct 2020 05:48:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-09"}

Upon melting, the crystalline long-range order\nvanishes, turning the solid to a fluid. In contrast to this classical scenario\nof solid melting, here we demonstrate a counter-intuitive behavior of the\noccurrence of crystalline long-range order in an initially disordered matrix.\nThis unusual solidification is demonstrated in a system of passive colloidal\nparticles accommodating chemically active defects -- photocatalytic Janus\nparticles. The observed crystallization occurs when the amount of\nactive-defect-induced fluctuations (which is the measure of the effective\ntemperature) reaches critical value. The driving mechanism behind this unusual\nbehavior is purely internal and resembles a blast-induced solidification. Here\nthe role of \"internal micro-blasts\" is played by the photochemical activity of\ndefects residing in the colloidal matrix. The defect-induced solidification\noccurs under non-equilibrium conditions: the resulting solid exists as long as\na constant supply of energy in the form of ion flow is provided by the\ncatalytic photochemical reaction at the surface of active Janus particle\ndefects. Our findings could be useful for understanding of the phase\ntransitions of matter under extreme conditions far from thermodynamic\nequilibrium.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Oct 2020 06:55:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-12"}

This\nphenomenon is phased-matched through the relative phase detuning between the\nintracavity fields associated with the two principal polarization modes of the\ncavity. Our experimental investigation is based on a 12-m long fiber ring\nresonator in which a polarization controller is inserted to finely control the\nlevel of intra-cavity birefringence. Depending on the amount of birefringence,\nthe temporal patterns generated via PMI are found to be either stationary or to\nexhibit a period-doubled dynamics. Experimental results are in good agreement\nwith numerical simulations based on an Ikeda map for the two orthogonally\npolarized modes. Our study provides new insights into the control of modulation\ninstability in multimode Kerr resonators. Modulation instability (MI) is a\nnonlinear phenomenon characterized by the exponential growth and evolution of\nperiodic perturbations on top of an intense continuous-wave (cw) laser beam [1,\n2]. Underpinned by a nonlinearly phase-matched parametric process, it is\nassociated with a transfer of energy from a narrow pump frequency component to\na pair of sidebands arranged symmetrically around the pump. In single-pass\noptical fiber propagation, MI can be naturally phase-matched through a balance\nbetween anomalous group-velocity dispersion and Kerr nonlinearity [1, 2]. In\ncontrast, more general phase-matching conditions are possible in the context of\npassive Kerr resonators, such as fiber ring cavities, because of the crucial\nrole played by the systems' boundary conditions [3-5]. Various configurations\nof MI have been investigated in that context, including MI in the normal\ndispersion regime, MI via bichromatic or incoherent driving, as well as\ncompetition between MI and Faraday or period-doubled (P2) instabilities\n[6--12]. Moreover, at variance with single-pass propagation, MI in Kerr\nresonators can lead to the emergence of stationary periodic (Turing) patterns;\nsuch patterns are now understood to be intimately related to temporal cavity\nsolitons and microresonator optical frequency combs [13--16]. Birefringence,\nand nonlinear coupling between the polarization components of light, is also\nknown to contribute to the phase-matching of parametric processes. This leads\nto polarization MI (PMI) and the emergence of vector temporal patterns [17-19].\nIn driven resonators, PMI has only been investigated theoretically so far\n[20-22], but recent demonstrations of orthogonally-polarized dual comb\ngeneration in microresonators are sparking a renewed interest in this process\n[23]. In this Letter, we report on the direct experimental observation of PMI\nin a passive Kerr resonator. Our experimental test-bed is based on a normally\ndispersive fiber ring cavity that incorporates a polarization controller for\nadjustment of the intra-cavity birefringence. This localized birefringence\ngives rise to a relative phase detuning between the two orthogonal polarization\nmodes of the cavity, which in turn affects the frequency shift of the PMI\nsidebands. We also find that birefringence can lead to period-doubled (P2)\ndynamics, characterized by a two round-trip cycle. Our experimental results are\nin good agreement with theoretical predictions and numerical simulations based\non an iterative two-component Ikeda map. The experimental setup is displayed in\nFig. 1(a). It consists of a L = 12-m long passive fiber ring cavity with a\nfinesse F of about 27, mainly built out of spun fiber. To avoid competition\nwith scalar MI [2], we have built a cavity with normal group-velocity\ndispersion estimated to 2 = 47 ps 2 /km, a value large enough to neglect\nthird-order dispersion. Also, the use of a spun fiber (nearly isotropic) avoids\ngroup-velocity mismatch between the polarization components. Additionally, to\nprevent any additional source of bending-induced birefringence, the fiber was\ncarefully off-spooled and wound directly on our experimental board with a large\n50-cm diameter. We estimate that this causes a birefringence $\\Delta$n no\ngreater than 10 --8 [24], which can be neglected in our study.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Oct 2020 07:47:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-09"}

Systematic parametric simulations\nare conducted to understand the effect of difference in material properties\nbetween the two layers of a plate on the self-sustained flapping dynamics.

Yet, the extra\nflexibility afforded by adaptive P-spline models is obtained at the cost of a\nhigh computational burden, especially in a multidimensional setting.\nFurthermore, to the best of our knowledge, the literature lacks proposals for\nadaptive P-splines in more than two dimensions. Motivated by the need for\nanalysing data derived from experiments conducted to study neurons' activity in\nthe visual cortex, this work presents a novel locally adaptive anisotropic\nP-spline model in two (e.g., space) and three (space and time) dimensions.\nEstimation is based on the recently proposed SOP (Separation of Overlapping\nPrecision matrices) method, which provides the speed we look for. The practical\nperformance of the proposal is evaluated through simulations, and comparisons\nwith alternative methods are reported. In addition to the spatio-temporal\nanalysis of the data that motivated this work, we also discuss an application\nin two dimensions on the absenteeism of workers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Oct 2020 08:05:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2020 17:03:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-02"}

In the\nfirst stage, the agent starts on an easy terrain and the terrain difficulty is\ngradually increased, while forces derived from a target policy are applied to\nthe robot joints and the base. In the second stage, the guiding forces are\ngradually reduced to zero. Finally, in the third stage, random perturbations\nwith increasing magnitude are applied to the robot base, so the robustness of\nthe policies are improved. In simulation experiments, we show that our approach\nis effective in learning walking policies, separate from each other, for five\nterrain types: flat, hurdles, gaps, stairs, and steps. Moreover, we demonstrate\nthat in the absence of human demonstrations, a simple hand designed walking\ntrajectory is a sufficient prior to learn to traverse complex terrain types.

The simulation process usually involves mathematical formulation,\nnumerical discretization and iteration of discretized ordinary or partial\ndifferential equations depending on complexity of problems. In current work, we\ndevelop a data-driven model for extremely fast prediction of steady-state heat\nconduction of a hot object with arbitrary geometry in a two-dimensional space.\nMathematically, the steady-state heat conduction can be described by the\nLaplace's equation, where a heat (spatial) diffusion term dominates the\ngoverning equation. As the intensity of the heat diffusion only depends on the\ngradient of the temperature field, the temperature distribution of the\nsteady-state heat conduction displays strong features of locality. Therefore,\nin current approach the data-driven model is developed using convolution neural\nnetworks (CNNs), which is good at capturing local features (sub-invariant) thus\ncan be treated as numerical discretization in some sense. Furthermore, in our\nmodel, a signed distance function (SDF) is proposed to represent the geometry\nof the problem, which contains more information compared to a binary image. For\nthe training datasets, the hot objects are consisting of five simple\ngeometries: triangles, quadrilaterals, pentagons, hexagons and dodecagons. All\nthe geometries are different in size, shape, orientation and location. After\ntraining, the data-driven network model is able to accurately predict\nsteady-state heat conduction of hot objects with complex geometries which has\nnever been seen by the network model; and the prediction speed is three to four\norders faster than numerical simulation. According to the outstanding\nperformance of the network model, it is hoped that this approach can serve as a\nvaluable tool for applications of engineering optimization and design in\nfuture.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Oct 2020 09:15:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-09"}

This is a continuation of the work presented in [2] in\nwhich Large Eddy Simulation (LES) of co-current turbulent Taylor bubble flow\nwas presented. It was observed that one of the main challenges is the\nphysically accurate prediction of the behavior of the Taylor bubble skirt, and\nthe related bubble shedding. An underestimation of the turbulent fluctuations\nin the wake of the Taylor bubble was observed in the LES results. It was\nsuggested that this is related to over-prediction of the loss of void of the\nTaylor bubble due to bubble shedding induced by an LES mesh resolution which is\nnot sufficient to capture the break-up and bubble formation accurately. To\ncounter this, in the current work we present a DNS approach of co-current\nturbulent Taylor bubble flow called RK-Basilisk, based on the Basilisk code\nwith local adaptive grid refinement. This strategy allows for very high mesh\nresolution near the bubble's interface while elsewhere the grid is allowed to\nbe coarser. Each time step, the mesh is adapted based on a void fraction\ncriterion. Basilisk's underlying data structure which is based on an 'octree'\nallows for much faster solution procedures and, therefore, a much greater\nnumber of grid points as compared to the LES simulations which were performed\nusing the more general OpenFOAM code. We compare the results against\nexperimental data of the same setting, as well as the co-current LES OpenFOAM\nresults. The setting of turbulent Taylor bubble flow in co-current conditions\nallows for both lower order turbulence model development and the validation of\nmore general two-phase modeling strategies. Taylor bubble flow in itself also\nbears relevance to specific two-phase flow situations.

Many researchers have screened glaucoma by\nmeasuring cup-to-disc ratios from fundus and optical coherence tomography\nscans. However, this paper presents a novel strategy that pays attention to the\nRGC atrophy for screening glaucomatous pathologies and grading their severity.\nMethods: The proposed framework encompasses a hybrid convolutional network that\nextracts the retinal nerve fiber layer, ganglion cell with the inner plexiform\nlayer and ganglion cell complex regions, allowing thus a quantitative screening\nof glaucomatous subjects. Furthermore, the severity of glaucoma in screened\ncases is objectively graded by analyzing the thickness of these regions.\nResults: The proposed framework is rigorously tested on publicly available\nArmed Forces Institute of Ophthalmology (AFIO) dataset, where it achieved the\nF1 score of 0.9577 for diagnosing glaucoma, a mean dice coefficient score of\n0.8697 for extracting the RGC regions and an accuracy of 0.9117 for grading\nglaucomatous progression.

The meso-scale gradients that develop in these zones make wind farms\noperating in velocity fields that are rarely uniform. However, all existing\nwake-merging methods in engineering wind-farm wake models assume a homogeneous\nbackground velocity field in and around the farm, relying on a single\nwind-speed value usually measured several hundreds of meters upstream of the\nfirst row of turbines. In this study, we derive a new momentum-conserving\nwake-merging method capable of superimposing the waked flow on a heterogeneous\nbackground velocity field. We couple the proposed wake-merging method with four\ndifferent wake models, i.e. the Gaussian, super-Gaussian, double-Gaussian and\nIshihara model, and we test its performance against LES data, dual-Doppler\nradar measurements and SCADA data from the Horns Rev, London Array, and\nWestermost Rough farm.

The most accurate estimates are\nobtained when the wake-merging method is coupled with the double-Gaussian and\nGaussian single-wake model. The Ishihara model also shows good agreements with\nobservations. In contrast to this, the Jensen and super-Gaussian wake model\nunderestimate the farm power output for all wind speeds, wind directions and\nwind farms considered in our analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Oct 2020 10:05:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-02-15"}

The most rapidly rotating model\nexhibits a transient development of the low-$T/|W|$ instability with one-armed\nspiral flow at the early postbounce phase. Subsequently, the two-armed spiral\nflow appears, which persists during the simulation time. The moderately\nrotating model also shows the growth of the low-$T/|W|$ instability, but only\nwith the two-armed spiral flow. In the nonrotating model, a vigorous activity\nof the standing accretion-shock instability (SASI) is only observed. The SASI\nis first dominated by the sloshing mode, which is followed by the spiral SASI\nuntil the black hole formation. We present a spectrogram analysis of the\ngravitational waves (GWs) and neutrinos, focusing on the time correlation. Our\nresults show that characteristic time modulations in the GW and neutrino\nsignals can be linked to the growth of the non-axisymmetric instabilities. We\nfind that the degree of the protoneutron star (PNS) deformation, depending upon\nwhich modes of the non-axisymmetric instabilities develop, predominantly\naffects the characteristic frequencies of the correlated GW and neutrino\nsignals. We point out that these signals would be simultaneously detectable by\nthe current-generation detectors up to $\\sim10$ kpc. Our findings suggest that\nthe joint observation of GWs and neutrinos is indispensable for extracting\ninformation on the PNS evolution preceding the black hole formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Oct 2020 10:22:11 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2021 20:44:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}

In this study, a c++ starter project is\ndeveloped and made available, based on the meson build system, which provides\nnative support for software testing. It is used to show how a simple linear\nalgebra application, found in many scientific and academic applications, can be\ndeveloped and how simple unit, integration and system tests can be created that\nare managed through the meson build system. In this way, we are able to\nminimise software defects and reduce the risk to interpret incorrect data\ngenerated by erroneous software that may result in the wrong conclusions to be\ndrawn. Each layer of testing presents one additional layer of protection and we\nwill explore how these may be incorporated with minimum overhead to produce\nbug-free software.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Oct 2020 10:47:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-09"}

Recent theoretical studies on RDs with mass\nconservation (MCRDs) reported that the interfacial curvature between two states\ncontributes to the coarsening process, reminiscent of phase separation\nphenomena. However, since MCRDs do not presuppose a variational principle, it\nis largely unknown whether description of surface tension is operative or not.\nIn this study, we numerically and theoretically explore the coarsening process\nof patterns in MCRDs in two and three dimensions. We identify the parameter\nregions where the homogeneous steady state becomes stable, unstable, and\nmetastable. In the unstable region, pattern formation is triggered by usual\nTuring instability, whereas in the metastable region, nucleation-growth-type\npattern formation is observed. In the later stage, spherical droplet patterns\nare observed in both regions, where they obey a relation similar to the\nYoung-Laplace law and coarsen following the evaporation-condensation mechanism.\nThese results demonstrate that in the presence of a conserved variable, a\nphysical quantity similar to surface tension is relevant to MCRDs, which\nprovides new insight into molecular self-assembly driven by chemical reactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Oct 2020 11:01:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-16"}

The approach can be\ndirectly generalized to domains of any given dimensionality, and even to\nnon-smooth domains, but such generalizations are not considered here. The 2D-FC\nextensions are produced in a two-step procedure. In the first step the\none-dimensional Fourier Continuation method is applied along a discrete set of\noutward boundary-normal directions to produce, along such directions,\ncontinuations that vanish outside a narrow interval beyond the boundary. Thus,\nthe first step of the algorithm produces \"blending-to-zero along normals\" for\nthe given function values. In the second step, the extended function values are\nevaluated on an underlying Cartesian grid by means of an efficient, high-order\nboundary-normal interpolation scheme. A Fourier Continuation expansion of the\ngiven function can then be obtained by a direct application of the\ntwo-dimensional FFT algorithm. Algorithms of arbitrarily high order of accuracy\ncan be obtained by this method. The usefulness and performance of the proposed\ntwo-dimensional Fourier Continuation method are illustrated with applications\nto the Poisson equation and the time-domain wave equation within a bounded\ndomain.

In this paper we introduce a novel adaptive\nmetaheuristic algorithm to deal with Evolutionary Multitasking environments\ncoined as Adaptive Transfer-guided Multifactorial Cellular Genetic Algorithm\n(AT-MFCGA). AT-MFCGA relies on cellular automata to implement mechanisms in\norder to exchange knowledge among the optimization problems under\nconsideration. Furthermore, our approach is able to explain by itself the\nsynergies among tasks that were encountered and exploited during the search,\nwhich helps us to understand interactions between related optimization tasks. A\ncomprehensive experimental setup is designed to assess and compare the\nperformance of AT-MFCGA to that of other renowned evolutionary multitasking\nalternatives (MFEA and MFEA-II). Experiments comprise 11 multitasking scenarios\ncomposed of 20 instances of 4 combinatorial optimization problems, yielding the\nlargest discrete multitasking environment solved to date. Results are\nconclusive in regard to the superior quality of solutions provided by AT-MFCGA\nwith respect to the rest of the methods, which are complemented by a\nquantitative examination of the genetic transferability among tasks throughout\nthe search process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Oct 2020 12:00:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 3 May 2021 13:55:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-04"}

We show TD-errors\neffectively estimate a level's future learning potential and, when used to\nguide the sampling procedure, induce an emergent curriculum of increasingly\ndifficult levels. By adapting the sampling of training levels, PLR\nsignificantly improves sample efficiency and generalization on Procgen\nBenchmark--matching the previous state-of-the-art in test return--and readily\ncombines with other methods. Combined with the previous leading method, PLR\nraises the state-of-the-art to over 76% improvement in test return relative to\nstandard RL baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Oct 2020 12:46:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 2021 18:40:45 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 19 Jan 2021 19:45:12 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Sat, 12 Jun 2021 10:50:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-15"}

These samples show an angle-dependent\nmagnetoresistance behavior, which is consistent with the established spin Hall\nmagnetoresistance. In contrast, for the inverted layer sequence,\nY$_{3}$Fe$_{5}$O$_{12}$ thin films grown on Pt layers, Pt displays a finite\ninduced magnetic moment comparable to that of all-metallic Pt/Fe bilayers. This\nmagnetic moment is found to originate from finite intermixing at the\nY$_{3}$Fe$_{5}$O$_{12}$/Pt interface. As a consequence, we found a complex\nangle-dependent magnetoresistance indicating a superposition of the spin Hall\nand the anisotropic magnetoresistance in these type of samples. Both effects\ncan be disentangled from each other due to their different angle dependence and\ntheir characteristic temperature evolution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Oct 2020 13:54:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-01"}

For instance, EdgeCRF based on colour patches extracted\nfrom edges works effectively only when the presence of noise is insignificant,\nwhich is not the case for many real images; and, CRFNet, a recent method based\non fully supervised deep learning works only for the CRFs that are in the\ntraining data, and hence fail to deal with other possible CRFs beyond the\ntraining data. To address these problems, we introduce a non-deep-learning\nmethod using prediction consistency and gradual refinement. First, we rely more\non the patches of the input image that provide more consistent predictions. If\nthe predictions from a patch are more consistent, it means that the patch is\nlikely to be less affected by noise or any inferior colour combinations, and\nhence, it can be more reliable for CRF estimation. Second, we employ a gradual\nrefinement scheme in which we start from a simple CRF model to generate a\nresult which is more robust to noise but less accurate, and then we gradually\nincrease the model's complexity to improve the result. This is because a simple\nmodel, while being less accurate, overfits less to noise than a complex model\ndoes. Our experiments show that our method outperforms the existing\nsingle-image methods for daytime and nighttime real images. We further propose\na more efficient deep learning extension that performs test-time training\n(based on unsupervised losses) on the test input image.

A major practical challenge\nin the existing system identification methods is the undesirable dependency of\ntheir required sample size on the system dimension: roughly speaking, they\npresume and rely on sample sizes that scale linearly with respect to the system\ndimension. Evidently, in high-dimensional regime where the system dimension is\nlarge, it may be costly, if not impossible, to collect as many samples from the\nunknown system. In this paper, we will remedy this undesirable dependency on\nthe system dimension by introducing an $\\ell_1$-regularized estimation method\nthat can accurately estimate the Markov parameters of the system, provided that\nthe number of samples scale logarithmically with the system dimension.

We find that including only RWTs, steady state\nheat current and current fluctuations will be significantly suppressed at large\ntemperature bias, whereas they are strongly enhanced by considering CRWTs in\naddition. Furthermore, for the phonon statistics, the average phonon number and\ntwo-phonon correlation are nearly insensitive to strong qubit-phonon\nhybridization with only RWTs, whereas they will be dramatically cooled down via\nthe cooperative transitions based on CRWTs in addition. Therefore, CRWTs in\nquantum heat transfer system should be treated carefully.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Oct 2020 14:42:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-09"}

Targeting broadband channels, we consider the\njoint control of parameter allocation, sub-channel allocation, and transmission\npower to improve the performance of PARTEL. Specifically, the policies for\njoint SUbcarrier, Parameter, and POweR allocaTion (SUPPORT) are optimized under\nthe criterion of minimum learning latency. Two cases are considered. First, for\nthe case of decomposable models (e.g., logistic regression), the\nlatency-minimization problem is a mixed-integer program and non-convex. Due to\nits intractability, we develop a practical solution by integer relaxation and\ntransforming it into an equivalent convex problem of model size maximization\nunder a latency constraint. Thereby, a low-complexity algorithm is designed to\ncompute the SUPPORT policy. Second, consider the case of deep neural network\n(DNN) models which can be trained using PARTEL by introducing some auxiliary\nvariables.

Those either lack\na latent space in the autoregressive setting, such that a smooth exploration of\nthe compound space is not possible, or cannot generalize to varying chemical\ncompositions. We propose a new approach to efficiently generate molecular\nstructures that are not restricted to a fixed size or composition. Our model is\nbased on the variational autoencoder which learns a translation-, rotation-,\nand permutation-invariant low-dimensional representation of molecules. Our\nexperiments yield a mean reconstruction error below 0.05 Angstrom,\noutperforming the current state-of-the-art methods by a factor of four, and\nwhich is even lower than the spatial quantization error of most chemical\ndescriptors. The compositional and structural validity of newly generated\nmolecules has been confirmed by quantum chemical methods in a set of\nexperiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Oct 2020 13:04:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-14"}

Moreover, CNNs may suffer from overfitting when the\ndata is biased. We show that Bayesian-CNN can overcome these limitations by\nregularizing automatically and by quantifying the uncertainty. We have\ndeveloped a novel technique to utilize the uncertainties provided by the\nBayesian-CNN that significantly improves the performance on a large fraction of\nthe test data (about 6% improvement in accuracy on 77% of test data). Further,\nwe provide a novel explanation for the uncertainty by projecting the data into\na low dimensional space through a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique.\nThis dimensionality reduction enables interpretation of the test data through\nvisualization and reveals the structure of the data in a low dimensional\nfeature space. We show that the Bayesian-CNN can perform much better than the\nstate-of-the-art transfer learning CNN (TL-CNN) by reducing the false negative\nand false positive by 11% and 7.7% respectively for the present data set. It\nachieves this performance with only 1.86 million parameters as compared to\n134.33 million for TL-CNN. Besides, we modify the Bayesian-CNN by introducing a\nstochastic adaptive activation function. The modified Bayesian-CNN performs\nslightly better than Bayesian-CNN on all performance metrics and significantly\nreduces the number of false negatives and false positives (3% reduction for\nboth). We also show that these results are statistically significant by\nperforming McNemar's statistical significance test. This work shows the\nadvantages of Bayesian-CNN against the state-of-the-art, explains and utilizes\nthe uncertainties for histopathological images. It should find applications in\nvarious medical image classifications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Oct 2020 23:20:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 2 Sep 2021 19:55:12 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 5 Nov 2021 21:21:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-09"}

That allows us to calculate different physical quantities such as\nthe bulk modulus, Debye temperature, and critical transition temperature, from\nthe gradient and the curvature of the energy curve as a function of the lattice\nparameters.

Here, we\nreport the experimental observation of a on-chip micromechanical metamaterial\nas higher-order topological insulator for high-frequency mechanical waves.
