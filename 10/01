We present a scheme\nto create such plasma slabs, based on the propagation and collision in a gas\njet of two counter-propagating blast waves (BW). Each BW is launched by a\nsudden and local heating induced by a nanosecond laser beam that propagates\nalong the side of the jet. The resulting cylindrical BW expands perpendicular\nto the beam. The shock front, bent by the gas jet density gradient, pushes and\ncompresses the plasma toward the jet center. By using two parallel ns laser\nbeams, this scheme enables to tailor independently two opposite sides of the\njet, while avoiding the damage risks associated with counterpropagating laser\nbeams. A parametric study is performed using two and three dimensional\nhydrodynamic, as well as kinetic simulations. The BWs bending combined with the\ncollision in a stagnation regime increases the density by more than 10 times\nand generates a very thin (down to few microns), near to over-critical plasma\nslab with a high density contrast (> 100), and a lifetime of a few hundred\npicoseconds.

In spite of the induced defects,\nthe magnetic analysis present only a paramagnetic behavior with an\nantiferromagnetic coupling between the Mn ions. In the context of the bound\nmagnetic polaron theory, it is concluded that oxygen vacancies are not the\nnecessary defect to promote the desired ferromagnetic order at room\ntemperature.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Sep 2020 16:26:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-08"}

In essence, KD trains a smaller student model based on a larger\nteacher model and tries to retain the teacher model's level of performance as\nmuch as possible. However, existing KD methods suffer from the following\nlimitations. First, since the student model is smaller in absolute size, it\ninherently lacks model capacity. Second, the absence of an initial guide for\nthe student model makes it difficult for the student to imitate the teacher\nmodel to its fullest. Conventional KD methods yield low performance due to\nthese limitations. In this paper, we propose Pea-KD (Parameter-efficient and\naccurate Knowledge Distillation), a novel approach to KD. Pea-KD consists of\ntwo main parts: Shuffled Parameter Sharing (SPS) and Pretraining with Teacher's\nPredictions (PTP). Using this combination, we are capable of alleviating the\nKD's limitations. SPS is a new parameter sharing method that increases the\nstudent model capacity. PTP is a KD-specialized initialization method, which\ncan act as a good initial guide for the student.

To\nstudy the soft mode spectra, we employ time dependent Hartree-Fock whose\nresults are reproduced analytically via an effective sigma model description.\nWe find two different types of low-energy modes - (i) approximate Goldstone\nmodes associated with breaking an enlarged U(4)$\\times$U(4) symmetry and,\nsurprisingly, a set of (ii) nematic modes with non-zero angular momentum under\nthree-fold rotation. The modes of type (i) include true gapless Goldstone modes\nassociated with exact symmetries in addition to gapped \"pseudo-Goldstone\" modes\nassociated with approximate symmetries.

Most of the telescopes for space programs\nranging from Earth Observation to Astrophysics and covering all the\nelectromagnetic spectrum from X-rays to Far-Infrared are based on reflective\noptics. Mirrors operate in diverse and harsh environments that range from\nLow-Earth Orbit, to interplanetary orbits and the deep space. The operational\nlife of space observatories spans from minutes (sounding rockets) to decades\n(large observatories), and the performance of the mirrors within the optical\nsystem is susceptible to degrade, which results in a transient optical\nefficiency of the instrument. The degradation that occurs in space environments\ndepends on the operational life on the orbital properties of the space mission,\nand it reduces the total system throughput and hence compromises the science\nreturn. Therefore, the knowledge of potential degradation physical mechanisms,\nhow they affect mirror performance, and how to prevent it, is of paramount\nimportance to ensure the long-term success of space telescopes. In this review\nwe report an overview on current mirror technology for space missions with a\nparticular focus on the importance of degradation and radiation resistance of\nthe coating materials.

We compare their performance with various pooling matrices\nproposed in the literature, including 2D-pooling, P-BEST, and Tapestry, using\nthe two-stage definite defectives (DD) decoding algorithm. By conducting\nextensive simulations for a range of prevalence rates up to 5%, our numerical\nresults show that there is no pooling matrix with the lowest relative cost in\nthe whole range of the prevalence rates. To optimize the performance, one\nshould choose the right pooling matrix, depending on the prevalence rate. The\nfamily of PPoL matrices can dynamically adjust their column weights according\nto the prevalence rates and could be a better alternative than using a fixed\npooling matrix.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Sep 2020 19:05:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Jun 2021 13:51:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-16"}

One major\nchallenge these architectures face is the difficulty of handling uncertain\ntraffic demands using commercial optical circuit switches (OCS) with high\nswitching latency. Prior works have generally focused on developing\nfast-switching OCS prototypes to quickly react to traffic changes through\nfrequent reconfigurations. This approach, however, adds tremendous complexity\nto the control plane, and raises the barrier for commercial adoption of optical\ncircuit switched data center networks.\n  We propose COUDER, a robust topology and routing optimization framework for\nreconfigurable optical circuit switched data centers. COUDER optimizes topology\nand routing based on a convex set of traffic matrices, and offers strict\nthroughput guarantees for any future traffic matrices bounded by the convex\nset. For the bursty traffic demands that are unbounded by the convex set, we\nemploy a desensitization technique to reduce performance hit. This enables\nCOUDER to generate topology and routing solutions capable of handling\nunexpected traffic changes without relying on frequent topology\nreconfigurations. Our extensive evaluations based on Facebook's production DCN\ntraces show that, even with daily reconfiguration, COUDER achieves about 20\\%\nhigher throughput, and about 32\\% lower average hop count compared to\ncost-equivalent static topologies.

In addition to the set containment properties of the basic\nimmediate snapshot, a $k$-resilient immediate snapshot object requires that\neach set returned to a process contains at least $(n-k)$ pairs.\n  The paper first shows that, for $k,t<n-1$, $k$-resilient immediate snapshot\nis impossible in asynchronous read/write systems. %Then the paper investigates\nthe space of objects that %are impossible to solve in $n$-process $t$-crash\nread/write systems. Then the paper investigates a model of computation where\nthe processes communicate with each other by accessing $k$-immediate snapshot\nobjects, and shows that this model is stronger than the $t$-crash model.\nConsidering the space of $x$-set agreement problems (which are impossible to\nsolve in systems such that $x\\leq t$), the paper shows then that $x$-set\nagreement can be solved in read/write systems enriched with $k$-immediate\nsnapshot objects for $x=\\max(1,t+k-(n-2))$.

Hence, %thanks to the problem map it\nprovides, the paper establishes strong relations linking fundamental\ndistributed computing objects (one related to communication, the other to\nagreement), which are impossible to solve in pure read/write systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Sep 2020 20:22:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-02"}

However, 5G and Beyond will depart\nfrom this scheme, with the objective not only to provide services with higher\ndata rates. One of the main goals is to support massive machine-type\ncommunications (mMTC) in the IoT applications. Supporting massive uplink (UP)\ncommunications for devices with sporadic traffic pattern and short-packet size,\nas it is in many mMTC use cases, is a challenging task, particularly when the\ncontrol signaling is not negligible in size compared to the payload. Also,\nchannel estimation is challenging for sporadic and short-packet transmission\ndue to the limited number of employed pilots. In this paper, a new UP multiple\naccess (MA) scheme is proposed for mMTC, which can support a large number of\nuncoordinated IoT devices with short-packet and sporadic traffic. The proposed\nUP MA scheme removes the overheads associated with the device identifier as\nwell as pilots related to channel estimation. An alternative mechanism for\ndevice identification is proposed, where a unique spreading code is dedicated\nto each IoT device. This unique code is simultaneously used for the spreading\npurpose and device identification. Two IoT device identification algorithms\nwhich employ sparse signal reconstruction methods are proposed to determine the\nactive IoT devices prior to data detection. Specifically, the BIC model order\nselection method is employed to develop an IoT device identification algorithm\nfor unknown and time-varying probability of device activity. Our proposed MA\nscheme benefits from a non-coherent multiuser detection algorithm based on\nmachine learning to enable data detection without a priori knowledge on channel\nstate information. The effectiveness of the proposed MA scheme for known and\nunknown probability of activity is supported by simulation results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Sep 2020 20:32:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-02"}

This\nseries of tasks was first introduced in DCASE 2019 Task 3. In 2020, the sound\nevent localization and detection task introduces additional challenges in\nmoving sound sources and overlapping-event cases, which include two events of\nthe same type with two different direction-of-arrival (DoA) angles. In this\npaper, a novel event-independent network for polyphonic sound event\nlocalization and detection is proposed. Unlike the two-stage method we proposed\nin DCASE 2019 Task 3, this new network is fully end-to-end. Inputs to the\nnetwork are first-order Ambisonics (FOA) time-domain signals, which are then\nfed into a 1-D convolutional layer to extract acoustic features. The network is\nthen split into two parallel branches. The first branch is for sound event\ndetection (SED), and the second branch is for DoA estimation. There are three\ntypes of predictions from the network, SED predictions, DoA predictions, and\nevent activity detection (EAD) predictions that are used to combine the SED and\nDoA features for on-set and off-set estimation. All of these predictions have\nthe format of two tracks indicating that there are at most two overlapping\nevents. Within each track, there could be at most one event happening. This\narchitecture introduces a problem of track permutation. To address this\nproblem, a frame-level permutation invariant training method is used.\nExperimental results show that the proposed method can detect polyphonic sound\nevents and their corresponding DoAs.

We show the\ncooling history of a planet, which depends most significantly on planetary mass\nand age, can have a dominant effect on abundances in the visible atmosphere,\noften swamping trends one might expect based on Teq alone.

Quantitative\nsusceptibility mapping (QSM) derived from in vivo magnetic resonance imaging\n(MRI) is necessary to differentiate between iron content and mineralization. We\nset out to develop a deep learning-based segmentation method suitable for\nsegmenting both CMBs and iron deposits.

Cost-based query optimization\nchooses which algorithm to use based on several factors including the sort\norder of the input, input and output sizes, and the need for sorted output. For\nexample, hash-based aggregation is ideal for output smaller than the available\nmemory (e.g., TPC-H Query 1), whereas sorting the entire input and aggregating\nafter sorting are preferable when both aggregation input and output are large\nand the output needs to be sorted for a subsequent operation such as a merge\njoin.\n  Unfortunately, the size information required for a sound choice is often\ninaccurate or unavailable during query optimization, leading to sub-optimal\nalgorithm choices.

Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar\ntechnology is known to achieve high performance sensing by probing with\nmultiple orthogonal waveforms. However, implementing a low cost low power MIMO\nradar is challenging. One of the reasons for this difficulty stems from the\nincreased cost and power consumption required by analog-to-digital convertors\n(ADCs) in acquiring the multiple waveforms at the radar receiver. In this work\nwe study reduced cost MIMO radar receivers restricted to operate with low\nresolution ADCs. We design bit-limited MIMO radar (BiLiMO) receivers which are\ncapable of accurately recovering their targets while operating under strict\nresolution constraints. This is achieved by applying an additional analog\nfilter to the acquired waveforms, and designing the overall hybrid\nanalog-digital system to facilitate target identification using task-based\nquantization methods. In particular, we exploit the fact that the target\nparameters can be recovered from a compressed representation of the received\nwaveforms. We thus tune the acquisition system to recover this representation\nwith minimal distortion, from which the targets can be extracted in digital,\nand characterize the achievable error in identifying the targets.

Methods:\nWe performed a new membership analysis of the Lupus association based on\nastrometric and photometric data over a field of 160 deg2 around the main\nmolecular clouds of the complex and compared the properties of the various\nsubgroups in this region. Results: We identified 137 high-probability members\nof the Lupus association of young stars, including 47 stars that had never been\nreported as members before. Many of the historically known stars associated\nwith the Lupus region identified in previous studies are more likely to be\nfield stars or members of the adjacent Scorpius-Centaurus association. Our new\nsample of members covers the magnitude and mass range from G=8 to G=18 mag and\nfrom 0.03 to 2.4Msun, respectively. We compared the kinematic properties of the\nstars projected towards the molecular clouds Lupus 1 to 6 and showed that these\nsubgroups are located at roughly the same distance (about 160~pc) and move with\nthe same spatial velocity. Our age estimates inferred from stellar models show\nthat the Lupus subgroups are coeval (with median ages ranging from about 1 to 3\nMyr). The Lupus association appears to be younger than the population of young\nstars in the Corona-Australis star-forming region recently investigated by our\nteam using a similar methodology. The initial mass function of the Lupus\nassociation inferred from the distribution of spectral types shows little\nvariation compared to other star-forming regions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2020 07:40:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-18"}

Different from the generic image-to-image translation, drawing a\ncaricature automatically is a more challenging task due to the existence of\nvarious spacial deformations. Previous caricature generation methods are\nobsessed with predicting definite image warping from a given photo while\nignoring the intrinsic representation and distribution for exaggerations in\ncaricatures. This limits their ability on diverse exaggeration generation. In\nthis paper, we generalize the caricature generation problem from instance-level\nwarping prediction to distribution-level deformation modeling.

Technically, we propose a\nMulti-exaggeration Warper network to learn the distribution-level mapping from\nphoto to facial exaggerations. This makes it possible to generate diverse and\nreasonable exaggerations from randomly sampled warp codes given one input\nphoto. To better represent the facial exaggeration and produce fine-grained\nwarping, a deformation-field-based warping method is also proposed, which helps\nus to capture more detailed exaggerations than other point-based warping\nmethods.

Our review reveals that the configuration of the DE mutation\noperator differs depending on the source code of MOEA/D-DE. In our analysis, a\ntotal of 30 configurations (three index selection methods, two mutation\nstrategies, and five bound handling methods) are investigated on 16 MOPs with\nup to five objectives. Results show that each component significantly affects\nthe performance of MOEA/D-DE. We also present the most suitable configuration\nof the DE mutation operator, which maximizes the effectiveness of MOEA/D-DE.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2020 09:16:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-02"}

The high precision parallax data of the Gaia mission allows\nsignificant improvements in the distance determination to stellar clusters and\nits stars. In order to have accurate and precise distance determinations,\nsystematics like the parallax spatial correlations need to be accounted for,\nespecially for stars in small sky regions. Aims: Provide the astrophysical\ncommunity with a free and open code designed to simultaneously infer cluster\nparameters (i.e. distance and size) and the distances to its stars using Gaia\nparallax measurements. It includes cluster oriented prior families and is\nspecifically designed to deal with the Gaia parallax spatial correlations.\nMethods: A Bayesian hierarchical model is created to allow the inference of\nboth the cluster parameters and distances to its stars. Results: Using\nsynthetic data that mimics Gaia parallax uncertainties and spatial\ncorrelations, we observe that our cluster oriented prior families result in\ndistance estimates with smaller errors than those obtained with an\nexponentially decreasing space density prior. In addition, the treatment of the\nparallax spatial correlations minimizes errors in the estimated cluster size\nand stellar distances and avoids the underestimation of uncertainties. Although\nneglecting the parallax spatial correlations has no impact on the accuracy of\ncluster distance determinations, it underestimates the uncertainties and may\nresult in measurements that are incompatible with the true value. Conclusions:\nThe combination of prior knowledge with the treatment of Gaia parallax spatial\ncorrelations produces accurate (error <10%) and trustworthy estimates (i.e.\ntrue values contained within the 2$\\sigma$ uncertainties) of clusters distances\nfor clusters up to ~5 kpc, and cluster sizes for clusters up to ~1 kpc.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2020 09:32:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-25"}

Whilst the ability to\ncollect data from ground based observation sites and satellites has grown, the\nmemory bound nature of the code has proved a limitation in modelling problem\nsizes required by modern science. In this paper we describe work replacing the\nbespoke, sequential, eigen-solver with that of the SLEPc package for solving\nthe system of normal equations. This work had a dual purpose, to break through\nthe memory limit of the code, and thus support the modelling of much larger\nsystems, by supporting execution on distributed machines, and to improve\nperformance. But when adopting SLEPc it was not just the solving of the normal\nequations, but also fundamentally how we build and distribute the data\nstructures. We describe an approach for building symmetric matrices in a way\nthat provides good load balance and avoids the need for close co-ordination\nbetween processes or replication of work. We also study the memory bound nature\nof the code and combine detailed profiling with software cache prefetching to\nsignificantly optimise. Performance and scaling are explored on ARCHER, a Cray\nXC30, where we achieve a speed up for the solver of 294 times by replacing the\nmodel's bespoke approach with SLEPc.

Apart from\ntheir scientific merit, these models are often used to inform political\ndecisions and intervention measures during an ongoing outbreak. However,\nreliably inferring the dynamics of ongoing outbreaks by connecting complex\nmodels to real data is still hard and requires either laborious manual\nparameter fitting or expensive optimization methods which have to be repeated\nfrom scratch for every application of a given model. In this work, we address\nthis problem with a novel combination of epidemiological modeling with\nspecialized neural networks. Our approach entails two computational phases: In\nan initial training phase, a mathematical model describing the epidemic is used\nas a coach for a neural network, which acquires global knowledge about the full\nrange of possible disease dynamics. In the subsequent inference phase, the\ntrained neural network processes the observed data of an actual outbreak and\ninfers the parameters of the model in order to realistically reproduce the\nobserved dynamics and reliably predict future progression. With its flexible\nframework, our simulation-based approach is applicable to a variety of\nepidemiological models. Moreover, since our method is fully Bayesian, it is\ndesigned to incorporate all available prior knowledge about plausible parameter\nvalues and returns complete joint posterior distributions over these\nparameters. Application of our method to the early Covid-19 outbreak phase in\nGermany demonstrates that we are able to obtain reliable probabilistic\nestimates for important disease characteristics, such as generation time,\nfraction of undetected infections, likelihood of transmission before symptom\nonset, and reporting delays using a very moderate amount of real-world\nobservations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2020 11:01:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 2020 13:54:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 12:32:25 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 2 Nov 2021 11:09:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-17"}

A two bed 20min/position acquisition was\nperformed on a 550ps- and on a 320ps- TOF-PET/CT and reconstructed with\nstandard FDG reconstruction parameters, without and with additional filtering.\nThe whole procedure was repeated on both PET after adding a 300ml of water\n(50Gy setup).

Due to\nlimited prior knowledge, economists began researching this issue using\ncost-benefit analysis and found that infection control processes significantly\naffect economic efficiency. A UK study used economic parameters to numerically\ndemonstrate an optimal balance in the process, including keeping the infected\npopulation stationary. However, universally applicable knowledge, which is\nindispensable for the guiding principles of infection control, has not yet been\nclearly developed because of the methodological limitations of simulation\nstudies. Here, we propose a simple model and theoretically prove the universal\nresult of economic irreversibility by applying the idea of thermodynamics to\npandemic control. This means that delaying infection control measures is more\nexpensive than implementing infection control measures early while keeping\ninfected populations stationary. This implies that once the infected population\nincreases, society cannot return to its previous state without extra\nexpenditures. This universal result is analytically obtained by focusing on the\ninfection-spreading phase of pandemics, and is applicable not just to COVID-19,\nregardless of \"herd immunity.\" It also confirms the numerical observation of\nstationary infected populations in its optimally efficient process.

Weak\ngravitational lensing allows us to constrain these halo shapes and thereby test\nthe nature of dark matter. Weak lensing has already provided robust detections\nof the signature of halo flattening at the mass scales of groups and clusters,\nwhereas results for galaxies have been somewhat inconclusive. Here we combine\ndata from five surveys (NGVSLenS, KiDS/KV450, CFHTLenS, CS82, and RCSLenS) in\norder to tighten observational constraints on galaxy-scale halo ellipticity for\nphotometrically selected lens samples. We constrain $f_\\rm{h}$, the average\nratio between the aligned component of the halo ellipticity and the ellipticity\nof the light distribution, finding $f_\\rm{h}=0.303^{+0.080}_{-0.079}$ for red\nlenses and $f_\\rm{h}=0.217^{+0.160}_{-0.159}$ for blue lenses when assuming\nelliptical NFW density profiles and a linear scaling between halo ellipticity\nand galaxy ellipticity. Our constraints for red galaxies constitute the\ncurrently most significant ($3.8\\sigma$) systematics-corrected detection of the\nsignature of halo flattening at the mass scale of galaxies. Our results are in\ngood agreement with expectations from the Millennium Simulation that apply the\nsame analysis scheme and incorporate models for galaxy-halo misalignment.\nAssuming these misalignment models and the analysis assumptions stated above\nare correct, our measurements imply an average dark matter halo ellipticity for\nthe studied red galaxy samples of $\\langle|\\epsilon_\\rm{h}|\\rangle=0.174\\pm\n0.046$, where $|\\epsilon_{h}|=(1-q)/(1+q)$ relates to the ratio $q=b/a$ of the\nminor and major axes of the projected mass distribution.

It was designed for ultra-high radial-velocity precision and\nextreme spectral fidelity with the aim of performing exoplanet research and\nfundamental astrophysical experiments with unprecedented precision and\naccuracy. It is able to observe with any of the four Unit Telescopes (UT) of\nthe VLT at a spectral resolving power of 140,000 or 190,000 over the 378.2 to\n788.7 nm wavelength range, or with all UTs together, turning the VLT into a\n16-m diameter equivalent telescope in terms of collecting area, while still\nproviding a resolving power of 70,000. We provide a general description of the\nESPRESSO instrument, report on the actual on-sky performance, and present our\nGuaranteed-Time Observation (GTO) program with its first results. ESPRESSO was\ninstalled on the Paranal Observatory in fall 2017. Commissioning (on-sky\ntesting) was conducted between December 2017 and September 2018. The instrument\nsaw its official start of operations on October 1st, 2018, but improvements to\nthe instrument and re-commissioning runs were conducted until July 2019. The\nmeasured overall optical throughput of ESPRESSO at 550 nm and a seeing of 0.65\narcsec exceeds the 10% mark under nominal astro-climatic conditions. We\ndemonstrate a radial-velocity precision of better than 25 cm/s during one night\nand 50 cm/s over several months. These values being limited by photon noise and\nstellar jitter show that the performanceis compatible with an instrumental\nprecision of 10 cm/s. No difference has been measured across the UTs neither in\nthroughput nor RV precision. The combination of the large collecting telescope\narea with the efficiency and the exquisite spectral fidelity of ESPRESSO opens\na new parameter space in RV measurements, the study of planetary atmospheres,\nfundamental constants, stellar characterisation and many other fields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2020 11:53:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-27"}

As proposed by Zhang et al. (2018), the energy\ncorrelations can be utilized to distinguish these kinds of gamma-ray bursts in\nthe plane of bolometric fluence versus peak energy as well. Interestingly, the\npeculiar short GRB 170817A belongs to the E-I group in the fluence versus peak\nenergy plane, but it is an outlier of both Amati and Yonetoku relations even\nthough the off-axis effect has been corrected. Furthermore, we compare the\nradiation features between the extended emissions and the prompt gamma-rays in\norder to search for their possible connections. Taking into account all these\nfactors, we conclude that gamma-ray bursts with extended emission are still\nrequired to model with dichotomic groups, namely E-I and E-II classes,\nrespectively, which hints that they might be of different origins.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2020 12:11:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-30"}

Using finite elements of appropriate orders in\nspace and time for trial and test spaces, this setting is known to be\nequivalent to a Crank--Nicolson time-stepping scheme for parabolic problems.\nDifferences to existing methods are detailed.\n  We show numerical comparisons with time-stepping methods. The space-time\nmethod shows good stability properties and requires fewer degrees of freedom in\ntime to reach the same accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2020 12:21:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Oct 2020 14:10:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 5 Dec 2022 16:52:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-06"}

The natural question\nis to check if $\\sigma$ appears in $\\pi$, and if so count the number of\noccurrences. We know that for any fixed length~k, we can check if a given\npattern of length k appears in a permutation of length n in time linear in n,\nbut being able to count all such occurrences in $f(k)\\cdot n^{o(k/\\log k)}$\ntime would refute the exponential time hypothesis (ETH). This motivates a\nsystematic study of the complexity of counting occurrences for different\npatterns of fixed small length k. We investigate this question for k=4. Very\nrecently, Even-Zohar and Leng [arXiv 2019] identified two types of 4-patterns.\nFor the first type they designed an $\\~O(n)$ time algorithm, while for the\nsecond they were able to provide an $\\~O(n^{1.5})$ time algorithm. This brings\nup the question whether the permutations of the second type are inherently\nharder than the first type.\n  We establish a connection between counting 4-patterns of the second type and\ncounting 4-cycles in a sparse undirected graph. By designing two-way reductions\nwe show that the complexities of both problems are the same, up to\npolylogarithmic factors. This allows us to provide a reasonable argument for\nwhy there is a difference in the complexities for counting 4-patterns of the\ntwo types. In particular, even for the simpler problem of detecting a 4-cycle\nin a graph on m edges, the best known algorithm works in $O(m^{4/3})$ time. Our\nreductions imply that an $O(n^{4/3-\\varepsilon})$ time algorithm for counting\noccurrences would imply an exciting breakthrough for counting (and hence also\ndetecting) 4-cycles. In the other direction, by plugging in the fastest known\nalgorithm for counting 4-cycles, we obtain an algorithm for counting\noccurrences of any 4-pattern in $O(n^{1.48})$ time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2020 12:25:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-02"}

In this paper, we propose an Answer-Driven Visual\nState Estimator (ADVSE) to impose the effects of different answers on visual\nstates. First, we propose an Answer-Driven Focusing Attention (ADFA) to capture\nthe answer-driven effect on visual attention by sharpening question-related\nattention and adjusting it by answer-based logical operation at each turn. Then\nbased on the focusing attention, we get the visual state estimation by\nConditional Visual Information Fusion (CVIF), where overall information and\ndifference information are fused conditioning on the question-answer state. We\nevaluate the proposed ADVSE to both question generator and guesser tasks on the\nlarge-scale GuessWhat?! dataset and achieve the state-of-the-art performances\non both tasks. The qualitative results indicate that the ADVSE boosts the agent\nto generate highly efficient questions and obtains reliable visual attentions\nduring the reasonable question generation and guess processes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2020 12:46:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 24 Mar 2022 12:55:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-03-25"}

This problem arises in many audio signal processing\napplications which operate on a short-time Fourier transform magnitude or power\nspectrogram, and discard the phase information. Recovering the missing phase\nfrom the resulting modified spectrogram is indeed necessary in order to\nsynthesize time-domain signals. PR is commonly addressed by considering a\nminimization problem involving a quadratic loss function. In this paper, we\nadopt a different standpoint. Indeed, the quadratic loss does not properly\naccount for some perceptual properties of audio, and alternative discrepancy\nmeasures such as beta-divergences have been preferred in many settings.\nTherefore, we formulate PR as a new minimization problem involving Bregman\ndivergences. Since these divergences are not symmetric with respect to their\ntwo input arguments in general, they lead to two different formulations of the\nproblem. To optimize the resulting objective, we derive two algorithms based on\naccelerated gradient descent and alternating direction method of multipliers.\nExperiments conducted on audio signal recovery from spectrograms that are\neither exact or estimated from noisy observations highlight the potential of\nour proposed methods for audio restoration.

The need\nto acquire and process each scan in a short time naturally leads to trade-offs\nbetween speed and reconstruction quality, creating a need for fast\nreconstruction algorithms capable of creating accurate reconstructions from\nlimited data.\n  In this paper we introduce the Neural Network Feldkamp-Davis-Kress (NN-FDK)\nalgorithm. This algorithm adds a machine learning component to the FDK\nalgorithm to improve its reconstruction accuracy while maintaining its\ncomputational efficiency. Moreover, the NN-FDK algorithm is designed such that\nit has low training data requirements and is fast to train. This ensures that\nthe proposed algorithm can be used to improve image quality in high throughput\nCT scanning settings, where FDK is currently used to keep pace with the\nacquisition speed using readily available computational resources.\n  We compare the NN-FDK algorithm to two standard CT reconstruction algorithms\nand to two popular deep neural networks trained to remove reconstruction\nartifacts from the 2D slices of an FDK reconstruction. We show that the NN-FDK\nreconstruction algorithm is substantially faster in computing a reconstruction\nthan all the tested alternative methods except for the standard FDK algorithm\nand we show it can compute accurate CCB CT reconstructions in cases of high\nnoise, a low number of projection angles or large cone angles. Moreover, we\nshow that the training time of an NN-FDK network is orders of magnitude lower\nthan the considered deep neural networks, with only a slight reduction in\nreconstruction accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2020 14:10:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-02"}

However, despite the remarkable similarity to the\nNewtonian KHI temporal interface dynamics, the elastic KHI reveals\nqualitatively different instability mechanism. Indeed, the velocity difference\nacross the interface strongly fluctuates and non-monotonically varies in time\ndue to energy pumping by elastic waves, detected in the flow. A correlation of\nthe elastic wave intensity and efficiency of the elastic KHI in different\nregimes suggests that the competition between the destabilizing factor of the\nelastic waves and the stabilizing effect of the elastic stress difference\ngenerated by the velocity difference at the interface is the novel instability\nmechanism of the elastic KHI.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2020 14:24:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-15"}

We first quantify its global statistical\nsignificance, by combining the results from relevant neutrino oscillation\nexperiments. As the hint is indirect, other new physics apart from three\nmassive neutrinos could be present, masking the results as direct leptonic CP\nviolation has not yet been conclusively observed. Thus, we move on to checking\nthe robustness of the hint against the framework in which the experimental data\nis interpreted; in other words, its physical origin. To that purpose, we\nconfront with data the scenario that is less bounded by other experiments:\nneutral current Non-Standard Interactions (NSI) among neutrinos and matter. In\nthe end, CP violation induced by neutrino masses and leptonic mixing is found\nto be quite robust, due to the large amount of neutrino flavour transition data\ncollected along three decades.\n  Nevertheless, the next generation LBL accelerator experiments are aimed at\nprecision measurements that could be more severely affected.

In actual engineer, the system can only converge\nto a small neighborhood near the equilibrium point because of the existence of\nuncertainty i.e. x_e \\to 0. The actual equilibrium point should be deduced by\ntaking the limit but not directly solve the equilibrium point. Hence, the\nactual selection of exponential term is suggested to be not 1 to make system\nconvergence to the equilibrium point within predefined time. 2). On\nsingularity-avoidance: Based on the exponential feature of predefined-time\nstability systems, a mathematic concept of switching sliding mode\n\\cite{su1994adaptive} is applied in the design of nonsingular predefined-time\nterminal sliding mode. However, this class of sliding mode switching method\nwill cause a singular problem, which can be described as control input u \\to\n\\infty if the system state x \\to 0 and any-order time derivative of x is not 0.\nHence, a non-singular selection condition for each recursive sliding mode\nsurface is explored in this paper to realize the global finiteness of control\ninput. In addition, an unnecessary chattering of control input will also be\ncaused by the sliding mode switching frequency, and a novel switching condition\nwill be applied in the controller to reduce this chattering. Simulations will\nbe carried out to validate the effect of the novel nonsingular predefined-time\nsliding mode control method to some extent.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2020 14:44:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 6 Oct 2020 12:05:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-07"}

Given\nthat modern front-end amplifiers for the GBT and direct Local Oscillator\ninjection for the 30 m telescope provide smooth pass bands that are a few tens\nof megahertz in width, the spectra from standard observations can be cleaned\n(baseline removal) separately and then co-added directly when the lines are\nnarrow enough (a few km/s), instead of performing the traditional ON minus OFF\ndata reduction.

For\nthe non-homogeneous case, given the complexity of the stochastic process, and\nin the same spirit as the well-studied SIS models, we use a mean-field type\napproximation to obtain a discrete-time dynamical system for the finite memory\ninteracting P\\'{o}lya contagion network. Interestingly, for $M=1$, we obtain a\nlinear dynamical system which exactly represents the corresponding Markov\nprocess. For $M>1$, we use mean-field approximation to obtain a nonlinear\ndynamical system. Furthermore, noting that the latter dynamical system admits a\nlinear variant (realized by retaining its leading linear terms), we study the\nasymptotic behavior of the linear systems for both memory modes and\ncharacterize their equilibrium. Finally, we present simulation studies to\nassess the quality of the approximation purveyed by the linear and non-linear\ndynamical systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2020 14:58:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Nov 2021 00:35:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 21 Dec 2021 02:27:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-22"}

The distances to the remaining galaxies lie within this range.\nLow-metallicity galaxies have been identified by measuring the color indices of\nthe red giant branch: AGC102728, AGC198691, AGC205590, AGC223231, AGC731921,\nand AGC747826. We have determined the distance to AGC198691 with a record low\nmetallicity. Since AGC223254, AGC229053, AGC229379, AGC238890, AGC731921, and\nAGC742601 are projected onto the Virgo cluster of galaxies, the distances\nestimated by us together with the velocities of these galaxies measured\npreviously at Arecibo can be used to refine the effect of galaxy infall to the\nVirgo cluster.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2020 15:17:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-07"}

It is unclear, however, how gas\naccretion onto growing planets influences the shape and depth of their growing\ngaps. We performed isothermal hydrodynamical simulations with the Fargo-2D1D\ncode, which assumes planets accreting gas within full discs that range from 0.1\nto 260 AU. The gas accretion routine uses a sink cell approach, in which\ndifferent accretion rates are used to cope with the broad range of gas\naccretion rates cited in the literature. We find that the planetary gas\naccretion rate increases for larger disc aspect ratios and greater viscosities.\nOur main results show that gas accretion has an important impact on the\ngap-opening mass: we find that when the disc responds slowly to a change in\nplanetary mass (i.e., at low viscosity), the gap-opening mass scales with the\nplanetary accretion rate, with a higher gas accretion rate resulting in a\nlarger gap-opening mass. On the other hand, if the disc response time is short\n(i.e., at high viscosity), then gas accretion helps the planet carve a deep\ngap. As a consequence, higher planetary gas accretion rates result in smaller\ngap-opening masses. Our results have important implications for the derivation\nof planet masses from disc observations: depending on the planetary gas\naccretion rate, the derived masses from ALMA observations might be off by up to\na factor of two. We discuss the consequences of the change in the gap-opening\nmass on the evolution of planetary systems based on the example of the grand\ntack scenario. Planetary gas accretion also impacts stellar gas accretion,\nwhere the influence is minimal due to the presence of a gas-accreting planet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2020 15:24:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 29 Nov 2020 09:19:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-04"}

A key question is\nwhether this can be improved using machine learning to complement the\nactivities of petrophysicists searching for hydrocarbons.

We explore how the\npredictions from these models compare against the interpretations of human\npetrophysicists, along with numerous options and techniques that were used to\noptimise the prediction of our models. The power provided by modern\nsupercomputers such as Cray machines is crucial here, but some popular machine\nlearning framework are unable to take full advantage of modern HPC machines. As\nsuch we will also explore the suitability of the machine learning tools we have\nused, and describe steps we took to work round their limitations. The result of\nthis work is the ability, for the first time, to use machine learning for the\nentire petrophysical workflow.

Occupant tracking has been used in the public safety, energy\nconservation, and marketing fields. Various methods have been demonstrated\nwhich can track people outside of and inside buildings; including GPS,\nvisual-based tracking using surveillance cameras, and vibration-based tracking\nusing sensors such as accelerometers. In this work, those main systems for\ntracking occupants are compared and contrasted for the levels of detail they\ngive about where occupants are, as well as their respective privacy concerns\nand how identifiable the tracking information collected is to a specific\nperson. We discuss a case study using vibrations sensors mounted in Virginia\nTech's Goodwin Hall that was recently conducted, demonstrating that similar\nlevels of accuracy in occupant localization can be achieved to current methods,\nand highlighting the amount of identifying information in the vibration signals\ndataset. Finally, a method of transforming the vibration data to preserve\noccupant privacy was proposed and tested on the dataset. The results indicate\nthat our proposed method has successfully resulted in anonymizing the\noccupant's gender information which was previously identifiable from the\nvibration data, while minimally impacting the localization accuracy achieved\nwithout anonymization.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 30 Sep 2020 23:33:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-15"}

Conveniently, the corresponding generalized\nfriction coefficients can be pre-computed and subsequently re-used to solve\ndynamic equations of motion fast. This framework extends Lagrangian mechanics\nof dissipative systems to active surfaces and active microswimmers, whose shape\ndynamics is driven by internal forces.

Crucially, microcombs offer the prospect of fully\nintegrated miniaturized optical systems with unprecedented reductions in cost,\nsize, weight, and power. However, this goal has been consistently hindered by\nthe use of bulk free-space and fiber-optic components to process microcombs,\nlimiting form factors to the table-top. Here, we address this challenge by\nintroducing an integrated photonics interposer architecture to process\nmicrocombs and replace discrete components. Taking microcomb-based optical\nfrequency synthesis in the telecom C-band around 1550 nm as our target\napplication, we develop an interposer architecture that collects, routes, and\ninterfaces octave-wide optical signals between photonic chiplets and\nheterogeneously integrated devices that constitute the synthesizer. We have\nimplemented the octave spanning spectral filtering of a microcomb, central to\nthe interposer, in the popular silicon nitride photonic platform, and have\nconfirmed the requisite performance of the individual elements of the\ninterposer. Moreover, we show that the thick silicon nitride needed for bright\ndissipative Kerr soliton generation can be integrated with the comparatively\nthin silicon nitride interposer layer through octave-bandwidth adiabatic\nevanescent coupling, indicating a path towards future system-level\nconsolidation. Our interposer architecture addresses the immediate need for\non-chip microcomb processing to successfully miniaturize microcomb systems. As\nmicrocombs and integrated devices evolve, our approach can be readily adapted\nto other metrology-grade applications based on optical atomic clocks and\nhigh-precision navigation and spectroscopy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2020 00:14:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-20"}
