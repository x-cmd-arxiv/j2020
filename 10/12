This paper\nconcentrates specifically on this last aspect. Common examples of non\ntraditional Big Data sources are represented by crowdsourcing (data voluntarily\ncollected by individuals) and web scraping (data extracted from websites and\nreshaped in a structured dataset). A common characteristic to these\nunconventional data collections is the lack of any precise statistical sample\ndesign, a situation described in statistics as 'convenience sampling'. As it is\nwell known, in these conditions no probabilistic inference is possible. To\novercome this problem, Arbia et al. (2018) proposed the use of a special form\nof post-stratification (termed 'post-sampling'), with which data are\nmanipulated prior their use in an inferential context.

We thus suggest an\nMSE-correction operational strategy.

The nature of dark energy is yet unknown. Several models of dark\nenergy have been proposed: a non zero cosmological constant, a potential energy\nof some self interacting scalar field, effects related to the non homogeneous\ndistribution of matter, or effects due to alternative theories of gravity.\nRecently, it turned out that the standard flat LambdaCDM is disfavored (at 4\nsigma) when confronted with a high redshift Hubble diagram, consisting of\nsupernovae of type Ia (SNIa), quasars (QSOs) and gamma ray-bursts (GRBs)\n([1-3]).

While it\nis traditionally thought to govern the formation and (with)holding of beliefs,\nepistemic rationality may also apply to the interrogative attitudes associated\nwith our core epistemic practice of inquiry, such as wondering, investigating,\nand curiosity. Since generally intelligent systems should be capable of\nrational inquiry, AI researchers have a natural interest in the norms that\ngovern interrogative attitudes. Following its recent coinage, we use the term\n\"zetetic\" to refer to the properties and norms associated with the capacity to\ninquire. In this paper, we argue that zetetic norms can be modeled via\ndefeasible inferences to and from questions---a.k.a erotetic inferences---in a\nmanner similar to the way norms of epistemic rationality are represented by\ndefeasible inference rules. We offer a sequent calculus that accommodates the\nunique features of \"erotetic defeat\" and that exhibits the computational\nproperties needed to inform the design of zetetic agents. The calculus\npresented here is an improved version of the one presented in Millson (2019),\nextended to cover a new class of defeasible erotetic inferences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Oct 2020 17:39:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-13"}

To\nextract global information, one usually needs a large window size, a large\nnumber of layers, and/or a large number of channels. This can often\nsignificantly increase the computational cost. In this work, we present a novel\nneural network layer that directly incorporates long-range information for a\npoint cloud. This layer, dubbed the long-range convolutional (LRC)-layer,\nleverages the convolutional theorem coupled with the non-uniform Fourier\ntransform. In a nutshell, the LRC-layer mollifies the point cloud to an\nadequately sized regular grid, computes its Fourier transform, multiplies the\nresult by a set of trainable Fourier multipliers, computes the inverse Fourier\ntransform, and finally interpolates the result back to the point cloud. The\nresulting global all-to-all convolution operation can be performed in\nnearly-linear time asymptotically with respect to the number of input points.\nThe LRC-layer is a particularly powerful tool when combined with local\nconvolution as together they offer efficient and seamless treatment of both\nshort and long range interactions. We showcase this framework by introducing a\nneural network architecture that combines LRC-layers with short-range\nconvolutional layers to accurately learn the energy and force associated with a\n$N$-body potential. We also exploit the induced two-level decomposition and\npropose an efficient strategy to train the combined architecture with a reduced\nnumber of samples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Oct 2020 17:42:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-13"}

It was found that the prey can survive\nwith non-zero probability, if $p>p_c$ with $p_c<1$.

Historical\nliterature reports the spreading half angle is approximately 6$^{\\circ}$ in\nzero-pressure gradient flows regardless of Reynolds number and roughness shape.\nRecent simulations and experiments have sought to explain the lateral-spreading\nmechanism and have observed high- and low-speed streaks along the flanks of the\nwedge that appear central to the spreading process. To better elucidate the\nroles of Reynolds number and of streaks, a naphthalene flow-visualization\nsurvey and hotwire measurements are conducted over a wider range of Reynolds\nnumbers and longer streamwise domain than previous experiments. The naphthalene\nresults show that, while the mean spreading angle is consistent with the\nhistorical literature, there may be a weak dependency on $x$-based Reynolds\nnumber, which emerges as a result of the large sample size of the survey. The\ndistance between the roughness element and the wedge origin exhibits a clear\ntrend with the roughness-height-based Reynolds number.

They are widely used in various applications, such as\nrecommendation, fraud detection, and search. In these domains, the graphs are\ntypically large, containing hundreds of millions of nodes and several billions\nof edges. To tackle this challenge, we develop DistDGL, a system for training\nGNNs in a mini-batch fashion on a cluster of machines. DistDGL is based on the\nDeep Graph Library (DGL), a popular GNN development framework. DistDGL\ndistributes the graph and its associated data (initial features and embeddings)\nacross the machines and uses this distribution to derive a computational\ndecomposition by following an owner-compute rule. DistDGL follows a synchronous\ntraining approach and allows ego-networks forming the mini-batches to include\nnon-local nodes. To minimize the overheads associated with distributed\ncomputations, DistDGL uses a high-quality and light-weight min-cut graph\npartitioning algorithm along with multiple balancing constraints. This allows\nit to reduce communication overheads and statically balance the computations.\nIt further reduces the communication by replicating halo nodes and by using\nsparse embedding updates. The combination of these design choices allows\nDistDGL to train high-quality models while achieving high parallel efficiency\nand memory scalability. We demonstrate our optimizations on both inductive and\ntransductive GNN models. Our results show that DistDGL achieves linear speedup\nwithout compromising model accuracy and requires only 13 seconds to complete a\ntraining epoch for a graph with 100 million nodes and 3 billion edges on a\ncluster with 16 machines.

Near the crossover between crystal and fluid ground state energies, the\nargument is quite general and valid for practically any quantum transition\nbetween a crystal and a more amorphous phase. In this regime, the colloid is a\ngel and its \"Goldstone\" modes are flows of irregular fluid droplets separated\nby crystalline walls. A metal insulator transition occurs when a single bubble\nof fluid spans the entire system. Beyond this transition the colloid is a sol\nand its properties depend on the existence of meta-stable finite crystallites\nwith negative surface tension. If these exist, the sol phase has lower energy\nthan the homogeneous fluid. In the two dimensional HEF, Kivelson and Spivak\nargued that such negative surface tension objects always exist, at least in the\nform of stripes. We argue that the existence of stripes also implies the\nexistence of finite negative tension elliptical crystallites and the detailed\ncompetition between the finite crystallite phase and striped phases is\ndifficult to calculate. We also provide weaker arguments that finite\ncrystallites exist in three dimensions. This provides evidence for our claim\nthat the gapless excitations at non-zero wavenumber, observed in the numerical\ncalculations of\\cite{haule}\\cite{gapless} are quantum remnants of these\ncrystallites (Bosonic quasi-particles) in the limit of vanishing surface\ntension.

Methods extracting causal information from\nconditional independencies between variables of a system are common tools for\nthis purpose, but are limited in the lack of independencies. To surmount this\nlimitation, we capitalize on the fact that the laws governing the generative\nmechanisms of a system often result in substructures embodied in the generative\nfunctional equation of a variable, which act as sufficient statistics for the\ninfluence that other variables have on it. These functional sufficient\nstatistics constitute intermediate hidden variables providing new conditional\nindependencies to be tested.

It is also a candidate key\nparameter in improving the utility of SNe Ia for cosmological distance\ndeterminations. Here we study the velocity distribution of a sample of 311 SNe\nIa from the kaepora database. The velocities are derived from the Si II\n$\\lambda$6355 absorption line in optical spectra measured at (or extrapolated\nto) the time of peak brightness. We statistically show that the observed\nvelocity has a bimodal Gaussian distribution consisting of two groups of SNe\nIa: Group I with a lower but narrower scatter ($\\mu_1 = 11000 \\text{km\ns}^{-1}$, $\\sigma_1 = 700 \\text{km s}^{-1}$), and Group II with a higher but\nbroader scatter ($\\mu_2 = 12300 \\text{km s}^{-1}$, $\\sigma_2 = 1800 \\text{km\ns}^{-1}$). The population ratio of Group I to Group II is 201:110 (65%:35%).\nThere is substantial degeneracy between the two groups, but for SNe Ia with\nvelocity $v > 12000 \\text{km s}^{-1}$, the distribution is dominated by Group\nII. The true origin of the two components is unknown, though there could be\nthat naturally there exist two intrinsic velocity distributions as observed.\nHowever, we try to use asymmetric geometric models through statistical\nsimulations to reproduce the observed distribution assuming all SNe Ia share\nthe same intrinsic distribution. In the two cases we consider, 35\\% of SNe Ia\nare considered to be asymmetric in Case 1, and all SNe Ia are asymmetric in\nCase 2. Simulations for both cases can reproduce the observed velocity\ndistribution but require a significantly large portion ($>35\\%$) of SNe Ia to\nbe asymmetric. In addition, the Case 1 result is consistent with recent\npolarization observations that SNe Ia with higher Si II $\\lambda$6355 velocity\ntend to be more polarized.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Oct 2020 02:08:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-21"}

In many graph\nclassification applications, GCN-based approaches have outperformed traditional\nmethods. However, most of the existing GCNs are inefficient to preserve local\ninformation of graphs -- a limitation that is especially problematic for graph\nclassification. In this work, we propose a locality-preserving dense GCN with\ngraph context-aware node representations. Specifically, our proposed model\nincorporates a local node feature reconstruction module to preserve initial\nnode features into node representations, which is realized via a simple but\neffective encoder-decoder mechanism. To capture local structural patterns in\nneighbourhoods representing different ranges of locality, dense connectivity is\nintroduced to connect each convolutional layer and its corresponding readout\nwith all previous convolutional layers. To enhance node representativeness, the\noutput of each convolutional layer is concatenated with the output of the\nprevious layer's readout to form a global context-aware node representation. In\naddition, a self-attention module is introduced to aggregate layer-wise\nrepresentations to form the final representation.

However, there are significant challenges in real-time\nimplementation, as the computational time of the corresponding operations\noptimization model increases exponentially with increasing vehicle numbers.\nFollowing the companion paper (Chen et al., 2020) which proposes a novel\nautomated traffic control scheme for isolated intersections, this study\nproposes a network-level real-time traffic control framework for CAVs on grid\nnetworks. The proposed framework integrates a rhythmic control (RC) method with\nan online routing algorithm to realize collisionfree control of all CAVs on a\nnetwork and achieve superior performance in average vehicle delay, network\ntraffic throughput, and computational scalability. Specifically, we construct a\npreset network rhythm that all CAVs can follow to move on the network and avoid\ncollisions at all intersections. Based on the network rhythm, we then formulate\nonline routing for the CAVs as a mixed integer linear program, which optimizes\nthe entry times of CAVs at all entrances of the network and their time-space\nroutings in real time. We provide a sufficient condition that the linear\nprogramming relaxation of the online routing model yields an optimal integer\nsolution. Extensive numerical tests are conducted to show the performance of\nthe proposed operations management framework under various scenarios. It is\nillustrated that the framework is capable of achieving negligible delays and\nincreased network throughput. Furthermore, the computational time results are\nalso promising.

The relations are in many cases heterogeneous, but entangled together\nand denoted merely as a single edge between a pair of nodes.

In this paper, we introduce a novel graph convolutional network\n(GCN), termed as factorizable graph convolutional network(FactorGCN), that\nexplicitly disentangles such intertwined relations encoded in a graph.\nFactorGCN takes a simple graph as input, and disentangles it into several\nfactorized graphs, each of which represents a latent and disentangled relation\namong nodes. The features of the nodes are then aggregated separately in each\nfactorized latent space to produce disentangled features, which further leads\nto better performances for downstream tasks. We evaluate the proposed FactorGCN\nboth qualitatively and quantitatively on the synthetic and real-world datasets,\nand demonstrate that it yields truly encouraging results in terms of both\ndisentangling and feature aggregation.

It utilizes prior learning experiences to adapt the solution\nstrategy to new domains. On the other hand, deep neural networks (DNNs)\ngenerally need large amounts of data and computational resources for training.\nHowever, this requirement is not met in many settings. To address these\nchallenges, we propose the TUTOR DNN synthesis framework. TUTOR targets tabular\ndatasets. It synthesizes accurate DNN models with limited available data and\nreduced memory/computational requirements. It consists of three sequential\nsteps. The first step involves generation, verification, and labeling of\nsynthetic data. The synthetic data generation module targets both the\ncategorical and continuous features. TUTOR generates the synthetic data from\nthe same probability distribution as the real data. It then verifies the\nintegrity of the generated synthetic data using a semantic integrity classifier\nmodule. It labels the synthetic data based on a set of rules extracted from the\nreal dataset. Next, TUTOR uses two training schemes that combine synthetic and\ntraining data to learn the parameters of the DNN model. These two schemes focus\non two different ways in which synthetic data can be used to derive a prior on\nthe model parameters and, hence, provide a better DNN initialization for\ntraining with real data. In the third step, TUTOR employs a grow-and-prune\nsynthesis paradigm to learn both the weights and the architecture of the DNN to\nreduce model size while ensuring its accuracy. We evaluate the performance of\nTUTOR on nine datasets of various sizes. We show that in comparison to fully\nconnected DNNs, TUTOR, on an average, reduces the need for data by 5.9x,\nimproves accuracy by 3.4%, and reduces the number of parameters (fFLOPs) by\n4.7x (4.3x). Thus, TUTOR enables a less data-hungry, more accurate, and more\ncompact DNN synthesis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Oct 2020 03:25:47 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 01:53:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 16 Feb 2022 01:19:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-17"}

When queuing is imminent, Speed\nHarmonization (SH), which adjusts speeds in upstream traffic to mitigate\ntraffic showckwaves downstream, can be applied. However, because SH depends on\ndriver awareness and compliance, it may not always be effective in mitigating\ncongestion. The use of multiagent reinforcement learning for collaborative\nlearning, is a promising solution to this challenge. By incorporating this\ntechnique in the control algorithms of connected and autonomous vehicle (CAV),\nit may be possible to train the CAVs to make joint decisions that can mitigate\nhighway bottleneck congestion without human driver compliance to altered speed\nlimits.

Consistent with\nexpectations that CAVs will improve road safety, on-road CAVs may adopt rather\nconservative control policies, and this will likely cause HDVs to unduly\nexploit CAV conservativeness by driving in ways that imperil safety. A context\nof this situation is lane-changing by the CAV. Without cooperation from other\nvehicles in the traffic stream, it can be extremely unsafe for the CAV to\nchange lanes under dense, high-speed traffic conditions. The cooperation of\nneighboring vehicles is indispensable. To address this issue, this paper\ndevelops a control framework where connected HDVs and CAV can cooperate to\nfacilitate safe and efficient lane changing by the CAV. Throughout the\nlane-change process, the safety of not only the CAV but also of all neighboring\nvehicles, is ensured through a collision avoidance mechanism in the control\nframework. The overall traffic flow efficiency is analyzed in terms of the\nambient level of CHDV-CAV cooperation. The analysis outcomes are including the\nCAVs lane-change feasibility, the overall duration of the lane change.

One of these technologies is\nconnected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs). With the prospective duality of\noperations of CAVs and human driven vehicles in the same roadway space (also\nreferred to as a mixed stream), CAVs are expected to address a variety of\ntraffic problems particularly those that are either caused or exacerbated by\nthe heterogeneous nature of human driving. In efforts to realize such specific\nbenefits of CAVs in mixed-stream traffic, it is essential to understand and\nsimulate the behavior of human drivers in such environments, and microscopic\ntraffic flow (MTF) models can be used to carry out this task. By helping to\ncomprehend the fundamental dynamics of traffic flow, MTF models serve as a\npowerful approach to assess the impacts of such flow in terms of safety,\nstability, and efficiency. In this paper, we seek to calibrate MTF models based\non empirical trajectory data as basis of not only understanding traffic\ndynamics such as traffic instabilities, but ultimately using CAVs to mitigate\nstop-and-go wave propagation. The paper therefore duly considers the\nheterogeneity and uncertainty associated with human driving behavior in order\nto calibrate the dynamics of each HDV. Also, the paper designs the CAV\ncontrollers based on the microscopic HDV models that are calibrated in real\ntime. The data for the calibration is from the Next Generation SIMulation\n(NGSIM) trajectory datasets. The results are encouraging, as they indicate the\nefficacy of the designed controller to significantly improve not only the\nstability of the mixed traffic stream but also the safety of both CAVs and HDVs\nin the traffic stream.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Oct 2020 03:58:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-13"}

Sign videos consist of continuous\nsequences of sign gestures with no clear boundaries in between. Existing SLT\nmodels usually represent sign visual features in a frame-wise manner so as to\navoid needing to explicitly segmenting the videos into isolated signs. However,\nthese methods neglect the temporal information of signs and lead to substantial\nambiguity in translation. In this paper, we explore the temporal semantic\nstructures of signvideos to learn more discriminative features. To this end, we\nfirst present a novel sign video segment representation which takes into\naccount multiple temporal granularities, thus alleviating the need for accurate\nvideo segmentation. Taking advantage of the proposed segment representation, we\ndevelop a novel hierarchical sign video feature learning method via a temporal\nsemantic pyramid network, called TSPNet. Specifically, TSPNet introduces an\ninter-scale attention to evaluate and enhance local semantic consistency of\nsign segments and an intra-scale attention to resolve semantic ambiguity by\nusing non-local video context.

However, previous research efforts mainly focused on\nterrestrial wireless devices while, to the best of our knowledge, none of the\nprevious work took into consideration satellite transmitters. The satellite\nscenario is generally challenging because, among others, satellite radio\ntransducers feature non-standard electronics (usually aged and specifically\ndesigned for harsh conditions). Moreover, the fingerprinting task is\nspecifically difficult for Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites (like the ones we\nfocus in this paper) since they orbit at about 800Km from the Earth, at a speed\nof around 25,000Km/h, thus making the receiver experiencing a down-link with\nunique attenuation and fading characteristics.

In this paper, we\nstudy the problem of face restoration under a more practical ``dual blind''\nsetting, i.e., without prior assumptions or hand-crafted regularization terms\non the degradation profile or image contents.\n  To this end, a novel implicit subspace prior learning (ISPL) framework is\nproposed as a generic solution to dual-blind face restoration, with two key\nelements: 1) an implicit formulation to circumvent the ill-defined restoration\nmapping and 2) a subspace prior decomposition and fusion mechanism to\ndynamically handle inputs at varying degradation levels with consistent\nhigh-quality restoration results.\n  Experimental results demonstrate significant perception-distortion\nimprovement of ISPL against existing state-of-the-art methods for a variety of\nrestoration subtasks, including a 3.69db PSNR and 45.8% FID gain against\nESRGAN, the 2018 NTIRE SR challenge winner.

A large part of these density structures are thought to be\nbrought about by the interaction of the stellar wind with a close companion.\nThe S-type asymptotic giant branch star Pi1 Gruis, which has a known companion\nat ~440 au and is thought to harbour a second, closer-by (<10 au) companion,\nwas observed with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array as part of\nthe ATOMIUM Large programme. In this work, the brightest CO, SiO, and HCN\nmolecular line transitions are analysed. The continuum map shows two maxima,\nseparated by 0.04'' (6 au). The CO data unambiguously reveal that Pi1 Gru's\ncircumstellar environment harbours an inclined, radially outflowing, equatorial\ndensity enhancement. It contains a spiral structure at an angle of 38+/-3 deg\nwith the line-of-sight. The HCN emission in the inner wind reveals a clockwise\nspiral, with a dynamical crossing time of the spiral arms consistent with a\ncompanion at a distance of 0.04'' from the asymptotic giant branch star, which\nis in agreement with the position of the secondary continuum peak. The inner\nwind dynamics imply a large acceleration region, consistent with a beta-law\npower of ~6. The CO emission suggests that the spiral is approximately\nArchimedean within 5'', beyond which this trend breaks down as the succession\nof the spiral arms becomes less periodic. The SiO emission at scales smaller\nthan 0.5'' exhibits signatures of gas in rotation, which is found to fit the\nexpected behaviour of gas in the wind-companion interaction zone. An\ninvestigation of SiO maser emission reveals what could be a stream of gas\naccelerating from the surface of the AGB star to the companion. Using these\ndynamics, we have tentatively derived an upper limit on the companion mass to\nbe ~1.1 Msol.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Oct 2020 08:04:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-04"}

For the first time,\nwe calibrate q$_{IR}$ as a function of \\textit{both} stellar mass (M$_{\\star}$)\nand redshift, starting from an M$_{\\star}$-selected sample of $>$400,000\nstar-forming galaxies in the COSMOS field, identified via (NUV-r)/(r-J)\ncolours, at redshifts 0.1$<$z$<$4.5.

Estimating the influence of training examples on a learned neural\nmodel's behavior allows us to identify training examples most responsible for a\ngiven prediction and, therefore, to faithfully explain the output of a\nblack-box model. The most generally applicable existing method is based on\ninfluence functions, which scale poorly for larger sample sizes and models.\n  We propose gradient rollback, a general approach for influence estimation,\napplicable to neural models where each parameter update step during gradient\ndescent touches a smaller number of parameters, even if the overall number of\nparameters is large. Neural matrix factorization models trained with gradient\ndescent are part of this model class. These models are popular and have found a\nwide range of applications in industry. Especially knowledge graph embedding\nmethods, which belong to this class, are used extensively. We show that\ngradient rollback is highly efficient at both training and test time. Moreover,\nwe show theoretically that the difference between gradient rollback's influence\napproximation and the true influence on a model's behavior is smaller than\nknown bounds on the stability of stochastic gradient descent. This establishes\nthat gradient rollback is robustly estimating example influence.

The orbital\nperiod, P=99.252 days, was determined from our spectral data and coincides with\nthe period determined in previous studies, as well as the system eccentricity\nof $e=0.517$. Calculated velocity amplitudes of both components allow us to\ndetermine the masses of both system components M_1 = 1.320 M_sun and M_2 =\n1.433 M_sun with the accuracy about of one percent (0.8% and 1.1%),\nrespectively. Luminosities of both components are presented as L_1 = 4.164\nL_sun and L_2 = 6.221 L_sun, and the effective temperatures of both components\nwere directly evaluated (T_eff = 6545~K and T_eff = 6190~K) together with the\nmetallicity of the system [Fe/H] = -0.19 dex and its color excess\nE(B-V)=0.026~mag. Comparison with evolutionary tracks shows that the system age\nis 2.25+/-0.19 Gyr, and both components are on the main sequence and have not\nyet passed the turn point. Spectral type is F5V for the hotter component and\nF8V for another one.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Oct 2020 09:15:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-04"}

This problem setting\nis closely related to the well-known information bottleneck (IB) principle,\nwhich, however, has less been studied for the irregular graph data and graph\nneural networks (GNNs). In this paper, we propose a framework of Graph\nInformation Bottleneck (GIB) for the subgraph recognition problem in deep graph\nlearning. Under this framework, one can recognize the maximally informative yet\ncompressive subgraph, named IB-subgraph. However, the GIB objective is\nnotoriously hard to optimize, mostly due to the intractability of the mutual\ninformation of irregular graph data and the unstable optimization process. In\norder to tackle these challenges, we propose: i) a GIB objective based-on a\nmutual information estimator for the irregular graph data; ii) a bi-level\noptimization scheme to maximize the GIB objective; iii) a connectivity loss to\nstabilize the optimization process. We evaluate the properties of the\nIB-subgraph in three application scenarios: improvement of graph\nclassification, graph interpretation and graph denoising.

The magnetic properties of this compound were\ncharacterized by several experimental techniques, which include magnetic\nsusceptibility, specific heat, dielectric permittivity, electron spin resonance\n(ESR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and neutron powder diffraction (NPD)\nmeasurements, and by density functional calculations (DFT). The magnetic\nsusceptibility chi(T) demonstrates very unusual behavior. It isdescribed by the\nCurie-Weiss law at high temperature with Curie-Weiss temperature of Theta = -74\nK, exhibits no obvious anomaly indicative of a long-range magnetic ordering at\nlow magnetic fields. At high magnetic fields, however, the character of chi(T)\nchanges showing a maximum at about 9 K. That this maximum of chi(T) reflects\nthe onset of an antiferromagnetic order was confirmed by specific heat\nmeasurements, which exhibit a clear lambda-type anomaly at TN around 8.5 K even\nat zero magnetic field, and by 7Li NMR and dielectric permittivity\nmeasurements.

This spin lattice is strongly\nspin frustrated with f = |Theta|/TN around 8 and exhibits a two-dimensional\nmagnetic character in a broad temperature range above TN.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Oct 2020 09:42:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-13"}

Lately, transformer-based models, such as GPT-2, have revolutionized\nthe landscape of dialogue generation by capturing the long-range structures\nthrough language modeling. Though these models have exhibited excellent\nlanguage coherence, they often lack relevance and terms when used for\ndomain-specific response generation. In this paper, we present DSRNet (Domain\nSpecific Response Network), a transformer-based model for dialogue response\ngeneration by reinforcing domain-specific attributes. In particular, we extract\nmeta attributes from context and infuse them with the context utterances for\nbetter attention over domain-specific key terms and relevance. We study the use\nof DSRNet in a multi-turn multi-interlocutor environment for domain-specific\nresponse generation.

Besides, we also observe that the responses\nproduced by our model carry higher relevance due to the presence of\ndomain-specific key attributes that exhibit better overlap with the attributes\nof the context. Our analysis shows that the performance improvement is mostly\ndue to the infusion of key terms along with dialogues which result in better\nattention over domain-relevant terms.

The\nspace segment hosts novel miniaturized detectors to probe the X-ray temporal\nemission of bright events, such as Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), and the\nelectromagnetic counterparts of Gravitational Wave Events (GWEs), playing a\ncrucial role in future multi-messenger astrophysics. During operations, at\nleast three instruments, separated by a minimum distance shall observe a common\narea of the sky to perform a triangulation of the observed event. An effective\ndetection by the nano-satellite payload is achieved by guaranteeing a\nbeneficial orbital and pointing configuration of the constellation. The design\nhas to cope with the limitations imposed by small space systems, such as the\nlack of on-board propulsion and the reduced systems budgets. The paper\ndescribes the methodologies and the proposed strategies to overcome the mission\nlimitations, while achieving a satisfactory constellation visibility of the sky\nthroughout the mission duration. The mission design makes use of a\nhigh-fidelity orbit propagator, combined with an innovative mission analysis\ntool that estimates the scientific performances of the constellation. The\ninfluence of the natural relative motion, which is crucial to achieve an\neffective constellation configuration without on-board orbit control, is\nassessed.

The existence of this crossover velocity and\nadiabaticity of the model is a consequence of the energy gap in the\nquasiparticle spectrum that is opened by the inhomogeneity.

Specifically, we observe the heavy\ntails of gradient noise in these algorithms. This motivates us to analyze these\nalgorithms through their Levy-driven stochastic differential equations (SDEs)\nbecause of the similar convergence behaviors of an algorithm and its SDE. Then\nwe establish the escaping time of these SDEs from a local basin. The result\nshows that (1) the escaping time of both SGD and ADAM~depends on the Radon\nmeasure of the basin positively and the heaviness of gradient noise negatively;\n(2) for the same basin, SGD enjoys smaller escaping time than ADAM, mainly\nbecause (a) the geometry adaptation in ADAM~via adaptively scaling each\ngradient coordinate well diminishes the anisotropic structure in gradient noise\nand results in larger Radon measure of a basin; (b) the exponential gradient\naverage in ADAM~smooths its gradient and leads to lighter gradient noise tails\nthan SGD. So SGD is more locally unstable than ADAM~at sharp minima defined as\nthe minima whose local basins have small Radon measure, and can better escape\nfrom them to flatter ones with larger Radon measure. As flat minima here which\noften refer to the minima at flat or asymmetric basins/valleys often generalize\nbetter than sharp ones , our result explains the better generalization\nperformance of SGD over ADAM. Finally, experimental results confirm our\nheavy-tailed gradient noise assumption and theoretical affirmation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Oct 2020 12:00:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Nov 2021 03:21:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-30"}

I mine the CIA World\nFactbook which provides cross-domain data covering all countries of the world.\nThen, I execute various data preprocessing tasks peaking in simple machine\nlearning which imputes missing values providing with a more complete dataset.\nLastly, the third component presents various projects making use of the\nproduced dataset in order to illustrate the relevance of Data Science to IR\nthrough practical examples. Then, ideas regarding the future development of\nthis project are discussed in order to optimize it and ensure continuity.\nOverall, I hope to contribute to the \"fourth paradigm\" discussion in IR by\nproviding practical examples while providing at the same time the fuel for\nfuture research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Oct 2020 12:28:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-13"}

Those systems called Enterprise Internet of Things (EIoT)\nconnect such environments to the Internet and are professionally managed\nsolutions usually offered by dedicated vendors. As EIoT systems require\nspecialized training, software, and equipment to deploy, this has led to very\nlittle research investigating the security of EIoT systems and their\ncomponents. In effect, EIoT systems in smart settings such as smart buildings\npresent an unprecedented and unexplored threat vector for an attacker. In this\nwork, we explore EIoT system vulnerabilities and insecure development\npractices. Specifically, focus on the usage of drivers as an attack mechanism,\nand introduce PoisonIvy, a number of novel attacks that demonstrate an attacker\ncan easily compromise EIoT system controllers using malicious drivers.\nSpecifically, we show how drivers used to integrate third-party devices to EIoT\nsystems can be misused in a systematic fashion. To demonstrate the capabilities\nof attackers, we implement and evaluate PoisonIvy using a testbed of real EIoT\ndevices. We show that an attacker can perform DoS attacks, gain remote control,\nand maliciously abuse system resources of EIoT systems.

One of the major concerns is that surface\ndefects of perovskite could cause detrimental nonradiative recombination and\nmaterial degradation. In this work, we addressed this challenging problem by\ninserting ultrathin alkali-fluoride (AF) films between the tri-cation\nlead-iodide perovskite layer and both CTLs. This bilateral inorganic walls\nstrategy makes use of both physical-blocking and chemical-anchoring\nfunctionalities of the continuous, uniform and compact AF framework: on the one\nhand, the uniformly distributed alkali-iodine coordination at the perovskite-AF\ninterfaces effectively suppresses the formation of iodine-vacancy defects at\nthe surfaces and grain boundaries of the whole perovskite film, thus reducing\nthe trap-assisted recombination at the perovskite-CTL interfaces and therewith\nthe open-voltage loss; on the other hand, the impermeable AF buffer layers\neffectively prevent the bidirectional ion migration at the perovskite-CTLs\ninterfaces even under harsh working conditions. As a result, a power-conversion\nefficiency (PCE) of 22.02% (certified efficiency 20.4%) with low open-voltage\ndeficit (< 0.4V) was achieved for the low-temperature processed inverted planar\nperovskite solar cells.

These factors may also affect\nchild health and survival in utero or after birth, which implies that\nconventional approaches to explaining sex differences in mortality are likely\nto yield biased estimates.

The compactness is defined by the physical domain of dependence for an\nunstructured triangular cell, which may involve the closest neighbors of\nneighboring cells. The compactness and high-order accuracy of the scheme are\ncoming from the consistency between the high-order initial reconstruction and\nthe high-order gas evolution model under GKS framework. The high-order\nevolution solution at a cell interface provides not only a time-accurate flux\nfunction, but also the time-evolving flow variables. Therefore, the\ncell-averaged flow variables and their gradients can be explicitly updated at\nthe next time level from the moments of the same time-dependent gas\ndistribution function. Based on the cell averages and cell-averaged\nderivatives, both linear and nonlinear high-order reconstruction can be\nobtained for macroscopic flow variables in the evaluation of local equilibrium\nand non-equilibrium states. The current nonlinear reconstruction is a\ncombination of WENO and ENO methodology. The initial piecewise discontinuous\nreconstruction is used for the determination non-equilibrium state and an\nevolved smooth reconstruction for the equilibrium state. The evolution model in\ngas-kinetic scheme is based on a relaxation process from non-equilibrium to\nequilibrium state. The accuracy, efficiency, and robustness of the scheme have\nbeen validated.

Two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations indicate that an isolated\nhalf-cycle pulse with the duration of 8.3 attoseconds can be produced. Apart\nfrom one-cycle driving pulse, such a scheme also can be realized with a\ncommercial 100-TW 25-fs driving laser by shaping the pulse with a relativistic\nplasma lens in advance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Oct 2020 14:01:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Oct 2020 15:49:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-26"}

A\ndynamic flow path network consists of an undirected path with positive edge\nlengths, positive edge capacities, and positive vertex weights. A path can be\nconsidered as a road, an edge length as the distance along the road and a\nvertex weight as the number of people at the site. An edge capacity limits the\nnumber of people that can enter the edge per unit time. In the dynamic flow\nnetwork, given particular points on edges or vertices, called sinks, all the\npeople evacuate from the vertices to the sinks as quickly as possible. The\nproblem is to find the location of sinks on a dynamic flow path network in such\na way that the aggregate evacuation time (i.e., the sum of evacuation times for\nall the people) to sinks is minimized. We consider two models of the problem:\nthe confluent flow model and the non-confluent flow model. In the former model,\nthe way of evacuation is restricted so that all the people at a vertex have to\nevacuate to the same sink, and in the latter model, there is no such\nrestriction.

This\noffsetting procedure does not change the exactness property of the algorithm,\nnamely convergence to the exact FCI solution in the large-walker limit, but at\nits optimal value greatly accelerates convergence. There is no overhead cost\nassociated with this offsetting procedure, and is therefore a pure and\nsubstantial computational gain. We illustrate the behavior of this offset\nadaptive shift method by applying it to the N$_2$ molecule, the ozone molecule\nat three different geometries (equilibrium open minimum, a hypothetical ring\nminimum, and a transition state) in three basis sets (cc-pV$X$Z, $X$=D,T,Q),\nand the chromium dimer in cc-pVDZ basis set, correlating 28 electrons in 76\norbitals. We show that in most cases the offset adaptive shift method converges\nmuch faster than both the normal initiator method and the original adaptive\nshift method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Oct 2020 14:35:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}

Using higher-order derivatives of general nonlinear dynamics that need\nnot be known, we construct a Koopman operator-based linear representation and\nutilize Taylor series accuracy analysis to derive an error bound. The resulting\nerror formula is used to choose the order of derivatives in the basis functions\nand obtain a data-driven Koopman model using a closed-form expression that can\nbe computed in real time. Using the inverted pendulum system, we illustrate the\nrobustness of the error bounds given noisy measurements of unknown dynamics,\nwhere the derivatives are estimated numerically. When combined with control,\nthe Koopman representation of the nonlinear system has marginally better\nperformance than competing nonlinear modeling methods, such as SINDy and NARX.\nIn addition, as a linear model, the Koopman approach lends itself readily to\nefficient control design tools, such as LQR, whereas the other modeling\napproaches require nonlinear control methods.

We also characterize all complementary\nequienergetic pairs of graphs of type $\\mathcal{C}(2)$, $\\mathcal{C}(3)$ and\n$\\mathcal{C}(5)$ in Cameron's hierarchy (the cases $\\mathcal{C}(1)$ and\n$\\mathcal{C}(4)$ are still open). Finally, we consider unitary Cayley graphs\nover rings $G_R=X(R,R^*)$. We show that if $R$ is a finite Artinian ring with\nan even number of local factors, then $G_R$ is complementary equienergetic if\nand only if $R=\\mathbb{F}_q \\times \\mathbb{F}_{q'}$ is the product of 2 finite\nfields.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Oct 2020 15:50:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 28 May 2021 18:55:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-01"}

The almost constant\n$q_c(y)$ value in the second family results from the aggregation of ozone-like\nmolecules, formed from $O^{2-}$ ions of the host with embedded oxygen atoms,\n$O_i$, at interstitial sites in the $CuO_2$ planes.

Strategies to gather, analyze, and negotiate\nrequirements are complemented by efforts to manage customer input after\nproducts have been deployed. For the latter, support tickets are key in\nallowing customers to submit their issues, bug reports, and feature requests.\nWhenever insufficient attention is given to support issues, there is a chance\ncustomers will escalate their issues, and escalation to management is\ntime-consuming and expensive, especially for large organizations managing\nhundreds of customers and thousands of support tickets. This thesis provides a\nstep towards simplifying the job for support analysts and managers,\nparticularly in predicting the risk of escalating support tickets. In a field\nstudy at our large industrial partner, IBM, a design science methodology was\nemployed to characterize the support process and data available to IBM analysts\nin managing escalations. Through iterative cycles of design and evaluation,\nsupport analysts' expert knowledge about their customers was translated into\nfeatures of a support ticket model to be implemented into a Machine Learning\nmodel to predict support ticket escalations.

Cross-correlations naturally arise in many fields of\nimaging, such as optics, holography and seismic interferometry. Compared to the\nsparse signal recovery problem that uses linear measurements, the unknown is\nnow a matrix formed by the cross correlation of the unknown signal. Hence, the\nbottleneck for inversion is the number of unknowns that grows quadratically.\nThe main idea of our proposed approach is to reduce the dimensionality of the\nproblem by recovering only the diagonal of the unknown matrix, whose dimension\ngrows linearly with the size of the problem. The keystone of the methodology is\nthe use of an efficient {\\em Noise Collector} that absorbs the data that come\nfrom the off-diagonal elements of the unknown matrix and that do not carry\nextra information about the support of the signal. This results in a linear\nproblem whose cost is similar to the one that uses linear measurements.

To\nmitigate this issue, we present a method called neighborhood representative\n(NR), which empowers all the existing outlier detectors to efficiently detect\noutliers, including collective outliers, while maintaining their computational\nintegrity. It achieves this by selecting representative objects, scoring these\nobjects, then applies the score of the representative objects to its collective\nobjects. Without altering existing detectors, NR is compatible with existing\ndetectors, while improving performance on real world datasets with +8% (0.72 to\n0.78 AUC) relative to state-of-the-art outlier detectors.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Oct 2020 21:31:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 21 Nov 2021 04:58:51 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 21 Dec 2022 00:30:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-12-22"}

The accuracy of the results returned by such systems, however, can be\nlow due to 1) limited shared vocabulary between code and user query and 2)\ninadequate semantic understanding of user query and its relation to code\nsyntax. Siamese networks are well suited to learning such joint relations\nbetween data, but have not been explored in the context of code search. In this\nwork, we evaluate Siamese networks for this task by exploring multiple\nextraction network architectures. These networks independently process code and\ntext descriptions before passing them to a Siamese network to learn embeddings\nin a common space. We experiment on two different datasets and discover that\nSiamese networks can act as strong regularizers on networks that extract rich\ninformation from code and text, which in turn helps achieve impressive\nperformance on code search beating previous baselines on $2$ programming\nlanguages. We also analyze the embedding space of these networks and provide\ndirections to fully leverage the power of Siamese networks for semantic code\nsearch.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Oct 2020 06:07:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-03"}

In the 4\ndimensional ($4D$) QCD Lagrangian, the Faddeev-Popov ghost that appears to\ncompensate unphysical degrees of freedom in internal fermion propagators can be\nregarded as the partner of a fermion. Donaldson formulated a $5D$ gauge theory.\n  Fubini and Rabinovici formulated superconformal quantum mechanics in de\nSitter space, and Brodsky and de T\\'eramond formulated relativistic light front\nholographic QCD (LFHQCD) in Kaluza-Klein type $5D$ anti de Sitter (AdS) space,\nusing Dirac's light cone gauge, and succeeded in obtaining spectroscopy of\nbaryons (fermions) and corresponding mesons (bosons), except the pion which is\nan axial scalar meson that remains massless.\n  In the LFHQCD, the time parameter $\\tau=t\\pm z/c$, $(z\\in {\\bf C})$ appears\nby the choice of the light-cone gauge, or the front form of Dirac's\nformulation. The theory is an extension of AdS/CFT correspodence of Maldacena\nin which incorporation of Einstein's gravity theory in Maxwell's\nelectromagnetic theory was tried in the framework of the string theory.\n  Taking mathematical frameworks of treating the supersymmetry by Brodsky,\nWitten, Connes and their collaborators as central thema, we summarize other\nsupersymmetric approaches like string theory in particle physics and\nastrophysics. We discuss about 2 dimensional solitons whose dynamics is\nrepresented also by $\\tau=t\\pm z/c$, ($z\\in$ pure quaternion${\\bf H}$).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 12 Oct 2020 07:26:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-09"}
