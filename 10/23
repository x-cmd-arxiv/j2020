Our proposed framework, Once-for-all Adversarial\nTraining (OAT), is built on an innovative model-conditional training framework,\nwith a controlling hyper-parameter as the input.

The accuracy is quantified by a centralized\nprediction reward determined by a centralized decision-maker who perceives the\nobservations gathered by all agents after the task ends.

Due to\npaucity of sufficient word occurrences in such posts, classification of this\ninformation is a challenging task using standard tools of natural language\nprocessing (NLP). Moreover, high complexity and dynamics of the posts in social\nmedia makes text classification a challenging problem. However, considering\nadditional cues in the form of past labels and times associated with the post\ncan be potentially helpful for performing text classification in a better way.\nTo address this problem, we propose models based on the Hawkes process (HP)\nwhich can naturally incorporate the temporal features and past labels along\nwith textual features for improving short text classification. In particular,\nwe propose a discriminative approach to model text in HP where the text\nfeatures parameterize the base intensity and/or the triggering kernel. Another\nmajor contribution is to consider kernel to be a function of both time and\ntext, and further use a neural network to model the kernel. This enables\nmodelling and effectively learning the text along with the historical\ninfluences for tweet classification.

A pitching and heaving foil is\nsimulated via computational fluid dynamics with $121$ unique kinematics by\nvarying the frequency, heaving amplitude, and pitching amplitude. A Reynolds\naveraged Navier-Stokes (RANS) model is employed to simulate the flow over the\noscillating foils at $Re=10^6$, computing the propulsive efficiency, thrust\ncoefficient and the unsteady vorticity wake signature. Using a pairwise Pearson\ncorrelation it is found that the Strouhal number most strongly influences the\nthrust coefficient, whereas the relative angle of attack, defined by both the\nmid-stroke and maximum have the most significant impact on propulsive\nefficiency. Next, the various kinematics are automatically clustered into\ndistinct groups exclusively using the vorticity footprint in the wake. A\nconvolutional autoencoder is developed to reduce vortex wake images to their\nmost significant features, and a k-means++ algorithm performs the clustering.\nThe results are assessed by comparing clusters to a thrust versus propulsive\nefficiency map, which confirms that wakes of similar performance metrics are\nsuccessfully clustered together. This automated clustering has the potential to\nidentify complex vorticity patterns in the wake and modes of propulsion not\neasily discerned from traditional classification methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Oct 2020 16:56:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Jun 2021 17:26:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-27"}

Our results indicate the\npossibility of controlling the molecular few-body magnetization with the\nexternal electric field and pave the way towards studying the magnetization of\nultracold molecules trapped in optical tweezers or optical lattices and their\napplication in quantum simulation of molecular multichannel many-body\nHamiltonians and quantum information storing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Oct 2020 17:35:46 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Nov 2020 19:01:06 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2020 23:07:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-03-21"}

The Trust Game has been widely\nused to quantitatively study trust and trustworthiness, involving a sequential\nexchange between an investor and a trustee. The deterministic evolutionary game\ntheory predicts no trust and no trustworthiness whereas the behavioural\nexperiments with the one-shot anonymous Trust Game show that people\nsubstantially trust and respond trustworthily. To explain these discrepancies,\nprevious works often turn to additional mechanisms, which are borrowed from\nother games such as Prisoner's Dilemma. Although these mechanisms lead to the\nevolution of trust and trustworthiness to an extent, the optimal or the most\ncommon strategy often involves no trustworthiness. In this paper, we study the\nimpact of asymmetric demographic parameters (e.g. different population sizes)\non game dynamics of the Trust Game.

While these approaches have shown some promise in simple\ndomains, they often struggle to explore the relevant regions of the state space\nin more challenging settings, such as vision based robotic manipulation. This\nchallenge stems from an objective that encourages exploring everything in a\npotentially vast state space. To mitigate this challenge, we propose to focus\nexploration on the important parts of the state space using weak human\nsupervision. Concretely, we propose an exploration technique, Batch Exploration\nwith Examples (BEE), that explores relevant regions of the state-space, guided\nby a modest number of human provided images of important states. These human\nprovided images only need to be collected once at the beginning of data\ncollection and can be collected in a matter of minutes, allowing us to scalably\ncollect diverse datasets, which can then be combined with any batch RL\nalgorithm. We find that BEE is able to tackle challenging vision-based\nmanipulation tasks both in simulation and on a real Franka robot, and observe\nthat compared to task-agnostic and weakly-supervised exploration techniques, it\n(1) interacts more than twice as often with relevant objects, and (2) improves\ndownstream task performance when used in conjunction with offline RL.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Oct 2020 17:49:25 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Apr 2021 18:27:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-27"}

A\npopular approach for privacy-preserving text analysis is noise injection, in\nwhich text data is first mapped into a continuous embedding space, perturbed by\nsampling a spherical noise from an appropriate distribution, and then projected\nback to the discrete vocabulary space. While this allows the perturbation to\nadmit the required metric differential privacy, often the utility of downstream\ntasks modeled on this perturbed data is low because the spherical noise does\nnot account for the variability in the density around different words in the\nembedding space. In particular, words in a sparse region are likely unchanged\neven when the noise scale is large. %Using the global sensitivity of the\nmechanism can potentially add too much noise to the words in the dense regions\nof the embedding space, causing a high utility loss, whereas using local\nsensitivity can leak information through the scale of the noise added.\n  In this paper, we propose a text perturbation mechanism based on a carefully\ndesigned regularized variant of the Mahalanobis metric to overcome this\nproblem. For any given noise scale, this metric adds an elliptical noise to\naccount for the covariance structure in the embedding space. This heterogeneity\nin the noise scale along different directions helps ensure that the words in\nthe sparse region have sufficient likelihood of replacement without sacrificing\nthe overall utility. We provide a text-perturbation algorithm based on this\nmetric and formally prove its privacy guarantees. Additionally, we empirically\nshow that our mechanism improves the privacy statistics to achieve the same\nlevel of utility as compared to the state-of-the-art Laplace mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Oct 2020 23:06:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-26"}

Data in this domain exhibits complex multi-relational\nand temporal interactions. Learning from this data is a fundamentally\nchallenging research problem. In this paper, we propose Modal-Temporal\nAttention Graph (MTAG). MTAG is an interpretable graph-based neural model that\nprovides a suitable framework for analyzing multimodal sequential data. We\nfirst introduce a procedure to convert unaligned multimodal sequence data into\na graph with heterogeneous nodes and edges that captures the rich interactions\nacross modalities and through time. Then, a novel graph fusion operation,\ncalled MTAG fusion, along with a dynamic pruning and read-out technique, is\ndesigned to efficiently process this modal-temporal graph and capture various\ninteractions. By learning to focus only on the important interactions within\nthe graph, MTAG achieves state-of-the-art performance on multimodal sentiment\nanalysis and emotion recognition benchmarks, while utilizing significantly\nfewer model parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Oct 2020 18:58:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 28 Apr 2021 18:44:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-30"}

However, little or no attention has been devoted to learning\nalgorithms or objectives which promote domain generalization, with virtually\nall existing approaches relying on standard supervised learning. In this work,\nwe use a meta-learning framework which targets zero-shot domain generalization\nfor semantic parsing. We apply a model-agnostic training algorithm that\nsimulates zero-shot parsing by constructing virtual train and test sets from\ndisjoint domains. The learning objective capitalizes on the intuition that\ngradient steps that improve source-domain performance should also improve\ntarget-domain performance, thus encouraging a parser to generalize to unseen\ntarget domains. Experimental results on the (English) Spider and Chinese Spider\ndatasets show that the meta-learning objective significantly boosts the\nperformance of a baseline parser.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Oct 2020 19:00:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Apr 2021 20:40:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-14"}

To the best of our\nknowledge, these are the only known results that study the analogues of Hamming\nLDCs in channels performing insertions and deletions.\n  Here we continue the study of insdel codes that admit local algorithms.\nSpecifically, we reprove the results of Ostrovsky and Paskin-Cherniavsky for\ninsdel LDCs using a different set of techniques. We also observe that the\ntechniques extend to constructions of LCCs. Specifically, we obtain insdel LDCs\nand LCCs from their Hamming LDCs and LCCs analogues, respectively. The rate and\nerror-correction capability blow up only by a constant factor, while the query\ncomplexity blows up by a poly log factor in the block length.\n  Since insdel locally decodable/correctble codes are scarcely studied in the\nliterature, we believe our results and techniques may lead to further research.\nIn particular, we conjecture that constant-query insdel LDCs/LCCs do not exist.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Oct 2020 19:07:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 19 Nov 2020 02:37:16 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 7 Dec 2020 00:19:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-08"}

The\noverall safety of driving and the comfort of a passenger directly depend on its\nsuccessful solution. The motion prediction problem also remains one of the most\nchallenging problems in autonomous driving engineering, mainly due to high\nvariance of the possible agent's future behavior given a situation. The two\nphenomena responsible for the said variance are the multimodality caused by the\nuncertainty of the agent's intent (e.g., turn right or move forward) and\nuncertainty in the realization of a given intent (e.g., which lane to turn\ninto).

We introduce gauge-invariant\ndimension-6 effective operators that couple the Higgs doublet to leptons,\nthereby giving non-universal tree-level contributions to the couplings of\nelectroweak gauge bosons.

We illustrate our model-independent results with the\nexamples of minimal extensions of the SM involving the vector-like lepton (VLL)\nmodels. We point out that dimension-6 operators coupling the Higgs doublet to\nleptons can affect the rate of $h \\to \\tau \\tau$ decay significantly in\ngeneral, however this effect is restricted to less than a per cent level for\nthe minimal VLL models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Oct 2020 20:00:41 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Jun 2021 16:30:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-22"}

While instruments\npertaining to criminal recidivism and academic admissions, for example, have\ngarnered much attention, the predictive instruments of Child Welfare\njurisdictions have received considerably less attention. This is in part\nbecause comparatively few such instruments exist and because even fewer have\nbeen scrutinized through the lens of algorithmic fairness. In this work, we\nseek to address both of these gaps. To this end, a novel classification\nalgorithm for predicting reunification success within Oregon Child Welfare is\npresented, including all of the relevant details associated with building such\nan instrument. The purpose of this tool is to maximize the number of stable\nreunifications and identify potentially unstable reunifications which may\nrequire additional resources and scrutiny. Additionally, because the\nalgorithmic fairness of the resulting tool, if left unaltered, is\nunquestionably lacking, the utilized procedure for mitigating such unfairness\nis presented, along with the rationale behind each difficult and unavoidable\nchoice. This procedure, though similar to other post-processing group-specific\nthresholding methods, is novel in its use of a penalized optimizer and\ncontextually requisite subsampling. These novel methodological components yield\na rich and informative empirical understanding of the trade-off continuum\nbetween fairness and accuracy. As the developed procedure is generalizable\nacross a variety of group-level definitions of algorithmic fairness, as well as\nacross an arbitrary number of protected attribute levels and risk thresholds,\nthe approach is broadly applicable both within and beyond Child Welfare.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Oct 2020 22:07:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-26"}

Non-resonant conductive\nnanotips are typically employed to realize nanoscale photoelectron sources with\nhigh brightness. However, such emitters require complex non-scalable\nfabrication procedures featuring poor reproducibility. Planar resonant antennas\nfabricated via photolithography have been recently investigated, also because\nof their superior field enhancement properties. Nevertheless, the electron\nemission from these structures is parallel to the substrate plane, which limits\ntheir practical use as electron sources. In this work, we present an innovative\nout-of-plane, resonant nanoantenna design for field-driven photoemission\nenabled by high-resolution 3D printing. Numerical and experimental evidences\ndemonstrate that gold-coated, terahertz resonant nanocones provide large local\nelectric fields at their apex, automatically ensuring out-of-plane coherent\nelectron emission and acceleration.

Based on the polyhedron model,\nconvergence is derived via a series of theoretical analyses and derivations,\nwhich shows that a periodic orbit will evolve into a nearly circular orbit with\na normal periodic ratio (e.g., 2:1, 3:2, and 4:3) and almost zero torsion under\nproper circumstances. As an application of the results developed here, three\nasteroids, (216) Kleopatra, (22) Kalliope and (433) Eros, are studied, and\nseveral representative periodic orbit families are detected, with convergence\nin three different cases: bidirectional, increasing-directional and\ndecreasing-directional continuation. At the same time, four commonalities among\nthese numerical examples are concluded. First, a (pseudo) tangent bifurcation\narises at the cuspidal points during the variations in the periodic ratios in a\nsingle periodic orbit family. In addition, these cuspidal points in the\nperiodic ratio coincide with the turning points during the variations in the\naverage radius, the maximal torsion and the maximal radius of curvature.\nFurthermore, the periodic ratio increases (or decreases) with an increase (or\ndecrease) in the Jacobian constant overall.

Algorithms designed to address multistage\nstochastic linear programming (MSLP) problems often rely upon scenario trees to\nrepresent the underlying stochastic process. When this process exhibits\nstagewise independence, sampling-based techniques, particularly the stochastic\ndual dynamic programming (SDDP) algorithm, have received wide acceptance.\nHowever, these sampling-based methods still operate with a deterministic\nrepresentation of the problem that uses the so-called sample average\napproximation. In this work, we present a sequential sampling approach for MSLP\nproblems that allows the decision process to assimilate newly sampled data\nrecursively. We refer to this method as the stochastic dynamic linear\nprogramming (SDLP) algorithm. Since we use sequential sampling, the algorithm\ndoes not necessitate a priori representation of uncertainty, either through a\nscenario tree or sample average approximation, both of which require a\nknowledge/estimation of the underlying distribution. In this regard, SDLP is a\nsequential sampling approach to address MSLP problems.

While learning a recognition\nmodel that infers object-centric symbolic representations like bounding boxes\nfrom raw images in an unsupervised way, no such model can provide another\nimportant ability of a generative model, i.e., generating (sampling) according\nto the structure of learned world density. In this paper, we propose Generative\nNeurosymbolic Machines, a generative model that combines the benefits of\ndistributed and symbolic representations to support both structured\nrepresentations of symbolic components and density-based generation. These two\ncrucial properties are achieved by a two-layer latent hierarchy with the global\ndistributed latent for flexible density modeling and the structured symbolic\nlatent map.

However, they focus on\none type of TSP problem, namely ones where the points are uniformly distributed\nin Euclidean spaces and have issues in generalising to other embedding spaces,\ne.g., spherical distance spaces, and to TSP instances where the points are\ndistributed in a non-uniform manner. An aim of learning to optimise is to train\nonce and solve across a broad spectrum of (TSP) problems. Although supervised\nlearning approaches have shown to achieve more optimal solutions than\nunsupervised approaches, they do require the generation of training data and\nrunning a solver to obtain solutions to learn from, which can be time-consuming\nand difficult to find reasonable solutions for harder TSP instances. Hence this\npaper introduces a new learning-based approach to solve a variety of different\nand common TSP problems that are trained on easier instances which are faster\nto train and are easier to obtain better solutions.

While metric learning with some adaptation techniques\nseems to be a natural solution to shape similarity learning, the performance is\noften unsatisfactory for fine-grained shape retrieval.

Previous works exploit user-item\nrelationships of one-hop neighbors in the user-item interaction graph to\nimprove the quality of representation. Recently, the research of Graph Neural\nNetwork (GNN) for recommendation considers the implicit collaborative\ninformation of multi-hop neighbors to enrich the representation. However, most\nworks of GNN for recommendation systems do not consider the relational\ninformation which implies the expression differences of different neighbors in\nthe neighborhood explicitly. The influence of each neighboring item to the\nrepresentation of the user's preference can be represented by the correlation\nbetween the item and neighboring items of the user. Symmetrically, for a given\nitem, the correlation between one neighboring user and neighboring users can\nreflect the strength of signal about the item's characteristic. To modeling the\nimplicit correlations of neighbors in graph embedding aggregating, we propose a\nNeighbor-Aware Graph Attention Network for recommendation task, termed\nNGAT4Rec. It employs a novel neighbor-aware graph attention layer that assigns\ndifferent neighbor-aware attention coefficients to different neighbors of a\ngiven node by computing the attention among these neighbors pairwisely. Then\nNGAT4Rec aggregates the embeddings of neighbors according to the corresponding\nneighbor-aware attention coefficients to generate next layer embedding for\nevery node. Furthermore, we combine more neighbor-aware graph attention layer\nto gather the influential signals from multi-hop neighbors.

However, some issues such as\nestimation drift and feature-dependence still remain inherent limitations. On\nthe other hand, infrastructure-based methods can generally overcome these\nissues, but at the expense of some installation cost. This poses an interesting\nproblem of how to effectively combine these methods, so as to achieve\nlocalization with long-term consistency as well as flexibility compared to any\nsingle method. To this end, we propose a comprehensive optimization-based\nestimator for 15-dimensional state of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), fusing\ndata from an extensive set of sensors: inertial measurement units (IMUs),\nUltra-Wideband (UWB) ranging sensors, and multiple onboard Visual-Inertial and\nLidar odometry subsystems. In essence, a sliding window is used to formulate a\nsequence of robot poses, where relative rotational and translational\nconstraints between these poses are observed in the IMU preintegration and OSL\nobservations, while orientation and position are coupled in body-offset UWB\nrange observations. An optimization-based approach is developed to estimate the\ntrajectory of the robot in this sliding window. We evaluate the performance of\nthe proposed scheme in multiple scenarios, including experiments on public\ndatasets, high-fidelity graphical-physical simulator, and field-collected data\nfrom UAV flight tests. The result demonstrates that our integrated localization\nmethod can effectively resolve the drift issue, while incurring minimal\ninstallation requirements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Oct 2020 10:05:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-26"}

Recently, oracle\nservices emerged to provide these applications with real-world data feeds.\nUnfortunately, these capabilities have been used for malicious purposes under\nwhat is called criminal smart contracts. A few works explored this dark side\nand showed a variety of such attacks. However, none of them considered\ncollaborative attacks against targets that reside outside the blockchain\necosystem. In this paper, we bridge this gap and introduce a smart\ncontract-based framework that allows a sponsor to orchestrate a collaborative\nattack among (pseudo)anonymous attackers and reward them for that. While all\nprevious works required a technique to quantify an attacker's individual\ncontribution, which could be infeasible with respect to real-world targets, our\nframework avoids that. This is done by developing a novel scheme for trustless\ncollaboration through betting. That is, attackers bet on an event (i.e., the\nattack takes place) and then work on making that event happen (i.e., perform\nthe attack).

However, a critical issue of IoT\nsensing is that data are usually transient, which necessitates temporal updates\nof caching content items while frequent cache updates could lead to\nconsiderable energy cost and challenge the lifetime of IoT sensors. To address\nthis issue, we adopt the Age of Information (AoI) to quantify data freshness\nand propose an online cache update scheme to obtain an effective tradeoff\nbetween the average AoI and energy cost.

Monthly-binned gamma-ray light curves of 236 bright gamma-ray\nsources, particularly blazars, selected from a sample of 2278 high-galactic\nlatitude objects observed with Fermi-LAT, show flux variability characterized\nby power spectral densities consisting of a single power-law component, ranging\nfrom Brownian to white noise. Aims. The main goal here is to assess the\nOrnstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) model by studying the range of its three parameters\nthat reproduces these statistical properties. Methods. We develop procedures\nfor extracting values of the three OU model parameters (mean flux, correlation\nlength, and random amplitude) from time series data, and apply them to compare\nnumerical integrations of the OU process with the Fermi-LAT data. Results. The\nOU process fully describes the statistical properties of the flux variations of\nthe 236 blazars. The distributions of the extracted OU parameters are narrowly\npeaked about well-defined values (sigma, mu, theta) = (0.2, -8.4, 0.5) with\nvariances (0.004, 0.07, 0.13).

The power\nspectral densities of the synthetic light curves are statistically\nindistinguishable from those of the measured light curves. Conclusions.\nLong-term gamma-ray flux variability of blazars on monthly time scales is well\ndescribed by a stochastic model involving only three parameters.

The SP extraction method is used here for the first time in the remote\nsensing community. Then, the extracted SP is fed into a spectral classifier. In\nthe spatial optimization stage, a pixel-level classifier is used to obtain the\nclass probability followed by an extended random walker-based spatial\noptimization technique. Finally, a decision fusion rule is utilized to fuse the\nclass probabilities obtained by the two different stages. Experiments performed\non three data sets from different scenes illustrate that the proposed method\ncan outperform other state-of-the-art classification techniques. In addition,\nthe proposed feature extraction method, i.e., SP, can effectively improve the\ndiscrimination between different land covers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Oct 2020 12:20:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-08"}

However, recent studies have suggested that the recombination in gas\nclouds smaller than the local Jeans mass ($\\lesssim$ $10^8~M_\\odot$) can affect\nthe reionization history by boosting the number of ultraviolet photons required\nfor ionizing the intergalactic medium. Motivated by this, we performed a series\nof radiation-hydrodynamic simulations to investigate whether the streaming\nmotion can generate variation in the local reionization history by smoothing\nout clumpy small-scale structures and lowering the ionizing photon budget.

Unfortunately, much of the cosmological information is encoded by the\nsmall scales, where the clustering of dark matter and the effects of\nastrophysical feedback processes are not fully understood. This can bias the\nestimates of cosmological parameters, which we study here for a joint analysis\nof mock Euclid cosmic shear and Planck cosmic microwave background data. We use\ndifferent implementations for the modelling of the signal on small scales and\nfind that they result in significantly different predictions. Moreover, the\ndifferent nonlinear corrections lead to biased parameter estimates, especially\nwhen the analysis is extended into the highly nonlinear regime, with both the\nHubble constant, $H_0$, and the clustering amplitude, $\\sigma_8$, affected the\nmost. Improvements in the modelling of nonlinear scales will therefore be\nneeded if we are to resolve the current tension with more and better data. For\na given prescription for the nonlinear power spectrum, using different\ncorrections for baryon physics does not significantly impact the precision of\nEuclid, but neglecting these correction does lead to large biases in the\ncosmological parameters. In order to extract precise and unbiased constraints\non cosmological parameters from Euclid cosmic shear data, it is therefore\nessential to improve the accuracy of the recipes that account for nonlinear\nstructure formation, as well as the modelling of the impact of astrophysical\nprocesses that redistribute the baryons.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Oct 2020 13:13:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-26"}

Despite effectiveness, the working mechanisms of\nthe decoupled GCN are not well understood. In this paper, we explore the\ndecoupled GCN for semi-supervised node classification from a novel and\nfundamental perspective -- label propagation. We conduct thorough theoretical\nanalyses, proving that the decoupled GCN is essentially the same as the\ntwo-step label propagation: first, propagating the known labels along the graph\nto generate pseudo-labels for the unlabeled nodes, and second, training normal\nneural network classifiers on the augmented pseudo-labeled data. More\ninterestingly, we reveal the effectiveness of decoupled GCN: going beyond the\nconventional label propagation, it could automatically assign structure- and\nmodel- aware weights to the pseudo-label data. This explains why the decoupled\nGCN is relatively robust to the structure noise and over-smoothing, but\nsensitive to the label noise and model initialization. Based on this insight,\nwe propose a new label propagation method named Propagation then Training\nAdaptively (PTA), which overcomes the flaws of the decoupled GCN with a dynamic\nand adaptive weighting strategy. Our PTA is simple yet more effective and\nrobust than decoupled GCN. We empirically validate our findings on four\nbenchmark datasets, demonstrating the advantages of our method.

In order to rule out the\npossibility that this wide smectic-A phase is merely an artifact caused by the\none-species approximation, we investigate an extension which accounts\nexplicitly for cations and anions in ILCs. Our present findings, obtained by\ngrand canonical Monte Carlo simulations, show that the phase transitions\nbetween the isotropic and the smectic-A phases of the cation-anion system are\nin qualitative agreement with the effective one-species model used in the\npreceding studies. In particular, for ILCs with mesogenes (i.e., liquid-crystal\nforming species) carrying charged sites at their tips, the wide smectic-A phase\nforms, at low temperatures and within an intermediate density range, in between\nthe isotropic and a hexagonal crystal phase. We find that in the ordinary\nsmectic-A phase the spatial distribution of the counterions of the mesogens is\napproximately uniform, whereas in the wide smectic-A phase the small\ncounterions accumulate in between the smectic layers. Due to this phenomenology\nthe wide smectic-A phase could be interesting for applications which hinge on\nthe presence of conductivity channels for mobile ions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Oct 2020 14:09:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}

Albeit deeper network and larger model\ncapacity generally benefit performance, it remains a challenging practical\nissue to train a very deep image denoising network. Using multilevel\nwavelet-CNN (MWCNN) as an example, we empirically find that the denoising\nperformance cannot be significantly improved by either increasing wavelet\ndecomposition levels or increasing convolution layers within each level. To\ncope with this issue, this paper presents a multi-level wavelet residual\nnetwork (MWRN) architecture as well as a progressive training (PTMWRN) scheme\nto improve image denoising performance. In contrast to MWCNN, our MWRN\nintroduces several residual blocks after each level of discrete wavelet\ntransform (DWT) and before inverse discrete wavelet transform (IDWT). For\neasing the training difficulty, scale-specific loss is applied to each level of\nMWRN by requiring the intermediate output to approximate the corresponding\nwavelet subbands of ground-truth clean image. To ensure the effectiveness of\nscale-specific loss, we also take the wavelet subbands of noisy image as the\ninput to each scale of the encoder. Furthermore, progressive training scheme is\nadopted for better learning of MWRN by beigining with training the lowest level\nof MWRN and progressively training the upper levels to bring more fine details\nto denoising results. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world noisy images\nshow that our PT-MWRN performs favorably against the state-of-the-art denoising\nmethods in terms both quantitative metrics and visual quality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Oct 2020 14:14:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-26"}

Its recently reported X-ray properties suggest that J2056-3014 is an\nunusual accretion-powered intermediate polar that harbors a fast-spinning white\ndwarf (WD) with a spin period of $29.6$ s. The low X-ray luminosity and the\nrelatively modest accretion rate per unit area suggest that the shock is not\noccurring near the WD surface. It has been argued that, under these conditions,\nthe maximum temperature of the shock cannot be directly used to determine the\nmass of the WD (which, under the abovementioned assumptions, would be around\n$0.46$ $M_\\odot$). Here, we explore the stability of this rapidly rotating WD\nusing a modern equation of state (EoS) that accounts for electron--ion,\nelectron--electron, and ion--ion interactions. For this EoS, we determine the\nmass density thresholds for the onset of pycnonuclear fusion reactions and\nstudy the impact of microscopic stability and rapid rotation on the structure\nand stability of WDs, considering them with helium, carbon, oxygen, and neon.\nFrom this analysis, we obtain a minimum mass for CTCV J2056--3014 of\n$0.56~M_\\odot$ and a maximum mass of around $1.38~M_\\odot$. If the mass of CTCV\nJ2056--3014 is close to the lower mass limit, its equatorial radius would be on\nthe order of $10^4$~km due to rapid rotation. Such a radius is significantly\nlarger than that of a nonrotating WD of average mass ($0.6\\, M_\\odot$), which\nis on the order of $7\\times 10^3$~km.

Quantifying\nglobal strains, however, requires a fast and precise method of tracking\nlong-axis motion throughout the cardiac cycle. Valve landmarks such as the\ninsertion of leaflets into the myocardial wall provide features that can be\ntracked to measure global long-axis motion. Feature tracking methods require\ninitialisation, which can be time-consuming in studies with large cohorts.\nTherefore, this study developed and trained a neural network to identify ten\nfeatures from unlabeled long-axis MR images: six mitral valve points from three\nlong-axis views, two aortic valve points and two tricuspid valve points. This\nstudy used manual annotations of valve landmarks in standard 2-, 3- and\n4-chamber long-axis images collected in clinical scans to train the network.\nThe accuracy in the identification of these ten features, in pixel distance,\nwas compared with the accuracy of two commonly used feature tracking methods as\nwell as the inter-observer variability of manual annotations.

Classical methods optimize both the data-to-model correspondences and\nthe human model parameters (pose and shape), but are reliable only when\ninitialized close to the solution. Some methods initialize the optimization\nbased on fully supervised correspondence predictors, which is not\ndifferentiable end-to-end, and can only process a single scan at a time. Our\nmain contribution is LoopReg, an end-to-end learning framework to register a\ncorpus of scans to a common 3D human model. The key idea is to create a\nself-supervised loop. A backward map, parameterized by a Neural Network,\npredicts the correspondence from every scan point to the surface of the human\nmodel. A forward map, parameterized by a human model, transforms the\ncorresponding points back to the scan based on the model parameters (pose and\nshape), thus closing the loop. Formulating this closed loop is not\nstraightforward because it is not trivial to force the output of the NN to be\non the surface of the human model - outside this surface the human model is not\neven defined. To this end, we propose two key innovations. First, we define the\ncanonical surface implicitly as the zero level set of a distance field in R3,\nwhich in contrast to morecommon UV parameterizations, does not require cutting\nthe surface, does not have discontinuities, and does not induce distortion.\nSecond, we diffuse the human model to the 3D domain R3. This allows to map the\nNN predictions forward,even when they slightly deviate from the zero level set.\nResults demonstrate that we can train LoopRegmainly self-supervised - following\na supervised warm-start, the model becomes increasingly more accurate as\nadditional unlabelled raw scans are processed.

In order to apply $S$-matrix\ntechniques, based on unitarity and analyticity, we first derive an $S$-matrix\nfree of infrared divergences. This is achieved by removing a divergent phase\nfactor due to the interactions mediated by the massless particles in the\ncrossed channels, a procedure that is related to previous formalisms to treat\ninfrared divergences. We apply this method in detail by unitarizing the Born\nterms for graviton-graviton scattering in pure gravity and we find a scalar\ngraviton-graviton resonance with vacuum quantum numbers ($J^{PC}=0^{++}$) that\nwe call the \\textit{graviball}. Remarkably, this resonance is located below the\nPlanck mass but deep in the complex $s$-plane (with $s$ the usual Mandelstam\nvariable), so that its effects along the physical real $s$ axis peak for values\nsignificantly lower than this scale. We argue that the position and width of\nthe graviball are reduced when including extra light fields in the theory. This\ncould lead to phenomenological consequences in scenarios of quantum gravity\nwith a large number of such fields or, in general, with a low-energy\nultraviolet completion. We also apply this formalism to two non-relativistic\npotentials with exact known solutions for the scattering amplitudes: Coulomb\nscattering and an energy-dependent potential obtained from the Coulomb one with\na zero at threshold. This latter case shares the same $J=0$ partial-wave\nprojected Born term as the graviton-graviton case, except for a global factor.\nWe find that the relevant resonance structure of these examples is reproduced\nby our methods, which represents a strong indication of their robustness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Oct 2020 14:57:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 16 Dec 2021 16:00:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-17"}

Several geostatistical models have been proposed in the\nliterature, however often the data structure presents an excess of zeros and\nextreme values, which can lead to unreliable estimates when these are ignored\nin the modelling process. To deal with these issues, we propose a\npoint-referenced zero-inflated model to model the probability of presence\ntogether with the positive observations and a point-referenced generalised\nPareto model for the extremes. Finally, we combine the results of these two\nmodels to get the spatial predictions of the variable of interest. We follow a\nBayesian approach and the inference is made using the package R-INLA in the\nsoftware R. Our proposed methodology was illustrated through the analysis of\nthe spatial distribution of sardine eggs density (eggs/$m^3$). The results\nshowed that the combined model for zero-inflated and extreme values improved\nthe spatial prediction accuracy. Accordingly, our conclusion is that it is\nrelevant to consider the data structure in the modelling process. Also, the\nhierarchical model considered can be widely applicable in many ecological\nproblems and even in other contexts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Oct 2020 15:18:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-26"}

Dense molecular filaments are ubiquituous in the interstellar\nmedium, yet their internal physical conditions and formation mechanism remain\ndebated. Aims. We study the kinematics and physical conditions in the Musca\nfilament and the Chamaeleon-Musca complex to constrain the physics of filament\nformation. Methods. We produced CO(2-1) isotopologue maps with the APEX\ntelescope that cut through the Musca filament. We further study a NANTEN2\n$^{12}$CO(1-0) map of the Musca cloud and the HI emission of the\nChamaeleon-Musca complex. Results. The Musca cloud contains multiple velocity\ncomponents. Radiative transfer modelling of the CO emission indicates that the\nMusca filament consists of a cold ($\\sim$10 K), dense (n$_{H_2}\\sim$10$^4$\ncm$^{-3}$) crest, which is best described with a cylindrical geometry.\nConnected to the crest, a separate gas component at T$\\sim$15 K and\nn$_{H_2}\\sim$10$^3$ cm$^{-3}$ is found, the so-called strands. The filament\ncrest has a transverse velocity gradient that is linked to the kinematics of\nthe nearby ambient cloud. Studying the large scale kinematics, we find\ncoherence of the asymmetric kinematics from the 50 pc HI cloud down to the\nMusca filament.

Conclusions. The dense Musca\nfilament crest is a long-lived (several crossing times), dynamic structure that\ncan form stars in the near future because of continuous mass accretion. This\nmass accretion appears to be triggered by a HI cloud-cloud collision, which\nbends the magnetic field around dense filaments. This bending of the magnetic\nfield is then responsible for the observed asymmetric accretion scenario of the\nMusca filament, which is, for instance, seen as a V-shape in the\nposition-velocity (PV) diagram.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Oct 2020 15:24:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-04"}

An internal short circuit\nwith low resistance is called a hard internal short, which causes a high\ninternal current flow that leads to an extremely fast temperature rise, gas\ngeneration, cell swelling, and ultimately battery rupture and failure. Thus it\nis crucial to detect these faults immediately after they get triggered. In\nlarge battery packs with many cells in parallel, detecting an internal short\ncircuit event using voltage is difficult due to suppression of the voltage\nsignal from the faulty cell by the other healthy cells connected in parallel.\nIn contrast, analyzing the gas composition in the pack enclosure can provide a\nrobust single cell failure detection method. At elevated temperature,\ndecomposition of the battery materials results in gas generation and cell\nswelling.

The deployment of such networks in large scale\nrequires the enforcement of stringent security mechanisms that need to abide by\nthe technical, societal, legal, and economical requirements of Intelligent\nTransportation Systems. Authentication is an effective process for validating\nuser identity in vehicular netoworks. However, it cannot guarantee the network\nsecurity by itself. Available industrial standards do not consider methods to\npromptly revoke misbehaving vehicles. The only available protection consists on\nthe \\textit{revocation by expiry}, which tolerates the misbehaving vehicle to\nremain trusted in the system for a long time (e.g. 3 months with certificate\npre-loading according to EU security policy). This poses a huge yet dangerous\nlimitation to the security of the vehicular ecosystem. In this work we propose\na Distributed Ledger-based Certificate Revocation Scheme for Vehicular Ad-hoc\nNetworks (VANETs) that harnesses the advantages of the underlying Distributed\nLedger Technology (DLT) to implement a privacy-aware revocation process that is\nfully transparent to all participating entities and meets the critical message\nprocessing times defined by EU and US standards.

For\nsome tasks, only the result of data fusion is needed. Then, the whole process\ncan be realized in an efficient way, integrating the data collection and fusion\nin one step by over-the-air computation (AirComp). Its shortcoming, however, is\nsignal distortion when channel gains of nodes are different, which cannot be\nwell solved by transmission power control alone in times of deep fading. To\naddress this issue, in this paper, we propose a multi-slot over-the-air\ncomputation (MS-AirComp) framework for the sum estimation in fading channels.\nCompared with conventional data collection (one slot for each node) and AirComp\n(one slot for all nodes), MS-AirComp is an alternative policy that lies between\nthem, exploiting multiple slots to improve channel gains so as to facilitate\npower control. Specifically, the transmissions are distributed over multiple\nslots and a threshold of channel gain is set for distributed transmission\nscheduling. Each node transmits its signal only once, in the slot when its\nchannel gain first gets above the threshold, or in the last slot when its\nchannel gain remains below the threshold. Theoretical analysis gives the\nclosed-form of the computation error in fading channels, based on which the\noptimal parameters are found. Noticing that computation error tends to be\nreduced at the cost of more transmission power, a method is suggested to\ncontrol the increase of transmission power. Simulations confirm that the\nproposed method can effectively reduce computation error, compared with\nstate-of-the-art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Oct 2020 03:45:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 10 May 2021 01:37:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-11"}

Although biological\ninvasion success could be explained by the lack of natural enemies in new\nregions, recent studies have revealed that resident herbivores often do have a\nsubstantial effect on both native and invasive plants. Very few studies have\nincluded consideration of native plant resistance while estimating methods of\ncontrolling invasion; hence, it is unclear to what extent the interactive\neffects of controlling approaches and native plants' resistance could slow down\nor even inhibit biological invasion. We developed a spatial modeling framework,\nusing a paired logistic equation model, with considerations of the dispersal\nprocesses, to capture the dynamics change of native and invasive plants under\nvarious strategies of control. We found that when biocontrol agents could have\na strong effect on invasive plant, that could almost completely limit the\ninvasion, together with a high native plant resistance. However, a high\napplication frequency is needed make an efficient impact, whereas, a low\nfrequency treatment leads to nearly the same outcome as the no treatment case.\nLastly, we showed that evenly controlling a larger area with a weaker effect\nstill lead to a better outcome than focusing on small patches with a stronger\neffect.
