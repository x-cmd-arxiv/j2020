Two-dimensional van der Waals materials\nand more specific, 2D chalcogenides are a promising class of new materials\nawaiting their usage in the semiconductor industry. However, the integration of\nvan der Waals materials relying on industry-compatible manufacturing processes\nis still a major challenge. This is currently restricting the application of\nthese new materials to the research laboratories environment only. The\nlarge-area and single-crystalline growth of van der Waals materials is one of\nthe most important requirements to meet the challenging demands implied by the\nsemiconductor industry. This review contributes to a more generalized\nunderstanding on the integration of van der Waals materials - and in more\nspecific 2D chalcogenides - through the growth process of epitaxy. This, can\npursue further the aspiration of large-area, single-crystalline and defect-free\nepitaxial integration of (quasi) van der Waals homo- and heterostructures into\nthe great world of the semiconductor industry.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Oct 2020 16:04:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-12"}

User energy consumption is inductively derived from the\ntime-to-time standards of living that shape the user's everyday consumption\nhabits. This work builds on the detection of repeated usage consumption\npatterns from consumption logs. It presents the structure and operation of an\nenergy consumption reduction system, which employs a set of sensors,\nsmart-meters and actuators in an office environment and targets specific user\nhabits. Using our previous research findings on the value of energy-related\nmicro-moment recommendations, the implemented system is an integrated solution\nthat avoids unnecessary energy consumption. With the use of a messaging API,\nthe system recommends to the user the proper energy saving action at the right\nmoment and gradually shapes user's habits. The solution has been implemented on\nthe Home Assistant open source platform, which allows the definition of\nautomations for controlling the office equipment. Experimental evaluation with\nseveral scenarios shows that the system manages first to reduce energy\nconsumption, and second, to trigger users' actions that could potentially urge\nthem to more sustainable energy consumption habits.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Oct 2020 17:29:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-12"}

However, the strength of such\nnon-analyticity ordinarily drops exponentially by a Boltzmann-like factor as\nmasses exceed $H$. In this paper, we study an exception provided by a\ndimension-5 derivative coupling of the inflaton to heavy-particle currents,\napplying it specifically to the case of two real scalars. The operator has a\n\"chemical potential\" form, which harnesses the large kinetic energy scale of\nthe inflaton, $\\dot{\\phi}_{0}^{1/2} \\approx 60H$, to act as an efficient source\nof scalar particle production.

This can be\nperformed with Boltzmann solvers, i.e. codes that solve the linear evolution of\ncosmological perturbations. Given the plethora of gravity models, it is crucial\nto have a standardized unified way to describe all of them and take them into\naccount in a Boltzmann code. Dark Energy (DE) and Modified Gravity (MG) models,\nalthough at a first glance quite dissimilar, are possible to unify them within\nthe same framework. In this paper we present a scenario, based on the effective\nfluid approach that allows to map any modified gravity model as an effective\ndark energy fluid and then we show how to implement it into existing Boltzmann\ncodes in a simple and straightforward way. This approach has also the advantage\nthat only a handful of variables are needed to compute, i.e the equation of\nstate $w(a)$ at the background level and the sound speed $c_s^2(a,k)$ and the\nanisotropic stress $\\pi(a,k)$ at the linear perturbation. In particular we show\nthat with simple modifications to the latter Cosmic Linear Anisotropy Solving\nSystem (CLASS) code, which we called EFCLASS, we provide competitive results in\na much simpler and less error-prone approach in including the effects of\nmodified gravity models. To test our modifications, we particularize the\neffective fluid approach to f(R) theories and a surviving class of Horndeski\nmodels, the designer Horndeski (HDES) which have a background exactly to the\nstandard cosmological model $\\Lambda$CDM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Oct 2020 18:49:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-13"}

When multiple objective\nfunctions are present among agents, many works optimize the sum of these\nobjective functions. However, this formulation implies a decision regarding the\nrelative importance of each objective function. In fact, optimizing the sum is\na special case of a multi-objective problem in which all objectives are\nprioritized equally. In this paper, a distributed optimization algorithm that\nexplores Pareto optimal solutions for non-homogeneously weighted sums of\nobjective functions is proposed. This exploration is performed through a new\nrule based on agents' priorities that generates edge weights in agents'\ncommunication graph. These weights determine how agents update their decision\nvariables with information received from other agents in the network. Agents\ninitially disagree on the priorities of the objective functions though they are\ndriven to agree upon them as they optimize. As a result, agents still reach a\ncommon solution. The network-level weight matrix is (non-doubly) stochastic,\nwhich contrasts with many works on the subject in which it is\ndoubly-stochastic. New theoretical analyses are therefore developed to ensure\nconvergence of the proposed algorithm. This paper provides a gradient-based\noptimization algorithm, proof of convergence to solutions, and convergence\nrates of the proposed algorithm. It is shown that agents' initial priorities\ninfluence the convergence rate of the proposed algorithm and that these initial\nchoices affect its long-run behavior. Numerical results performed with\ndifferent numbers of agents illustrate the performance and efficiency of the\nproposed algorithm.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Oct 2020 19:55:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-13"}

Using state-of-the-art numerical simulations, we investigate the\ndynamical effects of magnetic fields on the Moon-forming giant impact. We show\nthat turbulence generated by the collision itself, shear in the boundary layer\nbetween the post-impact debris field and the proto-Earth, and turbulence in the\nvapor component of the disk amplify the field to dynamically significant\nstrengths. Magnetically driven turbulence promotes angular momentum transport\nin the protolunar disk.

The spatial\ncomplexity of such cross-scale simulations renders them unsuitable for simple\nhuman visual inspection. Instead, specialized structure characterization\ntechniques are required to aid interpretation. These have historically been\nchallenging to construct, requiring significant intuition and effort. Here we\npropose an alternative framework for a fundamental structural characterization\ntask: classifying atoms according to the crystal structure to which they\nbelong. Our approach is data-centric and favors the employment of Machine\nLearning over heuristic rules of classification. A group of data-science tools\nand simple local descriptors of atomic structure are employed together with an\nefficient synthetic training set. We also introduce the first standard and\npublicly available benchmark data set for evaluation of algorithms for\ncrystal-structure classification. It is demonstrated that our data-centric\nframework outperforms all of the most popular heuristic methods -- especially\nat high temperatures when lattices are the most distorted -- while introducing\na systematic route for generalization to new crystal structures. Moreover,\nthrough the use of outlier detection algorithms our approach is capable of\ndiscerning between amorphous atomic motifs (i.e., noncrystalline phases) and\nunknown crystal structures, making it uniquely suited for exploratory materials\nsynthesis simulations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Oct 2020 21:29:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 04:15:20 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 17 Oct 2020 02:39:54 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 22 Oct 2021 14:59:39 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Mon, 4 Apr 2022 09:56:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-05"}

This striking\nphenomenon has been observed experimentally and modelled by different\nmean-field reinforcement-learning models in the biology literature.\n  In this paper, we introduce the first probabilistic reinforcement-learning\nmodel for this phenomenon. In this model, the ants explore a finite graph in\nwhich two nodes are distinguished as the nest and the source of food. The ants\nperform successive random walks on this graph, starting from the nest and\nstopped when first reaching the food, and the transition probabilities of each\nrandom walk depend on the realizations of all previous walks through some\ndynamic weighting of the graph. We discuss different variants of this model\nbased on different reinforcement rules and show that slight changes in this\nreinforcement rule can lead to drastically different outcomes.\n  We prove that, in two variants of this model and when the underlying graph\nis, respectively, any series-parallel graph and a 5-edge non-series-parallel\nlosange graph, the ants indeed eventually find the shortest path(s) between\ntheir nest and the food.

However, recent research has\nshown that DNNs can be brittle to even slight variations of the input data.\nTherefore, rigorous testing of DNNs has gained widespread attention.\n  While DNN robustness under norm-bound perturbation got significant attention\nover the past few years, our knowledge is still limited when natural variants\nof the input images come. These natural variants, e.g. a rotated or a rainy\nversion of the original input, are especially concerning as they can occur\nnaturally in the field without any active adversary and may lead to undesirable\nconsequences. Thus, it is important to identify the inputs whose small\nvariations may lead to erroneous DNN behaviors. The very few studies that\nlooked at DNN's robustness under natural variants, however, focus on estimating\nthe overall robustness of DNNs across all the test data rather than localizing\nsuch error-producing points. This work aims to bridge this gap.\n  To this end, we study the local per-input robustness properties of the DNNs\nand leverage those properties to build a white-box (DeepRobust-W) and a\nblack-box (DeepRobust-B) tool to automatically identify the non-robust points.\nOur evaluation of these methods on three DNN models spanning three widely used\nimage classification datasets shows that they are effective in flagging points\nof poor robustness. In particular, DeepRobust-W and DeepRobust-B are able to\nachieve an F1 score of up to 91.4% and 99.1%, respectively.

The benefits of\ngeometric embeddings also introduce a problem of local identifiability,\nhowever, where whole neighborhoods of parameters result in equivalent loss\nwhich impedes learning.

The detection algorithm is based on a single 3D LiDAR and a mono\ncamera sensor used to detect candidate curb features and it effectively removes\nfalse positives arising from surrounding static and moving obstacles. The\ndetection accuracy of the tracking algorithm is boosted by using Kalman\nfilter-based prediction and fusion with lateral distance information from\nlow-cost ultrasonic sensors.

It is believed that our experimental\nresults can guide the future work to choose the suitable positional encoding\nfunction for specific tasks given the application property.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Oct 2020 05:03:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-13"}

However,\nhand-crafting a multi-domain/task model can be both tedious and challenging.\nThis paper proposes a novel approach to automatically learn a multi-path\nnetwork for multi-domain visual classification on mobile devices. The proposed\nmulti-path network is learned from neural architecture search by applying one\nreinforcement learning controller for each domain to select the best path in\nthe super-network created from a MobileNetV3-like search space. An adaptive\nbalanced domain prioritization algorithm is proposed to balance optimizing the\njoint model on multiple domains simultaneously. The determined multi-path model\nselectively shares parameters across domains in shared nodes while keeping\ndomain-specific parameters within non-shared nodes in individual domain paths.\nThis approach effectively reduces the total number of parameters and FLOPS,\nencouraging positive knowledge transfer while mitigating negative interference\nacross domains.

The new viewpoint raises interesting\nquestions, notably on the fluid analogs of the broken symmetry and Higgs\nparticle.\n  Ideal gas dynamics can develop shock-like singularities which are typically\nregularized through viscosity. In 1d, discontinuities can also be dispersively\nsmoothed. In the 2nd part, we develop a minimal conservative regularization of\n3d adiabatic flow of a gas with exponent $\\gamma$, by adding a capillarity\nenergy $\\beta_* (\\nabla \\rho)^2/\\rho$ to the Hamiltonian. This leads to a\nnonlinear force with 3 derivatives of $\\rho$, while preserving the conservation\nlaws of mass and entropy. Our model admits dispersive sound, solitary &\nperiodic traveling waves, but no steady continuous shock-like solutions.\nNevertheless, in 1d, for $\\gamma = 2$, numerical solutions in periodic domains\nshow recurrence & avoidance of gradient catastrophes via solitons with\nphase-shift scattering. This is explained via an equivalence of our model (for\nhomentropic potential flow in any dimension) with a defocussing nonlinear\nSchr\\\"odinger equation (NLS, cubic for $\\gamma = 2$). Thus, our model\ngeneralizes KdV & NLS to adiabatic gas flow in any dimension.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Oct 2020 06:49:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-13"}

Although the standard BN can significantly accelerate\nthe training of DNNs and improve the generalization performance, it has several\nunderlying limitations which may hamper the performance in both training and\ninference. In the training stage, BN relies on estimating the mean and variance\nof data using a single minibatch. Consequently, BN can be unstable when the\nbatch size is very small or the data is poorly sampled. In the inference stage,\nBN often uses the so called moving mean and moving variance instead of batch\nstatistics, i.e., the training and inference rules in BN are not consistent.\nRegarding these issues, we propose a memorized batch normalization (MBN), which\nconsiders multiple recent batches to obtain more accurate and robust\nstatistics. Note that after the SGD update for each batch, the model parameters\nwill change, and the features will change accordingly, leading to the\nDistribution Shift before and after the update for the considered batch.

Even in a distributed framework one central control center acts as a\ncoordinator in majority of the control center architectures. Such a control\ncenter can become a prime target for cyber as well as physical attacks, and,\nhence, a single point failure can lead to complete loss of visibility of the\npower grid. If the control center which runs the critical functions in a\ndistributed computing environment can be randomly chosen between the available\ncontrol centers in a secure framework, the ability of the attacker in causing a\nsingle point failure can be reduced to a great extent. To achieve this, a novel\ndistributed hierarchy based framework to secure critical functions is proposed\nin this paper. The proposed framework ensures that the data aggregation and the\ncritical functions are carried out at a random location, and incorporates\nsecurity features such as attestation and trust management to detect\ncompromised agents. A theoretical result is proved on the evolution and\nconvergence of the trust values in the proposed trust management protocol. It\nis also shown that the system is nominally robust so long as the number of\ncompromised nodes is strictly less than one-half of the nodes minus 1. For\ndemonstration, a Kalman filter-based state estimation using phasor measurements\nis used as the critical function to be secured. The proposed framework's\nimplementation feasibility is tested on a physical hardware cluster of\nParallella boards. The framework is also validated using simulations on the\nIEEE 118 bus system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Oct 2020 09:25:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-13"}

The mainstream methods adopt\nthe self-attention mechanism to model global context information.

In order to solve the\nabove problem, we propose a hierarchical context network to differentially\nmodel homogeneous pixels with strong correlations and heterogeneous pixels with\nweak correlations. Specifically, we first propose a multi-scale guided\npre-segmentation module to divide the entire feature map into different\nclassed-based homogeneous regions.

This suggests\nthese models may not learn the actual syntax of agreement, but rather infer\nshallower heuristics such as `agree with the recent noun'. In this work, we\ninvestigate RNN models with varying inductive biases trained on selectively\nchosen `hard' agreement instances, i.e., sentences with at least one agreement\nattractor. For these the verb number cannot be predicted using a simple linear\nheuristic, and hence they might help provide the model additional cues for\nhierarchical syntax. If RNNs can learn the underlying agreement rules when\ntrained on such hard instances, then they should generalize well to other\nsentences, including simpler ones. However, we observe that several RNN types,\nincluding the ONLSTM which has a soft structural inductive bias, surprisingly\nfail to perform well on sentences without attractors when trained solely on\nsentences with attractors. We analyze how these selectively trained RNNs\ncompare to the baseline (training on a natural distribution of agreement\nattractors) along the dimensions of number agreement accuracy, representational\nsimilarity, and performance across different syntactic constructions. Our\nfindings suggest that RNNs trained on our hard agreement instances still do not\ncapture the underlying syntax of agreement, but rather tend to overfit the\ntraining distribution in a way which leads them to perform poorly on `easy'\nout-of-distribution instances.

Recent related work has started to address the problem but\nstill fails in maximally reducing the consumption of communication resources.\nIn this paper, we propose Event-Triggered Communication Network (ETCNet) to\nenhance the communication efficiency in multi-agent systems by sending messages\nonly when necessary. According to the information theory, the limited bandwidth\nis translated to the penalty threshold of an event-triggered strategy, which\ndetermines whether an agent at each step sends a message or not.

Our motivation comes from the fact that\nan image is worth a thousand words, where richer scene information could be\nleveraged to help distill the commonsense knowledge, which is often hidden in\nlanguages. Our approach, namely Loire, consists of two stages. In the first\nstage, a bi-modal sequence-to-sequence approach is utilized to conduct the\nscene layout generation task, based on a text representation model ViBERT. In\nthis way, the required visual scene knowledge, such as spatial relations, will\nbe encoded in ViBERT by the supervised learning process with some bi-modal data\nlike COCO. Then ViBERT is concatenated with a pre-trained language model to\nperform the downstream commonsense reasoning tasks. Experimental results on two\ncommonsense reasoning problems, i.e. commonsense question answering and pronoun\nresolution, demonstrate that Loire outperforms traditional language-based\nmethods. We also give some case studies to show what knowledge is learned from\nimages and explain how the generated scene layout helps the commonsense\nreasoning process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Oct 2020 13:47:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-13"}

With AKARI's extended 2.5-5 $\\mu m$ wavelength coverage,\nwe self-consistently model for the first time all PAH emission bands using a\nmodified version of PAHFIT. We find $L_\\mathrm{PAH\\,3.3}/L_\\mathrm{IR}$ $\\sim$\n0.1% and the 3.3 $\\mu m$ PAH feature contributes $\\sim$1.5-3% to the total PAH\npower -- somewhat less than earlier dust models have assumed.

The 3.4 $\\mu m$ aliphatic emission and a broad plateau feature\ncentered at 3.47 $\\mu m$ are also modeled. As the shortest wavelength PAH\nfeature, 3.3 $\\mu m$ is susceptible to attenuation, leading to a factor of\n$\\sim$ 3 differences in the inferred star formation rate at high obscuration\nwith different assumed attenuation geometries. Surprisingly, $L_\\mathrm{PAH\\,\n3.3} / L_\\mathrm{\\Sigma\\, PAH}$ shows no sign of decline at high luminosities,\nand the low metallicity dwarf galaxy II Zw 40 exhibits an unusually strong 3.3\n$\\mu m$ band; both results suggest either that the smallest PAHs are better\nable to survive under intense radiation fields than presumed, or that PAH\nemission is shifted to shorter wavelengths in intense and high energy radiation\nenvironments.

Here we present a new approach\nto solve changepoint detection problem using fuzzy rough set theory which is\nable to detect such gradual changepoints. An expression for the rough-fuzzy\nestimate of changepoints is derived along with its mathematical properties\nconcerning fast computation.

Caterini in which the structure of a generic neural network is\nintroduced and the gradient descent algorithm (which incorporates\nbackpropagation) is introduced in terms of their described framework. In the\nend, we use this framework for a specific architecture, which is recurrent\nneural networks on which we concentrated and our implementations are based. The\nbook proves its theorems mostly for classification case. Instead, we proved\ntheorems for regression case, which is the case of our problem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Oct 2020 07:07:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 15:29:29 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 09:14:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-01"}

We present an algorithm to estimate on-stream the number of\nCOVID-19 cases using the data from telephone calls to a COVID-line. By modeling\nthe calls as background (proportional to population) plus signal (proportional\nto infected), we fit the calls in Province of Buenos Aires (Argentina) with\ncoefficient of determination $R^2 > 0.85$. This result allows us to estimate\nthe number of cases given the number of calls from a specific district, days\nbefore the lab results are available. We validate the algorithm with real data.\nWe show how to use the algorithm to track on-stream the epidemic, and present\nthe Early Outbreak Alarm to detect outbreaks in advance to lab results. One key\npoint in the developed algorithm is a detailed track of the uncertainties in\nthe estimations, since the alarm uses the significance of the observables as a\nmain indicator to detect an anomaly.

There are several methods used\nfor product risk assessment, including RAPEX, which is the primary method used\nby regulators in the UK and EU. However, despite its widespread use, we\nidentify several limitations of RAPEX including a limited approach to handling\nuncertainty and the inability to incorporate causal explanations for using and\ninterpreting test data. In contrast, Bayesian Networks (BNs) are a rigorous,\nnormative method for modelling uncertainty and causality which are already used\nfor risk assessment in domains such as medicine and finance, as well as\ncritical systems generally. This article proposes a BN model that provides an\nimproved systematic method for product risk assessment that resolves the\nidentified limitations with RAPEX.

The distance between the maximum and the attractor increases with the\nnoise amplitude $\\sigma$, as we show using WKB approximation and numerical\nsimulations. 2- For such systems, exiting from the basin of attraction is not\nsufficient to characterize the entire escape time, due to trajectories that can\nreturn several times inside the basin of attraction after crossing the\nboundary, before eventually escaping far away.

Only when we bring in observers the fundamentally\ndifferent quantum reality emerges. Similarly the introduction of observers\nchanges the nature of spacetime by causing a split between past and future,\nconcepts that are not well defined in the observer-free world. The induced\ntemporal boundary leads to a resonance condition for the oscillatory vacuum\nsolutions of the metric in Euclidean time. It corresponds to an exponential de\nSitter evolution in real time, which can be represented by a cosmological\nconstant $\\Lambda =2\\pi^2/r_u^2$, where $r_u$ is the radius of the particle\nhorizon at the epoch when the observer exists.

However, matching iris images\nacquired at different spectral bands shows significant performance degradation\nwhen compared to single-band near-infrared (NIR) matching due to the spectral\ngap between iris images obtained in the NIR and visual-light (VIS) spectra.\nAlthough researchers have recently focused on deep-learning-based approaches to\nrecover invariant representative features for more accurate recognition\nperformance, the existing methods cannot achieve the expected accuracy required\nfor commercial applications. Hence, in this paper, we propose a conditional\ncoupled generative adversarial network (CpGAN) architecture for cross-spectral\niris recognition by projecting the VIS and NIR iris images into a\nlow-dimensional embedding domain to explore the hidden relationship between\nthem. The conditional CpGAN framework consists of a pair of GAN-based networks,\none responsible for retrieving images in the visible domain and other\nresponsible for retrieving images in the NIR domain. Both networks try to map\nthe data into a common embedding subspace to ensure maximum pair-wise\nsimilarity between the feature vectors from the two iris modalities of the same\nsubject.
