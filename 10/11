Breaking out of this flow can cause\nthe developer to lose their train of thought and have to start their thought\nprocess from the beginning.

Predictive functionality has been\nharnessed in user applications to speed up load times, such as in Google\nChrome's browser which has a feature called \"Predicting Network Actions\". This\nwill pre-load web-pages that the user is most likely to click through. This\nmitigates the interruption that load times can introduce. In this paper we seek\nto make the first step towards predicting user commands in the IDE. Using the\nMSR 2018 Challenge Data of over 3000 developer session and over 10 million\nrecorded events, we analyze and cleanse the data to be parsed into event\nseries, which can then be used to train a variety of machine learning models,\nincluding a neural network, to predict user induced commands.

We have introduced an integer programming formulation that creates\ndeceased donor initiated chains, considering both paired exchange registry and\ndeceased donor allocations simultaneously. There is a possibility of overlap\nbetween paired exchange registry and deceased donor wait-list registry data as\nrecipients can register for both registries independently. This has also been\naddressed in the paper. A long term simulation study is done to analyze the\ngain of these DD initiated chains over time.

We performed 3D nonideal magneto-hydrodynamic\n(MHD) simulations of a dense core collapse using the adaptive-mesh-refinement\nRAMSES code. For each particle ending in the young rotationally supported disk,\nwe ran chemical simulations with the three-phase gas-grain chemistry code\nNautilus. Two different sets of initial abundances, which are characteristic of\ncold cores, were considered. The final distributions of the abundances of\ncommon species were compared to each other, as well as with the initial\nabundances of the cold core. We find that the spatial distributions of\nmolecules reflect their sensitivity to the temperature distribution. The main\ncarriers of the chemical elements in the disk are usually the same as the ones\nin the cold core, except for the S-bearing species, where HS is replaced by\nH$_2$S$_3$, and the P-bearing species, where atomic P leads to the formation of\nPO, PN, HCP, and CP.

Firstly, we\nfind the curve of EIOP change so that the calculation result by this model\nmatches the data of the first and second waves.

However, most of the existing work either implicitly modeled\nmulti-granularity information via fixed modes or focused on modeling a single\ngranularity, making it hard to well capture this nature for accurate\npredictions. In contrast, we propose a novel end-to-end network, Semi-Decoupled\nMulti-grained Trajectory Learning network (SDMTL), to predict future poses,\nwhich not only flexibly captures rich multi-grained trajectory information but\nalso aggregates multi-granularity information for predictions. Specifically, we\nfirst introduce a Brain-inspired Semi-decoupled Motion-sensitive Encoding\nmodule (BSME), effectively capturing spatiotemporal features in a\nsemi-decoupled manner. Then, we capture the temporal dynamics of motion\ntrajectory at multi-granularity, including fine granularity and coarse\ngranularity. We learn multi-grained trajectory information using BSMEs\nhierarchically and further capture the information of temporal evolutional\ndirections at each granularity by gathering the outputs of BSMEs at each\ngranularity and applying temporal convolutions along the motion trajectory.\nNext, the captured motion dynamics can be further enhanced by aggregating the\ninformation of multi-granularity with a weighted summation scheme.

Understanding patterns of information flow in conversations is a\ncritical step in assessing and improving communication quality. In this paper,\nwe describe COnversational DYnamics Model (CODYM) analysis, a novel approach\nfor studying patterns of information flow in conversations. CODYMs are Markov\nModels that capture sequential dependencies in the lengths of speaker turns.\nThe proposed method is automated and scalable, and preserves the privacy of the\nconversational participants. The primary function of CODYM analysis is to\nquantify and visualize patterns of information flow, concisely summarized over\nsequential turns from one or more conversations. Our approach is general and\ncomplements existing methods, providing a new tool for use in the analysis of\nany type of conversation. As an important first application, we demonstrate the\nmodel on transcribed conversations between palliative care clinicians and\nseriously ill patients. These conversations are dynamic and complex, taking\nplace amidst heavy emotions, and include difficult topics such as end-of-life\npreferences and patient values. We perform a versatile set of CODYM analyses\nthat (a) establish the validity of the model by confirming known patterns of\nconversational turn-taking and word usage, (b) identify normative patterns of\ninformation flow in serious illness conversations, and (c) show how these\npatterns vary across narrative time and differ under expressions of anger, fear\nand sadness. Potential applications of CODYMs range from assessment and\ntraining of effective healthcare communication to comparing conversational\ndynamics across language and culture, with the prospect of identifying\nuniversal similarities and unique \"fingerprints\" of information flow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Oct 2020 04:33:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-15"}

This can seem puzzling; in the worst\ncase, such models do not need to generalize. This puzzle inspired a great\namount of work, arguing when overparametrization reduces test error, in a\nphenomenon called \"double descent\". Recent work aimed to understand in greater\ndepth why overparametrization is helpful for generalization. This leads to\ndiscovering the unimodality of variance as a function of the level of\nparametrization, and to decomposing the variance into that arising from label\nnoise, initialization, and randomness in the training data to understand the\nsources of the error.\n  In this work we develop a deeper understanding of this area. Specifically, we\npropose using the analysis of variance (ANOVA) to decompose the variance in the\ntest error in a symmetric way, for studying the generalization performance of\ncertain two-layer linear and non-linear networks. The advantage of the analysis\nof variance is that it reveals the effects of initialization, label noise, and\ntraining data more clearly than prior approaches. Moreover, we also study the\nmonotonicity and unimodality of the variance components. While prior work\nstudied the unimodality of the overall variance, we study the properties of\neach term in variance decomposition.\n  One key insight is that in typical settings, the interaction between training\nsamples and initialization can dominate the variance; surprisingly being larger\nthan their marginal effect. Also, we characterize \"phase transitions\" where the\nvariance changes from unimodal to monotone. On a technical level, we leverage\nadvanced deterministic equivalent techniques for Haar random matrices, that --\nto our knowledge -- have not yet been used in the area. We also verify our\nresults in numerical simulations and on empirical data examples.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Oct 2020 05:21:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Feb 2021 10:55:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 9 Jun 2021 06:46:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-10"}

If steady-state heat conduction is\nobserved, which is commonly used to assess the heat losses in building, there\nis an analytical solution for one-dimensional problem. For two and\nthree-dimensional problems, especially for the complex geometry cases, one must\nuse numerical methods to solve the heat conduction equation.

The reliability of the results around the singular point\ncould be improved by the refinement of the mesh in the area around the singular\npoint, but as a point of interest is the total heat flux that is entering the\nbuilding element, and it must converge between subdivisions, this method is not\ngood since the reliable result cannot be reached. The problem for the\nconvergence is in the marginal node because the temperature gradient in it\nincreases as the temperature difference remains constant and the distance\nbetween the corresponding nodes decreases. For that reason, Case 1 from the\nbenchmark is inadequate because even if there is a discontinuity in temperature\nfield on the boundary, there is an interval in which this change is to happen,\nand the heat flux has a theoretical limit which is not infinity. From the\nresults of this research, it is shown that one should neglect a certain number\nof singular points in order to achieve the tolerance given by the standard\nsince the temperature further from the marginal node is stable for any\nsubdivision.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Oct 2020 10:11:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Oct 2020 07:17:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-27"}

The\nfractal dimension curves of urban growth in western countries follows the\ncommon logistic function, while these curves of cities in northern China\nfollows quadratic logistic function. Now we want to know whether all Chinese\ncities follow the same rules of urban evolution.

The urban region is divided into four subareas, ArcGIS\ntechnology, box-counting method is adopted to extract spatial datasets, and the\nleast squares regression is employed to estimate fractal parameters. The\nresults show that: (1) The urban form of Shenzhen city has clear fractal\nstructure, but fractal dimension values of different subareas are different;\n(2) The fractal dimension growth curves of all the four study areas can only be\nmodeled by the common logistic function, and the goodness of fit increases over\ntime; (3) The peak of urban growth in Shenzhen had passed before 1986, the\nfractal dimension growth is approaching its maximum capacity. Conclusions can\nbe reached that the urban form of Shenzhen bears characteristics of\nmultifractals, the fractal structure has been becoming better gradually through\nself-organization, but its land resources are reaching the limits of growth.\nThe fractal dimension curves of Shenzhen's urban growth are similar to those of\nEuropean and American cities, but differ from those of the cities in northern\nChina.

Initial conditions are the out-of-equilibrium\ndisks of self-gravitating particles in rigid rotation. By that mechanism,\nrobust and non-stationary spiral arms can be formed within a few free-fall\ntimes by the shearing of the mass ejection following the collapse. With a\ncloser look, we find different properties of the arms in connection with the\ninitial configuration. The winding degree tends to increase with initial\nangular speed provided that a disk is thin. If disk surface is circular, both\nnumber and position of arms are governed by the Poissonian density fluctuations\nthat produce more arms as more particles are introduced. On the contrary, if\nthe surface ellipticity is imposed, the number of arms and their placement are\neffectively controlled. Otherwise, the increase of thickness leads to a\ncomplicated outcome since the number of arms and winding degree are less\neffectively controlled. We speculate that this complexity is caused by a strong\nnon-axisymmetric field during the violent relaxation that disorganizes the\npre-collapse motion and the concentration of particles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Oct 2020 12:22:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-23"}

As one\nbasis for autonomous driving, High Definition Map (HD map) provides\nhigh-precision descriptions of the environment, therefore it enables more\naccurate perception and localization while improving the efficiency of path\nplanning. However, an extremely large amount of map data needs to be\ntransmitted during driving, thus posing great challenge for real-time and\nsafety requirements for autonomous driving. To this end, we first demonstrate\nhow the existing data distribution mechanism can support HD map services.\nFurthermore, considering the constraints of vehicle power, vehicle speed, base\nstation bandwidth, etc., we propose a HD map data distribution mechanism on top\nof Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) data transmission. By this mechanism, the\nmap provision task is allocated to the selected RSU nodes and transmits\nproportionate HD map data cooperatively. Their works on map data loading aims\nto provide in-time HD map data service with optimized in-vehicle energy\nconsumption. Finally, we model the selection of RSU nodes into a partial\nknapsack problem and propose a greedy strategy-based data transmission\nalgorithm. Experimental results confirm that within limited energy consumption,\nthe proposed mechanism can ensure HD map data service by coordinating multiple\nRSUs with the shortest data transmission time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Oct 2020 12:22:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-13"}

Specifically, Gnd+ was depleted from the ELP/water interface and was\nfound to stabilize the collapsed state of the macromolecule when paired with\nwell-hydrated anions such as sulfate. Stabilization in this case occurred via\nan excluded volume (or depletion) effect, whereby sulfate was strongly\npartitioned away from the ELP/water interface.

At higher salt concentrations (>1.5 M), GndSCN switched to\nstabilizing the uncollapsed state because a sufficient amount of Gnd+ and SCN-\npartitioned to the polymer surface to prevent cross-linking from occurring.\nFinally, in a third case, it was found that salts which interacted in an\nintermediate fashion with the polymer (e.g. GndCl) favored the uncollapsed\nconformation at all salt concentrations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Oct 2020 12:37:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-13"}

Typical examples of authentication problems\ninclude face recognition and person re-identification. Data-driven\nauthentication could be affected by undesired biases, i.e., the models are\noften trained in one domain (e.g., for people wearing spring outfits) while\napplied in other domains (e.g., they change the clothes to summer outfits).\nPrevious works have made efforts to eliminate domain-difference. They typically\nassume domain annotations are provided, and all the domains share classes.\nHowever, for authentication, there could be a large number of domains shared by\ndifferent identities/classes, and it is impossible to annotate these domains\nexhaustively. It could make domain-difference challenging to model and\neliminate. In this paper, we propose a domain-agnostic method that eliminates\ndomain-difference without domain labels. We alternately perform latent domain\ndiscovery and domain-difference elimination until our model no longer detects\ndomain-difference. In our approach, the latent domains are discovered by\nlearning the heterogeneous predictive relationships between inputs and outputs.\nThen domain-difference is eliminated in both class-dependent and\nclass-independent spaces to improve robustness of elimination. We further\nextend our method to a meta-learning framework to pursue more thorough\ndomain-difference elimination.

In flows with a high\ndensity ratio at $Re_\\mathrm{\\tau}=$ 600 and $F_\\mathrm{el}/F_\\mathrm{g}=$\n0.004, the particles tend to accumulate at the walls. On the other hand, at a\nlower density ratio, respectively a higher $F_\\mathrm{el}/F_\\mathrm{g}$ of\n0.026, the charged particles still follow the secondary flow structures that\nare developed in the duct. However, even in this case, the electrostatic forces\ncounteract the particles' inward flux from the wall and, as a result, their\nvortical motion in these secondary structures is significantly attenuated. This\nchange in the flow pattern results in an increase of the particle number\ndensity at the bisectors of the walls by a factor of five compared to the\ncorresponding flow with uncharged particles. Finally, at $Re_\\mathrm{\\tau}=$\n300, $\\rho_\\mathrm{p}/\\rho=$ 1000, and $F_\\mathrm{el}/F_\\mathrm{g}=$ 0.026 the\nelectrostatic forces dominate over the aerodynamic forces and gravity and,\nconsequently the particles no longer follow the streamlines of the carrier gas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 11 Oct 2020 15:18:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-30"}

Leveraging deep neural networks, recent works have\nshown great success in processing 3D point clouds. However, those deep neural\nnetworks are vulnerable to various 3D adversarial attacks, which can be\nsummarized as two primary types: point perturbation that affects local point\ndistribution, and surface distortion that causes dramatic changes in geometry.\nIn this paper, we simultaneously address both the aforementioned attacks by\nlearning to restore the clean point clouds from the attacked ones. More\nspecifically, we propose an IF-Defense framework to directly optimize the\ncoordinates of input points with geometry-aware and distribution-aware\nconstraints.

The associated sensitivity to\ninitial conditions is a significant obstacle in forecasting the weather and\nother geophysical fluid flows. Data assimilation is the process whereby the\nuncertainty in initial conditions is reduced by the astute combination of model\npredictions and real-time data. This chapter reviews recent findings from\ninvestigations on the impact of chaos on data assimilation methods: for the\nKalman filter and smoother in linear systems, analytic results are derived; for\ntheir ensemble-based versions and nonlinear dynamics, numerical results provide\ninsights. The focus is on characterising the asymptotic statistics of the\nBayesian posterior in terms of the dynamical instabilities, differentiating\nbetween deterministic and stochastic dynamics. We also present two novel\nresults. Firstly, we study the functioning of the ensemble Kalman filter in the\ncontext of a chaotic, coupled, atmosphere-ocean model with a quasi-degenerate\nspectrum of Lyapunov exponents, showing the importance of having sufficient\nensemble members to track all of the near-null modes. Secondly, for the fully\nnon-Gaussian method of the particle filter, numerical experiments are conducted\nto test whether the curse of dimensionality can be mitigated by discarding\nobservations in the directions of little dynamical growth of uncertainty. The\nresults refute this option, most likely because the particles already embody\nthis information on the chaotic system. The results also suggest that it is the\nrank of the unstable-neutral subspace of the dynamics, and not that of the\nobservation operator, that determines the required number of particles. We\nfinally discuss how knowledge of the random attractor can play a role in the\ndevelopment of future data assimilation schemes for chaotic multiscale systems\nwith large scale separation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Oct 2020 16:53:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Nov 2020 12:16:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-03"}

This was alarming finding for quantum-like modeling of decision\nmaking. Recently, it was shown that this difficulty can be resolved by using of\nthe general QMT based on quantum instruments. In the present paper we analyse\nthe problem of the combination of QOE, RRE, and the well-known QQ-equality\n(QQE). This equality was derived by Busemeyer and Wang and it was shown (in a\njoint paper with Solloway and Shiffrin) that statistical data from many social\nopinion polls satisfy it. Here we construct quantum instruments satisfying QOE,\nRRE and QQE. The general features of our approach are formalized with\npostulates that generalize (the Wang-Busemeyer) postulates for quantum-like\nmodeling of decision making. Moreover, we show that our model closely\nreproduces the statistics of the well-known Clinton-Gore Poll data with a prior\nbelief state independent of the question order.
