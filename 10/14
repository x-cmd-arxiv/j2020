This phase is likely to happen\nvery early during the protostellar disc formation, which is characterised by\nactive gas dynamics. We present numerical simulations of\nprotostellar/protoplanetary disc long-term evolution, which includes gas\ndynamics with self-gravity in the thin-disc limit, and bidisperse dust grain\nevolution due to coagulation, fragmentation, and drift through the gas. We show\nthat the decrease of the grain size to the disc periphery leads to sharp outer\nedges in dust millimetre emission, which are explained by a drop in dust\nopacity coefficient rather than by dust surface density variations. These\nvisible outer edges are at the location where average grain size $\\approx\n\\lambda/2\\pi$, where $\\lambda$ is the observational wavelength, so discs\ntypically look more compact at longer wavelengths if dust size decreases\noutwards. This allows a simple recipe for reconstructing grain sizes in disc\nouter regions. Discs may look larger at longer wavelengths if grain size does\nnot reach $\\lambda/2\\pi$ for some wavelength.

Designs with adaptive\nsample size need to account for their optional stopping to guarantee strict\ntype-I error-rate control. A variety of different methods to maintain type-I\nerror-rate control after unplanned changes of the initial sample size have been\nproposed in the literature. This makes interim analyses for the purpose of\nsample size recalculation feasible in a regulatory context. Since the sample\nsize is usually determined via an argument based on the power of the trial, an\ninterim analysis raises the question of how the final sample size should be\ndetermined conditional on the accrued information. Conditional power is a\nconcept often put forward in this context. Since it depends on the unknown\neffect size, we take a strict estimation perspective and compare assumed\nconditional power, observed conditional power, and predictive power with\nrespect to their properties as estimators of the unknown conditional power. We\nthen demonstrate that pre-planning an interim analysis using methodology for\nunplanned interim analyses is ineffective and naturally leads to the concept of\noptimal two-stage designs. We conclude that unplanned design adaptations should\nonly be conducted as reaction to trial-external new evidence, operational needs\nto violate the originally chosen design, or post hoc changes in the objective\ncriterion. Finally, we show that commonly discussed sample size recalculation\nrules can lead to paradoxical outcomes and propose two alternative ways of\nreacting to newly emerging trial-external evidence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 17:32:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-14"}

The majority of current methods, such as normalized\nmutual information, compare two node partitions derived from a community\ndetection algorithm yet ignore the respective underlying network topologies.\nAddressing this gap, our method deploys a community detection quality function\nto assess the fit of each node partition with respect to the other network's\nconnectivity structure. Specifically, for two networks A and B, we project the\nnode partition of B onto the connectivity structure of A. By evaluating the fit\nof B's partition relative to A's own partition on network A (using a standard\nquality function), we quantify how well network A describes the modular\nstructure of B. Repeating this in the other direction, we obtain a\ntwo-dimensional distance measure, the bi-directional (BiDir) distance. The\nadvantages of our methodology are three-fold. First, it is adaptable to a wide\nclass of community detection algorithms that seek to optimize an objective\nfunction. Second, it takes into account the network structure, specifically the\nstrength of the connections within and between communities, and can thus\ncapture differences between networks with similar partitions but where one of\nthem might have a more defined or robust community structure. Third, it can\nalso identify cases in which dissimilar optimal partitions hide the fact that\nthe underlying community structure of both networks is relatively similar.

The compiled sample\n(N_RRab = 64,850) stems from fundamental mode RR Lyrae variables identified by\nthe VVV, OGLE, and Gaia surveys. The distribution is well fitted by three power\nlaws over three radial intervals. In the innermost region (R < 2.2 deg) the\ndistribution follows Sigma_RRab[1] propto R ^(-0.94 +- 0.051), while in the\nexternal region the distribution adheres to Sigma_RRab[2] propto R^(-1.50 +-\n0.019) for 2.2 deg< R <8.0 deg and Sigma_RRab[3] propto R ^(-2.43 +- 0.043) for\n8.0 deg < R <30.0 deg. Conversely, the cumulative distribution of red clump\n(RC) giants exhibits a more concentrated distribution in the mean, but in the\ncentral R < 2.2 deg the RRab population is more peaked, whereas globular\nclusters (GCs) follow a density power law (Sigma_GCs propto R ^(-1.59 +- 0.060)\nfor R<30.0 deg) similar to that of RRab stars, especially when considering a\nmore metal-poor subsample ([Fe/H]<-1.1 dex).

Fundamentally, a data-driven\ndecision is simply a function that maps the available training data to a\nfeasible action. It can always be expressed as the minimizer of a surrogate\noptimization model constructed from the data. The quality of a data-driven\ndecision is measured by its out-of-sample risk. An additional quality measure\nis its out-of-sample disappointment, which we define as the probability that\nthe out-of-sample risk exceeds the optimal value of the surrogate optimization\nmodel. An ideal data-driven decision should minimize the out-of-sample risk\nsimultaneously with respect to every conceivable probability measure as the\ntrue measure is unkown. Unfortunately, such ideal data-driven decisions are\ngenerally unavailable. This prompts us to seek data-driven decisions that\nminimize the out-of-sample risk subject to an upper bound on the out-of-sample\ndisappointment. We prove that such Pareto-dominant data-driven decisions exist\nunder conditions that allow for interesting applications: the unknown\ndata-generating probability measure must belong to a parametric ambiguity set,\nand the corresponding parameters must admit a sufficient statistic that\nsatisfies a large deviation principle. We can further prove that the surrogate\noptimization model must be a distributionally robust optimization problem\nconstructed from the sufficient statistic and the rate function of its large\ndeviation principle. Hence the optimal method for mapping data to decisions is\nto solve a distributionally robust optimization model. Maybe surprisingly, this\nresult holds even when the training data is non-i.i.d. Our analysis reveals how\nthe structural properties of the data-generating stochastic process impact the\nshape of the ambiguity set underlying the optimal distributionally robust\nmodel.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 18:03:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 21 Feb 2021 21:19:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-23"}

We first\nsystematically investigate the comparisons with naive least-square-regression\nbased model inference and uncover that 1) the same observation data has\nidentical influence on the feasibility of the proposed and the naive model\ninferences, 2) the naive model inference uses all of the redundant data, while\nthe proposed model inference optimally uses the basis and the redundant data.\nWe then study the sample complexity of the proposed model inference in the\npresence of observation noise, which leads to the dependence of the processed\nbias in the observed system trajectory on time and coordinates.

Understanding\ngalaxy evolution thus requires understanding the evolution of both the stars,\nand the neutral atomic and molecular gas, the primary fuel for star-formation,\nin galaxies. For the stars, the cosmic star-formation rate density is known to\npeak in the redshift range $z \\approx 1-3$, and to decline by an order of\nmagnitude over the next $\\approx 10$ billion years; the causes of this decline\nare not known.

This suggests that gas accretion onto\ngalaxies at $z < 1$ may have been insufficient to sustain high star-formation\nrates in star-forming galaxies.

This reduces the total mass inside the aeroshell by more than 100 kg\nand simplifies the aeroshell architecture. MAD's lighter and simpler design is\nlikely to bring the risk and cost associated with the mission down. Moreover,\nthe lighter entry mass enables landing in the Martian highlands, at elevations\ninaccessible to current EDL technologies. This paper proposes a novel MAD\nconcept for a Mars helicopter. We suggest a minimum science payload package to\nperform relevant science in the highlands. A variant of the Ingenuity\nhelicopter is proposed to provide increased deceleration during MAD, and enough\nlift to fly the science payload in the highlands. We show in simulation that\nthe lighter aeroshell results in a lower terminal velocity (30 m/s) at the end\nof the parachute phase of the EDL, and at higher altitudes than other\napproaches. After discussing the aerodynamics, controls, guidance, and\nmechanical challenges associated with deploying at such speed, we propose a\nbackshell architecture that addresses them to release the helicopter in the\nsafest conditions. Finally, we implemented the helicopter model and aerodynamic\ndescent perturbations in the JPL Dynamics and Real-Time Simulation\n(DARTS)framework.

However, for encounters with $b$ of order $r_{\\mathrm{S}}$ or\nsmaller, the DTA typically overpredicts the impulse, $\\Delta \\mathbf{v}$, and\nhence the internal energy change of the subject, $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{int}}$.\nThis is unfortunate, as these close encounters are the most interesting,\npotentially leading to tidal capture, mass stripping, or tidal disruption.\nAnother drawback of the DTA is that $\\Delta E_{\\mathrm{int}}$ is proportional\nto the moment of inertia, which diverges unless the subject is truncated or has\na density profile that falls off faster than $r^{-5}$.

The model of a three-particle bispinor field is used\nfor this purpose. Such a field, in comparison with the usual one-particle\nfield, is considered not on Minkowski space, but on a subset of the tensor\nproduct of three Minkowski spaces, which is characterized by the equality of\ntime coordinates of three events (subset of simultaneity). Such a subset cannot\nbe distinguished by the Lorentz invariant method. But due to the multiparticle\nfield transformation law in the transition from one inertial system to another\none, the dynamic equations for a three-particle field are consistent with the\nprinciple of relativity. The interaction between quarks is introduced by\nrequiring a local SUc(3) invariance. But in the paper a more general way to\nachieve this invariance than the replacement in Lagrangian of ordinary\nderivatives by covariance is proposed. The applied procedure leads to a\ntwo-index tensor of gauge field, both for Lorentz and internal indices. The\nconnection of this field with the bound states of gluons - glueballs is\ndiscussed. It is shown that this glueball field can be represented as the sum\nof two terms: the classical field, which plays the role of the potential energy\nof quark interaction in the proton, and the field corresponding to quantum\nfluctuations around the classical field and describes the quark interaction in\nproton with other hadrons.

Hence,\nthere is strong interest to apply LiDARs in autonomous driving. Different\nexisting approaches process the rich 3D point clouds for object detection,\ntracking and recognition.

This paper proposes a field-tested fast 3D point cloud segmentation\nmethod for these two steps. Our specially designed algorithms allow instantly\nprocess raw LiDAR data packets, which significantly reduce the processing\ndelay. In our tests on Velodyne UltraPuck, a 32 layers spinning LiDAR, the\nprocessing delay of clustering all the $360^\\circ$ LiDAR measures is less than\n1ms. Meanwhile, a coarse-to-fine scheme is applied to ensure the clustering\nquality.

Classical hypotheses for atherosclerosis are\nlong-standing mainly to explain atherogenesis. Unfortunately, these hypotheses\nmay not explain the variation in the susceptibility to atherosclerosis. These\nissues are controversial over the past 150 years. Atherosclerosis from human\ncoronary arteries was examined and triangle of media was found to be a true\nportraiture of cells injury in the media, and triangle of intima was a true\nportraiture of myofibroblast proliferation, extracellular matrix (ECM)\nsecretion, collagen fiber formation and intimal thickening to repair media\ndysfunction. Myofibroblasts, ECM and lumen (intima)/vasa vasorum (VV)\n(adventitia) constitute granulation tissue repair. With granulation tissue\nhyperplasia, lots of collagen fibers (normal or denatured), foam cells and new\ncapillaries formed. Thus, the following theory was postulated: Risk factors\ninduce smooth muscle cells (SMCs) injury/loss, and fibrosis or structure\ndestruction could be developed in the media, which lead to media dysfunction.\nMedia dysfunction prompts disturbed mechanical properties of blood vessels,\nresulting in bigger pressure buildup in the intima and adventitia. Granulation\ntissues in the intima/adventitia develop to repair the injured media.\nAtherosclerosis, stiffening or aneurysm develops depending on media dysfunction\nseverity and granulated tissue repair mode/degree. Nearly all characteristics\nof clinical atherosclerosis could be ideally interpreted with the theory. We\nbelieve that media dysfunction is a key initiator in the pathogenesis of\natherosclerosis. It is expected that media dysfunction theory of\natherosclerosis, should offer better understanding of the etiology for\natherosclerosis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 20:53:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Oct 2020 14:29:05 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 18 Oct 2020 03:47:07 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 2020 04:40:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-22"}

In this paper, we propose a\nweakly-supervised approach for aspect-based sentiment analysis, which uses only\na few keywords describing each aspect/sentiment without using any labeled\nexamples. Existing methods are either designed only for one of the sub-tasks,\nneglecting the benefit of coupling both, or are based on topic models that may\ncontain overlapping concepts. We propose to first learn <sentiment, aspect>\njoint topic embeddings in the word embedding space by imposing regularizations\nto encourage topic distinctiveness, and then use neural models to generalize\nthe word-level discriminative information by pre-training the classifiers with\nembedding-based predictions and self-training them on unlabeled data. Our\ncomprehensive performance analysis shows that our method generates quality\njoint topics and outperforms the baselines significantly (7.4% and 5.1%\nF1-score gain on average for aspect and sentiment classification respectively)\non benchmark datasets.

Finally, we determine\nthe regions where EUV, FUV and X-Rays are dominant in the disk. We perform\nglobal HD simulations using the PLUTO code.

We are also\nable to identify the growth of the `body' modes, with higher growth rate for\nhigher resolution. Full energy saturation and a turbulent steady state is\nreached after 70 local orbits.

Our results show that negative emissions could play a large role,\noffsetting on the order of 3 GtCO2 per year from difficult-to-mitigate sectors\nsuch as freight transportation and heavy industry. This includes up to a 1.6\nGtCO2 per year contribution from DAC, constituting up to 60% of total projected\nnegative emissions in China. But DAC, like bioenergy with carbon capture and\nstorage and afforestation, has not yet been demonstrated at anywhere\napproaching the scales required to meaningfully contribute to climate\nmitigation. Deploying NETs at these scales will have widespread impacts on\nfinancial systems and natural resources such as water, land, and energy in\nChina.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 22:36:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Apr 2021 18:24:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-21"}

This material is an antiferromagnetic honeycomb magnet based on the\ntetravalent lanthanide Pr4+ and has been proposed to host dominant\nantiferromagnetic Kitaev interactions. These measurements reveal magnetic\nfluctuations in Na2PrO3 below an energy of 2 meV as well as crystal-field\nexcitations around 230 meV. The latter energy is comparable to the scale of the\nspin-orbit interaction and explains both the very small effective moment of\naround 1.0 {\\mu}B per Pr4+ and the difficulty to uncover any static magnetic\nscattering below the ordering transition at TN = 4.6 K. By comparing the\nlow-energy magnetic excitations in Na2PrO3 to that of the isostructural\nspin-only compound, Na2TbO3, a microscopic model of exchange interactions is\ndeveloped that implicates dominant and surprisingly large Heisenberg exchange\ninteractions J approximately equal to 1.1(1) meV. Although antiferromagnetic\nKitaev interactions with K less than or equal to 0.2J cannot be excluded, the\ninelastic neutron scattering data of Na2PrO3 is best explained with a delta =\n1.24(2) easy-axis XXZ exchange anisotropy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Oct 2020 23:57:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-17"}

As a result\npractitioners must rely on either sampling algorithms such as Markov chain\nMonte Carlo or variational methods to obtain an approximate posterior. Mean\nfield variational inference is a particularly simple and popular framework that\nis often amenable to analytically deriving closed-form parameter updates. When\nall distributions in the model are members of exponential families and are\nconditionally conjugate, optimization schemes can often be derived by hand.\nYet, I show that using standard mean field variational inference can fail to\nproduce sensible results for models with sparsity-inducing priors, such as the\nspike-and-slab.

First, a modified version of Nested Dissection is\nused to identify interiors/separators and reorder the matrix.

Due to this reason, it\nis reported that two spaceborne SARs at orbit cross positions can potentially\ncause severe mutual interference. Specifically, the transmitting signal of a\nSAR, typically linear frequency modulated (LFM), can be directly received by\nthe side or back lobes of another SAR's antenna, causing radiometric artefacts\nin the focused image. This paper tries to model and characterize the artefacts,\nand study efficient methods for mitigating them. To this end, we formulate an\nanalytical model for describing the artefact, which reveals that the mutual\ninterference can introduce a two-dimensional LFM radiometric artefact in image\ndomain with a limited spatial extent. We show that the artefact is low-rank\nbased on range-azimuth decoupling analysis and two-dimensional high-order\nTaylor expansion.

However, most of\nthem only use the normal data in the training phase and can not ensure the\nreconstruction process of anomaly data.

The performance of the\nclosed loop usually depends on the correct setting of these parameters. Tuning\nis often done manually by experts based on a simulation model of the system.\nTwo problems arise with this procedure. Firstly, experts need to be skilled and\nstill may not be able to find the optimal parametrization. Secondly, the\nperformance of the simulation model might not be able to be carried over to the\nreal world application due to model inaccuracies within the simulation. With\nthis contribution, we demonstrate on an industrial milling process how Bayesian\noptimization can automate the tuning process and help to solve the mentioned\nproblems. Robust parametrization is ensured by perturbing the simulation with\narbitrarily distributed model plant mismatches. The objective is to minimize\nthe expected integral reference tracking error, guaranteeing acceptable worst\ncase behavior while maintaining real-time capability. These verbal requirements\nare translated into a constrained stochastic mixed-integer black-box\noptimization problem. A two stage min-max-type Bayesian optimization procedure\nis developed and compared to benchmark algorithms in a simulation study of a\nCNC machining center.

Its steady state exhibits a transition from a gravity\ndominated regime at low velocity towards a high velocity regime where the\nstring takes the form of a self-supporting loop. Here we show that this loop of\nlight string is not suspended in the air due to inertia, but through the\nhydrodynamic drag exerted by the surrounding fluid, namely air. We investigate\nthis drag experimentally and theoretically for a smooth long cylinder moving\nalong its axis. We then derive the equations describing the shape of the string\nloop in the limit of vanishing string radius. The solutions present a critical\npoint, analogous to a hydraulic jump, separating a supercritical zone where the\nwave velocity is smaller than the rope velocity, from a subcritical zone where\nwaves propagate faster than the rope velocity. This property could be leveraged\nto create a white hole analogue similar to what has been demonstrated using\nsurface waves on a flowing fluid. Loop solutions that are regular at the\ncritical point are derived, discussed and compared to the experiment.

A general strategy uses an appropriate utility function to sample\nthe space to recommend the next optimal experiment or calculation within an\nactive learning loop. However, knowing what the optimal sampling strategy to\nuse to minimize the number of experiments is an outstanding problem. We compare\na number of strategies based on directed exploration on several materials\nproblems of varying complexity using a Kriging based model.

Many\ngovernments have taken measures to curb the spread of such misinformation for\npublic well being. Besides global measures, to have effective outreach, systems\nfor demographically local languages have an important role to play in this\neffort. Towards this, we propose an approach to detect fake news about COVID-19\nearly on from social media, such as tweets, for multiple Indic-Languages\nbesides English. In addition, we also create an annotated dataset of Hindi and\nBengali tweet for fake news detection. We propose a BERT based model augmented\nwith additional relevant features extracted from Twitter to identify fake\ntweets. To expand our approach to multiple Indic languages, we resort to mBERT\nbased model which is fine-tuned over created dataset in Hindi and Bengali. We\nalso propose a zero-shot learning approach to alleviate the data scarcity issue\nfor such low resource languages. Through rigorous experiments, we show that our\napproach reaches around 89% F-Score in fake tweet detection which supercedes\nthe state-of-the-art (SOTA) results.

However, Transformer and its existing\nvariants may not be optimal in capturing token distances because the position\nor distance embeddings used by these methods usually cannot keep the precise\ninformation of real distances, which may not be beneficial for modeling the\norders and relations of contexts. In this paper, we propose DA-Transformer,\nwhich is a distance-aware Transformer that can exploit the real distance. We\npropose to incorporate the real distances between tokens to re-scale the raw\nself-attention weights, which are computed by the relevance between attention\nquery and key. Concretely, in different self-attention heads the relative\ndistance between each pair of tokens is weighted by different learnable\nparameters, which control the different preferences on long- or short-term\ninformation of these heads. Since the raw weighted real distances may not be\noptimal for adjusting self-attention weights, we propose a learnable sigmoid\nfunction to map them into re-scaled coefficients that have proper ranges. We\nfirst clip the raw self-attention weights via the ReLU function to keep\nnon-negativity and introduce sparsity, and then multiply them with the\nre-scaled coefficients to encode real distance information into self-attention.\nExtensive experiments on five benchmark datasets show that DA-Transformer can\neffectively improve the performance of many tasks and outperform the vanilla\nTransformer and its several variants.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Oct 2020 10:09:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 11 Apr 2021 09:01:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-13"}

We further characterize this system by improving the physical and\norbital properties and search for additional planetary-mass components in the\nsystem, also exploring the possibility of co-orbitals.

Aims. The aim of the paper is to derive\nexplicit forms for stationary configurations of magnetized plasmas with planar\nshearing flows,within the Hybrid Vlasov-Maxwell description. Two configurations\nare considered: the first with a uniform magnetic field obliquely directed with\nrespect to the bulk velocity; and the second with a uniform-magnitude\nvariable-direction magnetic field.

While many previous\nstudies focused on the activity of these materials, a better understanding of\nthe material transformations relating to activation or degradation is highly\ndesirable, both from a scientific perspective and for applications. We\nelectrodeposited Na-containing MnOx without long-range order from an alkaline\nsolution to investigate these aspects by cyclic voltammetry, scanning electron\nmicroscopy and x-ray absorption spectroscopy at the Mn-K and Mn-L edges. The\npristine film was assigned to a layered edge-sharing Mn3+/4+ oxide with Mn-O\nbond lengths of mainly 1.87 {\\AA} and some at 2.30 {\\AA} as well as Mn-Mn bond\nlengths of 2.87 {\\AA} based on fits to the extended x-ray fine structure. The\ndecrease of the currents at voltages before the onset of the OER followed power\nlaws with three different exponents depending on the number of cycles and the\nTafel slope decreases from 186 \\pm 48 to 114 \\pm 18 mV dec-1 after 100 cycles,\nwhich we interpret in the context of surface coverage with unreacted\nintermediates. Post-mortem microscopy and bulk spectroscopy at the Mn-K edge\nshowed no change of the microstructure, bulk local structure or bulk Mn\nvalence. Yet, the surface region of MnOx oxidized toward Mn4+, which explains\nthe reduction of the currents in agreement with literature. Surprisingly, we\nfind that MnOx reactivates after 30 min at open-circuit (OC), where the\ncurrents and also the Tafel slope increase. Reactivation processes during OC\nare crucial because OC is unavoidable when coupling the electrocatalysts to\nintermittent power sources such as solar energy for sustainable energy\nproduction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Oct 2020 11:04:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-15"}

Here, we\nreport a novel approach to determine the SOFs based on magnetization dynamics\nby means of time-resolved magneto-optic Kerr microscopy. A microwave current in\na narrow Fe/GaAs (001) stripe generates an Oersted field as well as SOFs due to\nthe reduced symmetry at the Fe/GaAs interface, and excites standing spin wave\n(SSW) modes because of the lateral confinement. Due to their different\nsymmetries, the SOFs and the Oersted field generate distinctly different mode\npatterns. Thus it is possible to determine the magnitude of the SOFs from an\nanalysis of the shape of the SSW patterns. Specifically, this method, which is\nconceptually different from previous approaches based on lineshape analysis, is\nphase independent and self-calibrated. It can be used to measure the current\ninduced SOFs in other material systems, e.g., ferromagnetic metal/non-magnetic\nmetal heterostructures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Oct 2020 11:10:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-28"}

The task of this work was the improvement of the\nthermal regime of a standard target for the C18 cyclotron due to a series of\nparallel grooves. Heat transfer experiments with prototypes of targets were\ncarried out on a specially made test bench providing water cooling of its back\nside. A special Plexiglas thermal block was made to study the thermal processes\nin the target. The measurement results show that the above mentioned technique\nof processing the base of the target leads to a significant increase in the\nrate of cooling of the target, which will allow to irradiate at significantly\nhigher proton beam intensities, which in its turn will increase the irradiation\nefficiency and reduce the cost of the final product.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Oct 2020 11:28:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 26 Oct 2020 08:07:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-27"}

A layered material is considered as a modelling system.\n  An elastic-plastic phase-field model and a surfing boundary condition are\nused to study how the crack propagates throughout the material and the\nevolution of the effective toughness as a function of the layer angle. We first\nstudy three idealized situations, where only one property among fracture\ntoughness, Young's modulus and yield strength is heterogeneous whereas the\nothers are uniform. We observe that in the case of toughness and strength\nheterogeneity, the material exhibits anomalous isotropy: the effective\ntoughness is equal to the largest of the point-wise values for any layer angle\nexcept when the layers are parallel to the macroscopic direction of\npropagation. As the layer angle decreases, the crack propagates along the\nbrittle-to-tough interfaces, whereas it goes straight when the layers have\ndifferent yield strength but uniform toughness. We find that smooth deflections\nin the crack path do not induce any overall toughening and that the effective\ntoughness is not proportional to either the cumulated fracture energy or the\ncumulated plastic work. In the case of elastic heterogeneity, the material is\nanisotropic in the sense of the effective toughness, as the latter varies as a\nfunction of the layer angle. Four toughening mechanisms are active: stress\nfluctuations, crack renucleation, plastic dissipation and plastic blunting.\nFinally, we consider a layered medium comprised of compliant-tough-weak and\nstiff-brittle-strong phases, as it is the case for many structural composites.\nWe observe a transition from an interface-dominated to a plasticity-dominated\nfailure regime, as the phase constituents become more ductile.

Based on these\nfindings, we describe a NeuralDB architecture that runs multiple Neural SPJ\noperators in parallel, each with a set of database sentences that can produce\none of the answers to the query.

We focus on data collection and evaluation of algorithm\nperformance in the context of estimating the density of stromal tumor\ninfiltrating lymphocytes (sTILs) in breast cancer. Methods: We digitized 64\nglass slides of hematoxylin- and eosin-stained ductal carcinoma core biopsies\nprepared at a single clinical site. We created training materials and workflows\nto crowdsource pathologist image annotations on two modes: an optical\nmicroscope and two digital platforms. The workflows collect the ROI type, a\ndecision on whether the ROI is appropriate for estimating the density of sTILs,\nand if appropriate, the sTIL density value for that ROI. Results: The pilot\nstudy yielded an abundant number of cases with nominal sTIL infiltration.\nFurthermore, we found that the sTIL densities are correlated within a case, and\nthere is notable pathologist variability. Consequently, we outline plans to\nimprove our ROI and case sampling methods. We also outline statistical methods\nto account for ROI correlations within a case and pathologist variability when\nvalidating an algorithm. Conclusion: We have built workflows for efficient data\ncollection and tested them in a pilot study.

To tackle the challenge\nof infinite design variables arising from the continuous-time UAV trajectory\noptimization, a commonly adopted approach is by approximating the UAV\ntrajectory with piecewise-linear path segments in three-dimensional (3D) space.\nHowever, this approach may still incur prohibitive computational complexity in\npractice when the UAV flight period/distance becomes long, as the distance\nbetween consecutive waypoints needs to be kept sufficiently small to retain\nhigh approximation accuracy. To resolve this fundamental issue, we propose in\nthis paper a new and general framework for UAV trajectory and communication\nco-design. First, we propose a flexible path discretization scheme that\noptimizes only a number of selected waypoints (designable waypoints) along the\nUAV path for complexity reduction, while all the designable and non-designable\nwaypoints are used in calculating the approximated communication utility along\nthe UAV trajectory for ensuring high trajectory discretization accuracy. Next,\ngiven any number of designable waypoints, we propose a novel path compression\nscheme where the UAV 3D path is first decomposed into three one-dimensional\n(1D) sub-paths and each sub-path is then approximated by superimposing a number\nof selected basis paths weighted by their corresponding path coefficients, thus\nfurther reducing the path design complexity. Finally, we provide a case study\non UAV trajectory design for aerial data harvesting from distributed ground\nsensors, and numerically show that the proposed schemes can significantly\nreduce the UAV trajectory design complexity yet achieve favorable rate\nperformance as compared to conventional path/time discretization schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Oct 2020 13:17:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-15"}

As such, these are usually treated as \"black\nbox\" machines that lack any kind of interpretability. A constructive remedy to\nthis drawback is a systematic design of such networks by unfolding\nwell-understood iterative algorithms. A popular representative of this approach\nis the Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA) and its learned\nversion -- LISTA, aiming for the sparse representations of the processed\nsignals. In this paper we revisit this sparse coding task and propose an\nunfolded version of a greedy pursuit algorithm for the same goal. More\nspecifically, we concentrate on the well-known Orthogonal-Matching-Pursuit\n(OMP) algorithm, and introduce its unfolded and learned version.

In this paper, we\npropose AutoADR (Automatic model design for AD Relevance) -- a novel end-to-end\nframework to address this challenge, and share our experience to ship these\ncutting-edge techniques into online Ad Relevance system at Microsoft Bing.\nSpecifically, AutoADR leverages a one-shot neural architecture search algorithm\nto find a tailored network architecture for Ad Relevance.

However,\nusers must trust their cloud provider with the confidentiality and integrity of\nthe stored and processed data. To increase the protection of virtual machines,\nAMD introduced SEV, a hardware feature which aims to protect code and data in a\nvirtual machine. This allows to store and process sensitive data in cloud\nenvironments without the need to trust the cloud provider or the underlying\nsoftware. However, the virtual machine still depends on the hypervisor for\nperforming certain activities, such as the emulation of special CPU\ninstructions, or the emulation of devices. Yet, most code that runs in virtual\nmachines was not written with an attacker model which considers the hypervisor\nas malicious. In this work, we introduce a new class of attacks in which a\nmalicious hypervisor manipulates external interfaces of an SEV or SEV-ES\nvirtual machine to make it act against its own interests. We start by showing\nhow we can make use of virtual devices to extract encryption keys and secret\ndata of a virtual machine. We then show how we can reduce the entropy of\nprobabilistic kernel defenses in the virtual machine by carefully manipulating\nthe results of the CPUID and RDTSC instructions.

Specifically, we consider algebraically decaying\nsuperconducting pairing amplitudes; the exponent of this decay is found to\ndetermine a critical pairing strength, below which the chain remains\ntopologically trivial. Above the critical pairing, topological edge modes are\nobserved in the central gap. For sufficiently fast decay of the pairing, these\nmodes are identified as Majorana zero-modes. However, if the pairing term\ndecays slowly, the modes become massive Dirac modes. Interestingly, these\nmassive modes still exhibit a true level crossing at zero energy, which points\ntowards an initimate relation to Majorana physics. We also observe a clear lack\nof bulk-boundary correspondence in the long-range system, where bulk\ntopological invariants remain constant, while dramatic changes appear in the\nbehavior at the edge of the system. In addition to the central gap around zero\nenergy, the Aubry-Andr\\'e-Harper potential also leads to other energy gaps at\nnon-zero energy. As for the analogous short-range model, the edge modes in\nthese gaps can be characterized through a 2D Chern invariant.

This type of flux modulation\nhints at periodic physical processes that result in emission. CTA 102, a flat\nspectrum radio quasar at $z=1.032$, has displayed significant activity since\n2016. The multi-waveband light curve of CTA 102 shows signs of quasi-periodic\noscillations during the 2016-2017 flare. Our goal is to quantify the presence\nof any periodicity in the emitted flux during the mentioned period and to\nexplore the causes that can give rise to it. Techniques such as the\nLomb-Scargle periodogram and weighted wavelet z-transform were employed to\nobserve the power emitted at different frequencies. To quantify the\nsignificance of the dominant period, Monte-Carlo techniques were employed\nconsidering an underlying smooth bending power-law model for the power\nspectrum. In addition, the light curve was modeled using an autoregressive\nprocess to analytically obtain the significance of the dominant period. Lastly,\nthe light curve was modeled using a generalized autoregressive integrated\nmoving average process to check whether introducing a periodic component\nresults in a statistically preferable model. Significant, simultaneous\nquasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) were observed in the $\\gamma$-ray and\noptical fluxes of blazar CTA 102 during its 2016-2017 flare. The periodic flux\nmodulation had a dominant period of $\\sim$ 7.6 days and lasted for $\\sim$ 8\ncycles (MJD 57710-57770). All of the methods used point toward significant\n($>4\\sigma$) quasi-periodic modulation in both $\\gamma$-ray and optical fluxes.\nSeveral possible models were explored while probing the origin of the\nperiodicity, and by extension, the 2016--2017 optical flare. The best\nexplanation for the detected QPO appears to be a region of enhanced emission,\nmoving helically inside the jet.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Oct 2020 14:53:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-15"}

Due to the complexity of spatial and temporal dependencies between\ndifferent brain areas, fully comprehending the interplay between structure and\nfunction is still challenging and an area of intense research. In this paper we\npresent a graph neural network (GNN) framework, to describe functional\ninteractions based on the structural anatomical layout. A GNN allows us to\nprocess graph-structured spatio-temporal signals, providing a possibility to\ncombine structural information derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with\ntemporal neural activity profiles, like observed in functional magnetic\nresonance imaging (fMRI). Moreover, dynamic interactions between different\nbrain regions learned by this data-driven approach can provide a multi-modal\nmeasure of causal connectivity strength. We assess the proposed model's\naccuracy by evaluating its capabilities to replicate empirically observed\nneural activation profiles, and compare the performance to those of a vector\nauto regression (VAR), like typically used in Granger causality. We show that\nGNNs are able to capture long-term dependencies in data and also\ncomputationally scale up to the analysis of large-scale networks. Finally we\nconfirm that features learned by a GNN can generalize across MRI scanner types\nand acquisition protocols, by demonstrating that the performance on small\ndatasets can be improved by pre-training the GNN on data from an earlier and\ndifferent study. We conclude that the proposed multi-modal GNN framework can\nprovide a novel perspective on the structure-function relationship in the\nbrain. Therewith this approach can be promising for the characterization of the\ninformation flow in brain networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Oct 2020 15:01:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-15"}

This is especially true for high-resolution phase-contrast\nimaging of materials, but electron scattering simulations based on atomistic\nmodels are widely used in materials science and structural biology. Since\nelectron scattering is dominated by the nuclear cores, the scattering potential\nis typically described by the widely applied independent atom model. This\napproximation is fast and fairly accurate, especially for scanning TEM (STEM)\nannular dark-field contrast, but it completely neglects valence bonding and its\neffect on the transmitting electrons. However, an emerging trend in electron\nmicroscopy is to use new instrumentation and methods to extract the maximum\namount of information from each electron. This is evident in the increasing\npopularity of techniques such as 4D-STEM combined with ptychography in\nmaterials science, and cryogenic microcrystal electron diffraction in\nstructural biology, where subtle differences in the scattering potential may be\nboth measurable and contain additional insights. Thus, there is increasing\ninterest in electron scattering simulations based on electrostatic potentials\nobtained from first principles, mainly via density functional theory, which was\npreviously mainly required for holography. In this Review, we discuss the\nmotivation and basis for these developments, survey the pioneering work that\nhas been published thus far, and give our outlook for the future.

In this paper, instead of training high-dimensional models, we propose\nMulDE, a novel knowledge distillation framework, which includes multiple\nlow-dimensional hyperbolic KGE models as teachers and two student components,\nnamely Junior and Senior. Under a novel iterative distillation strategy, the\nJunior component, a low-dimensional KGE model, asks teachers actively based on\nits preliminary prediction results, and the Senior component integrates\nteachers' knowledge adaptively to train the Junior component based on two\nmechanisms: relation-specific scaling and contrast attention. The experimental\nresults show that MulDE can effectively improve the performance and training\nspeed of low-dimensional KGE models. The distilled 32-dimensional model is\ncompetitive compared to the state-of-the-art high-dimensional methods on\nseveral widely-used datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Oct 2020 15:09:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Oct 2020 09:33:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 27 Mar 2021 14:29:34 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 1 Apr 2021 08:09:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-02"}

Class selectivity-the\nvariability of a unit's responses across data classes or dimensions-is one way\nof quantifying the sparsity of semantic representations. Given recent evidence\nthat class selectivity may not be necessary for, and in some cases can impair\ngeneralization, we investigate whether it also confers robustness (or\nvulnerability) to perturbations of input data. We found that networks\nregularized to have lower levels of class selectivity were more robust to\naverage-case (naturalistic) perturbations, while networks with higher class\nselectivity are more vulnerable. In contrast, class selectivity increases\nrobustness to multiple types of worst-case (i.e. white box adversarial)\nperturbations, suggesting that while decreasing class selectivity is helpful\nfor average-case perturbations, it is harmful for worst-case perturbations. To\nexplain this difference, we studied the dimensionality of the networks'\nrepresentations: we found that the dimensionality of early-layer\nrepresentations is inversely proportional to a network's class selectivity, and\nthat adversarial samples cause a larger increase in early-layer dimensionality\nthan corrupted samples. Furthermore, the input-unit gradient is more variable\nacross samples and units in high-selectivity networks compared to\nlow-selectivity networks. These results lead to the conclusion that units\nparticipate more consistently in low-selectivity regimes compared to\nhigh-selectivity regimes, effectively creating a larger attack surface and\nhence vulnerability to worst-case perturbations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Oct 2020 00:45:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Mar 2021 22:49:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-31"}

We apply this to the task of camera-based\nphysiological measurement. A convolutional attention network is used to learn\nwhich regions of a video contain the physiological signal and generate a\npreliminary estimate. A noise estimate is obtained by using the pixel\nintensities in the inverse regions of the learned attention mask, this in turn\nis used to refine the estimate of the physiological signal. We perform\nexperiments on two large benchmark datasets and show that this approach\nproduces state-of-the-art results, increasing the signal-to-noise ratio by up\nto 5.8 dB, reducing heart rate and breathing rate estimation error by as much\nas 30%, recovering subtle pulse waveform dynamics, and generalizing from RGB to\nNIR videos without retraining.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Oct 2020 13:51:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-16"}

The key idea is to constrain the activation and weight values\nof all layers uniformly to be within the range [-1, 1] and produce low\nbit-width logarithmic representation. With the uniform representations, we\ndevise a unified, reusable CNN computing kernel and significantly reduce\ncomputing resources. The proposed approach has been extensively evaluated on\nmany popular image classification CNN models (AlexNet, VGG16, and ResNet-18/34)\nand object detection models (Yolov2).

The key obstacle in composing\nlight-fields from exposures taken by a plenoptic camera is to computationally\ncalibrate, align and rearrange four-dimensional image data. Several attempts\nhave been proposed to enhance the overall image quality by tailoring pipelines\ndedicated to particular plenoptic cameras and improving the consistency across\nviewpoints at the expense of high computational loads. The framework presented\nherein advances prior outcomes thanks to its novel micro image scale-space\nanalysis for generic camera calibration independent of the lens specifications\nand its parallax-invariant, cost-effective viewpoint color equalization from\noptimal transport theory. Artifacts from the sensor and micro lens grid are\ncompensated in an innovative way to enable superior quality in sub-aperture\nimage extraction, computational refocusing and Scheimpflug rendering with\nsub-sampling capabilities.
