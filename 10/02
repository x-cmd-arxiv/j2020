Such formulations correspond to determining an optimal\nflow in a network. One particular class of network flow formulations is the arc\nflow, where variables represent flows on individual arcs of the network. For\n$\\mathcal{NP}$-hard problems, polynomial-sized arc flow models typically\nprovide weak linear relaxations and may have too much symmetry to be efficient\nin practice. Instead, arc flow models with a pseudo-polynomial size usually\nprovide strong relaxations and are efficient in practice. The interest in\npseudo-polynomial arc flow formulations has grown considerably in the last\ntwenty years, in which they have been used to solve many open instances of hard\nproblems. A remarkable advantage of pseudo-polynomial arc flow models is the\npossibility to solve practical-sized instances directly by a Mixed Integer\nLinear Programming solver, avoiding the implementation of complex methods based\non column generation.\n  In this survey, we present theoretical foundations of pseudo-polynomial arc\nflow formulations, by showing a relation between their network and Dynamic\nProgramming (DP). This relation allows a better understanding of the strength\nof these formulations, through a link with models obtained by Dantzig-Wolfe\ndecomposition. The relation with DP also allows a new perspective to relate\nstate-space relaxation methods for DP with arc flow models. We also present a\ndual point of view to contrast the linear relaxation of arc flow models with\nthat of models based on paths and cycles. To conclude, we review the main\nsolution methods and applications of arc flow models based on DP in several\ndomains such as cutting, packing, scheduling, and routing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2020 17:23:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Apr 2021 19:50:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-21"}

If one stands at distance $d>0$ and aims at $a\\in \\mathbb{R}^n$, then\nthe dart (modelled by a random vector $X$ in $\\mathbb{R}^n$) hits a random\npoint given by $a+dX$. Next, given a payoff function $f$, one considers $$\n\\sup_a Ef(a+dX) $$ and asks if this is decreasing in $d$; i.e., whether it is\nbetter to stand closer rather than farther from the target. Perhaps\nsurprisingly, this is not always the case and understanding when this does or\ndoes not occur is the purpose of this paper.\n  We show that if $X$ has a so-called selfdecomposable distribution, then it is\nalways better to stand closer for any payoff function. This class includes all\nstable distributions as well as many more.\n  On the other hand, if the payoff function is $\\cos(x)$, then it is always\nbetter to stand closer if and only if the characteristic function $|\\phi_X(t)|$\nis decreasing on $[0,\\infty)$. We will then show that if there are at least two\npoint masses, then it is not always better to stand closer using $\\cos(x)$.

This will be obtained by using the fact\nthat the Fourier transform of such distributions has a zero in the complex\nplane.

Time series are\nparticularly interesting because they allow us to visualize and understand the\nevolution of a process over time. Their analysis can reveal trends,\nrelationships and similarities across the data. There exists numerous fields\ncontaining data in the form of time series: health care (electrocardiogram,\nblood sugar, etc.), activity recognition, remote sensing, finance (stock market\nprice), industry (sensors), etc. Time series classification consists of\nconstructing algorithms dedicated to automatically label time series data. The\nsequential aspect of time series data requires the development of algorithms\nthat are able to harness this temporal property, thus making the existing\noff-the-shelf machine learning models for traditional tabular data suboptimal\nfor solving the underlying task. In this context, deep learning has emerged in\nrecent years as one of the most effective methods for tackling the supervised\nclassification task, particularly in the field of computer vision. The main\nobjective of this thesis was to study and develop deep neural networks\nspecifically constructed for the classification of time series data.

We derive a differentiable,\nupper bound on a price of anarchy that agents can cheaply estimate during\nlearning. Equipped with this estimator, agents can adjust their incentives in a\nway that improves the efficiency incurred at a Nash equilibrium. Agents do so\nby learning to mix their reward (equiv. negative loss) with that of other\nagents by following the gradient of our derived upper bound. We refer to this\napproach as D3C.

Contrary to conventional wisdom,\nhowever, individual-level polarization is rare; the system-level shift in 2016\nwas disproportionately driven by the arrival of new and newly political users.\nPolitical polarization on Reddit is unrelated to previous activity on the\nplatform, and is instead temporally aligned with external events.

When\ndeployed on battery-powered mobile devices, efficient computer architectures\nare required to enable fast and energy-efficient computation of costly\nconvolution operations. Despite recent advances in hardware accelerator design\nfor CNNs, two major problems have not yet been addressed effectively,\nparticularly when the convolution layers have highly diverse structures: (1)\nminimizing energy-hungry off-chip DRAM data movements; (2) maximizing the\nutilization factor of processing resources to perform convolutions. This work\nthus proposes an energy-efficient architecture equipped with several optimized\ndataflows to support the structural diversity of modern CNNs. The proposed\napproach is evaluated by implementing convolutional layers of VGGNet-16 and\nResNet-50. Results show that the architecture achieves a Processing Element\n(PE) utilization factor of 98% for the majority of 3x3 and 1x1 convolutional\nlayers, while limiting latency to 396.9 ms and 92.7 ms when performing\nconvolutional layers of VGGNet-16 and ResNet-50, respectively.

In this work, we propose a heuristic optimization strategy for\nsuch ansatze used in variational quantum algorithms, which we call\n\"Parameter-Efficient Circuit Training\" (PECT). Instead of optimizing all of the\nansatz parameters at once, PECT launches a sequence of variational algorithms,\nin which each iteration of the algorithm activates and optimizes a subset of\nthe total parameter set. To update the parameter subset between iterations, we\nadapt the dynamic sparse reparameterization scheme by Mostafa et al.\n(arXiv:1902.05967).

We additionally use a\nlayerwise variant of PECT to optimize a hardware-efficient circuit for the\nSycamore processor to estimate the ground state energy densities of the\none-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model. From our numerical data, we find that PECT\ncan enable optimizations of certain ansatze that were previously difficult to\nconverge and more generally can improve the performance of variational\nalgorithms by reducing the optimization runtime and/or the depth of circuits\nthat encode the solution candidate(s).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2020 18:14:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-30"}

An important role is played by a\nsmall boundary layer where intense growth is observed. Several simplified\nmodels of the scenario have been considered, all leading to finite time blow up\n\\cite{CKY15,CHKLVY17,HORY,KT1,HL15,KY1}.

However, sampling from them requires\nexpensive Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) iterations that mix slowly in high\ndimensional pixel space. Unlike EBMs, variational autoencoders (VAEs) generate\nsamples quickly and are equipped with a latent space that enables fast\ntraversal of the data manifold. However, VAEs tend to assign high probability\ndensity to regions in data space outside the actual data distribution and often\nfail at generating sharp images. In this paper, we propose VAEBM, a symbiotic\ncomposition of a VAE and an EBM that offers the best of both worlds. VAEBM\ncaptures the overall mode structure of the data distribution using a\nstate-of-the-art VAE and it relies on its EBM component to explicitly exclude\nnon-data-like regions from the model and refine the image samples. Moreover,\nthe VAE component in VAEBM allows us to speed up MCMC updates by\nreparameterizing them in the VAE's latent space.

Our plans focus on the development of the\n`Dragonfly Filter-Tilter', a device which places ultra-narrow bandpass\ninterference filters ($\\Delta\\lambda \\approx 1$ nm) in front of each of the\nlenses that make up the array. The filters are at the entrance pupil of the\noptical system, rather than in a converging beam, so their performance is not\ndegraded by a converging light cone. This allows Dragonfly to image with a\nspectral bandpass that is an order of magnitude narrower than that of\ntelescopes using conventional narrow-band filters, resulting in a large\nincrease in the contrast and detectability of extended low surface brightness\nline emission. By tilting the filters, the central wavelength of the\ntransmission curve can be tuned over a range of 7 nm, corresponding to a\nphysical distance range of about 20 Mpc of extragalactic targets. A further\nbenefit of our approach is that it allows off-band observations to be obtained\nat the same time as on-band observations, so systematic errors introduced by\nrapid sky variability can be removed with high precision. Taken together, these\ncharacteristics should give our imaging system the ability to detect extremely\nfaint low-surface brightness line emission. Future versions of the Dragonfly\nTelephoto Array may have the sensitivity needed to directly image the\ncircumgalactic medium of local galaxies. In this paper, we provide a detailed\ndescription of the concept, and present laboratory measurements that are used\nto verify the key ideas behind the instrument.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2020 21:10:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-05"}

It is argued that Beresnyak's objection that Boldyrev's alignment\ntheory violates the RMHD rescaling symmetry can be reconciled with alignment if\nthe latter is understood as an intermittency effect. Boldyrev's scalings,\nrecovered in this interpretation, are thus an example of a physical theory of\nintermittency in a turbulent system. Emergence of aligned structures brings in\nreconnection physics, so the theory of MHD turbulence intertwines with the\nphysics of tearing and current-sheet disruption. Recent work on this by\nLoureiro, Mallet et al. is reviewed and it is argued that we finally have a\nreasonably complete picture of MHD cascade all the way to the dissipation\nscale. This picture appears to reconcile Beresnyak's Kolmogorov scaling of the\ndissipation cutoff with Boldyrev's aligned cascade. These ideas also enable\nsome progress in understanding saturated MHD dynamo, argued to be controlled by\nreconnection and to contain, at small scales, a tearing-mediated cascade\nsimilar to its strong-mean-field counterpart. On the margins of this core\nnarrative, standard weak-MHD-turbulence theory is argued to require adjustment\n- and a scheme for it is proposed - to take account of the part that a\nspontaneously emergent 2D condensate plays in mediating the Alfven-wave\ncascade.

A\nnumber of outstanding issues are surveyed, concerning imbalanced MHD turbulence\n(for which a new theory is proposed), residual energy, subviscous and decaying\nregimes of MHD turbulence (where reconnection again features prominently).\nFinally, it is argued that the natural direction of research is now away from\nMHD and into kinetic territory.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2020 21:52:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 17 Jul 2021 21:51:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 19 Jul 2022 22:41:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-07-21"}

In the case of the hard wall model, the\nthermal transition takes place in the planar AdS thanks to the introduction of\nan infrared cut-off in the geometry. The corresponding thermodynamic entropy of\nthe $SU(N) $ gauge theory jumps from proportional to $N^0$ in the confined\nhadronic phase to proportional to $N^2$ in the plasma phase, corresponding to\nthe presence of the color degrees of freedom. The Hawking-Page transition is\nunderstood by considering a semiclassical picture of a system consisting of two\ndifferent geometries that are asymptotically AdS. One is the AdS black hole and\nthe other the thermal AdS space. The relative stability between these competing\ngeometries varies with the temperature. So, the transition is essentially a\nproblem of stability. An interesting tool to study stability of physical\nsystems is the configuration entropy (CE), inspired in the Shannon\ninformational entropy. In this work we investigate the CE for the case of the\nAdS/QCD hard wall model at finite temperature.

While theoretically sound,\nfollowing this recommendation can lead to high computational costs when a\npipeline modeling algorithm includes computationally expensive operations, e.g.\nimputation of missing values. There is a general belief that unsupervised\nvariable selection (i.e. ignoring the outcome) can be applied before conducting\nCV without incurring bias, but there is less consensus for unsupervised\nimputation of missing values. We empirically assessed whether conducting\nunsupervised imputation prior to CV would result in biased estimates of\ngeneralization error or result in poorly selected tuning parameters and thus\ndegrade the external performance of downstream models. Results show that\ndespite optimistic bias, the reduced variance of imputation before CV compared\nto imputation during each replicate of CV leads to a lower overall root mean\nsquared error for estimation of the true external R-squared and the performance\nof models tuned using CV with imputation before versus during each replication\nis minimally different.

However, the\npredominant load balancing scheme in data center networks, equal-cost\nmulti-path (ECMP), is agnostic to path conditions and performs poorly in\nasymmetric topologies, resulting in low throughput and high latencies. In this\npaper, we propose CAFT, a distributed congestion-aware fault-tolerant load\nbalancing protocol for 3-tier data center networks. It first collects, in real\ntime, the complete congestion information of two subsets from the set of all\npossible paths between any two hosts.

Consequently, traditional\nquery optimizers tend to ignore or miscalculate those settings, thus leading to\nsuboptimal execution plans. Given the volume of today's data, a suboptimal plan\ncan quickly become very inefficient.\n  In this work, we revisit the old idea of runtime dynamic optimization and\nadapt it to a shared-nothing distributed database system, AsterixDB. The\noptimization runs in stages (re-optimization points), starting by first\nexecuting all predicates local to a single dataset. The intermediate result\ncreated from each stage is used to re-optimize the remaining query. This\nre-optimization approach avoids inaccurate intermediate result cardinality\nestimations, thus leading to much better execution plans. While it introduces\nthe overhead for materializing these intermediate results, our experiments show\nthat this overhead is relatively small and it is an acceptable price to pay\ngiven the optimization benefits. In fact, our experimental evaluation shows\nthat runtime dynamic optimization leads to much better execution plans as\ncompared to the current default AsterixDB plans as well as to plans produced by\nstatic cost-based optimization (i.e. based on the initial dataset statistics)\nand other state-of-the-art approaches.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2020 23:42:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 5 Oct 2020 19:30:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-07"}

On the other hand, the flux in anisotropic\nturbulence should be a geometric vector that has a direction as well as the\nmagnitude, and depends not only on the magnitude of the wavenumber but also on\nits direction. The energy-flux vector in the anisotropic turbulence cannot be\nuniquely determined in a way used for the isotropic flux. In this work,\nintroducing two ansatzes, net locality and efficiency of the nonlinear energy\ntransfer, we propose a way to determine the energy-flux vector in anisotropic\nturbulence by using the Moore--Penrose inverse. The energy-flux vector in\nstrongly rotating turbulence is demonstrated based on the energy transfer rate\nobtained by direct numerical simulations. It is found that the direction of the\nenergy-flux vector is consistent with the prediction of the weak turbulence\ntheory in the wavenumber range dominated by the inertial waves. However, the\nenergy flux along the critical wavenumbers predicted by the critical balance in\nthe buffer range between in the weak turbulence range and the isotropic\nKolmogorov turbulence range is not observed in the present simulations. This\ndiscrepancy between the critical balance and the present numerical results is\ndiscussed and the dissipation is found to play an important role in the energy\nflux in the buffer range.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Oct 2020 01:11:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-08"}

To achieve internationally agreed\ntargets for HIV control and elimination, test-and-treat prevention efforts have\nbeen dramatically intensified over the period 2010-2015, and, from 2016,\nfurther strengthened by pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP).\n  Methods: Application of a novel age-stratified back-calculation approach to\ndata on new HIV diagnoses and CD4 count-at-diagnosis, enabled age-specific\nestimation of HIV incidence, undiagnosed infections and mean time-to-diagnosis\nacross both the 2010-2015 and 2016-2018 periods. Estimated incidence trends\nwere then extrapolated, to quantify the likelihood of achieving HIV elimination\nby 2030.\n  Findings: A fall in HIV incidence in MSM is estimated to have started in\n2012/3, eighteen months before the observed fall in new diagnoses. A steep\ndecrease from 2,770 annual infections (95% credible interval 2.490-3,040) in\n2013 to 1,740 (1,500-2,010) in 2015 is estimated, followed by steady decline\nfrom 2016, reaching 854 (441-1,540) infections in 2018. A decline is\nconsistently estimated in all age groups, with a fall particularly marked in\nthe 24-35 age group, and slowest in the 45+ group. Comparable declines are\nestimated in the number of undiagnosed infections.\n  Interpretation: The peak and subsequent sharp decline in HIV incidence\noccurred prior to the phase-in of PrEP. Definining elimination as a public\nhealth threat to be < 50 new infections (1.1 infections per 10,000 at risk),\n40% of incidence projections hit this threshold by 2030.

We included a cooling\nprescription controlled by the parameter \\beta = \\Omega t_{cool}, which will\ndetermine how strong the final accretion rate is: a hotter disc is thicker, and\nthe tidal interaction is suppressed for the gas outside the binary plane.

Experiments\nwere carried out on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets by using both black-box\nand white-box attacks with various metrics including adaptive ones. The results\nshow that the proposed defense achieves high accuracy close to that of using\nclean images even under adaptive attacks for the first time. In the best-case\nscenario, a model trained by using images transformed by FFX Encryption (block\nsize of 4) yielded an accuracy of 92.30% on clean images and 91.48% under PGD\nattack with a noise distance of 8/255, which is close to the non-robust\naccuracy (95.45%) for the CIFAR-10 dataset, and it yielded an accuracy of\n72.18% on clean images and 71.43% under the same attack, which is also close to\nthe standard accuracy (73.70%) for the ImageNet dataset. Overall, all three\nproposed algorithms are demonstrated to outperform state-of-the-art defenses\nincluding adversarial training whether or not a model is under attack.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Oct 2020 06:07:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-05"}

The networks operate on unordered point clouds and provide invariance to\nsimilarity transformations, avoiding the need to identify point correspondences\nbetween shapes. Based on the framework, we assemble a discriminative model for\ndisease classification and age regression, as well as a generative model for\nthe accruate reconstruction of shapes. In particular, we propose a conditional\ngenerative model, where the condition vector provides a mechanism to control\nthe generative process. instance, it enables to assess shape variations\nspecific to a particular diagnosis, when passing it as side information. Next\nto working on single shapes, we introduce an extension for the joint analysis\nof multiple anatomical structures, where the simultaneous modeling of multiple\nstructures can lead to a more compact encoding and a better understanding of\ndisorders. We demonstrate the advantages of our framework in comprehensive\nexperiments on real and synthetic data.

The effect opens a\npossibility of driving transitions between various topological phases of the\nsystem by magnetic field or by the spontaneous Mn magnetization. We also\npropose a new method to calculate topological indices for systems with a finite\nspin polarization defined based on the concept of the Chern number. These valid\ntopological characteristics enable an identification of the three distinct\ntopological phases of the Pb$_{1-x-y}$Sn$_x$Mn$_y$Te alloy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Oct 2020 09:03:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-20"}

To solve this problem, we\nintroduce new self-supervised learning (SSL) mechanism to obtain the\nhigh-performance pre-training model for RSIs scene classification from large\nunlabeled data. Experiments on three commonly used RSIs scene classification\ndatasets demonstrated that this new learning paradigm outperforms the\ntraditional dominant ImageNet pre-trained model.

The insights distilled\nfrom our studies can help to foster the development of SSL in the remote\nsensing community.

In this regard, a major challenge is to ensure a\nrobust and stable control system over an unreliable wireless channel. One of\nthe main use-cases in this context is Automated Guided Vehicle (AGV) control in\na future factory. Specifically, we consider a system where an AGV controller is\nplaced in an edge cloud in the factory network infrastructure and the control\ncommands are sent over a time-correlated Rayleigh fading channel. In an\nindustrial control, short packets are exchanged between the controller and the\nactuator. Therefore, in this case, Shannon's assumption for an infinite block\nlength is not applicable. The objective is to analyse the stability performance\nof an AGV control system in a Finite Block-Length (FBL) regime. We evaluate the\ncoding rate required to maintain a stable edge cloud based AGV system. The\nresults illustrate that adapting the control parameters can lower the stringent\nrequirements on the coding rate. It reveals that a constant stability\nperformance can be achieved even at higher coding rate by increasing the AGV's\nvelocity. Moreover, this paper also determines the maximum number of AGVs that\ncan be served seamlessly over the available communication resources while\nmaintaining a stable control system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Oct 2020 09:29:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-05"}

We investigate the magnetospheric accretion process in the young\nstellar system DoAr 44. We monitored the system over several rotational cycles,\ncombining high-resolution optical and near-IR spectropolarimetry with\nlong-baseline near-IR interferometry and multicolor photometry. DoAr 44 is a\nyoung 1.2 solar mass star, moderately accreting from its disk, and seen at a\nlow inclination. We derive a rotational period of 2.96 d from the system's\nlight curve. Several optical and near-IR line profiles probing the accretion\nfunnel flows and the accretion shock are modulated at the stellar rotation\nperiod. The most variable line profile, HeI 1083 nm, exhibits modulated\nredshifted wings a signature of accretion funnel flows, as well as deep\nblueshifted absorptions indicative of transient outflows. The Zeeman-Doppler\nanalysis suggests the star hosts a mainly dipolar magnetic field, inclined by\nabout 20 deg. onto the spin axis, with an intensity reaching about 800 G at the\nphotosphere, and up to 2 +/- 0.8 kG close to the accretion shock. The magnetic\nfield appears strong enough to disrupt the inner disk close to the corotation\nradius, at a distance of about 4.6 stellar radii (0.043 au). This supports the\nupper limit of 5 stellar radii (0.047 au) we derived for the size of the\nmagnetosphere from long baseline interferometry. DoAr 44 is a pre-transitional\ndisk system, exhibiting a 25-30 au gap in its circumstellar disk, with the\ninner and outer disks being misaligned. On a scale of 0.1 au or less, our\nresults indicate that the system steadily accretes from its inner disk through\nits tilted dipolar magnetosphere.

In the majority of these results it is assumed that the\ndrift coefficient satisfies piecewise regularity conditions and that the\ndiffusion coefficient is globally Lipschitz continuous and non-degenerate at\nthe discontinuities of the drift coefficient. Under this type of assumptions\nthe best $L_p$-error rate obtained so far for approximation of scalar SDEs at\nthe final time is $3/4$ in terms of the number of evaluations of the driving\nBrownian motion. In the present article we prove for the first time in the\nliterature sharp lower error bounds for such SDEs. We show that for a huge\nclass of additive noise driven SDEs of this type the $L_p$-error rate $3/4$ can\nnot be improved.\n  For the proof of this result we employ a novel technique by studying\nequations with coupled noise: we reduce the analysis of the $L_p$-error of an\narbitrary approximation based on evaluation of the driving Brownian motion at\nfinitely many times to the analysis of the $L_p$-distance of two solutions of\nthe same equation that are driven by Brownian motions that are coupled at the\ngiven time-points and independent, conditioned on their values at these points.\nTo obtain lower bounds for the latter quantity, we prove a new quantitative\nversion of positive association for bivariate normal random variables $(Y,Z)$\nby providing explict lower bounds for the covariance $\\text{Cov}(f(Y),g(Z))$ in\ncase of piecewise Lipschitz continuous functions $f$ and $g$.

This review aims to give first-order\nestimates and sensitivities to answer these questions that are consistent with\nthose obtained from numerical simulation models. The first part describes how\nthermodynamics determines how much wind energy the atmosphere is physically\ncapable of generating at large scales from the solar radiative forcing. The\nwork done to generate and maintain large-scale atmospheric motion can be seen\nas the consequence of an atmospheric heat engine, which is driven by the\ndifference in solar radiative heating between the tropics and the poles. The\nresulting motion transports heat, which depletes this differential solar\nheating and the associated, large-scale temperature difference. This\ninteraction between the thermodynamic driver and the resulting dynamics leads\nto a maximum in the global mean kinetic energy generation rate of about 1.7 W\nm$^{-2}$, which matches rates inferred from observations of about 2.1 - 2.5 W\nm$^{-2}$ very well. The second part focuses on the limits of converting the\nkinetic energy of the atmosphere into renewable energy. The momentum balance of\nthe lower atmosphere shows that at large-scales, only a fraction of about 26%\nof the kinetic energy can at most be converted to renewable energy, yielding a\ntypical resource potential of about 0.5 W m$^{-2}$ per surface area. The\napparent discrepancy with much higher yields of small wind farms can be\nexplained by the spatial scale of about 100 km at which kinetic energy near the\nsurface is being dissipated and replenished.

The residuals of the\nMVDR are uncorrelated with other cluster properties like temperature, cluster\nradius, baryonic mass surface density, and redshift. These characteristics are\nreminiscent of the MVDR for individual galaxies, albeit about ten times larger\ncharacteristic acceleration scale. The cluster baryon fraction falls short of\nthe cosmic value, exposing a problem: the discrepancy increases systematically\nfor clusters of lower mass and lower baryonic acceleration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Oct 2020 13:37:17 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 9 Feb 2021 06:45:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-31"}

Aims. The aim is to\nconstrain the TP profile of the ultra-hot Jupiter KELT-9b by fitting synthetic\nspectra to the observed H$\\alpha$ and H$\\beta$ lines and identify why\nself-consistent planetary TP models are unable to fit the observations.\nMethods. We construct 126 one-dimensional TP profiles varying the lower and\nupper atmospheric temperatures, as well as the location and gradient of the\ntemperature rise. For each TP profile, we compute transmission spectra of the\nH$\\alpha$ and H$\\beta$ lines employing the Cloudy radiative transfer code,\nwhich self-consistently accounts for non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE)\neffects. Results. The TP profiles leading to best fit the observations are\ncharacterised by an upper atmospheric temperature of 10000-11000 K and by an\ninverted temperature profile at pressures higher than 10$^{-4}$ bar. We find\nthat the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) leads to\noverestimate the level population of excited hydrogen by several orders of\nmagnitude, and hence to significantly overestimate the strength of the Balmer\nlines. The chemical composition of the best fitting models indicate that the\nhigh upper atmospheric temperature is most likely driven by metal\nphotoionisation and that FeII and FeIII have comparable abundances at pressures\nlower than 10$^{-6}$ bar, possibly making the latter detectable. Conclusions.\nModelling the atmospheres of ultra-hot Jupiters requires one to account for\nmetal photoionisation.

The T_1\nanisotropy is found to be inconsistent with existing neutron scattering data in\nFeSe, showing that the spin fluctuation spectrum reveals surprises at low\nenergy, possibly from fluctuations that do not break C_4 symmetry.

By learning to embed two augmented versions of\nthe same image close to each other and to push the embeddings of different\nimages apart, one can train highly transferable visual representations. As\nrevealed by recent studies, heavy data augmentation and large sets of negatives\nare both crucial in learning such representations. At the same time, data\nmixing strategies either at the image or the feature level improve both\nsupervised and semi-supervised learning by synthesizing novel examples, forcing\nnetworks to learn more robust features. In this paper, we argue that an\nimportant aspect of contrastive learning, i.e., the effect of hard negatives,\nhas so far been neglected. To get more meaningful negative samples, current top\ncontrastive self-supervised learning approaches either substantially increase\nthe batch sizes, or keep very large memory banks; increasing the memory size,\nhowever, leads to diminishing returns in terms of performance. We therefore\nstart by delving deeper into a top-performing framework and show evidence that\nharder negatives are needed to facilitate better and faster learning. Based on\nthese observations, and motivated by the success of data mixing, we propose\nhard negative mixing strategies at the feature level, that can be computed\non-the-fly with a minimal computational overhead. We exhaustively ablate our\napproach on linear classification, object detection and instance segmentation\nand show that employing our hard negative mixing procedure improves the quality\nof visual representations learned by a state-of-the-art self-supervised\nlearning method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Oct 2020 14:34:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 4 Dec 2020 11:46:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-07"}

In this paper, we demonstrate that\nthis experimentally observed smooth transition does not require frequently used\na priori assumptions of a continuous distribution of work functions on the\ncathode surface. Instead, we find the smooth transition arises as a natural\nconsequence of the physics of nonuniform thermionic emission from a spatially\nheterogeneous cathode surface.

To address these challenges, this paper\nproposed an automatic deep learning system for COVID-19 infection areas\nsegmentation. The system include different steps to enhance and improve\ninfection areas appearance in the CT slices so they can be learned efficiently\nusing the deep network. The system start prepare the region of interest by\nsegmenting the lung organ, which then undergo edge enhancing diffusion\nfiltering (EED) to improve the infection areas contrast and intensity\nhomogeneity. The proposed FCN is implemented using U-net architecture with\nmodified residual block with concatenation skip connection. The block improves\nthe learning of gradient values by forwarding the infection area features\nthrough the network. To demonstrate the generalization and effectiveness of the\nproposed system, it is trained and tested using many 2D CT slices extracted\nfrom diverse datasets from different sources. The proposed system is evaluated\nusing different measures and achieved dice overlapping score of 0.961 and 0.780\nfor lung and infection areas segmentation, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2020 21:05:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-06"}

As the\nmolecular field we used the chemical potential that for semi-dilute polymer\nsolution can be represented as a virial expansion where we took into account\nonly second and third virial coefficients of the polymer solution. Varying the\nparameters like polymer stiffness, polymer length, polymer concentration and\nsolvent regime (like theta solvent) whether it is for purely repulsive\ncolloidal surface, adsorbed surface or surface with grafted polymer layer we\nwere able to enhance the repulsive barrier due to the free polymers between the\nparticles and therefore found conditions for kinetic stabilization of the\nsystem.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Oct 2020 22:18:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-19"}

It is more reasonable than traditional Multi-Class Classification\nin dealing with some problematic data set or special cases. Generally,\nclassification accuracy and interpretability for user are considered as\ntrade-off in OCC methods. Classifier based on Hyper-Rectangle (H-RTGL) is a\nsort of classifier that can be a remedy for such trade-off and uses H-RTGL\nformulated by conjunction of geometric rules called interval. This interval can\nbe basis of interpretability since it can be easily understood by user.\nHowever, existing H-RTGL based OCC classifiers have limitations that (i) most\nof them cannot reflect density of target class and (ii) that considering\ndensity has primitive interval generation method, and (iii) there exists no\nsystematic procedure for hyperparameter of H-RTGL based OCC classifier, which\ninfluences classification performance of classifier. Based on these remarks, we\nsuggest One-Class Hyper-Rectangle Descriptor based on density (1-HRD_d) with\nmore elaborate interval generation method including parametric and\nnonparametric approaches. In addition, we designed Genetic Algorithm (GA) that\nconsists of chromosome structure and genetic operators for systematic\ngeneration of 1-HRD_d by optimization of hyperparameter. Our work is validated\nthrough a numerical experiment using actual data set with comparison of\nexisting OCC algorithms along with other H-RTGL based classifiers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 2 Oct 2020 04:22:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 2021 07:29:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-26"}
