The proposed algorithms work for any general\nconvex problem and the efficiency is demonstrated by proven upper bounds on\nsimulation costs. The upper bounds demonstrate a polynomial dependence on the\ndimension and scale of the decision space. For some discrete optimization via\nsimulation problems, a gradient estimator may be available at low costs along\nwith a single simulation replication. By integrating gradient estimators, which\nare possibly biased, we propose simulation-optimization algorithms to achieve\noptimality guarantees with a reduced dependence on the dimension under moderate\nassumptions on the bias.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2020 16:34:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2020 03:59:18 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 11 Feb 2022 21:34:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-15"}

In complex systems, the\ncooperative dynamics is largely determined by the network structure which\ndictates the interactions among neighboring individuals. Despite an abundance\nof studies, the role of the network structure in in promoting cooperation\nthrough generalized reciprocity remains an under-explored phenomenon.

We use this framework to present a\ntheoretical overview on the role of generalized reciprocity in promoting\ncooperation in three distinct interaction structures: i) social dilemmas, ii)\nmultidimensional networks, and iii) fluctuating environments. The results\nsuggest that cooperation through generalized reciprocity always emerges as the\nunique attractor in which the overall level of cooperation is maximized, while\nsimultaneously exploitation of the participating individuals is prevented. The\neffect of the network structure is captured by a local centrality measure which\nuniquely quantifies the propensity of the network structure to cooperation, by\ndictating the degree of cooperation displayed both at microscopic and\nmacroscopic level. As a consequence, the implementation of our results may go\nbeyond explaining the evolution of cooperation. In particular, they can be\ndirectly applied in domains that deal with the development of artificial\nsystems able to adequately mimic reality, such as reinforcement learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2020 16:25:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-02"}

The state-of-the-art methods are based on expert-developed\nmodel ensembles from different supervised learning methods. Recently, automated\nmachine learning (AutoML) is emerging as a promising approach to automate\npredictive model development. Neural architecture search (NAS) is an AutoML\napproach that generates and evaluates multiple neural network architectures\nconcurrently and improves the accuracy of the generated models iteratively. A\nkey issue in NAS, particularly for large data sets, is the large computation\ntime required to evaluate each generated architecture.

For different data sets, the data-parallel training settings\nsuch as the number of parallel processes, learning rate, and batch size need to\nbe adapted to achieve high accuracy and reduction in training time. To that\nend, we have developed AgEBO-Tabular, an approach to combine aging evolution\n(AgE), a parallel NAS method that searches over neural architecture space, and\nan asynchronous Bayesian optimization method for tuning the hyperparameters of\nthe data-parallel training simultaneously.

For depinning of elastic manifolds, these are the position of its\ncenter of mass $u$, and the statistics of the forces $F(u)$. There are two\nproposals to model the latter: as a random walk (ABBM model), or as\nuncorrelated forces at integer $u$ (discretized particle model, DPM). While for\nmany experiments ABBM (in the literature misleadingly equated with mean-field\ntheory) makes quantitatively correct predictions, the microscopic disorder\nforce-force correlations cannot grow linearly, and thus unboundedly as a random\nwalk. Even the effective (renormalized) disorder forces which do so at small\ndistances are bounded at large distances. We propose to model forces as an\nOrnstein Uhlenbeck process. The latter behaves as a random walk at small\nscales, and is uncorrelated at large ones. By connecting to results in both\nlimits, we solve the model largely analytically, allowing us to describe in all\nregimes the distributions of velocity, avalanche size and duration. To\nestablish experimental signatures of this transition, we study the response\nfunction, and the correlation function of position $u$, velocity $\\dot u$ and\nforces $F$ under slow driving with velocity $v>0$. While at $v=0$ force or\nposition correlations have a cusp at the origin, this cusp is rounded at a\nfinite driving velocity. We give a detailed analytic analysis for this rounding\nby velocity, which allows us, given experimental data, to extract the\ntime-scale of the response function, and to reconstruct the force-force\ncorrelator at $v=0$.

Internal\ndegrees of freedom are fully taken into account for one component, the primary.\nIn the case of the companion the spin angular momentum is assumed small enough\nto be neglected but internal energy dissipation is allowed for as this can be\nsignificant for orbital circularisation in the case of planetary companions. We\nobtain a set of equations governing the evolution of the orbit resulting from\ntidal effects. These depend on the masses and radii of the binary components,\nthe form and orientation of the orbit, and for each involved component, the\nspin rate, the Coriolis force, the normalised rate of energy dissipation\nassociated with the equilibrium tide due to radiative processes and viscosity,\nand the classical apsidal motion constant. These depend on stellar parameters\nwith no need of additional assumptions or a phenomenological approach as has\nbeen invoked in the past. They can be used to determine the evolution of\nsystems with initial significant misalignment of spin and orbital angular\nmomenta as hypothesised for systems containing Hot Jupiters. The inclusion of\nthe Coriolis force may lead to evolution of the inclination between orbital and\nspin angular momenta and precession of the orbital plane which may have\nobservational consequences.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2020 17:12:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-11"}

The most common concurrency errors are (data) races, which occur\nwhen memory-conflicting actions are executed concurrently. Consequently,\nconsiderable effort has been made towards developing efficient techniques for\nrace detection. The most common approach is dynamic race prediction: given an\nobserved, race-free trace $\\sigma$ of a concurrent program, the task is to\ndecide whether events of $\\sigma$ can be correctly reordered to a trace\n$\\sigma^*$ that witnesses a race hidden in $\\sigma$.\n  In this work we introduce the notion of sync(hronization)-preserving races. A\nsync-preserving race occurs in $\\sigma$ when there is a witness $\\sigma^*$ in\nwhich synchronization operations (e.g., acquisition and release of locks)\nappear in the same order as in $\\sigma$. This is a broad definition that\nstrictly subsumes the famous notion of happens-before races. Our main results\nare as follows. First, we develop a sound and complete algorithm for predicting\nsync-preserving races. For moderate values of parameters like the number of\nthreads, the algorithm runs in $\\widetilde{O}(\\mathcal{N})$ time and space,\nwhere $\\mathcal{N}$ is the length of the trace $\\sigma$. Second, we show that\nthe problem has a $\\Omega(\\mathcal{N}/\\log^2 \\mathcal{N})$ space lower bound,\nand thus our algorithm is essentially time and space optimal. Third, we show\nthat predicting races with even just a single reversal of two sync operations\nis $\\operatorname{NP}$-complete and even $\\operatorname{W}[1]$-hard when\nparameterized by the number of threads. Thus, sync-preservation characterizes\nexactly the tractability boundary of race prediction, and our algorithm is\nnearly optimal for the tractable side.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2020 17:29:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-02"}

Most of them have been\ndiscovered using wide-field imaging surveys. The Virtual Observatory has proven\nto be of great utility to efficiently exploit these astronomical resources. We\naim to validate a Virtual Observatory methodology designed to discover and\ncharacterize ultracool dwarfs in deep extragalactic surveys like ALHAMBRA and\nCOSMOS. Three complementary searches based on parallaxes, proper motions and\ncolours, respectively were carried out. A total of 897 candidate ultracool\ndwarfs were found, with only 16 previously reported in SIMBAD. Most of the new\nUCDs reported here are likely late-M and L dwarfs because of the limitations\nimposed by the utilization of optical ($Gaia$ DR2 and r-band) data. We\ncomplement ALHAMBRA and COSMOS photometry with other catalogues in the optical\nand infrared using VOSA, a Virtual Observatory tool that estimates effective\ntemperatures from the spectral energy distribution fitting to collections of\ntheoretical models. The agreement between the number of UCDs found in the\nCOSMOS field and theoretical estimations together with the low false negative\nrate (known UCDs not discovered in our search) validates the methodology\nproposed in this work, which will be used in the forthcoming wide and deep\nsurveys provided by the Euclid space mission. Simulations of Euclid number\ncounts for UCDs detectable in different photometric passbands are presented for\na wide survey area of 15,000 square degrees, and the limitations of\napplicability of Euclid data to detect UCDs using the methods employed in this\npaper are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2020 17:43:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-23"}

A limited understanding of the CIB contribution at lower frequencies\non the other hand can hinder efforts to measure the kinetic Sunyaev-Zeldovich\nspectrum on small scales as well as new physics that affects the damping tail\nof the cosmic microwave background (CMB). The Planck satellite has measured\nwith high fidelity the CIB at 217, 353, 545 and 857 GHz.

This improvement comes from improved\nknowledge of the redshift distribution of star-forming galaxies as well as\nthrough the use of the unbiased matter density inferred from CMB lensing mass\nmaps to cancel the sample variance in the CIB field.

As expected, more massive haloes\ntend to host larger central galaxies. However, the size of satellite galaxies\ndepends only slightly on halo virial mass. We show that these results are\ncompatible with a remarkably simple model in which the size of central and\nsatellite galaxies scales as the cubic root of their host halo mass, with the\nnormalization for satellites being $\\sim$ 30 \\% smaller than that for central\ngalaxies, which can be attributed to tidal stripping.

For the first time with PSP, this\nincludes a measurement of the alpha particle contribution. The mechanical AM\nflux in the solar wind protons (core and beam), and alpha particles, is\ndetermined as well as the transport of AM through stresses in the\ninterplanetary magnetic field. The solar wind AM flux is averaged over three\nhour increments, so that our findings more accurately represent the bulk flow.\nDuring the third and fourth perihelion passes of PSP, the alpha particles\ncontain around a fifth of the mechanical AM flux in the solar wind (the rest is\ncarried by the protons). The proton beam is found to contain $\\sim 10-50\\%$ of\nthe proton AM flux. The sign of the alpha particle AM flux is observed to\ncorrelate with the proton core. The slow wind has a positive AM flux (removing\nAM from the Sun as expected), and the fast wind has a negative AM flux. As with\nprevious works, the differential velocity between the alpha particles and the\nproton core tends to be aligned with the interplanetary magnetic field. In\nfuture, by utilising the trends in the alpha-proton differential velocity, it\nmay be possible to estimate the alpha particle contribution when only\nmeasurements of the proton core are available.

Additionally, the AM flux of the proton beam can be just\nas significant as the alpha particles, and so should not be neglected in future\nstudies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2020 18:00:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-02"}

We adopt an isothermal equation of\nstate and concentrate resolution on the protoplanet to investigate flows down\nto the scale of the protoplanet's circumplanetary disk (CPD). We find enhanced\nprograde rotation exterior to the CPD for low planet masses undergoing subsonic\neccentric motion. If the eccentricity is made large enough to develop a bow\nshock, this trend reverses and rotation becomes increasingly retrograde. The\ninstantaneous eccentric flow field is dramatically altered compared to circular\norbits. Whereas the latter exhibit a generic pattern of polar inflow and\nmidplane outflow, the flow geometry depends on orbital phase in the eccentric\ncase. For even the modest eccentricities tested here, the dominant source of\ninflow can come from the midplane instead of the poles.

We compute the exact value of $dem$ for grids, hypercubes,\nand complete bipartite graphs.\n  Then, we relate $dem$ to other standard graph parameters. We show that\n$demG)$ is lower-bounded by the arboricity of the graph, and upper-bounded by\nits vertex cover number. It is also upper-bounded by twice its feedback edge\nset number. Moreover, we characterize connected graphs $G$ with $dem(G)=2$.\n  Then, we show that determining $dem(G)$ for an input graph $G$ is an\nNP-complete problem, even for apex graphs. There exists a polynomial-time\nlogarithmic-factor approximation algorithm, however it is NP-hard to compute an\nasymptotically better approximation, even for bipartite graphs of small\ndiameter and for bipartite subcubic graphs. For such instances, the problem is\nalso unlikey to be fixed parameter tractable when parameterized by the solution\nsize.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2020 18:20:20 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Sep 2022 11:00:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-09-26"}

The simplification from SU(2) to U(1)$^3$ can be performed simply by hand\nwithin the Hamiltonian formulation by dropping all non-Abelian terms from the\nGauss, spatial diffeomorphism and Hamiltonian constraints respectively.\nHowever, one may ask from which Lagrangian formulation this theory descends.\nFor the SU(2) theory it is known that one can choose the Palatini action, Holst\naction or (anti-)selfdual action (Euclidian signature) as starting point all\nleading to equivalent Hamiltonian formulations. In this paper we systematically\nanalyse this question directly for the U(1)$^3$ theory. Surprisingly, it turns\nout that the Abelian analog of the Palatini or Holst formulation is a\nconsistent but topological theory without propagating degrees of freedom. On\nthe other hand, a twisted Abelian analog of the (anti-)selfdual formulation\ndoes lead to the desired Hamiltonian formulation. A new aspect of our\nderivation is that we work with 1. half-density valued tetrads which simplifies\nthe analysis, 2. without the simplicity constraint (which admits one undesired\nsolution that is usually neglected by hand) and 3. without imposing the time\ngauge from the beginning. As a byproduct we show that also the non-Abelian\ntheory admits a twisted (anti-)selfdual formulation. Finally we also derive a\npure connection formulation of Euclidian GR including a cosmological constant\nby extending previous work due to Capovilla, Dell, Jacobson and Peldan which\nmay be an interesting starting point for path integral investigations and\ndisplays (Euclidian) GR as a Yang-Mills theory with non-polynomial Lagrangian.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2020 18:22:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 19 Dec 2021 15:00:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-21"}

The linear perturbations of the uniform self-gravitating gas at\nrest are marginally stable at $\\lambda \\simeq \\lambda_J$, but as soon as the\ndrift of grains is taken into account, they begin growing at a rate\napproximately equal to $(f \\tau)^{1/3} t^{-1}_{ff}$, where $\\tau$ is the\nstopping time of grains expressed in units of the free fall time of the cloud,\n$t_{ff}$.

This paper considers applying\nRSMA in C-RAN. We address the practical challenge of a transmitter that only\nknows the statistical channel state (CSI) information of the users. To this\nend, the paper investigates the problem of stochastic coordinated beamforming\n(SCB) optimization to maximize the ergodic sum-rate (ESR) in the network.\nFurthermore, we propose a scalable and robust RS scheme where the number of the\ncommon streams to be decoded at each user scales linearly with the number of\nusers, and the common stream selection only depends on the statistical CSI.

A\nsample average approximation (SAA) and weighted minimum mean square error\n(WMMSE) based algorithm is adopted to tackle the intractable stochastic\nnon-convex optimization and guarantee convergence to a stationary point\nasymptotically.

First, we propose a novel 2-Dimensional Sharding\nstrategy, which inherently supports cross-shard transactions, alleviating the\nneed for complicated inter-shard communication protocols. Second, we employ\ndistributed storage techniques in the propagation of blocks, improving latency\nunder restricted bandwidth. Finally, we incorporate polynomial cryptographic\nprimitives of low degree, which brings coded blockchain techniques into the\nrealm of feasible real-world parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2020 20:12:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-03"}

The size\ndistribution of the aligned-grain population can be constrained by measurements\nof the wavelength dependence of the polarization. The leading physical model\nfor producing the alignment is radiative alignment-torques (RAT), which\npredicts that the most efficiently aligned grains are those with sizes larger\nthan the wavelengths of light composing the local radiation field. Therefore,\nfor a given grain-size distribution, the wavelength at which the polarization\nreaches a maximum ($\\lambda_\\mathrm{max}$) should correlate with the\ncharacteristic reddening along the line of sight between the dust grains and\nthe illumination source.

This is relevant for light scalar models of dark matter\nwith weak self-interactions that require nonzero temperatures, or that have\nbeen heated inside galaxies. We derived expressions for dynamical friction\nusing linear perturbation theory, and compared these to numerical simulations\nin which nonlinear effects are included. After testing the linear result, it\nwas applied to the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy, and two of its\ngravitationally bound globular clusters. Dwarf spheroidals are well-suited for\nindirectly probing properties of dark matter, and so by estimating the rate at\nwhich these globular clusters are expected to sink into their host halo due to\ndynamical friction, we inferred limits on the superfluid dark matter parameter\nspace. The dynamical friction in a finite-temperature superfluid is found to\nbehave very similarly to the zero-temperature limit, even when the thermal\ncontributions are large. However, when a critical velocity for the superfluid\nflow is included, the friction force can transition from the zero-temperature\nvalue to the value in a conventional fluid. Increasing the mass of the\nperturbing object induces a similar transition to when lowering the critical\nvelocity. When applied to two of Fornax's globular clusters, we find that the\nparameter space preferred in the literature for a zero-temperature superfluid\nyields decay times that are in agreement with observations. However, the\npresent work suggests that increasing the temperature, which is expected to\nchange the preferred parameter space, may lead to very small decay times, and\ntherefore pose a problem for finite-temperature superfluid models of dark\nmatter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2020 21:49:23 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 15 Jan 2021 12:33:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-17"}

Whereas the most investigated\nnodes of HBC have been Electric and Electro-quasistatic (EQS) Capacitive and\nGalvanic, recently Magnetic HBC (M-HBC) has been proposed as a viable\nalternative. Previous works have investigated M-HBC through an application\npoint of view, without developing a fundamental working principle for the same.\nIn this paper, for the first time, a ground up analysis has been performed to\nstudy the possible effects and contributions of the human body channel in M-HBC\nover a broad frequency range (1kHz to 10 GHz), by detailed electromagnetic\nsimulations and supporting experiments. The results show that while M-HBC can\nbe successfully operated as a body area network, the human body itself plays a\nminimal or negligible role in it's functionality. For frequencies less than\nabout 30 MHz, in the domain of operation of Magneto-quasistatic (MQS) HBC, the\nhuman body is transparent to the quasistatic magnetic field. Conversely for\nhigher frequencies, the conductive nature of human tissues end up attenuating\nMagnetic HBC fields due to Eddy currents induced in body tissues, eliminating\nthe possibility of the body to support efficient waveguide modes. With this\nbetter understanding at hand, different modes of operations of MQS HBC have\nbeen outlined for both high impedance capacitive and 50 Ohm termination cases,\nand their performances have been compared with EQS HBC for similar sized\ndevices, over varying distance between TX and RX. The resulting report presents\nthe first fundamental understanding towards M-HBC operation and its contrast\nwith EQS HBC, aiding HBC device designers to make educated design decisions,\ndepending on mode of applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Oct 2020 22:21:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-03"}

Diagonal gates of the Clifford\nhierarchy and 'nearly diagonal' semi-Clifford gates are particularly important:\nthey admit efficient gate teleportation protocols that implement these gates\nwith fewer ancillary quantum resources such as magic states. Despite the\npractical importance of these sets of gates, many questions about their\nstructure remain open; this is especially true in the higher-dimensional qudit\nsetting. Our contribution is to leverage the discrete Stone-von Neumann theorem\nand the symplectic formalism of qudit stabiliser mechanics towards extending\nresults of Zeng-Cheng-Chuang (2008) and Beigi-Shor (2010) to higher dimensions\nin a uniform manner.

In prior work, we showed that the automorphism group of\nclassical $\\mathbb{Z}_4$-linear Kerdock codes maps to a unitary $2$-design,\nwhich established a new classical-quantum connection via graph states. In this\npaper, we construct a Markov process that mixes this Kerdock $2$-design with\nsymplectic transvections, and show that this process produces an\n$\\epsilon$-approximate unitary $3$-design. We construct a graph whose vertices\nare Pauli matrices, and two vertices are connected by directed edges if and\nonly if they commute. A unitary ensemble that is transitive on vertices, edges,\nand non-edges of this Pauli graph is an exact $3$-design, and the stationary\ndistribution of our process possesses this property. With respect to the\nsymmetries of Kerdock codes, the Pauli graph has two types of edges; the\nKerdock $2$-design mixes edges of the same type, and the transvections mix the\ntypes.

First, we model mineral abundances from VIR data, including either\nmeteorite-derived insoluble organic matter, amorphous carbon, magnetite, or\ncombination as the darkening agent and provide statistically rigorous error\nbars from a Bayesian algorithm combined with a radiative-transfer model.\nElemental abundances of C and Fe are much higher than is suggested by the GRaND\nobservations for all models satisfying VIR data. We then show that radiative\ntransfer modeling predicts higher reflectance from a carbonaceous chondrite of\nknown composition than its measured reflectance. Consequently, our second\nmodels use multiple carbonaceous chondrite endmembers, allowing for the\npossibility that their specific textures or minerals other than carbon or\nmagnetite act as darkening agents, including sulfides and tochilinite. Unmixing\nmodels with carbonaceous chondrites eliminate the discrepancy in elemental\nabundances of C and Fe. Ceres' average reflectance spectrum and elemental\nabundances are best reproduced by carbonaceous-chondrite-like materials (40-70\nwt.%), IOM or amorphous carbon (10 wt.%), magnetite (3-8 wt.%), serpentine\n(10-25 wt.%), carbonates (4-12 wt.%), and NH4-bearing phyllosilicates (1-11\nwt.%).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Oct 2020 00:54:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-03"}

This was done by manipulating the temporal onset of sounds\nrelative to the fixation onset of words in the text. If novel sounds cause\nsaccadic inhibition, they should be more distracting when presented during the\nsecond half of fixations when saccade programming usually takes place.\nParticipants read single sentences and heard a 120 ms sound when they fixated\nfive target words in the sentence.

To address this problem, in this paper, we\npropose a multimodal UST system that deeply mines the audio and spatiotemporal\ncontext together.

It\nis known as the electric network frequency (ENF) criterion, enabled by the\nproperties of random fluctuation and intra-grid consistency. In essence, this\nis a task of matching a short random sequence within a long reference, and the\nreliability of this criterion is mainly concerned with whether this match could\nbe unique and correct. In this paper, we comprehensively analyze the factors\naffecting the reliability of ENF matching, including length of test recording,\nlength of reference, temporal resolution, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). For\nsynthetic analysis, we incorporate the first-order autoregressive (AR) ENF\nmodel and propose an efficient time-frequency domain (TFD) noisy ENF synthesis\nmethod. Then, the reliability analysis schemes for both synthetic and\nreal-world data are respectively proposed.

To alleviate this problem, explicitly correlated variants of these\ncorrections, $E^{(20)}_{\\rm disp}$-F12 and $E^{(20)}_{\\rm exch-disp}$-F12, have\nbeen proposed recently.

Instead of\nsearching for better task-aware initialization, we focus on a complementary\nfactor in MAML framework, inner-loop optimization (or fast adaptation).\nConsequently, we propose a new weight update rule that greatly enhances the\nfast adaptation process. Specifically, we introduce a small meta-network that\ncan adaptively generate per-step hyperparameters: learning rate and weight\ndecay coefficients. The experimental results validate that the Adaptive\nLearning of hyperparameters for Fast Adaptation (ALFA) is the equally important\ningredient that was often neglected in the recent few-shot learning approaches.\nSurprisingly, fast adaptation from random initialization with ALFA can already\noutperform MAML.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Oct 2020 08:05:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Dec 2020 06:53:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-09"}

Previous studies have shown that\nthese data are consistent with a scenario in which the CRs are diffused away\nfrom a stationary source at the GC. We previously showed that, taking the 3D\ngas distribution and a realistic distribution of supernova explosions into\naccount, CRs accelerated in supernova remnants (SNR) should account for a large\nfraction of the GC CRs observed by H.E.S.S.; but the model did not fully\nreproduce the apparent over-density in the inner 30 pc.\n  In this work, we study the time-energy dependent cosmic rays escape from the\nremnant that is expected to occur when the shock wave decelerates in the\nsurrounding medium. We show that the resulting CR distribution follows the\nquasi-stationary profile observed by H.E.S.S. more closely. The main signature\nis that the energy-dependent escape creates a strong dependency of the\nmorphology of the gamma-ray emission with the energy.

Quantum confined\nStark effect is one of the routes to dynamically tune the emission line of\nthese excitonic complexes. In this work, using a high quality\ngraphene/hBN/WS$_2$/hBN/Au vertical heterojunction, we demonstrate for the\nfirst time, an out-of-plane electric field driven change in the sign of the\nStark shift from blue to red for four different excitonic species, namely, the\nneutral exciton, the charged exciton (trion), the charged biexciton, and the\ndefect-bound exciton. Such universal non-monotonic Stark shift with electric\nfield arises from a competition between the conventional quantum confined Stark\neffect driven red shift and a suppressed binding energy driven anomalous blue\nshift of the emission lines, with the latter dominating in the low field\nregime. We also find that the encapsulating environment of the monolayer TMDC\nplays an important role in wave function spreading, and hence in determining\nthe magnitude of the blue Stark shift. The results for neutral and charged\nexcitonic species are in excellent agreement with calculations from\nBethe-Salpeter Equation that uses seven-band per spin tight binding\nHamiltonian. The findings have important implications in probing many-body\ninteraction in the two dimension as well as in developing layered semiconductor\nbased tunable optoelectronic devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Oct 2020 09:17:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-24"}

Modeling of the linearized control response of plasma shape\nand position has been widely used for shape controller design in the last\nseveral years. But it usually contains much of the uncertainty, such as\nstructured uncertainties and unmodeled dynamics. EAST tokamak plasma shape\ncontroller design is also based on a linear rigid plasma response model which\nintegrated within a Matlab-based toolset known as TokSys. Meanwhile the PID\ncontrol approach is currently used for EAST plasma shape control. This leads to\nstrong coupling between different parameters describing the plasma shape. To\nhandle these problems, a H_infinity robust control scheme for EAST multi-input\nmulti-output (MIMO) shape control has been proposed. First, the plasma response\nis modeled as the linearized rigid RZIp model. Then, the controller design\ntechnique is introduced with two main stages: 1) loop shaping is used to shape\nthe nominal plant singular values to give desired open-loop properties at\nfrequencies of high and low loop gain; 2) a normalized coprime factorization\nand H_infinity technique is used to decouple the most relevant control channels\nand minimize the tracking errors. Finally, the simulation results show that the\nH_infinity robust controller combines good robust stability margins, speed of\nresponse, dynamic tracking characteristics, and closed-loop decoupling for EAST\nplasma shape control.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Oct 2020 10:56:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-03"}

A numerical experiment is designed to show\nthe benefits using antenna and frequency selections in spatially and frequency\nselective fading channels for single-user and multi-user cases.

Precise TESS data show that the slight,\n0.005-0.01 mag, light variations imposed on this general trend do consist of a\nfew independent wave trains of an apparently time-coherent nature. Assuming\nthat this is typical situation, based on an analysis of colour-magnitude\ndiagrams obtained for earlier epochs, we were able to make a preliminarily\ninference that the bulk of the light changes observed could be due to the\nrotation of disc photosphere inhomogeneities, arising between 10-12 solar radii\nfrom the star.

As a consequence, economic activities within and\nacross the countries were almost halted. As restrictions loosen and cities\nstart to resume public and private transport to revamp the economy, it becomes\ncritical to assess the commuters' travel-related risk in light of the ongoing\npandemic. We develop a generalizable quantitative framework to evaluate the\ncommute-related risk arising from inter-district and intra-district travels by\ncombining Nonparametric Data Envelopment analysis for vulnerability assessment\nwith transportation network analysis. We demonstrate the application of the\nproposed model for establishing travel corridors or travel bubbles within and\nacross Gujarat and Maharashtra, two Indian states that have reported many\nSARS-CoV2 cases since early April 2020. Our findings suggest that establishing\nthe travel bubble between a pair of districts solely based on the health\nvulnerability indices of origin-destination discards the en-route travel risks\ndue to prevalent pandemic, hence underestimating the threat. For example, while\nthe resultant of social and health vulnerabilities of Narmada and Vadodara's\ndistricts is relatively moderate, the en-route travel risk exacerbates the\noverall travel risk.

The focus is on placing computability into\na larger mathematical context, rather than on a complete development of\ncomputability theory. We begin with a treatment of partial functions, using the\nnotion of dominance, which is used in synthetic domain theory to discuss\nclasses of partial maps. We relate this and other ideas from synthetic domain\ntheory to other approaches to partiality in type theory. We show that the\nnotion of dominance is difficult to apply in our setting: the set of\n$\\Sigma_0^1$ propositions investigated by Rosolini form a dominance precisely\nif a weak, but nevertheless unprovable, choice principle holds. To get around\nthis problem, we suggest an alternative notion of partial function we call\ndisciplined maps. In the presence of countable choice, this notion coincides\nwith Rosolini's.\n  Using a general notion of partial function, we take the first steps in\nconstructive computability theory. We do this both with computability as\nstructure, where we have direct access to programs; and with computability as\nproperty, where we must work in a program-invariant way. We demonstrate the\ndifference between these two approaches by showing how these approaches relate\nto facts about computability theory arising from topos-theoretic and\ntype-theoretic concerns. Finally, we tie the two threads together: assuming\ncountable choice and that all total functions $\\mathbb{N}\\to\\mathbb{N}$ are\ncomputable (both of which hold in the effective topos), the Rosolini partial\nfunctions, the disciplined maps, and the computable partial functions all\ncoincide.

In many active biological systems\nchirality plays an important role. Biomolecules such as DNA, actin, or\nmicrotubules form helical structures which, at sufficiently high density and in\nthe absence of active forces, tend to self-assemble into twisted cholesteric\nphases. Understanding the outcome of the interplay between chirality and\nactivity is therefore an important and timely question.

Commonly, neuronal excitability is divided\ninto two classes: Type I and Type II, both having different properties that\naffect information processing, such as thresholding and gain scaling. These\nproperties can be mathematically studied using generalised phenomenological\nmodels, such as the Fitzhugh-Nagumo model and the mirrored FHN. The FHN model\nshows that each excitability type corresponds to one specific type of\nbifurcation in the phase plane: Type I underlies a saddle-node on invariant\ncycle bifurcation, and Type II a Hopf bifurcation. The difficulty of modelling\nType I excitability is that it is not only represented by its underlying\nbifurcation, but also should be able to generate frequency while maintaining a\nsmall depolarising current. Using the mFHN model, we show that this situation\nis possible without modifying the phase portrait, due to the incorporation of a\nslow regenerative variable. We show that in the singular limit of the mFHN\nmodel, the time-scale separation can be chosen such that there is a\nconfiguration of a classical phase portrait that allows for SNIC bifurcation,\nzero-frequency onset and a depolarising current, such as observed in Type I\nexcitability. Using the definition of slow conductance, g_s, we show that these\nmathematical findings for excitability change are translatable to reduced\nconductance based models and also relates to an experimentally measurable\nquantity. This not only allows for a measure of excitability change, but also\nrelates the mathematical parameters that indicate a physiological Type I\nexcitability to parameters that can be tuned during experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 31 Oct 2020 15:58:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-03"}
