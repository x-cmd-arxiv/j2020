The variation in the velocity of light\ncreates an effect akin to the refraction phenomenon which occurs for a wave\ntraveling in a medium with varying speed of wave. We elucidate the role of the\nlocal scale of gravitationally-bound regions in assisting the refraction effect\nto manifest. The refraction effect alters the redshift formulae (Lemaitre,\ndistance-vs-z, luminosity distance-vs-z) and warrants a new analysis of the\nPantheon dataset. Upon a reformulation of the distance-redshift relations, we\nachieve a high-quality fit of the Pantheon dataset to the variable light speed\napproach; the fit is as robust as that obtained in the standard $\\Lambda CDM$\nmodel. We find that the Pantheon dataset is consistent with the variable light\nspeed of the functional form: $a\\propto t^{\\mu}$ and $c\\propto a^{1-1/\\mu}$\nwith (i) the cosmic age $t_{0}\\approx 13.9$ Gy as a free parameter, while $\\mu$\nis unspecified; and (ii) a monotonic variation in the local scale for\ngravitationally-bound objects (applicable to the emission sources and the Solar\nSystem-based apparatus/observer). Due to the agent in (ii), the high-z portion\nof the Pantheon dataset would produce an \"effective\" $H_{0}$ estimate which is\n10 percent lower than the $H_{0}$ estimate obtained from the low-z portion of\nthe dataset. We offer an alternative interpretation of the accelerating\nexpansion by way of variable speed of light, and as a by-product of the agent\nuncovered in (ii), a tentative suggestion toward \"resolving\" the ongoing\ntension in the Hubble constant estimates.\n  [1] J.D.

In this\npaper, we propose a hierarchical driving model with explicit model of\ncontinuous intention and continuous dynamics, which decouples the complexity in\nthe observation-to-action reasoning in the human driving data. Specifically,\nthe continuous intention module takes the route planning map obtained by GPS\nand IMU, perception from a RGB camera and LiDAR as input to generate a\npotential map encoded with obstacles and intentions being expressed as grid\nbased potentials. Then, the potential map is regarded as a condition, together\nwith the current dynamics, to generate a continuous trajectory as output by a\ncontinuous function approximator network, whose derivatives can be used for\nsupervision without additional parameters. Finally, we validate our method on\nboth datasets and simulator, demonstrating that our method has higher\nprediction accuracy of displacement and velocity and generates smoother\ntrajectories. The method is also deployed on the real vehicle with loop\nlatency, validating its effectiveness.

We present a\nsolution to this problem that is based on a novel combined high-accuracy\nranging and frequency transfer technique. Using this approach, we present the\ndesign of the first fully wireless distributed system operating at the\nwavelength level. We demonstrate the system in the first open-loop coherent\ndistributed beamforming experiment. Internode range estimation to support phase\nalignment was performed using a two-tone stepped frequency waveform with a\nsingle pulse, while a two-tone waveform was used for frequency synchronization,\nwhere the oscillator of a secondary node was disciplined to the primary node.\nIn this concept, secondary nodes are equipped with an adjunct self-mixing\ncircuit that is able to extract the reference frequency from the captured\nsynchronization waveform. The approach was implemented on a two-node dynamic\nsystem using Ettus X310 software-defined radios, with coherent beamforming at\n1.5 GHz.

In the past, they were postulated using a generalization of the symmetry\nproperties of the Riemann tensor (curl on each index of a totally symmetric\nrank-$n$ field for each spin-$n$). For this reason they are sometimes referred\nto as the generalized 'Riemann' tensors. In this article, a method for deriving\nthese curvature tensors from first principles is presented; the derivation is\ncompleted without any a priori knowledge of the existence of the Riemann\ntensors or the curvature tensors of higher-spin gauge theories. To perform this\nderivation, a recently developed procedure for deriving exactly gauge invariant\nLagrangian densities from quadratic combinations of $N$ order of derivatives\nand $M$ rank of tensor potential is applied to the $N = M = n$ case under the\nspin-$n$ gauge transformations. This procedure uniquely yields the Lagrangian\nfor classical electrodynamics in the $N = M = 1$ case and the Lagrangian for\nhigher derivative gravity (`Riemann' and `Ricci' squared terms) in the $N = M =\n2$ case. It is proven here by direct calculation for the $N = M = 3$ case that\nthe unique solution to this procedure is the spin-3 curvature tensor and its\ncontractions. The spin-4 curvature tensor is also uniquely derived for the $N =\nM = 4$ case. In other words, it is proven here that, for the most general\nlinear combination of scalars built from $N$ derivatives and $M$ rank of tensor\npotential, up to $N=M=4$, there exists a unique solution to the resulting\nsystem of linear equations as the contracted spin-$n$ curvature tensors.\nConjectures regarding the solutions to the higher spin-$n$ $N = M = n$ are\ndiscussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 16:30:13 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 14:29:41 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 19 Nov 2020 17:21:27 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2020 15:27:07 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Sun, 13 Dec 2020 16:01:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-15"}

After successful\ncompletion of the Critical Design Review and Ambient Test Readiness Review\nphases of the project, the EQM of EIRSAT-1 will be assembled and integrated.\nAfter assembly and integration of the EQM, the project will begin the ambient\ntest campaign, in which the EQM undergoes ambient functional and mission\ntesting. This work details the preparation and execution of the assembly,\nintegration, and verification activities of EIRSAT-1 EQM.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 16:36:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-21"}

We attempt to derive and clarify\nthese rules using standard techniques of QFT. We begin with a careful\nexamination of the timelike linear dilaton. Although the background charge $Q$\nbreaks the scalar field's continuous shift symmetry, the exponential of the\naction is invariant under a discrete shift because $Q$ is imaginary. Gauging\nthis symmetry makes the dilaton compact and introduces winding modes into the\nspectrum. One of these winding operators corresponds to the BRST current first\nintroduced by Felder. The cohomology of this BRST charge isolates the\nirreducible representations of the Virasoro algebra within the linear dilaton\nFock space, and the supertrace in the BRST complex reproduces the minimal model\npartition function. The model at the radius $R=\\sqrt{pp'}$ has two marginal\noperators corresponding to the Dotsenko-Fateev screening charges. Deforming by\nthem, we obtain a model that might be called a \"BRST quotiented compact\ntimelike Liouville theory.\" The Hamiltonian of the zero-mode quantum mechanics\nis not Hermitian, but it is $PT$-symmetric and exactly solvable. Its\neigenfunctions have support on an infinite number of plane waves, suggesting an\ninfinite reduction in the number of independent states in the full QFT.\nApplying conformal perturbation theory to the exponential interactions\nreproduces the Coulomb gas calculations of minimal model correlators. In\ncontrast to spacelike Liouville, these resonance correlators are finite because\nthe zero mode is compact. We comment on subtleties regarding the reflection\noperator identification, as well as naive violations of truncation in\ncorrelators with multiple reflection operators inserted.

For this\npurpose, we introduce a new implementation of eFAM that accounts for selection\neffects, survey footprint, and galaxy bias. We use the reconstructed BAO peak\nto measure the angular diameter distance, D_A(z)r^{fid}_s/r_s, and the Hubble\nparameter, H(z)r_s/r^{fid}_s, normalized to the sound horizon scale for a\nfiducial cosmology r^{fid}_s, at the mean redshift of the sample z=0.38,\nobtaining D_A(z=0.38)r^{fid}_s/r_s=1090 +/- 29 (Mpc)^{-1}, and\nH(z=0.38)r_s}/r^{fid}_s=83 +/- 3 (km s^{-1}Mpc^{-1}), in agreement with\nprevious measurements on the same dataset. The validation tests, performed\nusing 400 publicly available SDSS-DR12 mock catalogues, reveal that eFAM\nperforms well in reconstructing the 2PCF down to separations of 25h^{-1}Mpc$,\ni.e. well into the non-linear regime.

Of particular interest are antiferromagnets, which due to their\nintrinsic antiferromagnetic exchange coupling show several advantages in\nrelation to ferromagnets such as robustness against external magnetic\nperturbations. This property is one of the cornerstones of antiferromagnets and\nimplies that information stored in antiferromagnetic domains is invisible to\napplied magnetic fields preventing it from being erased or manipulated. Here we\nshow that, despite this fundamental understanding, the magnetic domains of\nrecently discovered vdW MnPS3 antiferromagnet can be controlled via external\nmagnetic fields and currents. We realize ultrafast domain-wall dynamics with\nvelocities up to 1500 m/s and 3000 m/s respectively to a broad range of fields\nand current densities. Both domain wall dynamics are determined by the edge\nterminations which generated uncompensated spins following the underlying\nsymmetry of the honeycomb structure. We find that edge atoms belonging to\ndifferent magnetic sublattices function as geometrical constrictions preventing\nthe displacement of the wall, whereas having atoms of the same sublattice at\nboth edges of the material allows for the field-driven domain wall motion which\nis only limited by the spin-flop transition of the antiferromagnet beyond 25 T.\nConversely, electric currents can induce motion of domain walls in most of the\nedges except those where the two sublattices are present at the borders (e.g.\narmchair edges). Our results indicate that the implementation of 2D vdW\nantiferromagnets in real applications requires the engineering of the layer\nedges which enables an unprecedented functional feature in ultrathin device\nplatforms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 17:26:48 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2020 10:22:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-04"}

For decades, lexical matching signal has dominated the ad-hoc\nretrieval process, but it also has inherent defects, such as the vocabulary\nmismatch problem. Recently, Dense Retrieval (DR) technique has been proposed to\nalleviate these limitations by capturing the deep semantic relationship between\nqueries and documents. The training of most existing Dense Retrieval models\nrelies on sampling negative instances from the corpus to optimize a pairwise\nloss function. Through investigation, we find that this kind of training\nstrategy is biased and fails to optimize full retrieval performance effectively\nand efficiently. To solve this problem, we propose a Learning To Retrieve\n(LTRe) training technique. LTRe constructs the document index beforehand. At\neach training iteration, it performs full retrieval without negative sampling\nand then updates the query representation model parameters. Through this\nprocess, it teaches the DR model how to retrieve relevant documents from the\nentire corpus instead of how to rerank a potentially biased sample of\ndocuments. Experiments in both passage retrieval and document retrieval tasks\nshow that: 1) in terms of effectiveness, LTRe significantly outperforms all\ncompetitive sparse and dense baselines. It even gains better performance than\nthe BM25-BERT cascade system under reasonable latency constraints. 2) in terms\nof training efficiency, compared with the previous state-of-the-art DR method,\nLTRe provides more than 170x speed-up in the training process. Training with a\ncompressed index further saves computing resources with minor performance loss.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 17:29:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-21"}

Unlike Thomson scattering, Rayleigh scattering is\nfrequency dependent resulting in the generation of anisotropies with a\ndifferent spectral dependence. Unfortunately the Rayleigh scattering efficiency\nrapidly decreases with the expansion of the neutral universe, with the result\nthat only a small percentage of photons are scattered by neutral hydrogen.\nAlthough the effect is very small, future CMB missions with higher sensitivity\nand improved frequency coverage are poised to measure Rayleigh scattering\nsignal.

Moreover, we show that this\ncorrection due to the input energy is nonzero only when Coulomb-interactions\nare present. Thus, fluctuation response relations offer an until now unrevealed\nopportunity to probe many-body correlations in quantum systems. We demonstrate\nour general findings at the concrete example of a single-level quantum dot\nmodel, and propose a scheme to measure the interaction-induced discrepancies\nfrom the stationary case.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 17:39:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}

Often the method of choice for investigating nonperturbative effects\nhas been the lattice formulation, and in the case of gravity the Regge-Wheeler\nlattice path integral lends itself well for that purpose. Nevertheless, lattice\nmethods ultimately rely on extensive numerical calculations, leaving a desire\nfor alternate calculations that can be done analytically. In this work we\noutline the Hartree-Fock approximation to quantum gravity, along lines which\nare analogous to what is done for scalar fields and gauge theories. The\nstarting point is Dyson's equations, a closed set of integral equations which\nrelate various physical amplitudes involving graviton propagators, vertex\nfunctions and proper self-energies. Such equations are in general difficult to\nsolve, and as a result not very useful in practice, but nevertheless provide a\nbasis for subsequent approximations. This is where the Hartree-Fock\napproximation comes in, whereby lowest order diagrams get partially dressed by\nthe use of fully interacting Green's function and self-energies, which then\nlead to a set of self-consistent integral equations. Specifically, for quantum\ngravity one finds a nontrivial ultraviolet fixed point in Newton's constant G\nfor spacetime dimensions greater than two, and nontrivial scaling dimensions\nbetween d=2 and d=4, above which one obtains Gaussian exponents. In addition,\nthe Hartree-Fock approximation gives an explicit analytic expression for the\nrenormalization group running of Newton's constant, suggesting gravitational\nantiscreening with Newton's G slowly increasing on cosmological scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 17:54:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Nov 2020 21:06:56 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 8 Jan 2021 19:01:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-12"}

This aims at building correct-by-construction\nquantum circuits to be deployed on quantum devices such as those available at\nthe IBM Q Experience. Quantum circuit reversibility is ensured by minimal\ncomplements, extended recursively. Measurements are postponed to the end of\nsuch recursive computations, termed \"quantamorphisms\", thus maximising the\nquantum effect. Quantamorphisms are classical catamorphisms which, extended to\nensure quantum reversibility, implement quantum cycles (vulg. for-loops) and\nquantum folds on lists. By Kleisli correspondence, quantamorphisms can be\nwritten as monadic functional programs with quantum parameters.

Such calculated quantum programs prepared in Haskell are\npushed through Quipper to the Qiskit interface to IBM Q quantum devices. The\ngenerated quantum circuits - often quite large - exhibit the predicted\nbehaviour. However, running them on real quantum devices incurs into a\nsignificant amount of errors.

It is challenging to quantify how the architecture of planetary\nsystems is affected by these environmental processes, because stellar groups\nspatially disperse within <1 billion years, well below the ages of most known\nexoplanets. Here we identify old, co-moving stellar groups around exoplanet\nhost stars in the astrometric data from the Gaia satellite and demonstrate that\nthe architecture of planetary systems exhibits a strong dependence on local\nstellar clustering in position-velocity phase space, implying a dependence on\ntheir formation or evolution environment.

The significant flux increase throughout\nthe infrared presents a challenging atmosphere to model with existing grids.\nBest-fit values vary from 1200 K to 1800 K for effective temperature and from\n3.0 to 5.0 for log($g$), depending on which individual wavelength band is fit\nand which model suite is applied.

But, in the case of machine learning with neural\nnetworks, it is generally assumed that strict feed-forward architectures are\nsuitable for static input data, such as images, whereas recurrent networks are\nrequired mainly for the processing of sequential input, such as language.\nHowever, it is not clear whether also processing of static input data benefits\nfrom recurrent connectivity. In this work, we introduce and test a novel\nimplementation of recurrent neural networks with lateral and feed-back\nconnections into deep learning. This departure from the strict feed-forward\nstructure prevents the use of the standard error backpropagation algorithm for\ntraining the networks. Therefore we provide an algorithm which implements the\nbackpropagation algorithm on a implicit implementation of recurrent networks,\nwhich is different from state-of-the-art implementations of recurrent neural\nnetworks. Our method, in contrast to current recurrent neural networks,\neliminates the use of long chains of derivatives due to many iterative update\nsteps, which makes learning computationally less costly. It turns out that the\npresence of recurrent intra-layer connections within a one-layer implicit\nrecurrent network enhances the performance of neural networks considerably: A\nsingle-layer implicit recurrent network is able to solve the XOR problem, while\na feed-forward network with monotonically increasing activation function fails\nat this task.

For example, stakeholders might ask which treatment is\nmost likely to improve mean survival by at least 2 years or which treatment is\nassociated with the longest mean survival. The answers to these two questions\nare not necessarily the same. We discuss the most commonly used ranking metrics\n(quantities that describe or compare the estimated treatment-specific effects),\nhow the metrics produce a treatment hierarchy and the type of treatment\nhierarchy question that each metric can answer. We show that the ranking\nmetrics encompass the uncertainty in the estimation of the treatment effects in\ndifferent ways, which results in different treatment hierarchies. Conclusions:\nNetwork meta-analyses that aim to rank treatments should state in the protocol\nthe treatment hierarchy question they aim to address and employ the appropriate\nranking metric to answer it.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 19:57:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-22"}

An\nundirected utterance is termed as a \"false trigger\" and false trigger\nmitigation (FTM) is essential for designing a privacy-centric non-intrusive\nsmart assistant. The directedness of an utterance can be identified by running\nautomatic speech recognition (ASR) on it and determining the user intent by\nanalyzing the ASR transcript. But in case of a false trigger, transcribing the\naudio using ASR itself is strongly undesirable. To alleviate this issue, we\npropose an LSTM-based FTM architecture which determines the user intent from\nacoustic features directly without explicitly generating ASR transcripts from\nthe audio. The proposed models are small footprint and can be run on-device\nwith limited computational resources. During training, the model parameters are\noptimized using a knowledge transfer approach where a more accurate\nself-attention graph neural network model serves as the teacher.

However, in these\nscenarios, planetesimals form in general only at some specific locations in\nprotoplanetary discs. On the other hand, it is generally assumed in planet\nformation models and population synthesis models, that planetesimals are\nbroadly distributed in the protoplanetary disc. Here we propose a new scenario\nin which planetesimals can form in broad areas of the discs. Planetesimals form\nat the gas pressure bump formed by a first-generation planet (e.g. formed by\npebble accretion) and the formation region spreads inward in the disc as the\nplanet migrates. We use a simple 1D Lagrangian particle model to calculate the\nradial distribution of pebbles in the gas disc perturbed by a migrating\nembedded planet. We consider that planetesimals form by streaming instability\nat the points where the pebble-to-gas density ratio on the mid-plane becomes\nlarger than unity. We also study the effect of some key parameters like the\nones of the gas disc model, the pebble mass flux, the migration speed of the\nplanet, and the strength of turbulence. We find that planetesimals form in wide\nareas of the discs provided the flux of pebbles is typical and the turbulence\nis not too strong. The planetesimal surface density depends on the pebble mass\nflux and the migration speed of the planet. The total mass of the planetesimals\nand the orbital position of the formation area depend strongly on the pebble\nmass flux. We also find that the profile of the planetesimal surface density\nand its slope can be estimated by very simple equations. We show that our new\nscenario can explain the formation of planetesimals in broad areas. The simple\nestimates we provide for the planetesimal surface density profile can be used\nas initial conditions for population synthesis models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 20:05:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-04"}

It occurs when the external\nmagnetic field decreases sufficiently fast such that its decay index,\n$n=-z\\,\\partial\\,(\\ln B)/\\partial z$ is larger than a critical value, $n>n_{\\rm\ncr}$, where $n_{\\rm cr}=1.5$ for a full, large aspect ratio torus. However,\nwhen this is applied to solar MFRs, a range of conflicting values for $n_{\\rm\ncr}$ is found in the literature. To investigate this discrepancy, we have\nconducted laboratory experiments on arched, line-tied flux ropes and have\napplied a theoretical model of the torus instability. Our model describes an\nMFR as a partial torus with footpoints anchored in a conducting surface and\nnumerically calculates various magnetic forces on it. This calculation yields a\nbetter prediction of $n_{\\rm cr}$ which takes into account the specific\nparameters of the MFR. We describe a systematic methodology to properly\ntranslate laboratory results to their solar counterparts, provided that the\nMFRs have sufficiently small edge safety factor, or equivalently, large enough\ntwist.

Precisely, we first extract 3D patches from each modality to\ncalibrate slices through the squeeze and excitation (SE) block.

Finally, the calibrated 2D slices are\nconcatenated to obtain multimodal features through a 2D convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN) for prediction of the central pixel. In our architecture, both\nlocal inter-slice and global intra-slice features are jointly exploited to\npredict class label of the central voxel in a given patch through the 2D CNN\nclassifier.

This paper considers the problem of private weighted sum aggregation with\nsecret weights, where an aggregator wants to compute the weighted sum of the\nlocal data of some agents. Depending on the privacy requirements posed on the\nweights, there are different secure multi-party computation schemes exploiting\nthe information structure. First, when each agent has a local private value and\na local private weight, we review private sum aggregation schemes. Second, we\ndiscuss how to extend the previous schemes for when the agents have a local\nprivate value, but the aggregator holds the corresponding weights. Third, we\ntreat a more general case where the agents have their local private values, but\nthe weights are known neither by the agents nor by the aggregator; they are\ngenerated by a system operator, who wants to keep them private. We give a\nsolution where aggregator obliviousness is achieved, even under collusion\nbetween the participants, and we show how to obtain a more efficient\ncommunication and computation strategy for multi-dimensional data, by batching\nthe data into fewer ciphertexts. Finally, we implement our schemes and discuss\nthe numerical results and efficiency improvements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 21:50:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-22"}

The scheme\nimplements a centred, low dissipation approach for dealing with the advective\npart of the system which profits from small CFL values. Numerical tests\ndemonstrate that the present scheme can solve, efficiently, hyperbolic balance\nlaws in both conservative and non-conservative form as well. An empirical\nconvergence rate assessment shows that the expected theoretical orders of\naccuracy are achieved up to the fifth order.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 22:51:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-28"}

Such an estimator is computed as the minimiser of a smoothness\nfunctional (e.g., TV norm) over the class of all estimators such that none of\nits coefficients with respect to a given multiscale dictionary is statistically\nsignificant. The so obtained multiscale Nemirowski-Dantzig estimator (MIND) can\nincorporate any convex smoothness functional and combine it with a proper\ndictionary including wavelets, curvelets and shearlets. The computation of MIND\nin general requires to solve a high-dimensional constrained convex optimisation\nproblem with a specific structure of the constraints induced by the statistical\nmultiscale testing criterion. To solve this explicitly, we discuss three\ndifferent algorithmic approaches: the Chambolle-Pock, ADMM and semismooth\nNewton algorithms. Algorithmic details and an explicit implementation is\npresented and the solutions are then compared numerically in a simulation study\nand on various test images.

However, it is less studied\nand remains an unsolved problem in how the SOC affects the lattice dynamics.\nWe, therefore, measured the phonon spectra of 5d pyrochlore Cd2Os2O7 over the\nfull Brillouin zone to address the question by using inelastic x-ray scattering\n(IXS). Our main finding is a visible mode-dependence in the phonon spectra,\nmeasured across the metal-insulator transition at 227 K. We examined the SOC\nstrength dependence of the lattice dynamics and its spin-phonon (SP) coupling,\nwith first-principle calculations. Our experimental data taken at 100 K are in\ngood agreement with the theoretical results obtained with the optimized U = 2.0\neV with SOC. By scaling the SOC strength and the U value in the DFT\ncalculations, we demonstrate that SOC is more relevant than U to explaining the\nobserved mode-dependent phonon energy shifts with temperature. Furthermore, the\ntemperature dependence of the phonon energy can be effectively described by\nscaling SOC.

Efficient global optimization\n(EGO) is one of the most popular SAD methods for expensive black-box\noptimization problems. A well-recognized weakness of the original EGO in\ncomplex computer experiments is that it is serial, and hence the modern\nparallel computing techniques cannot be utilized to speed up the running of\nsimulator experiments. For those multiple points EGO methods, the heavy\ncomputation and points clustering are the obstacles. In this work, a novel\nbatch SAD method, named \"accelerated EGO\", is forwarded by using a refined\nsampling/importance resampling (SIR) method to search the points with large\nexpected improvement (EI) values. The computation burden of the new method is\nmuch lighter, and the points clustering is also avoided. The efficiency of the\nproposed SAD is validated by nine classic test functions with dimension from 2\nto 12. The empirical results show that the proposed algorithm indeed can\nparallelize original EGO, and gain much improvement compared against the other\nparallel EGO algorithm especially under high-dimensional case.

However, for disease diagnosis, the widely used\nknowledge graph is hard to represent the symptom-symptom relations and\nsymptom-disease relations since the edges of traditional knowledge graph are\nunweighted. Most research on disease diagnosis dialogue systems highly rely on\ndata-driven methods and statistical features, lacking profound comprehension of\nsymptom-disease relations and symptom-symptom relations. To tackle this issue,\nthis work presents a weighted heterogeneous graph based dialogue system for\ndisease diagnosis. Specifically, we build a weighted heterogeneous graph based\non symptom co-occurrence and a proposed symptom frequency-inverse disease\nfrequency. Then this work proposes a graph based deep Q-network (Graph-DQN) for\ndialogue management. By combining Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) with DQN to\nlearn the embeddings of diseases and symptoms from both the structural and\nattribute information in the weighted heterogeneous graph, Graph-DQN could\ncapture the symptom-disease relations and symptom-symptom relations better.\nExperimental results show that the proposed dialogue system rivals the\nstate-of-the-art models.

Previous unsupervised methods failed to take full\nadvantage of geometry properties in occlusion handling. In this paper, we\nintroduce an effective way to detect occlusion regions and propose a novel\nunsupervised training strategy to deal with occlusion that only uses the\npredicted left disparity map, by making use of its geometry features in an\niterative way. In the training process, we regard the predicted left disparity\nmap as pseudo groundtruth and infer occluded regions using geometry features.\nThe resulting occlusion mask is then used in either training, post-processing,\nor both of them as guidance.

Acting as a\ncontrol group, knockoff feature is generated to mimic the feature map produced\nby the network filter, but they are conditionally independent of the example\nlabel given the real feature map. We theoretically suggest that the knockoff\ncondition can be approximately preserved given the information propagation of\nnetwork layers. Besides the real feature map on an intermediate layer, the\ncorresponding knockoff feature is brought in as another auxiliary input signal\nfor the subsequent layers. Redundant filters can be discovered in the\nadversarial process of different features. Through experiments, we demonstrate\nthe superiority of the proposed algorithm over state-of-the-art methods. For\nexample, our method can reduce 57.8% parameters and 60.2% FLOPs of ResNet-101\nwith only 0.01% top-1 accuracy loss on ImageNet.

It is first shown that\nseveral structural properties of solutions of the FSS can be inferred from the\nsolutions of the KLS. The problems of computation of structural parameters of\nsolutions of non-linear FSS are computationally hard and hence become\ninfeasible as the number of variables increases. In contrast, it has been well\nknown that these problems can be solved by linear algebra for linear FSS in\nterms of elementary divisors of matrices and their orders.

AutoML tools aim to make machine learning accessible for non-machine\nlearning experts (domain experts), to improve the efficiency of machine\nlearning, and to accelerate machine learning research. But although automation\nand efficiency are among AutoML's main selling points, the process still\nrequires human involvement at a number of vital steps, including understanding\nthe attributes of domain-specific data, defining prediction problems, creating\na suitable training data set, and selecting a promising machine learning\ntechnique. These steps often require a prolonged back-and-forth that makes this\nprocess inefficient for domain experts and data scientists alike, and keeps\nso-called AutoML systems from being truly automatic. In this review article, we\nintroduce a new classification system for AutoML systems, using a seven-tiered\nschematic to distinguish these systems based on their level of autonomy.

The idea is\nto supplement the classical supervised task of recommendation with an auxiliary\nself-supervised task, which reinforces node representation learning via\nself-discrimination. Specifically, we generate multiple views of a node,\nmaximizing the agreement between different views of the same node compared to\nthat of other nodes. We devise three operators to generate the views -- node\ndropout, edge dropout, and random walk -- that change the graph structure in\ndifferent manners. We term this new learning paradigm as\n\\textit{Self-supervised Graph Learning} (SGL), implementing it on the\nstate-of-the-art model LightGCN. Through theoretical analyses, we find that SGL\nhas the ability of automatically mining hard negatives. Empirical studies on\nthree benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of SGL, which improves\nthe recommendation accuracy, especially on long-tail items, and the robustness\nagainst interaction noises. Our implementations are available at\n\\url{https://github.com/wujcan/SGL}.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 2020 06:35:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 29 Apr 2021 06:58:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 18 May 2021 02:15:00 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 18 Jun 2021 11:56:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-21"}

However, this method fails to efficiently handle high-cardinality\nfeatures and unseen feature values (e.g. new video ID) that are prevalent in\nreal-world recommendation systems. In this paper, we propose an alternative\nembedding framework Deep Hash Embedding (DHE), replacing embedding tables by a\ndeep embedding network to compute embeddings on the fly. DHE first encodes the\nfeature value to a unique identifier vector with multiple hashing functions and\ntransformations, and then applies a DNN to convert the identifier vector to an\nembedding. The encoding module is deterministic, non-learnable, and free of\nstorage, while the embedding network is updated during the training time to\nlearn embedding generation.

This is suboptimal\nbecause the classifier is inherently biased towards a subset of the modalities.\nTo alleviate this shortcoming, we propose a novel regularization term based on\nthe functional entropy. Intuitively, this term encourages to balance the\ncontribution of each modality to the classification result. However,\nregularization with the functional entropy is challenging. To address this, we\ndevelop a method based on the log-Sobolev inequality, which bounds the\nfunctional entropy with the functional-Fisher-information. Intuitively, this\nmaximizes the amount of information that the modalities contribute. On the two\nchallenging multi-modal datasets VQA-CPv2 and SocialIQ, we obtain\nstate-of-the-art results while more uniformly exploiting the modalities.

However, many previous researchers have relied on\nthe single-orbit Lifshiftz-Kosevich formula, which overlooks the significant\neffect of degenerate orbits on MQOs. Since the single-orbit LK formula is valid\nfor massless Dirac semimetals with small cyclotron masses, it is imperative to\ngeneralize the method applicable to a wide range of Dirac semimetals, whether\nmassless or massive. This report demonstrates how spin-degenerate orbits affect\nthe phases in MQOs of three-dimensional massive Dirac semimetal, NbSb$_2$. With\nvarying the direction of the magnetic field, an abrupt $\\pi$ phase shift is\nobserved due to the interference between the spin-degenerate orbits.

Two formulations of recursive types exist:\niso-recursive and equi-recursive. The relative advantages of iso- and\nequi-recursion are well-studied when it comes to their impact on\ntype-inference. However, the relative semantic expressiveness of the two\nformulations remains unclear so far. This paper studies the semantic\nexpressiveness of STLC with iso- and equi-recursive types, proving that these\nformulations are equally expressive. In fact, we prove that they are both as\nexpressive as STLC with only term-level recursion. We phrase these\nequi-expressiveness results in terms of full abstraction of three canonical\ncompilers between these three languages (STLC with iso-, with equi-recursive\ntypes and with term-level recursion). Our choice of languages allows us to\nstudy expressiveness when interacting over both a simply-typed and a\nrecursively-typed interface. The three proofs all rely on a typed version of a\nproof technique called approximate backtranslation. Together, our results show\nthat there is no difference in semantic expressiveness between STLCs with iso-\nand equi-recursive types.

Since the scalar mass is radiatively unstable, a special explanation\nis required to make the mass much smaller than the UV scale. There are two\nwell-known mechanisms for the origin of scalar mass. The scalar can be\nidentified as a pseudo-Goldstone boson, whose shift symmetry is explicitly\nbroken by non-perturbative corrections, like the axion. Alternatively, it can\nbe identified as a composite particle like the glueball, whose mass is limited\nby the confinement scale of the theory. In both cases, the scalar can be\nnaturally light, but interaction behavior is quite different. The lighter the\naxion (glueball), the weaker (stronger) it interacts. We consider the dark\naxion whose shift symmetry is anomalously broken by the hidden non-abelian\ngauge symmetry. After the confinement of the gauge group, the dark axion and\nthe dark glueball get masses and both form multicomponent dark matter. We\ncarefully consider the effects of energy flow from the dark gluons to the dark\naxions and derive the full equations of motion for the background and the\nperturbed variables. The effect of the dark axion-dark gluon coupling on the\nevolution of the entropy and the isocurvature perturbations is also clarified.\nFinally, we discuss the gravo-thermal collapse of the glueball subcomponent\ndark matter after the halos form, in order to explore the potential to\ncontribute to the formation of seeds for the supermassive black holes observed\nat high redshifts.

Maximum agency is afforded by local anonymization,\nthat allows each individual to anonymize her own data before handing them to\nthe data controller. Randomized response (RR) is a local anonymization approach\nable to yield multi-dimensional full sets of anonymized microdata that are\nvalid for exploratory analysis and machine learning. This is so because an\nunbiased estimate of the distribution of the true data of individuals can be\nobtained from their pooled randomized data. Furthermore, RR offers rigorous\nprivacy guarantees. The main weakness of RR is the curse of dimensionality when\napplied to several attributes: as the number of attributes grows, the accuracy\nof the estimated true data distribution quickly degrades. We propose several\ncomplementary approaches to mitigate the dimensionality problem. First, we\npresent two basic protocols, separate RR on each attribute and joint RR for all\nattributes, and discuss their limitations.

In this paper we study the class of linear functions\nunder uniform constraint and investigate the expected optimisation time of\nRandomised Local Search (RLS) and a simple evolutionary algorithm called (1+1)\nEA.

To alleviate the above relation confusion problem, we propose CTEG,\na model equipped with two mechanisms to learn to decouple these easily-confused\nrelations. On the one hand, an Entity-Guided Attention (EGA) mechanism, which\nleverages the syntactic relations and relative positions between each word and\nthe specified entity pair, is introduced to guide the attention to filter out\ninformation causing confusion.

In the\npresent paper, we introduce a linear-time fixpoint logic Bar-muTL for finite\nwords over an infinite alphabet, which features full negation and freeze\nquantification via name binding. We show by a nontrivial reduction to extended\nregular nondeterministic nominal automata that even though Bar-muTL allows\nunrestricted nondeterminism and unboundedly many registers, model checking\nBar-muTL over RNNAs and satisfiability checking both have elementary\ncomplexity. For example, model checking is in 2ExpSpace, more precisely in\nparametrized ExpSpace, effectively with the number of registers as the\nparameter.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 2020 11:48:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 11 Nov 2020 12:51:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 13 Feb 2021 18:24:17 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 20 Aug 2021 08:07:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-23"}

(2007) and obtain good spectral matches with Sq- or S-type\nasteroids, the lunar surface and of Martian and lunar meteorites. Mixture\nfitting to spectral endmembers suggests a surface abundance of Mg-rich\northopyroxene and iron metal or, alternatively, a mixture of plagioclase and\nmetal with a small amount of Mg-poor orthopyroxene.

If, on the other hand, (101429) is a relatively recent\naddition to the Martian Trojan clouds (Christou et al., 2020), its origin is\nprobably traced to high-inclination asteroid families in the Inner Main Belt.\n  For the olivine-dominated Eureka family, we find that the two smaller\nasteroids are more spectrally similar to one another than to (5261) Eureka.\nSpectral profiles of all three asteroids are closely similar shortward of\n$\\sim$0.7$\\mu$m but diverge at longer wavelengths.

This problem is called place\nrecognition. In recent years, LiDAR scan based place recognition has drawn\nattention as it is robust against the appearance change. In this paper, we\npropose a LiDAR-based place recognition method, named Differentiable Scan\nContext with Orientation (DiSCO), which simultaneously finds the scan at a\nsimilar place and estimates their relative orientation. The orientation can\nfurther be used as the initial value for the down-stream local optimal metric\npose estimation, improving the pose estimation especially when a large\norientation between the current scan and retrieved scan exists. Our key idea is\nto transform the feature into the frequency domain. We utilize the magnitude of\nthe spectrum as the place signature, which is theoretically rotation-invariant.\nIn addition, based on the differentiable phase correlation, we can efficiently\nestimate the global optimal relative orientation using the spectrum. With such\nstructural constraints, the network can be learned in an end-to-end manner, and\nthe backbone is fully shared by the two tasks, achieving interpretability and\nlight weight.

Various methods have\nbeen proposed to select the optimal vertices in a static network, however, they\nare challenged by the dynamics, i.e. the time-dependent variation of the social\nnetwork structure. Such dynamics hinder the paradigm for static networks and\nleaves a seemingly unbridgeable gap between algorithms of influence\nmaximization on static networks and those on dynamic ones. In this paper, we\nextend our previous work and demonstrate that conjugate learning automata (an\nelementary variant of reinforcement learning) that have been successfully\napplied to maximize influence on static networks can be applied to dynamic\nnetworks as well. The network dynamics is measured by the variation of the\ninfluence range and absorbed into the learning procedure. Our proposal\ndelicately formulates the effect of network dynamics: the more the influence\nrange varies, the more likely the seeds are to be learned from scratch. Under\nthis assumption, the continuity of the network variation is fully taken\nadvantage of. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world networks\nverify the privileges of our proposal against alternative methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 2020 12:39:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-22"}

This\nwork provides such a characterization for the practically relevant case of G\nbeing any compact group.

The\nresults were analyzed in three periods: One of 6 months around the detection of\nIceCube-170922A, coinciding with a flare period of TXS 0506+056, a second one\nof 110 days during which the IceCube collaboration found an excess of 13\nneutrinos from a direction compatible with TXS 0506+056, and a third one from\n2004 January 1 up to 2018 August 31, over which the Pierre Auger Observatory\nhas been taking data. The sensitivity of the Observatory is addressed for\ndifferent spectral indices by considering the fluxes that would induce a single\nexpected event during the observation period. For indices compatible with those\nmeasured by the IceCube collaboration the expected number of neutrinos at the\nObservatory is well-below one. Spectral indices as hard as 1.5 would have to\napply in this energy range to expect a single event to have been detected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 2020 12:48:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-22"}

For example, many epidemic models describe\ndisease progression via a series of artificial 'stages' or 'compartments' (e.g.\nexposed, activated, infectious, etc.) but an epidemic model that explicitly\ntracks time since infection (TSI) can provide a more precise description. At\npresent, epidemic models with 'compartments' are more common than TSI models ,\nlargely due to higher computational cost and complexity typically associated\nwith TSI models.

However, this is still\nlower than inorganic solar cells, for which PCEs >20% are commonplace. A key\nreason is that OSCs still show low open-circuit voltages (Voc) relative to\ntheir optical band gaps, attributed to non-radiative recombination. For OSCs to\ncompete with inorganics in efficiency, all non-radiative loss pathways must be\nidentified and where possible, removed. Here, we show that in most NFA OSCs,\nthe majority of charge recombination at open-circuit proceeds via formation of\nnon-emissive NFA triplet excitons (T1); in the benchmark PM6:Y6 blend, this\nfraction reaches 90%, contributing 60 mV to the reduction of Voc. We develop a\nnew design to prevent recombination via this non-radiative channel through the\nengineering of significant hybridisation between the NFA T1 and the\nspin-triplet charge transfer exciton (3CTE). We model that the rate of the back\ncharge transfer from 3CTE to T1 can be reduced by an order of magnitude,\nallowing re-dissociation of the 3CTE. We then demonstrate NFA systems where T1\nformation is suppressed. This work therefore provides a clear design pathway\nfor improved OSC performance to 20% PCE and beyond.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 2020 13:10:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-27"}

In this paper, we consider uplink communications with a hybrid\nbeamforming structure and focus on improving the spectral efficiency (SE) and\nenergy efficiency (EE) of mmWave multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-NOMA\nsystems with enhanced user grouping and power allocation. Exploiting the\ndirectionality feature of mmWave channels, we first propose a novel initial\nagglomerative nesting (AGNES) based user grouping algorithm by taking advantage\nof the channel correlations. It is noted that the optimization of the SE/EE is\na challenging task due to the non-linear programming nature of the\ncorresponding problem involving user grouping, beam selection, and power\nallocation. Our idea is to decompose the overall optimization problem into a\nmixed integer problem comprising of user grouping and beam selection only,\nfollowed by a continuous problem involving power allocation and digital\nbeamforming design. To avoid the prohibitively high complexity of the\nbrute-force search approach, we propose two suboptimal low-complexity user\ngrouping and beam selection schemes, the direct AGNES (DIR-AGNES) scheme and\nthe successive AGNES (SUC-AGNES) scheme. We also introduce the quadratic\ntransform (QT) to recast the non-convex power allocation optimization problem\ninto a convex one subject to a minimum required data rate of each user.

The\nforcing gives rise to jets in the atmosphere and currents in the ocean, which\nspontaneously develop turbulent eddies through the baroclinic instability. A\ncritical step in the development of a theory of climate is to properly include\nthe resulting eddy-induced turbulent transport of properties like heat,\nmoisture, and carbon. The baroclinic instability generates flow structures at\nthe Rossby deformation radius, a length scale of order 1000 km in the\natmosphere and 100 km in the ocean, smaller than the planetary scale and the\ntypical extent of ocean basins respectively. There is therefore a separation of\nscales between the large-scale temperature gradient and the smaller eddies that\nadvect it randomly, inducing effective diffusion. Numerical solutions of the\ntwo-layer quasi-geostrophic model, the standard model for studies of eddy\nmotions in the atmosphere and ocean, show that such scale separation remains in\nthe strongly nonlinear turbulent regime, provided there is sufficient bottom\ndrag.

The\nedge sign captures the polarity of a relationship. Balance of signed networks\nis a well-studied property in graph theory. In a balanced (sub)graph, the\nvertices can be partitioned into two subsets with negative edges present only\nacross the partitions. Balanced portions of a graph have been shown to increase\ncoherence among its members and lead to better performance. While existing\nworks have focused primarily on finding the largest balanced subgraph inside a\ngraph, we study the network design problem of maximizing balance of a target\ncommunity (subgraph). In particular, given a budget $b$ and a community of\ninterest within the signed network, we aim to make the community as close to\nbeing balanced as possible by deleting up to $b$ edges. Besides establishing\nNP-hardness, we also show that the problem is non-monotone and non-submodular.\nTo overcome these computational challenges, we propose heuristics based on the\nspectral relation of balance with the Laplacian spectrum of the network. Since\nthe spectral approach lacks approximation guarantees, we further design a\ngreedy algorithm, and its randomized version, with provable bounds on the\napproximation quality. The bounds are derived by exploiting\npseudo-submodularity of the balance maximization function. Empirical evaluation\non eight real-world signed networks establishes that the proposed algorithms\nare effective, efficient, and scalable to graphs with millions of edges.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 2020 13:32:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-22"}

The Rooney Rule is an\nintervention developed to counter implicit bias and has been implemented in the\nprivate and public sectors. The Rooney Rule requires that a selection panel\ninclude at least one candidate from an underrepresented group in their\nshortlist of candidates. Recently, Kleinberg and Raghavan proposed a model of\nimplicit bias and studied the effectiveness of the Rooney Rule when applied to\na single selection decision. However, selection decisions often occur\nrepeatedly over time. Further, it has been observed that, given consistent\ncounterstereotypical feedback, implicit biases against underrepresented\ncandidates can change.\n  We consider a model of how a selection panel's implicit bias changes over\ntime given their hiring decisions either with or without the Rooney Rule in\nplace. Our main result is that, when the panel is constrained by the Rooney\nRule, their implicit bias roughly reduces at a rate that is the inverse of the\nsize of the shortlist--independent of the number of candidates, whereas without\nthe Rooney Rule, the rate is inversely proportional to the number of\ncandidates. Thus, when the number of candidates is much larger than the size of\nthe shortlist, the Rooney Rule enables a faster reduction in implicit bias,\nproviding an additional reason in favor of using it as a strategy to mitigate\nimplicit bias. Towards empirically evaluating the long-term effect of the\nRooney Rule in repeated selection decisions, we conduct an iterative candidate\nselection experiment on Amazon MTurk. We observe that, indeed, decision-makers\nsubject to the Rooney Rule select more minority candidates in addition to those\nrequired by the rule itself than they would if no rule is in effect, and do so\nwithout considerably decreasing the utility of candidates selected.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 2020 13:33:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-22"}

In continual environments, datasets acquired under\ndifferent conditions arrive sequentially; and each is only available for a\nlimited period of time. Given the inherent privacy risks associated with\nmedical data, this setup reflects the reality of deployment for deep learning\ndiagnostic radiology systems. Many techniques exist to learn continuously for\nimage classification, and several have been adapted to semantic segmentation.\nYet most struggle to accumulate knowledge in a meaningful manner. Instead, they\nfocus on preventing the problem of catastrophic forgetting, even when this\nreduces model plasticity and thereon burdens the training process. This puts\ninto question whether the additional overhead of knowledge preservation is\nworth it - particularly for medical image segmentation, where computation\nrequirements are already high - or if maintaining separate models would be a\nbetter solution.

The extra edge can either be selected\nadversarially, in which case we are interested in the largest possible value\nthat the MD can take, or uniformly at random, in which case we are interested\nin the distribution of the MD. The adversarial setting has already been studied\nby [Eroh et. al., 2015] for general graphs, who found an example where the MD\ndoubles on adding a single edge.

The model also shows that the collateral\nframework can be understood, beyond its aim to protect the central bank, as\nfinancial stability and non-conventional monetary policy instrument.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 2020 14:22:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-22"}

Since the first in-situ measurements in 1831 of its location in\nthe Canadian arctic, the pole has drifted inexorably towards Siberia,\naccelerating between 1990 and 2005 from its historic speed of 0-15 km/yr to its\npresent speed of 50-60 km/yr. In late October 2017 the north magnetic pole\ncrossed the international date line, passing within 390 km of the geographic\npole, and is now moving southwards. Here we show that over the last two decades\nthe position of the north magnetic pole has been largely determined by two\nlarge-scale lobes of negative magnetic flux on the core-mantle-boundary under\nCanada and Siberia. Localised modelling shows that elongation of the Canadian\nlobe, likely caused by an alteration in the pattern of core-flow between 1970\nand 1999, significantly weakened its signature on Earth's surface causing the\npole to accelerate towards Siberia. A range of simple models that capture this\nprocess indicate that over the next decade the north magnetic pole will\ncontinue on its current trajectory travelling a further 390-660 km towards\nSiberia.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 2020 14:32:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-22"}

To overcome the problem, we propose CADNet,\na novel contextualized attention-based distillation approach, which applies\nboth cross-attention and self-attention to obtain ASR-robust contextualized\nembedding representations of the passage and dialogue history for performance\nimprovements. We also introduce the spoken conventional knowledge distillation\nframework to distill the ASR-robust knowledge from the estimated probabilities\nof the teacher model to the student. We conduct extensive experiments on the\nSpoken-CoQA dataset and demonstrate that our approach achieves remarkable\nperformance in this task.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 2020 15:17:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 27 Feb 2021 02:17:26 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 14 Jun 2021 20:04:11 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 24 Jun 2021 16:32:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-25"}

The efficiency of the method\nderives from a functional central limit theorem approximation of the\nlikelihood, valid for large populations. We demonstrate the methodology by\nanalysing the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK, based on\nage-structured data for the number of deaths. This includes maximum a\nposteriori estimates, MCMC sampling of the posterior, computation of the model\nevidence, and the determination of parameter sensitivities via the Fisher\ninformation matrix.

We have previously developed a computational\nmodel that was used to describe in detail the effect of flow heterogeneities on\ntissue oxygen levels. The main result in that paper was that, for a general\nclass of capillary networks, perturbations of segment diameters or conductances\nalways lead to decreased oxygen levels. This result was verified using both\nnumerical simulations and mathematical analysis. However, the analysis depended\non a novel conjecture concerning the Laplace operator of functions related to\nthe segment flow rates and how they depend on the conductances. The goal of\nthis paper is to give a mathematically rigorous proof of the conjecture for a\ngeneral class of networks. The proof depends on determining the number of trees\nand forests in certain graphs arising from the capillary network.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Oct 2020 14:23:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-23"}

We also show\nthat our models effectively utilize textual con-text and benefit from\ngeneral-purpose unsupervised pretraining.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 23:12:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-17"}

For the optical signal, this\ninteraction can be strongly enhanced by using dielectric slot-waveguide\nstructures that exploit a field discontinuity at the interface between a\nhigh-index waveguide core and the low-index EO cladding. In contrast to this,\nthe electrical signal is usually applied through conductive regions in the\ndirect vicinity of the optical waveguide. To avoid excessive optical loss, the\nconductivity of these regions is maintained at a moderate level, thus leading\nto inherent RC-limitations of the modulation bandwidth. In this paper, we show\nthat these limitations can be overcome by extending the slot-waveguide concept\nto the modulating radio-frequency (RF) signal. Our device combines an RF\nslotline that relies on BaTiO3 as a high-k dielectric material with a\nconventional silicon photonic slot waveguide and a highly efficient organic EO\ncladding material. In a proof-of-concept experiment, we demonstrate a 1 mm-long\nMach-Zehnder modulator that offers a 3 dB-bandwidth of 76 GHz and a 6\ndB-bandwidth of 110 GHz along with a small {\\pi}-voltage of 1.3 V (U{\\pi}L =\n1.3 V mm). To the best of our knowledge, this represents the largest EO\nbandwidth so far achieved with a silicon photonic modulator based on dielectric\nwaveguides. We further demonstrate the viability of the device in a data\ntransmission experiment using four-state pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM4) at\nline rates up to 200 Gbit/s. Our first-generation devices leave vast room for\nfurther improvement and may open an attractive route towards highly efficient\nsilicon photonic modulators that combine sub-1 mm device lengths with sub-1 V\ndrive voltages and modulation bandwidths of more than 100 GHz.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Oct 2020 19:30:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-20"}
