This phenomenon arises due to the fact that\nconventional network compression methods only preserve the predictions of the\nnetwork while ignoring the quality of the attributions.

These\nultra-short-period planets (USPs) likely did not form in their present-day\norbits, but rather migrated from larger initial separations. While tides are\nthe probable cause of this migration, the tidal source has remained uncertain.\nHere we introduce planetary obliquity tides as a natural pathway for the\nproduction of USPs within close-in multi-planet systems. The crucial idea is\nthat tidal dissipation generally forces planetary spin vectors to equilibrium\nconfigurations called \"Cassini states\", in which the planetary obliquities\n(axial tilts) are non-zero. In these cases, sustained tidal dissipation and\ninward orbital migration are inevitable. Migration then increases the obliquity\nand strengthens the tides, creating a positive feedback loop. Thus, if a\nplanet's initial semi-major axis is small enough ($a \\lesssim 0.05$ AU), it can\nexperience runaway orbital decay, which is stalled at ultra-short orbital\nperiods when the forced obliquity reaches very high values ($\\sim 85^{\\circ}$)\nand becomes unstable. We use secular dynamics to outline the parameter space in\nwhich the innermost member of a prototypical Kepler multiple-planet system can\nbecome a USP. We find that these conditions are consistent with many observed\nfeatures of USPs, such as period ratios, mutual inclinations, and occurrence\nrate trends with stellar type. Future detections of stellar obliquities and\nclose-in companions, together with theoretical explorations of the potential\nfor chaotic obliquity dynamics, can help constrain the prevalence of this\nmechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Oct 2020 17:01:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-23"}

In particular, it is unclear what dynamical patterns arise in\ntrained RNNs, and how those patterns depend on the training dataset or task.\nThis work addresses these questions in the context of a specific natural\nlanguage processing task: text classification. Using tools from dynamical\nsystems analysis, we study recurrent networks trained on a battery of both\nnatural and synthetic text classification tasks. We find the dynamics of these\ntrained RNNs to be both interpretable and low-dimensional. Specifically, across\narchitectures and datasets, RNNs accumulate evidence for each class as they\nprocess the text, using a low-dimensional attractor manifold as the underlying\nmechanism. Moreover, the dimensionality and geometry of the attractor manifold\nare determined by the structure of the training dataset; in particular, we\ndescribe how simple word-count statistics computed on the training dataset can\nbe used to predict these properties. Our observations span multiple\narchitectures and datasets, reflecting a common mechanism RNNs employ to\nperform text classification. To the degree that integration of evidence towards\na decision is a common computational primitive, this work lays the foundation\nfor using dynamical systems techniques to study the inner workings of RNNs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Oct 2020 17:58:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 3 Jun 2022 17:05:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-06"}

This paper investigates obliquity evolution in stellar binaries\nhosting modestly-inclined circumbinary disks. As the disk and binary axes\nundergo mutual precession, each oblate star experiences a torque from its\ncompanion star, so that the spin and orbital axes undergo mutual precession. As\nthe disk loses mass through a combination of winds and accretion, the system\nmay be captured into a high-obliquity Cassini state (a spin-orbit resonance).\nThe final obliquity depends on the details of the disk dispersal. We construct\na simple disk model to emulate disk dispersal due to viscous accretion and\nphotoevaporation, and identify the necessary disk properties for producing the\nobserved obliquities in DI Herculis. The disk must be massive (at least $10 \\%$\nof the binary mass). If accretion onto the binary is suppressed, the observed\nhigh stellar obliquities are reproduced with a binary-disk inclination of $\\sim\n5^\\circ - 10^\\circ$, but if substantial accretion occurs, the inclination must\nbe larger, $\\sim 20^\\circ - 30^\\circ$. If moderate accretion occurs, initially\nthe disk must lose its mass slowly, but eventually lose its remaining mass\nabruptly, analogous to the observed two-timescale behavior for disks around\nT-Tauri stars. The spin feedback on the binary orbit causes the binary-disk\ninclination to decay as the obliquity evolves, a feature that is absent from\nthe standard Cassini state treatment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Oct 2020 18:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2020 17:36:21 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-13"}

The mean profile calculated from both dark and luminous tracers are\nsimilar in shape, exhibiting a large degree of halo-to-halo scatter around the\naverage profile. The so-called \"splashback\" radius demarcates the outer\nboundary of the halo, and manifests as a kink in the velocity dispersion\nprofile, located on average between $\\sim 1.0-1.5r_{200m}$, where $r_{200m}$ is\nthe radius within which the enclosed density of the halo equals 200 times the\nmean background density of the universe at that redshift.

We\nfurther show that the scatter in the velocity dispersion profiles may be\nattributed to the variations in the assembly history of the host halos.

Finally, we show that a two-parameter model can be used to\nfit the measured velocity dispersion profiles and the fit parameters can be\nrelated directly to two fundamental halo properties: mass and concentration.

One such example is the Gravitational-wave Optical\nTransient Observer (GOTO), whose primary science objective is the optical\nfollow-up of Gravitational Wave events. The amount and rate of data production\nby GOTO and other wide-area, high-cadence surveys presents a significant\nchallenge to data processing pipelines which need to operate in near real-time\nto fully exploit the time-domain.

We focus on two processes: tidal disruption from very close\nencounters with a giant planet, and loss of surface volatiles from repeated\npassages close to the Sun. We show that the rate of tidal disruption is more\nthan a factor of two higher for ejected planetesimals than for surviving\nobjects in the Kuiper belt or Oort cloud. Ejected planetesimals are\npreferentially disrupted by Jupiter and surviving ones by Neptune. Given that\nthe gas giants contracted significantly as they cooled but the ice giants did\nnot, taking into account the thermal evolution of the giant planets decreases\nthe disruption rate of ejected planetesimals. The frequency of volatile loss\nand extinction is far higher for ejected planetesimals than for surviving ones\nand is not affected by the giant planets' contraction. Even if all interstellar\nobjects were ejected from Solar System-like systems, our analysis suggests that\ntheir physical properties should be more diverse than those of Solar System\nsmall bodies as a result of their divergent dynamical histories.

Moreover, any black hole far away from\nequilibrium, such as one initially formed in a compact binary merger or by the\ncollapse of a massive star, will eventually reach a final equilibrium Kerr\nstate. At sufficiently late times in this process of reaching equilibrium, we\nexpect that the black hole is modeled as a perturbation around the final state.\nThe emitted gravitational waves will then be damped sinusoids with frequencies\nand damping times given by the quasinormal mode spectrum of the final Kerr\nblack hole. An observational test of this scenario, often referred to as black\nhole spectroscopy, is one of the major goals of gravitational wave astronomy.\nIt was recently suggested that the quasinormal mode description including the\nhigher overtones might hold even right after the remnant black hole is first\nformed. At these times, the black hole is expected to be highly dynamical and\nnonlinear effects are likely to be important. In this paper we investigate this\nremarkable scenario in terms of the horizon dynamics. Working with high\naccuracy simulations of a simple configuration, namely the head-on collision of\ntwo nonspinning black holes with unequal masses, we study the dynamics of the\nfinal common horizon in terms of its shear and its multipole moments. We show\nthat they are indeed well described by a superposition of ringdown modes as\nlong as a sufficiently large number of higher overtones are included.

For the online optimization, we propose a swapping\ngreedy algorithm that first construct an initial set of sensors using leverage\nscores and then swap the chosen sensors with other candidates until certain\nconvergence criteria are met. We demonstrate the efficiency and scalability of\nthe proposed computational framework by a linear inverse problem of inferring\nthe initial condition for an advection-diffusion equation, and a nonlinear\ninverse problem of inferring the diffusion coefficient of a log-normal\ndiffusion equation, with both the parameter and data dimensions ranging from a\nfew tens to a few thousands.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Oct 2020 19:30:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-09"}

Studies of galaxy populations at\ndifferent redshifts reveal that the balance of morphologies has changed over\ntime, but such snapshots cannot uncover the typical timescales over which\nindividual galaxies undergo morphological transformation, nor which are the\nprogenitors of today's galaxies of different types. However, these studies also\nshow a strong link between morphology and star-formation rate over a large\nrange in redshift, which offers an alternative probe of morphological\ntransformation.

The\nchiral p-wave pairing realized in He-3 A-phase was favored by several early\nexperiments, in particular, the muon spin rotation and the Knight shift\nmeasurements published in 1998. However, the original Knight shift result was\ncalled into question in early 2019, raising the question as to whether the\nchiral p-wave, or even the spin-triplet pairing itself, is indeed realized in\nSRO. In this brief pedagogical review, we will address this question by\ncounterposing the currently accepted results of Knight shift, polarized neutron\nscattering (PNS), spin counterflow half-quantum vortex (HQV), and Josephson\nexperiments with predictions made both by standard BCS theory and by more\ngeneral arguments based only on (1) the symmetry of the Hamiltonian including\nthe spin-orbital terms, (2) thermodynamics, and (3) the qualitative\nexperimental features of SRO. We also introduce a notation for triplet states\nalternative to the more popular d-vector one which we believe well suited to\nSRO. We conclude that the most recent Knight shift and PNS experiments do not\nexclude in the bulk the odd-parity, spin-triplet \"helical\" states allowed by\nthe symmetry group of SRO but do exclude the chiral p-wave state. On the other\nhand, the Josephson and the HQV experiments showed that the pairing in SRO\ncannot be of the even-parity, spin-singlet type, and in the surface region or\nin samples of mesoscopic size, the d-vector must have a c-axis component, thus\nexcluding apparently all bulk p-wave states except the chiral p-wave. Possible\nresolution of this rather glaring prima facie contradiction is discussed,\ntaking into account other important experiments on SRO touched upon only\nbriefly in this article.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Oct 2020 20:38:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-30"}

Just to\nmention one out of many possible examples, technologies such as Virtual LANs\n(VLANs) struggle to address the scalability and operational requirements\nintroduced by Internet of Things (IoT) use cases. To keep up with these\nchallenges we have identified four main requirements that are common across\nmodern enterprise networks: (i) scalable mobility, (ii) endpoint segmentation,\n(iii) simplified administration, and (iv) resource optimization.

We present our experience with deploying SDA in two\nreal-life scenarios: an enterprise campus, and a large warehouse with mobile\nrobots. Our evaluation shows that SDA, when compared with traditional\nenterprise networks, can (i) reduce overall data plane forwarding state up to\n70% thanks to a reactive protocol using a centralized routing server, and (ii)\nreduce by an order of magnitude the handover delays in scenarios of massive\nmobility with respect to other approaches.

Motivated by\nthis progress, we study the effects of static disorder on topological Thouless\ncharge pumping. We focus on the half-filled Rice-Mele model of free spinless\nfermions and consider random diagonal disorder. In the instantaneous basis, we\ncompute the polarization, the entanglement spectrum, and the local Chern\nmarker. As a first main result, we conclude that the space-integrated local\nChern marker is best suited for a quantitative determination of topological\ntransitions in a disordered system. In the time-dependent simulations, we use\nthe time-integrated current to obtain the pumped charge in slowly periodically\ndriven systems. As a second main result, we observe and characterize a\ndisorder-driven breakdown of the quantized charge pump. There is an excellent\nagreement between the static and the time-dependent ways of computing the\npumped charge. The topological transition occurs well in the regime where all\nstates are localized on the given system sizes and is therefore not tied to a\ndelocalization-localization transition of Hamiltonian eigenstates. For\nindividual disorder realizations, the breakdown of the quantized pumping occurs\nfor parameters where the spectral bulk gap inherited from the band gap of the\nclean system closes, leading to a globally gapless spectrum. As a third main\nresult and with respect to the analysis of finite-size systems, we show that\nthe disorder average of the bulk gap severely overestimates the stability of\nquantized pumping. A much better estimate is the typical value of the\ndistribution of energy gaps, also called mode of the distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Oct 2020 21:37:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Apr 2021 14:47:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 30 Apr 2021 12:19:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-03"}

So\npredictable paths become vital. The cognitive effort for the human to predict\nthe robot's path becomes untenable as the number of robots increases. As the\nnumber of humans increase, it also makes it harder for the robots to move while\nconsidering the motion of multiple humans. Additionally, if new people are\nentering the space -- like in restaurants, banks, and hospitals -- they would\nhave less familiarity with the trajectories typically taken by the robots; this\nfurther increases the needs for predictable robot motion along paths.\n  With this in mind, we propose to minimize the navigation-graph of the robot\nfor position-based predictability, which is predictability from just the\ncurrent position of the robot. This is important since the human cannot be\nexpected to keep track of the goals and prior actions of the robot in addition\nto doing their own tasks. In this paper, we define measures for position-based\npredictability, then present and evaluate a hill-climbing algorithm to minimize\nthe navigation-graph (directed graph) of robot motion.

Prior work has\nidentified a variety of pathological behaviours that arise in RL algorithms\nthat combine approximate on-policy evaluation and greedification. One prominent\nexample is policy oscillation, wherein an algorithm may cycle indefinitely\nbetween policies, rather than converging to a fixed point. What is not well\nunderstood however is the quality of the policies in the region of oscillation.\nIn this paper we present simple examples illustrating that in addition to\npolicy oscillation and multiple fixed points -- the same basic issue can lead\nto convergence to the worst possible policy for a given approximation. Such\nbehaviours can arise when algorithms optimize evaluation accuracy weighted by\nthe distribution of states that occur under the current policy, but greedify\nbased on the value of states which are rare or nonexistent under this\ndistribution. This means the values used for greedification are unreliable and\ncan steer the policy in undesirable directions. Our observation that this can\nlead to the worst possible policy shows that in a general sense such algorithms\nare unreliable. The existence of such examples helps to narrow the kind of\ntheoretical guarantees that are possible and the kind of algorithmic ideas that\nare likely to be helpful. We demonstrate analytically and experimentally that\nsuch pathological behaviours can impact a wide range of RL and dynamic\nprogramming algorithms; such behaviours can arise both with and without\nbootstrapping, and with linear function approximation as well as with more\ncomplex parameterized functions like neural networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Oct 2020 22:57:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-30"}

The\nkey idea to simultaneously achieve tracking and balancing tasks is to design\ncontrol strategies in slow- and fast-time scales, respectively. In slow-time\nscale, model predictive control (MPC) is used to generate the desired internal\nsubsystem trajectory that encodes the external subsystem tracking performance\nand control input. In fast-time scale, the actual internal trajectory is\nstabilized to the desired internal trajectory by using an inverse dynamics\ncontroller. The coupling effects between the external and internal subsystems\nare captured through the planned internal trajectory profile and the dual\nstructural properties of the robotic systems. The control design is based on\nGaussian processes (GPs) regression model that are learned from experiments\nwithout need of priori knowledge about the robot dynamics nor successful\nbalance demonstration. The GPs provide estimates of modeling uncertainties of\nthe robotic systems and these uncertainty estimations are incorporated in the\nMPC design to enhance the control robustness to modeling errors.

In this study, we employ high frequency (240 GHz)\nelectron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy on plate-like CrBr$_{3}$ to gain\ninsight into the magnetic interactions as a function of temperature (200 - 4 K)\nand the angle of rotation ${\\theta}$. We find that the temperature dependence\nof the ESR linewidth is well described by the Ginzberg-Landau critical model as\nwell as Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition model, indicative of\nthe presence of two-dimensional (2D) correlations. This suggests that the\nthree-dimensional ferromagnet CrBr$_{3}$, which has been described as an Ising\nor Heisenberg ferromagnet, could present 2D magnetic correlations and BKT-like\nbehavior even in its bulk form; an observation that, to the best of our\nknowledge, has not been reported in the literature. Furthermore, our findings\nshow that the resonance field follows a $(3cos^2{\\theta} - 1)$-like angular\ndependence, while the linewidth follows a $(3cos^2{\\theta} - 1)^2$-like angular\ndependence. This observed angular dependence of the resonance field and\nlinewidth further confirm an unanticipated 2D magnetic behavior in CrBr$_{3}$.\nThis behavior is likely due to the interaction of the external magnetic field\napplied during the ESR experiment that allows for the mediation of long-range\nvortex-like correlations between the spin clusters that may have formed due to\nmagnetic phase separation. This study demonstrates the significance of\nemploying spin sensitive techniques such as ESR to better understand the\nmagnetic correlations in similar van der Waals magnets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Oct 2020 03:41:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-07"}

However, it has been under debate on how high its Tc can\nreally reach due to the inconsistency of the results obtained from the\ntransport, magnetic and spectroscopic measurements. Here we report\nspectroscopic evidence of superconductivity pairing at 83 K in single-layer\nFeSe/STO films. By preparing high-quality single-layer FeSe/STO films, we\nobserve for the first time strong superconductivity-induced Bogoliubov\nback-bending bands that extend to rather high binding energy ~100 meV by\nhigh-resolution angle-resolved photoemission measurements. The Bogoliubov\nback-bending band provides a new definitive benchmark of superconductivity\npairing that is directly observed up to 83 K in the single-layer FeSe/STO\nfilms. Moreover, we find that the superconductivity pairing state can be\nfurther divided into two temperature regions of 64-83 K and below 64 K. We\npropose the 64-83 K region may be attributed to superconductivity fluctuation\nwhile the region below 64 K corresponds to the realization of long-range\nsuperconducting phase coherence. These results indicate that either Tc as high\nas 83 K is achievable in iron-based superconductors, or there is a pseudogap\nformation from superconductivity fluctuation in single-layer FeSe/STO films.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Oct 2020 05:46:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-24"}

However,\nthe normal training paradigm, i.e., fitting a recommender model to recover the\nuser behavior data with pointwise or pairwise loss, makes the model biased\ntowards popular items. This results in the terrible Matthew effect, making\npopular items be more frequently recommended and become even more popular.\nExisting work addresses this issue with Inverse Propensity Weighting (IPW),\nwhich decreases the impact of popular items on the training and increases the\nimpact of long-tail items. Although theoretically sound, IPW methods are highly\nsensitive to the weighting strategy, which is notoriously difficult to tune. In\nthis work, we explore the popularity bias issue from a novel and fundamental\nperspective -- cause-effect. We identify that popularity bias lies in the\ndirect effect from the item node to the ranking score, such that an item's\nintrinsic property is the cause of mistakenly assigning it a higher ranking\nscore. To eliminate popularity bias, it is essential to answer the\ncounterfactual question that what the ranking score would be if the model only\nuses item property. To this end, we formulate a causal graph to describe the\nimportant cause-effect relations in the recommendation process. During\ntraining, we perform multi-task learning to achieve the contribution of each\ncause; during testing, we perform counterfactual inference to remove the effect\nof item popularity. Remarkably, our solution amends the learning process of\nrecommendation which is agnostic to a wide range of models -- it can be easily\nimplemented in existing methods. We demonstrate it on Matrix Factorization (MF)\nand LightGCN [20].

Existing state-time\nplanners are typically implemented based on randomized sampling approaches or\npath searching on discretized state graph. The smoothness, path clearance, and\nplanning efficiency of these planners are usually not satisfying. In this work,\nwe propose a gradient-based planner over the state-time space for online\ntrajectory generation in highly dynamic environments. To enable the\ngradient-based optimization, we propose a Timed-ESDT that supports distance and\ngradient queries with state-time keys. Based on the Timed-ESDT, we also define\na smooth prior and an obstacle likelihood function that is compatible with the\nstate-time space. The trajectory planning is then formulated to a MAP problem\nand solved by an efficient numerical optimizer. Moreover, to improve the\noptimality of the planner, we also define a state-time graph and then conduct\npath searching on it to find a better initialization for the optimizer. By\nintegrating the graph searching, the planning quality is significantly\nimproved. Experiment results on simulated and benchmark datasets show that our\nplanner can outperform the state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its\nsignificant advantages over the traditional ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Oct 2020 06:04:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-30"}

In the calculations, LDA functional was\nused instead of PBE functional. The electronic structure of SnO$_2$ obtained by\nthis method is quite compatible with the experimental data. The SnO$_2$ has an\nimportant usage area in optoelectronic devices due to its transparent and\nconductive nature. One of these important areas is the use of SnO$_2$ as an\nelectron transport layer (ETL) in perovskite solar cells. Therefore, the energy\nlevel of the conduction band of the SnO$_2$ is important. In the Pb doped\nSnO$_2$ cases, the band gap narrows as the Pb doping rate increases. The\nbandgap of SnO$_2$ can be narrowed from 3.60 eV to 3.02 eV with a %12.5 Pb\ndoping ratio, and this narrowing is proportional to the amount of Pb. The\ncalculation results obtained in this study show that the decrease in the energy\nlevel of the bottom of the conduction band plays an important role in the\nnarrowing of the band gap and there is no significant change in the energy\nlevel of the top of the valence band. Due to this effect of the Pb atom, the\nenergy level of the conduction band can be adjusted by using the doping ratio\nof the Pb atom and the band gap can be narrowed in a controlled manner. With\nthe Pb doping, the energy levels of the SnO$_2$ ETL can be adjusted in a range\naccording to the type of perovskite used in solar cell.

Investigating\nthe solution to a min-max optimization (which considers the worst-case loss in\nthe presence of adversarial perturbations) we introduce a generalization to the\nmax-margin classifier which takes into account the power of the adversary in\nmanipulating the data. We refer to this classifier as the \"Robust Max-margin\"\n(RM) classifier. Under some mild assumptions on the loss function, we\ntheoretically show that the gradient descent iterates (with sufficiently small\nstep size) converge to the RM classifier in its direction. Therefore, the RM\nclassifier can be studied to compute various performance measures (e.g.\ngeneralization error) of binary classification with adversarial perturbations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Oct 2020 07:20:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-30"}

Dynamical field inference (DFI) addresses the\nproblem of reconstructing a stochastically driven, dynamically evolving field\nfrom finite data. It relies on information field theory (IFT), the information\ntheory for fields. Here, the relations of DFI, IFT, and the recently developed\nsupersymmetric theory of stochastics (STS) are established in a pedagogical\ndiscussion. In IFT, field expectation values can be calculated from the\npartition function of the full space-time inference problem. The partition\nfunction of the inference problem invokes a functional Dirac function to\nguarantee the dynamics, as well as a field-dependent functional determinant, to\nestablish proper normalization, both impeding the necessary evaluation of the\npath integral over all field configurations. STS replaces these problematic\nexpressions via the introduction of fermionic ghost and bosonic Lagrange\nfields, respectively. The action of these fields has a supersymmetry, which\nmeans there exists an exchange operation between bosons and fermions that\nleaves the system invariant. In contrast to this, measurements of the dynamical\nfields do not adhere to this supersymmetry. The supersymmetry can also be\nbroken spontaneously, in which case the system evolves chaotically. This\naffects the predictability of the system and thereby make DFI more challenging.\nWe investigate the interplay of measurement constraints with the non-linear\nchaotic dynamics of a simplified, illustrative system with the help of Feynman\ndiagrams and show that the Fermionic corrections are essential to obtain the\ncorrect posterior statistics over system trajectories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Oct 2020 08:26:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 May 2021 20:02:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-22"}

For group-harmonic\nmaximization, unless $P=NP$, there is no polynomial-time algorithm that\nachieves an approximation factor better than $1-1/e$ (directed) and $1-1/(4e)$\n(undirected), even for unweighted graphs.

They\nare expected to be crucial also in discrete quantum gravity, where dynamical\nspacetime should emerge from the collective physics of the underlying quantum\ngravitational degrees of freedom. However, defining statistical equilibrium in\na background independent system is a challenging open issue, mainly due to the\nabsence of absolute notions of time and energy. This is especially so in\nnon-perturbative quantum gravity frameworks that are devoid of usual space and\ntime structures. In this thesis, we investigate aspects of a generalisation of\nstatistical equilibrium, specifically Gibbs states, suitable for background\nindependent systems. We emphasise on an information theoretic characterisation\nbased on the maximum entropy principle. Subsequently, we explore the resultant\ngeneralised Gibbs states in a discrete quantum gravitational system composed of\nmany candidate quanta of geometry, utilising their field theoretic formulation\nof group field theory and various many-body techniques. We construct several\nconcrete examples of quantum gravitational generalised Gibbs states. We further\ndevelop inequivalent thermal representations based on entangled, two-mode\nsqueezed, thermofield double vacua, induced by a class of generalised Gibbs\nstates. In these representations, we define a class of thermal condensates\nwhich encode statistical fluctuations in a given observable, e.g. volume of the\nquantum geometry. We apply these states in the condensate cosmology programme\nof group field theory to study a relational effective cosmological dynamics\nextracted from a class of free models, for homogeneous and isotropic\nspacetimes.

The first decoder computes the\nexact APPs by jointly decoding the received sequences, whereas the second\ndecoder approximates the APPs by combining the results of separately decoded\nreceived sequences. Using the proposed algorithms, we evaluate the performance\nof decoding multiple received sequences by means of achievable information\nrates and Monte-Carlo simulations. We show significant performance gains\ncompared to a single received sequence.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Oct 2020 10:15:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-30"}

The leading theory of galaxy formation\npredicts that a huge amount of baryons resides around galaxies extending out to\ntheir virial radii in the form of diffuse and hot gas of $10^6-10^7\\,$K, which\nis also known as the major component of the circumgalactic medium (CGM).\nStudies by various groups via different techniques, however, have not reached a\nconsensus on the role of CGM in accounting for the missing baryons, with the\nestimated contribution ranging from a minor fraction to enclosing the baryon\nbudget of the galaxy. In this work we attempt to measure the mass of missing\nbaryons in CGM with a novel method based on the gamma-ray observations of the\nextended halo of the Andromeda Galaxy. Since cosmic-ray particles that are\ngenerated inside the galaxy will eventually escape to the CGM, they will\nproduce gamma-ray emission via the proton-proton collision with CGM. Different\nfrom some traditional measurements which are sensitive only to gas in certain\nspecific temperature range, the hadronic gamma-ray flux is sensitive to\nbaryonic gases in all phases and does not rely on the metallicity in the halo.\nOur result suggests that the total baryon mass contained within the virial\nradius is less than $(1.4-5)\\times 10^{10}M_\\odot$ according to the gamma-ray\nintensity obtained with a model-dependent analysis. It implies that the CGM of\nAndromeda Galaxy may not account for more than $30\\%$ of the missing baryons,\nbut the result is subject to uncertainties from the gamma-ray intensity upper\nlimit, diffusion coefficient of the CRs in the halo as well as the stellar mass\nand dark matter halo mass of the galaxy. This method will become more\nconstraining provided better understandings on these issues and more sensitive\ngamma-ray telescopes in the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Oct 2020 10:53:09 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Feb 2021 12:42:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-21"}

To compute the\nsolution in the interior domain, approximations to the Dirichlet-to-Neumann\n(DtN) map of the exterior domain have to be imposed as transparent boundary\nconditions on the artificial coupling boundary. Although the DtN map can be\ncomputed by separation of variables, it is a nonlocal operator with dense\nmatrix representations, and hence computationally inefficient. Therefore,\napproximations of DtN maps by sparse matrices, usually involving additional\ndegrees of freedom, have been studied intensively in the literature using a\nvariety of approaches including different types of infinite elements, local\nnon-reflecting boundary conditions, and perfectly matched layers.

Providing robustness to adversarial attacks\nis a very challenging task especially in problems involving a large number of\nclasses, as it typically comes at the expense of an accuracy decrease. In this\nwork, we propose the Gaussian class-conditional simplex (GCCS) loss: a novel\napproach for training deep robust multiclass classifiers that provides\nadversarial robustness while at the same time achieving or even surpassing the\nclassification accuracy of state-of-the-art methods. Differently from other\nframeworks, the proposed method learns a mapping of the input classes onto\ntarget distributions in a latent space such that the classes are linearly\nseparable. Instead of maximizing the likelihood of target labels for individual\nsamples, our objective function pushes the network to produce feature\ndistributions yielding high inter-class separation. The mean values of the\ndistributions are centered on the vertices of a simplex such that each class is\nat the same distance from every other class. We show that the regularization of\nthe latent space based on our approach yields excellent classification accuracy\nand inherently provides robustness to multiple adversarial attacks, both\ntargeted and untargeted, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches over\nchallenging datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Oct 2020 11:15:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-30"}

The definition of a Cartesian differential category is based on a\ndifferential combinator which directly formalizes the total derivative from\nmultivariable calculus. However, in the aforementioned work the authors used\ntechniques from Goodwillie's functor calculus to establish a linearization\nprocess from which they then derived a differential combinator. This raised the\nquestion of what the precise relationship between linearization and having a\ndifferential combinator might be.\n  In this paper, we introduce the notion of a linearizing combinator which\nabstracts linearization in the Abelian functor calculus. We then use it to\nprovide an alternative axiomatization of a Cartesian differential category.\nEvery Cartesian differential category comes equipped with a canonical\nlinearizing combinator obtained by differentiation at zero. Conversely, a\ndifferential combinator can be constructed \\`a la BJORT when one has a system\nof partial linearizing combinators in each context. Thus, while linearizing\ncombinators do provide an alternative axiomatization of Cartesian differential\ncategories, an explicit notion of partial linearization is required. This is in\ncontrast to the situation for differential combinators where partial\ndifferentiation is automatic in the presence of total differentiation. The\nability to form a system of partial linearizing combinators from a total\nlinearizing combinator, while not being possible in general, is possible when\nthe setting is Cartesian closed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Oct 2020 11:17:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 6 Nov 2020 22:04:04 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 31 Jan 2022 18:19:33 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 18 Feb 2022 14:20:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-21"}

Globally, over half of\nroad traffic deaths are vulnerable road users. Although substantial efforts are\nbeing made to improve VRU safety from engineering solutions to law enforcement,\nthe death toll of VRUs' continues to rise. The emerging technology, Cooperative\nIntelligent Transportation System (C-ITS), has the proven potential to enhance\nroad safety by enabling wireless communication to exchange information among\nroad users. Such exchanged information is utilized for creating situational\nawareness and detecting any potential collisions in advance to take necessary\nmeasures to avoid any possible road casualties. The current state-of-the-art\nsolutions of C-ITS for VRU safety, however, are limited to unidirectional\ncommunication where VRUs are only responsible for alerting their presence to\ndrivers with the intention of avoiding collisions. This one-way interaction is\nsubstantially limiting the enormous potential of C-ITS which otherwise can be\nemployed to devise a more effective solution for the VRU safety where VRU can\nbe equipped with bidirectional communication with full C-ITS functionalities.\nTo address such problems and to explore better C-ITS solution suggestions for\nVRU, this paper reviewed and evaluated the current technologies and safety\nmethods proposed for VRU safety over the period 2007-2020.

Then, we used an improved genetic algorithm to identify\nbetter-performing architectures in the search space and investigated the\npossibility of finding a superior network architecture with fewer parameters.\nThe experimental results show that the architecture obtained using the proposed\nmethod offered a superior performance with less than 1% of the number of the\noriginal U-Net parameters in particular and with significantly fewer parameters\nthan other state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, through in-depth investigation\nof the experimental results, several effective operations and patterns of\nnetworks to generate superior retinal vessel segmentations were identified.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Oct 2020 13:31:36 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Nov 2020 08:24:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2020 06:52:55 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 11 Jun 2021 09:58:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-14"}

To suppressing the impact of\nmislabeled data, this paper proposes a conceptually simple yet efficient\ntraining block, termed as Attentive Feature Mixup (AFM), which allows paying\nmore attention to clean samples and less to mislabeled ones via sample\ninteractions in small groups. Specifically, this plug-and-play AFM first\nleverages a \\textit{group-to-attend} module to construct groups and assign\nattention weights for group-wise samples, and then uses a \\textit{mixup} module\nwith the attention weights to interpolate massive noisy-suppressed samples. The\nAFM has several appealing benefits for noise-robust deep learning. (i) It does\nnot rely on any assumptions and extra clean subset. (ii) With massive\ninterpolations, the ratio of useless samples is reduced dramatically compared\nto the original noisy ratio.

Here we investigate the secular interaction between an eccentric planet\nand a massive, external debris disk using a simple analytical model. Our\nframework accounts for both the gravitational coupling between the disk and the\nplanet, as well as the disk self-gravity -- with the limitation that it ignores\nthe non-axisymmetric component of the disk (self-)gravity.

Given this outcome\nwe propose that double-ringed debris disks, such as those around HD 107146 and\nHD 92945, could be the result of secular resonances with a yet-undetected\nplanet interior to the disk. We characterize the dependence of the properties\nof the secular resonances (i.e. locations, timescales, and widths) on the\nplanet and disk parameters, finding that the mechanism is robust provided the\ndisk is massive enough.

Assuming\nthat Si II, Si III, and Si IV comprise nearly 100% of the total silicon, we\nfind 3% ($\\sim$8$\\times$10$^3~{\\rm M_\\odot}$), 2% ($\\sim$7$\\times$10$^3~{\\rm\nM_\\odot}$), and 32--42% [$\\sim$(1.0--1.3)$\\times$10$^5~{\\rm M_\\odot}$] of the\nsilicon mass in the stars, interstellar medium, and within $0.6R_{200}$ of the\nCGM of IC1613.

This work is the\nfirst time a dwarf galaxy of such low mass is probed by a number of both QSO\nand stellar sightlines, and it shows that the CGM of low-mass gas-rich galaxies\ncan be a large reservoir enriched with metals from past and ongoing outflows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Oct 2020 14:49:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-06"}

Since then the local public health offices have been responsible to\nmonitor and react to the dynamics of the pandemic. One of their major tasks is\nto contain the spread of the virus after potential spreading events, for\nexample when one or multiple participants have a positive test result after a\ngroup meeting (e.g. at school, at a sports event or at work). In this case,\ncontacts of the infected person have to be traced and potentially are\nquarantined (at home) for a period of time. When all relevant contact persons\nobtain a negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test result, the quarantine\nmay be stopped. However, tracing and testing of all contacts is time-consuming,\ncostly and (thus) not always feasible. This motivates our work, in which we\npresent a statistical model for the probability that no transmission of\nSars-CoV-2 occurred given an arbitrary number of test results at potentially\ndifferent timepoints. Hereby, the time-dependent sensitivity and specificity of\nthe conducted PCR test are taken in account. We employ a parametric Bayesian\nmodel which can be adopted to different situations when specific prior\nknowledge is available. This is illustrated for group events in German school\nclasses and applied to exemplary real-world data from this context. Our\napproach has the potential to support important quarantine decisions with the\ngoal to achieve a better balance between necessary containment of the pandemic\nand preservation of social and economic life.

A Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model is used to\noptimise the number and locations of both primary and secondary processing\nservers so that the energy consumption of the networking equipment and\nprocessing are minimised. The results show that considering a scenario for\nserver protection without geographical constraints compared to the\nnon-resilient scenario has resulted in both network and processing energy\npenalty as the traffic is doubled. The results also reveal that increasing the\nlevel of resilience to consider geographical constraints compared to case\nwithout geographical constraints resulted in higher network energy penalty when\nthe demand is low as more nodes are utilised to place the processing servers\nunder the geographic constraints.

Objective: To improve\nthe understanding of the liaison of developers' activities and software\ncomplexity within a refactoring task, namely by evaluating if process metrics\ngathered from the IDE, using process mining methods and tools, are suitable to\naccurately classify different refactoring practices and the resulting software\ncomplexity. Method: We mined source code metrics from a software product after\na quality improvement task was given in parallel to (117) software developers,\norganized in (71) teams. Simultaneously, we collected events from their IDE\nwork sessions (320) and used process mining to model their processes and\nextract the correspondent metrics. Results: Most teams using a plugin for\nrefactoring (JDeodorant) reduced software complexity more effectively and with\nsimpler processes than the ones that performed refactoring using only Eclipse\nnative features.

We tested the hypothesis that\nthe composition of the seed bank undergoes lower temporal variability than the\nstanding vegetation in a nine-year study in Mediterranean, semi-arid, and arid\necosystems. The composition of the seed bank was estimated by collecting soil\ncores from the studied sites on an annual basis. Seedling emergence under\noptimal watering conditions was measured in each soil core for three\nconsecutive years, to account for seed dormancy. In all sites, the composition\nof the seed bank differed from the vegetation throughout the years.\nSmall-seeded and dormant-seeded species had a higher frequency in the seed bank\nthan in the standing vegetation. In contrast, functional group membership\n(grasses vs. forbs) did not explain differences in species frequency between\nthe seed bank and the vegetation after controlling for differences between\ngrasses and forbs in seed mass and seed dormancy. Contrary to predictions, the\nmagnitude of year-to-year variability (the mean compositional dissimilarity\nbetween consecutive years) was not lower in the seed bank than in the\nvegetation in all sites. However, long-term compositional trends in the seed\nbank were weaker than in the vegetation in the Mediterranean and semi-arid\nsites. In the arid site where year-to-year variability was highest, no\nlong-term trends were observed. Overall, the effect of the seed bank on the\ntemporal variability of the vegetation in annual communities depends on site\nconditions and time scale. While the year-to-year variability of the seed bank\nis similar to the vegetation, the soil seed bank can buffer long-term trends.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Oct 2020 15:35:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-09"}

The reduction to a first order system applies\nboth to linear as well as quasilinear second order equations and we believe\nthis to be of independent interest. Using the first order system, we give a new\nrepresentation formula of the solution of the Dirichlet problem both on simply\nand finitely connected domains.

Key to the\nsuccess of vector quantization is deciding which parameter groups should be\ncompressed together.

The model that we\nconsider integrates boundary conditions that allow for full motion of the\ncontact points and angles. Equilibrium configurations consist of quiescent\nfluid within a domain whose upper boundary is given as the graph of a function\nminimizing a gravity-capillary energy functional, subject to a fixed mass\nconstraint. The equilibrium contact angles can take on any values between $0$\nand $\\pi$ depending on the choice of capillary parameters. The main thrust of\nthe paper is the development of a scheme of a priori estimates that show that\nsolutions emanating from data sufficiently close to the equilibrium exist\nglobally in time and decay to equilibrium at an exponential rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Oct 2020 15:56:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-30"}

We show that a\nsimple cubic model fits well with the atomic positions in the unit cell but\ncannot explain the observed anisotropy in the physical properties. The\ncooperative Jahn-Teller (JT) effect slightly violates the ideal metric of the\ncubic lattice and the symmetry of the electron density distribution in the\nlattice interstices. Theoretical models of the JT distortions of the boron\nframework are presented. Their correspondence to the electron-density\ndistribution on the maps of Fourier syntheses obtained using x-ray data and\nexplaining the previously observed anisotropy of conductive properties is\ndemonstrated. The effect of boron isotope composition on the character of the\nlattice distortions is shown. We also discuss the application of the Einstein\nmodel for cations and the Debye model for the boron atoms to describe the\ndynamics of the crystal lattice.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Oct 2020 12:59:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-13"}

This paper also introduces the precision\nrecall curve (PRC) as a supplemental metric that is more representative of LVAD\nclassifiers performance in predicting the minority class.\n  Background: In the LVAD domain, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC)\nis a commonly applied metric of performance of classifiers. However, ROC can\nprovide a distorted view of classifiers ability to predict short-term mortality\ndue to the overwhelmingly greater proportion of patients who survive, i.e.\nimbalanced data.\n  Methods: This study compared the ROC and PRC for the outcome of two\nclassifiers for 90-day LVAD mortality for 800 patients (test group) recorded in\nINTERMACS who received a continuous-flow LVAD between 2006 and 2016 (mean age\nof 59 years; 146 females vs. 654 males) in which mortality rate is only %8 at\n90-day (imbalanced data).

Moreover,\nneutrinos play key roles in supernovae, heating and reviving the shock wave as\nwell as cooling the resulting protoneutron star. Therefore, neutrino detectors\nare waiting to observe the next galactic supernova and several theoretical\nsimulations of supernova neutrinos are underway. While these simulation\nconcentrate mainly on only the first one second after the supernova bounce, the\nonly observation of a supernova with neutrinos, SN 1987A, revealed that\nneutrino emission lasts for more than 10 seconds. For this reason, long-time\nsimulation and analysis tools are needed to compare theories with the next\nobservation. Our study is to develop an integrated supernova analysis framework\nto prepare an analysis pipeline for treating galactic supernovae observations\nin the near future. This framework deals with the core-collapse, bounce and\nproto-neutron star cooling processes, as well as with neutrino detection on\nearth in a consistent manner. We have developed a new long-time supernova\nsimulation in one dimension that explodes successfully and computes the\nneutrino emission for up to 20 seconds.

As\nillustrated in Fig. 1 of the original article, a wave packet propagating\nthrough such a fast-light cloak is alleged to be able to reach the side behind\nthe cloaked object simultaneously with a corresponding wave packet propagating\nthrough the shorter, direct route in free space without the object, so that \"no\nshadow or waveform distortion arises.\" As the authors claim, the \"extra\npathlength is balanced out by the correspondingly larger group velocity of the\npulse in the cloak\", which allows to \"restore the incident field distribution\nall around the object in, both, amplitude and phase\". This fast-light effect\nmay be achieved in a broadband fashion using active (gain) materials. The\nauthors claim that such a fast-light cloak can hide an object, even from\ntime-of-flight detection techniques, and achieve invisibility \"over any desired\nfrequency band.\" We disagree with these claims and believe that a thorough\nclarification of the ideas put forward in the original article is important and\nnecessary for the broad wave-physics community. Specifically, in this comment\nwe clarify that invisibility cloaks based on fast-light media suffer from\nfundamental bandwidth restrictions that arise due to causality, the nature of\nsuperluminal wave propagation, and the stability issues of active systems.\nThese limitations and issues were not addressed in [Tsakmakidis, et al., Nat\nCommun 10 (2019)].

However,\nthe unique working mode of SNNs makes them more difficult to train than\ntraditional networks. Currently, there are two main routes to explore the\ntraining of deep SNNs with high performance. The first is to convert a\npre-trained ANN model to its SNN version, which usually requires a long coding\nwindow for convergence and cannot exploit the spatio-temporal features during\ntraining for solving temporal tasks. The other is to directly train SNNs in the\nspatio-temporal domain.

In this paper, we\nhave proposed and discussed the development of our software framework, \"Mobile\nTeleophthalomogy in Community Settings (mTOCS)\", that connects the community\npartners with eye-specialists and the Health Department staffs of respective\ncities to expedite this screening process. Moreover, we have presented the\nanalysis from our study on the acceptance of community-based screening methods\namong the community participants as well as on the effectiveness of mTOCS among\nthe community partners. The results have evinced that mTOCS has been capable of\nproviding an improved rate of eye-screenings and better health outcomes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Oct 2020 19:54:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-12"}

Specifically, we utilize the Casimir\noperator and the commutation relations of the generators of the $\\bar{E}(2)$\ngroup.

However, the construction of the\ngenerating vector of the rank-1 lattice is usually time-consuming because of an\nexhaustive computer search. To address this issue, we propose a simple\nclosed-form rank-1 lattice construction method based on group theory. Our\nmethod reduces the number of distinct pairwise distance values to generate a\nmore regular lattice. We theoretically prove a lower and an upper bound of the\nminimum pairwise distance of any non-degenerate rank-1 lattice. Empirically,\nour methods can generate a near-optimal rank-1 lattice compared with the\nKorobov exhaustive search regarding the $l_1$-norm and $l_2$-norm minimum\ndistance. Moreover, experimental results show that our method achieves superior\napproximation performance on benchmark integration test problems and kernel\napproximation problems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Oct 2020 03:42:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-13"}

The strong\nuser is allocated the maximum power, whereas the weak user is allocated the\nminimum power. This power allocation alters the decoding sequence along with\nthe signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR), at the users. The weak user\nbenefits from receiving multiple copies of the signal whereas the strong user\nbenefits from the higher power allocation. Numerical simulation results show\nthat the proposed scheme has a lower mutual outage probability (MOP) and offers\nbetter reliability as compared to the conventional power allocation scheme for\nCONOMA. An exact closed-form expression of MOP is derived for the two-user\nCO-NOMA system and it is shown that each user achieves full diversity. The\nproposed allocation is able to achieve approximately 30% higher transmission\nrate at 15 dB as compared to conventional CO-NOMA in a practical non-power\nbalanced scenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Oct 2020 16:48:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2020 19:13:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-26"}

These include: 1) the way in which\nmathematicians generate research programs, 2) the applicability of Bayesian\nmodels of mathematical heuristics, 3) the role of abductive reasoning in\nmathematics, 4) the way in which multiple proofs of a proposition can\nstrengthen our degree of belief in that proposition, and 5) the nature of the\nhypothesis that there are multiple formal systems that are isomorphic to\nphysically possible universes.
