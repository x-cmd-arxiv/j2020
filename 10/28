The quality of GAN results\nsignificantly degrades when testing images are from a slightly different\ndistribution. Moreover, recent work has shown that facial expressions can be\nsynthesized by changing localized face regions. In this work, we propose a\npixel-based facial expression synthesis method in which each output pixel\nobserves only one input pixel. The proposed method achieves good generalization\ncapability by leveraging only a few hundred training images. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that the proposed method performs comparably well against\nstate-of-the-art GANs on in-dataset images and significantly better on\nout-of-dataset images. In addition, the proposed model is two orders of\nmagnitude smaller which makes it suitable for deployment on\nresource-constrained devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 16:00:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-28"}

We demonstrate that the accuracy of\nPSFs is either on par or considerably better than that of conventional,\natom-centred SFs, with reductions in force prediction errors over a test set\napproaching 50% for certain organic molecules. Contrary to established\natom-centred SFs, computation of PSF does not involve any exponentials, and\ntheir intrinsic compact support supersedes use of separate cutoff functions.\nMost importantly, the number of floating point operations required to compute\npolynomial SFs introduced here is considerably lower than that of other SFs,\nenabling their efficient implementation without the need of highly optimised\ncode structures or caching, with speedups with respect to other\nstate-of-the-art SFs reaching a factor of 4.5 to 5. This low-effort performance\nbenefit substantially simplifies their use in new programs and emerging\nplatforms such as graphical processing units (GPU). Overall, polynomial SFs\nwith compact support improve accuracy of both, energy and force predictions\nwith HDNNPs while enabling significant speedups with respect to their\nwell-established counterparts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 16:23:49 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 2021 11:19:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 1 Feb 2021 16:41:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-02"}

In such solutions, the cloud\nstorage is trusted for data availability, but not for confidentiality.\nAdditionally, the user's device is considered secure, and the user is expected\nto behave correctly.\n  We argue that such assumptions are not met in reality: e.g., users routinely\nforget passwords and fail to make backups, and users' devices get stolen or\nbecome infected with malware. Therefore, we consider a more extensive threat\nmodel, where users' devices are susceptible to attacks and common human errors\nare possible. Given this model, we analyze 10 popular commercial services and\nshow that none of them provides good confidentiality and data availability.\n  Motivated by the lack of adequate solutions in the market, we design a novel\nscheme called Two-Factor Encryption (2FE) that draws inspiration from\ntwo-factor authentication and turns file encryption and decryption into an\ninteractive process where two user devices, like a laptop and a smartphone,\nmust interact. 2FE provides strong confidentiality and availability guarantees,\nas it withstands compromised cloud storage, one stolen or compromised user\ndevice at a time, and various human errors. 2FE achieves this by leveraging\nsecret sharing with additional techniques such as oblivious pseudorandom\nfunctions and zero-knowledge proofs.

We propose and demonstrate the\ndeterministic implementation of a multi-mode set of measurement-induced quantum\ngates in a large two-dimensional (2D) optical cluster state using\nphase-controlled continuous variable quadrature measurements.

Using these programmable gates, we demonstrate a small quantum\ncircuit consisting of 10 single-mode gates and 2 two-mode gates on a three-mode\ninput state. On this platform, fault-tolerant universal quantum computing is\npossible if the cluster state entanglement is improved and a supply of\nGottesman-Kitaev-Preskill qubits is available.

In this paper, we revisit a simple, plausible explanation to account\nfor the eccentricities of warm Jupiters: migration inside a cavity in the\nprotoplanetary disc. Such a scenario allows to excite the outer eccentric\nresonances, a working mechanism for higher mass planets, leading to a growth in\nthe eccentricity while preventing other, closer resonances to damp\neccentricity. We test this idea with diverse numerical simulations, which show\nthat the eccentricity of a Jupiter-mass planet around a Sun-like star can\nincrease up to 0.4, a value never reached before with solely planet--disc\ninteractions. This high eccentricity is comparable to, if not larger than, the\nmedian eccentricity of warm Saturn- to Jupiter-mass exoplanets.

As a yardstick we take Wilke's\nalternating tree automata, which we shall call parity formulas in the text.\nBuilding on work by Bruse, Friedmann & Lange, we compare two size measures for\n$\\mu$-calculus formulas: subformula-size,i.e. , the number of subformulas of\nthe given formula, and closure-size. These notions correspond to the\nrepresentation of a formula as a parity formula based on, respectively, its\nsubformula dag, and its closure graph. What distinguishes our approach is that\nwe are explicit about the role of alpha-equivalence, as naively renaming bound\nvariables can lead to an exponential blow-up. In addition, we match the\nformula's alternation depth with the index of the parity formula. We start in a\nsetting without alpha-equivalence. We define subformula-size and closure-size\nand recall that a $\\mu$-calculus formula can be transformed into a parity\nformula of size linear wrt subformula size, and give a construction that\ntransforms a $\\mu$-calculus formula into an equivalent parity formula linear\nwrt closure-size. Conversely, there is a standard transformation producing a\n$\\mu$-calculus formula of exponential subformula -- but linear closure-size in\nterms of the size of the original parity formula. We identify so-called\nuntwisted parity formulas for which a transformation linear in subformula-size\nexists. We then introduce size notions that are completely invariant under\nalpha equivalence. We transfer the result of Bruse et alii, showing that also\nin our setting closure-size can be exponentially smaller than subformula-size.\nWe also show how to rename bound variables so that alpha-equivalence becomes\nsyntactic identity on the closure set.

The starting point of the analysis is a generic Hamiltonian\nconstraint where free functions of the triad and curvature components as well\nas non-minimal couplings between geometric and matter degrees of freedom are\nconsidered. Then, the requirement of anomaly freedom is imposed in order to\nobtain a modified Hamiltonian that forms a first-class algebra.

The experimental force profiles are considered as a\nsuperposition of double layer and structural forces. In order to independently\ndescribe the decay of the double layer force, the ionic strength of the\nsuspension is determined by electrolytic conductivity measurements. Jellium\napproximation is used to define the impact of the fluid on screening the\nsurface potential. There, the nanoparticles are considered homogeneously\ndistributed across the fluid and screening is only carried out via the\nparticles counterions and added salt.

Clone algebras are defined by true\nidentities and thus form a variety in the sense of universal algebra. The most\nnatural clone algebras, the ones the axioms are intended to characterise, are\nalgebras of functions, called functional clone algebras. The universe of a\nfunctional clone algebra, called omega-clone, is a set of infinitary operations\ncontaining the projections and closed under finitary compositions. We show that\nthere exists a bijective correspondence between clones (of finitary operations)\nand a suitable subclass of functional clone algebras, called block algebras.\nGiven a clone, the corresponding block algebra is obtained by extending the\noperations of the clone by countably many dummy arguments.\n  One of the main results of this paper is the general representation theorem,\nwhere it is shown that every clone algebra is isomorphic to a functional clone\nalgebra. In another result of the paper we prove that the variety of clone\nalgebras is generated by the class of block algebras. This implies that every\nomega-clone is algebraically generated by a suitable family of clones by using\ndirect products, subalgebras and homomorphic images.\n  We conclude the paper with two applications. In the first one, we use clone\nalgebras to answer a classical question about the lattices of equational\ntheories. The second application is to the study of the category VAR of all\nvarieties. We introduce the category CA of all clone algebras (of arbitrary\nsimilarity type) with pure homomorphisms as arrows. We show that the category\nVAR is categorically isomorphic to a full subcategory of CA.

Therefore, we obtain a general approximate solution of a\nmagnetically dominated jet/wind, which covers from the nonrelativistic to\nrelativistic regimes, with the drift velocity well matching the cold plasma\nvelocity. The acceleration of a jet includes three stages. (1) The jet flow is\nlocated within the Alfv\\'{e}n critical surface (i.e. the light cylinder), has a\nnonrelativistic speed, and is dominated by toroidal motion.

Palaeography - the study of ancient handwriting - can provide access\nto this scribal culture. However, one of the problems of traditional\npalaeography is to determine writer identity when the writing style is near\nuniform. This is exemplified by the Great Isaiah Scroll (1QIsaa). To this end,\nwe used pattern recognition and artificial intelligence techniques to innovate\nthe palaeography of the scrolls regarding writer identification and to pioneer\nthe microlevel of individual scribes to open access to the Bible's ancient\nscribal culture. Although many scholars believe that 1QIsaa was written by one\nscribe, we report new evidence for a breaking point in the series of columns in\nthis scroll. Without prior assumption of writer identity, based on point clouds\nof the reduced-dimensionality feature-space, we found that columns from the\nfirst and second halves of the manuscript ended up in two distinct zones of\nsuch scatter plots, notably for a range of digital palaeography tools, each\naddressing very different featural aspects of the script samples. In a\nsecondary, independent, analysis, now assuming writer difference and using yet\nanother independent feature method and several different types of statistical\ntesting, a switching point was found in the column series. A clear phase\ntransition is apparent around column 27. Given the statistically significant\ndifferences between the two halves, a tertiary, post-hoc analysis was\nperformed. Demonstrating that two main scribes were responsible for the Great\nIsaiah Scroll, this study sheds new light on the Bible's ancient scribal\nculture by providing new, tangible evidence that ancient biblical texts were\nnot copied by a single scribe only but that multiple scribes could closely\ncollaborate on one particular manuscript.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 17:36:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-29"}

We show that we\ncan easily convert a standard architecture for unidirectional decoding into a\nbidirectional decoder by simply interleaving the two directions and adapting\nthe word positions and self-attention masks.

To achieve even higher speedups, we explore hybrid models where we\neither simultaneously predict multiple neighbouring tokens per direction, or\nperform multi-directional decoding by partitioning the target sequence.

However, this may be infeasible\nin practical situations, either because making perturbations is not possible,\nor because it is unclear how to choose suitable perturbation strategies without\nsacrificing performance. The key insight of this work is that learning diverse\nbehaviors for accomplishing a task can directly lead to behavior that\ngeneralizes to varying environments, without needing to perform explicit\nperturbations during training. By identifying multiple solutions for the task\nin a single environment during training, our approach can generalize to new\nsituations by abandoning solutions that are no longer effective and adopting\nthose that are.

Agents\ncommunicate according to a time-varying model in which edges of an underlying\nconnected graph are active at each iteration with certain non-uniform\nprobabilities. By relying on a primal decomposition scheme applied to an\nequivalent problem reformulation, we propose a novel distributed algorithm in\nwhich agents negotiate a local allocation of the total resource only with\nneighbors with active communication links. The algorithm is studied as a\nsubgradient method with block-wise updates, in which blocks correspond to the\ngraph edges that are active at each iteration.

Since the amount of robot data we can collect for any single\ntask is limited by time and cost considerations, the learned behavior is\ntypically narrow: the policy can only execute the task in a handful of\nscenarios that it was trained on. What if there was a way to incorporate a\nlarge amount of prior data, either from previously solved tasks or from\nunsupervised or undirected environment interaction, to extend and generalize\nlearned behaviors? While most prior work on extending robotic skills using\npre-collected data focuses on building explicit hierarchies or skill\ndecompositions, we show in this paper that we can reuse prior data to extend\nnew skills simply through dynamic programming. We show that even when the prior\ndata does not actually succeed at solving the new task, it can still be\nutilized for learning a better policy, by providing the agent with a broader\nunderstanding of the mechanics of its environment. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our approach by chaining together several behaviors seen in\nprior datasets for solving a new task, with our hardest experimental setting\ninvolving composing four robotic skills in a row: picking, placing, drawer\nopening, and grasping, where a +1/0 sparse reward is provided only on task\ncompletion.

Recent results on quantum complexity\nprovide additional support to the type of global protocols used to prove that\nwithin ordinary -- unitary -- quantum mechanics no definite event -- an outcome\nto which a probability can be associated -- occurs. In lieu of this, states\nthat start in a coherent superposition of possible outcomes always remain as a\nsuperposition. We show that, if one takes into account fundamental inescapable\nuncertainties in measuring length and time intervals due to general relativity\nand quantum mechanics, the previously mentioned global protocols no longer\nallow to distinguish whether the state is in a superposition or not. One is\nleft with a formulation of quantum mechanics purely defined in quantum\nmechanical terms without any reference to the classical world and with an\nintrinsic operational definition of quantum events that does not need external\nobservers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 18:00:01 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2020 15:09:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-15"}

Focusing on the local model of PNG,\nparameterized by $f_{\\rm NL}$, we perform a Monte-Carlo Markov Chain analysis\nto confront perturbation theory predictions of the halo power spectrum and\nbispectrum in real space against a suite of N-body simulations. We model the\nhalo bispectrum at tree-level, including all contributions linear and quadratic\nin $f_{\\rm NL}$, and the halo power spectrum at 1-loop, including tree-level\nterms up to quadratic order in $f_{\\rm NL}$ and all loops induced by local PNG\nlinear in $f_{\\rm NL}$. Keeping the cosmological parameters fixed, we examine\nthe effect of informative priors on the linear non-Gaussian bias parameter on\nthe statistical inference of $f_{\\rm NL}$. A conservative analysisof the\ncombined power spectrum and bispectrum, in which only loose priors are imposed\nand all parameters are marginalized over, can improve the constraint on $f_{\\rm\nNL}$ by more than a factor of 5 relative to the power spectrum-only\nmeasurement.

Narrow passages induce a higher runtime, because the chance to sample\nthem becomes vanishingly small. In recent work, we showed that narrow passages\ncan be approached by relaxing the problem using admissible lower-dimensional\nprojections of the state space. Those relaxations often increase the volume of\nnarrow passages under projection. Solving the relaxed problem is often\nefficient and produces an admissible heuristic we can exploit. However, given a\nbase path, i.e. a solution to a relaxed problem, there are currently no\ntailored methods to efficiently exploit the base path. To efficiently exploit\nthe base path and thereby its admissible heuristic, we develop section\npatterns, which are solution strategies to efficiently exploit base paths in\nparticular around narrow passages. To coordinate section patterns, we develop\nthe pattern dance algorithm, which efficiently coordinates section patterns to\nreactively traverse narrow passages. We combine the pattern dance algorithm\nwith previously developed multilevel planning algorithms and benchmark them on\nchallenging planning problems like the Bugtrap, the double L-shape, an egress\nproblem and on four pregrasp scenarios for a 37 degrees of freedom shadow hand\nmounted on a KUKA LWR robot.

By\nimposing a false-alarm-rate threshold of two per year in each of the four\nsearch pipelines that constitute our search, we present 39 candidate\ngravitational wave events. At this threshold, we expect a contamination\nfraction of less than 10%. Of these, 26 candidate events were reported\npreviously in near real-time through GCN Notices and Circulars; 13 are reported\nhere for the first time. The catalog contains events whose sources are black\nhole binary mergers up to a redshift of ~0.8, as well as events whose\ncomponents could not be unambiguously identified as black holes or neutron\nstars. For the latter group, we are unable to determine the nature based on\nestimates of the component masses and spins from gravitational wave data alone.\nThe range of candidate events which are unambiguously identified as binary\nblack holes (both objects $\\geq 3~M_\\odot$) is increased compared to GWTC-1,\nwith total masses from $\\sim 14~M_\\odot$ for GW190924_021846 to $\\sim\n150~M_\\odot$ for GW190521. For the first time, this catalog includes binary\nsystems with significantly asymmetric mass ratios, which had not been observed\nin data taken before April 2019. We also find that 11 of the 39 events detected\nsince April 2019 have positive effective inspiral spins under our default prior\n(at 90% credibility), while none exhibit negative effective inspiral spin.\nGiven the increased sensitivity of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo, the\ndetection of 39 candidate events in ~26 weeks of data (~1.5 per week) is\nconsistent with GWTC-1.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 18:01:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Feb 2021 16:31:07 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 8 Mar 2021 18:36:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-15"}

Using events detected by LIGO-Virgo up to 1\nOctober 2019, we evaluate the consistency of the data with predictions from the\ntheory. We first establish that residuals from the best-fit waveform are\nconsistent with detector noise, and that the low- and high-frequency parts of\nthe signals are in agreement. We then consider parametrized modifications to\nthe waveform by varying post-Newtonian and phenomenological coefficients,\nimproving past constraints by factors of ${\\sim}2$; we also find consistency\nwith Kerr black holes when we specifically target signatures of the\nspin-induced quadrupole moment. Looking for gravitational-wave dispersion, we\ntighten constraints on Lorentz-violating coefficients by a factor of\n${\\sim}2.6$ and bound the mass of the graviton to $m_g \\leq 1.76 \\times\n10^{-23} \\mathrm{eV}/c^2$ with 90% credibility. We also analyze the properties\nof the merger remnants by measuring ringdown frequencies and damping times,\nconstraining fractional deviations away from the Kerr frequency to $\\delta\n\\hat{f}_{220} = 0.03^{+0.38}_{-0.35}$ for the fundamental quadrupolar mode, and\n$\\delta \\hat{f}_{221} = 0.04^{+0.27}_{-0.32}$ for the first overtone;\nadditionally, we find no evidence for postmerger echoes. Finally, we determine\nthat our data are consistent with tensorial polarizations through a\ntemplate-independent method. When possible, we assess the validity of general\nrelativity based on collections of events analyzed jointly. We find no evidence\nfor new physics beyond general relativity, for black hole mimickers, or for any\nunaccounted systematics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 18:01:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 16 Jun 2021 04:11:18 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-17"}

This\ninformation is key to understand the effect on the gamma-ray absorption due to\neither extragalactic background light and/or intrinsic absorption and emission\nprocesses. All this information has also an impact on the determination of the\nlocation of the emitting region within the relativistic jets. In this work a\nnew optical spectroscopic characterization is presented for three gamma-ray\nblazars: S4 0954+65, TXS 1515-273 and RX J0812.0+0237. For all the three\ntargets the redshift determination is successful, and for the first time in the\ncase of TXS 1515-273 and RX J0812.0+0237. Their classification as BL~Lac type\nis confirmed based on these new optical spectra. For S4 0954+65\n(z=$0.3694\\pm0.0011$) an estimation on the disk, broad line region and torus\nluminosities is performed based on the observed optical emission lines. The\nresults from this study are compatible with the nature of S4 0954+65 as a\ntransitional blazar. In the case of TXS 1515-273 ($z=0.1281\\pm 0.0004$),\nalthough its optical spectrum is dominated by the continuum emission from the\njet, applying the pPXF technique, the stellar population can be unveiled and is\ncompatible with an old and metallic population. It is also the case of RX\nJ0812.0+0237 ($z=0.1721\\pm 0.0002$). Moreover, this work confirms that the\noptical spectrum from RX J0812.0+0237 is compatible with an extreme blazar\nclassification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 18:05:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 22 Apr 2021 19:14:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-12"}

We observe several characteristics of the merging binary black\nhole (BBH) population not discernible until now. First, we find that the\nprimary mass spectrum contains structure beyond a power-law with a sharp\nhigh-mass cut-off; it is more consistent with a broken power law with a break\nat $39.7^{+20.3}_{-9.1}\\,M_\\odot$, or a power law with a Gaussian feature\npeaking at $33.1^{+4.0}_{-5.6}\\,M_\\odot$ (90\\% credible interval). While the\nprimary mass distribution must extend to $\\sim65\\,M_\\odot$ or beyond, only\n$2.9^{+3.5}_{1.7}\\%$ of systems have primary masses greater than $45\\,M_\\odot$.\nSecond, we find that a fraction of BBH systems have component spins misaligned\nwith the orbital angular momentum, giving rise to precession of the orbital\nplane. Moreover, 12% to 44% of BBH systems have spins tilted by more than\n$90^\\circ$, giving rise to a negative effective inspiral spin parameter\n$\\chi_\\mathrm{eff}$. Under the assumption that such systems can only be formed\nby dynamical interactions, we infer that between 25% and 93% of BBH with\nnon-vanishing $|\\chi_\\mathrm{eff}| > 0.01$ are dynamically assembled. Third, we\nestimate merger rates, finding $\\mathcal{R}_\\text{BBH} = 23.9^{+14.3}_{8.6}$\nGpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ for BBH and $\\mathcal{R}_\\text{BNS}= 320^{+490}_{-240}$\nGpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ for binary neutron stars. We find that the BBH rate likely\nincreases with redshift ($85\\%$ credibility), but not faster than the\nstar-formation rate ($86\\%$ credibility). Additionally, we examine recent\nexceptional events in the context of our population models, finding that the\nasymmetric masses of GW190412 and the high component masses of GW190521 are\nconsistent with our models, but the low secondary mass of GW190814 makes it an\noutlier.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 18:05:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 2021 19:28:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-16"}

However, this type of assertions is not\neasy to comprehend by programmers that are used to formal specifications in\nstandard first-order logic. In this paper, we present an approach to verify GP\n2 programs with a standard first-order logic. We show how to construct a\nstrongest liberal postcondition with respect to a rule schema and a\nprecondition. We then extend this construction to obtain strongest liberal\npostconditions for arbitrary loop-free programs. Compared with previous work,\nthis allows to reason about a vastly generalised class of graph programs. In\nparticular, many programs with nested loops can be verified with the new\ncalculus.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 18:38:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2020 02:27:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-04"}

Bertozzi and Flenner\n(2012) pioneered the use of this differential equation as a method for graph\nclassification problems, such as semi-supervised learning and image\nsegmentation. In Merkurjev, Kosti\\'c, and Bertozzi (2013), a\nMerriman-Bence-Osher (MBO) scheme with fidelity forcing was used instead, as\nthe MBO scheme is heuristically similar to the ACE. This paper rigorously\nestablishes the graph MBO scheme with fidelity forcing as a special case of an\nSDIE scheme for the graph ACE with fidelity forcing. This connection requires\nusing the double-obstacle potential in the ACE, as was shown in Budd and Van\nGennip (2020) for ACE without fidelity forcing. We also prove that solutions of\nthe SDIE scheme converge to solutions of the graph ACE with fidelity forcing as\nthe SDIE time step tends to zero.\n  Next, we develop the SDIE scheme as a classification algorithm. We also\nintroduce some innovations into the algorithms for the SDIE and MBO schemes.\nFor large graphs, we use a QR decomposition method to compute an\neigendecomposition from a Nystr\\\"om extension, which outperforms the method\nused in e.g. Bertozzi and Flenner (2012) in accuracy, stability, and speed.\nMoreover, we replace the Euler discretisation for the scheme's diffusion step\nby a computation based on the Strang formula for matrix exponentials. We apply\nthis algorithm to a number of image segmentation problems, and compare the\nperformance of the SDIE and MBO schemes. We find that whilst the general SDIE\nscheme does not perform better than the MBO special case at this task, our\nother innovations lead to a significantly better segmentation than that from\nprevious literature.

Transition-based parsers build trees by executing actions in a state\ntransition system. They are computationally efficient, and can leverage machine\nlearning to predict actions based on partial trees. However, existing\ntransition-based parsers are predominantly based on the shift-reduce transition\nsystem, which does not align with how humans are known to parse sentences.\nPsycholinguistic research suggests that human parsing is strongly incremental:\nhumans grow a single parse tree by adding exactly one token at each step. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel transition system called attach-juxtapose. It is\nstrongly incremental; it represents a partial sentence using a single tree;\neach action adds exactly one token into the partial tree. Based on our\ntransition system, we develop a strongly incremental parser. At each step, it\nencodes the partial tree using a graph neural network and predicts an action.\nWe evaluate our parser on Penn Treebank (PTB) and Chinese Treebank (CTB). On\nPTB, it outperforms existing parsers trained with only constituency trees; and\nit performs on par with state-of-the-art parsers that use dependency trees as\nadditional training data. On CTB, our parser establishes a new state of the\nart.

It is critical\nfor eCommerce search engines to showcase in the top results the variety and\nselection of inventory available, specifically in the context of the various\nbuying intents that may be associated with a search query. Search rankers are\nmost commonly powered by learning-to-rank models which learn the preference\nbetween items during training. However, they score items independent of other\nitems at runtime. Although the items placed at top of the results by such\nscoring functions may be independently optimal, they can be sub-optimal as a\nset. This may lead to a mismatch between the ideal distribution of items in the\ntop results vs what is actually impressed. In this paper, we present methods to\naddress the purchase-impression gap observed in top search results on eCommerce\nsites. We establish the ideal distribution of items based on historic shopping\npatterns. We then present a sequential reranker that methodically reranks top\nsearch results produced by a conventional pointwise scoring ranker. The\nreranker produces a reordered list by sequentially selecting candidates trading\noff between their independent relevance and potential to address the\npurchase-impression gap by utilizing specially constructed features that\ncapture impression distribution of items already added to a reranked list. The\nsequential reranker enables addressing purchase impression gap with respect to\nmultiple item aspects. Early version of the reranker showed promising lifts in\nconversion and engagement metrics at eBay. Based on experiments on randomly\nsampled validation datasets, we observe that the reranking methodology\npresented produces around 10% reduction in purchase-impression gap at an\naverage for the top 20 results, while making improvements to conversion\nmetrics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 19:26:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-29"}

Agents\ninteract as in the Deffuant model, with a parameter $\\alpha$ controlling the\npersuasibility of the individuals. The interaction coincides with the collision\nrule of two grains moving on a line, provided opinions and velocities are\nidentified, with $\\alpha$ being the so-called coefficient of normal\nrestitution. Starting from the master equation of the probability density of\nall opinions, general conditions are given for the system to reach consensus.\nThe case when the interaction frequency is proportional to the $\\beta$-power of\nthe relative opinions is studied in more detail. It is shown that the\nmean-field approximation to the master equation leads to the Boltzmann kinetic\nequation for the opinion distribution. In this case, the system always\napproaches consensus, which can be seen as the approach to zero of the opinion\ntemperature, a measure of the width of the opinion distribution. Moreover, the\nlong-time behaviour of the system is characterized by a scaling solution to the\nBoltzmann equation in which all time dependence occurs through the temperature.\nThe case $\\beta=0$ is related to the Deffuant model and is analytically\nsoluble. The scaling distribution is unimodal and independent of $\\alpha$. For\n$\\beta>0$ the distribution of opinions is unimodal below a critical value of\n$|\\alpha|$, being multimodal with two maxima above it. This means that agents\nmay approach consensus while being polarized. Near the critical points and for\n$|\\alpha|\\ge 0.4$, the distribution of opinions is well approximated by the sum\nof two Gaussian distributions.

We empirically study this form of safety-constrained transfer learning\nin three challenging domains: simulated navigation, quadruped locomotion, and\ndexterous in-hand manipulation. In comparison to standard deep RL techniques\nand prior approaches to safe RL, we find that our method enables the learning\nof new tasks and in new environments with both substantially fewer safety\nincidents, such as falling or dropping an object, and faster, more stable\nlearning. This suggests a path forward not only for safer RL systems, but also\nfor more effective RL systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 20:53:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-29"}

To improve dynamical seasonal forecast, it\nis crucial to set up forecast benchmarks, and clarify forecast limitations\nposed by model initialization errors, formulation deficiencies, and internal\nclimate variability. With huge cost in generating large forecast ensembles, and\nlimited observations for forecast verification, the seasonal forecast\nbenchmarking and diagnosing task proves challenging. In this study, we develop\na probabilistic deep neural network model, drawing on a wealth of existing\nclimate simulations to enhance seasonal forecast capability and forecast\ndiagnosis. By leveraging complex physical relationships encoded in climate\nsimulations, our probabilistic forecast model demonstrates favorable\ndeterministic and probabilistic skill compared to state-of-the-art dynamical\nforecast systems in quasi-global seasonal forecast of precipitation and\nnear-surface temperature. We apply this probabilistic forecast methodology to\nquantify the impacts of initialization errors and model formulation\ndeficiencies in a dynamical seasonal forecasting system. We introduce the\nsaliency analysis approach to efficiently identify the key predictors that\ninfluence seasonal variability. Furthermore, by explicitly modeling uncertainty\nusing variational Bayes, we give a more definitive answer to how the El\nNino/Southern Oscillation, the dominant mode of seasonal variability, modulates\nglobal seasonal predictability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 21:02:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-29"}

While many models of plasticity\nexist, the precise relationship between plastic dynamics and the structure of a\nparticle's local environment remains an open question. Previously, machine\nlearning was used to identify a structural predictor of rearrangements, called\n\"softness.\" Although softness has been shown to predict which particles will\nrearrange with high accuracy, the method can be difficult to implement in\nexperiments where data is limited and the combinations of descriptors it\nidentifies are often difficult to interpret physically. Here we address both of\nthese weaknesses, presenting two major improvements to the standard softness\nmethod. First, we present a natural representation of each particle's observed\nmobility, allowing for the use of statistical models which are both simpler and\nprovide greater accuracy in limited data sets. Second, we employ persistent\nhomology as a systematic means of identifying simple, topologically-informed,\nstructural quantities that are easy to interpret and measure experimentally. We\ntest our methods on two-dimensional athermal packings of soft spheres under\nquasi-static shear. We find that the same structural information which predicts\nsmall variations in the response is also predictive of where plastic events\nwill localize. We also find that excellent accuracy is achieved in athermal\nsheared packings using simply a particle's species and the number of nearest\nneighbor contacts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 21:55:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-29"}

In single-query feasible motion\nplanning, using bidirectional search to find a continuous motion plan requires\nan edge connection between the forward and reverse search trees.

We present a novel bidirectional search strategy that does\nnot require solving the two-point BVP. Instead of connecting the forward and\nreverse trees directly, the reverse tree's cost information is used as a\nguiding heuristic for the forward search. This enables the forward search to\nquickly converge to a feasible solution without solving the two-point BVP.

However, among the many suspected modules, it has been difficult to\nfind the one with the fault. To find such a faulty module more easily, the\ntriggered scaler module, which was designed as a PLC-type I/O module, was\ndeveloped. This type of module requires the start signal of the J-PARC main\nring (MR) slow cycle (2.48/5.20 s) and the start signal of the rapid cycle (25\nHz) as reference signals, which are generated by the J-PARC timing system.

In 2018, the module was evaluated using the\ntrigger for injection kicker and the low-level radio frequency (LLRF) signal of\nJ-PARC MR. The expected results were shown. In 2020, two applications were\ndeveloped based on a triggered scaler module.

For the description of hadronic matter, we will use different\nparametrizations of the relativistic mean field model with density-dependent\ncoupling constants. For the description of quark matter we will use an\neffective nonlocal Nambu Jona-Lasinio model of three flavors with vector\ninteractions, in which we will include the possibility of formation of diquarks\nto model a superconducting phase of color in $SU(3)$.

The simplified thermal evolution of compact stars during their\nformation is studied, from their state of proto-neutron stars to that of cold\nneutron stars, and the results obtained are compared with recent astrophysical\nobservations. The results obtained indicate that the occurrence of quark matter\nin the nuclei of these stars remains a promising possibility. The fact that the\nuse of more realistic models for the description of the dense matter in these\nobjects indicates the presence of quark matter inside neutron stars, could be\nan answer to the question of the behavior of that kind of matter and the\ndetermination of its corresponding equation of state.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Oct 2020 03:29:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-29"}

The EAR generates an intermediate volume between\nthe saturated liquid and vapor volumes. The trajectory of the intermediate\nvolume over the coexistence region is defined here as the Maxwell crossover,\ndenoted as the M-line, which is independent of EoS. For the vdW or any cubic[3]\nEoS, the intermediate volume corresponds to the unphysical root, while other\ntwo corresponding to the saturated volumes of vapor and liquid phases,\nrespectively. Due to its unphysical nature, the intermediate volume has always\nbeen discarded. Here we show that the M-line, which turns out to be strictly\nrelated to the diameter[4] of the coexistence curve, holds the key to solving\nseveral major issues. Traditionally the coexistence curve with two branches is\nconsidered as the extension of the Widom line[5,6-9]. This assertion causes an\ninconsistency in three planes of temperature, pressure and volume.

For 55 kinds of frequent daily activities of the elders, ElderSim\ngenerates realistic motions of synthetic characters with various adjustable\ndata-generating options, and provides different output modalities including RGB\nvideos, two- and three-dimensional skeleton trajectories. We then generate KIST\nSynADL, a large-scale synthetic dataset of elders' activities of daily living,\nfrom ElderSim and use the data in addition to real datasets to train three\nstate-of the-art human action recognition models. From the experiments\nfollowing several newly proposed scenarios that assume different real and\nsynthetic dataset configurations for training, we observe a noticeable\nperformance improvement by augmenting our synthetic data. We also offer\nguidance with insights for the effective utilization of synthetic data to help\nrecognize elders' daily activities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Oct 2020 04:27:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-22"}

Here we investigate whether close-in super-Earths and mini-Neptunes\nforming in situ can lock into resonant chains due to dissipation from a\ndepleted gas disk. We simulate the giant impact phase of planet formation,\nincluding eccentricity damping from a gaseous disk, followed by subsequent\ndynamical evolution over tens of millions of years. In a fraction of simulated\nsystems, we find that planets naturally lock into resonant chains. These\nplanets achieve a chain of near-integer period ratios during the gas disk\nstage, experience eccentricity damping that captures them into resonance, stay\nin resonance as the gas disk dissipates, and avoid subsequent giant impacts,\neccentricity excitation, and chaotic diffusion that would dislodge the planets\nfrom resonance. Disk conditions that enable planets to complete their formation\nduring the gas disk stage enable those planets to achieve tight period ratios\n<= 2 and, if they happen to be near integer period ratios, lock into resonance.\nUsing the weighting of different disk conditions deduced by MacDonald et al.\n(2020) and forward modeling Kepler selection effects, we find that our\nsimulations of in situ formation via oligarchic growth lead to a rate of\nobservable trios with integer period ratios and librating resonant angles\ncomparable to observed Kepler systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Oct 2020 04:28:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-09"}

Each user in EBT first sends pilot signals through\nmultiple channels that are initially allocated by a base station (BS) for\nexploration, and then the BS informs a subset of initially allocated channels\nthat are associated with high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) for data packet\ntransmission by the user while releasing the rest of the channels for other\nusers. Consequently, EBT exploits a multichannel selection diversity gain\nduring data packet transmission, at the cost of exploration during pilot\ntransmission.

However, the great potential of\nsuch solutions have yet to be unleashed due to the challenge of simultaneously\nexploring the vast and entangled, yet different design spaces of the networks\nand their accelerators. To this end, we propose DNA, a Differentiable\nNetwork-Accelerator co-search framework for automatically searching for matched\nnetworks and accelerators to maximize both the task accuracy and acceleration\nefficiency. Specifically, DNA integrates two enablers: (1) a generic design\nspace for DNN accelerators that is applicable to both FPGA- and ASIC-based DNN\naccelerators and compatible with DNN frameworks such as PyTorch to enable\nalgorithmic exploration for more efficient DNNs and their accelerators; and (2)\na joint DNN network and accelerator co-search algorithm that enables\nsimultaneously searching for optimal DNN structures and their accelerators'\nmicro-architectures and mapping methods to maximize both the task accuracy and\nacceleration efficiency. Experiments and ablation studies based on FPGA\nmeasurements and ASIC synthesis show that the matched networks and accelerators\ngenerated by DNA consistently outperform state-of-the-art (SOTA) DNNs and DNN\naccelerators (e.g., 3.04x better FPS with a 5.46% higher accuracy on ImageNet),\nwhile requiring notably reduced search time (up to 1234.3x) over SOTA\nco-exploration methods, when evaluated over ten SOTA baselines on three\ndatasets.

Nevertheless, due to the continuous\ndeparture of existing nodes and the arrival of newcomers, the missing cached\ndata may lead to permanent data loss. In this study, we propose and analyze a\nclass of LDPC codes for distributed data caching in cellular networks.

To\nassess the versatility of LDPC codes and establish performance comparisons to\nclassic coding techniques, novel theoretical and experimental evaluations are\nderived. Essentially, the theoretical/numerical results for repair bandwidth\ncost in presence of BS are presented in a distributed caching setting.\nAccordingly, when the gap between the cost of downloading a symbol from BS and\nfrom other local network nodes is not dramatically high, we demonstrate that\nLDPC codes can be considered as a viable fault-tolerance alternative in\ncellular systems with caching capabilities for both low and high code rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Oct 2020 06:09:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2020 09:36:43 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 1 Oct 2021 11:58:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-04"}

The model is decoupled\ninto two parts: audio-to-phoneme (A2P) network and phoneme-to-text (P2T)\nnetwork. The A2P network can learn acoustic pattern scenarios using large-scale\nmonolingual paired data. Meanwhile, it generates multiple phoneme sequence\ncandidates for single audio data in real-time during the training process.

We introduce here a general framework to study and avoid the\neffect of disorder. We experimentally find an almost complete set of optical\nchannels that are resilient to disorder induced by strong deformations. These\ndeformation principle modes are obtained by only exploiting measurements for\nweak perturbations. We explain this effect by demonstrating that, even for a\nhigh level of disorder, the propagation of light in MMFs can be characterized\nby just a few key properties. These results are made possible thanks to a\nprecise and fast estimation of the modal transmission matrix of the fiber which\nrelies on a model-based optimization using deep learning frameworks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Oct 2020 08:38:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Jun 2021 18:10:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-30"}

Some of these theories predict the existence of a\nnon-linear phenomenon, spontaneous scalarisation, which can lead to the\nappearance of sizeable modifications to general relativity in the presence of\ncompact matter distributions, namely neutron stars. On the one hand, one of the\neffects of the scalar field is to modify the emission of gravitational waves,\nboth due to variations in the quadrupolar deformation of the star and to the\npresence of additional modes of emission. On the other hand, neutron stars are\nknown to harbour extremely powerful magnetic fields which can affect their\nstructure and shape, leading in turn to the emission of gravitational waves,\nthis time due to a magnetic quadrupolar deformation. We investigate here how\nthe presence of spontaneous scalarisation can affect the magnetic deformation\nof neutron stars and their emission of quadrupolar gravitational waves, both of\ntensor and scalar nature. We will show that it is possible to provide simple\nparameterisations of the magnetic deformation and gravitational wave power of\nneutron stars in terms of their baryonic mass, circumferential radius and\nscalar charge, and that a universal scaling exists independently of the\nmagnetic field geometry and of the parameters of the scalar-tensor theory.\nFinally, we comment on the observability of the deviations of the gravitational\nwaves strain from general relativity by current and future observatories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Oct 2020 09:14:42 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 9 Nov 2020 14:47:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-06"}

However, this\nmechanism has never been employed for the optical flow task. This is mainly due\nto the significantly increased search dimension in the case of optical flow\ncomputation, ie, a straightforward extension would require dense 4D\nconvolutions in order to process a 5D feature volume, which is computationally\nprohibitive. This paper proposes a novel solution that is able to bypass the\nrequirement of building a 5D feature volume while still allowing the network to\nlearn suitable matching costs from data. Our key innovation is to decouple the\nconnection between 2D displacements and learn the matching costs at each 2D\ndisplacement hypothesis independently, ie, displacement-invariant cost\nlearning. Specifically, we apply the same 2D convolution-based matching net\nindependently on each 2D displacement hypothesis to learn a 4D cost volume.\nMoreover, we propose a displacement-aware projection layer to scale the learned\ncost volume, which reconsiders the correlation between different displacement\ncandidates and mitigates the multi-modal problem in the learned cost volume.\nThe cost volume is then projected to optical flow estimation through a 2D\nsoft-argmin layer.

This model has previously been tested on\nsmall-scale spilling breaking regular waves, whereas in this work focus is on\nfull (rather than model) scale application, wave groups (rather than regular\nwaves) and plunging (rather than spilling) breakers. Additionally this paper\nhas novel emphasis on bottom boundary layer dynamics which are very important\nfor cross-shore sediment transport predictions. The model is validated by\ncomparing with results from a previous experimental campaign. The model is\nshown to predict the surface elevations, velocities and turbulence well in the\nshoaling and outer surf-zone, avoiding turbulence over-production and incorrect\nundertow structure typical of standard turbulence closures. Comparison with\ndetailed boundary layer measurements in the shoaling position reveals that the\nmodel is able to accurately capture the temporal dynamics of the entire wave\nboundary layer, including evolution of the boundary layer thickness, velocity\novershoot and phase-shifts. Comparison in the surf zone additionally reveals\nthat the model is able to accurately capture the transport of breaking-induced\nturbulence into the wave boundary layer. The performance of the model indicates\nthat it can be used directly in the simulation of cross-shore sediment\ntransport and morphology and also be used to study important hydrodynamic\nprocesses, which can help improve the predictive skill of morphodynamic profile\nmodels applied in coastal engineering.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Oct 2020 10:05:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-29"}

We develop\nfor the first time a methodology to determine stellar abundances of elements\nothers than iron for M dwarf stars from high-resolution, optical spectra. Our\nmethodology is based on the use of principal component analysis and sparse\nBayesian's methods. We made use of a set of M dwarfs orbiting around an FGK\nprimary with known abundances to train our methods. We applied our methods to\nderive stellar metalliticies and abundances of a large sample of M dwarfs\nobserved within the framework of current radial velocity surveys. We then used\na sample of nearby FGK stars to cross-validate our technique by comparing the\nderived abundance trends in the M dwarf sample with those found on the FGK\nstars. The metallicity distribution of the different subsamples shows that M\ndwarfs hosting giant planets show a planet-metallicity correlation as well as a\ncorrelation with the stellar mass. M dwarfs hosting low-mass planets do not\nseem to follow the planet-metallicity correlation. We also found that the\nfrequency of low-mass planets does not depend on the mass of the stellar host.\nThese results seem in agreement with previous works.

Yet, there has been no precise experimental test on the\nmicroscale of the most basic aspects of such unsteady Stokes flow: the orbits\nof passive tracers and the position-dependent phase lag between the oscillating\nresponse of the fluid at a distant point and that of the driving particle.\nHere, we report the first such direct Lagrangian measurement of this unsteady\nflow. The method uses an array of $30$ submicron tracer particles positioned by\na time-shared optical trap at a range of distances and angular positions with\nrespect to a larger, central particle, which is then driven by an oscillating\noptical trap at frequencies up to $400$ Hz. In this microscale regime, the\ntracer dynamics is considerably simplified by the smallness of both inertial\neffects on particle motion and finite-frequency corrections to the Stokes drag\nlaw. The tracers are found to display elliptical Lissajous figures whose\norientation and geometry are in agreement with a low-frequency expansion of the\nunderlying dynamics, and the experimental phase shift between motion parallel\nand orthogonal to the oscillation axis exhibits a predicted scaling form in\ndistance and angle.

They are both mechanically and\noptically very robust and have a high gain and photon detection efficiency.\nThese features make them ideal photonsensors in a wide range of applications\nand they are nowadays replacing conventional photomultiplier tubes in many\nexperiments. The cellular structure of SiPMs where each cell can only detect\none photon at a time results in a non-linear dynamic range limiting the\npossible applications.\n  We studied a commonly used SiPM model based on an equivalent electronic\ncircuit that allows the simulation of the SiPM response in many situations.\nDedicated measurements with two consecutive light pulses prove its\napplicability.

We propose to inverse this temporal\nhierarchy and design a developmental process happening at the phylogenetic\ntimescale. Over a classic evolutionary search aimed at finding good gaits for\ntentacle 2D robots, we add a developmental process over the robots'\nmorphologies. Within a generation, the morphology of the robots does not\nchange. But from one generation to the next, the morphology develops.

The optical emission line flux ratios obtained from the\nHimalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT) observations however, show that S1 and S2\nboth fall in the AGN + SF (star formation) region of the BPT diagram. Weak AGN\nlying in the SF or AGN + SF intermediate regions in the BPT diagram have indeed\nbeen reported in the literature; our sources clearly fall in the same category.\nWe find an extended radio structure in our newly reduced 8.5 GHz VLA data, that\nis offset by ~1\" from the optical nucleus S2. New deep FUV and NUV observations\nwith the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) aboard AstroSat reveal SF knots\naround S2 as well as kpc-scale tidal tails; the SF knots around S2 coincide\nwith the extended radio structure detected at 8.5 GHz. The radio spectral\nindices are consistent with SF. Any possible association with the AGN in S2 is\nunclear at this stage.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Oct 2020 12:17:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-11"}

The cost of a treasure hunt algorithm is the worst-case\nnumber of edge traversals performed by the agent until finding the treasure.\nAwerbuch, Betke, Rivest and Singh [3] considered graph exploration and treasure\nhunt for finite graphs in a restricted model where the agent has a fuel tank\nthat can be replenished only at the starting node $s$.

Recently, the existence of image-agnostic perturbations, also known\nas universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs), were discovered. However,\nexisting UAPs still lack a sufficiently high fooling rate, when being applied\nto an unknown target model. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning\ntechnique for generating more transferable UAPs. We utilize a perturbation\ngenerator and some given pretrained networks so-called source models to\ngenerate UAPs using the ImageNet dataset. Due to the similar feature\nrepresentation of various model architectures in the first layer, we propose a\nloss formulation that focuses on the adversarial energy only in the respective\nfirst layer of the source models. This supports the transferability of our\ngenerated UAPs to any other target model. We further empirically analyze our\ngenerated UAPs and demonstrate that these perturbations generalize very well\ntowards different target models. Surpassing the current state of the art in\nboth, fooling rate and model-transferability, we can show the superiority of\nour proposed approach.

To address these issues, we\npropose a Speech-to-Text Adaptation for Speech Translation (STAST) model which\naims to improve the end-to-end model performance by bridging the modality gap\nbetween speech and text. Specifically, we decouple the speech translation\nencoder into three parts and introduce a shrink mechanism to match the length\nof speech representation with that of the corresponding text transcription. To\nobtain better semantic representation, we completely integrate a text-based\ntranslation model into the STAST so that two tasks can be trained in the same\nlatent space.

Intelligent\nbehaviour appeared in a decision process can be treated as a point y, the\ndynamic state observed and controlled by the agent, moving in a factor space\nimpelled by the goal factor and blocked by the constraint factors. Suppose that\nthe feasible region is cut by a group of hyperplanes, when point y reaches the\nregion's wall, a hyperplane will block the moving and the agent needs to adjust\nthe moving direction such that the target is pursued as faithful as possible.\nSince the wall is not able to be represented to a differentiable function, the\ngradient method cannot be applied to describe the adjusting process. We,\ntherefore, suggest a new model, named linear adjusting programming (LAP) in\nthis paper. LAP is similar as a kind of relaxed linear programming (LP), and\nthe difference between LP and LAP is: the former aims to find out the ultimate\noptimal point, while the latter just does a direct action in short period. You\nmay ask: Where will a blocker encounter? How can the moving direction be\nadjusted? Where further blockers may be encountered next, and how should the\ndirection be adjusted again? We request at least an adjusting should be\nachieved at the first time. If a hyperplane blocks y going ahead along with the\ndirection d, then we must adjust the new direction d' as the projection of g in\nthe blocking plane. If there is only one blocker at a time, it is\nstraightforward to calculate the projection, but how to calculate the\nprojection when there are more than one blocker encountered simultaneously? We\nsuggest a projection calculation by means of the Hat matrix in this paper.\nLinear adjusting programming will attract interest in many fields.

Small-scale vortices have been proposed to play an important\nrole in energy transport in the solar atmosphere. However, their physical\nproperties remain poorly understood due to the limited spatial resolution of\nthe observations. We aim to explore and analyze the physical properties of\nsmall-scale vortices inside magnetic flux tubes using numerical simulations,\nand to investigate whether they contribute to heating the chromosphere in a\nplage region. Using the three-dimensional (3D) radiative magnetohydrodynamic\n(MHD) simulation code 'MURaM', we perform numerical simulations of a unipolar\nsolar plage region. To detect and isolate vortices, we use the Swirling\nStrength criterion and select the locations where the fluid is rotating with an\nangular velocity greater than a certain threshold. We concentrate on\nsmall-scale as they are the strongest and carry most of the energy. We explore\nthe spatial profiles of physical quantities viz. density, horizontal velocity,\netc. inside these vortices. Moreover, to apprehend their general\ncharacteristics, a statistical investigation is performed. Magnetic flux tubes\nhave a complex filamentary substructure harbouring an abundance of small-scale\nvortices. At the interfaces between vortices strong current sheets are formed\nthat may dissipate and heat the solar chromosphere. Statistically, vortices\nhave higher densities and higher temperatures than the average values at the\nsame geometrical height in the chromosphere. We conclude that small-scale\nvortices are ubiquitous in solar plage regions, and they are denser and hotter\nstructures that contribute to chromospheric heating, possibly by dissipation of\nthe current sheets formed at their interfaces.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Oct 2020 13:34:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-04"}

In the first part of the paper we establish the exact\nstructure of the difference light curves attributed to microlensing from\nphotometric monitoring programmes in the literature. We then show from measures\nof surface brightness that the probability of microlensing by stars in the\ncluster is negligibly small.

A repeatable process accurately binds quantum dots to the tip\nof the antenna-embedded nanocone. As a result we achieve simultaneous 20-fold\nemission rate enhancement and record-high directionality leading to an increase\nin the observed brightness by a factor as large as 580 (120) into an NA = 0.22\n(0.5). We project that such miniaturized on-chip devices can reach photon rates\napproaching 2.3*10^8 single photons/second thus enabling ultra-fast\nlight-matter interfaces for quantum technologies at ambient conditions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Oct 2020 14:49:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2020 07:44:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-19"}

The model\ncan account for some basic observed properties of these systems that are not\nexpected in conventional models: (1) accretion on to the star at low X-ray\nluminosities and the transitions to the SP phase (no accretion) at critical\naccretion rates much lower than the rate required for the spin-up/spin-down\ntransition, (2) ongoing accretion throughout a large range of accretion rates\nwhile the source is spinning down (WP phase), and (3) transitions between the\nspin-up and spin-down phases with comparable torque magnitudes, without\nsubstantial changes in the mass-flow rate.

We first manually group the hashtags into six main categories,\nnamely, 1) General COVID, 2) Quarantine, 3) Panic Buying, 4) School Closures,\n5) Lockdowns, and 6) Frustration and Hope}, and study the temporal evolution of\ntweets in these hashtags. We conduct a linguistic analysis of words common to\nall hashtag groups and specific to each hashtag group and identify the chief\nconcerns of people as the pandemic gripped the nation (e.g., exploring bidets\nas an alternative to toilet paper). We conduct sentiment analysis and our\ninvestigation reveals that people reacted positively to school closures and\nnegatively to the lack of availability of essential goods due to panic buying.\nWe adopt a state-of-the-art semantic role labeling approach to identify the\naction words and then leverage a LSTM-based dependency parsing model to analyze\nthe context of action words (e.g., verb deal is accompanied by nouns such as\nanxiety, stress, and crisis). Finally, we develop a scalable seeded topic\nmodeling approach to automatically categorize and isolate tweets into hashtag\ngroups and experimentally validate that our topic model provides a grouping\nsimilar to our manual grouping. Our study presents a systematic way to\nconstruct an aggregated picture of peoples' response to the pandemic and lays\nthe groundwork for future fine-grained linguistic and behavioral analysis.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Oct 2020 19:30:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-10-30"}

However, domain adaptation\n(DA) is needed to alleviate the problem of domain shifts that typically occurs\nbetween video data captured in source and target do-mains. Given the laborious\ntask of collecting and annotating videos, and the subjective bias due to\nambiguity among adjacent intensity levels, weakly-supervised learning (WSL)is\ngaining attention in such applications. Yet, most state-of-the-art WSL models\nare typically formulated as regression problems, and do not leverage the\nordinal relation between intensity levels, nor the temporal coherence of\nmultiple consecutive frames. This paper introduces a new deep learn-ing model\nfor weakly-supervised DA with ordinal regression(WSDA-OR), where videos in\ntarget domain have coarse la-bels provided on a periodic basis. The WSDA-OR\nmodel enforces ordinal relationships among the intensity levels as-signed to\nthe target sequences, and associates multiple relevant frames to sequence-level\nlabels (instead of a single frame). In particular, it learns discriminant and\ndomain-invariant feature representations by integrating multiple in-stance\nlearning with deep adversarial DA, where soft Gaussian labels are used to\nefficiently represent the weak ordinal sequence-level labels from the target\ndomain. The proposed approach was validated on the RECOLA video dataset as\nfully-labeled source domain, and UNBC-McMaster video data as weakly-labeled\ntarget domain. We have also validated WSDA-OR on BIOVID and Fatigue (private)\ndatasets for sequence level estimation. Experimental results indicate that our\napproach can provide a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art\nmodels, allowing to achieve a greater localization accuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Oct 2020 03:20:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 2021 12:08:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 9 Nov 2021 16:04:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-10"}

As a consequence,\nthe flow must vanish at equilibrium. This functional can be interpreted as a\nmeasure of the topological complexity of the velocity field.

Even when tissue behavior is well understood, the exact subject\nspecific spatial distribution of material properties is often unknown. And,\nwhen developing computational models of biological tissue, it is usually\nprohibitively computationally expensive to simulate every plausible spatial\ndistribution of material properties for each problem of interest. Therefore,\none of the major challenges in developing accurate computational models of\nbiological tissue is capturing the potential effects of this spatial\nheterogeneity. Recently, machine learning based metamodels have gained\npopularity as a computationally tractable way to overcome this problem because\nthey can make predictions based on a limited number of direct simulation runs.\nThese metamodels are promising, but they often still require a high number of\ndirect simulations to achieve an acceptable performance.

Disease\ndetection and evaluation based on imaging is fast and cheap and therefore plays\nan important role in COVID-19 handling. COVID-19 is easier to detect in chest\nCT, however, it is expensive, non-portable, and difficult to disinfect, making\nit unfit as a point-of-care (POC) modality. On the other hand, chest X-ray\n(CXR) and lung ultrasound (LUS) are widely used, yet, COVID-19 findings in\nthese modalities are not always very clear. Here we train deep neural networks\nto significantly enhance the capability to detect, grade and monitor COVID-19\npatients using CXRs and LUS. Collaborating with several hospitals in Israel we\ncollect a large dataset of CXRs and use this dataset to train a neural network\nobtaining above 90% detection rate for COVID-19. In addition, in collaboration\nwith ULTRa (Ultrasound Laboratory Trento, Italy) and hospitals in Italy we\nobtained POC ultrasound data with annotations of the severity of disease and\ntrained a deep network for automatic severity grading.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Oct 2020 06:43:52 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Nov 2020 06:12:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-11"}

The\nPartial Variance of Increments (PVI) method is employed to find coherent\nstructures in the magnetic field data. The current sheet structures with\nreversal of magnetic field components are further selected. We consider the\nfollowing criteria to identify the MR events, such as current sheet with\nmagnetic field reversal, significant energy dissipation, and evident electron\noutflow velocity. Statistically, for most MR events, their PVI values are\nlarger than that of other types of coherent structures, and their energy\ndissipations are also stronger than that of others. However, due to the\nrelatively small proportion of MR events, their contribution to coherent\nstructures' energy dissipation is relatively trivial. If taken into account the\ndissipation of non-coherent structures, the MR's contribution to energy\ndissipation would be less. Hence, we suggest that MR events, though have strong\ndissipation locally, are not the major contributor to the energy dissipation in\nthe magnetosheath. After analyzing the features of non-MR current sheets, we\npropose that non-MR current sheets are mainly coherent structures inherent to\nkinetic Alfv\\'en fluctuations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 28 Oct 2020 02:27:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-10"}

This task, however, is\nextremely challenging due to 1) the highly complex spatial-temporal information\nin videos; and 2) the lack of labeled data for training. Unlike the\nrepresentation learning for static images, it is difficult to construct a\nsuitable self-supervised task to well model both motion and appearance\nfeatures. More recently, several attempts have been made to learn video\nrepresentation through video playback speed prediction. However, it is\nnon-trivial to obtain precise speed labels for the videos. More critically, the\nlearnt models may tend to focus on motion pattern and thus may not learn\nappearance features well. In this paper, we observe that the relative playback\nspeed is more consistent with motion pattern, and thus provide more effective\nand stable supervision for representation learning. Therefore, we propose a new\nway to perceive the playback speed and exploit the relative speed between two\nvideo clips as labels. In this way, we are able to well perceive speed and\nlearn better motion features. Moreover, to ensure the learning of appearance\nfeatures, we further propose an appearance-focused task, where we enforce the\nmodel to perceive the appearance difference between two video clips. We show\nthat optimizing the two tasks jointly consistently improves the performance on\ntwo downstream tasks, namely action recognition and video retrieval.\nRemarkably, for action recognition on UCF101 dataset, we achieve 93.7% accuracy\nwithout the use of labeled data for pre-training, which outperforms the\nImageNet supervised pre-trained model.
