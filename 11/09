In the\npresent paper I prove that both ontologies of unitarity and state purity are\nunfalsifiable, even in principle, and therefore axiomatically spurious. I\npropose instead a minimal four-postulate axiomatisation: 1) associate a Hilbert\nspace HA to each system A; 2) compose two systems by the tensor product rule\nHAB = HAxHB; 3) associate a transformation from system A to B to a quantum\noperation, i.e. to a completely positive trace-non-increasing map between the\ntrace-class operators of A and B; 4) (Born rule) evaluate all joint\nprobabilities through that of a special type of quantum operation: the state\npreparation. I then conclude that quantum paradoxes-such as the\nSchroedinger-cat's, and, most relevantly, the information paradox-are\noriginated only by the dogma of purification ontology, and they are no longer\nparadoxes of the theory in the minimal formulation. For the same reason, most\ninterpretations of the theory (e.g. many-world, relational, Darwinism,\ntransactional, von Neumann-Wigner, time-symmetric, ...) interpret the same\ndogma, not the strict theory stripped of the spurious postulates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Nov 2020 16:20:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-04"}

Monte Carlo methods act as a\nconvenient bridge for connecting intractable mathematical expressions with\nactionable estimates via sampling. Conventional approaches for simulating\nGaussian process posteriors view samples as draws from marginal distributions\nof process values at finite sets of input locations. This distribution-centric\ncharacterization leads to generative strategies that scale cubically in the\nsize of the desired random vector. These methods are prohibitively expensive in\ncases where we would, ideally, like to draw high-dimensional vectors or even\ncontinuous sample paths. In this work, we investigate a different line of\nreasoning: rather than focusing on distributions, we articulate Gaussian\nconditionals at the level of random variables. We show how this pathwise\ninterpretation of conditioning gives rise to a general family of approximations\nthat lend themselves to efficiently sampling Gaussian process posteriors.\nStarting from first principles, we derive these methods and analyze the\napproximation errors they introduce. We, then, ground these results by\nexploring the practical implications of pathwise conditioning in various\napplied settings, such as global optimization and reinforcement learning.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Nov 2020 17:09:37 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Jun 2021 19:38:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 30 Jul 2021 20:14:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-03"}

These processes occur over\nconsiderably different length and time scales; consequently, linking them to\nthe biomechanical properties of the lungs, and quantifying how they together\ncontrol the spatiotemporal features of inhalation, remains a challenge. We\naddress this challenge by developing a computational model of the lungs as a\nhierarchical, branched network of connected liquid-lined flexible cylinders\ncoupled to a viscoelastic thoracic cavity. Each branch opens at a rate and a\npressure that is determined by input biomechanical parameters, enabling us to\ntest the influence of changes in the mechanical properties of lung tissues and\nsecretions on inhalation dynamics. By summing the dynamics of all the branches,\nwe quantify the evolution of overall lung pressure and volume during\ninhalation, reproducing the shape of measured breathing curves.

Designing concurrent code is a non-trivial\ntask even in simplest of cases. Humans often design concurrent data structure\noperations by transforming sequential versions into their respective concurrent\nversions. This requires an understanding of the data structure, its sequential\nbehavior, thread interactions during concurrent execution and shared memory\nsynchronization primitives. We mechanize this design process using automated\ncommonsense reasoning. We assume that the data structure description is\nprovided as axioms alongside the sequential code of its algebraic operations.\nThis information is used to automatically derive concurrent code for that data\nstructure, such as dictionary operations for linked lists and binary search\ntrees. Knowledge in our case is expressed using Answer Set Programming (ASP),\nand we employ deduction, induction and abduction---just as humans do---in the\nreasoning involved. ASP allows for succinct modeling of first order theories of\npointer data structures, run-time thread interactions and shared memory\nsynchronization. Our reasoner can systematically make the same judgments as a\nhuman reasoner while constructing provably safe concurrent code. We present\nseveral reasoning challenges involved in transforming the sequential data\nstructure into its equivalent concurrent version. All the reasoning tasks are\nencoded in ASP and our reasoner can make sound judgments to transform\nsequential code into concurrent code. To the best of our knowledge, our work is\nthe first one to use commonsense reasoning to automatically transform\nsequential programs into concurrent code.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Nov 2020 18:25:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-10"}

Conventional\napproaches to metric learning mainly focus on learning the Mahalanobis distance\nmetric on data attributes. Recent research on metric learning has been extended\nto sequential data, where we only have structural information in the sequences,\nbut no attribute is available. However, real-world applications often involve\nattributed sequence data (e.g., clickstreams), where each instance consists of\nnot only a set of attributes (e.g., user session context) but also a sequence\nof categorical items (e.g., user actions). In this paper, we study the problem\nof metric learning on attributed sequences. Unlike previous work on metric\nlearning, we now need to go beyond the Mahalanobis distance metric in the\nattribute feature space while also incorporating the structural information in\nsequences. We propose a deep learning framework, called MLAS (Metric Learning\non Attributed Sequences), to learn a distance metric that effectively measures\ndissimilarities between attributed sequences.

Toward this goal, we propose two main deep\nlearning-based modules for: 1) cranberry fruit segmentation to delineate the\nexact fruit regions in the cranberry field image that are exposed to sun, 2)\nprediction of cloud coverage conditions and sun irradiance to estimate the\ninner temperature of exposed cranberries.

With 62.54% mIoU for\nsegmentation and 13.46 MAE for counting accuracies in exposed fruit\nidentification, this system is capable of giving informed feedback to growers\nto take precautionary action (e.g. irrigation) in identified crop field regions\nwith higher risk of sunburn in the near future.

Out-of-plane (OOP) coercivity (Hc),\nand saturation field (Hs) gradually increased with an increase in UL thickness\nregardless of interface mixing. For UL = 10 nm, the domain contrast and OOP\nstray field strength were enhanced, which may be due to the extent of d-d\nhybridization dominated over the influence of interfacial roughness.

To\ncapture the features of classical amenability that induce the vanishing of real\nbounded cohomology, we introduce the notion of normed $K$-amenability, of which\nwe prove an algebraic characterization. It implies that normed $K$-amenable\ngroups are locally elliptic, and it relates an invariant, the norm of a\n$K$-amenable group, to the order of its discrete finite $p$-subquotients, where\n$p$ is the characteristic of the residue field of $K$. Moreover, we prove a\nbounded-cohomological characterization for discrete groups.\n  The algebraic characterization shows that normed $K$-amenability is a very\nrestrictive condition, so the bounded cohomological one suggests that there\nshould be plenty of groups with rich bounded cohomology with trivial $K$\ncoefficients. We explore this intuition by studying the injectivity and\nsurjectivity of the comparison map, for which surprisingly general statements\nare available. Among these, we show that if either $K$ has positive\ncharacteristic or its residue field has characteristic 0, then the comparison\nmap is injective in all degrees.

The human vision system cannot\nprocess all information simultaneously due to the visual information\nbottleneck. In order to reduce the redundant input of visual information, the\nhuman visual system mainly focuses on dominant parts of scenes. This is\ncommonly known as visual saliency map prediction. This paper proposed a new\npsychophysical saliency prediction architecture, WECSF, inspired by\nmulti-channel model of visual cortex functioning in humans. The model consists\nof opponent color channels, wavelet transform, wavelet energy map, and contrast\nsensitivity function for extracting low-level image features and providing a\nmaximum approximation to the human visual system. The proposed model is\nevaluated using several datasets, including the MIT1003, MIT300, TORONTO,\nSID4VAM, and UCF Sports datasets. We also quantitatively and qualitatively\ncompare the saliency prediction performance with that of other state-of-the-art\nmodels. Our model achieved strongly stable and better performance with\ndifferent metrics on natural images, psychophysical synthetic images and\ndynamic videos.

However, for the task of speech\nenhancement in the time-frequency domain, this property cannot be fully\nexploited due to a lack of invariance in the frequency direction. In this paper\nwe propose to remedy this inefficiency by introducing a method, which we call\nFrequency Gating, to compute multiplicative weights for the kernels of the CNN\nin order to make them frequency dependent. Several mechanisms are explored:\ntemporal gating, in which weights are dependent on prior time frames, local\ngating, whose weights are generated based on a single time frame and the ones\nadjacent to it, and frequency-wise gating, where each kernel is assigned a\nweight independent of the input data. Experiments with an autoencoder neural\nnetwork with skip connections show that both local and frequency-wise gating\noutperform the baseline and are therefore viable ways to improve CNN-based\nspeech enhancement neural networks. In addition, a loss function based on the\nextended short-time objective intelligibility score (ESTOI) is introduced,\nwhich we show to outperform the standard mean squared error (MSE) loss\nfunction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Nov 2020 22:04:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-10"}

The efficiency of traditional\nclustering algorithms heavily depends on the distance functions used and the\ndimensionality of the features. Therefore, performance degradation is often\nobserved when tackling either unprocessed images or high-dimensional features\nextracted from processed images. To deal with these challenges, we propose a\ndeep clustering framework consisting of a modified generative adversarial\nnetwork (GAN) and an auxiliary classifier. The modification employs Sobel\noperations prior to the discriminator of the GAN to enhance the separability of\nthe learned features. The discriminator is then leveraged to generate\nrepresentations as the input to an auxiliary classifier. An adaptive objective\nfunction is utilised to train the auxiliary classifier for clustering the\nrepresentations, aiming to increase the robustness by minimizing the divergence\nof multiple representations generated by the discriminator. The auxiliary\nclassifier is implemented with a group of multiple cluster-heads, where a\ntolerance hyper-parameter is used to tackle imbalanced data.

In terms of shortening the\ncomputing time, t-SVD is replaced with the method computing an approximate\nt-SVD based on Qatar Riyal decomposition (CTSVD-QR), which can be used to\ncompute the largest $r \\left(r>0 \\right)$ singular values (tubes) and their\nassociated singular vectors (of tubes) iteratively. We, in addition, use the\ntensor $L_{2,1}$-norm instead of the tensor nuclear norm to minimize our model\non account of it is easy to optimize.

Bar chart characteristics were extracted in both an automated\nand manual fashion. These two approaches were then compared for accuracy. These\ncharacteristics were then compared using a Bland-Altman analysis. Results:\nBased on Bland-Altman analysis, 91.8% of data points were within the limits of\nagreement.

This mixture density has\nthe form of a kernel density estimator of errors and is referred to as the\nkernel-form error density (c.f., Zhang et al., 2014). While Zhang et al.

Generally\nspeaking, there are two classes of outflows, subsonic and supersonic (with\nrespect to a suitably defined sound speed). Three-fluid model without cosmic\nray diffusion can be studied in the same way as the classic stellar wind\nproblem, and is taken as a reference model. When cosmic ray diffusion is\nincluded, there are two categories of solutions. One of them resembles the\nthree-fluid model without diffusion, and the other behaves like thermal wind at\nlarge distances when the waves wither and cosmic rays are decoupled from the\nplasma. We also inspect the effect of wave damping mechanisms (such as,\nnonlinear Landau damping). Roughly speaking, the effect is much smaller in\nsupersonic outflow than in subsonic outflow.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Nov 2020 04:41:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-06"}

The framework integrates dark matter into a type-II minimally\nmodified gravity that was recently proposed as a dark energy mimicker. The idea\nthat makes such a framework possible consists of coupling a dark matter\nLagrangian and a cosmological constant to the metric in a canonically\ntransformed frame of general relativity (GR). On imposing a gauge fixing\nconstraint, which explicitly breaks the temporal diffeomorphism invariance, we\nkeep the number of gravitational degrees of freedom to be two, as in GR. We\nthen make the inverse canonical transformation to bring the theory back to the\noriginal frame, where one can add the standard matter fields. This framework\ncontains two free functions of time which specify the generating functional of\nthe above mentioned canonical transformation and which are then used in order\nto realize desired time evolutions of both the Hubble expansion rate $H(z)$ and\nthe effective gravitational constant for dark matter $G_{\\rm eff}(z)$. The aim\nof this paper is therefore to provide a new framework to address the two\npuzzles present in today's cosmology, i.e. the $H_0$ tension and the $S_8$\ntension, simultaneously. When the dark matter is cold in this framework, we dub\nthe corresponding cosmological model the V Canonical Cold Dark Matter (VCCDM),\nas the cosmological constant $\\Lambda$ in the standard $\\Lambda$CDM is replaced\nby a function $V(\\phi)$ of an auxiliary field $\\phi$ and the CDM is minimally\ncoupled to the metric in a canonically transformed frame.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Nov 2020 04:49:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-14"}

The input uncertainty is\nmeasured via bootstrapping, an equation-based stochastic kriging metamodel\npropagates the input uncertainty to the output mean, and both simulation and\nmetamodel uncertainty are derived using properties of the metamodel.

The states can be\ncharacterized by nonlinear functions on $S$ and it turns out that those\ncorresponding to non-trivial Dirac states are typically discontinuous.

However, these methods only utilize the enhanced feature as\nthe input of the speech recognition component, which are affected by the speech\ndistortion problem. In order to address this problem, this paper proposes a\ngated recurrent fusion (GRF) method with joint training framework for robust\nend-to-end ASR. The GRF algorithm is used to dynamically combine the noisy and\nenhanced features. Therefore, the GRF can not only remove the noise signals\nfrom the enhanced features, but also learn the raw fine structures from the\nnoisy features so that it can alleviate the speech distortion. The proposed\nmethod consists of speech enhancement, GRF and speech recognition. Firstly, the\nmask based speech enhancement network is applied to enhance the input speech.\nSecondly, the GRF is applied to address the speech distortion problem. Thirdly,\nto improve the performance of ASR, the state-of-the-art speech transformer\nalgorithm is used as the speech recognition component. Finally, the joint\ntraining framework is utilized to optimize these three components,\nsimultaneously. Our experiments are conducted on an open-source Mandarin speech\ncorpus called AISHELL-1. Experimental results show that the proposed method\nachieves the relative character error rate (CER) reduction of 10.04\\% over the\nconventional joint enhancement and transformer method only using the enhanced\nfeatures.

For this, the\nexperience of the robot, which can be bootstrapped from demonstrated\ntrajectories, is used to train a novel Neural Processes-based deep network that\nsamples from its latent space and generates the required trajectories given\ndesired rewards. Our framework can generate progressively improved trajectories\nby sampling them from high reward landscapes, increasing the reward gradually.\nVariational inference is used to create a stochastic latent space to sample\nvarying trajectories in generating population of trajectories given target\nrewards.

An AG code $C = C(\\mathcal{X}, \\mathcal{P}, D)$ over an\nalgebraic curve $\\mathcal{X}$ is a vector space associated to evaluations on\n$\\mathcal{P}$ of functions in the Riemann-Roch space $L_\\mathcal{X}(D)$. The\nproblem of testing proximity to an error-correcting code $C$ consists in\ndistinguishing between the case where an input word, given as an oracle,\nbelongs to $C$ and the one where it is far from every codeword of $C$. AG codes\nare good candidates to construct short proof systems, but there exists no\nefficient proximity tests for them. We aim to fill this gap.\n  We construct an Interactive Oracle Proof of Proximity (IOPP) for some\nfamilies of AG codes by generalizing an IOPP for Reed-Solomon codes introduced\nby Ben-Sasson, Bentov, Horesh and Riabzev, known as the FRI protocol. We\nidentify suitable requirements for designing efficient IOPP systems for AG\ncodes. Our approach relies on a neat decomposition of the Riemann-Roch space of\nany invariant divisor under a group action on a curve into several explicit\nRiemann-Roch spaces on the quotient curve. We provide sufficient conditions on\nan AG code $C$ that allow to reduce a proximity testing problem for $C$ to a\nmembership problem for a significantly smaller code $C'$.\n  As concrete instantiations, we study AG codes on Kummer curves and curves in\nthe Hermitian tower. The latter can be defined over polylogarithmic-size\nalphabet.

We also\nreport the kinematics and dimensions of the optical nebula associated with each\nULX using ancillary data from the PUMA Fabry-Perot spectrograph. A BPT analysis\ndemonstrates that most spaxels in NGC 925 are dominated by star-forming\nregions, including those associated with ULX-1 and ULX-3. Using the resolved\ngas-phase metallicities, a negative metallicity gradient is found, consistent\nwith previous results for spiral galaxies, while the ionization parameter tends\nto increase radially throughout the galaxy. Interestingly, ULX-1 shows a very\nlow gas metallicity for its galactocentric distance, identified by two\nindependent methods, while exhibiting a typical ionization. We find that such\nlow gas metallicity is best explained in the context of the high-mass X-ray\nbinary population, where the low-metallicity environment favours active Roche\nlobe overflows that can drive much higher accretion rates. An alternative\nscenario invoking accretion of a low-mass galaxy is not supported by the data\nin this region. Finally, ULX-3 shows both a high metallicity and ionization\nparameter, which is consistent with the progenitor being a highly-accreting\nneutron star within an evolved stellar population region.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Nov 2020 10:20:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-13"}

Among the various available\ntechniques, decentralized contact tracing that uses Bluetooth received signal\nstrength indication (RSSI) to detect proximity is considered less of a privacy\nrisk than approaches that rely on collecting absolute locations via GPS,\ncellular-tower history, or QR-code scanning. As of October 2020, there have\nbeen millions of downloads of such Bluetooth-based contract-tracing apps, as\nmore and more countries officially adopt them. However, the effectiveness of\nthese apps in the real world remains unclear due to a lack of empirical\nresearch that includes realistic crowd sizes and densities. This study aims to\nfill that gap, by empirically investigating the effectiveness of\nBluetooth-based contact tracing in crowd environments with a total of 80\nparticipants, emulating classrooms, moving lines, and other types of real-world\ngatherings. The results confirm that Bluetooth RSSI is unreliable for detecting\nproximity, and that this inaccuracy worsens in environments that are especially\ncrowded. In other words, this technique may be least useful when it is most in\nneed, and that it is fragile when confronted by low-cost jamming. Moreover,\ntechnical problems such as high energy consumption and phone overheating caused\nby the contact-tracing app were found to negatively influence users'\nwillingness to adopt it. On the bright side, however, Bluetooth RSSI may still\nbe useful for detecting coarse-grained contact events, for example, proximity\nof up to 20m lasting for an hour.

In a recent work, we show\nthat such shortcoming can be addressed by adopting a convolutional transform\nlearning (CTL) approach, where convolutional filters are learnt in an\nunsupervised fashion. The present paper aims at (i) proposing a deep version of\nCTL; (ii) proposing an unsupervised fusion formulation taking advantage of the\nproposed deep CTL representation; (iii) developing a mathematically sounded\noptimization strategy for performing the learning task. We apply the proposed\ntechnique, named DeConFuse, on the problem of stock forecasting and trading.\nComparison with state-of-the-art methods (based on CNN and long short-term\nmemory network) shows the superiority of our method for performing a reliable\nfeature extraction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Nov 2020 11:04:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-10"}

A special class of transcriptional repressors\noperates via a short-range mechanism, making local DNA regions inaccessible to\nbinding by activators, and thus providing an indirect repressive action on the\ntarget gene. This mechanism is commonly modeled assuming that repressors\ninteract with DNA under thermodynamic equilibrium and neglecting some\nconfigurations of the gene regulatory region. We elaborate on a more general\nnonequilibrium model of short-range repression using the graph formalism for\ntransitions between gene states, and we apply analytical calculations to\ncompare it with the equilibrium model in terms of the repression strength and\nexpression noise. In contrast to the equilibrium approach, the new model allows\nus to separate two basic mechanisms of short-range repression.

Although many deep learning models have recently\nbeen proposed in this domain, most of them treat the stock trading time-series\ndata as 2-D image data, whereas its true nature is 1-D time-series data. Since\nthe stock trading systems are multi-channel data, many existing techniques\ntreating them as 1-D time-series data are not suggestive of any technique to\neffectively fusion the information carried by the multiple channels. To\ncontribute towards both of these shortcomings, we propose an end-to-end\nsupervised learning framework inspired by the previously established\n(unsupervised) convolution transform learning framework. Our approach consists\nof processing the data channels through separate 1-D convolution layers, then\nfusing the outputs with a series of fully-connected layers, and finally\napplying a softmax classification layer. The peculiarity of our framework -\nSuperDeConFuse (SDCF), is that we remove the nonlinear activation located\nbetween the multi-channel convolution layers and the fully-connected layers, as\nwell as the one located between the latter and the output layer. We compensate\nfor this removal by introducing a suitable regularization on the aforementioned\nlayer outputs and filters during the training phase. Specifically, we apply a\nlogarithm determinant regularization on the layer filters to break symmetry and\nforce diversity in the learnt transforms, whereas we enforce the non-negativity\nconstraint on the layer outputs to mitigate the issue of dead neurons. This\nresults in the effective learning of a richer set of features and filters with\nrespect to a standard convolutional neural network. Numerical experiments\nconfirm that the proposed model yields considerably better results than\nstate-of-the-art deep learning techniques for real-world problem of stock\ntrading.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Nov 2020 11:58:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-10"}

From a science perspective it\nprovides the opportunity to compare markets trading similar shares, in a\nsimilar regulatory and economic environment, but with vastly different\nliquidity, costs and business models. A2X currently has competitive settlement\nand transaction pricing when compared to the JSE, but the JSE has deeper\nliquidity. In pursuit of an empirical understanding of how these differences\nrelate to their respective price response dynamics, we compare the\ndistributions and auto-correlations of returns on different time scales; we\ncompare price impact and master curves; and we compare the cost of trading on\neach exchange. This allows us to empirically compare the two markets. We find\nthat various stylised facts become similar as the measurement or sampling time\nscale increase. However, the same securities can have vastly different price\nresponses irrespective of time scales. This is not surprising given the\ndifferent liquidity and order-book resilience.

These\noutliers, we find, are the major cause of anisotropy of encoders' raw vector\nspaces, and clipping them leads to increased similarity across vectors. We\ndemonstrate this in practice by showing that clipped vectors can more\naccurately distinguish word senses, as well as lead to better sentence\nembeddings when mean pooling. In three supervised tasks, we find that clipping\ndoes not affect the performance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Nov 2020 12:49:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2020 09:24:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 25 May 2021 01:38:12 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-26"}

In\nthe quantum k-means algorithm, the core subroutine is the Quantum minimization\nalgorithm (GroverOptim), the client needs to repeat several Grover searches to\nfind the minimum value in each iteration to find a new clustering center, so we\nuse quantum homomorphic encryption scheme (QHE) to encrypt the data and upload\nit to the cloud for computing.

The principles of biological neuromodulation suggest a\nmethodology for designing and controlling mixed-feedback systems\nneuromorphically. The proposed design consists of a parallel interconnection of\nelementary circuit elements that mirrors the organization of biological neurons\nand utilizes the hardware components of neuromorphic electronic circuits. The\ninterconnection structure endows the neuromorphic systems with a simple control\nmethodology that reframes the neuronal control as an input-output shaping\nproblem. The potential of neuronal control is illustrated on elementary network\nexamples that suggest the scalability of the mixed-feedback principles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Nov 2020 14:06:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 24 Aug 2021 11:53:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-26"}

Despite numerous efforts, no consensus on quantifying this energy\nbalance has yet been reached. We aim to understand the reasons for the\ncontradicting results on energy partition obtained by various recent studies.\nWe considered five recent studies that address the thermal-nonthermal energy\npartition in solar flares. Their results are reviewed, and their methods are\ncompared and discussed in detail. The main uncertainties in deriving the energy\npartition are identified as (a) the derivation of the differential emission\nmeasure (DEM) distribution and (b) the role of the conductive energy loss for\nthe thermal component, as well as (c) the determination of the low-energy\ncutoff for the injected electrons. The bolometric radiated energy, as a proxy\nfor the total energy released in the flare, is a useful independent constraint\non both thermal and nonthermal energetics. In most of the cases, the derived\nenergetics are consistent with this constraint. There are indications that the\nthermal-nonthermal energy partition changes with flare strength: in weak\nflares, there appears to be a deficit of energetic electrons, while the\ninjected nonthermal energy is sufficient to account for the thermal component\nin strong flares. This behavior is identified as the main cause of the\ndissimilar results in the studies we considered. The changing partition has two\nimportant consequences: (a) an additional direct (i.e. non-beam) heating\nmechanism has to be present, and (b) considering that the bolometric emission\noriginates mainly from deeper atmospheric layers, conduction or waves are\nrequired as additional energy transport mechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Nov 2020 14:07:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-04"}

This task is tracking class-agnostic objects from a given target\nmask. For doing this, various approaches have been developed based on\nonline-learning, memory networks, and optical flow. These methods show high\naccuracy but are hard to be utilized in real-world applications due to slow\ninference time and tremendous complexity. To resolve this problem, template\nmatching methods are devised for fast processing speed but sacrificing lots of\nperformance in previous models. We introduce a novel semi-VOS model based on a\ntemplate matching method and a temporal consistency loss to reduce the\nperformance gap from heavy models while expediting inference time a lot. Our\ntemplate matching method consists of short-term and long-term matching. The\nshort-term matching enhances target object localization, while long-term\nmatching improves fine details and handles object shape-changing through the\nnewly proposed adaptive template attention module. However, the long-term\nmatching causes error-propagation due to the inflow of the past estimated\nresults when updating the template. To mitigate this problem, we also propose a\ntemporal consistency loss for better temporal coherence between neighboring\nframes by adopting the concept of a transition matrix.

Nevertheless, manually designing a neural network for a\nspecific problem is very difficult and time-consuming due to the massive\nhyperparameter search space, long training times, and lack of technical\nguidelines for the hyperparameter selection. Moreover, most networks are highly\ncomplex, task specific and over-parametrized. Recently, multiobjective neural\narchitecture search (NAS) methods have been proposed to automate the design of\naccurate and efficient architectures. However, they only optimize either the\nmacro- or micro-structure of the architecture requiring the unset\nhyperparameters to be manually defined, and do not use the information produced\nduring the optimization process to increase the efficiency of the search. In\nthis work, we propose EMONAS, an Efficient MultiObjective Neural Architecture\nSearch framework for the automatic design of neural architectures while\noptimizing the network's accuracy and size. EMONAS is composed of a search\nspace that considers both the macro- and micro-structure of the architecture,\nand a surrogate-assisted multiobjective evolutionary based algorithm that\nefficiently searches for the best hyperparameters using a Random Forest\nsurrogate and guiding selection probabilities. EMONAS is evaluated on the task\nof 3D cardiac segmentation from the MICCAI ACDC challenge, which is crucial for\ndisease diagnosis, risk evaluation, and therapy decision. The architecture\nfound with EMONAS is ranked within the top 10 submissions of the challenge in\nall evaluation metrics, performing better or comparable to other approaches\nwhile reducing the search time by more than 50% and having considerably fewer\nnumber of parameters.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Nov 2020 14:41:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-10"}

In the context of\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA), the linear combinations of the original\nvariables having the largest amounts of variation are determined by this\nnumber. In this paper, we study the high dimensional asymptotic regime where\nthe number of variables grows at the same rate as the number of observations,\nand use the spiked covariance model proposed in Johnstone (2001), under which\nthe problem reduces to model selection. Our focus is on the Akaike Information\nCriterion (AIC) which is known to be strongly consistent from the work of Bai\net al. (2018). However, Bai et al. (2018) requires a certain \"gap condition\"\nensuring the dominant eigenvalues to be above a threshold strictly larger than\nthe BBP threshold (Baik et al.

It is well-known\nthat, below the BBP threshold, a spiked covariance structure becomes\nindistinguishable from one with no spikes. Thus the strong consistency of AIC\nrequires some extra signal strength.\n  In this paper, we investigate whether consistency continues to hold even if\nthe \"gap\" is made smaller. We show that strong consistency under arbitrarily\nsmall gap is achievable if we alter the penalty term of AIC suitably depending\non the target gap. Furthermore, another intuitive alteration of the penalty can\nindeed make the gap exactly zero, although we can only achieve weak consistency\nin this case.

It is\ncommon to measure the performance of a supervised machine learning algorithm by\nplotting its \"learning curve\", that is, the decay of the error rate as a\nfunction of the number of training examples. However, the classical theoretical\nframework for understanding learnability, the PAC model of Vapnik-Chervonenkis\nand Valiant, does not explain the behavior of learning curves: the\ndistribution-free PAC model of learning can only bound the upper envelope of\nthe learning curves over all possible data distributions. This does not match\nthe practice of machine learning, where the data source is typically fixed in\nany given scenario, while the learner may choose the number of training\nexamples on the basis of factors such as computational resources and desired\naccuracy.\n  In this paper, we study an alternative learning model that better captures\nsuch practical aspects of machine learning, but still gives rise to a complete\ntheory of the learnable in the spirit of the PAC model. More precisely, we\nconsider the problem of universal learning, which aims to understand the\nperformance of learning algorithms on every data distribution, but without\nrequiring uniformity over the distribution. The main result of this paper is a\nremarkable trichotomy: there are only three possible rates of universal\nlearning. More precisely, we show that the learning curves of any given concept\nclass decay either at an exponential, linear, or arbitrarily slow rates.\nMoreover, each of these cases is completely characterized by appropriate\ncombinatorial parameters, and we exhibit optimal learning algorithms that\nachieve the best possible rate in each case.\n  For concreteness, we consider in this paper only the realizable case, though\nanalogous results are expected to extend to more general learning scenarios.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Nov 2020 15:10:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-10"}

The lower\nlimit of Omega_HI,limit = 2.1 * 10^{-4} h_70^{-1}, obtained by directly\nintegrating the HI mass of galaxies with M_* > 10^{10} M_solar, confirms that\nmassive star-forming galaxies do not dominate the neutral gas at z ~ 1. We\nstudy the evolution of the HI mass to stellar mass ratio from z ~ 1 to today\nand find a steeper relation between HI gas mass fraction and stellar mass at\nhigher redshifts. Specifically, galaxies with M_* = 10^{11} M_solar at z ~ 1\nare found to have 3 - 4 times higher neutral gas fractions than local galaxies,\nwhile the increase is as high as 4 - 12 times at M_* = 10^{10} M_solar. The\nquantity M_HI/SFR exhibits very large scatter, and the scatter increases from a\nfactor of 5 - 7 at z = 0 to factors close to a hundred at z = 1. This implies\nthat there is no relation between HI gas and star formation in high redshift\ngalaxies. The HI gas must be linked to cosmological gas accretion processes at\nhigh redshifts.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Nov 2020 15:29:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 8 Feb 2021 11:28:29 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-07"}

The\nproblem of unmeasured confounding in settings with multiple treatments is most\ncommon in statistical genetics and bioinformatics settings, where researchers\nhave developed many successful statistical strategies without engaging deeply\nwith the causal aspects of the problem. Recently there have been a number of\nattempts to bridge the gap between these statistical approaches and causal\ninference, but these attempts have either been shown to be flawed or have\nrelied on fully parametric assumptions. In this paper, we propose two\nstrategies for identifying and estimating causal effects of multiple treatments\nin the presence of unmeasured confounding. The auxiliary variables approach\nleverages variables that are not causally associated with the outcome; in the\ncase of a univariate confounder, our method only requires one auxiliary\nvariable, unlike existing instrumental variable methods that would require as\nmany instruments as there are treatments. An alternative null treatments\napproach relies on the assumption that at least half of the confounded\ntreatments have no causal effect on the outcome, but does not require a priori\nknowledge of which treatments are null. Our identification strategies do not\nimpose parametric assumptions on the outcome model and do not rest on\nestimation of the confounder.

Recently, Gao, Ramadurai, Wanless, and Wormald\nproved that in every proper edge coloring of a graph with $q$ colors where each\ncolor appears at least $q+o(q)$ times, there is always a rainbow matching using\nevery color. We strengthen this result by simultaneously relaxing two\nconditions: (i) we lift the condition on the number of colors and allow any\nfinite number of colors and instead, put a weaker condition requiring the\nmaximum degree of the graph to be at most $q$, and (ii) we also relax the\nproper coloring condition and require that the graph induced by each of the\ncolors have bounded degree. This strengthening resolves a natural question\ninspired by the remarks made by Gao, Ramadurai, Wanless, and Wormald.\n  As an application of this result, we show that for every proper edge coloring\nof a graph with $2q+o(q)$ colors where each color appears at least $q$ times,\nthere is always a rainbow matching of size $q$.

If they emerged with low to modest eccentricity\norbits from a common gaseous disk around the central super-massive black hole,\ntheir inferred lifespan would not be sufficiently long to account for the\nexcitation of their high orbital eccentricity through dynamical relaxation.\nHere we analyze the secular perturbation on Galactic Center stars by an\nintermediate-mass companion (IMC) as a potential mechanism to account for these\nyoung disk stars' high eccentricity. This IMC may be either an\nintermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) or a compact cluster such as IRS-13E.

If it\norbits around the SMBH in the same direction as the disk stars, the\neccentricity of the young stars can still be highly excited by the IMC during\nthe depletion of their natal disk, possible associated with the launch of the\nFermi bubble. In this scenario, IMC's precession rate decreases and its secular\nresonance sweeps through the proximity of the young stars. We carry out\nnumerical simulations with various inclination angles between the orbits of IMC\nand the disk stars and show this secular interaction is a robust mechanism to\nexcite the eccentricity and inclination of some disk stars.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Nov 2020 08:09:56 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-06"}

The -OH group in the backbone\nstructure enables a base-catalyzed nucleophilic attack by the deprotonated\nhydroxyl on the adjacent phosphorous and consequent self-hydrolysis of the\nphosphodiester bond. As expected for in-line hydrolytic cleavage reactions, the\nchemical stability of mRNA strands is highly dependent on external\nenvironmental factors, e.g. pH, temperature, oxidizers, etc. Predicting this\nchemical instability using a computational model will reduce the number of\nsequences synthesized and tested through identifying the most promising\ncandidates, aiding the development of mRNA related therapies. This paper\nproposes and evaluates three deep learning models (Long Short Term Memory,\nGated Recurrent Unit, and Graph Convolutional Networks) as methods to predict\nthe reactivity and risk of degradation of mRNA sequences.

The objective was to develop and evaluate the\nperformance of a novel 'M3' deep learning framework on RPD detection. Materials\nand Methods A deep learning framework M3 was developed to detect RPD presence\naccurately using CFP alone, FAF alone, or both, employing >8000 CFP-FAF image\npairs obtained prospectively (Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2). The M3\nframework includes multi-modal (detection from single or multiple image\nmodalities), multi-task (training different tasks simultaneously to improve\ngeneralizability), and multi-attention (improving ensembled feature\nrepresentation) operation. Performance on RPD detection was compared with\nstate-of-the-art deep learning models and 13 ophthalmologists; performance on\ndetection of two other AMD features (geographic atrophy and pigmentary\nabnormalities) was also evaluated. Results For RPD detection, M3 achieved area\nunder receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) 0.832, 0.931, and 0.933 for CFP\nalone, FAF alone, and both, respectively. M3 performance on CFP was very\nsubstantially superior to human retinal specialists (median F1-score 0.644\nversus 0.350). External validation (on Rotterdam Study, Netherlands)\ndemonstrated high accuracy on CFP alone (AUROC 0.965). The M3 framework also\naccurately detected geographic atrophy and pigmentary abnormalities (AUROC\n0.909 and 0.912, respectively), demonstrating its generalizability.

Methods: PD-L1\nexpression was evaluated in 65 surgically resected sarcomatoid carcinomas. The\nclinicopathologic features of cases with PD-L1-positive and negative tumors\nwere compared. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed. Multiple Cox\nproportional hazard regression analysis was performed to determine independent\npredictors of overall survival. Results: PD-L1 antibody positivity was found in\n72.3% of surgically resected sarcomatoid lung carcinomas. Regarding\nhistopathologic subtypes, PD-L1 expression was positive in 80.4% of pleomorphic\ncarcinomas, 62.5% of spindle- and/or giant-cell carcinomas, and 16.7% of\ncarcinosarcomas. Pleural invasion was observed in 68.1% of PD-L1-positive cases\nand 27.8% of PD-L1-negative cases (p = 0.008). No difference in survival was\nfound between PD-L1-positive and negative tumors. The only factor significantly\nassociated with poor survival was the pathological stage of the tumor.\nConclusions: This study reveals a high rate of PD-L1 positivity in a large\nnumber of sarcomatoid lung carcinoma cases with pleomorphic carcinoma, spindle-\nand/or giantcell carcinoma, and carcinosarcoma subtypes. The only significantly\ndifferent clinicopathologic feature in PD-L1-positive cases is pleural\ninvasion. PD-L1 positivity is not a significant predictor of survival in\nsarcomatoid lung carcinomas.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Nov 2020 18:59:24 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-12"}

Additionally we study the non-commutative\nquantum Bianchi II models when an aligned electromagnetic field is included.\nThrough the use of the Euclidean-signature semi classical method we find a\nplethora of new solutions to these model's corresponding Lorentzian signature\nWheeler DeWitt equations which we can interpret qualitatively. These new\nsolutions for the aforementioned models involving matter sources reveal some\npotentially interesting effects that should be chronicled as possible phenomena\nthat a toy model of quantum gravity can induce on the evolution of a quantum\nuniverse. Furthermore we find 'excited' states which behave differently from\nthe 'excited' states of the Bianchi IX and Taub models that were previously\nuncovered using this method. By comparing and contrasting the 'excited' states\ngiven by these models we help facilitate a better understating of what\nconstitutes an 'excited' state solution of the Wheeler Dewitt equation. Our\nresults further show the utility of the Euclidean-signature semi classical\nmethod for tackling Lorentzian signature problems without having to invoke a\nWick rotation. This feature of not needing to apply a Wick rotation makes this\nmethod potentially very useful for tackling a variety of problems in bosonic\nrelativistic field theory and quantum gravity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Nov 2020 15:38:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 16 Mar 2021 16:17:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-17"}

Each time step for SFI\nconsists of an outer loop, in which there are inner Newton loops to implicitly\nand sequentially solve the pressure and transport sub-problems. In standard\nSFI, the sub-problems are usually solved with tight tolerances at every outer\niteration. This can result in wasted computations that contribute little\nprogress towards the coupled solution. The issue is known as `over-solving'.\nOur objective is to minimize the cost of inner solvers while maintaining the\nconvergence rate of SFI. We first extended a nonlinear-acceleration (NA)\nframework (Jiang and Tchelepi 2019) to multi-component compositional models,\nfor ensuring robust outer-loop convergence. We then developed inexact-type\nmethods that alleviate `over-solving'. It is found that there is no need for\none sub-problem to strive for perfection, while the coupled (outer) residual\nremains high due to the other sub-problem. The new SFI solver was tested using\nseveral complex cases. The problems involve multi-phase and EoS-based\ncompositional fluid systems. We compared different strategies such as fixed\nrelaxations on absolute and relative tolerances for the inner solvers, as well\nas an adaptive approach. The results show that the basic SFI method is quite\ninefficient. Away from a coupled solution, additional accuracy achieved in\ninner solvers is wasted, contributing to little or no reduction of the overall\nouter residual. By comparison, the adaptive inexact method provides relative\ntolerances adequate for the current convergence state of the sub-problems. We\nshow across a wide range of flow conditions that the new solver can effectively\nresolve the over-solving issue, and thus greatly improve the overall\nefficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Nov 2020 14:15:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Aug 2021 13:35:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-05"}

Cone beam computed tomography\n(CBCT), computed tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance (MR) images thereby\nprovides complementary functional and/or structural information of the targeted\nregion and organs at risk. Merging this information relies on a correct spatial\nalignment of the observed anatomy between the acquired images. This can be\nachieved by the means of multi-modal deformable image registration (DIR),\ndemonstrated to be capable of estimating dense and elastic deformations between\nimages acquired by multiple imaging devices. However, due to the typically\ndifferent field-of-view (FOV) sampled across the various imaging modalities,\nsuch algorithms may severely fail in finding a satisfactory solution.\n  In the current study we propose a new fast method to align the FOV in\nmulti-modal 3D medical images.
