These experiments can be interpreted as a quantum-mechanical\nversion of non-equilibrium mixing between two volumes separated by a thin\ninterface. One of the principal goals of such experiments is in identifying\nnon-equilibrium conditions when time-symmetric laws give way to\ntime-directional, irreversible processes, which are represented by decoherence\nat the quantum level. The rate of decoherence is suggested to be examined\nindirectly, with minimal intrusions -- this can be achieved by measuring\ntunnelling rates that, in turn, are affected by decoherence. Decoherence is\nunderstood here as a general process that does not involve any significant\nexchanges of energy and governed by a particular class of the Kraus operators.\nThe present work analyses different regimes of tunnelling in the presence of\ndecoherence and obtains formulae that link the corresponding rates of\ntunnelling and decoherence under different conditions. It is shown that the\neffects on tunnelling of intrinsic decoherence and of decoherence due to\nunitary interactions with the environment are similar but not the same and can\nbe distinguished in experiments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Nov 2020 23:11:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 19 Sep 2021 02:40:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-21"}

This work focuses on intermittency\nin the Lagrangian velocity statistics in a canopy flow, which is observed in\ntwo distinct forms. The first, small scale intermittency, is expressed by\nnon-Gaussian and not self-similar statistics of the velocity increments. The\nanalysis shows an agreement in comparison with previous results from\nhomogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT) using the multifractal model, extended\nself-similarity, and acceleration autocorrelations. These observations suggest\nthat the picture of small-scale Lagrangian intermittency in canopy flows is\nsimilar to that in HIT, and therefore, they extend the idea of universal\nLagrangian intermittency to certain inhomogeneous and anisotropic flows.\nSecond, it is observed that the RMS of energy increments along Lagrangian\ntrajectories depend on the direction of the trajectories' time-averaged\nturbulent velocity. Subsequent analysis suggests that the flow is attenuated by\nthe canopy drag while leaving the structure function's scaling unchanged. This\nobservation implies the existence of large-scale intermittency in Lagrangian\nstatistics. Thus, this work presents a first empirical evidence of intermittent\nLagrangian velocity statistics in a canopy flow that exists in two distinct\nsenses and occurs due to different mechanisms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Nov 2020 16:08:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 9 Jan 2021 14:21:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-01"}

In this work I advance a method for teaching the 2nd law\nthat combines the paradigm-shift significance of the 1st and the mathematical\nproclivity of the 3rd. The approach is rooted in the historical method, indeed,\nplaced in its historical context, Kepler's 2nd is as revolutionary as the 1st:\nas the 1st law does away with the epicycle, the 2nd law does away with the\nequant. This way of teaching the 2nd law also formulates the \"time=area\"\nstatement quantitatively, in the way of Kepler's equation, M = E - e sin E\n(relating mean anomaly M, eccentric anomaly E, and eccentricity e), where the\nleft-hand side is time and the right-hand side is area. In doing so, it\nnaturally paves the way to finishing the module with an active learning\ncomputational exercise, for instance, to calculate the timing and location of\nMars' next opposition.

Our results demonstrate a connection between the line emitting regions\nand physical properties of the X-ray irradiation heating the discs during\noutburst cycles of LMXBs. Further, we are able to show that changes in the\nphysical properties of the irradiation heating the disc in outburst can be\nimprinted within the H/He emission line profiles themselves in these systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Nov 2020 18:08:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-06"}

However, capturing\nmemory access patterns of an application at runtime comes at a cost, which is\nparticularly challenging for large scale parallel applications that may be\nsensitive to system noise.\n  In this work, we focus on the access pattern profiling phase prior to the\nactual memory relocation. We study the feasibility of using Intel's Processor\nEvent-Based Sampling (PEBS) feature to record memory accesses by sampling at\nruntime and study the overhead at scale. We have implemented a custom PEBS\ndriver in the IHK/McKernel lightweight multi-kernel operating system, one of\nwhose advantages is minimal system interference due to the lightweight kernel's\nsimple design compared to other OS kernels such as Linux. We present the PEBS\noverhead of a set of scientific applications and show the access patterns\nidentified in noise-sensitive HPC applications. Our results show that clear\naccess patterns can be captured with a 10% overhead in the worst-case and 1% in\nthe best case when running on up to 128k CPU cores (2,048 Intel Xeon Phi\nKnights Landing nodes). We conclude that online memory access profiling using\nPEBS at large scale is promising for memory management in heterogeneous memory\nenvironments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Nov 2020 18:39:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-30"}

Here, we present the results of an\nextensive 4-year Keck/HIRES radial-velocity (RV) follow-up program of the\nWASP-107 system and provide a detailed study of the physics governing the\naccretion of its gas envelope. We reveal that WASP-107b's mass is only 1.8\nNeptune masses ($M_b = 30.5 \\pm 1.7$ $M_\\oplus$). The resulting extraordinarily\nlow density suggests that WASP-107b has a H/He envelope mass fraction of $>\n85$% unless it is substantially inflated. The corresponding core mass of $<4.6$\n$M_\\oplus$ at 3$\\sigma$ is significantly lower than what is traditionally\nassumed to be necessary to trigger massive gas envelope accretion. We\ndemonstrate that this large gas-to-core mass ratio most plausibly results from\nthe onset of accretion at $\\gtrsim 1$ AU onto a low-opacity, dust-free\natmosphere and subsequent migration to the present-day $a_b = 0.0566 \\pm\n0.0017$ AU.

The main task of HUSPM is to find all\nsubsequences, within a quantitative sequential database, that have high utility\nwith respect to a user-defined minimum utility threshold. However, it is\ndifficult to specify the minimum utility threshold, especially when database\nfeatures, which are invisible in most cases, are not understood.

Moreover, no systematic problem statement has been\ndefined. In this paper, we formulate the problem of top-k HUSPM and propose a\nnovel algorithm called TKUS.

However, conventional utility\nmining methods have a bias toward items that have longer on-shelf time as they\nhave a greater chance to generate a high utility. To eliminate the bias, the\nproblem of on-shelf utility mining (OSUM) is introduced. In this paper, we\nfocus on the task of OSUM of sequence data, where the sequential database is\ndivided into several partitions according to time periods and items are\nassociated with utilities and several on-shelf time periods. To address the\nproblem, we propose two methods, OSUM of sequence data (OSUMS) and OSUMS+, to\nextract on-shelf high-utility sequential patterns. For further efficiency, we\nalso designed several strategies to reduce the search space and avoid redundant\ncalculation with two upper bounds time prefix extension utility (TPEU) and time\nreduced sequence utility (TRSU). In addition, two novel data structures were\ndeveloped for facilitating the calculation of upper bounds and utilities.\nSubstantial experimental results on certain real and synthetic datasets show\nthat the two methods outperform the state-of-the-art algorithm. In conclusion,\nOSUMS may consume a large amount of memory and is unsuitable for cases with\nlimited memory, while OSUMS+ has wider real-life applications owing to its high\nefficiency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Nov 2020 19:38:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-30"}

The results of comparing networks\nwith and without the addition of XAUG variables show that XAUG variables can be\nused to interpret classifier behavior, increase discrimination ability when\ncombined with low-level features, and in some cases capture the behavior of the\nclassifier completely. The LRP technique can be used to find relevant\ninformation the network is using, and when combined with the XAUG variables,\ncan be used to rank features, allowing one to find a reduced set of features\nthat capture part of the network performance. In the studies presented, adding\nXAUG variables to low-level DNNs increased the efficiency of classifiers by as\nmuch as 30-40\\%. In addition to performance improvements, an approach to\nquantify numerical uncertainties in the training of these DNNs is presented.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Nov 2020 20:36:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Mar 2021 17:52:54 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 12 May 2021 19:38:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-01-11"}

It is based on the assumption that\ncomplex traits or characters can only be gained once and lost once in the\ncourse of evolution. Here, we consider a generalization of this model, namely\nDollo parsimony, that allows for multiple character losses. More precisely, we\ntake a combinatorial perspective on the notion of Dollo-$k$ characters, i.e.\ntraits that are gained at most once and lost precisely $k$ times throughout\nevolution. We first introduce an algorithm based on the notion of spanning\nsubtrees for finding a Dollo-$k$ labeling for a given character and a given\ntree in linear time. We then compare persistent characters (consisting of the\nunion of Dollo-0 and Dollo-1 characters) and general Dollo-$k$ characters.\nWhile it is known that there is a strong connection between Fitch parsimony and\npersistent characters, we show that Dollo parsimony and Fitch parsimony are in\ngeneral very different. Moreover, while it is known that there is a direct\nrelationship between the number of persistent characters and the Sackin index\nof a tree, a popular index of tree balance, we show that this relationship does\nnot generalize to Dollo-$k$ characters. In fact, determining the number of\nDollo-$k$ characters for a given tree is much more involved than counting\npersistent characters, and we end this manuscript by introducing a recursive\napproach for the former.

Within this context, brain age\nprediction from structural MR images and age-specific brain morphology template\ngeneration are two problems that have attracted much attention. While most\napproaches tackle these tasks independently, we assume that they are inverse\ndirections of the same functional bidirectional relationship between a brain's\nmorphology and an age variable. In this paper, we propose to model this\nrelationship with a single conditional normalizing flow, which unifies brain\nage prediction and age-conditioned generative modeling in a novel way. In an\ninitial evaluation of this idea, we show that our normalizing flow brain aging\nmodel can accurately predict brain age while also being able to generate\nage-specific brain morphology templates that realistically represent the\ntypical aging trend in a healthy population. This work is a step towards\nunified modeling of functional relationships between 3D brain morphology and\nclinical variables of interest with powerful normalizing flows.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Nov 2020 22:23:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-30"}

We assume that our graphs are unweighted and that terminals may\nbe part of the min-cut. In previous work, Kratsch and Wahlstr\\\"om (FOCS\n2012/JACM 2020) used connections to matroid theory to show that a vertex\nsparsifier $H$ with $O(k^3)$ vertices can be computed in randomized polynomial\ntime, even for arbitrary digraphs $G$. However, since then, no improvements on\nthe size $O(k^3)$ have been shown.\n  In this paper, we draw inspiration from the renowned Bollob\\'as's\nTwo-Families Theorem in extremal combinatorics and introduce the use of total\norderings into Kratsch and Wahlstr\\\"om's methods. This new perspective allows\nus to construct a sparsifier $H$ of $\\Theta(k^2)$ vertices for the case that\n$G$ is a DAG. We also show how to compute $H$ in time near-linear in the size\nof $G$, improving on the previous $O(n^{\\omega+1})$.

It is well\nknown that observability inequalities play a critical role in characterizing\nthe long time behaviour of solutions of evolution equations, which is the main\ngoal of this study. In order to address this, we truncate the nonlinearities,\nand thereby construct approximate solutions for which it is possible to obtain\na priori bounds and prove the essential observability inequality.

What we\nfind is that the contribution from Pop III stars to cosmic reionization\nsignificantly depends on the treatment of the escape fraction.

Overall, we found that cerebellar\nnetworks have a smaller DFC variability than other networks in the brain.\nMoreover, the internal structure of the cerebellum could be clearly divided in\ntwo distinct posterior and anterior parts, the latter also connected to the\nbrainstem. The mechanism to maintain small variability of the DFC in the\nposterior part of the cerebellum is consistent with another of our findings,\nnamely, that this structure exhibits the highest SC-DFC similarity relative to\nthe other networks studied. By contrast, the anterior part of the cerebellum\nalso exhibits small DFC variability but it has the lowest SC-DFC similarity,\nsuggesting a different mechanism is at play. Because this structure connects to\nthe brainstem, which regulates sleep cycles, cardiac and respiratory\nfunctioning, we suggest that such critical functionality drives the low\nvariability in the DFC.

We show that, in\nthe presence of a threshold resonance, the Dirac evolution satisfies the\nnatural decay rate, and satisfies the faster weighted bound except for a piece\nof rank at most two, one per threshold. Further, we prove high energy\ndispersive bounds that are near optimal with respect to the required smoothness\nof the initial data. To do so we use a variant of a high energy argument that\nwas originally developed to study Kato smoothing estimates for magnetic\nSchr\\\"odinger operators. This method has never been used before to obtain $L^1\n\\to L^\\infty$ estimates. As a consequence of our analysis we prove a uniform\nlimiting absorption principle, Strichartz estimates and prove the existence of\nan eigenvalue free region for the one dimensional Dirac operator with a\nnon-self-adjoint potential.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Nov 2020 01:32:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-31"}

Existing attacks on these systems either generate\nperturbations working merely in the digital world, or rely on customized\nequipments to generate perturbations and are not robust in varying physical\nenvironments. In this paper, we propose FaceAdv, a physical-world attack that\ncrafts adversarial stickers to deceive FR systems. It mainly consists of a\nsticker generator and a transformer, where the former can craft several\nstickers with different shapes and the latter transformer aims to digitally\nattach stickers to human faces and provide feedbacks to the generator to\nimprove the effectiveness of stickers. We conduct extensive experiments to\nevaluate the effectiveness of FaceAdv on attacking 3 typical FR systems (i.e.,\nArcFace, CosFace and FaceNet). The results show that compared with a\nstate-of-the-art attack, FaceAdv can significantly improve success rate of both\ndodging and impersonating attacks.

As a result, the classes only possessed\nby the unlabeled data may mislead the classifier training and thus hindering\nthe realistic landing of various SSL methods. To solve this problem, existing\nmethods usually divide unlabeled data to in-distribution (ID) data and\nout-of-distribution (OOD) data, and directly discard or weaken the OOD data to\navoid their adverse impact. In other words, they treat OOD data as completely\nuseless and thus the potential valuable information for classification\ncontained by them is totally ignored. To remedy this defect, this paper\nproposes a \"Transferable OOD data Recycling\" (TOOR) method which properly\nutilizes ID data as well as the \"recyclable\" OOD data to enrich the information\nfor conducting class-mismatched SSL. Specifically, TOOR firstly attributes all\nunlabeled data to ID data or OOD data, among which the ID data are directly\nused for training. Then we treat the OOD data that have a close relationship\nwith ID data and labeled data as recyclable, and employ adversarial domain\nadaptation to project them to the space of ID data and labeled data. In other\nwords, the recyclability of an OOD datum is evaluated by its transferability,\nand the recyclable OOD data are transferred so that they are compatible with\nthe distribution of known classes-of-interests. Consequently, our TOOR method\nextracts more information from unlabeled data than existing approaches, so it\ncan achieve the improved performance which is demonstrated by the experiments\non typical benchmark datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Nov 2020 02:29:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 6 Jan 2021 08:59:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 30 Mar 2021 01:28:31 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2022 05:56:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-13"}

While adversarial training (AT) is regarded\nas the most robust defense, it suffers from poor performance both on clean\nexamples and under other types of attacks, e.g. attacks with larger\nperturbations. Meanwhile, regularizers that encourage uncertain outputs, such\nas entropy maximization (EntM) and label smoothing (LS) can maintain accuracy\non clean examples and improve performance under weak attacks, yet their ability\nto defend against strong attacks is still in doubt. In this paper, we revisit\nuncertainty promotion regularizers, including EntM and LS, in the field of\nadversarial learning. We show that EntM and LS alone provide robustness only\nunder small perturbations. Contrarily, we show that uncertainty promotion\nregularizers complement AT in a principled manner, consistently improving\nperformance on both clean examples and under various attacks, especially\nattacks with large perturbations. We further analyze how uncertainty promotion\nregularizers enhance the performance of AT from the perspective of Jacobian\nmatrices $\\nabla_X f(X;\\theta)$, and find out that EntM effectively shrinks the\nnorm of Jacobian matrices and hence promotes robustness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Nov 2020 03:22:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-30"}

Therefore, this\npaper evaluates the performance of precise point positioning (PPP) service\nusing a software-defined receiver (SDR).

In particular, the isospin dependence of\nspin-orbit splitting has become increasingly important as $N/Z$ increases in\nneutron-rich nuclei. Following the initial independent-particle strategy\ntowards explaining the occurrence of magic numbers, we have systematically\ninvestigated the isospin effect on the shell evolution of neutron-rich nuclei\nwithin the Woods-Saxon (WS) mean-field potential plus the spin-orbit term. It\nis found that new magic numbers $N = 14$ and $N =16$ may emerge in neutron-rich\nnuclei if one changes the sign of the isospin-dependent term in the spin-orbit\ncoupling while the traditional magic number $N = 20$ may disappear. The magic\nnumber $N = 28$ is expected to be destroyed despite the sign choice of the\nisospin part in spin-orbit splitting, while $N = 50$ may disappear and $N = 82$\npersists within the single particle scheme. Besides, an appreciable amount of\nenergy gap appears at $N = 32$ and 34 in neutron-rich Ca isotopes. All these\nresults are more consistent with those of the interacting shell model, when the\nsign of the isospin term of the WS potential is different from that of the\ncorresponding spin-orbit coupling part. The present study may provide a more\nreasonable starting point for not only the interacting shell but also other\nnuclear many-body calculations towards the neutron-dripline.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Nov 2020 03:30:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-30"}

Advanced deep neural network (DNN) based\nobject detectors can easily steal users' personal information exposed in shared\nphotos. In this paper, we propose a novel adversarial example based\nprivacy-preserving technique for social images against object detectors based\nprivacy stealing. Specifically, we develop an Object Disappearance Algorithm to\ncraft two kinds of adversarial social images. One can hide all objects in the\nsocial images from being detected by an object detector, and the other can make\nthe customized sensitive objects be incorrectly classified by the object\ndetector. The Object Disappearance Algorithm constructs perturbation on a clean\nsocial image. After being injected with the perturbation, the social image can\neasily fool the object detector, while its visual quality will not be degraded.\nWe use two metrics, privacy-preserving success rate and privacy leakage rate,\nto evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Experimental results show\nthat, the proposed method can effectively protect the privacy of social images.\nThe privacy-preserving success rates of the proposed method on MS-COCO and\nPASCAL VOC 2007 datasets are high up to 96.1% and 99.3%, respectively, and the\nprivacy leakage rates on these two datasets are as low as 0.57% and 0.07%,\nrespectively.

We are given a dynamic flow network\nconsisting of an undirected path with positive edge lengths, positive edge\ncapacities, and nonnegative vertex weights. A path can be considered as a road,\nan edge length as the distance along the road and a vertex weight as the number\nof people at the site. An edge capacity limits the number of people that can\nenter the edge per unit time. We consider the problem of locating a sink in the\nnetwork, to which all the people evacuate from the vertices as quickly as\npossible. In our model, each weight is represented by a linear function in a\ncommon parameter $t$, and the decision maker who determines the location of a\nsink does not know the value of $t$. We formulate the sink location problem\nunder such uncertainty as the minmax regret problem. Given $t$ and a sink\nlocation $x$, the cost of $x$ under $t$ is the sum of arrival times at $x$ for\nall the people determined by $t$. The regret for $x$ under $t$ is the gap\nbetween the cost of $x$ under $t$ and the optimal cost under $t$.

A majority of\nexisting works generally focus on aligned fusion, mostly at word level, of the\nthree modalities to accomplish this task, which is impractical in real-world\nscenarios. To overcome this issue, we seek to address the task of multimodal\nsequence analysis on unaligned modality sequences which is still relatively\nunderexplored and also more challenging. Recurrent neural network (RNN) and its\nvariants are widely used in multimodal sequence analysis, but they are\nsusceptible to the issues of gradient vanishing/explosion and high time\ncomplexity due to its recurrent nature. Therefore, we propose a novel model,\ntermed Multimodal Graph, to investigate the effectiveness of graph neural\nnetworks (GNN) on modeling multimodal sequential data. The graph-based\nstructure enables parallel computation in time dimension and can learn longer\ntemporal dependency in long unaligned sequences. Specifically, our Multimodal\nGraph is hierarchically structured to cater to two stages, i.e., intra- and\ninter-modal dynamics learning. For the first stage, a graph convolutional\nnetwork is employed for each modality to learn intra-modal dynamics. In the\nsecond stage, given that the multimodal sequences are unaligned, the commonly\nconsidered word-level fusion does not pertain. To this end, we devise a graph\npooling fusion network to automatically learn the associations between various\nnodes from different modalities. Additionally, we define multiple ways to\nconstruct the adjacency matrix for sequential data. Experimental results\nsuggest that our graph-based model reaches state-of-the-art performance on two\nbenchmark datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Nov 2020 06:12:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2020 04:36:37 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 23 Apr 2021 17:09:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-26"}

In this paper, we propose a general approach to learn relation\nprototypesfrom unlabeled texts, to facilitate the long-tail relation extraction\nby transferring knowledge from the relation types with sufficient trainingdata.\nWe learn relation prototypes as an implicit factor between entities, which\nreflects the meanings of relations as well as theirproximities for transfer\nlearning. Specifically, we construct a co-occurrence graph from texts, and\ncapture both first-order andsecond-order entity proximities for embedding\nlearning.

Topological data analysis, a rising field in\nmathematics and computer science, concerns the shape of the data and has been\nproven effective in many scientific disciplines.

Persistent homology (PH) is one of the main\ndriving forces in TDA, and the idea is to track changes of geometric objects at\ndifferent scales. The persistence diagram (PD) summarizes the information of PH\nin the form of a multi-set. While PD provides useful information about the\nunderlying objects, it lacks fine relations about the local consistency of\nspecific pairs of generators in PD, such as the merging relation between two\nconnected components in the PH. The sheaf structure provides a novel point of\nview for describing the merging relation of local objects in PH.

The tunable gauge phase is\nmediated by the phase difference between the $\\mathcal{PT}$- and\nanti-$\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric mechanical couplings in a multimode\noptomechanical system. The transmission spectrum then exhibits the asymmetric\nFano line shape or double optomechanically induced transparency by modulating\nthe gauge phase. Moreover, the eigenvalues will collapse and become degenerate\nalthough the mechanical coupling is continuously increased. Such\ncounterintuitive energy-attraction, instead of anti-crossing, attributes to\ndestructive interferences between $\\mathcal{PT}$- and\nanti-$\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric couplings. We find that the energy-attraction, as\nwell as the accompanied exceptional points (EPs), can be more intuitively\nobserved in the cavity output power spectrum where the mechanical eigenvalues\ncorrespond to the peaks. For mechanical cooling, the average phonon occupation\nnumber becomes minimum at these EPs. Especially, phonon transport becomes\nnonreciprocal and even ideally unidirectional at the EPs.

The key idea is to consider NBP decoding over an overcomplete\nparity-check matrix and use the weights of NBP as a measure of the importance\nof the check nodes (CNs) to decoding. The unimportant CNs are then pruned. In\ncontrast to NBP, which performs decoding on a given fixed parity-check matrix,\nthe proposed pruning-based neural belief propagation (PB-NBP) typically results\nin a different parity-check matrix in each iteration. For a given complexity in\nterms of CN evaluations, we show that PB-NBP yields significant performance\nimprovements with respect to NBP.

In\nthis paper, we focus on the beamforming design problem for the downlink\nmultiuser uRLLC systems. Since the strict demand on the reliability and\nlatency, in general, short packet transmission is a favorable form for uRLLC\nsystems, which indicates the literature Shannon's capacity formula is no longer\napplicable. With the finite blocklength transmission, the achievable delivery\nrate is greatly influenced by the reliability and latency. Using the developed\nachievable delivery rate formula for finite blocklength transmission, we\nrespectively formulate the problems of interest as the weighted sum rate\nmaximization, energy efficiency maximization, and user fairness optimization by\nconsidering the maximum allowable transmission power and minimum rate\nrequirement. It's worthy pointing out that this is the first work to design the\nbeamforming vectors for the downlink multiuser uRLLC systems. To address these\nnon-convex problems, some important insights have been discovered by analyzing\nthe function of achievable delivery rate.

However, perspective effects\nstemming from the projection in a conventional camera vary for different global\npositions in the image. We introduce Perspective Crop Layers (PCLs) - a form of\nperspective crop of the region of interest based on the camera geometry - and\nshow that accounting for the perspective consistently improves the accuracy of\nstate-of-the-art 3D pose reconstruction methods. PCLs are modular neural\nnetwork layers, which, when inserted into existing CNN and MLP architectures,\ndeterministically remove the location-dependent perspective effects while\nleaving end-to-end training and the number of parameters of the underlying\nneural network unchanged. We demonstrate that PCL leads to improved 3D human\npose reconstruction accuracy for CNN architectures that use cropping\noperations, such as spatial transformer networks (STN), and, somewhat\nsurprisingly, MLPs used for 2D-to-3D keypoint lifting. Our conclusion is that\nit is important to utilize camera calibration information when available, for\nclassical and deep-learning-based computer vision alike. PCL offers an easy way\nto improve the accuracy of existing 3D reconstruction networks by making them\ngeometry aware.

Investigations of\ndynamical phase transitions combine aspects of symmetry, topology, and\nnon-equilibrium physics, however, progress has been hindered by the notorious\ndifficulties of predicting the time evolution of large, interacting quantum\nsystems. Here, we tackle this outstanding problem by determining the critical\ntimes of interacting many-body systems after a quench using Loschmidt\ncumulants. Specifically, we investigate dynamical topological phase transitions\nin the interacting Kitaev chain and in the spin-1 Heisenberg chain. To this\nend, we map out the thermodynamic lines of complex times, where the Loschmidt\namplitude vanishes, and identify the intersections with the imaginary axis,\nwhich yield the real critical times after a quench. For the Kitaev chain, we\ncan accurately predict how the critical behavior is affected by strong\ninteractions, which gradually shift the time at which a dynamical phase\ntransition occurs. We also discuss the experimental perspectives of predicting\nthe first critical time of a quantum many-body system by measuring the energy\nfluctuations in the initial state, and we describe the prospects of\nimplementing our method on a near-term quantum computer with a limited number\nof qubits.

As a special design\nof this transformer, the information encoded in the encoder is different from\nthat in the decoder, i.e. the encoder encodes temporal-channel information of\nmultiple frames while the decoder decodes the spatial-channel information for\nthe current frame in a voxel-wise manner. Specifically, the temporal-channel\nencoder of the transformer is designed to encode the information of different\nchannels and frames by utilizing the correlation among features from different\nchannels and frames. On the other hand, the spatial decoder of the transformer\nwill decode the information for each location of the current frame. Before\nconducting the object detection with detection head, the gate mechanism is\ndeployed for re-calibrating the features of current frame, which filters out\nthe object irrelevant information by repetitively refine the representation of\ntarget frame along with the up-sampling process.

In this paper, we consider a more realistic\nscenario where the new feature representation is suboptimal and small\ndivergence still exists across domains. We propose a new transfer model called\nRandomized Transferable Machine (RTM) to handle such small divergence of\ndomains. Specifically, we work on the new source and target data learned from\nexisting feature-based transfer methods. The key idea is to enlarge source\ntraining data populations by randomly corrupting the new source data using some\nnoises, and then train a transfer model $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{M}}$ that performs\nwell on all the corrupted source data populations. In principle, the more\ncorruptions are made, the higher the probability of the new target data can be\ncovered by the constructed source data populations, and thus better transfer\nperformance can be achieved by $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{M}}$. An ideal case is with\ninfinite corruptions, which however is infeasible in reality.

Hence, training efficiency should be a\ncritical issue. In this paper, we propose a novel coarse-refined training\nframework named CoRe to speed up the training of BERT.

In the first phase, by\nintroducing fast attention mechanism and decomposing the large parameters in\nthe feed-forward network sub-layer, we construct a relaxed BERT model which has\nmuch less parameters and much lower model complexity than the original BERT, so\nthe relaxed model can be quickly trained. In the second phase, we transform the\ntrained relaxed BERT model into the original BERT and further retrain the\nmodel. Thanks to the desired initialization provided by the relaxed model, the\nretraining phase requires much less training steps, compared with training an\noriginal BERT model from scratch with a random initialization.

To resolve\nthis issue, we first reformulate the district heating network model through\nequivalent transformation and variable substitution.

We formulate the\nproblem as a finite-horizon Markov decision process that aims to maximize the\nenergy arbitrage and social welfare of the prosumer-based community. The\nadvance of the management scheme is that the optimal policy has a threshold\nstructure. The structure has an analytic form that can guide the energy storage\nto charge/discharge by comparing its current marginal value and the expected\nfuture marginal value.

This dissipation enhancement has been rationalized by invoking either a\ngeometrical confinement of the shear in the liquid phase, or the influence of\nthe interface viscosity. However, a precise localization of the dissipation,\nand its mechanism, at the bubble scale is still lacking. To this aim, we\nsimultaneously monitored the evolution of the local flow velocity, film\nthickness and surface tension of a five films assembly, induced by different\ncontrolled deformations. These measurements allow us to build local\nconstitutive relations for this foam elementary brick. We first show that, for\nour millimetric foam films, the main part of the film has a purely elastic,\nreversible behavior, thus ruling out the interface viscosity to explain the\nobserved dissipation. We then highlight a generic frustration at the menisci,\ncontrolling the interface transfer between neighbor films and resulting in the\nlocalization of a bulk shear flow close to the menisci. A model accounting for\nsurfactant transport in these small sheared regions is developed.

We\nextend the theoretical understanding of the galaxy bispectrum by incorporating\na consistent general relativistic model of galaxy bias at second order, in the\npresence of local primordial non-Gaussianity. The influence of primordial\nnon-Gaussianity on the bispectrum extends beyond the galaxy bias and the dark\nmatter density, due to redshift-space effects. The standard redshift-space\ndistortions at first and second order produce a well-known primordial\nnon-Gaussian imprint on the bispectrum. Relativistic corrections to\nredshift-space distortions generate new contributions to this primordial\nnon-Gaussian signal, arising from: (1)~a coupling of first-order\nscale-dependent bias with first-order relativistic observational effects, and\n(2)~linearly evolved non-Gaussianity in the second-order velocity and metric\npotentials which appear in relativistic observational effects. Our analysis\nallows for a consistent separation of the relativistic `contamination' from the\nprimordial signal, in order to avoid biasing the measurements by using an\nincorrect theoretical model.

However, the precise nature of the Moon's\naccretional history remains enigmatic. There exists a significant mismatch of\nHSE budgets between the Earth and Moon, with the Earth disproportionally\naccreted far more HSEs than the Moon did. Several scenarios have been proposed\nto explain this conundrum, including the delivery of HSEs to Earth by a few big\nimpactors, the accretion of pebble-sized objects on dynamically cold orbits\nthat enhanced the Earth's gravitational focusing factor, and the \"sawtooth\nmodel\" with much reduced impact flux before ~4.10 Gyr. However, most of these\nmodels assume a high impactor retention ratio f (fraction of impactor mass\nretained on the target) for the Moon. Here, we performed a series of impact\nsimulations to quantify the f-value, followed by a Monte Carlo procedure\nenacting a monotonically decaying impact flux, to compute the mass accreted\ninto lunar crust and mantle over their histories. We found that the average\nf-value for the Moon's entire impact history is about 3 times lower than\npreviously estimated. Our results indicate that, to match the HSE budget of\nlunar crust and mantle, the retention of HSEs should have started ~ 4.35 Gyr\nago, when most of lunar magma ocean was solidified. Mass accreted prior to 4.35\nGyr must have lost its HSE to the lunar core, presumably during the lunar\nmantle crystallization. The combination of a low impactor retention ratio and a\nlate retention of HSEs in the lunar mantle provide a realistic explanation for\nthe apparent deficit of Moon's late accreted mass relative to the Earth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Nov 2020 11:45:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-30"}

Although several\nscenarios have been proposed to explain these asymmetries, their origin remains\ndebated. Recent remote sensing observations suggest that (1) the crust on the\nfarside highlands consists of two layers: a primary anorthositic layer with\nthickness of ~30-50 km and on top a more mafic-rich layer ~10 km thick; and (2)\nthe nearside exhibits a large area of low-Ca pyroxene that has been interpreted\nto have an impact origin. These observations support the idea that the lunar\nnearside-farside asymmetries may be the result of a giant impact. Here, using\nquantitative numerical modeling, we test the hypothesis that a giant impact on\nthe early Moon can explain the striking differences in elevation, crustal\nthickness, and composition between the nearside and farside of the Moon. We\nfind that a large impactor, impacting the current nearside with a low velocity,\ncan form a mega-basin and reproduce the characteristics of the crustal\nasymmetry and structures comparable to those observed on the current Moon,\nincluding the nearside lowlands and the farside's mafic-rich layer on top of a\nprimordial anorthositic crust. Our model shows that the excavated deep-seated\nKREEP (potassium, rare-earth elements, and phosphorus) material, deposited\nclose to the basin rim, slumps back into the basin and covers the entire basin\nfloor; subsequent large impacts can transport the shallow KREEP material to the\nsurface, resulting in its observed distribution. In addition, our model\nsuggests that prior to the asymmetry-forming impact, the Moon may have had an\n182W anomaly compared to the immediate post-giant impact Earth's mantle, as\npredicted if the Moon was created through a giant collision with the\nproto-Earth.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Nov 2020 11:54:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-30"}

However, establishing the degree of quiescence in\nhigh redshift galaxies is a challenging task. One notable example is Hyde, a\nrecently discovered galaxy at z=3.709. As compact (r~0.5 kpc) and massive\n(M*~1e11 Msun) as its quenched neighbor Jekyll, it is also extremely obscured\nyet only moderately luminous in the sub-millimeter. Panchromatic modeling\nsuggested it could be the first galaxy found in transition to quenching at z>3,\nhowever the data were also consistent with a broad range of star-formation\nactivity, including moderate SFR in the lower scatter of the galaxy\nmain-sequence (MS). Here, we describe ALMA observations of the [CII] 157um and\n[NII] 205um far-infrared emission lines. The [CII] emission within the\nhalf-light radius is dominated by ionized gas, while the outskirts are\ndominated by PDRs or neutral gas. This suggests that the ionization in the\ncenter is not primarily powered by on-going star formation, and could come\ninstead from remnant stellar populations formed in an older burst, or from a\nmoderate AGN. Accounting for this information in the multi-wavelength modeling\nprovides a tighter constraint on the star formation rate of\nSFR=$50^{+24}_{-18}$ Msun/yr. This rules out fully quenched solutions, and\nfavors SFRs more than factor of two lower than expected for a galaxy on the MS,\nconfirming the nature of Hyde as a transition galaxy. Theses results suggest\nthat quenching happens from inside-out, and starts before the galaxy expels or\nconsumes all its gas reservoirs. Similar observations of a larger sample would\ndetermine whether this is an isolated case or the norm for quenching at\nhigh-redshift.

However, standard VAE training is not possible in this case, which has\nmotivated different strategies to manipulate discrete distributions in order to\ntrain discrete VAEs similarly to conventional ones. Here we ask if it is also\npossible to keep the discrete nature of the latents fully intact by applying a\ndirect discrete optimization for the encoding model. The approach is\nconsequently strongly diverting from standard VAE-training by sidestepping\nsampling approximation, reparameterization trick and amortization. Discrete\noptimization is realized in a variational setting using truncated posteriors in\nconjunction with evolutionary algorithms. For VAEs with binary latents, we (A)\nshow how such a discrete variational method ties into gradient ascent for\nnetwork weights, and (B) how the decoder is used to select latent states for\ntraining. Conventional amortized training is more efficient and applicable to\nlarge neural networks. However, using smaller networks, we here find direct\ndiscrete optimization to be efficiently scalable to hundreds of latents. More\nimportantly, we find the effectiveness of direct optimization to be highly\ncompetitive in `zero-shot' learning. In contrast to large supervised networks,\nthe here investigated VAEs can, e.g., denoise a single image without previous\ntraining on clean data and/or training on large image datasets. More generally,\nthe studied approach shows that training of VAEs is indeed possible without\nsampling-based approximation and reparameterization, which may be interesting\nfor the analysis of VAE-training in general.

The approach allows\nconvenient handles to systematically vary the inter-pillar gap distances down\nto sub-10 nm regime. The results show compelling trends of the impact of\nanalyte dimensions in relation to the gap distances towards their leverage over\ninter-pillar hot-spots, and the resulting sensitivity in SERS based molecular\nassays. Comparing the detection of labelled proteins in surface-enhanced Raman\nand metal-enhanced Fluorescence configurations further reveal the relative\nadvantage of Fluorescence over Raman detection while encountering the spatial\nlimitations imposed by the gaps.

The measurements of hysteresis curves indicate that Ag doped ZrO2\ncompounds exhibit hysteresis loops with a coercivity of around 1350 Oe.\nMoreover, increase in Ag concentration resulted increase in the value of\nsaturation magnetization (MS); the maximum value of MS was recorded as 0.01\n{\\mu}B/Ag ion for x= 0.06 sample.

The\nscattering and refraction is thought to be due to fluctuations in electron\ndensity caused by turbulence. Hence, determining the true radio source size can\nprovide information on the turbulence in coronal plasma. However, the lack of\nhigh spatial resolution radio interferometric observations at low frequencies,\nsuch as with the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR), has made it difficult to\ndetermine the true radio source size and level of radio wave scattering. Here\nwe directly fit the visibilities of a LOFAR observation of a Type IIIb radio\nburst with an elliptical Gaussian to determine its source size and position.\nThis circumvents the need to image the source and then de-convolve LOFAR's\npoint spread function, which can introduce spurious effects to the source size\nand shape.

Variations in the magnitude of this\neffect lead to an additional source of red noise in pulsar timing experiments,\nincluding pulsar timing arrays that aim to detect nanohertz gravitational\nwaves.\n  We aim to quantify the time-variable dispersion with much improved precision\nand characterise the spectrum of these variations.\n  We use the pulsar timing technique to obtain highly precise dispersion\nmeasure (DM) time series. Our dataset consists of observations of 36\nmillisecond pulsars, which were observed for up to 7.1 years with the LOFAR\ntelescope at a centre frequency of ~150 MHz. Seventeen of these sources were\nobserved with a weekly cadence, while the rest were observed at monthly\ncadence.\n  We achieve a median DM precision of the order of 10^-5 cm^-3 pc for a\nsignificant fraction of our sources. We detect significant variations of the DM\nin all pulsars with a median DM uncertainty of less than 2x10^-4 cm^-3 pc. The\nnoise contribution to pulsar timing experiments at higher frequencies is\ncalculated to be at a level of 0.1-10 us at 1.4 GHz over a timespan of a few\nyears, which is in many cases larger than the typical timing precision of 1 us\nor better that PTAs aim for. We found no evidence for a dependence of DM on\nradio frequency for any of the sources in our sample.\n  The DM time series we obtained using LOFAR could in principle be used to\ncorrect higher-frequency data for the variations of the dispersive delay.\nHowever, there is currently the practical restriction that pulsars tend to\nprovide either highly precise times of arrival (ToAs) at 1.4 GHz or a high DM\nprecision at low frequencies, but not both, due to spectral properties.\nCombining the higher-frequency ToAs with those from LOFAR to measure the\ninfinite-frequency ToA and DM would improve the result.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Nov 2020 14:09:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-04"}

Since the degradation level changes\ndynamically during the system's operation, we face a dynamic maintenance\nscheduling problem. In this paper, we address the dynamic maintenance\nscheduling of manufacturing systems based on their degradation level. The\nmanufacturing system consists of several units with a defined capacity and an\nindividual dynamic degradation model, seeking to optimize their reward. The\nunits sell their production capacity, while maintaining the systems based on\nthe degradation state to prevent failures. The manufacturing units are jointly\nresponsible for fulfilling the demand of the system. This induces a coupling\nconstraint among the agents. Hence, we face a large-scale mixed-integer dynamic\nmaintenance scheduling problem. In order to handle the dynamic model of the\nsystem and large-scale optimization, we propose a distributed algorithm using\nmodel predictive control (MPC) and Benders decomposition method. In the\nproposed algorithm, first, the master problem obtains the maintenance\nscheduling for all the agents, and then based on this data, the agents obtain\ntheir optimal production using the distributed MPC method which employs the\ndual decomposition approach to tackle the coupling constraints among the\nagents. The effectiveness of the proposed method is investigated on a case\nstudy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Nov 2020 14:10:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-30"}

Especially when it comes to the realm of Internet of Things, the UAVs\nwith Internet connectivity are one of the main demands. Furthermore, the energy\nconstraint i.e. battery limit is a bottle-neck of the UAVs that can limit their\napplications. We try to address and solve the energy problem. Therefore, a path\nplanning method for a cellular-connected UAV is proposed that will enable the\nUAV to plan its path in an area much larger than its battery range by getting\nrecharged in certain positions equipped with power stations (PSs). In addition\nto the energy constraint, there are also no-fly zones; for example, due to Air\nto Air (A2A) and Air to Ground (A2G) interference or for lack of necessary\nconnectivity that impose extra constraints in the trajectory optimization of\nthe UAV. No-fly zones determine the infeasible areas that should be avoided. We\nhave used a reinforcement learning (RL) hierarchically to extend typical\nshort-range path planners to consider battery recharge and solve the problem of\nUAVs in long missions. The problem is simulated for the UAV that flies over a\nlarge area, and Q-learning algorithm could enable the UAV to find the optimal\npath and recharge policy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Nov 2020 14:16:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-30"}

We find that the stellar ages for the bulk of\nthe GALAH DR3 sample are accurate to 1-2 Gyr using this method. With these\nages, we replicate many recent results on the age-kinematic trends of the\nnearby disk, including the age-velocity dispersion relationship of the solar\nneighborhood and the larger global velocity dispersion relations of the disk\nfound using $Gaia$ and GALAH. The fact that chemical abundances alone can be\nused to determine a reliable age for a star have profound implications for the\nfuture study of the Galaxy as well as upcoming spectroscopic surveys. These\nresults show that the chemical abundance variation at a given birth radius is\nquite small, and imply that strong chemical tagging of stars directly to birth\nclusters may prove difficult with our current elemental abundance precision.\nOur results highlight the need of spectroscopic surveys to deliver precision\nabundances for as many nucleosynthetic production sites as possible in order to\nestimate reliable ages for stars directly from their chemical abundances.\nApplying the methods outlined in this paper opens a new door into studies of\nthe kinematic structure and evolution of the disk, as ages may potentially be\nestimated for a large fraction of stars in existing spectroscopic surveys. This\nwould yield a sample of millions of stars with reliable age determinations, and\nallow precise constraints to be put on various kinematic processes in the disk,\nsuch as the efficiency and timescales of radial migration.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Nov 2020 14:18:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-30"}

A highly successful\ndesign strategy in materials chemistry involves controlling these individual\ndistortions to produce useful functional responses. In a ferroelectric such as\nlead titanate, for example, the key degree of freedom involves displacements of\nPb$^{2+}$; by coupling these together, the system interacts with electric\nfields. An exciting development has been to exploit the interplay between\ndifferent distortions: $e.g.$ generating polarisation by combining different\npolyhedral rotations. Thus, degrees of freedom act as geometric `elements' that\ncan be combined to engineer materials with interesting properties. Just as the\ndiscovery of new elements diversified chemical space, identifying new types of\nstructural degrees of freedom is a key strategy for developing new functional\nmaterials. In this context, molecular frameworks are a fertile source of\nunanticipated distortion types, many of which have no parallel in conventional\nsolid-state chemistry. Framework materials are solids whose structures are\nassembled from nodes and linkers to form scaffolding-like networks. These\nstructures usually contain cavities, which may host additional ions for charge\nbalance. In the well-established systems---such as lead titanate---these\ncomponents are all atomic, but in molecular frameworks, at least one ion is\nmolecular. Here, we survey the unconventional degrees of freedom introduced\nthrough the replacement of atoms by molecules. Our motivation is to understand\nthe role these new distortions play in different materials properties. The\nvarious degrees of freedom are summarised and described in the context of\nexperimental examples. We highlight a number of directions for future research,\nwhich demonstrate the extraordinary possibilities for this nascent field.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 27 Nov 2020 14:57:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-30"}

A widely accepted fact about cognitive\ncontrol is that it is context-sensitive: Adults and children alike infer\ninformation about a task's demands from contextual cues and use these\ninferences to learn from ambiguous cues. However, the precise way in which\npeople use contextual cues to guide adaptation to a new task remains poorly\nunderstood.

We\nbegin by identifying an essential difference between human learning and current\napproaches to meta-learning: In contrast to humans, existing meta-learning\nalgorithms do not make use of task-specific contextual cues but instead rely\nexclusively on online feedback in the form of task-specific labels or rewards.\nTo remedy this, we introduce a framework for using contextual information about\na task to guide the initialization of task-specific models before adaptation to\nonline feedback. We show how context-conditioned meta-learning can capture\nhuman behavior in a cognitive task and how it can be scaled to improve the\nspeed of learning in various settings, including few-shot classification and\nlow-sample reinforcement learning.

The proposed method makes the feature\nextraction of spherical interpolated convolution network more rational and\neffective. The effectiveness of the proposed network is demonstrated on the 3D\nsemantic segmentation task of point clouds.

This is a two-valued analogue of the\nclassical Bernstein theorem, which asserts that in dimensions up to $n+1 \\leq\n8$, an entire single-valued minimal graph is linear. The main contrast with the\nsingle-valued theory is the presence of a large set of singularities in the\ngraphs of two-valued functions.

The\ngauge transformations commonly used for fields, are extended to include the\ntransformation of the metrics. A list is given of available experimental\nevidences not easy to be interpreted, at present, by means of the more\nestablished models, such as the standard model with its variants aimed at\novercoming its descriptive limits; these evidences could be candidates to\nverify the predictions stemming from the mentioned properties of the Deformed\nMinkowski space. Concrete opportunities are suggested for an experimental\nexploration of phenomena, either already performed but still lacking a widely\naccepted explanation, or conceivable in application of the approach here\npresented, but not tackled until now. A tentative list is given with reference\nto experimental infrastructures already in operation, the performances of which\ncan be expanded with limited additional resources.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 26 Nov 2020 19:29:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-03"}

Due to the nature of MANETs, P2P mobile systems brought up many new\nthriving challenges, in particular with regard to the content discovery issue.\nThus, the design of an efficient content discovery protocol has been of\nparamount importance. The thriving challenge is to (i) locate relevant peers\nsharing pertinent resources for users queries and then (ii) to ensure that\nthose peers would be reached by considering different MANET constraints (e.g.,\npeer mobility, battery energy, peer load, to cite a few).
