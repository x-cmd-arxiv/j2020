Cleaning methods rely on the frequency smoothness\nof the foregrounds and are often applied under the assumption of a simplistic\nGaussian primary beam. In this work, we test the cleaning in the presence of a\nrealistic primary beam model with a non trivial frequency dependence. We focus\non the Square Kilometre Array precursor MeerKAT telescope and simulate a\nsingle-dish wide area survey. We consider the main foreground components,\nincluding an accurate full sky point source catalogue. We find that the\ncoupling between beam sidelobes and the foreground structure can complicate the\ncleaning. However, when the beam frequency dependence is smooth, we show that\nthe cleaning is only problematic if the far sidelobes are unexpectedly large.\nEven in that case, a proper reconstruction is possible if the strongest point\nsources are removed and the cleaning is more aggressive. We then consider a\nnon-trivial frequency dependence: a sinusoidal type feature in the beam width\nthat is present in the MeerKAT beam and is expected in most dishes, including\nSKA1-MID. Such a feature, coupling with the foreground emission, biases the\nreconstruction of the signal across frequency, potentially impacting the\ncosmological analysis. Interestingly, such contamination is present at a lower\nlevel even when no point sources are included and the beam is Gaussian, showing\nthat this frequency ripple can be problematic even within the main lobe.

We also demonstrate that cosine similarity and word\nmover's distance are sensitive enough to detect ambiguity in its most subtle\nliterary form, despite doubts to the contrary raised by literary scholars. Our\nanalysis is built on topic word lists and word embeddings from various sources.\nWe first claim, and then empirically show, the interdependence between\ncomputational analysis and close reading performed by a human expert.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Nov 2020 17:53:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-24"}

It is shown that the effective\npotential of such a system is an example of a fold catastrophe. In fact, the\nexistence of a local minimum and saddle point, corresponding to tidally-locked\ncircular orbits, is regulated by a single dimensionless control parameter which\ndepends on the properties of the two bodies and on the total angular momentum\nof the system. The method described in this work results in compact expressions\nfor the radius of the circular orbit and the tidally-locked spin/orbital\nfrequency. The limiting case in which one of the two orbiting objects is\npoint-like is studied in detail. An analysis of the effective potential, which\nin this limit depends on only two parameters, allows one to clearly visualize\nthe properties of the system. The notorious case of the Mars' moon Phobos is\npresented as an example of a satellite that is past the no return point and,\ntherefore, will not reach a stable or unstable tidally-locked orbit.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Nov 2020 17:58:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-24"}

However, this transform gives a poor reconstruction of the FDF because\nof the instrument's limited wavelength coverage.

In this work, we focus on a certain channel model known as the\ndelay-doppler channel.

Moreover, the delay-doppler model then continues to\nbe applicable even when using signals of large bandwidth, which is a standard\napproach to achieving high resolution channel estimation. However, when high\nresolution is desirable, this standard approach results in a tension with the\ndesire for efficiency because, in particular, it immediately implies that the\nsignals in play live in a space of very high dimension $N$ (e.g., ~$10^6$ in\nsome applications), as per the Shannon-Nyquist sampling theorem.\n  To address this difficulty, we propose a novel randomized estimation scheme\ncalled Sparse Channel Estimation, or SCE for short, for channel estimation in\nthe $k$-sparse setting (e.g., $k$ objects in radar detection). This scheme\ninvolves an estimation procedure with sampling and space complexity both on the\norder of $k(logN)^3$, and arithmetic complexity on the order of $k(log N)^3 +\nk^2$, for $N$ sufficiently large.\n  To the best of our knowledge, Sparse Channel Estimation (SCE) is the first of\nits kind to achieve these complexities simultaneously -- it seems to be\nextremely efficient! As an added advantage, it is a simple combination of three\ningredients, two of which are well-known and widely used, namely digital chirp\nsignals and discrete Gaussian filter functions, and the third being recent\ndevelopments in sparse fast fourier transform algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Nov 2020 18:59:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-24"}

In deep data hiding models, to\nmaximize the encoding capacity, each pixel of the cover image ought to be\ntreated differently since they have different sensitivities w.r.t. visual\nquality. The neglecting to consider the sensitivity of each pixel inevitably\naffects the model's robustness for information hiding. In this paper, we\npropose a novel deep data hiding scheme with Inverse Gradient Attention (IGA),\ncombining the idea of attention mechanism to endow different attention weights\nfor different pixels. Equipped with the proposed modules, the model can\nspotlight pixels with more robustness for data hiding.

While there has been a\nsignificant amount of research on defending against such attacks, most defenses\nbased on systematic design principles have been defeated by appropriately\nmodified attacks. For a fixed set of data, the most effective current defense\nis to train the network using adversarially perturbed examples. In this paper,\nwe investigate a radically different, neuro-inspired defense mechanism,\nstarting from the observation that human vision is virtually unaffected by\nadversarial examples designed for machines. We aim to reject L^inf bounded\nadversarial perturbations before they reach a classifier DNN, using an encoder\nwith characteristics commonly observed in biological vision: sparse\novercomplete representations, randomness due to synaptic noise, and drastic\nnonlinearities. Encoder training is unsupervised, using standard dictionary\nlearning. A CNN-based decoder restores the size of the encoder output to that\nof the original image, enabling the use of a standard CNN for classification.\nOur nominal design is to train the decoder and classifier together in standard\nsupervised fashion, but we also consider unsupervised decoder training based on\na regression objective (as in a conventional autoencoder) with separate\nsupervised training of the classifier. Unlike adversarial training, all\ntraining is based on clean images.\n  Our experiments on the CIFAR-10 show performance competitive with\nstate-of-the-art defenses based on adversarial training, and point to the\npromise of neuro-inspired techniques for the design of robust neural networks.\nIn addition, we provide results for a subset of the Imagenet dataset to verify\nthat our approach scales to larger images.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Nov 2020 21:03:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 21 Dec 2020 23:35:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-23"}

However,\ncurrent research in the field mainly focuses on tracking of opaque objects,\nwhile little attention is paid to transparent object tracking.

Specifically, TOTB consists of 225 videos\n(86K frames) from 15 diverse transparent object categories. Each sequence is\nmanually labeled with axis-aligned bounding boxes. To the best of our\nknowledge, TOTB is the first benchmark dedicated to transparent object\ntracking. In order to understand how existing trackers perform and to provide\ncomparison for future research on TOTB, we extensively evaluate 25\nstate-of-the-art tracking algorithms.

A recently developed mean-field (MF) theory\npredicts the characteristic exponents of these distributions in the limit of\nvery high spatial dimension, $d\\rightarrow\\infty$ and, remarkably, their values\nseemingly agree with numerical estimates in physically relevant dimensions,\n$d=2$ and $3$. These exponents are further connected through a pair of\ninequalities derived from stability conditions, and both theoretical\npredictions and previous numerical investigations suggest that these\ninequalities are saturated. Systems at the jamming point are thus only\nmarginally stable. Despite the key physical role played by these exponents,\ntheir systematic evaluation has yet to be attempted. Here, we carefully test\ntheir value by analyzing the finite-size scaling of the distributions of $f$\nand $h$ for various particle-based models for jamming. Both dimension and the\ndirection of approach to the jamming point are also considered. We show that,\nin all models, finite-size effects are much more pronounced in the distribution\nof $h$ than in that of $f$. We thus conclude that gaps are correlated over\nconsiderably longer scales than forces. Additionally, remarkable agreement with\nMF predictions is obtained in all but one model, namely near-crystalline\npackings. Our results thus help to better delineate the domain of the jamming\nuniversality class. We furthermore uncover a secondary linear regime in the\ndistribution tails of both $f$ and $h$.

In addition, mmWave\nsensing has superior reliability compared to other sensing counterparts such as\ncamera and LiDAR, which is essential for safety-critical driving. Therefore, it\nis critical to understand the security vulnerabilities and improve the security\nand reliability of mmWave sensing in AVs. To this end, we perform the\nend-to-end security analysis of a mmWave-based sensing system in AVs, by\ndesigning and implementing practical physical layer attack and defense\nstrategies in a state-of-the-art mmWave testbed and an AV testbed in real-world\nsettings. Various strategies are developed to take control of the victim AV by\nspoofing its mmWave sensing module, including adding fake obstacles at\narbitrary locations and faking the locations of existing obstacles. Five\nreal-world attack scenarios are constructed to spoof the victim AV and force it\nto make dangerous driving decisions leading to a fatal crash. Field experiments\nare conducted to study the impact of the various attack scenarios using a\nLincoln MKZ-based AV testbed, which validate that the attacker can indeed\nassume control of the victim AV to compromise its security and safety. To\ndefend the attacks, we design and implement a challenge-response authentication\nscheme and a RF fingerprinting scheme to reliably detect aforementioned\nspoofing attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Nov 2020 06:01:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-24"}

Such systems admit a distribution\nof solutions, which is (partially) characterized by the single-time joint\nprobability density function (PDF) of system states. It can be used to\ncalculate such information-theoretic quantities as the mutual information\nbetween the stochastic stimulus and various internal states of the neuron\n(e.g., membrane potential), as well as various spiking statistics. When random\nexcitations are modeled as Gaussian white noise, the joint PDF of neuron states\nsatisfies exactly a Fokker-Planck equation. However, most biologically\nplausible noise sources are correlated (colored). In this case, the resulting\nPDF equations require a closure approximation. We propose two methods for\nclosing such equations: a modified nonlocal large-eddy-diffusivity closure and\na data-driven closure relying on sparse regression to learn relevant features.\nThe closures are tested for the stochastic non-spiking leaky integrate-and-fire\nand FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) neurons driven by sine-Wiener noise. Mutual\ninformation and total correlation between the random stimulus and the internal\nstates of the neuron are calculated for the FHN neuron.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Nov 2020 06:47:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 7 Sep 2021 19:13:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-09"}

Here we use digital image correlation on coarse-grained\n$\\alpha$-uranium during tensile testing in conjunction with crystal plasticity\nfinite element simulations. This approach allows us to determine the critical\nresolved shear stress, and hardening rate of the different slip and twin\nsystems. The constitutive model is based on dislocation densities as state\nvariables and the simulated geometry is constructed from electron backscatter\ndiffraction images that provide shape, size and orientation of the grains,\nallowing a direct comparison between virtual and real experiments. An\noptimisation algorithm is used to find the model parameters that reproduce the\nevolution of the average strain in each grain as the load is increased. A\ntensile bar, containing four grains aligned with the load direction, is used to\ncalibrate the model with eight unknown parameters. The approach is then\nindependently validated by simulating the strain distribution in a second\ntensile bar. Different mechanisms for the hardening of the twin systems are\nevaluated. The latent hardening of the most active twin system turns out to be\ndetermined by coplanar twins and slip. The hardening rate of the most active\nslip system is lower than in fine-grained $\\alpha$-uranium. The method\ndeveloped in the present research can be applied to identify the critical\nresolved shear stress and hardening parameters of other coarse-grained\nmaterials.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Nov 2020 06:52:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-24"}

Due to the discrepancy of\naction selection between training and inference, the agent solely on the basis\nof imitation learning does not perform well. Sampling the next action from its\npredicted probability distribution during the training process allows the agent\nto explore diverse routes from the environments, yielding higher success rates.\nNevertheless, without being presented with the shortest navigation paths during\nthe training process, the agent may arrive at the target location through an\nunexpected longer route.

We add learnable 2D offsets to 3D convolution which aims to\nsample locations on spatial feature maps across frames. The offsets can be\nlearned for specific tasks. The \\emph{LS3D-Conv} can flexibly replace 3D\nconvolution layers in existing 3D networks and get new architectures, which\nlearns the sampling at multiple feature levels. The experiments on video\ninterpolation, video super-resolution, video denoising, and action recognition\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Nov 2020 09:20:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-24"}

We focus on the complexity of finding a p-ordering\ngiven a prime p, an exponent k and a subset of integers modulo p^k.\n  Our first algorithm gives a p-ordering for set of size n in time O(nk\\log p),\nwhere set is considered modulo p^k.

A\nnatural technique to compute such high dimensional integrals is to resort to\nMonte Carlo simulations. However these techniques generally suffer from a high\nvariance in the low temperature regime, because the expectation is often\ndominated by high values corresponding to rare system trajectories. A standard\nway to reduce the variance of the estimator is to modify the drift of the\ndynamics with a control enhancing the probability of rare event, leading to\nso-called importance sampling estimators. In theory, the optimal control leads\nto a zero-variance estimator; it is however defined implicitly and computing it\nis of the same difficulty as the original problem. We propose here a general\nstrategy to build approximate optimal controls in the small temperature limit\nfor diffusion processes, with the first goal to reduce the variance of free\nenergy Monte Carlo estimators.

Theoretical\ndispersion analysis and numerical simulations are performed to reveal\ntransmission behaviors of elastic wave in the presented piezoelectric\nmetastructure. It is uncovered that, when the one-way electrical coupling\nfeature is introduced, local-resonance bandgaps are maintained in opposite\ndirections of the piezoelectric metastructure. However, the bandgap attenuation\ncapability in one direction is increased compared to conventional\nlocal-resonance metastructures, in which no electrical coupling exists between\ncells, while that in the other direction is decreased. Therefore, nonreciprocal\ntransmission of elastic wave emerges in this system due to the distinct bandgap\nattenuation capability. It is also revealed that this sort of nonreciprocal\nwave attenuation capability is adaptive with the one-way electrical coupling\ncoefficient and the resistance of electrical cells. An experimental set-up of\nthe piezoelectric metastructure is built and experimental results verify the\nnonreciprocity property and its adaptiveness.

However, these\nbenchmarks---such as ILSVRC---are relatively task-specific, focusing\npredominately on predicting class labels. We introduce a publicly-available\ndataset that embodies the task-general capabilities of human perception and\nreasoning. The Human Similarity Judgments extension to ImageNet (ImageNet-HSJ)\nis composed of human similarity judgments that supplement the ILSVRC validation\nset. The new dataset supports a range of task and performance metrics,\nincluding the evaluation of unsupervised learning algorithms. We demonstrate\ntwo methods of assessment: using the similarity judgments directly and using a\npsychological embedding trained on the similarity judgments. This embedding\nspace contains an order of magnitude more points (i.e., images) than previous\nefforts based on human judgments. Scaling to the full 50,000 image set was made\npossible through a selective sampling process that used variational Bayesian\ninference and model ensembles to sample aspects of the embedding space that\nwere most uncertain. This methodological innovation not only enables scaling,\nbut should also improve the quality of solutions by focusing sampling where it\nis needed. To demonstrate the utility of ImageNet-HSJ, we used the similarity\nratings and the embedding space to evaluate how well several popular models\nconform to human similarity judgments. One finding is that more complex models\nthat perform better on task-specific benchmarks do not better conform to human\nsemantic judgments. In addition to the human similarity judgments, pre-trained\npsychological embeddings and code for inferring variational embeddings are made\npublicly available. Collectively, ImageNet-HSJ assets support the appraisal of\ninternal representations and the development of more human-like models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Nov 2020 13:41:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-24"}

At the same time, it is also an extremely challenging task\ndue to the following reasons: First, there exists a wide variety of video game\ngenres, many of which are not concretely defined. Second, video game covers\nvary in many different ways such as colors, styles, textual information, etc,\neven for games of the same genre. Third, cover designs and textual descriptions\nmay vary due to many external factors such as country, culture, target reader\npopulations, etc. With the growing competitiveness in the video game industry,\nthe cover designers and typographers push the cover designs to its limit in the\nhope of attracting sales. The computer-based automatic video game genre\nclassification systems become a particularly exciting research topic in recent\nyears. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal deep learning framework to solve\nthis problem. The contribution of this paper is four-fold. First, we compiles a\nlarge dataset consisting of 50,000 video games from 21 genres made of cover\nimages, description text, and title text and the genre information. Second,\nimage-based and text-based, state-of-the-art models are evaluated thoroughly\nfor the task of genre classification for video games. Third, we developed an\nefficient and salable multi-modal framework based on both images and texts.\nFourth, a thorough analysis of the experimental results is given and future\nworks to improve the performance is suggested. The results show that the\nmulti-modal framework outperforms the current state-of-the-art image-based or\ntext-based models. Several challenges are outlined for this task. More efforts\nand resources are needed for this classification task in order to reach a\nsatisfactory level.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Nov 2020 22:31:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-25"}

Any\noverestimation of the dynamic thermal line rating (DTLR) can lead to lifetime\ndegradation and failure of OHLs, safety hazards, etc. This paper presents a\nsecure yet sharp probabilistic prediction model for the hour-ahead forecasting\nof the DTLR. The security of the proposed DTLR limits the frequency of DTLR\nprediction exceeding the actual DTLR. The model is based on an augmented deep\nlearning architecture that makes use of a wide range of predictors, including\nhistorical climatology data and latent variables obtained during DTLR\ncalculation. Furthermore, by introducing a customized cost function, the deep\nneural network is trained to consider the DTLR security based on the required\nprobability of exceedance while minimizing deviations of the predicted DTLRs\nfrom the actual values. The proposed probabilistic DTLR is developed and\nverified using recorded experimental data. The simulation results validate the\nsuperiority of the proposed DTLR compared to state-of-the-art prediction models\nusing well-known evaluation metrics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 21 Nov 2020 23:20:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-26"}

Our proposed model is capable\nof coping with the key challenge of colon apparent heterogeneity caused by\nseveral types of diseases. Our model is driven by attention-based deep multiple\ninstance learning and is trained end-to-end on weakly labeled data using video\nlabels instead of detailed frame-by-frame annotation. The spatial and temporal\nfeatures are obtained through ResNet50 and residual Long short-term memory\n(residual LSTM) blocks, respectively. Additionally, the learned temporal\nattention module provides the importance of each frame to the final label\nprediction. Moreover, we developed a self-supervision method to maximize the\ndistance between classes of pathologies. We demonstrate through qualitative and\nquantitative experiments that our proposed weakly supervised learning model\ngives superior precision and F1-score reaching, 61.6% and 55.1%, as compared to\nthree state-of-the-art video analysis methods respectively. We also show our\nmodel's ability to temporally localize frames with pathologies, without frame\nannotation information during training.
