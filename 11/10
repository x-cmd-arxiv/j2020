ABC\nparameter estimation requires the ability to forward simulate datasets from a\ncandidate model, but because the sizes of the observed and simulated datasets\nusually need to match, this can be computationally expensive. Additionally,\nsince ABC inference is based on comparisons of summary statistics computed on\nthe observed and simulated data, using computationally expensive summary\nstatistics can lead to further losses in efficiency. ABC has recently been\napplied to the family of mechanistic network models, an area that has\ntraditionally lacked tools for inference and model choice. Mechanistic models\nof network growth repeatedly add nodes to a network until it reaches the size\nof the observed network, which may be of the order of millions of nodes. With\nABC, this process can quickly become computationally prohibitive due to the\nresource intensive nature of network simulations and evaluation of summary\nstatistics. We propose two methodological developments to enable the use of ABC\nfor inference in models for large growing networks. First, to save time needed\nfor forward simulating model realizations, we propose a procedure to\nextrapolate (via both least squares and Gaussian processes) summary statistics\nfrom small to large networks. Second, to reduce computation time for evaluating\nsummary statistics, we use sample-based rather than census-based summary\nstatistics. We show that the ABC posterior obtained through this approach,\nwhich adds two additional layers of approximation to the standard ABC, is\nsimilar to a classic ABC posterior. Although we deal with growing network\nmodels, both extrapolated summaries and sampled summaries are expected to be\nrelevant in other ABC settings where the data are generated incrementally.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Nov 2020 16:13:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-10"}

This article studies the geometric and structural properties\nof the Cayley graphs of finitely presented special monoids, building on work by\nZhang and Gray-Steinberg. It is shown that the right Cayley graph $\\Gamma$ of a\nspecial monoid $M$ is a context-free graph, in the sense of Muller & Schupp, if\nand only if the group of units of $M$ is virtually free. This generalises the\ngeometric aspect of the well-known Muller-Schupp Theorem from groups to special\nmonoids. Furthermore, we completely characterise when the monadic second order\ntheory of $\\Gamma$ is decidable: this is precisely when the group of units is\nvirtually free.

These criteria are based on two requirements.\nFirst, the invariance of the vacuum under the symmetries of the Dirac equations\nin the considered spacetime. Second, the unitary implementability of the\nHeisenberg dynamics of the annihilation and creation operators when the curved\nspacetime is treated as a fixed background. This last requirement not only\npermits the uniqueness of the Fock quantization but, remarkably, it also\ndetermines an essentially unique splitting between the phase space variables\nassigned to the background and the fermionic annihilation and creation\nvariables. We first consider Dirac fields in cosmological spacetimes of 2+1\ndimensions and then discuss the more relevant case of 3+1 dimensions. We use\nthis analysis to investigate the hybrid loop quantization of a flat\nFriedmann-Lema\\^itre-Robertson-Walker background cosmology coupled to a\nperturbative Dirac field. Among the Fock quantizations for the fermionic\nperturbations allowed by our criteria, we further restrict the choice of vacuum\nby demanding a finite fermionic backreaction and, moreover, by diagonalizing\nthe fermionic contribution to the total Hamiltonian in the asymptotic limit of\nlarge wave numbers of the Dirac modes. Finally, we argue in support of the\nuniquess of the vacuum state selected by the extension of this diagonalization\ncondition beyond the ultraviolet regime, proving that it picks out the standard\nPoincar\\'e and Bunch-Davies vacua for fixed flat and de Sitter background\nspacetimes, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Nov 2020 16:49:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Jun 2021 06:08:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-02"}

Hence,\na highly efficient simulation method is needed to evaluate the performance of\ndifferent hybrid memory system designs.

While\nexisting distributed design methods confine attention to the decentralized or\ndistributed information structures, this study addresses distributed design of\nglocal-structured controllers. Glocal control exploits the nature that network\nsystem's behavior can typically be represented as a superposition of spatially\nlocal fluctuations and global interarea oscillations by incorporating a global\ncoordinating subcontroller with local decentralized subcontrollers. The key\nidea to distributed design of glocal controllers is to represent the original\nnetwork system as a hierarchical cascaded system composed of reduced-order\nmodels representing the global and local dynamics, referred to as hierarchical\nmodel decomposition. Distributed design is achieved by independently designing\nand implementing subcontrollers for the reduced-order models while preserving\nthe cascade structure. This paper provides a condition for existence of the\nhierarchical model decomposition, a specific representation of the hierarchical\nsystem, a clustering method appropriate for the proposed approach, and a robust\nextension.

Our main result shows that context-bounded fair termination is\ndecidable for the model; context-bounded implies that each spawned thread can\nbe context switched a fixed constant number of times. Our proof is technical,\nsince fair termination requires reasoning about the composition of unboundedly\nmany threads each with unboundedly large stacks. In fact, techniques for\nrelated problems, which depend crucially on replacing the pushdown threads with\nfinite-state threads, are not applicable. Instead, we introduce an extension of\nvector addition systems with states (VASS), called VASS with balloons (VASSB),\nas an intermediate model; it is an infinite-state model of independent\ninterest. A VASSB allows tokens that are themselves markings (balloons). We\nshow that context bounded fair termination reduces to fair termination for\nVASSB.

Given a graph, edge costs, and a set of dedicated vertices\n(terminals), the Steiner tree problem asks to output a sub-graph that connects\nall terminals at minimum cost. A state-of-the-art algorithm to solve the\nSteiner tree problem by means of dynamic programming is the Dijkstra-Steiner\nalgorithm. The algorithm builds a Steiner tree of the entire instance by\nsystematically searching for smaller instances, based on subsets of the\nterminals, and combining Steiner trees for these smaller instances. The search\nheavily relies on a guiding heuristic function in order to prune the search\nspace. However, to ensure correctness, this algorithm allows only for limited\nheuristic functions, namely, those that satisfy a so-called consistency\ncondition. In this paper, we enhance the Dijkstra-Steiner algorithm and\nestablish a revisited algorithm, called DS*. The DS* algorithm allows for\narbitrary lower bounds as heuristics relaxing the previous condition on the\nheuristic function. Notably, we can now use linear programming based lower\nbounds. Further, we capture new requirements for a heuristic function in a\ncondition, which we call admissibility. We show that admissibility is indeed\nweaker than consistency and establish correctness of the DS* algorithm when\nusing an admissible heuristic function. We implement DS* and combine it with\nmodern preprocessing, resulting in an open-source solver (DS* Solve).

These\napplications raised the interest of the community for theoretical properties of\nthis type of codes, such as the hardness of decoding in rank metric. Among\nclassical problems associated to codes for a given metric, the notion of code\nequivalence (to decide if two codes are isometric) has always been of the\ngreatest interest, for its cryptographic applications or its deep connexions to\nthe graph isomorphism problem.\n  In this article, we discuss the hardness of the code equivalence problem in\nrank metric for $\\mathbb{F}_{q^m}$-linear and general rank metric codes. In the\n$\\mathbb{F}_{q^m}$-linear case, we reduce the underlying problem to another one\ncalled {\\em Matrix Codes Right Equivalence Problem}. We prove the latter\nproblem to be either in $\\mathcal{P}$ or in $\\mathcal{ZPP}$ depending of the\nground field size. This is obtained by designing an algorithm whose principal\nroutines are linear algebra and factoring polynomials over finite fields. It\nturns out that the most difficult instances involve codes with non trivial {\\em\nstabilizer algebras}. The resolution of the latter case will involve tools\nrelated to finite dimensional algebras and Wedderburn--Artin theory.

Such cores have long been thought to\nform through `binary scouring' as supermassive black holes (SMBHs), brought in\nthrough mergers, form a hard binary and eject stars from the galactic centre.\nHowever, the most massive cores, like the ~3kpc core in A2261-BCG, remain\nchallenging to explain in this way. In this paper, we run a suite of dry galaxy\nmerger simulations to explore three different scenarios for central core\nformation in massive elliptical galaxies: `binary scouring', `tidal deposition'\nand `gravitational wave (GW) induced recoil'. Using the Griffin code, we\nself-consistently model the stars, dark matter and SMBHs in our merging\ngalaxies, following the SMBH dynamics through to the formation of a hard\nbinary. We find that we can only explain the large surface brightness core of\nA2261-BCG with a combination of a major merger that produces a small ~1kpc core\nthrough binary scouring, followed by the subsequent GW recoil of its SMBH that\nacts to grow the core size. We show that this same model can also explain the\nbright `knots' observed in the core region of A2261-BCG. Key predictions of\nthis scenario are an offset SMBH surrounded by a compact cluster of bound stars\nand a non-divergent central density profile.

An important example is measuring the top-quark\nmass, where other physical and unphysical parameters in the simulation must be\nmarginalized over when fitting the top-quark mass parameter. We compare three\ndifferent methodologies for top-quark mass measurement: a classical histogram\nfitting procedure, similar to one commonly used in experiment optionally\naugmented with soft-drop jet grooming; a machine-learning method called DCTR;\nand a linear regression approach, either using a least-squares fit or with a\ndense linearly-activated neural network.

We provide an analytic\nexpression for the grasp, and also show that in the background-dominated noise\nlimit, the optimal exposure time is three times the dead time. We introduce a\nrelated metric we call the information-content grasp, which summarizes the\nvariance of all sources observed by the telescope per unit time. For\nseeing-dominated sky surveys, in terms of grasp, etendue, or collecting-area\noptimization, recent technological advancements make it more cost effective to\nconstruct multiple small telescopes rather than a single large telescope with a\nsimilar grasp or etendue. Among these key advancements are the availability of\nlarge-format back-side illuminated CMOS detectors with <4 micron pixels, well\nsuited to sample standard seeing conditions given typical focal lengths of\nsmall fast telescopes. We also discuss the possible use of multiple small\ntelescopes for spectroscopy.

However, as shown\nin Refs. \\cite{Hill:2020osr,Ivanov:2020ril} the cosmic microwave background\n(CMB) and large-scale structure (LSS) data impose tight constraints on this\nproposal. Here, we revisit these strong bounds considering the Planck CMB\ntemperature anisotropy data at large angular scales and the SPTPol polarization\nand lensing measurements. As advocated in Ref. \\cite{Chudaykin:2020acu}, this\ncombined data approach predicts the CMB lensing effect consistent with the\n$\\Lambda$CDM expectation and allows one to efficiently probe both large and\nsmall angular scales. Combining Planck and SPTPol CMB data with the full-shape\nBOSS likelihood and information from photometric LSS surveys in the EDE\nanalysis we found for the Hubble constant $H_0=69.79\\pm0.99\\,{\\rm\nkm\\,s^{-1}Mpc^{-1}}$ and for the EDE fraction $f_{\\rm EDE}<0.094\\,(2\\sigma)$.\nThese bounds obtained without including a local distance ladder measurement of\n$H_0$ (SH0ES) alleviate the Hubble tension to a $2.5\\sigma$ level.

We also found\nthat a higher value of $H_0$ does not significantly deteriorate the fit to the\nLSS data. Overall, the EDE scenario is (though weakly) favoured over\n$\\Lambda$CDM even after accounting for unconstrained directions in the\ncosmological parameter space. We conclude that the large-scale Planck\ntemperature and SPTPol polarization measurements along with LSS data do not\nrule out the EDE model as a resolution of the Hubble tension.

By varying temperature and dimensionality, we\ncan tune between settings with and without symmetry breaking and accompanying\ncollective modes or quasiparticles. We analyse both conventional and\nout-of-time-ordered spin correlators (`decorrelators') to track the spreading\nof a spatiotemporally localised perturbation -- the wingbeat of the butterfly\n-- as well as transport coefficients and Lyapunov exponents. We identify a\nnumber of qualitatively different regimes. Trivially, at $T=0$, there is no\ndynamics at all. In the limit of low temperature, $T=0^+$, integrability\nemerges, with infinitely long-lived magnons; here the wavepacket created by the\nperturbation propagates ballistically, yielding a lightcone at the spin wave\nvelocity which thus subsumes the butterfly velocity; inside the lightcone, a\npattern characteristic of the free spin wave spectrum is visible at short\ntimes. On top of this, residual interactionslead to spin wave lifetimes which,\nwhile divergent in this limit, remain finite at any nonzero $T$. At the longest\ntimes, this leads to a `standard' chaotic regime; for this regime, we show that\nthe Lyapunov exponent is simply proportional to the inverse spin-wave lifetime.\nVisibly strikingly, between this and the `short-time' integrable regimes, a\nscarred regime emerges: here, the decorrelator is spatiotemporally highly\nnon-uniform, being dominated by rare and random scattering events seeding\nsecondary lightcones. As the spin correlation length decreases with increasing\n$T$, the distinction between these regimes disappears and at high temperature\nthe previously studied chaotic paramagnetic regime emerges. For this, we\nelucidate how, somewhat counterintuitively, the ballistic butterfly velocity\narises from a diffusive spin dynamics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Nov 2020 19:24:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-12"}

Such macroscopic degeneracy is in general highly\nsensitive to perturbations, such that even slight perturbation lifts the\ndegeneracy and leads to various interesting physical phenomena.\n  In this thesis, we develop an approach to identify and construct FB\nHamiltonians in 1D, 2D Hermitian, and 1D non-Hermitian systems. First, we\nintroduce a systematic classification of FB lattices by their CLS properties,\nand propose a scheme to generate tight-binding Hamiltonians having FBs with\ngiven CLS properties---a FB generator. Applying this FB generator to a 1D\nsystem, we identify all possible FB Hamiltonians of 1D lattices with arbitrary\nnumbers of bands and CLS sizes. Extending the 1D approach, we establish a FB\ngenerator for 2D FB Hamiltonians that have CLSs occupying a maximum of four\nunit cells in a $2\\times2$ plaquette. Employing this approach in the\nnon-Hermitiaon regime, we realize a FB generator for a 1D non-Hermitian lattice\nwith two bands. Ultimately, we apply our methods to propose a tight-binding\nmodel that explains the spectral properties of a microwave photonic crystal.\n  Our results and methods in this thesis further our understanding of the\nproperties of FB lattices and their CLSs, provide more flexibility to design FB\nlattices in experiments, and open new avenues for future research.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Nov 2020 19:39:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-11"}

To leverage such\nsimilarity in annotation space across languages, we propose a method called\nCross-Lingual Argument Regularizer (CLAR).

With\nthis natural action space for learning locomotion, the approach is more sample\nefficient and produces desired task space dynamics compared to learning purely\njoint space actions.

Current sampling-based\nmethods such as Rapidly Exploring Random Trees (RRTs) are not ideal for this\nproblem because of the high computational cost. Supervised learning methods\nsuch as Imitation Learning lack generalization and safety guarantees. To\naddress these problems and in order to ensure a robust framework, we propose a\nHierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) structure combined with a\nProportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller for trajectory planning. HRL\nhelps divide the task of autonomous vehicle driving into sub-goals and supports\nthe network to learn policies for both high-level options and low-level\ntrajectory planner choices. The introduction of sub-goals decreases convergence\ntime and enables the policies learned to be reused for other scenarios. In\naddition, the proposed planner is made robust by guaranteeing smooth\ntrajectories and by handling the noisy perception system of the ego-car.

FOXSI is\nthe first solar-dedicated instrument to utilize focusing optics to image the\nSun in the hard X-ray (HXR) regime, sensitive to the energy range 4-20 keV.\nThrough spectral analysis of the two microflares using an optically thin\nisothermal plasma model, we find evidence for plasma heated to temperatures of\n~10 MK and emissions measures down to ~$10^{44}~$cm$^{-3}$. Though nonthermal\nemission was not detected for the FOXSI-2 microflares, a study of the parameter\nspace for possible hidden nonthermal components shows that there could be\nenough energy in nonthermal electrons to account for the thermal energy in\nmicroflare 1, indicating that this flare is plausibly consistent with the\nstandard thick-target model. With a solar-optimized design and improvements in\nHXR focusing optics, FOXSI-2 offers approximately five times greater\nsensitivity at 10 keV than the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR)\nfor typical microflare observations and allows for the first direct imaging\nspectroscopy of solar HXRs with an angular resolution at scales relevant for\nmicroflares. Harnessing these improved capabilities to study the evolution of\nsmall-scale events, we find evidence for spatial and temporal complexity during\na sub-A class flare. These studies in combination with contemporanous\nobservations by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly onboard the Solar Dynamics\nObservatory (SDO/AIA) indicate that the evolution of these small microflares is\nmore similar to that of large flares than to the single burst of energy\nexpected for a nanoflare.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Nov 2020 20:55:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-02"}

In\nparticular, an inner bound is obtained for the $K$-receiver discrete memoryless\n(DM) BC for the diamond message set which consists of four groupcast messages:\none desired by all receivers, one by all but two receivers, and two more\ndesired by all but each one of those two receivers. The inner bound is based on\nrate-splitting and superposition coding and is given in explicit form herein as\na union over coding distributions of four-dimensional polytopes. When\nspecialized to the so-called combination network, which is a class of\nthree-layer (two-hop) broadcast networks parameterized by $2^K-1$\nfinite-and-arbitrary-capacity noiseless links from the source node in the first\nlayer to as many nodes of the second layer, our top-down approach from the DM\nBC to the combination network yields an explicit inner bound as a single\npolytope via the identification of a single coding distribution. This inner\nbound consists of inequalities which are then identified to be within the class\nof a plethora of (indeed, infinitely many) generalized cut-set outer bounds\nrecently obtained by Salimi et al for broadcast networks. We hence establish\nthe capacity region of the general $K$-user combination network for the diamond\nmessage set, and do so in explicit form. Such a result implies a certain\nstrength of our inner bound for the DM BC in that it (a) produces a hitherto\nunknown capacity region when specialized to the combination network and (b) may\ncapture many combinatorial aspects of the capacity region of the $K$-receiver\nDM BC itself (for the diamond message set). Moreover, we further extend that\ninner bound by adding binning to it and providing that inner bound also in\nexplicit form as a union over coding distributions of four-dimensional\npolytopes in the message rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Nov 2020 21:00:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-11"}

A crucial component of NPCs is navigation, which allows them to\nmove from one point to another on the map. The most popular approach for NPC\nnavigation in the video game industry is to use a navigation mesh (NavMesh),\nwhich is a graph representation of the map, with nodes and edges indicating\ntraversable areas. Unfortunately, complex navigation abilities that extend the\ncharacter's capacity for movement, e.g., grappling hooks, jetpacks,\nteleportation, or double-jumps, increases the complexity of the NavMesh, making\nit intractable in many practical scenarios.

Specifically, these properties are discreteness of the spectrum\n(BD), self-adjointness, oscillation ($i$th solution has $i$ zeros) and that the\n$i$th eigenvalue equals the SFA delta value (the total energy) of the $i$th\nsolution.

We continue our study of the imprint\nof a thermonuclear explosion on the SNR it produces, that we started with a\ndelayed-detonation model of a Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf. Here we compare\ntwo different types of explosion models, each with two variants: two delayed\ndetonation models (N100ddt, N5ddt) and two pure deflagration models (N100def,\nN5def), where the N number parametrizes the ignition. The output of each SN\nsimulation is used as input of a SNR simulation carried on until 500 yr after\nthe explosion. While all SNR models become more spherical over time and overall\ndisplay the theoretical structure expected for a young SNR, clear differences\nare visible amongst the models, depending on the geometry of the ignition and\non the presence or not of detonation fronts. Compared to N100 models, N5 models\nhave a strong dipole component, and produce asymmetric remnants. N5def produces\na regular-looking, but offset remnant, while N5ddt produces a two-sided\nremnant. Pure deflagration models exhibit specific traits: a central\nover-density, because of the incomplete explosion, and a network of seam lines\nacross the surface, boundaries between burning cells. Signatures from the SN\ndominate the morphology of the SNR up to 100 yr to 300 yr after the explosion,\ndepending on the model, and are still measurable at 500 yr, which may provide a\nway of testing explosion models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 9 Nov 2020 21:12:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-20"}

However, for many practical planning problems in robotics, we\nexpect the robot to predict goals, e.g. from noisy sensors or by generalizing\nlearned models to novel contexts.

While a few works have used\nprobability distributions as goals for planning, surprisingly no systematic\ntreatment of planning to goal distributions exists in the literature.

It can be strongly time-dependent because either exposure incidence\nor excess risk may change over time. Competing events may moreover hinder the\noutcome of interest from being observed. Occurrence of either of these events\nmay, in turn, prevent the exposure of interest. Estimation approaches therefore\nneed to carefully account for the timing of potential events in such highly\ndynamic settings. The use of multistate models has been widely encouraged to\nmeet this need so as to eliminate preventable yet common types of\ntime-dependent bias, such as immortal time bias. Even so, it has been pointed\nout that previously proposed multistate modeling approaches for PAF estimation\nfail to fully eliminate such biases. In addition, assessing whether patients\ndie from rather than with a certain exposure, not only requires adequate\nmodeling of the timing of events, but also of their confounding factors. While\nproposed multistate modeling approaches for confounding adjustment may be\nsufficient to accommodate baseline imbalances between infected and uninfected\npatients, unlike g-methods, these proposals are not generally equipped to\nhandle time-dependent confounding. However, the connection between multistate\nmodeling and g-methods (e.g. inverse probability of censoring weighting) for\nPAF estimation is not readily apparent. In this paper, we illustrate this\nconnection by means of a weighting-based characterization of both approaches.\nThis characterization aids to both pinpoint current shortcomings of these\napproaches and to enhance intuition into simple modifications to overcome these\nlimitations.

In this study, we numerically and theoretically\ninvestigate the dispersion of an initially localized patch of passive elongated\nBrownian particles constrained to one degree of rotational freedom in a\ntwo-dimensional Poiseuille flow, demonstrating that elongated particles exhibit\nan enhanced longitudinal dispersion. In a shear flow, the rods translate due to\nadvection and diffusion and rotate due to rotational diffusion and their\nclassical Jeffery's orbit. The magnitude of the enhanced dispersion depends on\nthe particle's aspect ratio and the relative importance of its shear-induced\nrotational advection and rotational diffusivity. When rotational diffusion\ndominates, we recover the classical Taylor dispersion result for the\nlongitudinal spreading rate using an orientationally averaged translational\ndiffusivity for the rods. However, in the high-shear limit, the rods tend to\nalign with the flow and ultimately disperse more due to their anisotropic\ndiffusivities. Results from our Monte Carlo simulations of the particle\ndispersion are captured remarkably well by a simple theory inspired by Taylor's\noriginal work. For long times and large Peclet numbers, an effective\none-dimensional transport equation is derived with integral expressions for the\nparticles' longitudinal transport speed and dispersion coefficient.

Prior works have shown that using computer vision techniques to\nidentify smoke is a low cost and convenient method. However, industrial smoke\ndetection is a challenging task because industrial emission particles are often\ndecay rapidly outside the stacks or facilities and steam is very similar to\nsmoke. To overcome these problems, a novel Spatio-Temporal Cross Network\n(STCNet) is proposed to recognize industrial smoke emissions. The proposed\nSTCNet involves a spatial pathway to extract texture features and a temporal\npathway to capture smoke motion information. We assume that spatial and\ntemporal pathway could guide each other. For example, the spatial path can\neasily recognize the obvious interference such as trees and buildings, and the\ntemporal path can highlight the obscure traces of smoke movement. If the two\npathways could guide each other, it will be helpful for the smoke detection\nperformance. In addition, we design an efficient and concise spatio-temporal\ndual pyramid architecture to ensure better fusion of multi-scale spatiotemporal\ninformation. Finally, extensive experiments on public dataset show that our\nSTCNet achieves clear improvements on the challenging RISE industrial smoke\ndetection dataset against the best competitors by 6.2%.

A key\ntopic is the interaction of alphas with perturbations to the tokamak fields,\nincluding those from ripple and magnetohydrodynamic modes like Alfv\\'{e}n\neigenmodes. These perturbations can transport alphas, leading to changed\nlocalization of alpha heating, loss of alpha power, and damage to device walls.\nAlpha interaction with these perturbations is often studied with single\nparticle theory. In contrast, we derive a drift kinetic theory to calculate the\nalpha heat flux resulting from arbitrary perturbation frequency and periodicity\n(provided these can be studied drift kinetically). Novel features of the theory\ninclude the retention of a large effective collision frequency resulting from\nthe resonant alpha collisional boundary layer, correlated interactions over\nmany poloidal transits, and finite orbit effects.

The TAE heat flux is significant and scales with\nthe square of the perturbation amplitude, allowing the derivation of\nconstraints on mode amplitude for avoidance of significant alpha depletion.

In this work, we\ndemonstrate the catalytic effect of surface-embedded nitrogen in nucleating new\nlayers of (100) diamond. To do so we develop a model of nitrogen overgrowth\nusing density functional theory. Nucleation of new layers occurs through C\ninsertion into a C--C surface dimer. However, we find that C insertion into a\nC--N dimer has substantially reduced energy requirements. In particular, the\nrate of the key dimer ring-opening and closing mechanism is increased 400-fold\nin the presence of nitrogen. Full incorporation of the substitutional nitrogen\ndefect is then facilitated through charge transfer of an electron from the\nnitrogen lone pair to charge acceptors on the surface. This work provides a\ncompelling mechanism for the role of surface-embedded nitrogen in enhancing\n(100) diamond growth through the nucleation of new layers. Furthermore, it\ndemonstrates a pathway for substitutional nitrogen formation during chemical\nvapour deposition which can be extended to study the creation of\ntechnologically relevant nitrogen-based defects.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Nov 2020 06:02:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-11"}

In this paper, we propose expressing desired high-level\nrobot behavior using a formal specification language known as Signal Temporal\nLogic (STL) as an alternative to reward/cost functions. We use STL\nspecifications in conjunction with model-based learning to design model\npredictive controllers that try to optimize the satisfaction of the STL\nspecification over a finite time horizon. The proposed algorithm is empirically\nevaluated on simulations of robotic system such as a pick-and-place robotic\narm, and adaptive cruise control for autonomous vehicles.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Nov 2020 07:31:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-11"}

Machine learning libraries tend to be updated periodically, which\nmay deprecate existing APIs, making it necessary for developers to update their\nusages. However, updating usages of deprecated APIs are typically not a\npriority for developers, leading to widespread usages of deprecated APIs which\nexpose library users to vulnerability issues. In this paper, we built a tool to\nautomate these updates. We first conducted an empirical study to seek a better\nunderstanding on how updates of deprecated machine-learning API usages in\nPython can be done. The study involved a dataset of 112 deprecated APIs from\nScikit-Learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. We found dimensions of deprecated API\nmigration related to its update operation (i.e., the required operation to\nperform the migration), API mapping (i.e., the number of deprecated and its\ncorresponding updated APIs),and context dependency (i.e., whether we need to\nconsider surrounding contexts when performing the migration). Guided by the\nfindings on our empirical study, we created MLCatchUp, a tool to automate the\nupdate of Python deprecated API usage that automatically infers the API\nmigration transformation through comparison of the deprecated and updated API\nsignatures. These transformations are expressed in a Domain Specific Language\n(DSL). We evaluated MLCatchUp using test dataset containing 258 files with 514\nAPI usages that we collected from public GitHub repositories. In this\nevaluation, MLCatchUp achieves a precision of 86.19%.

Experiments with retinas from bull frogs\nare performed to compare with the predictions of the NGD model. In particulars,\nwhole field stochastic stimulation with various time correlations are used to\nprobe anticipatory responses from the retina. We find that the NGD model can\nreproduce essential features of experimental observations characterized by the\ncross correlations between the stimulation and the retinal responses. The\nprediction horizon of a retina is found to depend on the correlation time of\nthe stimulation as predicted by the NGD model. Experiments with dark and bright\nGaussian light pulses further support the NGD mechanism; but only for the dark\npulses indicating that the NGD effect of a retina might originate from its OFF\nresponse. Our finding suggests that sensory systems capable of using negative\nfeedback for adaptation can give rise to anticipation as a consequence of the\ndelay in the system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Nov 2020 08:22:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-10"}

However, there are many\nto choose from, and an important question is which is most suited to what\nsituation.\n  This paper presents the Eithne framework, designed to simplify benchmarking\nof micro-core architectures. Three benchmarks, LINPACK, DFT and FFT, have been\nimplemented atop of this framework and we use these to explore the key\ncharacteristics and concerns of common micro-core designs within the context of\noperating on the edge for disaster detection. The result of this work is an\nextensible framework that the community can use help develop and test these\ndevices in the future.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Nov 2020 09:04:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-11"}

Preliminary\nanalysis of the experimental data was performed by employing contact $n$-$n$\ninteractions, which are known to underestimate the $s$-wave content in other\nhalo nuclei such as $^{11}$Li. In the present work, the three-body\nhyperspherical formalism with finite-range two-body interactions is used to\ndescribe $^{19}$B. In particular, two different finite-range $n$-$n$\ninteractions will be used, as well as a simple central Gaussian potential whose\nrange is progressively reduced. The purpose is to determine the main properties\nof the nucleus and investigate how they change when using contact-like $n$-$n$\npotentials. Special attention is also paid to the dependence on the\nprescription used to account for three-body effects, i.e., a three-body force\nor a density-dependent $n$-$n$ potential. We have found that the three-body\nmodel plus finite-range potentials provide a description of $^{19}$B consistent\nwith the experimental data. The results are essentially independent of the\nshort-distance details of the two-body potentials, giving rise to an\n$(s_{1/2})^2$ content of about 55%, clearly larger than the initial estimates.\nVery little dependence has been found as well on the prescription used for the\nthree-body effects. The total computed $B(E1)$ strength is compatible with the\nexperimental result, although we slightly overestimate the data around the\nlow-energy peak of the $dB(E1)/d\\varepsilon$ distribution. Finally, we show\nthat a reduction of the $n$-$n$ interaction range produces a significant\nreduction of the $s$-wave contribution, which then should be expected in\ncalculations using contact interactions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Nov 2020 09:24:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2020 10:38:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-02"}

Here, we report the discovery with\nSwift of a sequence of bright and rapid X-ray flare events that reveal the\nemergence of Mrk 335 from its ultra-deep multiyear low state. Results are based\non our dedicated multiyear monitoring with Swift. Unlike other bright AGN, the\noptical-UV is generally not correlated with the X-rays in Mrk 335 on a\ntimescale of days to months. This fact either implies the absence of a direct\nlink between the two emission components; or else implies that the observed\nX-rays are significantly affected by (dust-free) absorption along our l.o.s.\nThe UV and optical, however, are closely correlated at the 99.99 percent\nconfidence level. The UV is leading the optical by delta t = 1.5+/-1.5 d. The\nSwift X-ray spectrum shows strong deviations from a single power law in all\nbrightness states of the outbursts, indicating that significant absorption or\nreprocessing is taking place. Mrk 335 displays a softer-when-brighter\nvariability pattern at intermediate X-ray levels, which has been seen in our\nSwift data since 2007 (based on a total of 590 observations). This pattern\nbreaks down at the highest and lowest count rates. We interpret the 2020\nbrightening of Mrk 335 as a decrease in column density and covering factor of a\npartial-covering absorber along our line of sight in form of a clumpy\naccretion-disk wind that reveals an increasing portion of the intrinsic\nemission of Mrk 335 from the disk and/or corona region, while the optical\nemission-line regions receive a less variable spectral energy distribution.\nThis then also explains why Mrk 335 was never seen to change its optical\nSeyfert type (not 'changing look') despite its factor 50 X-ray variability with\nSwift.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Nov 2020 09:27:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-18"}

To this end, this paper proposes\nChannel-Exchanging-Network (CEN), a parameter-free multimodal fusion framework\nthat dynamically exchanges channels between sub-networks of different\nmodalities. Specifically, the channel exchanging process is self-guided by\nindividual channel importance that is measured by the magnitude of\nBatch-Normalization (BN) scaling factor during training. The validity of such\nexchanging process is also guaranteed by sharing convolutional filters yet\nkeeping separate BN layers across modalities, which, as an add-on benefit,\nallows our multimodal architecture to be almost as compact as a unimodal\nnetwork.

The burst mode of star formation scenario\nproposes that the stars grow in mass via episodic accretion of fragments\nmigrating from their gravitationally-unstable circumstellar discs and it\nnaturally explains the existence of observed pre-main-sequence bursts from high\nmass protostars. We present a parameter study of hydrodynamical models of\nmassive young stellar objects (MYSOs) that explores the initial masses of the\ncollapsing clouds (Mc = 60-200Mo) and ratio of rotational-to-gravitational\nenergies (beta = 0:005-0:33). An increase in Mc and/or beta produces\nprotostellar accretion discs that are more prone to develop gravitational\ninstability and to experience bursts. We find that all MYSOs have bursts even\nif their pre-stellar core is such that beta <= 0.01. Within our assumptions,\nthe lack of stable discs is therefore a major difference between low- and\nhigh-mass star formation mechanisms. All our disc masses and disk-to-star mass\nratios Md=M* > 1 scale as a power-law with the stellar mass. Our results\nconfirm that massive protostars accrete about 40-60% of their mass in the burst\nmode. The distribution of time periods between two consecutive bursts is\nbimodal: there is a short duration (~ 1-10 yr) peak corresponding to the short,\nfaintest bursts and a long duration peak (at ~ 10^3-10^4 yr) corresponding to\nthe long, FU-Orionis-type bursts appearing in later disc evolution, i.e.,\naround 30 kyr after disc formation. We discuss this bimodality in the context\nof the structure of massive protostellar jets as potential signatures of\naccretion burst history.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Nov 2020 10:17:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-25"}

CocciEvolve is the state-of-the-art approach for\nthis automation.

Among them, the most popular contract models are the on-demand and\nthe spot models. In the former, on-demand VMs are allocated for a fixed cost\nper time unit, and their availability is ensured during the whole execution. On\nthe other hand, in the spot market, VMs are offered with a huge discount when\ncompared to the on-demand VMs, but their availability fluctuates according to\nthe cloud's current demand that can terminate or hibernate a spot VM at any\ntime. Furthermore, in order to cope with workload variations, cloud providers\nhave also introduced the concept of burstable VMs which are able to burst up\ntheir respective baseline CPU performance during a limited period of time with\nan up to 20% discount when compared to an equivalent non-burstable on-demand\nVMs. In the current work, we present the Burst Hibernation-Aware Dynamic\nScheduler (Burst-HADS), a framework that schedules and executes tasks of\nBag-of-Tasks applications with deadline constraints by exploiting spot and\non-demand burstable VMs, aiming at minimizing both the monetary cost and the\nexecution time. Based on ILS metaheuristics, Burst-HADS defines an initial\nscheduling map of tasks to VMs which can then be dynamically altered by\nmigrating tasks of a hibernated spot VM or by performing work-stealing when VMs\nbecome idle. Performance results on Amazon EC2 cloud with different\napplications show that, when compared to a solution that uses only regular\non-demand instances, Burst-HADS reduces the monetary cost of the execution and\nmeet the application deadline even in scenarios with high spot hibernation\nrates. It also reduces the total execution time when compared to a solution\nthat uses only spot and non-burstable on-demand instances.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Nov 2020 11:08:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-11"}

In this paper, we propose to leverage intelligent reflecting surface\n(IRS) to achieve fast yet reliable model aggregation for AirComp-based FL. To\noptimize the learning performance, we formulate an optimization problem that\njointly optimizes the device selection, the aggregation beamformer at the base\nstation (BS), and the phase shifts at the IRS to maximize the number of devices\nparticipating in the model aggregation of each communication round under\ncertain mean-squared-error (MSE) requirements. To tackle the formulated\nhighly-intractable problem, we propose a two-step optimization framework.\nSpecifically, we induce the sparsity of device selection in the first step,\nfollowed by solving a series of MSE minimization problems to find the maximum\nfeasible device set in the second step. We then propose an alternating\noptimization framework, supported by the difference-of-convex-functions\nprogramming algorithm for low-rank optimization, to efficiently design the\naggregation beamformers at the BS and phase shifts at the IRS. Simulation\nresults will demonstrate that our proposed algorithm and the deployment of an\nIRS can achieve a lower training loss and higher FL prediction accuracy than\nthe baseline algorithms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Nov 2020 11:29:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Nov 2020 01:41:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-01"}

A local function of density accounts for the mechanical state of\nthe fluid. Viewed as a non-equilibrium free energy functional of number density\nand polarization, minimization in these two densities under constraints of the\nMaxwell field equations should lead the correct equilibrium state. The\nalternative is a continuum mechanics approach in which the mechanical degree of\nfreedom is extended to full deformation. We show that the continuum\nelectromechanics method leads to a force balance equation which is consistent\nwith the density functional equilibrium equation. The continuum mechanics\nprocedure is significantly more demanding. The gain is a well defined pressure\ntensor derived from deformation of total energy.

It is necessary to evaluate the\ncollective potential and the collective inertia along a fission path for a\ndescription of quantum tunneling in spontaneous or low-energy fission. In past\nstudies of the fission dynamics based on nuclear energy density functional\n(EDF) theory, the collective inertia has been evaluated with the cranking\napproximation, which neglects dynamical residual effects. Purpose: The purpose\nis to provide a reliable and efficient method to include dynamical residual\neffects in the collective inertia for fission dynamics. Methods: We use the\nlocal quasiparticle random-phase approximation (LQRPA) to evaluate the\ncollective inertia along a fission path obtained by the constrained\nHartree-Fock-Bogoliubov method with the Skyrme EDF. The finite-amplitude method\n(FAM) with a contour integration technique enables us to efficiently compute\nthe collective inertia in a large model space. Results: We evaluate the\nFAM-QRPA collective inertia along a symmetric fission path in $^{240}$Pu and\n$^{256}$Fm. The FAM-QRPA inertia is significantly larger than the one of the\ncranking approximation, and shows pronounced peaks around the ground state and\nthe fission isomer. This is due to dynamical residual effects. Conclusions: To\ndescribe the spontaneous or low-energy fission, we provide a reliable and\nefficient method to construct the collective inertia with dynamical residual\neffects that have been neglected in most of EDF-based works in the past. We\nshow the importance of dynamical residual effects to the collective inertia.\nThis work will be a starting point for a systematic study of fission dynamics\nin heavy and superheavy nuclei to microscopically describe the nuclear\nlarge-amplitude collective motions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Nov 2020 11:41:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-20"}

In the course of the researches, the model of user similarity\ncoefficients calculating for the recommendation systems has been improved. The\nmodel differs from the known ones in that it takes into account the\nrecalculation period of similarity coefficients for the individual user and\naverage recalculation period of similarity coefficients for all users of the\nsystem or a specific group of users.

Precision and Recall can\ndecrease slightly or increase, depending on the characteristics of the incoming\ndata set. The use of the proposed solutions will increase the application\nperiod of the previously calculated similarity coefficients of users for the\nprediction of preferences without their recalculation and, accordingly, it will\nshorten the time of formation and issuance of recommendation lists up to 2\ntimes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Nov 2020 11:49:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-11"}

Recently, much effort has been dedicated towards\nunderstanding how these methods behave in high-dimensional settings, where $d$\nand $n$ both increase to infinity together. This often leads to different\ninference procedures, depending on the assumptions about the dimensionality,\nleaving the practitioner in a bind: given a dataset with 100 samples in 20\ndimensions, should they calibrate by assuming $n \\gg d$, or $d/n \\approx 0.2$?\nThis paper considers the goal of dimension-agnostic inference; developing\nmethods whose validity does not depend on any assumption on $d$ versus $n$. We\nintroduce an approach that uses variational representations of existing test\nstatistics along with sample splitting and self-normalization to produce a\nrefined test statistic with a Gaussian limiting distribution, regardless of how\n$d$ scales with $n$.

Inspired by the success of neural networks, a line\nof research has been conducted to train GNNs to deal with various tasks, such\nas node classification, graph classification, and link prediction. In this\nwork, our task of interest is graph classification. Several GNN models have\nbeen proposed and shown great accuracy in this task. However, the question is\nwhether usual training methods fully realize the capacity of the GNN models.\n  In this work, we propose a two-stage training framework based on triplet\nloss. In the first stage, GNN is trained to map each graph to a Euclidean-space\nvector so that graphs of the same class are close while those of different\nclasses are mapped far apart. Once graphs are well-separated based on labels, a\nclassifier is trained to distinguish between different classes. This method is\ngeneric in the sense that it is compatible with any GNN model. By adapting five\nGNN models to our method, we demonstrate the consistent improvement in accuracy\nand utilization of each GNN's allocated capacity over the original training\nmethod of each model up to 5.4\\% points in 12 datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Nov 2020 13:47:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 12 Nov 2020 05:07:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 15 Feb 2021 05:34:15 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Fri, 8 Apr 2022 07:48:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-11"}

Collaborative filtering is\none of the most popular algorithms in these systems. The main purpose of\ncollaborative filtering is to find the users or the same items using the rating\nmatrix. By increasing the number of users and items, this algorithm suffers\nfrom the scalability problem. On the other hand, due to the unavailability of a\nlarge number of user preferences for different items, there is a cold start\nproblem for a new user or item that has a significant impact on system\nperformance. The purpose of this paper is to design a movie recommender system\nnamed TRSM-RS using users' demographic information (just users' gender) along\nwith the new weighted similarity measure. By segmenting users based on their\ngender, the scalability problem is improved, and by considering the reliability\nof the users' similarity as the weight in the new similarity measure (Tanimoto\nReliability Similarity Measure, TRSM), the effect of the cold-start problem is\nundermined and the performance of the system is improved.

While graphs offer a convenient\nframework for multiple real-world problems, their analytics still comes with\nhigh computation and space. By mapping the graph data into a low dimensional\nspace, in which graph structural information is preserved, the eigenvectors of\nthe Laplacian matrix constitute a powerful node embedding, called Laplacian\nEigenmaps. Computing these embeddings is on its own an expensive task knowing\nthat using specific sparse methods, the eigendecomposition of a Laplacian\nmatrix has a cost of O($rn^2$), $r$ being the ratio of nonzero elements.\n  We propose a method to compute a Laplacian Eigenmap using a quantum\nvariational circuit. The idea of our algorithm is to reach the eigenstates of\nthe laplacian matrix, which can be considered as a hamiltonian operator, by\nadapting the variational quantum eigensolver algorithm. By estimating the $d$\nfirst eigenvectors of the Laplacian at the same time, our algorithm directly\ngenerates a $d$ dimension quantum embedding of the graph. We demonstrate that\nit is possible to use the embedding for graph machine learning tasks by\nimplementing a quantum classifier on the top of it. The overall circuit\nconsists in a full quantum node classification algorithm. Tests on 32 nodes\ngraph with a quantum simulator shows that we can achieve similar performances\nas the classical laplacian eigenmap algorithm. Although mathematical properties\nof this approximate approach are not fully understood, this algorithm opens\nperspectives for graph pre-processing using noisy quantum computers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Nov 2020 14:51:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-11"}

Consequently, accurate measurements of hospital performance are\nessential for various decision-makers, including patients, hospital managers\nand health insurers. Hospital performance is assessed via the health outcomes\nof their patients. However, as the risk profiles of patients between hospitals\nvary, measuring hospital performance requires adjustment for patient risk. This\ntask is formalized in the state-of-the-art procedure through a hierarchical\ngeneralized linear model, that isolates hospital fixed-effects from the effect\nof patient risk on health outcomes. Due to the linear nature of this approach,\nany non-linear relations or interaction terms between risk variables are\nneglected.\n  In this work, we propose a novel method for measuring hospital performance\nadjusted for patient risk. This method captures non-linear relationships as\nwell as interactions among patient risk variables, specifically the effect of\nco-occurring health conditions on health outcomes. For this purpose, we develop\na tailored neural network architecture that is partially interpretable: a\nnon-linear part is used to encode risk factors, while a linear structure models\nhospital fixed-effects, such that the risk-adjusted hospital performance can be\nestimated.

We\nshow that the sole knowledge of first degree moments of the function, namely\nlinear measurements, is sufficient to obtain asymptotically all the other\nmoments by solving a hierarchy of semidefinite relax-ations (viewed as moment\nmatrix completion problems) with a specific sparsity inducing criterion related\nto a weighted 1-norm of the moment sequence of the measure. The resulting\nsequence of optimal solutions converges to the whole moment sequence of the\nmeasure which is shown to be the unique optimal solution of a certain\ninfinite-dimensional linear optimization problem (LP). Then one may recover the\nfunction by a recent extraction algorithm based on the Christoffel-Darboux\nkernel associated with the measure. Finally, the support of such a measure\nsupported on a graph is a meager, very thin (hence sparse) set. Therefore the\nLP on measures with this sparsity inducing criterion can be interpreted as an\nanalogue for infinite-dimensional signals of the LP in super-resolution for\n(sparse) atomic signals. In data science, it is often relevant to process\nmoments of a signal instead of the signal itself.

In numerical approximation\nalgorithms, many operations on real valued signals are more efficiently\nimplemented in their sequence of Chebyshev coefficients [19].

Based on the illumination\nstructures and point signals, a complex image is reconstructed by running a\nphase retrieval algorithm.

In the present article, I intend to recall the main aspects of his\nwork related to Wigner $3j$ symbols. It is well known that the latter can be\nexpressed with a hypergeometric series. The polynomial zeros of the $3j$\ncoefficients were initially characterized by the number of terms of the series\nminus one, which is the degree of the coefficient. A detailed study of the\nzeros of the $3j$ coefficient with respect to the degree $n$ for $J = a + b + c\n\\leq 240$ ($a$, $b$ and $c$ being the angular momenta in the first line of the\n$3j$ symbol) by Raynal revealed that most zeros of high degree had small\nmagnetic quantum numbers. This led him to define the order $m$ to improve the\nclassification of the zeros of the $3j$ coefficient. Raynal did a search for\nthe polynomial zeros of degree 1 to 7 and found that the number of zeros of\ndegree 1 and 2 are infinite, though the number of zeros of degree larger than 3\ndecreases very quickly as the degree increases. Based on Whipple's\ntransformations of hypergeometric $_3F_2$ functions with unit argument, Raynal\ngeneralized the Wigner $3j$ symbols to any arguments and pointed out that there\nare twelve sets of ten formulas (twelve sets of 120 generalized $3j$ symbols)\nwhich are equivalent in the usual case. In this paper, we also discuss other\naspects of the zeros of $3j$ coefficients, such as the role of Diophantine\nequations and powerful numbers, or the alternative approach involving Labarthe\npatterns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Nov 2020 15:34:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 2020 16:23:34 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 9 Mar 2021 07:41:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-10"}

Specifically, underwater\nand underground media are known to absorb electromagnetic radiation, which\nheavily affects the overall path loss. Industrial and disaster environments can\nbe viewed as rich scattering environments with corresponding substantial\nmultipath propagation leading to intersymbol interference and deterioration of\nsignal quality. Although the challenges for the design of communication\nnetworks, and specifically the Internet of Things (IoT), in such environments\nare known, there is no common enabler or solution for all these applications.\nReconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have been introduced to improve the\nsignal propagation characteristics by focusing the signal power in the\npreferred direction, thus making the communication environment 'smart'. While\nthe usual application of RIS is related to blockage avoidance, the very same\ntechnique can be used to reduce the effect of multipath and even partially\ncompensate the signal absorption via passive beamforming. Due to the beneficial\nproperties of RIS, its use in challenging environments can become the\naforementioned enabler and a game changing technology. In this paper, we\ndiscuss potential use cases, deployment strategies and design aspects for RIS\ndevices in underwater IoT, underground IoT as well as Industry 4.0 and\nemergency networks. Furthermore, we provide a potential hardware architecture\nand derive the expected signal quality. The numerical results reveal\nsubstantial performance gains of up to 20 dB per decade. In addition, novel\nresearch challenges to be addressed in this context are described.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Nov 2020 15:19:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 23 Feb 2021 10:20:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 22 Jun 2022 09:38:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-23"}

Despite this,\nfew N(2D) reactions have been studied over the appropriate low temperature\nrange. During the present work, rate constants were measured for the N(2D) +\nethene (C2H4) reaction using a supersonic flow reactor at temperatures between\n50 K and 296 K. Here, a chemical reaction was used to generate N(2D) atoms,\nwhich were detected directly by laser induced fluorescence in the vacuum\nultraviolet wavelength region. The measured rate constants displayed very\nlittle variation as a function of temperature, with substantially larger values\nthan those obtained in previous work. Indeed, considering an average\ntemperature of 170 K for the atmosphere of Titan leads to a rate constant that\nis almost seven times larger than the currently recommended value. In parallel,\nelectronic structure calculations were performed to provide insight into the\nreactive process. While earlier theoretical work at a lower level predicted the\npresence of a barrier for the N(2D) + C2H4 reaction, the present calculations\ndemonstrate that two of the five doublet potential energy surfaces correlating\nwith reagents are likely to be attractive, presenting no barriers for the\nperpendicular approach of the N atom to the carbon double bond of ethene. The\nmeasured rate constants and new product channels taken from recent dynamical\ninvestigations of this process are included in a 1D coupled ion-neutral model\nof Titans atmosphere. These simulations indicate that the modeled abundances of\nnumerous nitrogen bearing compounds are noticeably affected by these changes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 10 Nov 2020 09:18:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-09"}
