In this paper,\nleveraging the sparsity nature of point cloud, we propose a multiscale\nend-to-end learning framework which hierarchically reconstructs the 3D Point\nCloud Geometry (PCG) via progressive re-sampling. The framework is developed on\ntop of a sparse convolution based autoencoder for point cloud compression and\nreconstruction. For the input PCG which has only the binary occupancy\nattribute, our framework translates it to a downscaled point cloud at the\nbottleneck layer which possesses both geometry and associated feature\nattributes. Then, the geometric occupancy is losslessly compressed using an\noctree codec and the feature attributes are lossy compressed using a learned\nprobabilistic context model.Compared to state-of-the-art Video-based Point\nCloud Compression (V-PCC) and Geometry-based PCC (G-PCC) schemes standardized\nby the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG), our method achieves more than 40%\nand 70% BD-Rate (Bjontegaard Delta Rate) reduction, respectively.

Change and transmit (CAT) is an efficient approach to collect these\nreadings, where the readings are not transmitted when there is no enough change\nin consumption. However, this approach causes a privacy problem that is by\nanalyzing the transmission pattern of an SM, sensitive information on the house\ndwellers can be inferred. For instance, since the transmission pattern is\ndistinguishable when dwellers are on travel, attackers may analyze the pattern\nto launch a presence-privacy attack (PPA) to infer whether the dwellers are\nabsent from home. In this paper, we propose a scheme, called \"STDL\", for\nefficient collection of power consumption readings in AMI networks while\npreserving the consumers' privacy by sending spoofing transmissions (redundant\nreal readings) using a deep-learning approach. We first use a clustering\ntechnique and real power consumption readings to create a dataset for\ntransmission patterns using the CAT approach. Then, we train an attacker model\nusing deep-learning, and our evaluations indicate that the success rate of the\nattacker is about 91%.

Single Event Upsets (SEUs) in the SRAM-based Xilinx\nKintex Ultrascale FPGAs used in the ITS readout represent a real concern. To\nclear SEUs affecting the Kintex configuration memory, a secondary Flash-based\nMicrosemi ProASIC3E (PA3) FPGA is used. This device configures and continuously\nscrubs the Xilinx FPGA while data-taking is ongoing, which avoids accumulation\nof SEUs. The communication path to the RUs is via the radiation hard Gigabit\nTransceiver (GBT) system on 100 m long optical links. The PA3 is reachable via\nthe GBT Slow Control Adapter (GBT-SCA) ASIC using a dedicated JTAG bus driving\nchannel. During the course of Run 3, it is foreseeable that the FPGA design of\nthe PA3 will require upgrades to correct possible issues and add new\nfunctionality. It is therefore mandatory that the PA3 itself can be configured\nremotely, for which a dedicated software tool is needed. This paper presents\nthe design and implementation of the distributed tools to re-configure remotely\nthe PA3 FPGAs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Nov 2020 17:30:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-10"}

Hence there is potential\nfor models providing mid-term forecasts of the epidemic trajectory using such\ninformation. The effectiveness of lockdown interventions can also be assessed\nby modelling later epidemic stages, possibly using a multiphase epidemic model.\nCommonly applied methods to analyze epidemic trajectories include\nphenomenological growth models (e.g. the Richards), and variants of the\nsusceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) compartment model. Here we focus on a\npractical forecasting approach, applied to interim UK COVID data, using a\nbivariate Reynolds model (cases and deaths).

Fit to mid-epidemic data\nshows better fit to training data and better cross validation performance for a\nPoisson-logStudent model. Estimation of longer term epidemic data after\nlockdown relaxation, characterised by protracted slow downturn and then upturn\nin cases, casts doubt on effective containment. Many applications of\nphenomenological models have been to complete epidemics. However, evaluation of\nsuch models based simply on their fit to observed data may give only a partial\npicture, and cross-validation against actual trends is also useful.

For these users the\ndirected networks of streets and roads do not limit their movements, but their\nmovements may have other limitations, including lower speed of movement, and\nbeing more dependent on weather and the pavement surface conditions. This paper\nproposes and implements a novel path finding algorithm for open areas, i.e.\nareas with no network of pathways such as grasslands and parks where the\nconventional graph-based algorithms fail to calculate a practically traversable\npath. The new method provides multimodality, a higher level of performance,\nefficiency, and user satisfaction in comparison with currently available\nsolutions. The proposed algorithm creates a new graph in the open area, which\ncan consider the obstacles and barriers and calculate the path based on the\nfactors that are important for wheelchair users. Factors, including slope,\nwidth, and surface condition of the routes, are recognised by mining the actual\ntrajectories of wheelchairs users using trajectory mining and machine learning\ntechniques. Unlike raster-based techniques, a graph-based open area path\nfinding algorithm allows the routing to be fully compatible with current\ntransportation routing services, and enables a full multimodal routing service.\nThe implementations and tests show at least a 76.4% similarity between the\nproposed algorithm outputs and actual wheelchair users trajectories.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Nov 2020 21:20:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-10"}

Our framework comprises two components: (1) we\npresent a multi-modal keypoint detector: an autoencoder architecture trained by\nfusing proprioception and vision to predict visual key points on an object; (2)\nwe show how we can use our learned keypoint detector to learn an extension of\nthe kinematic chain by regressing virtual joints from the predicted visual\nkeypoints. Our evaluation shows that our approach learns to consistently\npredict visual keypoints on objects in the manipulator's hand, and thus can\neasily facilitate learning an extended kinematic chain to include the object\ngrasped in various configurations, from a few seconds of visual data. Finally\nwe show that this extended kinematic chain lends itself for object manipulation\ntasks such as placing a grasped object and present experiments in simulation\nand on hardware.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Nov 2020 01:04:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 25 Jun 2021 16:52:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-28"}

To handle this, the problem is divided into two main parts: 1) the\ndisturbance phase: how to morph the formation optimally to avoid the obstacle\nin the least possible time in the situation at hand, and 2) the convergence\nphase: how to optimally resume the intended formation shape once the threat of\npotential collision has been eliminated. For the first problem, we develop a\nmethodology which tests different formation morphing combinations and finds the\noptimal one, by utilizing trajectory, velocity, and coordinate information, to\nbypass the obstacle. For the second problem, we utilize a thin-plate splines\n(TPS) inspired temperature function minimization method to bring the agents\nback from the distorted formation into the desired formation in an optimal\nmanner, after collision avoidance has been successfully performed.

Computing the Diameter of a graph with\n$m$ edges requires $m^{2-o(1)}$ time under the Strong Exponential Time\nHypothesis (SETH), which can be prohibitive for very large graphs, so efficient\napproximation algorithms for Diameter are desired.\n  There is a folklore algorithm that gives a $2$-approximation for Diameter in\n$\\tilde{O}(m)$ time. Additionally, a line of work concludes with a\n$3/2$-approximation algorithm for Diameter in weighted directed graphs that\nruns in $\\tilde{O}(m^{3/2})$ time. The $3/2$-approximation algorithm is known\nto be tight under SETH: Roditty and Vassilevska W. proved that under SETH any\n$3/2-\\epsilon$ approximation algorithm for Diameter in undirected unweighted\ngraphs requires $m^{2-o(1)}$ time, and then Backurs, Roditty, Segal,\nVassilevska W., and Wein and the follow-up work of Li proved that under SETH\nany $5/3-\\epsilon$ approximation algorithm for Diameter in undirected\nunweighted graphs requires $m^{3/2-o(1)}$ time.\n  Whether or not the folklore 2-approximation algorithm is tight, however, is\nunknown, and has been explicitly posed as an open problem in numerous papers.\nTowards this question, Bonnet recently proved that under SETH, any\n$7/4-\\epsilon$ approximation requires $m^{4/3-o(1)}$, only for directed\nweighted graphs.\n  We completely resolve this question for directed graphs by proving that the\nfolklore 2-approximation algorithm is conditionally optimal.

Several recent experiments revealed a phenomenon of spatial beam\ncleaning of an optical field that propagates through a graded-index multimode\noptical fiber (MMF). Our aim in this article is to provide physical insight\ninto the mechanism underlying optical beam self-cleaning through the analysis\nof wave condensation in the presence of structural disorder inherent to MMFs.\nWe consider experiments of beam cleaning where long pulses are injected in the\nand populate many modes of a 10-20 m MMF, for which the dominant contribution\nof disorder originates from polarization random fluctuations (weak disorder).\nOn the basis of the wave turbulence theory, we derive nonequilibrium kinetic\nequations describing the random waves in a regime where disorder dominates\nnonlinear effects. The theory reveals that the presence of a conservative weak\ndisorder introduces an effective dissipation in the system, which is shown to\ninhibit wave condensation in the usual continuous wave turbulence approach. On\nthe other hand, the experiments of beam cleaning are described by a discrete\nwave turbulence approach, where the effective dissipation induced by disorder\nmodifies the regularization of wave resonances, which leads to an acceleration\nof condensation that can explain the effect of beam self-cleaning. The\nsimulations are in quantitative agreement with the theory. The analysis also\nreveals that the effect of beam cleaning is characterized by a repolarization\nas a natural consequence of the condensation process.

However, there are three main difficulties in incorporating the gaze\ndata in an attention mechanism of deep neural networks: 1) the gaze fixation\npoints are likely to have measurement errors due to blinking and rapid eye\nmovements; 2) it is unclear when and how much the gaze data is correlated with\nvisual attention; and 3) gaze data is not always available in many real-world\nsituations. In this work, we introduce an effective probabilistic approach to\nintegrate human gaze into spatiotemporal attention for egocentric activity\nrecognition. Specifically, we represent the locations of gaze fixation points\nas structured discrete latent variables to model their uncertainties. In\naddition, we model the distribution of gaze fixations using a variational\nmethod. The gaze distribution is learned during the training process so that\nthe ground-truth annotations of gaze locations are no longer needed in testing\nsituations since they are predicted from the learned gaze distribution. The\npredicted gaze locations are used to provide informative attentional cues to\nimprove the recognition performance. Our method outperforms all the previous\nstate-of-the-art approaches on EGTEA, which is a large-scale dataset for\negocentric activity recognition provided with gaze measurements. We also\nperform an ablation study and qualitative analysis to demonstrate that our\nattention mechanism is effective.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Nov 2020 08:02:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-10"}

We implement it mainly by modifying the amplitude\nspectrum predictor (ASP) in the original HiNet vocoder. This modified denoising\nand dereverberation ASP (DNR-ASP) can predict clean log amplitude spectra (LAS)\nfrom input degraded acoustic features. To achieve this, the DNR-ASP first\npredicts the noisy and reverberant LAS, noise LAS related to the noise\ninformation, and room impulse response related to the reverberation information\nthen performs initial denoising and dereverberation. The initial processed LAS\nare then enhanced by another neural network as the final clean LAS.

It has been recently used as a pre-processing\nstep for new model order reduction methods, so it is important to keep the\nnumber of new variables small. Several algorithms have been designed to search\nfor a quadratization with the new variables being monomials in the original\nvariables. To understand the limitations and potential ways of improving such\nalgorithms, we study the following question: can quadratizations with not\nnecessarily monomial new variables produce a model of substantially smaller\ndimension than quadratization with only monomial new variables?\n  To do this, we restrict our attention to scalar polynomial ODEs. Our first\nresult is that a scalar polynomial ODE\n$\\dot{x}=p(x)=a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\\ldots + a_0$ with $n\\geqslant 5$ and\n$a_n\\neq0$ can be quadratized using exactly one new variable if and only if\n$p(x-\\frac{a_{n-1}}{n\\cdot a_n})=a_nx^n+ax^2+bx$ for some $a, b \\in\n\\mathbb{C}$. In fact, the new variable can be taken\n$z:=(x-\\frac{a_{n-1}}{n\\cdot a_n})^{n-1}$. Our second result is that two\nnon-monomial new variables are enough to quadratize all degree $6$ scalar\npolynomial ODEs.

We\nstudy the performance of recurrent models on Dyck-n languages, a particularly\nimportant and well-studied class of CFLs. We find that while recurrent models\ngeneralize nearly perfectly if the lengths of the training and test strings are\nfrom the same range, they perform poorly if the test strings are longer. At the\nsame time, we observe that recurrent models are expressive enough to recognize\nDyck words of arbitrary lengths in finite precision if their depths are\nbounded. Hence, we evaluate our models on samples generated from Dyck languages\nwith bounded depth and find that they are indeed able to generalize to much\nhigher lengths. Since natural language datasets have nested dependencies of\nbounded depth, this may help explain why they perform well in modeling\nhierarchical dependencies in natural language data despite prior works\nindicating poor generalization performance on Dyck languages.

Despite the\nrecent progress and success of Gaussian processes (GPs) based on spectral\nmixture kernels, long-term forecasting remains a challenging problem for these\nkernels because they decay exponentially at large horizons. This is mainly due\nto their use of a mixture of Gaussians to model spectral densities.\nCharacteristics of the signal important for long-term forecasting can be\nunravelled by investigating the distribution of the Fourier coefficients of\n(the training part of) the signal, which is non-smooth, heavy-tailed, sparse,\nand skewed. The heavy tail and skewness characteristics of such distributions\nin the spectral domain allow to capture long-range covariance of the signal in\nthe time domain. Motivated by these observations, we propose to model spectral\ndensities using a skewed Laplace spectral mixture (SLSM) due to the skewness of\nits peaks, sparsity, non-smoothness, and heavy tail characteristics. By\napplying the inverse Fourier Transform to this spectral density we obtain a new\nGP kernel for long-term forecasting. In addition, we adapt the lottery ticket\nmethod, originally developed to prune weights of a neural network, to GPs in\norder to automatically select the number of kernel components. Results of\nextensive experiments, including a multivariate time series, show the\nbeneficial effect of the proposed SLSM kernel for long-term extrapolation and\nrobustness to the choice of the number of mixture components.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Nov 2020 13:03:59 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 10 Aug 2021 03:24:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sat, 2 Oct 2021 04:33:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-05"}

Here we theoretically explore a\npreviously unexplored parameter region in an all-transmon system to address\nthis issue. We show that an feasible parameter region, where the ZZ interaction\nis heavily suppressed while leaving XY interaction with an adequate strength to\nimplement two-qubit gates, can be found for all-transmon systems. Thus,\ntwo-qubit gates, such as cross-resonance gate or iSWAP gate, can be realized\nwithout the detrimental effect from static ZZ interaction. To illustrate this,\nwe demonstrate that an iSWAP gate with fast gate speed and dramatically lower\nconditional phase error can be achieved.

We focus on studying\nthe 250 mu-m Herschel map of the Musca filament and make use of MHD\nsimulations. We find a clear signature of a multiplicative cascade in Musca\nwith an inertial range from 0.05 to 0.65 pc. We show that the proposed\nmicrocanonical approach provides singularity spectra which are truly scale\ninvariant as required to validate any method to analyze multifractality. The\nobtained, for the first time precise enough, singularity spectrum of Musca is\nclearly not as symmetric as usually observed in log-normal behavior. We claim\nthat the ISM towards Musca features more a log-Poisson shape of its singularity\nspectrum. Since log-Poisson behavior is claimed to exist when dissipation is\nstronger for rare events in turbulent flows in contrast to more homogeneous (in\nvolume and time) dissipation events, we suggest that this deviation from\nlog-normality could trace enhanced dissipation in rare events at small scales,\nwhich may explain or is at least consistent with the dominant filamentary\nstructure in Musca. Moreover we find that sub-regions in Musca tends to show\ndifferent multifractal properties. It strongly suggests that different types of\ndynamics exist inside the Musca cloud.

But energy is still a\nbottleneck for many electric long endurance applications. While solar power\ntechnology and battery technology have improved a lot, in rougher conditions\nthey still respectively lack the power or total amount of energy required for\nmany real-world situations. In this paper, we introduce the NederDrone, a\nhybrid lift, hybrid energy hydrogen-powered UAV which can perform vertical\ntake-off and landings using 12 propellers while flying efficiently in forward\nflight thanks to its fixed wings. The energy is supplied from a mix of\nhydrogen-driven fuel-cells to store large amounts of energy and battery power\nfor high power situations. The hydrogen is stored in a pressurized cylinder\naround which the UAV is optimized.

The rough idea\nis simple: use Bluetooth or other data-exchange technologies to record contacts\nbetween users, enable users to report positive diagnoses, and alert users who\nhave been exposed to sick users. Of course, there are many privacy concerns\nassociated with this idea. Much of the work in this area has been concerned\nwith designing mechanisms for tracing contacts and alerting users that do not\nleak additional information about users beyond the existence of exposure\nevents. However, although designing practical protocols is of crucial\nimportance, it is essential to realize that notifying users about exposure\nevents may itself leak confidential information (e.g. that a particular contact\nhas been diagnosed). Luckily, while digital contact tracing is a relatively new\ntask, the generic problem of privacy and data disclosure has been studied for\ndecades. Indeed, the framework of differential privacy further permits provable\nquery privacy by adding random noise. In this article, we translate two results\nfrom statistical privacy and social recommendation algorithms to exposure\nnotification. We thus prove some naive bounds on the degree to which accuracy\nmust be sacrificed if exposure notification frameworks are to be made more\nprivate through the injection of noise.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Nov 2020 15:00:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-10"}

Our results are relevant to\nall the practical situations in which coordination of the networked systems\ninto diverse groups may be desirable, such as for teams of robots, unmanned\nautonomous vehicles, power grids and central pattern generators.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Nov 2020 08:27:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-24"}

We are witnessing a helpless situation due to\nCOVID-19 as no vaccine or drug is effective against the disease. In the present\nstudy, we have tested the applicability of some combination drugs against\nCOVID-19. We have tried to understand the mechanism of action of some\nrepurposed drugs: Favipiravir (F), Hydroxychloroquine (H) and Oseltamivir (O).\nThe ADME analysis have suggested strong inhibitory possibility of F, H, O\ncombination towards receptor protein of $3CL^{pro}$ of SARS-CoV-2 virus. The\nstrong binding affinity, number of hydrogen bond interaction between inhibitor,\nreceptor and lower inhibition constant computed from molecular docking\nvalidated the better complexation possibility of F+H+O: $3CL^{pro}$\ncombination. Various thermodynamical output from Molecular dynamics (MD)\nsimulations like potential energy ($E_g$), temperature (T), density, pressure,\nSASA energy, interaction energies, Gibbs free energy ($\\Delta G_{bind}$) etc.,\nalso favored the complexation between F+H+O and CoV-2 protease. Our In-Silico\nresults have recommended the strong candidature of combination drugs\nFavipiravir, Hydroxychloroquine and Oseltamivir as a potential lead inhibitor\nfor targeting SARS-CoV-2 infections.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Nov 2020 08:11:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-02"}

We first show in theory that\napplying supervised learning to detect user preferences may end up with\ninconsistent results in the absence of exposure information. The counterfactual\npropensity-weighting approach from causal inference can account for the\nexposure mechanism; nevertheless, the partial-observation nature of the\nfeedback data can cause identifiability issues. We propose a principled\nsolution by introducing a minimax empirical risk formulation. We show that the\nrelaxation of the dual problem can be converted to an adversarial game between\ntwo recommendation models, where the opponent of the candidate model\ncharacterizes the underlying exposure mechanism. We provide learning bounds and\nconduct extensive simulation studies to illustrate and justify the proposed\napproach over a broad range of recommendation settings, which shed insights on\nthe various benefits of the proposed approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 8 Nov 2020 00:40:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-07"}
