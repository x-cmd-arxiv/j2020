In this work, we propose an approach\nfor detecting facial masks in videos using deep learning. The proposed\nframework capitalizes on the MTCNN face detection model to identify the faces\nand their corresponding facial landmarks present in the video frame. These\nfacial images and cues are then processed by a neoteric classifier that\nutilises the MobileNetV2 architecture as an object detector for identifying\nmasked regions.

In contrast, previously proposed asynchronous algorithms have not\nbeen proven to achieve such accelerated rate. While CACDM is based on discrete\nupdates, the proof of its convergence crucially depends on a continuous time\nanalysis. 2) We introduce a new communication scheme based on Loss-Networks,\nthat is programmable in a fully asynchronous and decentralized way, unlike the\nPoisson model of asynchronous operation that does not capture essential aspects\nof asynchrony such as non-instantaneous communications and computations.

Transition metal dichalcogenides are excellent candidates for\nthe EI realization because of reduced Coulomb screening, and indeed a\nstructural phase transition was observed in few-layer systems.

Here we\ncharacterize the presence of diffuse radio emission in known galaxy clusters in\nthe HETDEX Spring Field, covering 424 deg$^2$. For this, we developed a method\nto extract individual targets from LOFAR observations processed with the LoTSS\nDDF-pipeline.

Several methods have\nbeen proposed to compress the size of the networks without reducing network\nperformance. Network pruning can reduce redundant and unnecessary parameters\nfrom a network. Knowledge distillation can transfer the knowledge of deeper and\nwider networks to smaller networks. The performance of the smaller network\nobtained by these methods is bounded by the predefined network. Neural\narchitecture search has been proposed, which can search automatically the\narchitecture of the networks to break the structure limitation. Also, there is\na dynamic configuration method to train networks incrementally as sub-networks.\nIn this paper, we present a novel incremental training algorithm for deep\nneural networks called planting. Our planting can search the optimal network\narchitecture with smaller number of parameters for improving the network\nperformance by augmenting channels incrementally to layers of the initial\nnetworks while keeping the earlier trained parameters fixed. Also, we propose\nusing the knowledge distillation method for training the channels planted. By\ntransferring the knowledge of deeper and wider networks, we can grow the\nnetworks effectively and efficiently. We evaluate the effectiveness of the\nproposed method on different datasets such as CIFAR-10/100 and STL-10.

Three different\nmethods for estimating (effective) IFRs are presented: (a) population-averaged\nIFRs based on the assumption that the infection risk is independent of age and\ntime, (b) effective IFRs based on the assumption that the age distribution of\nconfirmed cases approximately reflects the age distribution of infected\nindividuals, and (c) effective IFRs accounting for age- and time-dependent dark\nfigures of infections.

We find that the shape of the mode\nline profiles in intensity is largely dependent on how the oscillation-induced\nvariations of the radiative flux are treated, and that modelling it\nrealistically is crucial to understanding asymmetry reversal. Perturbing a\nsolar-calibrated grey atmosphere model, and adopting the quasi-adiabatic\nframework as a first step, we reproduce the asymmetries observed in the solar\nintensity spectrum for low-frequency modes. We conclude that, unlike previously\nthought, it is not necessary to invoke an additional mechanism (e.g.\nnon-adiabatic effects, coherent non-resonant background signal) to explain\nasymmetry reversal. This additional mechanism is necessary, however, to explain\nasymmetry reversal for higher-order modes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Nov 2020 17:41:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-04"}

The localization of these events in low-latency uses\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) time-series from matched-filtered searches which\nidentify candidate events. Here we report on an improvement to the GstLAL-based\ninspiral pipeline, the low-latency pipeline that identified GW170817 and\nGW190425, which automates the use of SNRs from all detectors in the network in\nrapid localization of GW events. This improvement was incorporated into the\ndetection pipeline prior to the recent third observing run of the Advanced LIGO\nand Advanced Virgo detector network. Previously for this pipeline, manual\nintervention was required to use SNRs from all detectors if a candidate GW\nevent was below an SNR threshold for any detector in the network. The use of\nSNRs from subthreshold events can meaningfully decrease the area of the 90%\nconfidence region estimated by rapid localization. To demonstrate this, we\npresent a study of the simulated detections of $\\mathcal{O}(2\\times10^4)$\nbinary neutron stars using a network mirroring the second observational run of\nthe Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors.

More recently it has been found that critical\ntemperatures can be enhanced by application of uniaxial strain, up to a\ncritical strain, after which it falls off. In this work, we take an\n`instability' approach and seek for divergences in susceptibilities. This\nprovides an unbiased way to distinguish tendencies to competing ground states.\nWe show that in the unstrained compound the singlet and triplet instabilities\nof the normal Fermi liquid phase are closely spaced.

We analyze the population of faint AGN (L_x (2-10 keV) < 10^42\nerg/s) in the Illustris, TNG100, EAGLE, and SIMBA cosmological simulations, and\nfind that the properties of their host galaxies vary from one simulation to\nanother. In Illustris and EAGLE, faint AGN are powered by low-mass BHs located\nin low-mass star-forming galaxies. In TNG100 and SIMBA, they are mostly\nassociated with more massive BHs in quenched massive galaxies. We model the\nX-ray binary populations (XRB) of the simulated galaxies, and find that AGN\noften dominate the galaxy AGN+XRB hard X-ray luminosity at z>2, while XRBs\ndominate in some simulations at z<2. Whether the AGN or XRB emission dominates\nin star-forming and quenched galaxies depends on the simulations. These\ndifferences in simulations can be used to discriminate between galaxy formation\nmodels with future high-resolution X-ray observations. We compare the\nluminosity of simulated faint AGN host galaxies to observations of stacked\ngalaxies from Chandra. Our comparison indicates that the simulations\npost-processed with our X-ray modeling tend to overestimate the AGN+XRB X-ray\nluminosity; luminosity that can be strongly affected by AGN obscuration. Some\nsimulations reveal clear AGN trends as a function of stellar mass (e.g., galaxy\nluminosity drop in massive galaxies), which are not apparent in the\nobservations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Nov 2020 19:00:22 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 20 Nov 2021 11:55:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-23"}

This work aims at developing an automated and general\napproach to measure stellar inclinations, that can be applied to any solar-type\npulsator for which oscillation modes are identified, and at validating it using\nred giant branch stars observed by Kepler. We use the mean height-to-background\nratio of dipole mixed modes with different azimuthal orders to measure stellar\ninclinations.

When taking uncertainties into account, the\nreconstructed distribution of inclinations actually follows the expected\nisotropic distribution of the rotational axis. This work highlights the biases\nthat affect inclination measurements and provides the way to infer their\nunderlying statistical distribution. When the star is seen either pole-on or\nequator-on, measurements are challenging and result in a biased distribution.\nCorrecting biases that appear at the low- and high inclination regimes allows\nus to recover the underlying inclination distribution.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Nov 2020 19:00:31 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 20 Nov 2020 18:12:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-27"}

A major goal of this literature has been to compare different\nalgorithms, such as gradient descent (GD) or stochastic gradient descent (SGD),\nby analyzing their rates of convergence to $\\epsilon$-approximate solutions.\nFor example, the oracle complexity of GD is $O(n\\log(\\epsilon^{-1}))$, where\n$n$ is the number of training samples. When $n$ is large, this can be expensive\nin practice, and SGD is preferred due to its oracle complexity of\n$O(\\epsilon^{-1})$. Such standard analyses only utilize the smoothness of the\nloss function in the parameter being optimized. In contrast, we demonstrate\nthat when the loss function is smooth in the data, we can learn the oracle at\nevery iteration and beat the oracle complexities of both GD and SGD in\nimportant regimes. Specifically, at every iteration, our proposed algorithm\nperforms local polynomial regression to learn the gradient of the loss\nfunction, and then estimates the true gradient of the ERM objective function.\nWe establish that the oracle complexity of our algorithm scales like\n$\\tilde{O}((p \\epsilon^{-1})^{d/(2\\eta)})$ (neglecting sub-dominant factors),\nwhere $d$ and $p$ are the data and parameter space dimensions, respectively,\nand the gradient of the loss function belongs to a $\\eta$-H\\\"{o}lder class with\nrespect to the data. Our proof extends the analysis of local polynomial\nregression in non-parametric statistics to provide interpolation guarantees in\nmultivariate settings, and also exploits tools from the inexact GD literature.\nUnlike GD and SGD, the complexity of our method depends on $d$ and $p$.\nHowever, when $d$ is small and the loss function exhibits modest smoothness in\nthe data, our algorithm beats GD and SGD in oracle complexity for a very broad\nrange of $p$ and $\\epsilon$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Nov 2020 20:10:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-06"}

Like\nother Mott insulating iridates, the Ir$^{4+}$ ion in pyrochlore iridates\ndevelops an effective ${J=1/2}$ moment from the on-site spin-orbit coupling. We\nconsider the generic symmetry-allowed exchange between these local moments on a\npyrochlore lattice and obtain the mean-field phase diagram. Assuming the\nsuperexchange is mediated by direct and/or indirect electron hopping via\nintermediate oxygens, we derive the exchange interactions in the strong\ncoupling regime from the Hubbard model. This exchange has a degenerate\nclassical ground state manifold and quantum fluctuation selects a non-coplanar\nground state, known as quantum order by disorder. Extending to the intermediate\ncoupling regime, the same non-coplanar order is selected from the degenerate\nmanifold by the kinetic energy, which is dubbed \"electron quasi-itinerancy\".

To date, all experimental and theoretical studies of\nsuper- and subradiance in these systems involved the classical correlations\nbetween the emitters.

Owing to\ntheir limited resolution, classical discrete shape representations using point\nclouds, voxels and meshes produce low quality results when used in these\napplications. Several implicit 3D shape representation approaches using deep\nneural networks have been proposed leading to significant improvements in both\nquality of representations as well as the impact on downstream applications.\nHowever, these methods can only be used to represent topologically closed\nshapes which greatly limits the class of shapes that they can represent. As a\nconsequence, they also often require clean, watertight meshes for training. In\nthis work, we propose DUDE - a Deep Unsigned Distance Embedding method which\nalleviates both of these shortcomings. DUDE is a disentangled shape\nrepresentation that utilizes an unsigned distance field (uDF) to represent\nproximity to a surface, and a normal vector field (nVF) to represent surface\norientation. We show that a combination of these two (uDF+nVF) can be used to\nlearn high fidelity representations for arbitrary open/closed shapes. As\nopposed to prior work such as DeepSDF, our shape representations can be\ndirectly learnt from noisy triangle soups, and do not need watertight meshes.\nAdditionally, we propose novel algorithms for extracting and rendering\niso-surfaces from the learnt representations. We validate DUDE on benchmark 3D\ndatasets and demonstrate that it produces significant improvements over the\nstate of the art.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Nov 2020 22:49:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 14 Dec 2020 03:40:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-15"}

This body of literature suggests an interesting\nperspective on theoretical models of opinion formation by interacting parties\nin a network: in addition to considering interventions that directly modify\npeople's intrinsic opinions, it is also natural to consider interventions that\nmodify people's susceptibility to persuasion. In this work, motivated by this\nfact we propose a new framework for social influence. Specifically, we adopt a\npopular model for social opinion dynamics, where each agent has some fixed\ninnate opinion, and a resistance that measures the importance it places on its\ninnate opinion; agents influence one another's opinions through an iterative\nprocess. Under non-trivial conditions, this iterative process converges to some\nequilibrium opinion vector. For the unbudgeted variant of the problem, the goal\nis to select the resistance of each agent (from some given range) such that the\nsum of the equilibrium opinions is minimized. We prove that the objective\nfunction is in general non-convex. Hence, formulating the problem as a convex\nprogram as in an early version of this work (Abebe et al., KDD'18) might have\npotential correctness issues. We instead analyze the structure of the objective\nfunction, and show that any local optimum is also a global optimum, which is\nsomehow surprising as the objective function might not be convex. Furthermore,\nwe combine the iterative process and the local search paradigm to design very\nefficient algorithms that can solve the unbudgeted variant of the problem\noptimally on large-scale graphs containing millions of nodes.

G1547 does not have any detectable CGM absorption down to stringent\nlimits, covering HI (EW$_r$<0.02A, log(N(HI)/cm$^{-2}$)<12.6) and a range of\nlow and high ionisation absorption lines (OI, CII, NII, SiII, CIII, NIII,\nSiIII, CIV, SiIV, NV and OVI). This system is rare, given the covering fraction\nof $1.00_{-0.04}^{+0.00}$ for sub-L* galaxies within 50-100 kpc of quasar\nsightlines. G1547 has a low SFR (1.1 M$_{\\odot}$yr$^{-1}$), SSFR\n($1.5\\times10^{-10}$yr$^{-1}$) and $\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR}$ (0.06\nM$_{\\odot}$yr$^{-1}$kpc$^{-2}$) and does not exhibit AGN or star-formation\ndriven outflows.

Recent study reveals that knowledge can be transferred from one source\ndomain to another unknown target domain, called Universal Domain Adaptation\n(UDA). However, in the real-world application, there are often more than one\nsource domain to be exploited for domain adaptation. In this paper, we formally\npropose a more general domain adaptation setting, universal multi-source domain\nadaptation (UMDA), where the label sets of multiple source domains can be\ndifferent and the label set of target domain is completely unknown. The main\nchallenges in UMDA are to identify the common label set between each source\ndomain and target domain, and to keep the model scalable as the number of\nsource domains increases. To address these challenges, we propose a universal\nmulti-source adaptation network (UMAN) to solve the domain adaptation problem\nwithout increasing the complexity of the model in various UMDA settings. In\nUMAN, we estimate the reliability of each known class in the common label set\nvia the prediction margin, which helps adversarial training to better align the\ndistributions of multiple source domains and target domain in the common label\nset. Moreover, the theoretical guarantee for UMAN is also provided.

In this work, we approach this problem from a multi-modal learning\nperspective, where we use not only the merchant time series data but also the\ninformation of merchant-merchant relationship (i.e., affinity) to verify the\nself-reported business type (i.e., merchant category) of a given merchant.\nSpecifically, we design two individual encoders, where one is responsible for\nencoding temporal information and the other is responsible for affinity\ninformation, and a mechanism to fuse the outputs of the two encoders to\naccomplish the identification task. Our experiments on real-world credit card\ntransaction data between 71,668 merchants and 433,772,755 customers have\ndemonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Nov 2020 01:21:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-22"}

However, these\nencryption algorithms cannot meet the needs of customers who need part of the\ninformation but not the full information in the video. In many cases, such as\nprofessional paid videos or video meetings, users would like to observe some\nvisible information in the encrypted video of the original video to satisfy\ntheir requirements in daily life. Aiming at this demand, this paper proposes a\nmulti-level encryption scheme that is composed of lightweight encryption,\nmedium encryption and heavyweight encryption, where each encryption level can\nobtain a different amount of visual information. It is found that both\nencrypting the luma intraprediction model (IPM) and scrambling the syntax\nelement of the DCT coefficient sign can achieve the performance of a distorted\nvideo in which there is still residual visual information, while encrypting\nboth of them can implement the intensity of encryption and one cannot gain any\nvisual information. The experimental results meet our expectations\nappropriately, indicating that there is a different amount of visual\ninformation in each encryption level. Meanwhile, users can flexibly choose the\nencryption level according to their various requirements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Nov 2020 02:20:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-06"}

Supervised attribute editing requires\nannotated training data which is difficult to obtain and limits the editable\nattributes to those with labels. Therefore, unsupervised attribute editing in\nan disentangled latent space is key to performing neat and versatile semantic\nface editing. In this paper, we present a new technique termed\nStructure-Texture Independent Architecture with Weight Decomposition and\nOrthogonal Regularization (STIA-WO) to disentangle the latent space for\nunsupervised semantic face editing. By applying STIA-WO to GAN, we have\ndeveloped a StyleGAN termed STGAN-WO which performs weight decomposition\nthrough utilizing the style vector to construct a fully controllable weight\nmatrix to regulate image synthesis, and employs orthogonal regularization to\nensure each entry of the style vector only controls one independent feature\nmatrix. To further disentangle the facial attributes, STGAN-WO introduces a\nstructure-texture independent architecture which utilizes two independently and\nidentically distributed (i.i.d.) latent vectors to control the synthesis of the\ntexture and structure components in a disentangled way. Unsupervised semantic\nediting is achieved by moving the latent code in the coarse layers along its\northogonal directions to change texture related attributes or changing the\nlatent code in the fine layers to manipulate structure related ones. We present\nexperimental results which show that our new STGAN-WO can achieve better\nattribute editing than state of the art methods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Nov 2020 03:29:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 19 Jul 2021 01:21:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-20"}

For this, most\nexisting approaches learn embeddings of text and network structure by enforcing\nembeddings of connected nodes to be similar. Then for achieving a modality\nfusion they use the similarities between text embedding of a node with the\nstructure embedding of its connected node and vice versa. This implies that\nthese approaches require edge information for learning embeddings and they\ncannot learn embeddings of unseen nodes. In this paper we propose an approach\nthat achieves both modality fusion and the capability to learn embeddings of\nunseen nodes. The main feature of our model is that it uses an adversarial\nmechanism between text embedding based discriminator, and structure embedding\nbased generator to learn efficient representations. Then for learning\nembeddings of unseen nodes, we use the supervision provided by the text\nembedding based discriminator.

Through various\nexperiments, we confirmed that consistency-based regularization from analytical\nlearning theory could affect the generalization capability of the classifier in\ncombination with the existing uncertainty measurement method.

However, due to the\nlack of Deepfakes datasets with large variance in appearance, which can be\nhardly produced by recent identity swapping methods, the detection algorithm\nmay fail in this situation. In this work, we provide a new identity swapping\nalgorithm with large differences in appearance for face forgery detection. The\nappearance gaps mainly arise from the large discrepancies in illuminations and\nskin colors that widely exist in real-world scenarios. However, due to the\ndifficulties of modeling the complex appearance mapping, it is challenging to\ntransfer fine-grained appearances adaptively while preserving identity traits.\nThis paper formulates appearance mapping as an optimal transport problem and\nproposes an Appearance Optimal Transport model (AOT) to formulate it in both\nlatent and pixel space. Specifically, a relighting generator is designed to\nsimulate the optimal transport plan. It is solved via minimizing the\nWasserstein distance of the learned features in the latent space, enabling\nbetter performance and less computation than conventional optimization. To\nfurther refine the solution of the optimal transport plan, we develop a\nsegmentation game to minimize the Wasserstein distance in the pixel space. A\ndiscriminator is introduced to distinguish the fake parts from a mix of real\nand fake image patches. Extensive experiments reveal that the superiority of\nour method when compared with state-of-the-art methods and the ability of our\ngenerated data to improve the performance of face forgery detection.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Nov 2020 06:17:04 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-06"}

Thanks to the high operational flexibility, unmanned aerial\nvehicle (UAV) could fly close to users to enhance signal strength while\nmaintaining a satisfactory geometry, making it a potential solution to the\nabove challenges. In this article, we propose a UAV-assisted anti-jamming\npositioning system, in which multiple UAVs first utilize\ntime-difference-of-arrival (TDoA) measurements from ground reference stations\nand double-response two-way ranging (DR-TWR) measurements from UAV-to-UAV links\nto perform self-localization as well as clock synchronization, and then act as\nanchor nodes to provide TDoA positioning service for ground users in the\npresence of jamming. To evaluate the feasibility and performance of the\nproposed system, we first derive the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) of UAV\nself-localization. Then, the impacts of UAV position uncertainty and\nsynchronization errors caused by jamming on positioning service are modeled,\nand the theoretical root-mean-square error (RMSE) of user position estimate is\nfurther derived. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed system is a\npromising alternative to existing positioning systems when their services are\ndisrupted by jamming. The most notable advantage of the proposed system is that\nit is fully compatible with existing user equipment (UE) and positioning\nmethods.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Nov 2020 09:52:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-06"}

We measure the monopole oscillation frequency as a function of the\nLHY interaction strength as proposed recently by J{\\o}rgensen et al. [Phys.\nRev.

One of the fundamental tasks\nof circuit switches is to compute a sparse collection of switching\nconfigurations to support a traffic demand matrix. Such a problem has been\naddressed in the literature with variations of the approach proposed by\nBirkhoff in 1946 to decompose a doubly stochastic matrix exactly. However, the\nexisting methods are heuristic and do not have theoretical guarantees on how\nwell a collection of switching configurations (i.e., permutations) can\napproximate a traffic matrix (i.e., a scaled doubly stochastic matrix).\n  In this paper, we revisit Birkhoff's approach and make three contributions.\nFirst, we establish the first theoretical bound on the sparsity of Birkhoff's\nalgorithm (i.e., the number of switching configurations necessary to\napproximate a traffic matrix). In particular, we show that by using a subset of\nthe admissible permutation matrices, Birkhoff's algorithm obtains an\n$\\epsilon$-approximate decomposition with at most $O( \\log(1 / \\epsilon))$\npermutations. Second, we propose a new algorithm, Birkhoff+, which combines the\nwealth of Frank-Wolfe with Birkhoff's approach to obtain sparse decompositions\nin a fast manner. And third, we evaluate the performance of the proposed\nalgorithm numerically and study how this affects the performance of a circuit\nswitch.

In this paper, we propose a novel and robust unsupervised video\nanomaly detection method by frame prediction with proper design which is more\nin line with the characteristics of surveillance videos. The proposed method is\nequipped with a multi-path ConvGRU-based frame prediction network that can\nbetter handle semantically informative objects and areas of different scales\nand capture spatial-temporal dependencies in normal videos. A noise tolerance\nloss is introduced during training to mitigate the interference caused by\nbackground noise. Extensive experiments have been conducted on the CUHK Avenue,\nShanghaiTech Campus, and UCSD Pedestrian datasets, and the results show that\nour proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches.\nRemarkably, our proposed method obtains the frame-level AUROC score of 88.3% on\nthe CUHK Avenue dataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Nov 2020 11:34:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 27 May 2021 05:53:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-28"}

Two stable AEs are observed to be resonantly excited at\ndistinct low and high frequencies in limiter plasmas. The values of f and n do\nnot vary with PA separation.

The high-f AE is detected throughout the transition\nfrom limiter to X-point configuration, though its damping rate increases; the\nlow-f mode, on the other hand, becomes unidentifiable.

Empirical\nresults on MS COCO and PASCAL VOC have demonstrated that FluffNet obtains\nremarkable efficiency with state-of-the-art accuracy. Additionally, we indicate\nthe great generality of the Fluff block by showing how to embed it to other\nwidely-used detectors as well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Nov 2020 12:16:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-06"}

Recently, a longer-horizon,\nmodel-wide approach has been proposed in the form of process model forecasting,\nwhich predicts the future state of a whole process model through the\nforecasting of all activity-to-activity relations at once using time series\nforecasting.\n  This paper introduces the concept of \\emph{predictive process model\nmonitoring} which sits in the middle of both predictive process monitoring and\nprocess model forecasting. Concretely, by modelling a process model as a set of\nconstraints being present between activities over time, we can capture more\ndetailed information between activities compared to process model forecasting,\nwhile being compatible with typical predictive process monitoring objectives\nwhich are often expressed in the same language as these constraints. To achieve\nthis, Processes-As-Movies (PAM) is introduced, i.e., a novel technique capable\nof jointly mining and predicting declarative process constraints between\nactivities in various windows of a process' execution. PAM predicts what\ndeclarative rules hold for a trace (objective-based), which also supports the\nprediction of all constraints together as a process model (model-based).\nVarious recurrent neural network topologies inspired by video analysis tailored\nto temporal high-dimensional input are used to model the process model\nevolution with windows as time steps, including encoder-decoder long short-term\nmemory networks, and convolutional long short-term memory networks.

Nebular\nphase spectroscopy constrains such metal yields, for example through forbidden\nline emission associated with OI, CaII, FeII, or FeIII. Fluid instabilities\nduring the explosion produce a complex 3D ejecta structure, with considerable\nmacroscopic, but no microscopic, mixing of elements. This structure sets a\nformidable challenge for detailed nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium radiative\ntransfer modeling, which is generally limited to 1D in grid-based codes. Here,\nwe present a novel and simple method that allows for macroscopic mixing without\nany microscopic mixing, thereby capturing the essence of mixing in SN\nexplosions. With this new technique, the macroscopically mixed ejecta is built\nby shuffling in mass space, or equivalently in velocity space, the shells from\nthe unmixed coasting ejecta. The method requires no change to the radiative\ntransfer, but necessitates high spatial resolution to resolve the rapid\nvariation in composition with depth inherent to this shuffled-shell structure.\nWe show results for a few radiative-transfer simulations for a Type II SN\nexplosion from a 15Msun progenitor star. Our simulations capture the strong\nvariations in temperature or ionization between the various shells that are\nrich in H, He, O, or Si. Because of nonlocal energy deposition, gamma rays\npermeate through an extended region of the ejecta, making the details of the\nshell arrangement unimportant. The greater physical consistency of the method\ndelivers spectral properties at nebular times that are more reliable, in\nparticular in terms of individual emission line strengths, which may serve to\nconstrain the SN yields and, for core collapse SNe, the progenitor mass.

Classification depends on the extent to\nwhich a test image \"looks like\" a prototype. However, perceptual similarity for\nhumans can be different from the similarity learned by the classification\nmodel. Hence, only visualising prototypes can be insufficient for a user to\nunderstand what a prototype exactly represents, and why the model considers a\nprototype and an image to be similar. We address this ambiguity and argue that\nprototypes should be explained. We improve interpretability by automatically\nenhancing visual prototypes with textual quantitative information about visual\ncharacteristics deemed important by the classification model. Specifically, our\nmethod clarifies the meaning of a prototype by quantifying the influence of\ncolour hue, shape, texture, contrast and saturation and can generate both\nglobal and local explanations.

Within the Hill sphere, the horseshoe\nstreamlines intercept gas flow in circumplanetary disks. The host stars' tidal\nperturbation induces a barrier across the converging streamlines' interface.\nViscous transfer of angular momentum across this tidal barrier determines the\nrate of mass diffusion from the horseshoe streamlines onto the circumplanetary\ndisks, and eventually the accretion rate onto the protoplanets. We carry out a\nseries of numerical simulations to test the influence of this tidal barrier on\nsuper thermal planets.

We then use the Ginzburg-Landau model to determine the\nground state in the presence of a magnetic field. In this way, we obtain\nsuperconducting phase diagrams for six representative Skyrme models, revealing\nthe microphysical magnetic flux distribution throughout the neutron star core.\nThe phase diagrams are rather complex and the locations of most of the phase\ntransitions can only be determined through numerical calculations. Nonetheless,\nwe find that for all equations of state considered in this work, much of the\nouter core exhibits type-1.5 superconductivity, rather than type-II\nsuperconductivity as is generally assumed. For local magnetic field strengths\n$\\lesssim 10^{14} \\, {\\rm G}$, the magnetic flux is distributed\ninhomogeneously, with bundles of magnetic fluxtubes separated by flux-free\nMeissner regions. We provide an approximate criterion to determine the\ntransition between this type-1.5 phase and the type-I region in the inner core.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Nov 2020 14:47:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 26 Feb 2021 17:09:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-01"}

Given an\noverlap detector and a speaker embedding extractor, our method performs\nspectral clustering of segments informed by the output of the overlap detector.\nThis is achieved by transforming the discrete clustering problem into a convex\noptimization problem which is solved by eigen-decomposition. Thereafter, we\ndiscretize the solution by alternatively using singular value decomposition and\na modified version of non-maximal suppression which is constrained by the\noutput of the overlap detector. Furthermore, we detail an HMM-DNN based overlap\ndetector which performs frame-level classification and enforces duration\nconstraints through HMM state transitions. Our method achieves a test\ndiarization error rate (DER) of 24.0% on the mixed-headset setting of the AMI\nmeeting corpus, which is a relative improvement of 15.2% over a strong\nagglomerative hierarchical clustering baseline, and compares favorably with\nother overlap-aware diarization methods.

The majority of dMRI techniques employ standard single\ndiffusion encoding (SDE) measurements, covering different sequence parameter\nranges depending on the complexity of the method. Although many signal\nrepresentations and biophysical models have been proposed for SDE data, they\nare intrinsically limited by a lack of specificity. Advanced dMRI methods have\nbeen proposed to provide additional microstructural information beyond what can\nbe inferred from SDE. These enhanced contrasts can play important roles in\ncharacterizing biological tissues, for instance upon diseases (e.g.\nneurodegenerative, cancer, stroke), aging, learning, and development.\n  In this review we focus on double diffusion encoding (DDE), which stands out\namong other advanced acquisitions for its versatility, ability to probe more\nspecific diffusion correlations, and feasibility for preclinical and clinical\napplications. Various DDE methodologies have been employed to probe compartment\nsizes (Section 3), decouple the effects of microscopic diffusion anisotropy\nfrom orientation dispersion (Section 4), probe displacement correlations, study\nexchange, or suppress fast diffusing compartments (Section 6). DDE measurements\ncan also be used to improve the robustness of biophysical models (Section 5)\nand study intra-cellular diffusion via magnetic resonance spectroscopy of\nmetabolites (Section 7). This review discusses all these topics as well as\nimportant practical aspects related to the implementation and contrast in\npreclinical and clinical settings (Section 9) and aims to provide the readers a\nguide for deciding on the right DDE acquisition for their specific application.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Nov 2020 15:36:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-06"}

Arabic Droid Kufi was used mostly for styling\npage titles and navigation menus, whilst Tahoma was used for styling\nparagraphs. The font size of the Arabic text ranged from 12 to 16 pixels, which\nmay lead to poor readability. Images were used heavily in the Arabic websites\ncausing prolonged site loading times.

However, such a simple\ntrade-off does not adequately describe deep learning models that simultaneously\nattain low bias and variance in the heavily overparameterized regime. A primary\nobstacle in explaining this behavior is that deep learning algorithms typically\ninvolve multiple sources of randomness whose individual contributions are not\nvisible in the total variance. To enable fine-grained analysis, we describe an\ninterpretable, symmetric decomposition of the variance into terms associated\nwith the randomness from sampling, initialization, and the labels.

However, existing methods usually focus on measuring the matching\ndegree between the dialog context and sticker image, which ignores the user\npreference of using stickers. Hence, in this paper, we propose to recommend an\nappropriate sticker to user based on multi-turn dialog context and sticker\nusing history of user. Two main challenges are confronted in this task. One is\nto model the sticker preference of user based on the previous sticker selection\nhistory. Another challenge is to jointly fuse the user preference and the\nmatching between dialog context and candidate sticker into final prediction\nmaking. To tackle these challenges, we propose a \\emph{Preference Enhanced\nSticker Response Selector} (PESRS) model. Specifically, PESRS first employs a\nconvolutional based sticker image encoder and a self-attention based multi-turn\ndialog encoder to obtain the representation of stickers and utterances. Next,\ndeep interaction network is proposed to conduct deep matching between the\nsticker and each utterance. Then, we model the user preference by using the\nrecently selected stickers as input, and use a key-value memory network to\nstore the preference representation. PESRS then learns the short-term and\nlong-term dependency between all interaction results by a fusion network, and\ndynamically fuse the user preference representation into the final sticker\nselection prediction. Extensive experiments conducted on a large-scale\nreal-world dialog dataset show that our model achieves the state-of-the-art\nperformance for all commonly-used metrics.

We show that outside the shell the WKB approximation is\nvalid for any value of $r$ if $mr_{g} \\gg 1$, where $m$ is the mass of the\nfield, and $r_{g}$ is the Schwarzschild radius. Thus, we use semiclassical\nmodes to calculate the flux in the vicinity of the shell, and at spatial\ninfinity, $r \\rightarrow +\\infty$ at the final stage of the collapse, $t\n\\rightarrow +\\infty$ with the use of the covariant point-splitting\nregularization.

Loss control materials\n(LCM) are often used in the mitigation process. Understanding the fracture\neffective hydraulic properties and fluid leakage behavior is crucial to\nmitigate this problem. Analytical modeling of fluid flow in fractures is a tool\nthat can be quickly deployed to assess lost circulation and perform\ndiagnostics, including leakage rate decline, effective fracture conductivity,\nand selection of the LCM. Such models should be applicable to Newtonian and\nnon-Newtonian yield-stress fluids, where the fluid rheology is a nonlinear\nfunction of fluid flow and shear stress. In this work, a new semi-analytical\nsolution is developed to model the flow of non-Newtonian drilling fluid in a\nfractured medium. The solution model is applicable for various fluid types\nexhibiting yield-power-law (Herschel-Bulkley). We use high-resolution\nfinite-element simulations based on the Cauchy equation to verify our\nsolutions. We also generate type-curves and compare them to others in the\nliterature. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model for two\nfield cases encountering lost circulations. To address the subsurface\nuncertainty, we combine the developed solutions with Monte-Carlo and generate\nprobabilistic predictions. The solution method can estimate the range of\nfracture conductivity, parametrized by the fracture hydraulic aperture, and\ntime-dependent fluid loss rate that can predict the cumulative volume of lost\nfluid. The proposed approach is accurate and efficient enough to support\ndecision-making for real-time drilling operations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 5 Nov 2020 13:20:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-28"}

One of the main challenges is to increase the reliability\nof broadcast transmissions that lack of mechanisms to assure the correct\ndelivery of the messages. To address this issue, one option is the use of\nacknowledgments. However, this option has scalability issues when applied to\nbroadcast transmissions because multiple vehicles can transmit acknowledgments\nsimultaneously. To control scalability while addressing reliability of\nbroadcast messages, this paper proposes and evaluates a context-based broadcast\nacknowledgement mechanism where the transmitting vehicles selectively request\nthe acknowledgment of specific/critical broadcast messages, and performs\nretransmissions if they are not correctly received. In addition, the V2X\napplications/services identify the situations/conditions that trigger the\nexecution of the broadcast acknowledgment mechanism, and the receiver(s) that\nshould acknowledge the broadcast messages. The paper evaluates the performance\nof the context-based broadcast acknowledgment mechanism for a Collective\nPerception Service. The obtained results show the proposed mechanism can\ncontribute to improve the awareness of crossing pedestrians at intersections by\nincreasing the reliability in the exchange of CPM messages between vehicles\napproaching the intersection. This solution is being discussed under IEEE\n802.11bd, and thus can be relevant for the standardization process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 4 Nov 2020 23:09:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-02"}
