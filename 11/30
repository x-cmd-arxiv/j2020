However, there are several\nlimitations of existing studies that limit the wide adaptation of open-source\nprojects in a classroom setting, including (1) the selected project is limited\nto one particular project, (2) most studies only investigated on its effect on\nteaching a specific SE concept, and (3) students may make mistakes in their\ncontribution which leads to poor quality code. Meanwhile, software companies\nhave successfully launched programs like Google Summer of Code (GSoC) and\nFindBugs \"fixit\" to contribute to open-source projects. Inspired by the success\nof these programs, we propose GitHub-OSS Fixit, a course project where students\nare taught to contribute to open-source Java projects by fixing bugs reported\nin GitHub. We described our course outline to teach students SE concepts by\nencouraging the usages of several automated program analysis tools. We also\nincluded the carefully designed instructions that we gave to students for\nparticipating in GitHub-OSS Fixit. As all lectures and labs are conducted\nonline, we think that our course design could help in guiding future online SE\ncourses. Overall, our survey results show that students think that GitHub-OSS\nFixit could help them to improve many skills and apply the knowledge taught in\nclass. In total, 154 students have submitted 214 pull requests to 24 different\nJava projects, in which 59 of them have been merged, and 82 have been closed by\ndevelopers.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Nov 2020 16:00:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 14 Feb 2021 07:34:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-16"}

We illustrate this in an $SU(2) \\times U(1)$ gauge\ntheory with charged triplet complex scalar fields admitting Alice strings and\nmonopoles, by introducing charged doublet scalar fields receiving nontrivial AB\nphases around the Alice string. The Alice string carries a half $U(1)$ magnetic\nflux and $1/4$ $SU(2)$ magnetic flux taking a value in two of the $SU(2)$\ngenerators characterizing the $U(1)$ modulus. This string is not confined in\nthe absence of a doublet VEV in the sense that the $SU(2)$ magnetic flux can be\ndetected at large distance by an AB phase around the string. When the doublet\nfield develops VEVs, there appear two kinds of phases that we call deconfined\nand confined phases. When a single Alice string is present in the deconfined\nphase, the $U(1)$ modulus of the string and the vacuum moduli are locked (the\nbulk-soliton moduli locking). In the confined phase, the Alice string is\ninevitably attached by a domain wall that we call an AB defect and is confined\nwith an anti-Alice string or another Alice string with the same $SU(2)$ flux.\nDepending on the partner, the pair annihilates or forms a stable doubly-wound\nAlice string having an $SU(2)$ magnetic flux inside the core, whose color\ncannot be detected at large distance by AB phases, implying the \"color\"\nconfinement. The theory also admits stable Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen string and\na ${\\mathbb Z}_2$ string in the absence of the doublet VEVs, and each decays\ninto two Alice strings in the presence of the doublet VEVs. A monopole in this\ntheory can be constructed as a closed Alice string with the $U(1)$ modulus\ntwisted once, and we show that with the doublet VEVs, monopoles are also\nconfined to monopole mesons of the monopole charge two.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Nov 2020 16:39:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-01"}

CAVs are expected to significantly improve safety by\neliminating the human factor and ensure transportation efficiency by allowing\nusers to monitor transportation network conditions and make better operating\ndecisions. However, CAVs could alter the users' tendency-to-travel, leading to\na higher traffic demand than expected, thus causing rebound effects (e.g.,\nincreased vehicle-miles-traveled). In this chapter, we focus on tackling social\nfactors that could drive an emerging mobility system to unsustainable\ncongestion levels. We propose a mobility market that models the economic\nin-nature interactions of the travelers in a smart city network with roads and\npublic transit infrastructure. Using techniques from mechanism design, we\nintroduce appropriate monetary incentives (e.g., tolls, fares, fees) and show\nhow a mobility system consisting of selfish travelers that seek to travel\neither with a CAV or use public transit can be socially efficient. Furthermore,\nthe proposed mobility market ensures that travelers always report their true\ntravel preferences and always benefit from participating in the market; lastly,\nwe also show that the market generates enough revenue to potentially cover its\noperating costs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Nov 2020 16:54:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 12 Jul 2021 03:13:25 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 10 Oct 2021 03:02:52 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Tue, 19 Oct 2021 16:27:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-20"}

There\nare two intertwined difficulties in estimating this prevalence based on testing\nresults from a group of subjects. First, the test is prone to measurement error\nwith unknown sensitivity and specificity. Second, the prevalence tends to be\nlow at the initial stage of the pandemic and we may not be able to determine if\na positive test result is a false positive due to the imperfect specificity of\nthe test. The statistical inference based on large sample approximation or\nconventional bootstrap may not be sufficiently reliable and yield confidence\nintervals that do not cover the true prevalence at the nominal level. In this\npaper, we have proposed a set of 95% confidence intervals, whose validity is\nguaranteed and doesn't depend on the sample size in the unweighted setting. For\nthe weighted setting, the proposed inference is equivalent to a class of hybrid\nbootstrap methods, whose performance is also more robust to the sample size\nthan those based on asymptotic approximations. The methods are used to\nreanalyze data from a study investigating the antibody prevalence in Santa\nClara county, California, which was the motivating example of this research, in\naddition to several other seroprevalence studies where authors had tried to\ncorrect their estimates for test performance.

More importantly, this\npaper makes three methodological contributions: 1) presenting a comprehensive\nand novel characterization of crowdshipping system states that encompasses\nspatial-temporal and capacity information of crowdsourcees and requests; 2)\nembedding heuristics that leverage the information offered by the state\nrepresentation and are based on intuitive reasoning to guide specific actions\nto take, to preserve tractability and enhance efficiency of training; and 3)\nintegrating rule-interposing to prevent repeated visiting of the same routes\nand node sequences during routing improvement, thereby further enhancing the\ntraining efficiency by accelerating learning. The effectiveness of the proposed\napproach is demonstrated through extensive numerical analysis. The results show\nthe benefits brought by the heuristics-guided action choice and\nrule-interposing in DRL training, and the superiority of the proposed approach\nover existing heuristics in both solution quality, time, and scalability.\nBesides the potential to improve the efficiency of crowdshipping operation\nplanning, the proposed approach also provides a new avenue and generic\nframework for other problems in the vehicle routing context.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Nov 2020 19:50:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-01"}

These new observations, combined with\npublished VLA and the new LOFAR HBA data, allow us to carry out a detailed,\nhigh spatial resolution spectral analysis of the relic over a broad range of\nfrequencies.

Assuming Diffusive Shock Acceleration, we estimate a dominant Mach\nnumber of $\\sim 3.7$ for the shocks that make up the relic. Comparison with\nrecent numerical simulations suggests that in the case of radio relics, the\nslopes of the integrated radio spectra are determined by the Mach number of the\naccelerating shock, with $\\alpha$ nearly constant, namely between $-1.13$ and\n$-1.17$, for Mach numbers $3.5 - 4.0$.

The proof makes use of an upper semicontinuous\nresolution invariant which prescribes the center in each step of the resolution\nalgorithm. The resolution invariant strictly decreases under each blowup. The\ndefinition of the resolution invariant is inspired by the proofs of resolution\nof singularities in arbitrary dimension over fields of characteristic zero. It\nwas developed in an attempt to generalize these proofs to the setting of\narbitrary characteristic. The usual resolution invariant which is used in\ncharacteristic zero behaves very badly over fields of positive characteristic.\nIt is not upper semicontinuous. Further, the invariant may increase under\nblowup which destroys the induction argument. It is shown how these problems\ncan be overcome in the case of surface singularities which are embedded in a\nthree-dimensional smooth ambient space. Analogous to the proofs of resolution\nof singularities in characteristic zero, coefficient ideals are used to enable\ninduction on the dimension of the ambient space. Since hypersurfaces of maximal\ncontact need not exist over fields of positive characteristic, coefficient\nideals are considered instead with respect to all regular hypersurfaces. The\nassociated invariants are then maximized over all local flags of smooth\nsubspaces. To construct flags which realize this maximum, techniques are\nintroduced to maximize invariants of coefficient ideals over all coordinate\nchanges. These so-called \"cleaning techniques\" form a core part of the proof.\nThey can be seen as a characteristic-free generalization of the Tschirnhausen\ntransformation, a classical technique to construct hypersurfaces of maximal\ncontact.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Nov 2020 21:12:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-01"}

Object detection is already very challenging.\nIt is even harder when the images are blurred, from the camera being in a car\nor a hand-held phone. Most existing efforts either focused on sharp images,\nwith easy to label ground truth, or they have treated motion blur as one of\nmany generic corruptions.\n  Instead, we focus especially on the details of egomotion induced blur. We\nexplore five classes of remedies, where each targets different potential causes\nfor the performance gap between sharp and blurred images. For example, first\ndeblurring an image changes its human interpretability, but at present, only\npartly improves object detection. The other four classes of remedies address\nmulti-scale texture, out-of-distribution testing, label generation, and\nconditioning by blur-type. Surprisingly, we discover that custom label\ngeneration aimed at resolving spatial ambiguity, ahead of all others, markedly\nimproves object detection. Also, in contrast to findings from classification,\nwe see a noteworthy boost by conditioning our model on bespoke categories of\nmotion blur.\n  We validate and cross-breed the different remedies experimentally on blurred\nCOCO images and real-world blur datasets, producing an easy and practical\nfavorite model with superior detection rates.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Nov 2020 21:58:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 30 Mar 2021 14:34:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-31"}

Data augmentations encourage models to learn desired\ninvariances, such as invariance to horizontal flipping or small changes in\ncolor. Recent work has shown that arbitrary style transfer can be used as a\nform of data augmentation to encourage invariance to textures by creating\npainting-like images from photographs. However, a stylized photograph is not\nquite the same as an artist-created painting. Artists depict perceptually\nmeaningful cues in paintings so that humans can recognize salient components in\nscenes, an emphasis which is not enforced in style transfer. Therefore, we\nstudy how style transfer and paintings differ in their impact on model\nrobustness. First, we investigate the role of paintings as style images for\nstylization-based data augmentation. We find that style transfer functions well\neven without paintings as style images. Second, we show that learning from\npaintings as a form of perceptual data augmentation can improve model\nrobustness. Finally, we investigate the invariances learned from stylization\nand from paintings, and show that models learn different invariances from these\ndiffering forms of data.

Existing methods apply different kinds of priors or directly minimize\nthe domain discrepancy to address this problem, which lack flexibility in\nhandling real-world situations. Another research pipeline expresses the\ndomain-specific information as a gradual transferring process, which tends to\nbe suboptimal in accurately removing the domain-specific properties. In this\npaper, we address the modeling of domain-invariant and domain-specific\ninformation from the heuristic search perspective. We identify the\ncharacteristics in the existing representations that lead to larger domain\ndiscrepancy as the heuristic representations. With the guidance of heuristic\nrepresentations, we formulate a principled framework of Heuristic Domain\nAdaptation (HDA) with well-founded theoretical guarantees. To perform HDA, the\ncosine similarity scores and independence measurements between domain-invariant\nand domain-specific representations are cast into the constraints at the\ninitial and final states during the learning procedure. Similar to the final\ncondition of heuristic search, we further derive a constraint enforcing the\nfinal range of heuristic network output to be small. Accordingly, we propose\nHeuristic Domain Adaptation Network (HDAN), which explicitly learns the\ndomain-invariant and domain-specific representations with the above mentioned\nconstraints. Extensive experiments show that HDAN has exceeded state-of-the-art\non unsupervised DA, multi-source DA and semi-supervised DA.

In this paper, a conditional random field (CRF) based\nframework is put forward to tackle the tracklet inactivation issue in online\nMOT problems. A discrete CRF which exploits the intra-frame relationship\nbetween tracking hypotheses is developed to improve the robustness of tracklet\ninactivation.

Our core intuition is that all\nmonitoring tools are geared towards an adversary that interferes with the\nvictim's execution in order to extract the most number of secret bits (e.g.,\nthe entire secret) in one or few runs. They cannot, however, detect an\nadversary that leaks smaller portions of the secret - as small as a single bit\n- at each execution of the victim. In particular, by minimizing the information\nleaked at each run, the impact of any side-channel attack on the application's\nperformance is significantly lowered - ensuring that the detection tool does\nnot detect an attack. By repeating the attack multiple times, each time on a\ndifferent part of the secret, the adversary can recover the whole secret and\nremain undetected. Based on this intuition, we adapt known attacks leveraging\npage-tables and L3 cache to bypass existing detection mechanisms. We show\nexperimentally how an attacker can successfully exfiltrate the secret key used\nin an enclave running various cryptographic routines of libgcrypt. Beyond\ncryptographic libraries, we also show how to compromise the predictions of\nenclaves running decision-tree routines of OpenCV.

In this work, we experimentally,\nnumerically, and analytically explore strongly driven two-mode Josephson\ncircuits in the regime of strong driving and large detuning. Specifically, we\ninvestigate beam-splitter and two-mode squeezing interaction between the two\nmodes induced by driving a two-photon sideband transition.

This is an interesting consequence compared to the carrier transition\ncase, where the breakdown of the RWA results in qualitatively different time\nevolution of the quantum state.

It is common sense that\nwe need at least one or more pattern images for camera calibration. However,\nthe proposed method estimates camera parameters from the horizontal and\nvertical field of view information of the camera without any image acquisition.\nThe proposed method is particularly useful for wide-angle or fisheye cameras\nthat have large image distortion. Image distortion is modeled in the way\nfisheye lenses are designed and estimated based on the square pixel assumption\nof the image sensors. The calibration accuracy of the proposed method is\nevaluated on eight different commercial cameras qualitatively and\nquantitatively, and compared with conventional calibration methods. The\nexperimental results show that the calibration accuracy of the zero-shot method\nis comparable to conventional full calibration results. The method can be used\nas a practical alternative in real applications where individual calibration is\ndifficult or impractical, and in most field applications where calibration\naccuracy is less critical.

To apply model-X knockoffs, one must construct\nsynthetic variables, called knockoffs, which effectively act as controls during\nfeature selection. The gold standard for constructing knockoffs has been to\nminimize the mean absolute correlation (MAC) between features and their\nknockoffs, but, surprisingly, we prove this procedure can be powerless in\nextremely easy settings, including Gaussian linear models with correlated\nexchangeable features. The key problem is that minimizing the MAC creates\nstrong joint dependencies between the features and knockoffs, which allow\nmachine learning algorithms to partially or fully reconstruct the effect of the\nfeatures on the response using the knockoffs. To improve the power of\nknockoffs, we propose generating knockoffs which minimize the\nreconstructability (MRC) of the features, and we demonstrate our proposal for\nGaussian features by showing it is computationally efficient, robust, and\npowerful. We also prove that certain MRC knockoffs minimize a natural\ndefinition of estimation error in Gaussian linear models. Furthermore, in an\nextensive set of simulations, we find many settings with correlated features in\nwhich MRC knockoffs dramatically outperform MAC-minimizing knockoffs and no\nsettings in which MAC-minimizing knockoffs outperform MRC knockoffs by more\nthan a very slight margin. We implement our methods and a host of others from\nthe knockoffs literature in a new open source python package knockpy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2020 08:55:19 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Jun 2021 03:40:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-30"}

The shift, sometimes called collective Lamb\nshift, results from resonant dipole-dipole interaction mediated by real and\nvirtual photon exchange, forming many-body states displaying various super- and\nsubradiant spectral behavior. The scattering spectrum reflects the overall\nradiative behavior from these states. However, it also averages out the\nradiative details associated with a single collective state, causing ambiguity\nin explaining the origin of the spectral shift and raising controversy on its\nscaling property. We employ a Monte-Carlo simulation to study how the\ncollective states are occupied and contribute to emission. We thus distinguish\ntwo kinds of collective shift that follow different scaling laws. One results\nfrom dominant occupation of the near-resonant collective states. This shift is\nusually small and insensitive to the density or the number of participating\natoms. The other comes from large spatial correlation of dipoles, associated\nwith the states of higher degree of emission. This corresponds to larger\ncollective shift that is approximately linearly dependent on the optical depth.\nOur analysis provides not only a novel perspective for the spectral features in\ncollective scattering, but also a possible resolution to the controversy on the\nscaling property that has been reported elsewhere because of different origins.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2020 09:20:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-01"}

We also contribute a new synthetic dataset containing 830\nelaborate textured car models labeled with sparse key points and rendered using\nPhysically Based Rendering (PBRT) system with measured HDRI skymaps to obtain\nhighly realistic images. Experiments demonstrate the superior performance of\nour approach on both testing dataset and in-the-wild images. Furthermore, the\npresented technique enables additional applications such as 3D vehicle texture\ntransfer and material identification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2020 09:27:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 29 Mar 2021 05:32:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-30"}

Such initiatives have been met with skepticism among\nauthors, who raise the concern about a potential bias in reviewers'\nrecommendations induced by this information. In this work, we investigate\nwhether reviewers exhibit a bias caused by the knowledge that the submission\nunder review was previously rejected at a similar venue, focusing on a\npopulation of novice reviewers who constitute a large fraction of the reviewer\npool in leading machine learning and computer science conferences.

We evaluate our attacks using two real datasets, and show\nthat our attacks outperform the state-of-the-art that does not use our transfer\nshadow training technique. We also compare four combinations of the\nlearning-based/entropy-based approach and the fine-tuning/freezing approach,\nall of which employ our transfer shadow training technique. Then we examine the\nperformance of these four approaches based on the distributions of confidence\nvalues, and discuss possible countermeasures against our attacks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2020 10:03:43 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Feb 2021 13:20:40 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 23 Apr 2021 14:50:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-05-02"}

In this study, we characterize the interaction\nbetween the precessing vortex core (PVC), which is the consequence of a global\nhydrodynamic instability, and thermoacoustic instabilities, which are the\nresult of a resonant coupling between combustor acoustics and the unsteady heat\nrelease rate of combustion. This characterization is performed using\nexperimental data obtained from a model gas turbine combustor system employing\ntwo concentric swirling nozzles of air, separated by a ring of fuel injectors,\noperating at 5 bar pressure. The flow split between the two streams is\nsystematically varied to observe the impact of flow structure variation on the\nflow and flame dynamics. High-speed sPIV, OH-PLIF, and acetone PLIF are used to\nobtain information about the velocity fields, flame, and fuel flow behavior,\nrespectively. Spectral POD and spatial frequency analysis are used to identify\nand characterize the dominant oscillation mechanisms driving the system. Three\ndominant modes are seen: two thermoacoustic modes and the precessing vortex\ncore. Our results show that in the cases where the frequency of the PVC\noverlaps with either of the thermoacoustic modes, the thermoacoustic modes are\nsuppressed. A weakly nonlinear asymptotic analysis shows that the suppression\nof the axisymmetric shear layer shedding, and hence thermoacoustic mode, is the\nresult of a nonlinear coupling between the PVC and the axisymmetric mode of the\nswirling jet. Evolution equations for both the symmetric and PVC modes are\nderived to show the controlling parameters that drive this suppression. We\nconclude by discussing ways in which thermoacoustic instability suppression can\nbe achieved through combustor flow field design.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2020 10:06:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-01"}

Specifically, episodes of tasks are\nconstructed with data augmentations from unlabeled base classes during\nmeta-training, and we apply embedding-based classifiers to novel tasks with\nlabeled few-shot examples during meta-test.

A standard\nexplanation of this result is that these filters reflect the structure of the\nimages that they have been exposed to during training: Natural images typically\nare locally composed of oriented contours at various scales and oriented\nbandpass filters are matched to such structure. We offer an alternative\nexplanation based not on the structure of images, but rather on the structure\nof convolutional architectures. In particular, complex exponentials are the\neigenfunctions of convolution. These eigenfunctions are defined globally;\nhowever, convolutional architectures operate locally. To enforce locality, one\ncan apply a windowing function to the eigenfunctions, which leads to oriented\nbandpass filters as the natural operators to be learned with convolutional\narchitectures. From a representational point of view, these filters allow for a\nlocal systematic way to characterize and operate on an image or other signal.\nWe offer empirical support for the hypothesis that convolutional networks learn\nsuch filters at all of their convolutional layers. While previous research has\nshown evidence of filters having oriented bandpass characteristics at early\nlayers, ours appears to be the first study to document the predominance of such\nfilter characteristics at all layers. Previous studies have missed this\nobservation because they have concentrated on the cumulative compositional\neffects of filtering across layers, while we examine the filter characteristics\nthat are present at each layer.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2020 10:10:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-01"}

However, learning the\nabstract parameters is a highly non-linear process and suffers from image-model\nmisalignment, leading to mediocre model performance. In contrast, 3D keypoint\nestimation methods combine deep CNN network with the volumetric representation\nto achieve pixel-level localization accuracy but may predict unrealistic body\nstructure. In this paper, we address the above issues by bridging the gap\nbetween body mesh estimation and 3D keypoint estimation. We propose a novel\nhybrid inverse kinematics solution (HybrIK). HybrIK directly transforms\naccurate 3D joints to relative body-part rotations for 3D body mesh\nreconstruction, via the twist-and-swing decomposition. The swing rotation is\nanalytically solved with 3D joints, and the twist rotation is derived from the\nvisual cues through the neural network.

Here, we propose a novel feature extraction method\ncalled anchored Short Time Fourier Transform (anchored-STFT), which is an\nadvanced version of STFT, as it minimizes the trade-off between temporal and\nspectral resolution presented by STFT. In addition, we propose a novel\naugmentation method, called gradient norm adversarial augmentation (GNAA). GNAA\nis not only an augmentation method but is also used to harness adversarial\ninputs in EEG data, which not only improves the classification accuracy but\nalso enhances the robustness of the classifier. In addition, we also propose a\nnew CNN architecture, namely Skip-Net, for the classification of EEG signals.\nThe proposed pipeline outperforms all state-of-the-art methods and yields an\naverage classification accuracy of 90.7 % and 89.54 % on BCI competition II\ndataset III and BCI competition IV dataset 2b, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2020 11:18:06 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 23 Apr 2021 15:30:24 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 7 Jul 2021 09:57:18 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Mon, 9 Aug 2021 12:20:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-10"}

Given limited sensor\nmeasurements both along and between axial stations, we require a statistically\nprincipled approach to inferring these profiles. In this paper we detail a\nBayesian methodology for interpolating the spatial temperature or pressure\nprofile at axial stations within an aeroengine. The profile at any given axial\nstation is represented as a spatial Gaussian random field on an annulus, with\ncircumferential variations modelled using a Fourier basis and radial variations\nmodelled with a squared exponential kernel. This Gaussian random field is\nextended to ingest data from multiple axial measurement planes, with the aim of\ntransferring information across the planes. To facilitate this type of transfer\nlearning, a novel planar covariance kernel is proposed, with hyperparameters\nthat characterise the correlation between any two measurement planes.

The key to a successful\napproach is to measure length scales that are representative of the energy\ncontained in the solution (energetically relevant) and indicative of the\nestablished force balance (dynamically relevant). In numerical simulations of\nrotating convection and magneto-hydrodynamic dynamos in spherical shells, it\nhas remained difficult to measure length scales that are both energetically and\ndynamically relevant, which has led to conflicting interpretations of the\nunderlying force balance. By analysing an extensive set of magnetic and\nnon-magnetic models, we focus on two length scales that achieve both energetic\nand dynamical relevance. The first one is the peak of the poloidal kinetic\nenergy spectrum, which we successfully compare to crossover points on spectral\nrepresentations of the force balance. In most dynamo models, this result\nconfirms that the dominant length scale of the system is controlled by a\nquasi-geostrophic (QG-) MAC (Magneto-Archimedean-Coriolis) balance. In\nnon-magnetic convection models, the analysis favours a QG-CIA\n(Coriolis-Inertia-Archimedean) balance. In dynamo models, we introduce a second\nenergetically relevant length scale associated with the loss of axial\ninvariance in the flow. We again relate this length scale to a crossover point\nin scale-dependent force balance diagrams, which marks the transition between\nlarge-scale geostrophy (the equilibrium of Coriolis and pressure forces) and\nsmall-scale magnetostrophy, where the Lorentz force overtakes the Coriolis\nforce. Scaling analysis of these two energetically and dynamically relevant\nlength scales suggests that the Earth's dynamo is controlled by a QG-MAC\nbalance at a dominant scale of about 200 km, while magnetostrophic effects are\ndeferred to scales smaller than 50 km.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2020 11:27:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-01"}

Since the 1960s\nresearchers have attempted to solve the inverse swarm problem of obtaining\ncross sections from swarm data; but the solutions are not necessarily unique.\nTo address this issues, we examine the use of deep learning models which are\ntrained using the previous determinations of elastic momentum transfer,\nionization and excitation cross sections for different gases available on the\nLXCat website and their corresponding swarm parameters calculated using the\nBOLSIG+ solver for the numerical solution of the Boltzmann equation for\nelectrons in weakly ionized gases.

However, most existing methods are non-real-time, which may\nfall short in intelligent systems. Although a few real-time text methods are\nproposed, the detection accuracy is far behind non-real-time methods. To\nimprove the detection accuracy and speed simultaneously, we propose a novel\nfast and accurate text detection framework, namely CM-Net, which is constructed\nbased on a new text representation method and a multi-perspective feature (MPF)\nmodule. The former can fit arbitrary-shaped text contours by concentric mask\n(CM) in an efficient and robust way. The latter encourages the network to learn\nmore CM-related discriminative features from multiple perspectives and brings\nno extra computational cost. Benefiting the advantages of CM and MPF, the\nproposed CM-Net only needs to predict one CM of the text instance to rebuild\nthe text contour and achieves the best balance between detection accuracy and\nspeed compared with previous works. Moreover, to ensure that multi-perspective\nfeatures are effectively learned, the multi-factor constraints loss is\nproposed. Extensive experiments demonstrate the proposed CM is efficient and\nrobust to fit arbitrary-shaped text instances, and also validate the\neffectiveness of MPF and constraints loss for discriminative text features\nrecognition. Furthermore, experimental results show that the proposed CM-Net is\nsuperior to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) real-time text detection methods\nin both detection speed and accuracy on MSRA-TD500, CTW1500, Total-Text, and\nICDAR2015 datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2020 11:54:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Dec 2020 09:05:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Sun, 20 Dec 2020 05:56:29 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 18 Mar 2021 00:34:47 GMT"},{"version":"v5","created":"Tue, 11 May 2021 13:29:01 GMT"},{"version":"v6","created":"Fri, 21 May 2021 10:47:02 GMT"},{"version":"v7","created":"Sat, 2 Oct 2021 11:13:41 GMT"},{"version":"v8","created":"Fri, 26 Nov 2021 08:00:56 GMT"},{"version":"v9","created":"Sat, 22 Jan 2022 03:53:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-01-25"}

In particular, the sensitivity of the best optomechanical devices has\nreached the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL), which directly follows from the\nHeisenberg uncertainty relation and corresponds to balancing the measurement\nimprecision and the perturbation of the probe by the quantum back action of the\nmeter. The SQL is not truly fundamental and several methods for its overcoming\nhave been proposed and demonstrated. At the same time, two quantum sensitivity\nconstraints which are more fundamental are known. The first limit arises from\nthe finiteness of the probing strength (in the case of optical interferometers\n- of the circulating optical power) and is known as the Energetic Quantum Limit\nor, in a more general context, as the Quantum Cram\\'{e}r-Rao Bound (QCRB). The\nsecond limit arises from the dissipative dynamics of the probe, which prevents\nfull efficacy of the quantum back action evasion techniques developed for\novercoming the SQL. No particular name has been assigned to this limit; we\npropose the term Dissipative Quantum Limit (DQL) for it. Here we develop a\nunified theory of these two fundamental limits by deriving the general\nsensitivity constraint from which they follow as particular cases. Our analysis\nreveals a phase transition occurring at the boundary between the QCRB-dominated\nand the DQL regimes, manifested by the discontinuous derivatives of the optimal\nspectral densities of the meter field quantum noise. This leads to the\ncounter-intuitive (but favorable) finding that quantum-limited sensitivity can\nbe achieved with certain lossy meter systems. Finally, we show that the DQL\noriginates from the non-autocommutativity of the internal thermal noise of the\nprobe and that it can be overcome in non-stationary measurements.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2020 11:58:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 18 Dec 2020 11:24:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-05"}

It\nfocuses on the Eulerian modeling approach, in which the evolution of the\nparticle size spectrum is carried out using a fixed-bin discretization\nassociated with inherent numerical diffusion. Focus is on the applications of\nMPDATA numerical schemes (variants explored include: infinite-gauge,\nnon-oscillatory, third-order-terms and recursive antidiffusive correction).\nMethodology for handling coordinate transformations associated with both\nparticle size distribution variable choice and numerical grid layout are\nexpounded. Analysis of the performance of the scheme is performed using: (i) an\nanalytically solvable box-model test case, and (ii) the single-column \"KiD\"\ntest case in which the size-spectral advection due to condensation is solved\nsimultaneously with the spatial advection in the vertical physical coordinate,\nand in which the supersaturation evolution is coupled with the droplet growth\nthrough water mass budget. The single-column problem involves numerical\nsolution of a two-dimensional advection problem (spectral and spatial\ndimensions).

The formation\nof low-mass star formation is directly associated with the presence of disks\nand jets. According to this scenario, radio jets are expected to be common in\nhigh-mass star-forming regions. We aim to increase the number of known radio\njets in high-mass star forming regions by searching for radio jet candidates at\nradio continuum wavelengths. We have used the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array\n(VLA) to observe 18 high-mass star-forming regions in the C band (6 cm, ~1.0\narcsec resolution) and K band (1.3 cm, ~0.3 arcsec resolution). We have\nsearched for radio jet candidates by studying the association of radio\ncontinuum sources with shock activity signposts. We have identified 7 as the\nmost probable radio jets. The radio luminosity of the radio jet candidates is\ncorrelated with the bolometric luminosity and the outflow momentum rate. About\n7-36% of the radio jet candidates are associated with non-thermal emission. The\nradio jet candidates associated with 6.7 GHz CH3OH maser emission are\npreferentially thermal winds and jets, while a considerable fraction of radio\njet candidates associated with H2O masers show non-thermal emission, likely due\nto strong shocks. Our sample of 18 regions is divided in 8 less evolved,\ninfrared-dark regions and 10 more evolved, infrared-bright regions. We have\nfound that ~71% of the identified radio jet candidates are located in the more\nevolved regions. Similarly, 25% of the less evolved regions harbor one of the\nmost probable radio jets, while up to 50% of the more evolved regions contain\none of these radio jet candidates. This suggests that the detection of radio\njets in high-mass star forming regions is larger in slightly more evolved\nregions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2020 12:12:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-04"}

The proposed trial design is applicable to any\nset of composite populations, considering normally distributed endpoints and\nrandom baseline covariates. Treatment effects for composite populations are\ntested by combining $p$-values, calculated on the subset levels, using the\ninverse normal combination function to generate test statistics for those\ncomposite populations.

It not only eases the difficulty of\nlearning 2-D manifold surfaces from sparse 3D space, the point clouds in each\nobject proposal convey shape details that support implicit function learning to\nreconstruct any high-resolution surfaces. Our experiments indicate that\ninstance detection and reconstruction present complementary effects, where the\nshape prediction head shows consistent effects on improving object detection\nwith modern 3D proposal network backbones. The qualitative and quantitative\nevaluations further demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms the\nstate-of-the-arts and improves over 11 of mesh IoU in object reconstruction.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2020 12:58:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-01"}

Since LGRBs are produced by only a small fraction of\nmassive stars, it is paramount to have a good understanding of their underlying\nintrinsic population in order to use them as cosmological probes without\nintroducing any unwanted bias. The goal of this work is to constrain and\ncharacterise this intrinsic population. We developed a Monte Carlo model where\neach burst is described by its redshift and its properties at the peak of the\nlightcurve. We derived the best fit parameters by comparing our synthetic\npopulations to carefully selected observational constraints based on the\nCGRO/BATSE, Fermi/GBM and Swift/BAT samples with appropriate flux thresholds.\nWe explored different scenarios in terms of cosmic evolution of the luminosity\nfunction and/or of the redshift distribution as well as including or not the\npresence of intrinsic spectral-energetics (Ep-L) correlations. We find that the\nexistence of an intrinsic Ep-L correlation is preferred but with a shallower\nslope than observed($\\alpha_A \\sim 0.3$) and a larger scatter ($\\sim 0.4$ dex).\nWe find a strong degeneracy between the cosmic evolution of the luminosity and\nof the LGRB rate, and show that a sample both larger and deeper than SHOALS by\na factor of three is needed to lift this degeneracy. The observed We conclude\nthat Ep-L correlation cannot be explained only by selection effects although\nthese do play a role in shaping the observed relation. The degeneracy between\ncosmic evolution of the luminosity function and of the redshift distribution of\nLGRBs should be included in the uncertainties of star formation rate estimates;\nthese amount to a factor of 10 at $z=6$ and up to a factor of 50 at $z=9$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2020 13:00:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-02"}

Reflective optics provide unparalleled spectral\nperformance and can be used to reduce overall volume and weight. So far, most\nreflective designs have focused on two or three reflections, while\nfour-reflection freeform designs can deliver a higher light throughput (faster\nF-number) as well as a larger field-of-view (FOV). However, advanced optical\ndesign strategies for four-reflection freeform systems have been rarely\nreported in literature. This is due to the increased complexity in solution\nspace but also the fact that additional mirrors hinder a cost-effective\nrealization (manufacture, alignment, etc.).\n  Recently, we have proposed a novel design method to directly calculate the\nfreeform surface coefficients while merely knowing the mirror positions and\ntilts. Consequently, this method allows laymen with basic optical design\nknowledge to calculate 'first time right' freeform imaging systems in a matter\nof minutes. This contrasts with most common freeform design processes, which\nrequires considerable experience, intuition or guesswork.

In the\nthree different regimes, significantly different flow organizations are\nidentified: In regime I and regime ${\\rm{II}}_a$, the location of the maximal\nhorizontal velocity is close to the top and bottom walls; However, in regime\n${\\rm{II}}_b$ and regime III, banded zonal flow structures develop and the\nmaximal horizontal velocity now is in the bulk region.\n  The different flow organizations in the three regimes are also reflected in\nthe scaling exponents in the effective power law scalings $Nu\\sim Ra^\\beta$ and\n$Re\\sim Ra^\\gamma$. In regime I, the fitted scaling exponents\n($\\beta\\approx0.26$ and $\\gamma\\approx0.51$) are in excellent agreement with\nthe theoretical predication of $\\beta=1/4$ and $\\gamma=1/2$ for laminar VC\n(Shishkina, {\\it{Phys. Rev. E.}} 2016, 93, 051102). However, in regimes II and\nIII, $\\beta$ increases to a value close to 1/3 and $\\gamma$ decreases to a\nvalue close to 4/9. The stronger $Ra$ dependence of $Nu$ is related to the\nejection of plumes and larger local heat flux at the walls.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2020 14:06:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-05"}

In this work, we consider sectorial\nmatrices, whose numerical ranges do not contain the origin, and adopt the\ncanonical angles of such matrices as their phases. Similarly to the rank of a\nmatrix defined to be the number of its nonzero singular values, we define the\nphase-rank of a sectorial matrix as the number of its nonzero phases. While a\nlow-rank approximation problem is associated with matrix arithmetic means, as a\nnatural parallel we formulate a low phase-rank approximation problem using\nmatrix geometric means to measure the approximation error. A characterization\nof the solutions to the proposed problem is then obtained, when both the\nobjective matrix and the approximant are restricted to be positive-imaginary.\nMoreover, the obtained solution has the same flavor as the Schmidt-Mirsky\ntheorem on low-rank approximation problems.

In stable systems this collective behaviour (i) amplifies\nthe noisy fluctuations in the system's gravitational potential, effectively\n'dressing' the two-body (star-star) encounters, and (ii) allows the system to\nsupport large-scale density waves (a.k.a. normal modes) which decay through\nresonant wave-star interactions. If the relaxation of the system is dominated\nby effect (i) then it is described by the Balescu-Lenard (BL) kinetic theory.\nMeanwhile if (ii) dominates, one must describe relaxation using quasilinear\n(QL) theory, though in the stellar-dynamical context the full set of QL\nequations has never been presented.

Most of the research into these methods\nfocuses on the first step of generating the affinity, which often exploits the\nself-expressive property of linear subspaces, with little consideration\ntypically given to the spectral clustering step that produces the final\nclustering. Moreover, existing methods often obtain the final affinity that is\nused in the spectral clustering step by applying ad-hoc or arbitrarily chosen\npostprocessing steps to the affinity generated by a self-expressive clustering\nformulation, which can have a significant impact on the overall clustering\nperformance. In this work, we unify these two steps by learning both a\nself-expressive representation of the data and an affinity matrix that is\nwell-normalized for spectral clustering. In our proposed models, we constrain\nthe affinity matrix to be doubly stochastic, which results in a principled\nmethod for affinity matrix normalization while also exploiting known benefits\nof doubly stochastic normalization in spectral clustering. We develop a general\nframework and derive two models: one that jointly learns the self-expressive\nrepresentation along with the doubly stochastic affinity, and one that\nsequentially solves for one then the other.

We obtain four regimes corresponding to stable,\npartially stable, unstable and no slurries. No slurry is found when the heat\nflow at the base of the layer exceeds the heat flow at the top, while a\nstably-stratified slurry arises when advection overcomes thermal diffusion ($Pe\n\\gtrsim Le$) that exists over a wide range of parameters relevant to the\nEarth's core.

In RR the tuning\nparameter determining the penalty strength is usually obtained by minimizing\nsome measure of the out-of-sample prediction error or information criterion.\nHowever, in presence of separation tuning these measures can yield an optimized\nvalue of zero (no shrinkage), and hence cannot provide a universal solution. We\nderive a new bootstrap based tuning criterion $B$ that always leads to\nshrinkage. Moreover, we demonstrate how valid inference can be obtained by\ncombining resampled profile penalized likelihood functions. Our approach is\nillustrated in an example from oncology and its performance is compared to FC\nin a simulation study. Our simulations showed that in analyses of small and\nsparse datasets and with many correlated covariates $B$-tuned RR can yield\ncoefficient estimates with MSE smaller than FC and confidence intervals that\napproximately achieve nominal coverage probabilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2020 15:03:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-01"}

The set\nof possible realizations of the uncertain data is described by a so-called\nuncertainty set. In many scenarios, a decision maker may influence the\nuncertainty regime she is facing, for example, by investing in market research,\nor in machines which work with higher precision. Recently, this situation was\naddressed in the literature by introducing decision dependent uncertainty sets\n(endogenous uncertainty), i.e., uncertainty sets whose structure depends on\n(typically discrete) decision variables. In this way, one can model the\ntrade-off between reducing the cost of robustness versus the cost of the\ninvestment necessary for influencing the uncertainty. However, there is another\ntrade-off to be made here. With different uncertainty regimes, not only do the\nworst-case optimal solutions vary, but also other aspects of that solutions\nsuch as max-regret, best-case performance or predictability of the performance.\nA decision maker may still be interested in having a performance guarantee, but\nat the same time be willing to forgo superior worst-case performance if those\nother aspects can be enhanced by switching to a suitable uncertainty regime. We\nintroduce the notion of uncertainty preference in order to capture such\nstances. We present three ways to formalize uncertainty preferences and study\nthe resulting mathematical models. The goal is to have\nreformulations/approximations of these models which can be solved with standard\nmethods. The workhorse is mixed-integer linear and conic optimization.

Chemical\nreactions in the gas phase are one of the possible processes that could modify\nthe $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N ratio. We aim at investigating if and how the passage of\na shock wave in the interstellar medium, can affect the relative fraction of\nnitrogen isotopes. The ideal place for such a study is the L1157 outflow, where\nseveral shocked clumps are present. We present the first measurement of the\n$^{14}$N/$^{15}$N ratio in the two shocked clumps, B1 and B0, of the\nprotostellar outflow L1157, derived from the interferomteric maps of the\nH$^{13}$CN(1-0) and the HC$^{15}$N(1-0) lines. In B1, we find that the\nH$^{13}$CN(1-0) and HC$^{15}$N(1-0) emission traces the front of the clump,\nwith averaged column density of $N$(H$^{13}$CN) $\\sim$ 7$\\times$10$^{12}$\ncm$^{-2}$ and $N$(HC$^{15}$N) $\\sim$ 2$\\times$10$^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$. In this\nregion the ratio H$^{13}$CN(1-0)/HC$^{15}$N(1-0) is quite uniform with an\naverage value of $\\sim$ 5$\\pm$1. The same average value is also measured in the\nsmaller clump B0e. Assuming the standard $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C = 68, we obtain\n$^{14}$N/$^{15}$N = 340$\\pm$70, similar to those usually found in prestellar\ncores and protostars. We analysed the prediction of a chemical shock model for\nseveral shock conditions and we found that the nitrogen and carbon\nfractionations do not vary much for the first period after the shock. The\nobserved H$^{13}$CN/HC$^{15}$N can be reproduced by a non-dissociative, C-type\nshock with parameters in agreement with previous modelling of L1157-B1. Both\nobservations and chemical models indicate that the shock propagation does not\naffect the nitrogen isotopic ratio that remains similar to that measured in\nlower temperature gas in prestellar cores and in protostellar envelopes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2020 15:24:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 7 Dec 2020 12:33:57 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 2 Apr 2021 13:13:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-05"}

In recent years, the single degenerate helium (He) donor\nchannel, where a white dwarf star (WD) accretes He-rich matter from a\nhydrogen-depleted companion, has emerged as a promising candidate progenitor\nscenario for these events. An unresolved question in this scenario is the fate\nof the companion star, which would be evident as a runaway hot subdwarf (He\nsdO/B) in the aftermath of the SN event. Previous studies have shown that the\nkinematic properties of an ejected companion provide an opportunity to closer\nexamination of the properties of an SN progenitor system. However, with the\nnumber of observed objects not matching predictions by theory, the viability of\nthis mechanism is called into question. In this study, we first synthesize a\npopulation of companion stars ejected by the aforementioned mechanism, taking\ninto account predicted ejection velocities, inferred population density in the\nGalactic (Gal.) mass distribution and subsequent kinematics in the Gal.\npotential. We then discuss the astrometric properties of this population. We\npresent $10^{6}$ individual ejection trajectories, numerically computed with a\nnewly developed, lightweight simulation framework. A peak in the density\ndistribution for close objects is expected in the direction of the Gal. center.\nIf the entire considered mass range is realized, the radial velocity\ndistribution should show a peak at 500\\kms. If only close US\\,708 analogues are\nconsidered, there should be a peak at ($\\sim750-850$)\\kms.

In the case of complex\nthree-dimensional geometries, a Monte Carlo-based method that simulates photon\npackages as they move through and interact with their environment is often\nused. Previous studies have shown, in the regime of high optical depths, that\nthe required number of simulated photon packages strongly rises and estimated\nfluxes may be severely underestimated. In this paper we identify two problems\nthat arise for Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations that hinder a proper\ndetermination of flux: first, a mismatch between the probability and weight of\nthe path of a photon package and second, the necessity of simulating a wide\nrange of high scattering orders. Furthermore, we argue that the peel-off method\npartly solves these problems, and we additionally propose an extended peel-off\nmethod. Our proposed method improves several shortcomings of its basic variant\nand relies on the utilization of precalculated sphere spectra. We then combine\nboth peel-off methods with the Split method and the Stretch method and\nnumerically evaluate their capabilities as opposed to the pure\nSplit$\\,\\&\\,$Stretch method in an infinite plane-parallel slab setup. We find\nthat the peel-off method greatly enhances the performance of these simulations;\nin particular, at a transverse optical depth of $\\tau_{\\rm max}=75$ our method\nachieved a significantly lower error than previous methods while simultaneously\nsaving ${>}95\\%$ computation time. Finally, we discuss the inclusion of\npolarization and Mie-scattering in the extended peel-off method, and argue that\nit may be necessary to equip future Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations\nwith additional advanced pathfinding techniques.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2020 15:40:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-27"}

However, the existing work on DL based JSCC usually trains the\ndesigned network to operate under a specific signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)\nregime, without taking into account that the SNR level during the deployment\nstage may differ from that during the training stage. A number of networks are\nrequired to cover the scenario with a broad range of SNRs, which is\ncomputational inefficiency (in the training stage) and requires large storage.\nTo overcome these drawbacks our paper proposes a novel method called Attention\nDL based JSCC (ADJSCC) that can successfully operate with different SNR levels\nduring transmission. This design is inspired by the resource assignment\nstrategy in traditional JSCC, which dynamically adjusts the compression ratio\nin source coding and the channel coding rate according to the channel SNR. This\nis achieved by resorting to attention mechanisms because these are able to\nallocate computing resources to more critical tasks. Instead of applying the\nresource allocation strategy in traditional JSCC, the ADJSCC uses the\nchannel-wise soft attention to scaling features according to SNR conditions. We\ncompare the ADJSCC method with the state-of-the-art DL based JSCC method\nthrough extensive experiments to demonstrate its adaptability, robustness and\nversatility. Compared with the existing methods, the proposed method takes less\nstorage and is more robust in the presence of channel mismatch.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2020 04:28:55 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 3 Jun 2021 02:31:27 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Tue, 12 Apr 2022 00:29:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-13"}

Beside technical improvements of the cost and speed of\nindividual tests, pool testing may be used to improve efficiency and throughput\nof a population test. Dorfman pool testing procedure is one of the best known\nand studied methods of this kind. This procedure is, however, based on\nunrealistic assumptions that the pool test has perfect sensitivity and the only\nobjective is to minimize the number of tests, and is not well adapted to the\ncase of imperfect pool tests. We propose and analyze a simple modification of\nthis procedure in which test of a pool with negative result is independently\nrepeated up to several times. The proposed procedure is evaluated in a\ncomputational study using recent data about dilution effect for SARS-CoV-2 PCR\ntests, showing that the proposed approach significantly reduces the number of\nfalse negatives with a relatively small increase of the number of tests,\nespecially for small prevalence rates. For example, for prevalence rate 0.001\nthe number of tests could be reduced to 22.1% of individual tests, increasing\nthe expected number of false negatives by no more than 1%, and to 16.8% of\nindividual tests increasing the expected number of false negatives by no more\nthan 10%. At the same time, a similar reduction of the expected number of tests\nin the standard Dorfman procedure would yield 675% and 821% increase of the\nexpected number of false negatives, respectively.

The aims of this chapter are twofold. Firstly, it describes the\nprimary building blocks of blockchain technology. Secondly, it illustrates\nvarious use-case scenarios of blockchain technology in the fields of\nAgriculture, Energy Health and others.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 30 Nov 2020 13:19:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-03"}

Epidemiological studies require data that are in alignment with\nthe classifications established for occupations or economic activities. The\nclassifications usually include hundreds of codes and titles. Manual coding of\nraw data may result in misclassification and be time consuming.

Three\ntext classifiers, i.e. Complement Naive Bayes (CNB), Support Vector Machine\n(SVM) and Random Forest Classifier (RFC), were investigated using a k-fold\ncross-validation. 30 000 free-texts with manually assigned classification codes\nof French classification of occupations (PCS) and French classification of\nactivities (NAF) were available. For recoding, Procode integrated a workflow\nthat converts codes of one classification to another according to existing\ncrosswalks.
