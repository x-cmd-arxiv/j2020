Hence,\nalmost all supervised cross-modal hashing methods usually depends on defining a\nsimilarity between datapoints with the label information to guide the hashing\nmodel learning fully or partly. However, the defined similarity between\ndatapoints can only capture the label information of datapoints partially and\nmisses abundant semantic information, then hinders the further improvement of\nretrieval performance. Thus, in this paper, different from previous works, we\npropose a novel cross-modal hashing method without defining the similarity\nbetween datapoints, called Deep Cross-modal Hashing via\n\\textit{Margin-dynamic-softmax Loss} (DCHML). Specifically, DCHML first trains\na proxy hashing network to transform each category information of a dataset\ninto a semantic discriminative hash code, called proxy hash code. Each proxy\nhash code can preserve the semantic information of its corresponding category\nwell. Next, without defining the similarity between datapoints to supervise the\ntraining process of the modality-specific hashing networks , we propose a novel\n\\textit{margin-dynamic-softmax loss} to directly utilize the proxy hashing\ncodes as supervised information. Finally, by minimizing the novel\n\\textit{margin-dynamic-softmax loss}, the modality-specific hashing networks\ncan be trained to generate hash codes which can simultaneously preserve the\ncross-modal similarity and abundant semantic information well.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Nov 2020 16:02:35 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 May 2021 15:02:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-19"}

We study the bias for the\nclimb process depending on the dislocation orientation and the applied stress\nas coming from both the gradient of the chemical potential and the transport\ncoefficients. Both terms are modified by the applied stress and therefore\ncontribute to climb. Surprisingly, even though the vacancy migration barrier\ndistribution is modified by the external stress as obtained by nudged-elastic\nband calculations, the mobilities resulting from a kinetic Monte Carlo model\napplied on the obtained energy landscape are indistinguishable, independently\nof the stress. Moreover, an object kinetic Monte Carlo (OKMC) model including\nthe effect of the dislocation strain field to first order shows indeed a slight\nanisotropic component in the diffusion in more complex dislocation\nconfigurations. However, the OKMC results highlight the fact that the\nthermodynamic component is the dominant driving force.

An\nattempt to address the challenge first requires a comprehensive assessment and\nthen the development of error estimators to highlight regions that require\nrefinement. Following the work of Schranner et al., a novel approach to\nestimate the numerical dissipation of the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE)\nequations is proposed. The presented approach allows the computation of the\nlocal numerical dissipation for arbitrary curvilinear grids through a\npost-processing procedure. This method, as well as empirical and\nkinetic-energy-based approaches, are employed to estimate the inherent\nnumerical TKE. We incorporate the numerical TKE to evaluate an effective eddy\nviscosity, an effective Kolmogorov length scale, and an effective TKE to build\na family of Index Quality (IQ) based error estimators. The proposed IQ based\nestimators are then assessed and utilized to show their effectiveness through\nan application of grid adaptation for the periodic hill test case and\ntransitional flow over the SD 7003 airfoil. Numerical results are validated\nthrough a comparison against reference LES and experimental data. Flow over the\nadapted grids appear better abled to capture pertinent flow features and\nintegrated functions, such as the lift and drag coefficients.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Nov 2020 16:46:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-09"}

Specifically, the\nintegrator is designed for cases when large numbers of test particles (tens or\nhundreds of thousands) need to be followed for long durations (millions of\norbits) to assess the orbital stability of their initially \"close-encounter\nfree\" orbits. The GLISSE (Gpu Long-term Integrator for Solar System Evolution)\ncode implements several optimizations to achieve a roughly factor of 100 speed\nincrease over running the same code on a CPU. We explain how various hardware\nspeed bottlenecks can be avoided by the careful code design, although some of\nthe choices restrict the usage to specific types of application.\n  As a first application, we study the long-term stability of small bodies\ninitially on orbits between Uranus and Neptune. We map out in detail the small\nportion of the phase space in which small bodies can survive for 4.5 billion\nyears of evolution; the ability to integrate large numbers of particles allow\nus to identify for the first time how instability-inducing mean-motion\nresonance overlaps sharply define the stable regions. As a second application,\nwe map the boundaries of 4 Gyr stability or transneptunian objects in the 5:2\nand 3:1 mean-motion resonances, demonstrating that long-term perturbations\nremove the initially stable Neptune-crossing members.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Nov 2020 17:34:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-09"}

The\nadvantage of such descriptions is that they are relatively simple and display\nthe classical behavior for large universes. However, they may smooth out an\nimportant inner structure and to include it a more detailed treatment is\nneeded. The purpose of the present work is to investigate quantum uncertainty\nin the basic background variables and its influence on primordial gravitational\nwaves. To this end we quantize a model of the\nFriedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker universe filled with a linear barotropic\ncosmological fluid and with gravitational waves. We carefully derive the\ndynamical equations for the perturbations in quantum spacetime. The\nquantization yields an equation of motion for the Fourier modes of\ngravitational radiation, which is a quantum extension to the usual parametric\noscillator equation for gravitational waves propagating in an expanding\nuniverse. The two quantum effects from the cosmological background that enter\nthe enhanced equation of motion are (i) a repulsive potential resolving the big\nbang singularity and replacing it with a big bounce and (ii) uncertainties in\nthe numerical values for the background spacetime dynamical variables. First we\nstudy the former effect and its consequences for the primordial amplitude\nspectrum and carefully discuss the relation between the bounce scale and the\nphysical predictions of the model. Next we investigate the latter effect, in\nparticular the extent to which it may affect the primordial amplitude of\ngravitational waves. Making use of the WKB approximation we find an analytical\nformula for the amplitude spectrum as a function of the quantum dispersion of\nthe background spacetime.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Nov 2020 17:38:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 27 Apr 2021 17:46:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-28"}

To access this information, we must track the 3PCF's\ndependence not only on each triangle's shape, but also on its orientation with\nrespect to the line of sight. Consequently, different choices for the line of\nsight will affect the measured 3PCF. Up to now, the line of sight has been\ntaken as the direction to a single triplet member (STM), but which triplet\nmember is used impacts the 3PCF by ~20% of the statistical error for a\nBOSS-like survey. For DESI (2019-24), which is 5X more precise, this would\ntranslate to 100% of the statistical error, increasing the total error bar by\n40%. We here propose a new method that is fully symmetric between the triplet\nmembers, and uses either the average of the three galaxy position vectors\n(which we show points to the triangle centroid), or the average of their unit\n(direction) vectors. Naively, these approaches would seem to require triplet\ncounting, scaling as $N^3$, with $N$ the number of objects in the survey. By\nharnessing the solid harmonic shift theorem, we here show how these methods can\nbe evaluated scaling as $N^2$. We expect that they can be used to make a\nrobust, systematics-free measurement of the anisotropic 3PCF of upcoming\nredshift surveys such as DESI.

The\ncommon practice is to separate the learning of the model from its use, by\nconstructing a model of the environment's dynamics that correctly predicts the\nobserved state transitions. In this paper we argue that the limited\nrepresentational resources of model-based RL agents are better used to build\nmodels that are directly useful for value-based planning. As our main\ncontribution, we introduce the principle of value equivalence: two models are\nvalue equivalent with respect to a set of functions and policies if they yield\nthe same Bellman updates. We propose a formulation of the model learning\nproblem based on the value equivalence principle and analyze how the set of\nfeasible solutions is impacted by the choice of policies and functions.\nSpecifically, we show that, as we augment the set of policies and functions\nconsidered, the class of value equivalent models shrinks, until eventually\ncollapsing to a single point corresponding to a model that perfectly describes\nthe environment. In many problems, directly modelling state-to-state\ntransitions may be both difficult and unnecessary. By leveraging the\nvalue-equivalence principle one may find simpler models without compromising\nperformance, saving computation and memory. We illustrate the benefits of\nvalue-equivalent model learning with experiments comparing it against more\ntraditional counterparts like maximum likelihood estimation. More generally, we\nargue that the principle of value equivalence underlies a number of recent\nempirical successes in RL, such as Value Iteration Networks, the Predictron,\nValue Prediction Networks, TreeQN, and MuZero, and provides a first theoretical\nunderpinning of those results.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Nov 2020 18:25:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-09"}

For these reasons, they are often preferred to inversion\nstrategies even if the latter approaches are generally more accurate in terms\nof proper reconstruction of the depth of the targets and of reliable retrieval\nof true resistivity values of the subsurface. In this research, we discuss a\nnovel approach, based on neural network techniques, capable of retrieving\nresistivity models with a quality comparable with the inversion strategy, but\nin a fraction of the time. We demonstrate the advantages of the proposed novel\napproach on synthetic and field datasets.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Nov 2020 18:53:37 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-09"}

However, creating\nindividual capacity at each facility is not necessarily the optimal approach,\nand redistributing demand and critical resources between facilities can reduce\nthe total required capacity. Data shows that this additional load was unevenly\ndistributed between hospitals during the COVID-19 pandemic, requiring some to\ncreate surge capacity while nearby hospitals had unused capacity. Not only is\nthis inefficient, but it also could lead to a decreased quality of care at\nover-capacity hospitals. In this work, we study the problem of finding optimal\ndemand and resource transfers to minimize the required surge capacity and\nresource shortage during a period of heightened demand. We develop and analyze\na series of linear and mixed-integer programming models that solve variants of\nthe demand and resource redistribution problem. We additionally consider demand\nuncertainty and use robust optimization to ensure solution feasibility. We also\nincorporate a range of operational constraints and costs that decision-makers\nmay need to consider when implementing such a scheme. Our models are validated\nretrospectively using COVID-19 hospitalization data from New Jersey, Texas, and\nMiami, yielding at least an 85% reduction in required surge capacity relative\nto the observed outcome of each case. Results show that such solutions are\noperationally feasible and sufficiently robust against demand uncertainty. In\nsummary, this work provides decision-makers in healthcare systems with a\npractical and flexible tool to reduce the surge capacity necessary to properly\ncare for patients in cases when some facilities are over capacity.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Nov 2020 18:56:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-09"}

It is possible that the\nexistence of new `dark sector' forces, yet undiscovered, are the key to solving\nthis fundamental problem. In this paper, we construct a model in which a dark\nphoton mediates interactions with the SM via kinetic mixing. Unlike traditional\nmodels, in which the dark photon, which couples to a dark charge, $Q_D$, mixes\nwith the hypercharge boson, our model effectively mixes the dark photon\ndirectly with the photon after electroweak symmetry is broken, but remains\nunmixed until the symmetry breaks. The kinetic mixing is generated at one loop\nby fields which satisfy $\\sum Q_D Q_{em} = 0$, a condition which guarantees a\nfinite result at one loop. In the literature, this has been traditionally\nobtained via heavy fermions, which may lie out of the reach of current\naccelerators. In this model, by contrast, this process is mediated by scalar\n`portal matter' fields, which are charged under the $SU(2)_L \\times U(1)_Y$ of\nthe standard model as well as the dark gauge group $U(1)_D$ and acquire\nGeV-scale vevs which give mass to the dark Higgs and dark photon. The\nadditional scalar fields are relatively light, at or below the weak scale, yet\nmay remain undetected by current experiments since their couplings to SM\nfermions come only through percent level mixing with the SM Higgs. At\ncolliders, these models are typified by relatively low MET due the BSM states\ndecaying into MET and SM bosons, with MET which is balanced by the decay of the\nassociated production object. Nevertheless, the higher statistics of HL-LHC may\nbe able to probe the entirety of the model space.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Nov 2020 18:57:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Nov 2020 19:23:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-20"}

With total masses in the range $1-2\n{\\rm M_\\odot}$, these remnants may either leave behind a single massive WD or\nundergo a merger-induced collapse to a neutron star (NS). On the way to their\nfinal fate, these objects generally experience a $\\sim 10$ kyr luminous giant\nphase, which may be extended if sufficient helium remains to set up a stable\nshell-burning configuration. The uncertain, but likely significant, mass loss\nrate during this phase influences the final remnant mass and fate (WD or NS).\nWe find that the initial CO core composition of the WD is converted to\noxygen-neon (ONe) in remnants with final masses $\\gtrsim 1.05 {\\rm M_\\odot}$.\nThis implies that the CO core / ONe core transition in single WDs formed via\nmergers occurs at a similar mass as in WDs descended from single stars, and\nthus that WD-WD mergers do not naturally provide a route to producing\nultra-massive CO-core WDs. As the remnant contracts towards a compact\nconfiguration, it experiences a \"bottleneck\" that sets the characteristic total\nangular momentum that can be retained. This limit predicts single WDs formed\nfrom WD-WD mergers have rotational periods of $\\approx 10-20$ min on the WD\ncooling track. Similarly, it predicts remnants that collapse can form NSs with\nrotational periods $\\sim 10$ ms.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Nov 2020 19:00:00 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-13"}

One pressing\nquestion is to understand the fraction of binaries originating from different\nformation channels, such as isolated field formation versus dynamical formation\nin dense stellar clusters. In this paper, we combine the $\\texttt{COSMIC}$\nbinary population synthesis suite and the $\\texttt{CMC}$ code for globular\ncluster evolution to create a mixture model for black hole binary formation\nunder both formation scenarios. For the first time, these code bodies are\ncombined self-consistently, with $\\texttt{CMC}$ itself employing\n$\\texttt{COSMIC}$ to track stellar evolution. We then use a deep-learning\nenhanced hierarchical Bayesian analysis to constrain the mixture fraction $f$\nbetween formation models, while simultaneously constraining the common envelope\nefficiency $\\alpha$ assumed in $\\texttt{COSMIC}$ and the initial cluster virial\nradius $r_v$ assumed in $\\texttt{CMC}$.

Errors in physical\nchannels typically arrive in clumps, but most decoders are designed assuming\nthat channels are memoryless. As a result, communication networks rely on\ninterleaving over tens of thousands of bits so that channel conditions match\ndecoder assumptions. Even for short high rate codes, awaiting sufficient data\nto interleave at the sender and de-interleave at the receiver is a significant\nsource of unwanted latency. Using existing decoders with non-interleaved\nchannels causes a degradation in block error rate performance owing to mismatch\nbetween the decoder's channel model and true channel behaviour.\n  Through further development of the recently proposed Guessing Random Additive\nNoise Decoding (GRAND) algorithm, which we call GRAND-MO for GRAND Markov\nOrder, here we establish that by abandoning interleaving and embracing bursty\nnoise, low-latency, short-code, high-rate communication is possible with block\nerror rates that outperform their interleaved counterparts by a substantial\nmargin. Moreover, while most decoders are twinned to a specific code-book\nstructure, GRAND-MO can decode any code. Using this property, we establish that\ncertain well-known structured codes are ill-suited for use in bursty channels,\nbut Random Linear Codes (RLCs) are robust to correlated noise. This work\nsuggests that the use of RLCs with GRAND-MO is a good candidate for\napplications requiring high throughput with low latency.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Nov 2020 19:08:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2023-04-18"}

We find that the galaxies powering\noutflows do not possess significantly different global gas fractions or\nstar-formation efficiencies when compared with a control sample. However, the\nALMA maps reveal that the molecular gas in the outflow-type galaxies is\ndistributed more centrally than in the control galaxies. For our outflow-type\nobjects, molecular gas and star-formation is largely confined within their\ninner effective radius ($\\rm r_{eff}$), whereas in the control sample the\ndistribution is more diffuse, extending far beyond $\\rm r_{eff}$. We infer that\noutflows in normal star-forming galaxies may be caused by dynamical mechanisms\nthat drive molecular gas into their central regions, which can result in\nlocally-enhanced gas surface density and star-formation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Nov 2020 19:09:32 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sat, 14 Nov 2020 15:24:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 10 Dec 2020 17:42:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-11"}

However, most of these approaches require a combination of\nchanged and unchanged image pairs for training. Thus, these methods can not\ndirectly be used for datasets where only changed image pairs are available. We\npresent W-CDNet, a novel weakly supervised change detection network that can be\ntrained with image-level semantic labels. Additionally, W-CDNet can be trained\nwith two different types of datasets, either containing changed image pairs\nonly or a mixture of changed and unchanged image pairs. Since we use\nimage-level semantic labels for training, we simultaneously create a change\nmask and label the changed object for single-label images. W-CDNet employs a\nW-shaped siamese U-net to extract feature maps from an image pair which then\nget compared in order to create a raw change mask. The core part of our model,\nthe Change Segmentation and Classification (CSC) module, learns an accurate\nchange mask at a hidden layer by using a custom Remapping Block and then\nsegmenting the current input image with the change mask. The segmented image is\nused to predict the image-level semantic label. The correct label can only be\npredicted if the change mask actually marks relevant change. This forces the\nmodel to learn an accurate change mask.

We provide quantitative evaluation\non two datasets and qualitative results for visual inspection. Quantitative\nevaluation is performed on data consisting of 8,851 normal (healthy), 6,045\npneumonia, and 3,323 Covid-19 CXR scans. In Dataset-1, our model achieves\n95.57\\% average accuracy for a three classes classification, 99\\% precision,\nrecall, and F1-scores for COVID-19 cases. For Dataset-2, we have obtained\n94.44\\% average accuracy, and 95\\% precision, recall, and F1-scores for\ndetection of COVID-19. Our proposed multi-feature guided CNN achieves improved\nresults compared to single-feature CNN proving the importance of the local\nphase-based CXR image enhancement\n(https://github.com/endiqq/Fus-CNNs_COVID-19).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Nov 2020 20:26:26 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 14 Apr 2021 16:08:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-07"}

Typically, an ELC maneuver is triggered by emergency cues from\nthe front or the end of convoy as a response to either avoiding an obstacle or\nmaking way for other vehicles to pass. From a safety viewpoint, connectivity of\nACVs is essential as it entails obtaining or exchanging information about other\nACVs in the convoy. This paper assumes that ACVs have reliable connectivity and\nthat every following ACV has the information about GPS position traces of the\nlead and immediately preceding vehicles in the convoy. This information\nprovides a \"discretized\" preview of the trajectory to be tracked. Based on the\navailable information, this article focuses on two schemes for synthesizing\nlateral control of ACVs based on(a) a single composite ELC trajectory that\nfuses lead and preceding vehicle's GPS traces and (b) separate ELC trajectories\nbased on preview data of preceding and lead vehicles. The former case entails\nthe construction of a single composite ELC trajectory, determine the\ncross-track error, heading and yaw rate errors with respect to this trajectory\nand synthesize a lateral control action. The latter case entails the\nconstruction of two separate trajectories corresponding to the lead vehicle's\nand preceding vehicle's data separately and the subsequent computation of two\nsets of associated errors and lateral control actions and combining them to\nprovide a steering command. Numerical and experimental results corroborate the\neffectiveness of these two schemes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Nov 2020 20:32:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-10"}

This spectral inversion problem, however, is ambiguous since\nSPOD relies on spectral estimation. We demonstrate SPOD-based flow field\nreconstruction using direct inversion of the SPOD algorithm (frequency-domain\napproach) and propose an alternative approach based on projection of the time\nseries data onto the modes (time-domain approach). While the SPOD optimally\nrepresents the flow in a statistical sense, the time-domain approach seeks an\noptimal reconstruction of each instantaneous flow field. We further propose a\nSPOD-based denoising strategy that is based on hard-thresholding of the SPOD\neigenvalues. The proposed strategy achieves significant noise reduction while\nfacilitating drastic data compression. In contrast to standard methods of\nfrequency-time analysis such as wavelet transform, a proposed SPOD-based\napproach yields a spectrogram that characterizes the temporal evolution of\nspatially coherent flow structures. In the frequency-domain, time-varying\nexpansion coefficients can be obtained by basing the SPOD on a sliding window.\nThis approach, however, is computationally intractable, and an alternative\nstrategy based on convolution in the time-domain is presented. When applied to\nthe turbulent jet data, SPOD-based frequency-time analysis reveals that the\nintermittent occurrence of large-scale coherent structures is directly\nassociated with high-energy events.

Realistically, we might expect only a\nsubset of them to adopt any non-compulsory fairness-conscious policy, a\nsituation that political philosophers call partial compliance. This possibility\nraises important questions: how does the strategic behavior of decision\nsubjects in partial compliance settings affect the allocation outcomes?

In this\npaper, a new RIS-aided edge caching system is proposed, where a network cost\nminimization problem is formulated to optimize content placement at cache\nunits, active beamforming at base station and passive phase shifting at RIS.\nAfter decoupling the content placement subproblem with hybrid beamforming\ndesign, we propose an alternating optimization algorithm to tackle the active\nbeamforming and passive phase shifting.

Outliers are typically\nthe result of incorrect data association or feature matching, and it is common\nto have problems where more than 90% of the measurements used for estimation\nare outliers. While current approaches for robust estimation are able to deal\nwith moderate amounts of outliers, they fail to produce accurate estimates in\nthe presence of many outliers. This paper develops an approach to prune\noutliers. First, we develop a theory of invariance that allows us to quickly\ncheck if a subset of measurements are mutually compatible without explicitly\nsolving the estimation problem. Second, we develop a graph-theoretic framework,\nwhere measurements are modeled as vertices and mutual compatibility is captured\nby edges. We generalize existing results showing that the inliers form a clique\nin this graph and typically belong to the maximum clique. We also show that in\npractice the maximum k-core of the compatibility graph provides an\napproximation of the maximum clique, while being faster to compute in large\nproblems. These two contributions leads to ROBIN, our approach to Reject\nOutliers Based on INvariants, which allows us to quickly prune outliers in\ngeneric estimation problems.

By randomly remapping the data blocks and accessing redundant\nblocks, ORAM prevents access pattern leakage through obfuscation.

Next, we\ndiscuss some of the challenges in the design of a persistent ORAM system and\npropose some solutions to those challenges.

Changes in particulate\nmatter density often lead to degradation in visibility. Therefore, several\napproaches utilize multi-spectral data as auxiliary information for haze\nremoval.

The proposed H2H module reconstructs several visual bands\nfrom RGB images in an unsupervised manner, which overcomes the lack of hazy\nhyperspectral aerial image datasets. The module utilizes task supervision and\ndomain adaptation in order to create a \"hyperspectral catalyst\" for image\ndehazing.

In order to overcome\nthe computational difficulties of the full complex models, on one hand, and the\nlimitations of surrogate models, on the other, this work proposes a new\naccelerated time-stepping strategy that combines information from both. This\napproach is based on the multirate infinitesimal general-structure additive\nRunge-Kutta (MRI-GARK) framework. The inexpensive surrogate model is integrated\nwith a small timestep to guide the solution trajectory, and the full model is\ntreated with a large timestep to occasionally correct for the surrogate model\nerror and ensure convergence.

It\nprovides an acceptable ranging accuracy in favorable environments when a\nline-of-sight (LOS) path exists. Otherwise, a signal is detoured along with\nnon-LOS paths, making the resultant ranging results different from the\nground-truth, called an RTT bias, which is the main reason for poor positioning\nperformance. To address it, we aim at leveraging the user mobility trajectory\ndetected by a smartphone's inertial measurement units, called pedestrian dead\nreckoning (PDR). Specifically, PDR provides the geographic relation among\nadjacent locations, guiding the resultant positioning estimates' sequence not\nto deviate from the user trajectory. To this end, we describe their relations\nas multiple geometric equations, enabling us to render a novel positioning\nalgorithm with acceptable accuracy. Depending on the mobility pattern being\nlinear or arbitrary, we develop different algorithms divided into two phases.\nFirst, we can jointly estimate an RTT bias of each AP and the user's step\nlength by leveraging the geometric relation mentioned above. It enables us to\nconstruct a user's relative trajectory defined on the concerned AP's local\ncoordinate system. Second, we align every AP's relative trajectory into a\nsingle one, called trajectory alignment, equivalent to transformation to the\nglobal coordinate system. As a result, we can estimate the sequence of the\nuser's absolute locations from the aligned trajectory.

To address this challenge, we propose\na method to incorporate considerations of coil complexity in the optimization\nof the plasma boundary.

Going beyond individual games, we explore the tractability of\nquantum combinatorial games as whole, and address fundamental questions\nincluding:\n  Quantum Leap in Complexity: Are there polynomial-time solvable games whose\nquantum extensions are intractable?\n  Quantum Collapses in Complexity: Are there PSPACE-complete games whose\nquantum extensions fall to the lower levels of the polynomial-time hierarchy?\n  Quantumness Matters: How do outcome classes and strategies change under\nquantum moves? Under what conditions doesn't quantumness matter?\n  PSPACE Barrier for Quantum Leap: Can quantum moves launch PSPACE games into\nouter polynomial space\n  We show that quantum moves not only enrich the game structure, but also\nimpact their computational complexity. In settling some of these basic\nquestions, we characterize both the powers and limitations of quantum moves as\nwell as the superposition of game configurations that they create. Our\nconstructive proofs-both on the leap of complexity in concrete Quantum Nim and\nQuantum Undirected Geography and on the continuous collapses, in the quantum\nsetting, of complexity in abstract PSPACE-complete games to each level of the\npolynomial-time hierarchy-illustrate the striking computational landscape over\nquantum games and highlight surprising turns with unexpected quantum impact.\nOur studies also enable us to identify several elegant open questions\nfundamental to quantum combinatorial game theory (QCGT).\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Nov 2020 06:09:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-10"}

Recently, there are various image feature learning\nmethods developed which relieve us of the need for training data and perform\nimage restoration and image synthesis, e.g., DIP, InGAN, and SinGAN. SinGAN is\na generative model that is unconditional and could be learned from a single\nnatural image. This model primarily captures the internal distribution of the\npatches which are present in the image and is capable of generating samples of\nvaried diversity while preserving the visual content of the image.

The data are generated\nfrom a reference direct numerical simulation (DNS) which is sub-sampled at\ndifferent spatiotemporal resolutions. When the velocity data are at 1/4096 the\nspatiotemporal resolution of DNS, the correlation coefficient between the true\nand adjoint-variational estimated state exceeds 99 percent. The robustness of\nthe algorithm to observation noise is demonstrated. In addition, the impact of\nthe spatiotemporal density of the data on estimation quality is evaluated, and\na resolution threshold is established for a successful reconstruction. The\ncritical spanwise data resolution is proportional to the Taylor microscale,\nwhich characterizes the domain of dependence of an observation location. Due to\nmean advection, either the streamwise or temporal data resolution must satisfy\na criterion based on the streamwise Taylor microscale. A second configuration\nis considered where the sub-sampled data are comprised of velocities in the\nouter layer and wall shear stresses only. The near-wall flow statistics and\ncoherent structures, although not sampled, are accurately reconstructed, which\nis possible because of the coupling between the outer flow and near-wall\nmotions. Finally, the most challenging configuration is addressed where only\nthe spatiotemporally resolved wall stresses are observed. The estimation\nremains accurate within the viscous sublayer and deteriorates significantly\nwith distance from the wall. In wall units, this trend is nearly independent of\nthe Reynolds number considered, and is indicative of the fundamental difficulty\nof reconstructing wall-detached motions from wall data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Nov 2020 06:53:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-01"}

Such a graph is temporally connected if\neach ordered pair of vertices is connected by a path which traverses edges in\nchronological order (i.e., a temporal path). In this paper, we consider a\nsimple model of random temporal graph, obtained from an Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi\nrandom graph $G~G_{n,p}$ by considering a random permutation $\\pi$ of the edges\nand interpreting the ranks in $\\pi$ as presence times.

Furthermore,\nthe graph admits a temporal spanner of size $2n+o(n)$ as soon as it becomes\ntemporally connected, which is nearly optimal as $2n-4$ is a lower bound. This\nresult is significant because temporal graphs do not admit spanners of size\n$O(n)$ in general (Kempe et al, STOC 2000). In fact, they do not even admit\nspanners of size $o(n^2)$ (Axiotis et al, ICALP 2016).

However,\nmost of them rely on a single structure/system (e.g., bone-only) and ignore the\nfact that the human hand is composed of multiple functional structures (e.g.,\nskin, bones, muscles, and tendons). This not only increases the difficulty of\nthe design process but also lowers the robustness and flexibility of the\nfabricated hand. Besides, other factors like customization, the time and cost\nfor production, and the degree of resemblance between human hands and robotic\nhands, remain omitted. To tackle these problems, this study proposes a 3D\nprintable multi-layer design that models the hand with the layers of skin,\ntissues, and bones. The proposed design first obtains the 3D surface model of a\ntarget hand via 3D scanning, and then generates the 3D bone models from the\nsurface model based on a fast template matching method. To overcome the\ndisadvantage of the rigid bone layer in deformation, the tissue layer is\nintroduced and represented by a concentric tube based structure, of which the\ndeformability can be explicitly controlled by a parameter. Besides, a low-cost\nyet effective underactuated system is adopted to drive the fabricated hand. The\nproposed design is tested with 33 widely used object grasping types, as well as\nspecial objects like fragile silken tofu, and outperforms previous designs\nremarkably. With the proposed design, anthropomorphic robotic hands can be\nproduced fast with low cost, and be customizable and deformable.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Nov 2020 10:14:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-20"}

A vision is to develop an intelligent privacy\nassistant to whom developers can easily ask questions in order to learn how to\nincorporate different privacy-preserving ideas into their IoT application\ndesigns. This paper lays the foundations toward developing such a privacy\nassistant by synthesising existing PbD knowledge so as to elicit requirements.\nIt is believed that such a privacy assistant should not just prescribe a list\nof privacy-preserving ideas that developers should incorporate into their\ndesign. Instead, it should explain how each prescribed idea helps to protect\nprivacy in a given application design context-this approach is defined as\n'Explainable Privacy'. A total of 74 privacy patterns were analysed and\nreviewed using ten different PbD schemes to understand how each privacy pattern\nis built and how each helps to ensure privacy. Due to page limitations, we have\npresented a detailed analysis in [3]. In addition, different real-world\nInternet of Things (IoT) use-cases, including a healthcare application, were\nused to demonstrate how each privacy pattern could be applied to a given\napplication design. By doing so, several knowledge engineering requirements\nwere identified that need to be considered when developing a privacy assistant.\nIt was also found that, when compared to other IoT application domains, privacy\npatterns can significantly benefit healthcare applications.

We propose that such a association could be\ninterpreted as arising from hadronic interactions between relativistic protons\naccelerated in the jet launched from the TDE and the intense radiation field of\nTDE inside the optical/UV photosphere, if we are observing the jet at a\nmoderate angle (i.e., approximately 10-30 degree) with respect to the jet axis.\nSuch an off-axis viewing angle leads to a high gas column density in the line\nof sight which provides a high opacity for the photoionization and the\nBethe-Heitler process, {and allows the existence of an intrinsic long-term\nX-ray radiation of comparatively high emissivity}. As a result, the cascade\nemission accompanying the neutrino production, which would otherwise overshoot\nthe flux limits in X-ray and/or GeV band, is significantly obscured or\nabsorbed. Since the jets of TDEs are supposed to be randomly oriented in the\nsky, the source density rate of TDE with an off-axis jet is significantly\nhigher than that of TDE with an on-axis jet. Therefore, an off-axis jet is\nnaturally expected in a nearby TDE being discovered, supporting the proposed\nscenario.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 7 Nov 2020 13:17:46 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-18"}

The approach is based\non an original concept: the analysis of the probability that a photon entering\nthe reaction volume is absorbed by the actinometer. Whereas this probability is\nassumed to be equal to one in classical actinometry, this assumption can no\nlonger be satisfied in many practical situations in which optical thicknesses\nare low. Here we remove this restriction by using most recent advances in the\nfield of radiative transfer Monte Carlo, in order to rigorously evaluate the\ninstantaneous absorption-probability as a function of conversion.\nImplementation is performed in EDStar, an open-source development environment\nthat enables straightforward simulation of reactors with any geometry (directly\nprovided by their CAD-file), with the very same Monte Carlo algorithm.\nExperimental investigations are focused on Reinecke salt photodissociation in\ntwo reactors designed for the study of natural and artificial photosynthesis.\nThe first reactor investigated serves as reference configuration: its simple\ntorus geometry allows to compare flux densities measured with quantum sensors\nand actinometry.

Across existing\ndefense techniques, adversarial training with the projected gradient decent\nattack (adv.PGD) is considered as one of the most effective ways to achieve\nmoderate adversarial robustness. However, adv.PGD requires too much training\ntime since the projected gradient attack (PGD) takes multiple iterations to\ngenerate perturbations. On the other hand, adversarial training with the fast\ngradient sign method (adv.FGSM) takes much less training time since the fast\ngradient sign method (FGSM) takes one step to generate perturbations but fails\nto increase adversarial robustness.

Stencil\ncomputations are prevalent in scientific applications engaging a significant\nportion of supercomputing resources. Therefore, it has been always important to\noptimize stencil programs for the best performance. A rich body of research has\nfocused on optimizing stencil computations on almost all parallel\narchitectures. Stencil applications have regular dependency patterns, inherent\npipeline-parallelism, and plenty of data reuse. This makes these applications a\nperfect match for a coarse-grained reconfigurable spatial architecture (CGRA).\nA CGRA consists of many simple, small processing elements (PEs) connected with\nan on-chip network. Each PE can be configured to execute part of a stencil\ncomputation and all PEs run in parallel; the network can also be configured so\nthat data loaded can be passed from a PE to a neighbor PE directly and thus\nreused by many PEs without register spilling and memory traffic.

The ECGM first\ncollects ECG signals from the fabric electrodes adhered to wearers' chest,\npreprocesses the signals to eliminate the injected noise, and then transmit the\noutput data to wearers' hand-held mobile phones through Bluetooth low energy\n(BLE). The wearers are enabled to acquire ECGs and other physiological\nparameters on their phones as well as some corresponding suggestions. The\nnovelty of the system lies in the combination of low-power ECG sensor chip with\nferroelectric microprocessor, thus achieving ultra-low power consumption and\nhigh signal quality.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 6 Nov 2020 16:34:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-07"}
