Although deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have\nwidely applied to this task, the accuracy of these models still need to be\nfurther improved mainly due to their limited ability to 3D context perception.\nIn this paper, we propose the 3D context residual network (ConResNet) for the\naccurate segmentation of 3D medical images. This model consists of an encoder,\na segmentation decoder, and a context residual decoder. We design the context\nresidual module and use it to bridge both decoders at each scale. Each context\nresidual module contains both context residual mapping and context attention\nmapping, the formal aims to explicitly learn the inter-slice context\ninformation and the latter uses such context as a kind of attention to boost\nthe segmentation accuracy. We evaluated this model on the MICCAI 2018 Brain\nTumor Segmentation (BraTS) dataset and NIH Pancreas Segmentation (Pancreas-CT)\ndataset. Our results not only demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed 3D\ncontext residual learning scheme but also indicate that the proposed ConResNet\nis more accurate than six top-ranking methods in brain tumor segmentation and\nseven top-ranking methods in pancreas segmentation.

The model is characterized by a Euclidean exclusion distance\n$D>0$ and a value of fugacity $u>0$. We use the Pirogov-Sinai theory to study\nthe Gibbs distributions for a general $D$ when $u$ is large: $u>u_0(D)$. For\ninfinite sequences of values $D$ we describe a complete high-density phase\ndiagram: it exhibits a multitude of co-existing pure phases, and their number\ngrows as $O(D^2)$. For the remaining values of $D$, except for those with\nsliding, the number of co-existing pure phases is still of the form $E(D)\\geq\nO(D^2)$; however, the exact identification of the pure phases requires an\nadditional analysis. Such an analysis is performed for a number of typical\nexamples, which involves computer-assisted proofs. Consequently, for all values\n$D>0$ where sliding does not occur, we establish the existence of a phase\ntransition.\n  The crucial steps in the study are (i) the identification of periodic ground\nstates and (ii) the verification of the Peierls bound. This is done by using\nconnections with algebraic number theory. In particular, a complete list of\nso-called sliding values of $D$ has been specified. As a by-product, we solve\nthe disk-packing problem on the lattices under consideration. The number and\nstructure of maximally-dense packings depend on the disk-diameter $D$, unlike\nthe case of $\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Nov 2020 16:08:45 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 11 Oct 2022 01:30:34 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-10-12"}

To model the atomic configuration of a-Si on c-Si, melting and quenching\nsimulations were performed using classical molecular dynamics (MD). Different\nhydrogen contents were inserted into the a-Si in different bonding\nconfigurations followed by DFT relaxation to create the stable structures of\na-Si:H representative of hydrogenated a-Si on crystalline Si surfaces. In\ncontrast to crystalline heterojunctions (where the interface density is a\nmaximum at the interface), we find that, in the most energetically stable\nconfigurations of H atoms, the defect state density is relatively low at the\ninterface and maximum at the middle of a-Si layer. Our structural analysis\nshows that in these configurations, H atoms do not necessarily bond to dangling\nbonds or to interface atoms. However, they are able to significantly change the\natomic structure of the heterostructure and consequently decrease the density\nof defect states and orbital localization at the a-Si layer and more\nsignificantly at the interface of a-Si/c-Si.

The traction-separation relations (TSR)\nquantitatively describe the mechanical behavior of a material interface\nundergoing openings, which is critical to understand and predict interfacial\nfailures under complex loadings. However, existing theoretical models have\nlimitations on enough complexity and flexibility to well learn the real-world\nTSR from experimental observations. A neural network can fit well along with\nthe loading paths but often fails to obey the laws of physics, due to a lack of\nexperimental data and understanding of the hidden physical mechanism. In this\npaper, we propose a thermodynamic consistent neural network (TCNN) approach to\nbuild a data-driven model of the TSR with sparse experimental data. The TCNN\nleverages recent advances in physics-informed neural networks (PINN) that\nencode prior physical information into the loss function and efficiently train\nthe neural networks using automatic differentiation. We investigate three\nthermodynamic consistent principles, i.e., positive energy dissipation,\nsteepest energy dissipation gradient, and energy conservative loading path. All\nof them are mathematically formulated and embedded into a neural network model\nwith a novel defined loss function. A real-world experiment demonstrates the\nsuperior performance of TCNN, and we find that TCNN provides an accurate\nprediction of the whole TSR surface and significantly reduces the violated\nprediction against the laws of physics.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Nov 2020 17:25:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-01"}

Two computational\nchallenges have limited the applicability of TO to a variety of industrial\napplications. First, a TO problem often involves a large number of design\nvariables to guarantee sufficient expressive power. Second, many TO problems\nrequire a large number of expensive physical model simulations, and those\nsimulations cannot be parallelized. To address these issues, we propose a\ngeneral scalable deep-learning (DL) based TO framework, referred to as SDL-TO,\nwhich utilizes parallel schemes in high performance computing (HPC) to\naccelerate the TO process for designing additively manufactured (AM) materials.\nUnlike the existing studies of DL for TO, our framework accelerates TO by\nlearning the iterative history data and simultaneously training on the mapping\nbetween the given design and its gradient. The surrogate gradient is learned by\nutilizing parallel computing on multiple CPUs incorporated with a distributed\nDL training on multiple GPUs. The learned TO gradient enables a fast online\nupdate scheme instead of an expensive update based on the physical simulator or\nsolver. Using a local sampling strategy, we achieve to reduce the intrinsic\nhigh dimensionality of the design space and improve the training accuracy and\nthe scalability of the SDL-TO framework. The method is demonstrated by\nbenchmark examples and AM materials design for heat conduction. The proposed\nSDL-TO framework shows competitive performance compared to the baseline methods\nbut significantly reduces the computational cost by a speed up of around 8.6x\nover the standard TO implementation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Nov 2020 17:38:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-01"}

This study investigated the mechanical behaviour of\npolygrain-like meta-crystals fabricated from Ti6Al4V by laser powder bed\nfusion. The mechanical behaviour of Ti6Al4V meta-crystals is governed by\nlattice structures across length-scales: the crystalline microstructure,\narchitected crystal-like mesostructures and the quality of lattice struts. Due\nto the intricate architecture, significant processing defects were seen in the\nprinted meta-crystals, in particular notch-like defects due to lack of fusion\nat the free surface of struts. Such defects raised stress concentration and\nreduced the load-bearing area of struts, hence significantly weakening the\nlattice struts. In addition, the as-printed condition was brittle due to the\npresence of acicular alpha' martensites. The defects and the as-printed\nbrittleness led to the premature fracture of struts and compromised the\nbenefits of the crystal-inspired mesostructures. The study subsequently\nconducted multiple measures to resolve this issue: increasing the strut\ndiameter to reduce the influence of the process defects, and annealing to\nrelieve internal stresses and regain ductility. The combination of the increase\nin strut diameter and annealing successfully enabled the crystal-like\narchitected mesostructure to effectively improve the toughness of the\nmeta-crystals.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Nov 2020 19:13:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-01"}

Results reveal that SVR based prediction\nmodels gives the best forecasting performance out of all models. In addition,\ngradient boosted machines (GBM) predicts ramp events closer to Twin support\nvector regression (TSVR) model. Furthermore, the randomness in ramp power is\nevaluated for onshore and offshore wind farms by calculating log energy entropy\nof features obtained from wavelet decomposition and empirical model\ndecomposition.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Nov 2020 21:21:42 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-01"}

The\nspecific actuation schemes for this tensegrity robot with multiple degrees of\nfreedom are presented. This article describes an easy-to-assemble 350 mm\ntensegrity based robot prototype by stacking a series of rigid struts linked\nwith tensegrity joints that have no direct rigid contact with each other. The\nfunctionality of the proposed robot is validated by the experimental results by\nintegrating the polyhedral parallel structure as its skeleton and series of\ntensegrity joints. The proposed manipulator is capable of reaching bending\nangles up to 76 degrees. An adaptive cable driven underactuated robotic gripper\nis designed and attached to the tensegrity manipulator for grasping objects in\ndifferent shapes, weights, and sizes.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Nov 2020 00:13:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-07"}

Computational methods offer promise for rapidly screening such\nproducts for potential SARS-CoV-2 activity by predicting and ranking the\naffinities of these compounds for specific virus protein targets. The\nRNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) is a promising target for SARS-CoV-2 drug\ndevelopment given it has no human homologs making RdRP inhibitors potentially\nsafer, with fewer off-target effects that drugs targeting other viral proteins.\nWe combined robust Vina docking on RdRP with molecular dynamic (MD) simulation\nof the top 80 identified drug candidates to yield a list of the most promising\nRdRP inhibitors. Literature reviews revealed that many of the predicted\ninhibitors had been shown to have activity in in vitro assays or had been\npredicted by other groups to have activity.

In particular, we present a\nnew requirement about the lower bound of sampling rate to ensure exact recovery\nof original signals from quantized modulo samples. The minimum sampling rate is\njointly determined by signal bandwidth and quantization bits. Numerical results\nshow that in the presence of quantization noise, signals with different\nwaveforms and bandwidths are recovered perfectly at the new minimum sampling\nrate while the recovery fails at minimum sampling rate before modification,\nwhich also verifies the correctness of the theory.

The numerical solution of the nonlinear PBE is known to involve\nmany difficulties, such as exponential nonlinear term, strong singularity by\nthe source terms, and complex dielectric interface. Recently, a pseudo-time\nghost-fluid method (GFM) has been developed in [S. Ahmed Ullah and S. Zhao,\nApplied Mathematics and Computation, 380, 125267, (2020)], by analytically\nhandling both nonlinearity and singular sources. The GFM interface treatment\nnot only captures the discontinuity in the regularized potential and its flux\nacross the molecular surface, but also guarantees the stability and efficiency\nof the time integration. However, the molecular surface definition based on the\nMSMS package is known to induce instability in some cases, and a nontrivial\nLagrangian-to-Eulerian conversion is indispensable for the GFM finite\ndifference discretization. In this paper, an Eulerian Solvent Excluded Surface\n(ESES) is implemented to replace the MSMS for defining the dielectric\ninterface. The electrostatic analysis shows that the ESES free energy is more\naccurate than that of the MSMS, while being free of instability issues.\nMoreover, this work explores, for the first time in the PBE literature,\nadaptive time integration techniques for the pseudo-transient simulations. A\nmajor finding is that the time increment $\\Delta t$ should become smaller as\nthe time increases, in order to maintain the temporal accuracy. This is\nopposite to the common practice for the steady state convergence, and is\nbelieved to be due to the PBE nonlinearity and its time splitting treatment.\nEffective adaptive schemes have been constructed so that the pseudo-time GFM\nmethods become more efficient than the constant $\\Delta t$ ones.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Nov 2020 01:37:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-01"}

In this\nway, the model is enabled to learn more discriminative and less\nsimilarity-biased features from few shots of fine-grained images, such that the\nmodel generalization ability can be significantly improved. Through extensive\nexperiments by slightly modifying established metric/similarity based networks,\nwe show that the proposed approach produces a substantial improvement on\nseveral fine-grained image benchmark datasets.

Using the generalized spin-wave theory and\nBoltzmann transport equation, we find that a spin current generated by a\nthermal gradient is observed in the excitonic insulating state without magnetic\nfields. The spin Seebeck effect originates from spin-split collective\nexcitation modes although the ground state does not exhibit any magnetic\norderings. This peculiar phenomenon is inherent in the excitonic insulating\nstate, whose order parameter is time-reversal odd and yields a spin splitting\nfor the collective excitation modes.

However, compared with\nfilter pruning and weight pruning, the compact model obtained by layer pruning\nhas less inference time and run-time memory usage when the same FLOPs and\nnumber of parameters are pruned because of less data moving in memory. In this\npaper, we propose a simple layer pruning method using fusible residual\nconvolutional block (ResConv), which is implemented by inserting shortcut\nconnection with a trainable information control parameter into a single\nconvolutional layer. Using ResConv structures in training can improve network\naccuracy and train deep plain networks, and adds no additional computation\nduring inference process because ResConv is fused to be an ordinary\nconvolutional layer after training. For layer pruning, we convert convolutional\nlayers of network into ResConv with a layer scaling factor.

As a\nstate-of-the-art graph neural network, the graph convolutional network (GCN)\nplays an important role in processing graph-structured data. However, a recent\nstudy reported that GCNs are also vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which\nmeans that GCN models may suffer malicious attacks with unnoticeable\nmodifications of the data. Among all the adversarial attacks on GCNs, there is\na special kind of attack method called the universal adversarial attack, which\ngenerates a perturbation that can be applied to any sample and causes GCN\nmodels to output incorrect results. Although universal adversarial attacks in\ncomputer vision have been extensively researched, there are few research works\non universal adversarial attacks on graph structured data. In this paper, we\npropose a targeted universal adversarial attack against GCNs. Our method\nemploys a few nodes as the attack nodes. The attack capability of the attack\nnodes is enhanced through a small number of fake nodes connected to them.\nDuring an attack, any victim node will be misclassified by the GCN as the\nattack node class as long as it is linked to them. The experiments on three\npopular datasets show that the average attack success rate of the proposed\nattack on any victim node in the graph reaches 83% when using only 3 attack\nnodes and 6 fake nodes. We hope that our work will make the community aware of\nthe threat of this type of attack and raise the attention given to its future\ndefense.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Nov 2020 13:19:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-01"}

Results: AUC maps resulting from the analysis present the\narea under the ROC curve over the whole 2D frequency space for the different\ndoses and beam qualities.

However, clinical evidence\nsuggests that COVID-19 can result in non-mortal complications that affect\npatient prognosis. To support patient risk stratification, we aimed to develop\na prognostic system that predicts complications common to COVID-19. In this\nretrospective study, we used data collected from 3,352 COVID-19 patient\nencounters admitted to 18 facilities between April 1 and April 30, 2020, in Abu\nDhabi (AD), UAE. The hospitals were split based on geographical proximity to\nassess for our proposed system's learning generalizability, AD Middle region\nand AD Western & Eastern regions, A and B, respectively. Using data collected\nduring the first 24 hours of admission, the machine learning-based prognostic\nsystem predicts the risk of developing any of seven complications during the\nhospital stay. The complications include secondary bacterial infection, AKI,\nARDS, and elevated biomarkers linked to increased patient severity, including\nd-dimer, interleukin-6, aminotransferases, and troponin. During training, the\nsystem applies an exclusion criteria, hyperparameter tuning, and model\nselection for each complication-specific model. The system achieves good\naccuracy across all complications and both regions. In test set A (587 patient\nencounters), the system achieves 0.91 AUROC for AKI and >0.80 AUROC for most of\nthe other complications. In test set B (225 patient encounters), the respective\nsystem achieves 0.90 AUROC for AKI, elevated troponin, and elevated\ninterleukin-6, and >0.80 AUROC for most of the other complications. The best\nperforming models, as selected by our system, were mainly gradient boosting\nmodels and logistic regression. Our results show that a data-driven approach\nusing machine learning can predict the risk of such complications with high\naccuracy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 28 Nov 2020 18:16:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-03"}

As a\nconsequence, the model tends to overfit the input set. In this research, we\nsuggest the D-vine Copula Auto-Encoder (VCAE) as a tool to estimate the latent\nspace distribution under the presence of backdoor triggers. Since no\nassumptions are made on the distribution estimation, like in Variational\nAutoencoders (VAE). It is possible to observe the backdoor stamp in\nnon-attacked categories randomly generated. We exhibit the differences between\na clean model (baseline) and the attacked one (backdoor) in a pairwise\nrepresentation of the distribution.

We assess the\nquality of synthetic data generated by two GAN models for chest radiographs\nwith 14 different radiology findings and brain computed tomography (CT) scans\nwith six types of intracranial hemorrhages. We measure the synthetic image\nquality by the performance difference of predictive models trained on either\nthe synthetic or the real dataset.

To complete\nuncertainty analysis in a multi-scale manner, it is a prerequisite to provide\nsufficient rock samples. Even though the advent of digital rock technology\noffers opportunities to reproduce rocks, it still cannot be utilized to provide\nmassive samples due to its high cost, thus leading to the development of\ndiversified mathematical methods. Among them, two-point statistics (TPS) and\nmulti-point statistics (MPS) are commonly utilized, which feature incorporating\nlow-order and high-order statistical information, respectively. Recently,\ngenerative adversarial networks (GANs) are becoming increasingly popular since\nthey can reproduce training images with excellent visual and consequent\ngeologic realism. However, standard GANs can only incorporate information from\ndata, while leaving no interface for user-defined properties, and thus may\nlimit the representativeness of reconstructed samples. In this study, we\npropose conditional GANs for digital rock reconstruction, aiming to reproduce\nsamples not only similar to the real training data, but also satisfying\nuser-specified properties. In fact, the proposed framework can realize the\ntargets of MPS and TPS simultaneously by incorporating high-order information\ndirectly from rock images with the GANs scheme, while preserving low-order\ncounterparts through conditioning. We conduct three reconstruction experiments,\nand the results demonstrate that rock type, rock porosity, and correlation\nlength can be successfully conditioned to affect the reconstructed rock images.\nFurthermore, in contrast to existing GANs, the proposed conditioning enables\nlearning of multiple rock types simultaneously, and thus invisibly saves\ncomputational cost.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 29 Nov 2020 10:55:58 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 1 Jun 2021 06:32:43 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-06-14"}
