We show that the random counting measure may be used\nto construct positive random fields, which admit decompositions of covariance\nand sensitivity indices and may be used to represent interacting particle\nsystems. The first and second order global sensitivity analyses conveyed\nthrough random counting measures elucidate and integrate different notions of\nuncertainty quantification, and the global sensitivity analysis of random\nfields conveys the proportionate functional contributions to covariance. This\nframework complements others when used in conjunction with for instance\nalgorithmic uncertainty and model selection uncertainty frameworks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2020 18:31:28 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Nov 2020 22:11:08 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 2 Dec 2020 16:12:52 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 31 Dec 2020 20:06:09 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-05"}

Multiple biclustering\nalgorithms have been developed in the past two decades, among which the convex\nbiclustering can guarantee a global optimum by formulating in as a convex\noptimization problem. On the other hand, the application of biclustering has\nnot progressed in parallel with the algorithm techniques. For example,\nbiclustering for increasingly popular microbiome research data is under-applied\npossibly due to its compositional constraints for each sample. In this\nmanuscript, we propose a new convex biclustering algorithm, called the bi-ADMM,\nunder general setups based on the ADMM algorithm, which is free of extra\nsmoothing steps to visualize informative biclusters required by existing convex\nbiclustering algorithms. Furthermore, we tailor it to the algorithm named\nbiC-ADMM specifically to tackle compositional constraints confronted in\nmicrobiome data. The key step of our methods utilizes the Sylvester Equation to\nderive the ADMM algorithm, which is new to the clustering research. The\neffectiveness of the proposed methods is examined through a variety of\nnumerical experiments and a microbiome data application.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2020 16:02:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 8 Jun 2021 17:02:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-09"}

We report on ESPRESSO high-resolution transmission spectroscopic\nobservations of two primary transits of the highly-irradiated, ultra-hot\nJupiter-size planet WASP-76b. We investigate the presence of several key atomic\nand molecular features of interest that may reveal the atmospheric properties\nof the planet. Methods. We extracted two transmission spectra of WASP-76b with\nR approx 140,000 using a procedure that allowed us to process the full ESPRESSO\nwavelength range (3800-7880 A) simultaneously. We observed that at a high\nsignal-to-noise ratio, the continuum of ESPRESSO spectra shows wiggles that are\nlikely caused by an interference pattern outside the spectrograph. To search\nfor the planetary features, we visually analysed the extracted transmission\nspectra and cross-correlated the observations against theoretical spectra of\ndifferent atomic and molecular species. Results. The following atomic features\nare detected: Li I, Na I, Mg I, Ca II, Mn I, K I, and Fe I. All are detected\nwith a confidence level between 9.2 sigma (Na I) and 2.8 sigma (Mg I).

While the mean CCF\nis universal, its (static) variance has previously been found to depend on the\nmicroscopic details of the system which effectively set a large-momentum cutoff\nin the underlying field theory, rendering it potentially large. This raises the\nquestion how the properties of the force variance are reflected in\nexperimentally observable quantities, such as the thickness of a wetting film\nor the position of a suspended colloidal particle. Here, based on a rigorous\ndefinition of the instantaneous force, we analyze static and dynamic\ncorrelations of the CCF for a conserved fluid in film geometry for various\nboundary conditions within the Gaussian approximation. We find that the dynamic\ncorrelation function of the CCF is independent of the momentum cutoff and\ndecays algebraically in time. Within the Gaussian approximation, the associated\nexponent depends only on the dynamic universality class but not on the boundary\nconditions. We furthermore consider a fluid film, the thickness of which can\nfluctuate under the influence of the time-dependent CCF. The latter gives rise\nto an effective non-Markovian noise in the equation of motion of the film\nboundary and induces a distinct contribution to the position variance. Within\nthe approximations used here, at short times, this contribution grows\nalgebraically in time whereas, at long times, it saturates and contributes to\nthe steady-state variance of the film thickness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2020 17:03:53 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 15 Apr 2021 21:11:32 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Thu, 17 Jun 2021 20:35:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-21"}

In OTFS based systems, information\nsymbols are embedded in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain where they are jointly\nmodulated to generate the time-domain transmit signal. Due to the multi-path\ndelay and Doppler shifts, the DD domain information symbols need to be jointly\ndemodulated at the receiver. For multi-carrier based communication (e.g.,\nOrthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)), massive MIMO systems have\nbeen shown to achieve high spectral and energy efficiency with low complexity\nmulti-user precoding in the downlink. Extending the same to OTFS based downlink\nmulti-user massive MIMO systems is challenging due to the requirement for joint\ndemodulation of all information symbols at the user terminal (UT). In this\npaper, we solve this problem by proposing a novel OTFS based multi-user\nprecoder at the base station (BS) and a corresponding low complexity detector\n(LCD) at the user terminals (UTs), which allows for separate demodulation of\neach DD domain information symbol at the UT. The complexity of the proposed\nprecoder increases only linearly with increasing number BS antennas Q and the\nnumber of UTs. We show, through analysis, that as Q increases (with total\ntransmitted power decreased linearly with Q), the proposed low complexity\ndetector achieves a sum SE close to that achieved with optimal joint\ndemodulation at each UT. Numerical simulations confirm our analysis and also\nshow that the SE and error rate performance of the proposed OTFS based massive\nMIMO precoder and LCD detector is significantly more robust to channel induced\nDoppler spread when compared to OFDM based multi-user massive MIMO systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2020 17:29:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-25"}

This raises strong concerns on their\ngeneralizability -- a must-have for downstream applications where the magnitude\nof domains or event mentions is likely to exceed those found in a curated\ncorpus. To investigate this assumption, we define a uniform evaluation setup\ninvolving three CDCR corpora: ECB+, the Gun Violence Corpus and the Football\nCoreference Corpus (which we reannotate on token level to make our analysis\npossible). We compare a corpus-independent, feature-based system against a\nrecent neural system developed for ECB+. Whilst being inferior in absolute\nnumbers, the feature-based system shows more consistent performance across all\ncorpora whereas the neural system is hit-and-miss. Via model introspection, we\nfind that the importance of event actions, event time, etc. for resolving\ncoreference in practice varies greatly between the corpora. Additional analysis\nshows that several systems overfit on the structure of the ECB+ corpus. We\nconclude with recommendations on how to achieve generally applicable CDCR\nsystems in the future -- the most important being that evaluation on multiple\nCDCR corpora is strongly necessary. To facilitate future research, we release\nour dataset, annotation guidelines, and system implementation to the public.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2020 17:45:03 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Jun 2021 18:06:08 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-14"}

To identify\nnew spCV candidates, we crossmatch a catalog of known CVs to sources with\nrobust parallaxes in the Gaia second data release (DR2). We uncover and fit an\napparently monotonic relationship between the color--absolute-magnitude diagram\n(CMD) position and $P_{orb}$ of these CVs, revealed in DR2. To supplement this\nrelation, we develop a method for identifying sources with large photometric\nvariability, a characteristic trait of spCVs. Using all available Gaia light\ncurves, we construct a machine-learned regression model to predict variability\nmetrics for sources in the CMD locus of known spCVs based solely on\ntime-averaged covariates present in DR2. Using this approach we identify 3,253\ncandidate spCVs, of which $\\sim$95% are previously unknown. Inspection of\narchival SDSS spectra of these candidates suggests that $>$82% are likely to be\nspCVs: a noticeably higher recovery rate than previous light curve searches,\nwhich bias toward active systems.

Understanding the conditions for anti-concentration is\nimportant for determining which quantum circuits are difficult to simulate\nclassically, as anti-concentration has been in some cases an ingredient of\nmathematical arguments that simulation is hard and in other cases a necessary\ncondition for easy simulation. Our definition of anti-concentration is that the\nexpected collision probability, that is, the probability that two independently\ndrawn outcomes will agree, is only a constant factor larger than if the\ndistribution were uniform. We show that when the 2-local gates are each drawn\nfrom the Haar measure (or any two-design), at least $\\Omega(n \\log(n))$ gates\n(and thus $\\Omega(\\log(n))$ circuit depth) are needed for this condition to be\nmet on an $n$ qudit circuit.

We relax these hypotheses and\ninvestigate the growth of a plane-strain hydraulic fracture in an impermeable\nmedium accounting for a rough cohesive zone and a fluid lag. In addition to a\ndimensionless toughness and the time-scale of coalescence of the fluid and\nfracture fronts as in the LHFM case, the solution now also depends on the\nin-situ-to-cohesive stress ratio and the intensity of the flow deviation\ninduced by aperture roughness. The solution is appropriately described by a\nnucleation time-scale, which delineates the fracture growth into a nucleation\nphase, an intermediate stage and a late time stage where convergence toward\nLHFM predictions finally occurs. A highly non-linear hydro-mechanical coupling\ntakes place as the fluid front enters the rough cohesive zone which itself\nevolves during the nucleation and intermediate stages. This coupling leads to\nsignificant additional viscous flow dissipation. As a result, the fracture\nevolution deviates from LHFM solutions with shorter fracture lengths, larger\nwidths and net pressures. These deviations ultimately decrease at late times as\nthe lag and cohesive zone fractions both become smaller. The deviations\nincrease with larger dimensionless toughness and in-situ-to-cohesive stress\nratio, as both further localize viscous dissipation near the fluid front\nlocated in the rough cohesive zone. The convergence toward LHFM can occur at\nvery late time for realistic values of in-situ-to-cohesive stress ratio\nencountered at depth. The impact of a rough cohesive zone appears to be\nprominent for laboratory experiments and short in-situ injections in\nquasi-brittle rocks with ultimately a larger energy demand compared to LHFM\npredictions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2020 18:56:02 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-28"}

We\nhandle the extremely low FLOPs based upon two design principles: (a) avoiding\nthe reduction of network width by lowering the node connectivity, and (b)\ncompensating for the reduction of network depth by introducing more complex\nnon-linearity per layer. Firstly, we propose Micro-Factorized convolution to\nfactorize both pointwise and depthwise convolutions into low rank matrices for\na good tradeoff between the number of channels and input/output connectivity.\nSecondly, we propose a new activation function, named Dynamic Shift-Max, to\nimprove the non-linearity via maxing out multiple dynamic fusions between an\ninput feature map and its circular channel shift.

Furthermore, we observe that increasing\ncluster escape velocity corresponds to higher 2P fractions. Each of the\ncorrelations found is bimodal, with a different behaviour detected for low and\nhigh mass (or escape velocity) clusters. These correlations could be consistent\nwith an initial formation of more centrally concentrated 2P stars in deeper\ncluster potentials, followed by a long-term tidal stripping of stars from\nclusters outskirts. The latter are dominated by the more extended distributed\nfirst population (1P) stars, and therefore stronger tidal stripping would\npreferentially deplete the 1P population, raising the cluster 2P fraction. This\nalso suggests a tighter distribution of initial 2P fractions than observed\ntoday. In addition, higher escape velocities allow better retention of\nlow-velocity material ejected from 1P stars, providing an\nalternative/additional origin for the observed differences and the\ndistributions of 2P fractions amongst GCs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2020 19:00:00 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 18 May 2021 08:04:58 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-26"}

Too large a bar and bulge form when the gas is too\nhot, but this is avoided by reducing the gas temperature. A strong bar still\nforms in 1 Gyr, but rapidly weakens and becomes consistent with the observed\nweak bar. Previous work showed this to be challenging in Newtonian models with\na live dark matter halo, which developed strong bars. The bar pattern speed\nimplies a realistic corotation radius of 3 kpc. However, the RC still rises too\nsteeply, and the central line of sight velocity dispersion (LOSVD) is too high.\nWe then add a constant external acceleration field of $8.4 \\times 10^{-12}$\nm/s$^2$ at $30^\\circ$ to the disk as a first order estimate for the gravity\nexerted by M31. This suppresses buildup of material at the centre, causing the\nRC to rise more slowly and reducing the central LOSVD. Overall, this simulation\nbears good resemblance to several global properties of M33, and highlights the\nimportance of including even a weak external field on the stability and\nevolution of disk galaxies.

In the vicinity of a quantum\ncritical point, it is expected that some aspects of the dynamics are universal\nand dictated by properties of the critical point. We use gauge-gravity duality\nto investigate the breakdown of diffusive hydrodynamics in two low temperature\nstates dual to black holes with AdS$_2$ horizons, which exhibit quantum\ncritical dynamics with an emergent scaling symmetry in time. We find that the\nbreakdown is characterized by a collision between the diffusive pole of the\nretarded Green's function with a pole associated to the AdS$_2$ region of the\ngeometry, such that the local equilibration time is set by infra-red properties\nof the theory. The absolute values of the frequency and wavevector at the\ncollision ($\\omega_{eq}$ and $k_{eq}$) provide a natural characterization of\nall the low temperature diffusivities $D$ of the states via\n$D=\\omega_{eq}/k_{eq}^2$ where $\\omega_{eq}=2\\pi\\Delta T$ is set by the\ntemperature $T$ and the scaling dimension $\\Delta$ of an operator of the\ninfra-red quantum critical theory.

Our study indicates the presence of a strongly\ninteraction mode which implies a late-decoupling of the neutrinos just prior to\nmatter radiation equality.

However, the\nclose proximity of the water snowline to the host star and water in the Earth's\natmosphere makes a direct detection of the water snowline in protoplanetary\ndisks challenging. Following earlier work on protostellar envelopes, the aim of\nthis research is to investigate the validity of HCO$^+$ and H$^{13}$CO$^+$, as\ntracers of the water snowline in protoplanetary disks, as HCO$^+$ is destroyed\nby gas-phase water. Two small chemical networks are used to predict the HCO$^+$\nabundance in a typical Herbig Ae disk. Subsequently, the corresponding emission\nprofiles are modelled for H$^{13}$CO$^+$ and HCO$^+$ $J=2-1$, which provides\nthe best balance between brightness and optical depth effects of the continuum\nemission. The HCO$^+$ abundance jumps by two orders of magnitude just outside\nthe water snowline at 4.5 AU. We find that the emission of H$^{13}$CO$^+$ and\nHCO$^+$ is ring-shaped due to three effects: destruction of HCO$^+$ by\ngas-phase water, continuum optical depth, and molecular excitation effects. The\npresence of gas-phase water causes an additional drop of only $\\sim$13% and 24%\nin the center of the disk, for H$^{13}$CO$^+$ and HCO$^+$, respectively. For\nthe much more luminous outbursting source V883Ori, our models predict that the\neffect of dust and excitation are not limiting if the snowline is located\noutside $\\sim$40 AU. Our analysis of ALMA observations of HCO$^+$ $J=3-2$ is\nconsistent with the water snowline located around 100 AU. The HCO$^+$ abundance\ndrops steeply around the water snowline, but dust and excitation can conceal\nthe drop in HCO$^+$ emission due to the water snowline. Therefore, locating the\nwater snowline with HCO$^+$ in Herbig disks is very difficult, but it is\npossible for outbursting sources like V883Ori.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2020 19:00:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}

Genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 can provide insights on drug design\nand vaccine development for controlling the pandemic. Inverted repeats in a\ngenome greatly impact the stability of the genome structure and regulate gene\nexpression. Inverted repeats involve cellular evolution and genetic diversity,\ngenome arrangements, and diseases. Here, we investigate the inverted repeats in\nthe coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 genome. We found that SARS-CoV-2 genome has an\nabundance of inverted repeats. The inverted repeats are mainly located in the\ngene of the Spike protein. This result suggests the Spike protein gene\nundergoes recombination events, therefore, is essential for fast evolution.\nComparison of the inverted repeat signatures in human and bat coronaviruses\nsuggest that SARS-CoV-2 is mostly related SARS-related coronavirus,\nSARSr-CoV/RaTG13. The study also reveals that the recent SARS-related\ncoronavirus, SARSr-CoV/RmYN02, has a high amount of inverted repeats in the\nspike protein gene. Besides, this study demonstrates that the inverted repeat\ndistribution in a genome can be considered as the genomic signature.

We then propose a novel on-policy MARL\nalgorithm, PowerNet, in which each agent (DG) learns a control policy based on\n(sub-)global reward but local states from its neighboring agents. Motivated by\nthe fact that a local control from one agent has limited impact on agents\ndistant from it, we exploit a novel spatial discount factor to reduce the\neffect from remote agents, to expedite the training process and improve\nscalability. Furthermore, a differentiable, learning-based communication\nprotocol is employed to foster the collaborations among neighboring agents.

Specifically, we ask which\npriorities are such that the strategyproofness of deferred acceptance (DA) can\nbe recognized by agents unable to perform contingency reasoning, that is,\n\\emph{when is DA obviously strategyproof} (Li, 2017)?\n  We answer this question by completely characterizing those priorities which\nmake DA obviously strategyproof (OSP). This solves an open problem of Ashlagi\nand Gonczarowski, 2018. We find that when DA is OSP, priorities are either\nacyclic (Ergin, 2002), a restrictive condition which allows priorities to only\ndiffer on only two agents at a time, or contain an extremely limited cyclic\npattern where all priority lists are identical except for exactly two. We\nconclude that, for stable matching mechanisms, the tension between\nunderstandability (in the sense of OSP) and expressiveness of priorities is\nvery high.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2020 20:39:21 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 25 Feb 2021 20:36:22 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-01"}

In this paper, we\nfocus on a multivariate time series regression problem. Specifically, we aim to\nlearn mathematical mappings from multiple chronologically measured numerical\nvariables within a certain time interval S to multiple numerical variables of\ninterest over time interval T. Prior arts, including the multivariate\nregression model, the Seq2Seq model, and the functional linear models, suffer\nfrom several limitations. The first two types of models can only handle\nregularly observed time series. Besides, the conventional multivariate\nregression models tend to be biased and inefficient, as they are incapable of\nencoding the temporal dependencies among observations from the same time\nseries. The sequential learning models explicitly use the same set of\nparameters along time, which has negative impacts on accuracy. The\nfunction-on-function linear model in functional data analysis (a branch of\nstatistics) is insufficient to capture complex correlations among the\nconsidered time series and suffer from underfitting easily. In this paper, we\npropose a general functional mapping that embraces the function-on-function\nlinear model as a special case.

Recently, people have started to investigate on the\nnon-invasive evaluation of liver viability during its procurement using the\nliver surface thermal images. However, existing works include the background\nnoise in the thermal images and do not consider the cross-subject heterogeneity\nof livers, thus the viability evaluation accuracy can be affected. In this\npaper, we propose to use the irregular thermal data of the pure liver region,\nand the cross-subject liver evaluation information (i.e., the available\nviability label information in cross-subject livers), for the real-time\nevaluation of a new liver's viability. To achieve this objective, we extract\nfeatures of irregular thermal data based on tools from graph signal processing\n(GSP), and propose an online domain adaptation (DA) and classification\nframework using the GSP features of cross-subject livers. A multiconvex block\ncoordinate descent based algorithm is designed to jointly learn the\ndomain-invariant features during online DA and learn the classifier. Our\nproposed framework is applied to the liver procurement data, and classifies the\nliver viability accurately.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2020 21:42:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-26"}

In particular, a new field has recently emerged that is concerned\nwith the study of quantum systems based on single spins localized near point\ndefects in crystalline solids. One such system is the nitrogen-vacancy (NV)\ndefect in diamond. Initially used as an experimental breadboard for testing\nconcepts of quantum physics and quantum computation, the NV defect was soon\nproposed as a sensitive magnetometer, capable of detecting minute magnetic\nfields, down to ultimate level of single spins. This atomic-sized magnetometer\ncan be used as a standalone sensor, or integrated into an imaging system\nproviding spatial resolution down to the atomic scale. Diamond-based\ninstruments thus offer new pathways to probe the magnetism of matter from the\nmesoscale down to the nanoscale.

This two-step\nprocess has a degeneracy breaking effect: out of all the low-loss solutions in\nthe landscape, a network trained with DFA naturally converges to the solution\nwhich maximises gradient alignment. We also identify a key quantity underlying\nalignment in deep linear networks: the conditioning of the alignment matrices.\nThe latter enables a detailed understanding of the impact of data structure on\nalignment, and suggests a simple explanation for the well-known failure of DFA\nto train convolutional neural networks.

The two most successful\nneural architectures are LSTM and transformers, used in large pretrained\nlanguage models such as BERT. While cross-lingual approaches are on the rise,\nmost current NLP techniques are designed and applied to English, and\nless-resourced languages are lagging behind. In morphologically rich languages,\ninformation is conveyed through morphology, e.g., through affixes modifying\nstems of words.

As a testbed, we use three tasks available in\nmany less-resourced languages: named entity recognition (NER), dependency\nparsing (DP), and comment filtering (CF). We construct baselines involving LSTM\nand BERT models, which we adjust by adding additional input in the form of part\nof speech (POS) tags and universal features. We compare models across several\nlanguages from different language families. Our results suggest that adding\nmorphological features has mixed effects depending on the quality of features\nand the task. The features improve the performance of LSTM-based models on the\nNER and DP tasks, while they do not benefit the performance on the CF task. For\nBERT-based models, the morphological features only improve the performance on\nDP when they are of high quality while not showing practical improvement when\nthey are predicted. Even for high-quality features, the improvements are less\npronounced in language-specific BERT variants compared to massively\nmultilingual BERT models.

In this work, we propose an\ninvestigation into how affect could be incorporated to enhance machine learning\nbased interventions for climate change. We propose using affective agent-based\nmodelling for climate change as well as the use of a simulated climate change\nsocial dilemma to explore the potential benefits of affective machine learning\ninterventions. Behavioural and informational interventions can be a powerful\ntool in helping humans adopt mitigative behaviours. We expect that utilizing\naffective ML can make interventions an even more powerful tool and help\nmitigative behaviours become widely adopted.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2020 23:34:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-26"}

The use of process mining offers a promising way to help address\nthe need through utilizing event log data stored in information systems.

In this paper, we aim to tackle these research challenges by\ndeveloping a novel framework built upon a richer definition of organizational\nmodels coupling resource grouping with process execution knowledge. By\nintroducing notions of conformance checking for organizational models, the\nframework allows effective evaluation of organizational models, and therefore\nprovides a foundation for analyzing and improving resource grouping based on\nevent logs.

As drug sensitivity studies continue generating data,\na common question is whether the proposed predictors can further improve the\ngeneralization performance with more training data. We utilize empirical\nlearning curves for evaluating and comparing the data scaling properties of two\nneural networks (NNs) and two gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) models\ntrained on four drug screening datasets. The learning curves are accurately\nfitted to a power law model, providing a framework for assessing the data\nscaling behavior of these predictors. The curves demonstrate that no single\nmodel dominates in terms of prediction performance across all datasets and\ntraining sizes, suggesting that the shape of these curves depends on the unique\nmodel-dataset pair. The multi-input NN (mNN), in which gene expressions and\nmolecular drug descriptors are input into separate subnetworks, outperforms a\nsingle-input NN (sNN), where the cell and drug features are concatenated for\nthe input layer. In contrast, a GBDT with hyperparameter tuning exhibits\nsuperior performance as compared with both NNs at the lower range of training\nsizes for two of the datasets, whereas the mNN performs better at the higher\nrange of training sizes.

Refinement of these proposals, typically\nby box regression and classification in parallel, has been popularly adopted to\nboost tracking performance. However, it still meets problems when dealing with\ncomplex and dynamic background. Thus motivated, in this paper we introduce an\nimproved proposal refinement module, Cascaded Regression-Align-Classification\n(CRAC), which yields new state-of-the-art performances on many benchmarks.\n  First, having observed that the offsets from box regression can serve as\nguidance for proposal feature refinement, we design CRAC as a cascade of box\nregression, feature alignment and box classification. The key is to bridge box\nregression and classification via an alignment step, which leads to more\naccurate features for proposal classification with improved robustness. To\naddress the variation in object appearance, we introduce an\nidentification-discrimination component for box classification, which leverages\noffline reliable fine-grained template and online rich background information\nto distinguish the target from background. Moreover, we present pyramid\nRoIAlign that benefits CRAC by exploiting both the local and global cues of\nproposals.

In experiments on seven benchmarks including\nOTB-2015, UAV123, NfS, VOT-2018, TrackingNet, GOT-10k and LaSOT, our CRACT\nexhibits very promising results in comparison with state-of-the-art competitors\nand runs in real-time.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Nov 2020 02:18:33 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-26"}

For larger offsets\nthat may be attained in discs with a large pressure gradient or a small thermal\ndiffusivity, thermal torques tend toward an asymptotic value broadly compatible\nwith results from a dynamical friction calculation in an unsheared medium.

Congestion arises due to large volumes of passenger\nboardings and alightings at bottleneck stations, which may lead to increased\nstopping times at stations and consequent queuing of trains upstream, further\nreducing line throughput and implying an even greater accumulation of\npassengers at stations. Alleviating congestion requires control strategies such\nas regulating the inflow of passengers entering bottleneck stations. The\navailability of large-scale smartcard and train movement data from day-to-day\noperations facilitates the development of models that can inform such\nstrategies in a data-driven way. In this paper, we propose to model\nstation-level passenger-congestion via empirical passenger boarding-alightings\nand train flow relationships, henceforth, fundamental diagrams (FDs).

Even though this method was originally formulated\nfor shallow-water waves based on the conventional piston type wavemaker,\nextending its use to deeper water conditions provides a more practical and\ncomputationally cost efficient solution compared to other available numerical\nwave absorption alternatives. For this sake, absorption of unidirectional\nmonochromatic waves in a semi-infinite flume by means of a static wall is\ninvestigated theoretically and numerically. Moreover, implementation to a\npractical wave-structure interaction application is investigated numerically\nand experimentally. A phase-resolving numerical model based on the\nReynold-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations is implemented using the open\nsource C++ toolbox OpenFOAM. The study presents the performance of the\nstatic-boundary method, in a dimensionless manner, by limiting the depth at\nwhich the active-absorption conventional-piston velocity profile is introduced;\nas a function of incident wave conditions. Moreover, it is shown that the\nperformance of the static-boundary method can be significantly enhanced where\nwave reflection was reduced to about half of that of the conventional setup in\ndeep-water conditions. Furthermore, the absorption depth is correlated to the\nincident wave conditions; providing an optimization framework for the selection\nof the proper dimensions of an absorbing wall. Finally, wave-structure\ninteraction experimental tests were conducted to validate the numerical model\nperformance; which shows an acceptable agreement between the model and the\nexperimental observations. The proposed limiter is straight forward to be\napplied in pre-existing wave-structure interaction CFD solvers, without the\nneed of code modifications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Nov 2020 03:10:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-26"}

The\nproposed structure comprises a container containing horizontal and vertical\nchannels enabling dividable injection of water, and a cross-gap FSS. The\nnovelty of the design lies in its switchability among four different operating\nstates by injecting water or not into the water channels. When the container is\nempty, the structure acts as a polarization-intensive FSS with a -0.42 dB\ninsertion loss passband at 3.75 GHz. When the horizontal channel is filled with\nwater and there is no water in the vertical channel, this structure can be used\nas an FSR with single polarization selectivity. The FSR with -10 dB absorption\nband from 6.8 GHz to 18.8 GHz only allows certain polarized electromagnetic\n(EM) waves to pass at 3.1 GHz with an insertion loss of -0.78 dB, while another\npolarized EM wave cannot pass.

An apparent\ndisparity in mobility was found across estimated income groups. In particular,\nthere was a strong negative correlation ($\\rho$ = -0.90) between a traveler's\nestimated income and travel distance in April. Disparities in mobility\nadaptability were further shown since those in higher income brackets\nexperienced larger percentage drops in the radius of gyration and the number of\ndistinct visited locations than did those in lower income brackets. The\nfindings of this study suggest a need to understand the reasons behind the\nmobility inflexibility among low-income populations during the pandemic. The\nstudy illuminates an equity issue which may be of interest to policy makers and\nresearchers alike in the wake of an epidemic.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Nov 2020 04:26:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 14 Feb 2021 03:03:19 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 12 Mar 2021 21:57:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-16"}

Most of the prior efforts are\ndevoted to learning node embeddings with graph neural networks (GNNs), which\npreserve the signed network topology by message-passing along edges to\nfacilitate the downstream link prediction task. Nevertheless, the existing\ngraph-based approaches could hardly provide human-intelligible explanations for\nthe following three questions: (1) which neighbors to aggregate, (2) which path\nto propagate along, and (3) which social theory to follow in the learning\nprocess. To answer the aforementioned questions, in this paper, we investigate\nhow to reconcile the \\textit{balance} and \\textit{status} social rules with\ninformation theory and develop a unified framework, termed as Signed Infomax\nHyperbolic Graph (\\textbf{SIHG}). By maximizing the mutual information between\nedge polarities and node embeddings, one can identify the most representative\nneighboring nodes that support the inference of edge sign.

We show that, if the density of dumbbells is high, the\nGaussian soft-core interaction is actually screened and the static structures\nare well described by the ideal model without Gaussian soft-core interaction.\nWe also show that the relaxation moduli of interacting dumbbell systems\napproximately coincide to those of the non-interacting dumbbell systems. In the\nlow density systems, we observe the deviations from the ideal non-interacting\nsystems. For example, the relaxation moduli become relatively broad. However,\nthe relaxation moduli of such systems can be decomposed into the relaxation\nmodes by the Gaussian soft-core interaction and the bond.

From the\nscaling form of this extended object, we confirm that the higher-form symmetry\nis indeed spontaneously broken inside the paramagnetic, or quantum disordered\nphase (in the Landau sense), but remains symmetric in the ferromagnetic/ordered\nphase. At the Ising critical point, we find that the higher-form symmetry is\nalso spontaneously broken, even though the 0-form symmetry is preserved. We\ndiscuss examples where both the global 0-form symmetry and the dual higher-form\nsymmetry are preserved, in systems with a codimension-1 manifold of gapless\npoints in momentum space. These results provide non-trivial working examples of\nhigher-form symmetry operators, including the first computation of one-form\norder parameter in an interacting conformal field theory, and open the avenue\nfor their generic implementation in quantum many-body systems.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Nov 2020 06:41:57 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 18 Mar 2021 10:28:32 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-14"}

By linking\npayouts to a regional factor instead of individual loss, index insurance\nreduces monitoring costs, and alleviates the problems of moral hazard and\nadverse selection. Despite its theoretical appeal, demand for index insurance\nhas remained low in many developing countries, triggering a debate on the\ncauses of the low uptake. Surprisingly, there has been little discussion in\nthis debate about the experience in the United States. The US is an unique case\nas both farm-based and index-based products have been available for more than\ntwo decades. Furthermore, the number of insurance zones is very large, allowing\ninteresting comparisons over space. As in developing countries, the adoption of\nindex insurance is rather low -- less than than 5\\% of insured acreage. Does\nthis mean that we should give up on index insurance?\n  In this paper, we investigate the low take-up of index insurance in the US\nleveraging a field-level dataset for corn and soybean obtained from satellite\npredictions. While previous studies were based either on county aggregates or\non relatively small farm-level dataset, our satellite-derived data gives us a\nvery large number of fields (close to 1.8 million) comprised within a large\nnumber of index zones (600) observed over 20 years. To evaluate the suitability\nof index insurance, we run a large-scale simulation comparing the benefits of\nboth insurance schemes using a new measure of farm-equivalent risk coverage of\nindex insurance. We make two main contributions. First, we show that in our\nsimulations, demand for index insurance is unexpectedly high, at about 30\\% to\n40\\% of total demand. This result is robust to relaxing several assumptions of\nthe model and to using prospect theory instead of expected utility.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Nov 2020 06:42:05 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 7 Nov 2021 17:27:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-09"}

However, because\nof mechanically induced grain boundary migration, the achievable grain size\nreduction is not indefinite but tends to stagnate once sufficient strain has\nbeen applied. Consequently, addition of solute elements or second phase\nparticles offers the possibility to access the true nanocrystalline regime. Due\nto their low solubility and high mobility, interstitial elements are extremely\neffective at subduing boundary migration.

To make\nPerson Re-ID systems more practical and scalable, several cross-dataset domain\nadaptation methods have been proposed, which achieve high performance without\nthe labeled data from the target domain.

Managing efficient forecasting while ensuring the least\npossible prediction error is one of the main challenges posed in the grid\ntoday, considering the uncertainty and granularity in SG data. This paper\npresents a comprehensive and application-oriented review of state-of-the-art\nforecasting methods for SG systems along with recent developments in\nprobabilistic deep learning (PDL) considering different models and\narchitectures. Traditional point forecasting methods including statistical,\nmachine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) are extensively investigated in\nterms of their applicability to energy forecasting. In addition, the\nsignificance of hybrid and data pre-processing techniques to support\nforecasting performance is also studied.

However, existing encrypted federated\nlearning systems need a trusted third party to generate and distribute key\npairs to connected participants, making them unsuited for federated learning\nand vulnerable to security risks. Moreover, encrypting all model parameters is\ncomputationally intensive, especially for large machine learning models such as\ndeep neural networks. In order to mitigate these issues, we develop a\npractical, computationally efficient encryption based protocol for federated\ndeep learning, where the key pairs are collaboratively generated without the\nhelp of a third party. By quantization of the model parameters on the clients\nand an approximated aggregation on the server, the proposed method avoids\nencryption and decryption of the entire model. In addition, a threshold based\nsecret sharing technique is designed so that no one can hold the global private\nkey for decryption, while aggregated ciphertexts can be successfully decrypted\nby a threshold number of clients even if some clients are offline.

NLP researchers pride themselves on\ndeveloping language independent models and tools that can be applied to all\nhuman languages, e.g. machine translation systems can be built for a variety of\nlanguages using the same basic mechanisms and models. However, the reality is\nthat some languages do get more attention (e.g., English and Chinese) than\nothers (e.g., Hindi and Swahili). Arabic, the primary language of the Arab\nworld and the religious language of millions of non-Arab Muslims is somewhere\nin the middle of this continuum. Though Arabic NLP has many challenges, it has\nseen many successes and developments. Next we discuss Arabic's main challenges\nas a necessary background, and we present a brief history of Arabic NLP. We\nthen survey a number of its research areas, and close with a critical\ndiscussion of the future of Arabic NLP.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Nov 2020 10:45:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 26 Nov 2020 06:38:36 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 27 Sep 2021 07:13:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-09-28"}

A notion of genome assembly solution\nis that of an arc-covering walk of the graph. Since assembly graphs admit many\nsolutions, the goal is to find what is definitely present in all solutions, or\nwhat is safe. Most practical assemblers are based on heuristics having at their\ncore unitigs, namely paths whose internal nodes have unit in-degree and\nout-degree, and which are clearly safe. The long-standing open problem of\nfinding all the safe parts of the solutions was recently solved [RECOMB 2016]\nyielding a 60% increase in contig length. This safe and complete genome\nassembly algorithm was followed by other works improving the time bounds, as\nwell as extending the results for different notions of assembly solution.

The hydrostructure allows for simple characterisations of the\nexisting safe walks, and of their new practical versions. Almost all of our\ncharacterisations are directly adaptable to optimal verification algorithms,\nand simple enumeration algorithms.

In this\npaper, we propose a PriorGuided Local (PGL) self-supervised model that learns\nthe region-wise local consistency in the latent feature space. Specifically, we\nuse the spatial transformations, which produce different augmented views of the\nsame image, as a prior to deduce the location relation between two views, which\nis then used to align the feature maps of the same local region but being\nextracted on two views. Next, we construct a local consistency loss to minimize\nthe voxel-wise discrepancy between the aligned feature maps. Thus, our PGL\nmodel learns the distinctive representations of local regions, and hence is\nable to retain structural information. This ability is conducive to downstream\nsegmentation tasks. We conducted an extensive evaluation on four public\ncomputerized tomography (CT) datasets that cover 11 kinds of major human organs\nand two tumors.

The existing image quality\nassessment methods focused on images corrupted by common degradation types\nwhile little attention was paid to color quantization. This in spite there is a\nwide range of applications requiring color quantization assessment being used\nas a preprocessing step when color-based tasks are more efficiently\naccomplished on a reduced number of colors. In this paper, we propose and\ncarry-out a quantitative performance evaluation of nine well-known and commonly\nused full-reference image quality assessment measures. The evaluation is done\nby using two publicly available and subjectively rated image quality databases\nfor color quantization degradation and by considering suitable combinations or\nsubparts of them. The results indicate the quality measures that have closer\nperformances in terms of their correlation to the subjective human rating and\nshow that the evaluation of the statistical performance of the quality measures\nfor color quantization is significantly impacted by the selected image quality\ndatabase while maintaining a similar trend on each database. The detected\nstrong similarity both on individual databases and on databases obtained by\nintegration provides the ability to validate the integration process and to\nconsider the quantitative performance evaluation on each database as an\nindicator for performance on the other databases. The experimental results are\nuseful to address the choice of suitable quality measures for color\nquantization and to improve their future employment.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Nov 2020 11:25:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-10-12"}

Recent attempts either\nrely on explicit path reachability to leverage path-based semantic relatedness\nor graph neighborhood to learn heterogeneous network representations before\npredictions. These weakly coupled manners overlook the rich interactions among\nneighbor nodes, which introduces an early summarization issue. In this paper,\nwe propose GraphHINGE (Heterogeneous INteract and aggreGatE), which captures\nand aggregates the interactive patterns between each pair of nodes through\ntheir structured neighborhoods. Specifically, we first introduce\nNeighborhood-based Interaction (NI) module to model the interactive patterns\nunder the same metapaths, and then extend it to Cross Neighborhood-based\nInteraction (CNI) module to deal with different metapaths.

The data\nuploading performance of IoT network and the computational capacity of edge\nservers are entangled with each other in influencing the FL model training\nprocess. We propose a novel framework, called federated edge intelligence\n(FEI), that allows edge servers to evaluate the required number of data samples\naccording to the energy cost of the IoT network as well as their local data\nprocessing capacity and only request the amount of data that is sufficient for\ntraining a satisfactory model.

We also introduce a mapping\nfunction to quantify the computational load of edge servers under different\ncombinations of three key parameters: size of the dataset, local batch size,\nand number of local training passes.

In search of such topological superconductors, certain\ntopological insulators (like, Bi$_2$Se$_3$) were successfully turned into\nsuperconductors by metal-ion (Cu, Pd, Sr, Nb etc. ) intercalation.\nSuperconductivity could be induced in topological materials through applying\npressure as well. for example, a pressure-induced superconducting phase was\nfound in the topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$. However, in all such cases, no\nconclusive signature of topological superconductivity was found. In this\nreview, we will discuss about another novel way of inducing superconductivity\nin a non-superconducting topological material -- by creating a mesoscopic\ninterface on the material with a non-superconducting, normal metallic tip where\nthe mesoscopic interface becomes superconducting. Such a phase is now known as\na tip-induced superconducting (TISC) phase. This was first seen in 2014 on\nCd$_3$As$_2$ at IISER Mohali, India. Following that, a large number of other\ntopological materials were shown to display TISC. Since the TISC phase emerges\nonly at a confined region under a mesoscopic point contact, traditional bulk\ntools for characterizing superconductivity cannot be employed to detect/confirm\nsuch a phase. On the other hand, such a point contact geometry is ideal for\nprobing the possible existence of a temperature and magnetic field dependent\nsuperconducting energy gap and a temperature and magnetic field dependent\ncritical current. We will review the details of the experimental signatures\nthat can be used to prove the existence of superconductivity even when the\n\"text-book\" tests for detecting superconductivity cannot be performed.

While previous learning based reconstruction approaches\nperformed quite well, most of them estimate depth maps at a fixed resolution\nusing plane sweep volumes with a fixed depth hypothesis at each plane, which\nrequires densely sampled planes for desired accuracy and therefore is difficult\nto achieve high resolution depth maps. In this paper we introduce a\ncoarseto-fine depth inference strategy to achieve high resolution depth. This\nstrategy estimates the depth map at coarsest level, while the depth maps at\nfiner levels are considered as the upsampled depth map from previous level with\npixel-wise depth residual. Thus, we narrow the depth searching range with\npriori information from previous level and construct new cost volumes from the\npixel-wise depth residual to perform depth map refinement. Then the final depth\nmap could be achieved iteratively since all the parameters are shared between\ndifferent levels. At each level, the self-attention layer is introduced to the\nfeature extraction block for capturing the long range dependencies for depth\ninference task, and the cost volume is generated using similarity measurement\ninstead of the variance based methods used in previous work.

These PSEs are defined as contrasts\nbetween the expectations of 2^{K+1} potential outcomes and identified via what\nwe call the generalized mediation functional (GMF). We introduce an array of\nregression-imputation, weighting, and \"hybrid\" estimators, and, in particular,\ntwo K+2-robust and locally semiparametric efficient estimators for the GMF. The\nlatter estimators are well suited to the use of data-adaptive methods for\nestimating their nuisance functions. We establish the rate conditions required\nof the nuisance functions for semiparametric efficiency. We also discuss how\nour framework applies to several estimands that may be of particular interest\nin empirical applications. The proposed estimators are illustrated with a\nsimulation study and an empirical example.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Nov 2020 14:15:33 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 10 Nov 2021 20:50:28 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-11-12"}

This is a complex\nbiogeochemical process in subsurface reservoirs that currently contains strong\nconceptual uncertainty. This means, several modeling approaches describing the\nbiogeochemical process are plausible and modelers face the uncertainty of\nchoosing the most appropriate one. Once observation data becomes available, a\nrigorous Bayesian model selection accompanied by a Bayesian model\njustifiability analysis could be employed to choose the most appropriate model,\ni.e. the one that describes the underlying physical processes best in the light\nof the available data. However, biogeochemical modeling is computationally very\ndemanding because it conceptualizes different phases, biomass dynamics,\ngeochemistry, precipitation and dissolution in porous media. Therefore, the\nBayesian framework cannot be based directly on the full computational models as\nthis would require too many expensive model evaluations. To circumvent this\nproblem, we suggest performing both Bayesian model selection and justifiability\nanalysis after constructing surrogates for the competing biogeochemical models.\nHere, we use the arbitrary polynomial chaos expansion. We account for the\napproximation error in the Bayesian analysis by introducing novel correction\nfactors for the resulting model weights.

To retrieve\nappropriate responses for users, it is necessary to compute the matching\ndegrees between candidate responses and users' queries with historical dialogue\nutterances. As the contexts are usually much longer than responses, it is thus\nnecessary to expand the responses (usually short) with richer information.\nRecent studies on pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) have demonstrated its\neffectiveness in query expansion for search engines, hence we consider\nexpanding response using PRF information. However, existing PRF approaches are\neither based on heuristic rules or require heavy manual labeling, which are not\nsuitable for solving our task.

This\nparticularly concerns the black-box score-based setup, where the attacker has\naccess to top predicted probabilites: the amount of queries went from to\nmillions of to less than a thousand. This paper presents SurFree, a geometrical\napproach that achieves a similar drastic reduction in the amount of queries in\nthe hardest setup: black box decision-based attacks (only the top-1 label is\navailable). We first highlight that the most recent attacks in that setup,\nHSJA, QEBA and GeoDA all perform costly gradient surrogate estimations.

The movement\nwas composed of a 9 m repetitive back-and-forth movement pattern with a pause.\nRegarding the motion condition, the direction and timing of the motion were\nvaried as follows: a) Predictable motion (M_P): the direction of the motion and\nduration of the pause were set to 8 s; b) Motion with unpredicted direction\n(M_dU): the pause duration was fixed as in (P), but the motion direction was\nrandomly determined; c) Motion with unpredicted timing (M_tU): the motion\ndirection was fixed as in (M_P), but the pause duration was randomly selected\nfrom 4 to 12 s. The results obtained using the proposed model demonstrated that\nthe predicted motion sickness incidence for (M_P) was smaller than those for\n(M_dU) and (M_tU). This tendency agrees with the sickness patterns observed in\na previous experimental study in which the human participants were subject to\nmotion conditions similar to those used in our simulations. Moreover, no\nsignificant differences were found in the predicted motion sickness incidences\nat different conditions when the conventional model was used.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Nov 2020 15:29:51 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 14 Jan 2021 09:29:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 15 Jan 2021 11:51:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-18"}

However,\nfew numbers of publications discuss the impacts of external EM-waves on neural\nstimulation and communication through the nervous system. In fact, complex\nbiological neural channels are a main barrier for intact and comprehensive\nanalyses in this area. One of the everpresent challenges in neural\ncommunication responses is dependency of vesicle release probability on the\ninput spiking pattern. In this regard, this study sheds light on consequences\nof changing the frequency of external EM-wave excitation on the post-synaptic\nneuron's spiking rate. It is assumed that the penetration depth of the wave in\nbrain does not cover the postsynaptic neuron. Consequently, we model\nneurotransmission of a bipartite chemical synapse. In addition, the way that\nexternal stimulation affects neurotransmission is examined. Unlike multiple\nfrequency component EM-waves, the monochromatic incident wave does not face\nfrequency shift and distortion in dispersive media. In this manner, a single\nfrequency signal is added as external current in the modified leaky\nintegrated-andfire (LIF) model. The results demonstrate existence of a node\nequilibrium point in the first order dynamical system of LIF model. A fold\nbifurcation (for presupposed LIF model values) occurs when the external\nexcitation frequency is near 200 Hz.

The\nD-Wave 2000Q has been used to implement QA. RBMs are trained on the ISCX data,\nwhich is a benchmark dataset for cybersecurity. For comparison, RBMs are also\ntrained using CD. CD is a commonly used method for RBM training. Our analysis\nof the ISCX data shows that the dataset is imbalanced. We present two different\nschemes to balance the training dataset before feeding it to a classifier. The\nfirst scheme is based on the undersampling of benign instances. The imbalanced\ntraining dataset is divided into five sub-datasets that are trained separately.\nA majority voting is then performed to get the result. Our results show the\nmajority vote increases the classification accuracy up from 90.24% to 95.68%,\nin the case of CD. For the case of QA, the classification accuracy increases\nfrom 74.14% to 80.04%. In the second scheme, a RBM is used to generate\nsynthetic data to balance the training dataset. We show that both QA and\nCD-trained RBM can be used to generate useful synthetic data. Balanced training\ndata is used to evaluate several classifiers. Among the classifiers\ninvestigated, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Neural Network (NN) perform better\nthan other classifiers. They both show an accuracy of 93%. Our results show a\nproof-of-concept that a QA-based RBM can be trained on a 64-bit binary dataset.\nThe illustrative example suggests the possibility to migrate many practical\nclassification problems to QA-based techniques.

FL provides privacy-by-design. It trains a machine learning model\ncollaboratively over several distributed clients (ranging from two to millions)\nsuch as mobile phones, without sharing their raw data with any other\nparticipant. In practical scenarios, all clients do not have sufficient\ncomputing resources (e.g., Internet of Things), the machine learning model has\nmillions of parameters, and its privacy between the server and the clients\nwhile training/testing is a prime concern (e.g., rival parties). In this\nregard, FL is not sufficient, so split learning (SL) is introduced. SL is\nreliable in these scenarios as it splits a model into multiple portions,\ndistributes them among clients and server, and trains/tests their respective\nmodel portions to accomplish the full model training/testing. In SL, the\nparticipants do not share both data and their model portions to any other\nparties, and usually, a smaller network portion is assigned to the clients\nwhere data resides. Recently, a hybrid of FL and SL, called splitfed learning,\nis introduced to elevate the benefits of both FL (faster training/testing time)\nand SL (model split and training). Following the developments from FL to SL,\nand considering the importance of SL, this chapter is designed to provide\nextensive coverage in SL and its variants.

In practice,\nvarious approaches for this concern first make some corrections corresponding\nto potentially noisy-labeled instances, and then update predictive model with\ninformation of the made corrections. However, in specific areas, such as\nmedical histopathology whole slide image analysis (MHWSIA), it is often\ndifficult or even impossible for experts to manually achieve the noisy-free\nground-truth labels which leads to labels with complex noise. This situation\nraises two more difficult problems: 1) the methodology of approaches making\ncorrections corresponding to potentially noisy-labeled instances has\nlimitations due to the complex noise existing in labels; and 2) the appropriate\nevaluation strategy for validation/testing is unclear because of the great\ndifficulty in collecting the noisy-free ground-truth labels.

Applying OSAMTL and LAF to the Helicobacter pylori\n(H. pylori) segmentation task in MHWSIA, we show that OSAMTL is able to enable\nthe machine learning model achieving logically more rational predictions, which\nis beyond various state-of-the-art approaches in handling complex noisy labels.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Nov 2020 09:40:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 18 Aug 2021 06:06:09 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 11 Feb 2022 03:51:16 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-02-14"}

The ability to\nextend the knowledge of a model with new data without forgetting previously\nlearned samples is a fundamental requirement in continual learning.

Thus, the proponents developed the Dynamic Local Area Network (LAN)\nBased Mock Board Examination System that makes the preparation and checking\neasy.\n  Method-The proponents followed the iterative waterfall model to develop the\nsystem efficiently. Some criteria of ISO 25010 were adopted in the evaluation\ninstrument. Simultaneously, evaluators are composed of program chairperson,\nCollege of Computer Studies (CCS) faculty, board program students, and alumni.\n  Results-The result of 4.91 in Functional Suitability, 4.87 in Performance\nEfficiency, 4.91 in Usability, 4.90 in Security, and 4.92 in Maintainability\nshows that the system is fully functional and is usable by any board program.\n  Conclusion The computer-based examination, implemented through LAN, can\nsimplify administering personnel of MinSCAT mock board examination. The\ndevelopment of the \"Dynamic LAN Based Mock Board Examination System\" is a great\nhelp to the MinSCAT and their board program graduates if it is implemented.\n  Recommendations-The system has hidden weaknesses that were only identified in\nactual operation. Thus, further testing is needed, like beta testing, to\nidentify and correct it for better performance.

It is argued that the experiments on Eu have to be repeated to\neither validate or rule out the claim that it is a superconducting element.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 25 Nov 2020 07:33:04 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 22 Feb 2021 02:18:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 25 Aug 2021 17:33:41 GMT"},{"version":"v4","created":"Thu, 9 Dec 2021 17:51:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-10"}

As several vaccines have recently been approved for human use or\nare in different stages of development, governments across the world are\npreparing comprehensive guidelines for vaccine distribution and monitoring. In\nthis early article, we identify challenges in logistics, health outcomes,\nuser-centric matters, and communication associated with disease-related,\nindividual, societal, economic, and privacy consequences. Primary challenges\ninclude difficulty in equitable distribution, vaccine efficacy, duration of\nimmunity, multi-dose adherence, and privacy-focused record-keeping to be HIPAA\ncompliant. While many of these challenges have been previously identified and\naddressed, some have not been acknowledged from a comprehensive view accounting\nfor unprecedented interactions between challenges and specific populations. The\nlogistics of equitable widespread vaccine distribution in disparate populations\nand countries of various economic, racial, and cultural constitutions must be\nthoroughly examined and accounted for. We also describe unique challenges\nregarding the efficacy of vaccines in specialized populations including\nchildren, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals. Furthermore, we\nreport the potential for understudied drug-vaccine interactions as well as the\npossibility that certain vaccine platforms may increase susceptibility to HIV.\nGiven these complicated issues, the importance of privacy-focused, user-centric\nsystems for vaccine education and incentivization along with clear\ncommunication from governments, organizations, and academic institutions is\nimperative. These challenges are by no means insurmountable, but require\ncareful attention to avoid consequences spanning a range of disease-related,\nindividual, societal, economic, and security domains.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 24 Nov 2020 17:16:29 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Feb 2021 07:08:47 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 27 Apr 2022 08:42:01 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-28"}

Although in such controlled environments we can guarantee the absence\nof any other technology sharing the channel on a long-term basis, the\nuncertainty of obtaining channel access through load based equipment (LBE) or\nframe based equipment (FBE) can impede with the latency requirements of URLLC.\nIn FBE, the transmitters can be prioritized to support data with different\nrequirements and have lower energy consumption and latency compared to LBE with\na big contention window size.
