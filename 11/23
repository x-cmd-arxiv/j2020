Acoustic\nrecording units are a promising technology for efficiently monitoring bird\npopulations and communities. We present an integrated modeling framework that\ncombines high-quality but temporally sparse bird point count survey data with\nacoustic recordings. Using simulations, we compare the accuracy and precision\nof abundance estimates using differing amounts of acoustic vocalizations\nobtained from a clustering algorithm, point count data, and a subset of\nmanually validated acoustic vocalizations. We also use our modeling framework\nin a case study to estimate abundance of the Eastern Wood-Pewee (Contopus\nvirens) in Vermont, U.S.A. The simulation study reveals that combining acoustic\nand point count data via an integrated model improves accuracy and precision of\nabundance estimates compared with models informed by either acoustic or point\ncount data alone. Combining acoustic data with only a small number of point\ncount surveys yields estimates of abundance without the need for validating any\nof the identified vocalizations from the acoustic data. Within our case study,\nthe integrated models provided moderate support for a decline of the Eastern\nWood-Pewee in this region. Our integrated modeling approach combines dense\nacoustic data with few point count surveys to deliver reliable estimates of\nspecies abundance without the need for manual identification of acoustic\nvocalizations or a prohibitively expensive large number of repeated point count\nsurveys. Our proposed approach offers an efficient monitoring alternative for\nlarge spatio-temporal regions when point count data are difficult to obtain or\nwhen monitoring is focused on rare species with low detection probability.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Nov 2020 16:02:27 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 6 May 2021 10:37:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-07"}

The growth in the number of smart farms and\npotential cooperation between these farms has given rise to the Cooperative\nSmart Farming (CSF) where different connected farms collaborate with each other\nand share data for their mutual benefit. This data sharing through CSF has\nvarious advantages where individual data from separate farms can be aggregated\nby ML models and be used to produce actionable outputs which then can be\nutilized by all the farms in CSFs. This enables farms to gain better insights\nfor enhancing desired outputs, such as crop yield, managing water resources and\nirrigation schedules, as well as better seed applications. However,\ncomplications may arise in CSF when some of the farms do not transfer\nhigh-quality data and rather rely on other farms to feed ML models.

Here we report on modifying\nthe internal quantum efficiency of a single NV center in a nanodiamond coupled\nto a 1D photonic crystal cavity.

But, most of these multi-view learning\nmethods are built on the assumption that at each instance no view is missing\nand all data points from all views must be perfectly paired. Hence they cannot\nhandle unpaired data but ignore them completely from their learning process.\nHowever, unpaired data can be more abundant in reality than paired ones and\nsimply ignoring all unpaired data incur tremendous waste in resources. In this\npaper, we focus on learning uncorrelated features by semi-paired subspace\nlearning, motivated by many existing works that show great successes of\nlearning uncorrelated features. Specifically, we propose a generalized\nuncorrelated multi-view subspace learning framework, which can naturally\nintegrate many proven learning criteria on the semi-paired data. To showcase\nthe flexibility of the framework, we instantiate five new semi-paired models\nfor both unsupervised and semi-supervised learning. We also design a successive\nalternating approximation (SAA) method to solve the resulting optimization\nproblem and the method can be combined with the powerful Krylov subspace\nprojection technique if needed. Extensive experimental results on multi-view\nfeature extraction and multi-modality classification show that our proposed\nmodels perform competitively to or better than the baselines.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Nov 2020 22:14:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-24"}

The inter-trace variance\ncan be efficiently estimated from observed data and leads to a more efficient\nMCMC-mean estimator. Prior MCMC mean-estimators receive, as input, upper-bounds\non $\\tau_{mix}$ or $\\tau_{rel}$, and often also the stationary variance, and\ntheir performance is highly dependent to the sharpness of these bounds. In\ncontrast, we introduce DynaMITE, which dynamically adjusts the sample size, it\nis less sensitive to the looseness of input upper-bounds on $\\tau_{rel}$, and\nrequires no bound on $v_{\\pi}$.\n  Receiving only an upper-bound ${\\cal T}_{rel}$ on $\\tau_{rel}$, DynaMITE\nestimates the mean of $f$ in $\\tilde{\\cal{O}}\\bigl(\\smash{\\frac{{\\cal T}_{rel}\nR}{\\varepsilon}}+\\frac{\\tau_{rel}\\cdot {\\rm\ntrv}^{(\\tau{{rel}})}}{\\varepsilon^{2}}\\bigr)$ steps, without a priori bounds on\nthe stationary variance $v_{\\pi}$ or the inter-trace variance ${\\rm trv}^{(\\tau\nrel)}$.

The analytical results provide insights and lay the groundwork for the\nfine-grained scheduling with QoS guarantee as presented in Part II.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Nov 2020 23:33:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-24"}

For the networking scenario, fine-grained\nscheduling that attends to each device becomes necessary, given stringent\nquality of service (QoS) requirements and diversified service types, but\nprohibitively complex for a large number of devices. To address this challenge,\nwe propose a scheduling solution in two steps. First, we develop algorithms for\ndevice assignment based on the analytical results from Part I, when parameters\nof the proposed protocol are given. Then, we train a deep neural network for\nassisting in the determination of the protocol parameters. The two-step\napproach ensures the accuracy and granularity necessary for satisfying the QoS\nrequirements and avoids excessive complexity from handling a large number of\ndevices. Integrating the distributed coordination in the protocol design from\nPart I and the centralized scheduling from this part, the proposed MAC protocol\nachieves high performance, demonstrated through extensive simulations. For\nexample, the results show that the proposed MAC can support 1000 devices under\nan aggregated traffic load of 3000 packets per second with a single channel and\nachieve <0.5ms average delay and <1% average collision probability among 50\nhigh priority devices.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Nov 2020 23:33:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-24"}

In\nrecent years, one research focus is to solve the open-set problem by\ndiscriminative deep embedding learning in the field of face recognition (FR)\nand person re-identification (re-ID). Apart from open-set problem, we find that\nimbalanced training data is another main factor causing the performance\ndegradation of FR and re-ID, and data imbalance widely exists in the real\napplications. However, very little research explores why and how data imbalance\ninfluences the performance of FR and re-ID with softmax or its variants. In\nthis work, we deeply investigate data imbalance in the perspective of neural\nnetwork optimisation and feature distribution about softmax.

That kind of network can be represented by a graph.\nRecently, some decentralized methods have been proposed to compute linear\ntransformations by leveraging the notion of graph shift operator, which\ncaptures the local structure of the graph. However, existing approaches have\nsome drawbacks such as considering some special instances of linear\ntransformations, or reducing the family of transformations by assuming that a\nshift matrix is given such that a subset of its eigenvectors spans the subspace\nof interest. In contrast, this paper develops a framework for computing a wide\nclass of linear transformations in a decentralized fashion by relying on the\nnotion of graph shift operator. The main goal of the proposed method is to\ncompute the desired linear transformation in a small number of iterations. To\nthis end, a set of successive graph shift operators is employed, then, a new\noptimization problem is proposed whose goal is to compute the desired\ntransformation as fast as possible. In addition, usually, the topology of the\nnetworks, especially the wireless sensor networks, change randomly because of\nnode failures or random links. In this paper, the effect of edge fluctuations\non the performance of the proposed method is studied. To deal with the negative\neffect of edge fluctuations, an online kernel-based method is proposed which\nenables nodes to estimate the missed values with their at hand information. The\nproposed method can also be employed to sparsify the network graph or reduce\nthe number of local exchanges between nodes, which saves sensors power in the\nwireless sensor networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2020 01:32:05 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-24"}

Recent estimates suggest that they contribute to 33\\% of\nthe heat released at the surface of the Earth, while occupying less than 1\\% of\nthe mantle. This distinctive feature has profound implications for the\nunderlying mantle by impacting its thermal structure and heat transfer.\nHowever, the effects of a continental crust enriched in heat-producing elements\non the underlying mantle have not yet been systematically investigated. Here,\nwe conduct a preliminary investigation by considering a simplified convective\nsystem consisting in a mixed heated fluid where all the internal heating is\nconcentrated in a top layer of thickness $d_{HL}$ (referred to as\n\"heat-blanketed convection\"). We perform 24 numerical simulations in 3D\nCartesian geometry for four specific set-ups and various values of $d_{HL}$.\nOur results suggest that the effects of the heated layer strongly depend on its\nthickness relative to the thickness of the thermal boundary layer\n($\\delta_{TBL}$) in the homogeneous heating case ($d_{HL} = 1.0$). More\nspecifically, for $d_{HL} > \\delta_{TBL}$, the effects induced by the heated\nlayer are quite modest, while, for $d_{HL} < \\delta_{TBL}$, the properties of\nthe convective system are strongly altered as $d_{HL}$ decreases. In\nparticular, the surface heat flux and convective vigour are significantly\nenhanced for very thin heated layers compared to the case $d_{HL} = 1.0$. The\nvertical distribution of heat producing elements may therefore play a key role\non mantle dynamics. For Earth, the presence of continents should however not\naffect significantly the surface heat flux, and thus the Earth's cooling rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2020 01:32:59 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-17"}

The\ninertial microcavitation-based high strain-rate rheometry (IMR) method [Estrada\net al., J. Mech. Phys. Solids, 2018, 112, 291-317] combines laser-induced\ncavitation measurements with a model for the bubble dynamics to measure local\nproperties of polyacrylamide hydrogel under high strain-rates from $10^3$ to\n$10^8$ s$^{-1}$. While promising, laser-induced cavitation involves plasma\nformation and optical breakdown during nucleation, a process that could alter\nlocal material properties before measurements are obtained. In the present\nstudy, we extend the IMR method to another means to generate cavitation, namely\nhigh-amplitude focused ultrasound, and apply the resulting\nacoustic-cavitation-based IMR to characterize the mechanical properties of\nagarose hydrogels. Material properties including viscosity, elastic constants,\nand a stress-free bubble radius are inferred from bubble radius histories in\n$0.3\\%$ and $1\\%$ agarose gels. An ensemble-based data assimilation is used to\nfurther help interpret the obtained estimates. The resulting parameter\ndistributions are consistent with available measurements of agarose gel\nproperties and with expected trends related to gel concentration and high\nstrain-rate loading. Our findings demonstrate the utility of applying IMR and\ndata assimilation methods with single-bubble acoustic cavitation data for\nmeasurement of viscoelastic properties.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2020 02:11:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-24"}

To deal with\ntheir negative effects on downstream applications, data cleaning approaches are\ndesigned to preprocess the dirty data before conducting applications. The idea\nof most data cleaning methods is to identify or correct dirty data, referring\nto the values of their neighbors which share the same information.\nUnfortunately, owing to data sparsity and heterogeneity, the number of\nneighbors based on equality relationship is rather limited, especially in the\npresence of data values with variances. To tackle this problem, distance-based\ndata cleaning approaches propose to consider similarity neighbors based on\nvalue distance. By tolerance of small variants, the enriched similarity\nneighbors can be identified and used for data cleaning tasks. At the same time,\ndistance relationship between tuples is also helpful to guide the data\ncleaning, which contains more information and includes the equality\nrelationship. Therefore, distance-based technology plays an important role in\nthe data cleaning area, and we also have reason to believe that distance-based\ndata cleaning technology will attract more attention in data preprocessing\nresearch in the future. Hence this survey provides a classification of four\nmain data cleaning tasks, i.e., rule profiling, error detection, data repair\nand data imputation, and comprehensively reviews the state of the art for each\nclass.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2020 02:26:25 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-24"}

However, the photogrammetric meshes also\nsuffer from severe texture problems, especially on the road areas due to\nocclusion. This paper proposes a structure-aware completion approach to improve\nthe quality of meshes by removing undesired vehicles on the road seamlessly.\nSpecifically, the discontinuous texture atlas is first integrated to a\ncontinuous screen space through rendering by the graphics pipeline; the\nrendering also records necessary mapping for deintegration to the original\ntexture atlas after editing. Vehicle regions are masked by a standard object\ndetection approach, e.g. Faster RCNN. Then, the masked regions are completed\nguided by the linear structures and regularities in the road region, which is\nimplemented based on Patch Match. Finally, the completed rendered image is\ndeintegrated to the original texture atlas and the triangles for the vehicles\nare also flattened for improved meshes. Experimental evaluations and analyses\nare conducted against three datasets, which are captured with different sensors\nand ground sample distances. The results reveal that the proposed method can\nquite realistic meshes after removing the vehicles. The structure-aware\ncompletion approach for road regions outperforms popular image completion\nmethods and ablation study further confirms the effectiveness of the linear\nguidance.

One of the important aspects of our analysis\nconsists in utilizing the operators and the vacuum of interacting theory in\nconstructing the states, without invoking asymptotic particles. Focusing on a\ncoherent state describing a spatially homogeneous field configuration, it is\ndemonstrated that both adopted methods successfully account for nonlinear\nclassical dynamics, giving distinguishable quantum effects. In particular,\naccording to the time-expansion analysis the initial field-acceleration, with\nwhich the field departs from its initial expectation value, is governed by the\ntree-level potential with renormalized mass and bare coupling constant. The\ninteraction-picture computation, instead, can be manipulated to give the\nnonlinear dynamics, determined in terms of renormalized coupling and mass.\nHowever, it results in a logarithmic initial-time singularity in the\nfield-acceleration, reminiscent of the similar behaviour encountered within\nsemi-classical formalism, for certain choices of the initial state for\nfluctuations.

The mobility\nminimum is deep at T=80K and partially smoothed at T=300K. We explain this\nminimum as follows. As the LNC fraction f_LNC starts growing from zero, the few\nLNCs act as traps for the electrons traversing the BNS because their relevant\nenergy level is lower. Therefore, increasing the f_LNC concentration of these\ntraps decreases the mobility. As increasing f_LNC reaches the percolation\nthreshold f_LNC=f_p, the LNCs form sample-spanning networks that enable\nelectrons to traverse the entire BNS via these percolating LNC networks.\nTransport through the growing percolating LNC networks drives the rapid growth\nof the mobility as f_LNC grows past f_p. Therefore, the electron mobility\nexhibits a pronounced minimum as a function of f_LNC, centered at f_LNC=f_p.\nThe position of the mobility minimum shifts to larger LNC fractions as the\nelectron density increases. We have studied the trends of this mobility minimum\nwith temperature, electron density, charging energy, ligand length, and\ndisorder. We account for the trends by a \"renormalized trap model\", in which\ncapturing an electron renormalizes a deep LNC trap into a shallow trap or a\nkinetic obstacle, depending on the charging energy. We verified this physical\npicture by constructing and analyzing heat maps of the mobile electrons in the\nBNS.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2020 07:05:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-12"}

This coevolution reflects structural\nand functional constraints acting on protein sequences during evolution. The\nmost conservative choice to describe the coevolution signal is to include all\npossible two-site couplings into the PM.

Provided that the\nparameters of the atom-field interaction are optimal, we show that the momentum\ndiffusion coefficient is proportional to the intensity of the laser radiation.\nWe used the Monte Carlo wave-function method for the numerical simulation of\nthe atomic motion.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2020 10:22:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-14"}

In addition to their low power requirements, cost effectiveness and\nefficient interconnects, neuromorphic NWNs are also fault-tolerant and\nself-healing.

As the search space of registration is\nusually non-convex, the optimization algorithm, which aims to search the best\ntransformation parameters, is a challenging step. Conventional optimization\nalgorithms can hardly reconcile the contradiction of simultaneous rapid\nconvergence and the global optimization. In this paper, a novel learning-based\noptimization algorithm named Image Registration Optimizer Network (IRON) is\nproposed, which can predict the global optimum after single iteration. The IRON\nis trained by a 3D tensor (9x9x9), which consists of similar metric values. The\nelements of the 3D tensor correspond to the 9x9x9 neighbors of the initial\nparameters in the search space. Then, the tensor's label is a vector that\npoints to the global optimal parameters from the initial parameters. Because of\nthe special architecture, the IRON could predict the global optimum directly\nfor any initialization. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed\nalgorithm performs better than other classical optimization algorithms as it\nhas higher accuracy, lower root of mean square error (RMSE), and more\nefficiency.

We use the sensor to\nobserve system states and transmit its local state estimates to the remote\ncenter. Meanwhile, the attacker injects a jamming signal to destroy the packet\naccepted by the remote center and causes the performance degradation. Most of\nthe existing works are built on a time-invariant channel state information\n(CSI) model in which the channel fading is stationary. However, the wireless\ncommunication channels are more prone to dynamic changes. To capture this\ntime-variant property in the channel quality of the real-world networks, we\nstudy the fading channel network whose channel model is characterized by a\ngeneralized finite-state Markov chain.

Wu and Yau's theorem states that if a smooth projective manifolds\nadmits a K\\\"ahler metric with negative holomorphic sectional curvature, then it\nalso admits a possibly different K\\\"ahler metric whose Ricci curvature is\nnegative. It can be therefore seen as a weak confirmation of Kobayashi's\nconjecture above, since it gives the same conclusion but with the stronger\nhypothesis about the holomorphic sectional curvature. Beside a fully detailed\npresentation of the proof of this theorem, we also provide some basic\nbackground on complex differential geometry as well as several (positive or\nnegative) results about the theme of curvature and hyperbolicity. Some natural\nopen questions are also discussed. The proof of the Wu-Yau theorem presented\nhere follows quite closely the original main key ideas by Wu and Yau, but the\nconclusion is somehow simplified using the pluripotential approach of the\nauthor and S. Trapani.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2020 13:15:50 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 15 Dec 2020 11:27:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-16"}

Arguably, the concept of participative experiences is already so\ndeeply ingrained in our culture that we may not even think about it as\nparticipation. Museum visitors engage in a number of activities, of which\nobserving the exhibits is only one part. Since most visitors come to the museum\ntogether with someone else, they spend time and attention on the people they\ncame with, and often the needs of the group are given priority over individual\npreferences. How can museums tap into these activities - and make themselves\nrelevant to visitors? In this chapter we will try to approach this\nconstructively, as a design opportunity. Could it be productive for the museum\nto consider itself not only as a disseminator of knowledge, but also as the\nfacilitator of participative activities between visitors?\n  In what follows, we will outline a range of practical design projects that\nserve as examples of this approach. These projects were part of the European\nUnion funded Horizon2020 project GIFT, a cross-disciplinary collaboration\nbetween researchers, artists, designers and many international museums and\nheritage organisations, exploring the concept of interpersonal museum\nexperiences (see https://gifting.digital/). What the projects have in common is\nthat they build on visitors co-creating and sharing their own narratives in the\nmuseum context.

It is rather well established that they are unstable\nwith respect to small perturbations of the NLS equation.

The\nstructure factor tail in the canted regime follows the {\\it Porod law}:\n$S(k,t)\\sim k^{-4}$, implying that the coarsening dynamics is due to the\nannihilation of interfacial defects. This is unexpected, as the GLL model is\ncharacterised by a continuous order parameter. The uniform regime on the other\nhand, exhibits the expected {\\it generalized Porod decay}: $S(k,t)\\sim k^{-5}$,\ncharacteristic of scattering from {\\it string defects}. Finally, the domain\ngrowth obeys the {\\it Lifshitz-Allen-Cahn law}: $L(t)\\sim t^{1/2}$ for all\nvalues of $\\lambda$. Our results for the novel {\\it canted} regime are relevant\nfor a large class of systems with orientational ordering, e.g. active matter,\nmembranes, LC elastomers, etc. We hope that our work triggers-off stimulating\ninvestigations in them.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2020 14:00:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-24"}

In this work, we theoretically investigate the response of such an\nauto-thermophoretic particle near a planar wall which is held isothermal. We\nderive an exact solution of the energy equation and employ the Reynolds\nreciprocal theorem to obtain the translational and rotational swimming\nvelocities in the creeping flow limit. Subsequently, we analyse the\ntrajectories of the micromotor for different thermo-physical and\nconfigurational parameters. Results show that the micromotor trajectories can\nbe switched either from wall-bound sliding or stationary state to escape from\nthe near-wall zone by suitably choosing the particle and the surrounding fluid\npair having selective thermal conductivity contrasts. Further, we discuss the\ndependency of this swimming-state transition on the launching orientation and\nthe coverage of the metallic cap. Our results reveal that the scenario\naddressed here holds several exclusive distinguishing features from the\notherwise extensively studied self-diffusiophoresis phenomenon near an inert\nwall, despite obvious analogies in the respective constitutive laws relating\nthe fluxes with the gradients of the concerned forcing parameters. The most\ncontrasting locomotion behaviour here turns out to be the ability of a\nself-thermophoretic micromotor to migrate towards the wall with large heated\ncap even if it is initially directed away from the wall. Besides, during the\nstationary state of swimming, the cold portion on the micromotor surface faces\naway from the wall, under all conditions. Such unique aspects of locomotion\nhold the potential of being harnessed in practice towards achieving intricate\ncontrol over autonomous motion of microparticles in thermally-regulated fluidic\nenvironments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2020 14:04:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-01"}

As such, the\nprediction of the components can theoretically be carried out with notably\nhigher precision.

In this equilibrium,\ndaily cases stabilize around ten new infections per million people or less.\nHowever, stability is endangered if restrictions are relaxed or case numbers\ngrow too high.

Since it requires a fully quantum mechanical\ndescription of the system, $\\textit{ab-initio}$ molecular dynamics is the ideal\ncandidate to shed light on these processes. However, its scope is limited by a\nhigh computational cost. A popular alternative is to perform molecular dynamics\nsimulations powered by machine learning potentials, trained on an extensive set\nof quantum mechanical calculations. Doing so reliably for reactive processes is\ndifficult because it requires including very many intermediate and transition\nstate configurations.

TOI-519 is a valuable addition into this\ngroup of unlikely systems, and adds towards our understanding of the boundaries\nof planet formation.\n  Aims: We set out to determine the nature of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey\nSatellite (TESS ) object of interest TOI-519 b.\n  Methods: Our analysis uses a SPOC-pipeline TESS light curve from Sector 7,\nmulticolour transit photometry observed with MuSCAT2 and MuSCAT, and transit\nphotometry observed with the LCOGT telescopes.

This realization brought\nback the study of linear models for regression, including ordinary least\nsquares (OLS), which, like deep learning, shows a \"double-descent\" behavior:\n(1) The risk (expected out-of-sample prediction error) can grow arbitrarily\nwhen the number of parameters $p$ approaches the number of samples $n$, and (2)\nthe risk decreases with $p$ for $p>n$, sometimes achieving a lower value than\nthe lowest risk for $p<n$. The divergence of the risk for OLS can be avoided\nwith regularization. In this work, we show that for some data models it can\nalso be avoided with a PCA-based dimensionality reduction (PCA-OLS, also known\nas principal component regression). We provide non-asymptotic bounds for the\nrisk of PCA-OLS by considering the alignments of the population and empirical\nprincipal components. We show that dimensionality reduction improves robustness\nwhile OLS is arbitrarily susceptible to adversarial attacks, particularly in\nthe overparameterized regime. We compare PCA-OLS theoretically and empirically\nwith a wide range of projection-based methods, including random projections,\npartial least squares (PLS), and certain classes of linear two-layer neural\nnetworks. These comparisons are made for different data generation models to\nassess the sensitivity to signal-to-noise and the alignment of regression\ncoefficients with the features. We find that methods in which the projection\ndepends on the training data can outperform methods where the projections are\nchosen independently of the training data, even those with oracle knowledge of\npopulation quantities, another seemingly paradoxical phenomenon that has been\nidentified previously.

This paper proposes a methodology based on Transformer\nNeural Networks to classify the activities of a resident within an ambient\nsensor based environment. We also propose a methodology to pre-train\nTransformers in a self-supervised manner, as a hybrid autoencoder-classifier\nmodel instead of using contrastive loss. The social impact of the research is\nconsidered with wider benefits of the approach and next steps for identifying\ntransitions in human behaviour. In recent years there has been an increasing\ndrive for integrating sensor based technologies within care facilities for data\ncollection. This allows for employing machine learning for many aspects\nincluding activity recognition and anomaly detection. Due to the sensitivity of\nhealthcare environments, some methods of data collection used in current\nresearch are considered to be intrusive within the senior care industry,\nincluding cameras for image based activity recognition, and wearables for\nactivity tracking, but recent studies have shown that using these methods\ncommonly result in poor data quality due to the lack of resident interest in\nparticipating in data gathering. This has led to a focus on ambient sensors,\nsuch as binary PIR motion, connected domestic appliances, and electricity and\nwater metering. By having consistency in ambient data collection, the quality\nof data is considerably more reliable, presenting the opportunity to perform\nclassification with enhanced accuracy.

Electrostatic gating is\nachieved by a metal-grating used as a gate electrode, with an HfO2/AlOx gate\ndielectric on top. This is patterned on a polyimide layer, which acts as a\nquarter wave resonance cavity, coupled with an Au reflector underneath. We get\n90% modulation depth of the intensity, combined with a 20 kHz electrical\nbandwidth in the 1.9 _ 2.7 THz range. We then integrate our modulator with a\nmultimode THz QCL. By adjusting the modulator operational bandwidth, we\ndemonstrate that the graphene modulator can partially compensates the QCL\ncavity dispersion, resulting in an integrated laser behaving as a stable\nfrequency comb over 35% of the laser operational range, with 98 equidistant\noptical modes and with a spectral coverage of ~ 1.2 THz. This has significant\npotential for frontier applications in the terahertz, as tunable\ntransformation-optics devices, active photonic components, adaptive and quantum\noptics, and as a metrological tool for spectroscopy at THz frequencies.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 22 Nov 2020 17:29:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-08"}

In the field of molecular property prediction, the emphasis\nis now put on designing new model architectures, and the importance of atom\nfeaturisation is oftentimes belittled. When contrasting two graph neural\nnetworks, the use of different atom features possibly leads to the incorrect\nattribution of the results to the network architecture. To provide a better\nunderstanding of this issue, we compare multiple atom representations for graph\nmodels and evaluate them on the prediction of free energy, solubility, and\nmetabolic stability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\nmethodological study that focuses on the relevance of atom representation to\nthe predictive performance of graph neural networks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2020 15:01:44 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 12 Feb 2021 09:08:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-15"}

Nevertheless, the effect of the word embedding models on the neural\nnetwork's performance has not been appropriately examined in the literature. In\nour study, through different detection tasks, 2-class, 3-class, and 6-class\nclassification, we investigate the impact of both word embedding models and\nneural network architectures on the predictive accuracy. Our focus is on the\nArabic language. We first train several word embedding models on a large-scale\nunlabelled Arabic text corpus. Next, based on a dataset of Arabic hate and\noffensive speech, for each detection task, we train several neural network\nclassifiers using the pre-trained word embedding models. This task yields a\nlarge number of various learned models, which allows conducting an exhaustive\ncomparison. The empirical analysis demonstrates, on the one hand, the\nsuperiority of the skip-gram models and, on the other hand, the superiority of\nthe CNN network across the three detection tasks.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 23 Nov 2020 02:43:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-15"}
