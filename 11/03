H2CO and CS\noriginate from a disk ring at the edge of the 1.3mm dust continuum, with CS\nprobing an outer disk region with respect to H2CO (peaking at ~70 and ~60 au,\nrespectively). CN originates from an outermost disk/envelope region peaking at\n~80 au. H2CO is dominated by disk emission, while CS probes also two streams of\nmaterial possibly accreting onto the disk with a peak of emission where the\nstream connects to the disk. The ring- and disk-height- averaged column\ndensities are ~2.4-8.6e13 cm-2 (H2CO), ~1.7-2.5e13 cm-2 (CS), and ~1.9-4.7e13\ncm-2 (CN). Unsharp masking reveals a ring of enhanced dust emission at ~40 au,\ni.e. just outside the CO snowline (~30 au). CS and H2CO emissions are\nco-spatial suggesting that they are chemically linked. The observed rings of\nmolecular emission at the edge of the 1.3mm continuum may be due to dust\nopacity effects and/or continnum over-subtraction in the inner disk; as well as\nto increased UV penetration and/or temperature inversion at the edge of the\nmm-dust which would cause an enhanced gas-phase formation and desorption of\nthese molecules. Moreover, H2CO and CS originate from outside the ring of\nenhanced dust emission, which also coincides with a change of the linear\npolarization at 0.87mm.

We\nfit semi-analytic functions for the three stellar torque contributions,\nallowing for the prediction of the net stellar torque for our parameter regime,\nand the possibility of investigating spin-evolution using 1D stellar evolution\ncodes. The presence of an accretion disk appears to increase the efficiency of\nstellar torques compared to isolated stars, for cases with outflow rates much\nsmaller than accretion rates, because the star-disk interaction opens more of\nthe stellar magnetic flux compared to that from isolated stars. In our\nparameter regime, a stellar wind with a mass loss rate of $\\approx 1 \\%$ of the\nmass accretion rate is capable of extracting $\\lesssim 50 \\%$ of the accreting\nangular momentum. These simulations suggest that achieving spin-equilibrium in\na representative T Tauri case within our parameter regime, e.g., BP Tau, would\nrequire a wind mass loss rate of $\\approx 25\\%$ of the mass accretion rate.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Nov 2020 16:18:15 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-06"}

Several recent works have shown the synthesis of highly\nphoto-realistic videos of talking faces, but they either require a source video\nto drive the target face or only generate videos with a fixed head pose. This\nlack of facial movement is because most of these works focus on the lip\nmovement in sync with the audio while assuming the remaining facial keypoints'\nfixed nature. To address this, a unique audio-keypoint dataset of over 150,000\nvideos at 224p and 25fps is introduced that relates the facial keypoint\nmovement for the given audio. This dataset is then further used to train the\nmodel, Audio2Keypoint, a novel approach for synthesizing facial keypoint\nmovement to go with the audio. Given a single image of the target person and an\naudio sequence (in any language), Audio2Keypoint generates a plausible keypoint\nmovement sequence in sync with the input audio, conditioned on the input image\nto preserve the target person's facial characteristics.

We found an inherent and intriguing connection between the released\nenergy in an earthquake and electrochemical potential induced in an ultra-thin\nmetal oxide electrode immersed in an aqueous pH solution, which leads us to\nunderstand the origin of the energy accumulation process in an earthquake. A\nhuge electrochemical potential is accumulated from numerous electrochemical\ncells formed in a unique layer structure of hydrated clay minerals\n(predominantly smectite), which resulted in a lightning-like discharge in the\nlithosphere (hypocenter).

The\npresence of electrical voltage in the hypocenter directly supports the seismic\nelectric signal (SES), further strengthening the VAN method of earthquake\nprediction.

The states emergence is explained through a fluid-solid Floquet\nstability analysis of the non-propulsive symmetric base solution. Unlike a\npurely-hydrodynamic analysis, our analysis accurately determine the locomotion\nstates onset. An unstable synchronous mode is found when the unidirectional\npropulsive solution is observed.

We first use a variational quantum\neigensolver to find the ground state of a Hamiltonian in presence of noise, and\nadopt two quality measures in addition to the energy, namely fidelity and\nconcurrence. We then extend the task to the one of constructing, with a layered\nquantum circuit ansatz, a set of general random target states. We determine the\noptimal circuit depth for different types and levels of noise, and observe that\nthe variational algorithms mitigate the effects of noise by adapting the\noptimised parameters. We find that the inclusion of redundant parameterised\ngates makes the quantum circuits more resilient to noise. For such\noverparameterised circuits different sets of parameters can result in the same\nfinal state in the noiseless case, which we denote as parameter degeneracy.\nNumerically, we show that this degeneracy can be lifted in the presence of\nnoise, with some states being significantly more resilient to noise than\nothers.

The history of optical photometry data of\nthis quasar from the Catalina Real-time Transient Survey and All Sky Automated\nSurvey for Super Novae (ASAS-SN), mid-infrared photometry data from the WISE\nsatellite, and the broad emission line (BEL) flux obtained by spectroscopy of\nSloan Digital Sky Survey shows their significant increases between 2003 and\n2015. Investigating its CFHT photometric observations in 1983 and the USNO-B\ncatalog, which contains data in 1975 and 1969, we found that the source was 4\nmag fainter before than the peak of the recent ASAS-SN photometry. From the\nhistory of these data, we identified J1258 as a new Changing-State Quasar (CSQ;\nor Changing-Look Quasar). We also performed follow-up spectroscopic\nobservations in December 2018 and May 2019, using the 2-meter telescope in\nNishi-Harima Astronomical Observatory. The results show that the continuum flux\nand the BEL flux decreased to about 50 % of its peak. This indicates that J1258\nis causing two changing-states for the BEL flux and continuum flux. We argue\nthat J1258's variability, especially its brightening event, can be explained by\nthe propagation of the heating front and the accretion disk state transitions\nbased on the timescale and Eddington ratio variations. The estimated mass of\nthe black hole of J1258 is about an order of magnitude larger than the CSQs\nfound so far. Since both the changing timescale and the size of the accretion\ndisk depend on the black hole mass, the J1258 brightening event can be\ninterpreted as a scaled version of the variability in other CSQs. This suggests\nthat samples of distant quasars with larger black hole masses may contain\nobjects with longer and severer variations.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Nov 2020 17:04:24 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2020 14:31:11 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Fri, 29 Jul 2022 04:39:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-08-01"}

In this work, we\npresent AudioScope, a novel audio-visual sound separation framework that can be\ntrained without supervision to isolate on-screen sound sources from real\nin-the-wild videos. Prior audio-visual separation work assumed artificial\nlimitations on the domain of sound classes (e.g., to speech or music),\nconstrained the number of sources, and required strong sound separation or\nvisual segmentation labels. AudioScope overcomes these limitations, operating\non an open domain of sounds, with variable numbers of sources, and without\nlabels or prior visual segmentation. The training procedure for AudioScope uses\nmixture invariant training (MixIT) to separate synthetic mixtures of mixtures\n(MoMs) into individual sources, where noisy labels for mixtures are provided by\nan unsupervised audio-visual coincidence model. Using the noisy labels, along\nwith attention between video and audio features, AudioScope learns to identify\naudio-visual similarity and to suppress off-screen sounds.

MESMOC+ works by minimizing the entropy\nof the solution of the optimization problem in function space, i.e., the Pareto\nfrontier, to guide the search for the optimum. The cost of MESMOC+ is linear in\nthe number of objectives and constraints. Furthermore, it is often\nsignificantly smaller than the cost of alternative methods based on minimizing\nthe entropy of the Pareto set.

For the problem of\nestimating the energy of an 8-qubit Ising model system, vnCDR improves the\nabsolute energy error by a factor of 33 over the unmitigated results and by\nfactors 20 and 1.8 over ZNE and CDR, respectively. For the problem of\ncorrecting observables from random quantum circuits with 64 qubits, vnCDR\nimproves the error by factors of 2.7 and 1.5 over ZNE and CDR, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Nov 2020 17:56:02 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 2 Aug 2021 21:25:06 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-04"}

In this paper, we propose solutions to both these issues. To\nmitigate the challenge of modelling a slow-varying signal, we learn to\ndisentangle prosodic information using a word level representation.

The proposal stems from\nthe assumption (which we justify on physical grounds) that grains in granular\nmatter move freely in an {\\it effective} curved Riemannian space. The\ntermination of their trajectories at the onset of jamming is obtained from the\nfocussing of a converging congruence of geodesics in such a space, as a\nsolution of the Raychaudhuri equation for such congruences. This may happen\nirrespective of whether or not the curvature is sourced by external stresses\n(via an effective Einstein equation), although the properties of the resultant\njammed state solution do differ in the two cases. A definite prediction of this\ngeometrical approach is the negative role played by those trajectories which\ntwist about each other, in reaching the jammed state. The local symmetries of\ngranular interaction, translational and rotational invariance (corresponding to\n`force balance' and `torque balance' in standard force-based approaches to\njamming) are inherent in the effective general relativity framework.

Here we\nevaluate the near- and long-term prospects of multi-messenger cosmology in the\nera of future GW observatories: Advanced LIGO Plus (A+, 2025), Voyager-like\ndetectors (2030s), and Cosmic Explorer-like detectors (CE, 2035 and beyond). We\nshow that the BNS horizon distance of $\\approx 700$ Mpc for A+ is well-matched\nto the sensitivity of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory (VRO) for kilonova\ndetections. We find that one year of joint A+ and VRO observations will\nconstrain the value of $H_0$ to percent-level precision, given a small\ninvestment of VRO time dedicated to target-of-opportunity GW follow-up. In the\nVoyager era, the BNS-kilonova observations begin to constrain $\\Omega_m$ with\nan investment of a few percent of VRO time. With the larger BNS horizon\ndistance in the Cosmic Explorer era, on-axis short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) and\ntheir afterglows (though accompanying only some of the GW-detected mergers)\nsupplant kilonovae as the most promising counterparts for redshift\nidentification. We show that five years of joint observations with Cosmic\nExplorer-like facilities and a next-generation gamma-ray satellite with\nlocalization capabilities similar to that presently possible with Swift could\nconstrain both $\\Omega_m$ and $w_0$ to $15-20\\%$. We therefore advocate for a\nrobust target-of-opportunity (ToO) program with VRO, and a wide-field gamma-ray\nsatellite with improved sensitivity in the 2030s, to enable standard siren\ncosmology with next-generation gravitational wave facilities.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Nov 2020 18:57:10 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 4 Nov 2020 17:28:39 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Wed, 13 Jan 2021 12:07:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-11"}

Having an estimation of those parts of a software system that most\nlikely contain bugs may help focus testing efforts, reduce costs, and improve\nproduct quality. Many prediction models and approaches have been introduced\nduring the past decades that try to forecast bugged code elements based on\nstatic source code metrics, change and history metrics, or both. However, there\nis still no universal best solution to this problem, as most suitable features\nand models vary from dataset to dataset and depend on the context in which we\nuse them. Therefore, novel approaches and further studies on this topic are\nhighly necessary. In this paper, we employ a chemometric approach - Partial\nLeast Squares with Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) - for predicting bug prone\nClasses in Java programs using static source code metrics. To our best\nknowledge, PLS-DA has never been used before as a statistical approach in the\nsoftware maintenance domain for predicting software errors. In addition, we\nhave used rigorous statistical treatments including bootstrap resampling and\nrandomization (permutation) test, and evaluation for representing the software\nengineering results. We show that our PLS-DA based prediction model achieves\nsuperior performances compared to the state-of-the-art approaches (i.e.\nF-measure of 0.44-0.47 at 90% confidence level) when no data re-sampling\napplied and comparable to others when applying up-sampling on the largest open\nbug dataset, while training the model is significantly faster, thus finding\noptimal parameters is much easier. In terms of completeness, which measures the\namount of bugs contained in the Java Classes predicted to be defective, PLS-DA\noutperforms every other algorithm: it found 69.3% and 79.4% of the total bugs\nwith no re-sampling and up-sampling, respectively.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Nov 2020 18:58:17 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-03"}

To resolve this mismatch, we propose a new kind\nof middlebox, called Bundler. Bundler uses a novel inner control loop between a\nsendbox (in the sender's site) and a receivebox (in the receiver's site) to\ndetermine the aggregate rate for the bundle, leaving the end-to-end connections\nand their control loops intact.

The\naveraged bipartite entanglement entropy of such states admits a volume law and\nupon increasing the subregion size follows the Page curve. In this paper, we\ngeneralize this setup to random mixed states by coupling the system to a bath\nand use the partial transpose to study their entanglement properties. We\ndevelop a diagrammatic method to incorporate partial transpose within random\nmatrix theory and formulate a perturbation theory in $1/L$, the inverse of the\nHilbert space dimension. We compute several quantities including the spectral\ndensity of partial transpose (or entanglement negativity spectrum), two-point\ncorrelator of eigenvalues, and the logarithmic negativity. As long as the bath\nis smaller than the system, we find that upon sweeping the subregion size, the\nlogarithmic negativity shows an initial increase and a final decrease similar\nto the Page curve, while it admits a plateau in the intermediate regime where\nthe logarithmic negativity only depends on the size of the system and of the\nbath but not on how the system is partitioned. This intermediate phase has no\nanalog in random pure states, and is separated from the two other regimes by a\ncritical point. We further show that when the bath is larger than the system by\nat least two extra qubits the logarithmic negativity is identically zero which\nimplies that there is no distillable entanglement. Using the diagrammatic\napproach, we provide a simple derivation of the semi-circle law of the\nentanglement negativity spectrum in the latter two regimes.

We detect 111 GMCs that give a\nsimilar mass spectrum as those in the Milky Way and other nearby galaxies (a\ntruncated power law with slope of -1.76+/-0.13). We also study Larson's laws\nover the available dynamic range of GMC properties (~2 dex in mass and ~1 dex\nin size): GMCs follow the size-mass relation of the Milky Way, but their\nvelocity dispersion is higher such that the size-linewidth and virial relations\nappear super-linear, deviating from the canonical values. The global\nmolecular-to-atomic gas ratio is very high (~1) while the CO(2-1)/CO(1-0) ratio\nis quite low (~0.5), and both quantities vary from north to south. Star\nformation is predominantly taking place in the south of the TDG, where we\nobserve projected offsets between GMCs and young stellar clusters ranging from\n~50pc to ~200pc; the largest offsets correspond to the oldest knots, as seen in\nother galaxies. In the quiescent north, we find more molecular clouds and a\nhigher molecular-to-atomic gas ratio (~1.5); atomic and diffuse molecular gas\nalso have a higher velocity dispersion there. Overall, the organisation of the\nmolecular ISM in this TDG is quite different from other types of galaxies on\nlarge scales, but the properties of GMCs seem fairly similar, pointing to near\nuniversality of the star-formation process on small scales.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Nov 2020 20:09:39 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-27"}

A major challenge of contemporary RL research is to\ndiscover how to learn with less data. Previous work has shown that domain\ninformation can be successfully used to shape the reward; by adding additional\nreward information, the agent can learn with much less data. Furthermore, if\nthe reward is constructed from a potential function, the optimal policy is\nguaranteed to be unaltered.

Although the transport properties (e.g. mobility) at low\nelectric field have been widely studied, there are limited studies on\nhigh-field properties, which are important for many applications. Particularly,\nthere is lack of understanding of the physical origins underlying the property\ndifferences across different MX2. Here by combining first-principles\ncalculations with Monte Carlo simulations, we study the high-field electron\ntransport in defects-free unstrained and tensilely strained MX2 (M=Mo, W and\nX=S, Se). We find that WS2 has the highest peak velocity (due to its smallest\neffective mass) that can be reached at the lowest electric field (owing to its\nhighest mobility). Strain can increase the peak velocity by increasing the\nscattering energy. After reaching the peak velocity, most MX2 demonstrates\nnegative differential mobility (NDM). WS2 shows the largest NDM among\nunstrained MX2 due to the strongest effect of electron transfer from the\nlow-energy small-mass valley to the high-energy large-mass valley. The tensile\nstrain increases the valley separation, which on one hand suppresses the\nelectron transfer in WS2, on the other hand allows the electrons to access the\nnon-parabolic band region of the low-energy valley. The latter effect leads to\nan NDM for electrons in the low-energy valley, which can significantly increase\nthe overall NDM at moderate strain. The valley-separation induced NDM in the\nlow-energy valley is found to be a general phenomenon. Our work unveils the\nphysical factors underlying the differences in high-field transport properties\nof different MX2, and also identifies the most promising candidate as well as\neffective approach for further improvement.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Nov 2020 20:41:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-04"}

There have been many breakthroughs in\nsupervised approaches to solving RPM in recent years. However, this process\nrequires external assistance, and thus it cannot be claimed that machines have\nachieved reasoning ability comparable to humans. Namely, humans can solve RPM\nproblems without supervision or prior experience once the RPM rule that\nrelations can only exist row/column-wise is properly introduced. In this paper,\nwe introduce a pairwise relations discriminator (PRD), a technique to develop\nunsupervised models with sufficient reasoning abilities to tackle an RPM\nproblem. PRD reframes the RPM problem into a relation comparison task, which we\ncan solve without requiring the labelling of the RPM problem.

It is of interest to consider whether such quantum states of\nlight could be generated by exploiting interactions with free electrons, going\nbeyond their already ubiquitous use in generating classical light. This\nquestion is motivated by developments in electron microscopy, which present a\nnew platform for manipulating photons through their interaction with quantum\nfree electrons. Here, we explore the shaping of photon statistics using the\nquantum interactions of free electrons with photons in optical cavities. We\nfind a variety of quantum states of light that can be generated by a judicious\nchoice of the input light and electron states. For example, we show how shaping\nan electron into an energy comb can provide an implementation of a photon\ndisplacement operation, allowing, for instance, the generation of displaced\nFock and displaced squeezed states. We also show how one can generate a desired\nFock state by repeated interactions of electrons with a cavity, followed by\nmeasurements. We develop the underlying theory of the interaction of both a\nsingle and many consecutive electrons with a common cavity mode. Looking\nforward, by exploiting the degrees of freedom of arbitrary electron-photon\nquantum states, we may achieve complete control over the statistics and\ncorrelations of output photonic states, leading to the generation of novel\nquantum states of light.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Nov 2020 20:59:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-12-07"}

In\nthe absence of disorder, it has long been expected that as the electron density\nis lowered, the exchange energy gained by aligning the electron spins should\nexceed the enhancement in the kinetic (Fermi) energy, leading to a (Bloch)\nferromagnetic transition. At even lower densities, another transition to a\n(Wigner) solid, an ordered array of electrons, should occur. Experimental\naccess to these regimes, however, has been limited because of the absence of a\nmaterial platform that supports an electron system with very high-quality (low\ndisorder) and low density simultaneously. Here we explore the ground states of\ninteracting electrons in an exceptionally-clean, two-dimensional electron\nsystem confined to a modulation-doped AlAs quantum well. The large electron\neffective mass in this system allows us to reach very large values of the\ninteraction parameter $r_s$, defined as the ratio of the Coulomb to Fermi\nenergies. As we lower the electron density via gate bias, we find a sequence of\nphases, qualitatively consistent with the above scenario: a paramagnetic phase\nat large densities, a spontaneous transition to a ferromagnetic state when\n$r_s$ surpasses 35, and then a phase with strongly non-linear current-voltage\ncharacteristics, suggestive of a pinned Wigner solid, when $r_s$ exceeds\n$\\simeq 38$. However, our sample makes a transition to an insulating state at\n$r_s\\simeq 27$, preceding the onset of the spontaneous ferromagnetism, implying\nthat, besides interaction, the role of disorder must also be taken into account\nin understanding the different phases of a realistic dilute electron system.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Nov 2020 21:51:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-07"}

A substrate withdrawn from a liquid bath entrains a coating\nwhose thickness depends on the withdrawal speed and the liquid properties. If\nthe coating material contains particles, they will only be entrained when the\nviscous force pulling them with the substrate overcomes the opposing capillary\nforce at the deformable meniscus. This force threshold occurs at different\nliquid thicknesses for particles of different sizes. Here, we show that this\ndifference can be used to separate small particles from a mixed suspension\nthrough capillary filtration. In a bidisperse suspension, we observe three\ndistinct filtration regimes. At low capillary numbers, Ca, no particles are\nentrained in the liquid coating. At high Ca, all particle sizes are entrained.\nFor a range of capillary numbers between these two extremes, only the smallest\nparticles are entrained while the larger ones remain in the reservoir. We\nexplain how this technique can be applied to polydisperse suspension. We also\nprovide an estimate of the range of capillary number to separate particles of\ngiven sizes.

A key challenge of\nlearning legged locomotion is describing different gaits, via reward functions,\nin a way that is intuitive for the designer and specific enough to reliably\nlearn the gait across different initial random seeds or hyperparameters. A\ncommon approach is to use reference motions (e.g. trajectories of joint\npositions) to guide learning.

Due to the limited\nknowledge about the physical and perceptual characteristics of the guided\nagent, this task should be conducted on a level of abstraction allowing the use\nof a generic motion model, and high-level commands, that can be applied by any\ntype of autonomous agents, including humans. The main task considered in this\nwork is, given a group of autonomous agents perceiving their common environment\nwith their independent, egocentric and local vision sensors, the development\nand evaluation of algorithms capable of producing a set of high-level commands\n(involving qualitative directions: e.g. move left, go straight ahead) capable\nof guiding a sensory deprived robot to a goal location.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2020 00:34:26 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-30"}

For example, at a range greater than 60 meters, the\nsparsity of lidar pointclouds reaches to a point where even humans cannot\ndiscern object shapes from each other. However, this distance should not be\nconsidered very far for fast-moving vehicles: A vehicle can traverse 60 meters\nunder two seconds while moving at 70 mph. For safe and robust driving\nautomation, acute 3D object detection at these ranges is indispensable. Against\nthis backdrop, we introduce faraway-frustum: a novel fusion strategy for\ndetecting faraway objects. The main strategy is to depend solely on the 2D\nvision for recognizing object class, as object shape does not change\ndrastically with an increase in depth, and use pointcloud data for object\nlocalization in the 3D space for faraway objects. For closer objects, we use\nlearned pointcloud representations instead, following state-of-the-art. This\nstrategy alleviates the main shortcoming of object detection with learned\npointcloud representations.

Deep networks are, however,\ncapable of inducing strong and hardly predictable hallucinations. Networks\nimplicitly learn to be jointly faithful to the observed data while learning an\nimage prior; and the separation of original data and hallucinated data\ndownstream is then not possible. This limits their wide-spread adoption in\nimage restoration. Furthermore, it is often the hallucinated part that is\nvictim to degradation-model overfitting.\n  We present an approach with decoupled network-prior based hallucination and\ndata fidelity terms.

The\nexisting Erasure-coded data repair schemes are roughly classified into two\ncategories: 1. Designing rapid data repair (e.g., PPR) in a homogeneous\nenvironment. 2. Constructing data repair (e.g., PPT) based on bandwidth in a\nheterogeneous environment. However, these solutions are difficult to cope with\nthe heterogeneous and Rapidly-changing network in erasure-coded clusters. To\naddress this problem, a bandwidth-aware multi-level forwarding repair\nalgorithm, called BMFRepair, is proposed. BMFRepair monitors the network\nbandwidth in real time when data is forwarded, and selects idle nodes with\nhigh-bandwidth links to assist in forwarding. Thus, it can reduce the time\nbottleneck caused by low link transmission. At the same time, multi-node repair\nbecomes very complicated when the bandwidth changes drastically. A multi-node\nscheduling repairing algorithm, called MSRepair, is proposed for multi-node\nrepairing problems, which can repair multiple failed blocks in parallel by\nscheduling node resources. The two algorithms can flexibly adapt to the rapidly\nchanging network environment and make full use of the bandwidth resources of\nidle nodes. Most importantly, algorithms can continuously adjust the repair\nplan according to the bandwidth change in fast and dynamic network. The\nalgorithms have been evaluated by both simulations on Mininet and real\nexperiments on Aliyun cloud platform ECS.

Langevin dynamics are mapped onto an equivalent quantum\nmechanical (QM) system. Borrowing ideas from supersymmetric quantum mechanics\n(SUSY QM), a parameterized ground state wave function (WF) of this QM system is\nused as a direct input to the model, which also fixes a non-linear Langevin\npotential. Using a two-component Gaussian mixture as a ground state WF with an\nasymmetric double well potential produces a tractable low-parametric model with\ninterpretable parameters, referred to as the NES (Non-Equilibrium Skew) model.\nSupersymmetry (SUSY) is then used to find time-dependent solutions of the model\nin an analytically tractable way.

In\nthis context, deriving embeddings that preserve the geometry of the network and\nthe attribute vectors would be highly desirable, as they would reflect both the\ntopological neighborhood structure and proximity in feature space. While this\nis fairly straightforward to maintain when only observing the connectivity or\nattribute information of the network, preserving the geometry of both types of\ninformation is challenging. A novel tensor factorization approach for node\nembedding in attributed networks is proposed in this paper, that preserves the\ndistances of both the connections and the attributes.

With this we are able of recover and extend in one goal\nseveral results of the literature.\n  In particular, we obtain robust online algorithm for fairly general online\nconvex problems: we consider the MIXED model where in some of the time steps\nthe data is stochastic and in the others the data is adversarial. Both the\nquantity and location of the adversarial time steps are unknown to the\nalgorithm. The guarantees of our algorithms interpolate between the (close to)\nbest guarantees for each of the pure models. In particular, the presence of\nadversarial times does not degrade the guarantee relative to the stochastic\npart of the instance.\n  Concretely, we first consider Online Convex Programming: at each time a\nfeasible set $V_t$ is revealed, and the algorithm needs to select $v_t \\in V_t$\nto minimize the total cost $\\psi(\\sum_t v_t)$, for a convex function $\\psi$.\nOur robust primal-dual algorithm for this problem on the MIXED model recovers\nand extends, for example, a result of Gupta et al. and recent work on\n$\\ell_p$-norm load balancing by the author.

The\nlongitudinal and transverse QS couplings can be changed by rotating a magnetic\nfield, which depends on a combination of the strain modes. Using the Floquet\ntheory, we elucidate each coupling effect on the time-averaged transition\nprobability, especially focus on a single-phonon transition process. The\nimportant result is that the longitudinal QS coupling brings about a sharp\nphoton-assisted resonance and leads to an abrupt change in the field-angle\ndependent transition probability. Since this phonon transition process is\nalways accompanied by the photon transition, the field angle for the sharp\nresonance peak can be detected by the EPR measurement.

To meet the requirements of\nthe fencing experts, we designed and implemented FencingVis, an interactive\nvisualization system for fencing competition data.The action sequences in the\nbout are first visualized by modified bar charts to reveal the actions of\nfootworks and bladeworks of both fencers. Then an interactive technique is\nprovided for exploring the patterns of behavior of fencers. The different\ncombinations of tactical behavior patterns are further mapped to the graph\nmodel and visualized by a tactical flow graph. This graph can reveal the\ndifferent strategies adopted by both fencers and their mutual influence in one\nbout. We also provided a number of well-coordinated views to supplement the\ntactical flow graph and display the information of the fencing competition from\ndifferent perspectives. The well-coordinated views are meant to organically\nintegrate with the tactical flow graph through consistent visual style and view\ncoordination. We demonstrated the usability and effectiveness of the proposed\nsystem with three case studies. On the basis of expert feedback, FencingVis can\nhelp analysts find not only the tactical patterns hidden in fencing bouts, but\nalso the technical and tactical characteristics of the contestant.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2020 03:26:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-04"}

There are mainly two versions of the load\nbalancing problem that have been studied in the literature: static and dynamic.\nThe static interpretation leads to formulating the load balancing problem as a\ncase with jobs (balls) never leaving the system and accumulating at the servers\n(bins) whereas the dynamic setting deals with the case when jobs arrive and\nleave the system after service completion. This paper designs and evaluates\nserver proximity aware job allocation policies for treating load balancing\nproblems with a goal to reduce the communication cost associated with the jobs.\nWe consider a class of proximity aware Power of Two (POT) choice based\nassignment policies for allocating jobs to servers, where servers are\ninterconnected as an n-vertex graph G(V, E). For the static version, we assume\neach job arrives at one of the servers, u. For the dynamic setting, we assume G\nto be a circular graph and job arrival process at each server is described by a\nPoisson point process with the job service time exponentially distributed. For\nboth settings, we then assign each job to the server with minimum load among\nservers u and v where v is chosen according to one of the following two\npolicies: (i) Unif-POT(k): Sample a server v uniformly at random from k-hop\nneighborhood of u (ii) InvSq-POT(k): Sample a server v from k-hop neighborhood\nof u with probability proportional to the inverse square of the distance\nbetween u and v. Our simulation results show that both the policies\nconsistently produce a load distribution which is much similar to that of a\nclassical proximity oblivious POT policy.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2020 05:15:23 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-04"}

Firstly, the general\naccumulative operation sequence of multivariate compositional data is defined\naccording to Aitchison geometry, then obtaining the novel model with the form\nof the compositional data vectors. Secondly, this paper studies the least\nsquare parameter estimation of the model. The novel model is deduced and\nselected as the time-response expression of the solution. Thirdly, this paper\ninfuses the novel model with traditional grey model to improve its robustness.\nDifferential Evolution algorithm is introduced to determine the optimal value\nof the general matrix. Lastly, two validation examples are provided for\nconfirming the effectiveness of the novel model by comparing it with other\nexisting models, before being employed to forecast the crude oil import\nstructure in China. The results show that the novel model provides better\nperformance in all crude oil cases in short-term forecasting. Therefore, by\nusing the new model, China's development parameter is 0.5214 and Determination\nFactor of the novel model is 0.5999, which means that the crude oil import\nstructure of China is being changed. Specifically, the amount of crude oil\nimported from the Arctic area is obviously increasing in the next 6 years,\nshowing sufficient proof of the edge owned by the Arctic area: abundant crude\noil reserves and shortening transportation distance.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2020 06:31:47 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-04"}

The uplink-and-downlink spectrum sharing is becoming a viable solution\nto enhance the uplink throughput of NPNs, which allows the NPNs to perform the\nuplink transmission over the time-frequency resources configured for downlink\ntransmission in coexisting public networks. To deal with the severe\ninterference from the downlink public base station (BS) transmitter to the\ncoexisting uplink non-public BS receiver, we propose an adaptive asymmetric\nsuccessive interference cancellation (SIC) approach, in which the non-public BS\nreceiver is enabled to have the capability of decoding the downlink signals\ntransmitted from the public BS and successively cancelling them for\ninterference mitigation. In particular, this paper studies a basic\nuplink-and-downlink spectrum sharing scenario when an uplink non-public BS and\na downlink public BS coexist in the same area, each communicating with multiple\nusers via orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA). Under this\nsetup, we aim to maximize the common uplink throughput of all non-public users,\nunder the condition that the downlink throughput of each public user is above a\ncertain threshold. The decision variables include the subcarrier allocation and\nuser scheduling for both non-public (uplink) and public (downlink) BSs, the\ndecoding mode of the non-public BS over each subcarrier (i.e., with or without\nSIC), as well as the rate and power control over subcarriers.

In particular, we investigate how droplets respond to different\nambient temperatures and relative humidity (RH) by tracking their Lagrangian\nstatistics.

Consequently, the super-saturated vapour field drives\nthe growth of droplets that are caught and transported within the humid puff.\nTo analytically predict the likelihood for droplet growth, we propose a model\nfor the axial RH based on the assumption of a quasi-stationary jet.

Here, we\nreport JCMT POL-2 850 $\\mu$m polarization and IRAM 30-m C$^{18}$O (2-1) line\nobservations toward the massive HFS G33.92+0.11. The 850 $\\mu$m continuum map\nreveals four major filaments converging to the center of G33.92+0.11 with\nnumerous short filaments connecting to the major filaments at local intensity\npeaks. We estimate the local orientations of filaments, magnetic field,\ngravity, and velocity gradients from observations, and we examine their\ncorrelations based on their local properties. In the high-density areas, our\nanalysis shows that the filaments tend to align with the magnetic field and\nlocal gravity. In the low-density areas, we find that the local velocity\ngradients tend to be perpendicular to both the magnetic field and local\ngravity, although the filaments still tend to align with local gravity. A\nglobal virial analysis suggests that the gravitational energy overall dominates\nthe magnetic and kinematic energy. Combining local and global aspects, we\nconclude that the formation of G33.92+0.11 is predominantly driven by gravity,\ndragging and aligning the major filaments and magnetic field on the way to the\ninner dense center. Traced by local velocity gradients in the outer diffuse\nareas, ambient gas might be accreted onto the major filaments directly or via\nthe short filaments.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2020 08:14:13 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-06"}

With this, T Sex may be the first represent\nof such rare RRc stars found from space photometry. The spectroscopic data show\na periodic distortion of the H$\\alpha$ line with the pulsation phase. This\nphenomenon has not been reported for any RR Lyrae stars. The characteristic\nline distortion is probably caused by the turbulent convection, which resulted\nin higher macroturbulent velocity for T Sex than for typical RRab stars. Line\ndoubling of the Na D line was observed between the 0.37 and 0.80 pulsation\nphases. The explanation of this phenomenon is that the two absorption\ncomponents originate from different sources. The redder component comes from\nthe pulsating atmosphere of the star, while the bluer one from the interstellar\nspace.

In a time frame of 50 days, the\nUV spectra of AT2019qiz started to resemble previous TDEs with only\nhigh-ionization BALs.

Though it has been shown that jointly\nmodeling stimulus and emotion category prediction is beneficial for both\nsubtasks, it remains unclear which of these semantic roles enables a classifier\nto infer the emotion. Is it the experiencer, because the identity of a person\nis biased towards a particular emotion (X is always happy)?

We\nanswer these questions by training emotion classification models on five\navailable datasets annotated with at least one semantic role by masking the\nfillers of these roles in the text in a controlled manner and find that across\nmultiple corpora, stimuli and targets carry emotion information, while the\nexperiencer might be considered a confounder.

Carefully examining\nsemantics-related issues in the modeling languages field to avoid problems that\nmay affect practical applicability is important. One effort in this direction\nis OMG s release of a 2020 draft specification for Foundational UML (fUML),\nwith the base semantics specifying executions that are executable in the same\nsense as a program in a traditional programming language. Additionally, efforts\nwithin academia have sought to develop an alternative approach to modeling\nlanguages using formal semantics (e.g., using Russell s theory of types and\nTarski s declarative semantics). This paper aims at a similar exploratory\nventure of developing semantics, only for a much more modest diagrammatic\nmodeling language, called the thinging machine model. The model promotes a deep\nunderstanding of the scrutinized modeling language and leads to considerably\nfruitful questions. Constructing the thinging machine model seems to facilitate\nprogress in this direction, and the initial results in this paper indicate the\nviability of the approach.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2020 10:39:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-04"}

This leads to\nthe so called generalized bootstrap setting for which minimum divergence\ninference seems to replace Maximum Likelihood one. 1 Motivation and context\nDivergences between probability measures are widely used in Statistics and Data\nScience in order to perform inference under models of various kinds,\nparamet-ric or semi parametric, or even in non parametric settings. The\ncorresponding methods extend the likelihood paradigm and insert inference in\nsome minimum \"distance\" framing, which provides a convenient description for\nthe properties of the resulting estimators and tests, under the model or under\nmisspecifica-tion. Furthermore they pave the way to a large number of\ncompetitive methods , which allows for trade-off between efficiency and\nrobustness, among others. Many families of such divergences have been proposed,\nsome of them stemming from classical statistics (such as the Chi-square), while\nothers have their origin in other fields such as Information theory. Some\nmeasures of discrepancy involve regularity of the corresponding probability\nmeasures while others seem to be restricted to measures on finite or countable\nspaces, at least when using them as inferential tools, henceforth in situations\nwhen the elements of a model have to be confronted with a dataset. The choice\nof a specific discrepancy measure in specific context is somehow arbitrary in\nmany cases, although the resulting conclusion of the inference might differ\naccordingly, above all under misspecification; however the need for such\napproaches is clear when aiming at robustness.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2020 10:57:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-24"}

Moreover, causal Shapley values enable us to separate the\ncontribution of direct and indirect effects. We provide a practical\nimplementation for computing causal Shapley values based on causal chain graphs\nwhen only partial information is available and illustrate their utility on a\nreal-world example.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2020 11:11:36 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-04"}

Time-dependent density functional theory\ncalculations show that hypericin is cycling between the four most stable\ntautomers. This approach allows to unambiguously assign a TDM orientation to a\nspecific tautomer and enables to determine the chemical structure in situ.\nAdditionally, tautomerization can not only be observed by the image pattern\norientation, but also as intermittency in the fluorescence emission of a single\nmolecule. Time correlated single photon counting enables to determine the\nexcited state lifetimes of the hypericin tautomers. Our approach is not only\nlimited to hypericin, but can be applied to other molecules showing a TDM\nreorientation during tautomerization, helping to get a deeper understanding of\nthis important process.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2020 11:48:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-04"}

The method is also used for reducing dimensionality of model output\nand consequently emulating highly complex relationship between hydrogeological\nproperties and reduced order fluid velocity field in a tractable manner. Deep\nGPs are multi-layer hierarchical generalisations of GPs with multiple,\ninfinitely wide hidden layers that are very efficient models for deep learning\nand modelling of high-dimensional complex systems by tackling the complexity\nthrough several hidden layers connected with non-linear mappings. According to\nthis approach, the hydrogeological data is modelled as the output of a\nmultivariate GP whose inputs are governed by another GP such that each single\nlayer is either a standard GP or the Gaussian process latent variable model. A\nvariational approximation framework is used so that the posterior distribution\nof the model outputs associated to given inputs can be analytically\napproximated. In contrast to the other dimensionality reduction, methods that\ndo not provide any information about the dimensionality of each hidden layer,\nthe proposed method automatically selects the dimensionality of each hidden\nlayer and it can be used to propagate uncertainty obtained in each layer across\nthe hierarchy. Using this, dimensionality of the full input space consists of\nboth geometrical parameters of modelling domain and stochastic hydrogeological\nparameters can be simultaneously reduced without the need for any\nsimplifications generally being assumed for stochastic modelling of subsurface\nflow problems. It allows estimation of the flow statistics with greatly reduced\ncomputational efforts compared to other stochastic approaches such as Monte\nCarlo method.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2020 11:57:38 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 5 Nov 2020 11:31:03 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-06"}

Model-based\nspeaker adaptation is a promising method by using the limited dysarthric speech\nto fine-tune a base model that has been pre-trained from large amounts of\nnormal speech to obtain speaker-dependent models. However, statistic\ndistribution mismatches between the normal and dysarthric speech data limit the\nadaptation performance of the base model. To address this problem, we propose\nto re-initialize the base model via meta-learning to obtain a better model\ninitialization. Specifically, we focus on end-to-end models and extend the\nmodel-agnostic meta learning (MAML) and Reptile algorithms to meta update the\nbase model by repeatedly simulating adaptation to different dysarthric\nspeakers. As a result, the re-initialized model acquires dysarthric speech\nknowledge and learns how to perform fast adaptation to unseen dysarthric\nspeakers with improved performance. Experimental results on UASpeech dataset\nshow that the best model with proposed methods achieves 54.2% and 7.6% relative\nword error rate reduction compared with the base model without finetuning and\nthe model directly fine-tuned from the base model, respectively, and it is\ncomparable with the state-of-the-art hybrid DNN-HMM model.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2020 13:21:51 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-04"}

In this paper, we provide a qualified response to this\nchallenge that significantly weakens the absolutist position. We present a\ntheory that, contrary to orthodoxy, can account for all rotational effects\nwithout introducing, as the absolutist does, a fixed standard of rotation.\nInstead, our theory posits a universal SO(3) charge that plays the role of\nangular momentum and couples to inter-particle relations via terms commonly\nseen in standard gauge theories such as electromagnetism and the Standard Model\nof particle physics. Our theory makes use of an enriched form of relationalism:\nit adds an SO(3) structure to the traditional relational description. Our\nconstruction is made possible by the modern tools of gauge theory, which reveal\na simple relational law describing rotational effects.

However, previous papers have reported mixed success in\nzero-shot translation. It is hard to predict in which settings it will be\neffective, and what limits performance compared to a fully supervised system.\nIn this paper, we investigate zero-shot performance of a multilingual\nEN$\\leftrightarrow${FR,CS,DE,FI} system trained on WMT data. We find that\nzero-shot performance is highly unstable and can vary by more than 6 BLEU\nbetween training runs, making it difficult to reliably track improvements. We\nobserve a bias towards copying the source in zero-shot translation, and\ninvestigate how the choice of subword segmentation affects this bias. We find\nthat language-specific subword segmentation results in less subword copying at\ntraining time, and leads to better zero-shot performance compared to jointly\ntrained segmentation. A recent trend in multilingual models is to not train on\nparallel data between all language pairs, but have a single bridge language,\ne.g. English. We find that this negatively affects zero-shot translation and\nleads to a failure mode where the model ignores the language tag and instead\nproduces English output in zero-shot directions. We show that this bias towards\nEnglish can be effectively reduced with even a small amount of parallel data in\nsome of the non-English pairs.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2020 13:45:54 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-04"}

The radiation of a closely located\nnormally oriented dipole is shaped by the microsphere so that the transmitted\nwave beam has a practically flat phase front.

However, these techniques require us\nto formalise assumptions about the data-generating process at the group level,\nwhich may not be known. Specifically, researchers typically must choose whether\nto assume all subjects are drawn from a common population, or to model them as\nderiving from separate populations. These assumptions have profound\nimplications for computational psychiatry, as they affect the resulting\ninference (latent parameter recovery) and may conflate or mask true group-level\ndifferences. To test these assumptions we ran systematic simulations on\nsynthetic multi-group behavioural data from a commonly used multi-armed bandit\ntask (reinforcement learning task). We then examined recovery of group\ndifferences in latent parameter space under the two commonly used generative\nmodelling assumptions: (1) modelling groups under a common shared group-level\nprior (assuming all participants are generated from a common distribution, and\nare likely to share common characteristics); (2) modelling separate groups\nbased on symptomatology or diagnostic labels, resulting in separate group-level\npriors. We evaluated the robustness of these approaches to variations in data\nquality and prior specifications on a variety of metrics. We found that fitting\ngroups separately (assumptions 2), provided the most accurate and robust\ninference across all conditions.

Considerable\nattention in recent years has been devoted to analyzing and modeling signed\ngraphs, where the affinity measure between nodes takes either positive or\nnegative values. Recently, Cucuringu et al.

This approach is motivated by social\nbalance theory, where the clustering task aims to decompose a given network\ninto disjoint groups, such that individuals within the same group are connected\nby as many positive edges as possible, while individuals from different groups\nare mainly connected by negative edges. Through extensive numerical\nsimulations, SPONGE was shown to achieve state-of-the-art empirical\nperformance. On the theoretical front, [CDGT 2019] analyzed SPONGE and the\npopular Signed Laplacian method under the setting of a Signed Stochastic Block\nModel (SSBM), for $k=2$ equal-sized clusters, in the regime where the graph is\nmoderately dense.\n  In this work, we build on the results in [CDGT 2019] on two fronts for the\nnormalized versions of SPONGE and the Signed Laplacian.

In this\nwork, we demonstrate that a higher order topological phase can be engineered in\na nonequilibrium state when the time-independent model does not possess any\nsymmetry protected topological states.

With the rapid\ndevelopment of computers and computational techniques, discrete-based numerical\napproaches with desirable properties have been increasingly developed, but few\nattempts to consider the particle surface roughness in a lattice type model.\nFor this purpose, an integrated numerical scheme accounting rough contact\ndeformation is developed by coupling modified LSM and DFN modeling for\npredicting the effective mechanical properties of a realistic outcrop. Smooth\njoint logic is introduced to consider contact and slip behaviors at fracture\nsurfaces and a modified contact relation to estimating the normal\nforce-displacement from rough contact deformation. Improved constitutive laws\nare developed and employed for rock matrix and rough fracture surface and\nimplemented in the modified LSM. Complex fracture networks presented by DFNs\nare automatically extracted based on the gradient Hough transform algorithm.\nThis developed framework is validated by classic equivalent medium theories. It\nshows the model could be used to emulate naturally-fractured media and to\nquantitatively investigate the effects of fracture attributes and micro-scale\nsurface roughness on the compression mechanism.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2020 15:01:45 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-04"}

A major theme in RM is therefore\nthe study of structures that are countable or can be approximated by countable\nsets. Now, countable sets are represented by sequences here, because the usual\nhigher-order definition of `countable set'cannot be expressed in $L_{2}$.\nWorking in Kohlenbach's higher-order RM, we investigate various central\ntheorems, e.g. those due to K\\\"onig, Ramsey, Bolzano, Weierstrass, and Borel,\nin their (often original) formulation involving the usual definition(s) of\n`countable set' instead of `sequence'.

Therefore, where those activities present\ndifficulties for people with chronic pain, technology-enabled support should be\ndelivered continuously and automatically adapted to activity type and\noccurrence of protective behavior. Hence, to facilitate ubiquitous CP\nmanagement, it becomes critical to enable accurate PBD over continuous data.

A Parallel and Distributed\nComputing (or PDC) scheme, termed Federated Learning (FL), has emerged as a new\nparadigm to cope with the privacy issue by allowing clients to perform model\ntraining locally, without the necessity to upload their personal sensitive\ndata. In FL, the number of clients could be sufficiently large, but the\nbandwidth available for model distribution and re-upload is quite limited,\nmaking it sensible to only involve part of the volunteers to participate in the\ntraining process. The client selection policy is critical to an FL process in\nterms of training efficiency, the final model's quality as well as fairness. In\nthis paper, we will model the fairness guaranteed client selection as a\nLyapunov optimization problem and then a C2MAB-based method is proposed for\nestimation of the model exchange time between each client and the server, based\non which we design a fairness guaranteed algorithm termed RBCS-F for\nproblem-solving. The regret of RBCS-F is strictly bounded by a finite constant,\njustifying its theoretical feasibility.

The goal is to determine collision-free and dynamically\nfeasible trajectories that also maximize human satisfaction. This is because\nthey may drive the robot close to humans that need help with their work or\nbecause they may keep the robot away from humans when it can interfere with\nhuman sight or work. In practice, human satisfaction is subjective and hard to\ndescribe mathematically. As a result, the planning problem we consider in this\npaper may lack important contextual information. To address this challenge, we\npropose a semi-supervised Bayesian Optimization (BO) method to design globally\noptimal robot trajectories using non-contextual bandit human feedback in the\nform of complaints or satisfaction ratings that express how satisfactory a\ntrajectory is, without revealing the reason. Since trajectory planning is\ntypically a high-dimensional optimization problem in the space of waypoints\nthat define a trajectory, BO may require prohibitively many queries for human\nfeedback to return a good solution. To this end, we use an autoencoder to\nreduce the high-dimensional problem space into a low dimensional latent space,\nwhich we update using human feedback. Moreover, we improve the exploration\nefficiency of BO by biasing the search for new trajectories towards dynamically\nfeasible and collision-free trajectories obtained using off-the-shelf motion\nplanners. We demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed trajectory planning\nmethod in a scenario with humans that have diversified and unknown demands.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2020 15:38:41 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-04"}

The $T_C$ amplification is achieved tuning the Fermi\nlevel near the singular nodal point at a Lifshitz transition for opening a\nneck. Recently high interest has been addressed to the breaking of inversion\nsymmetry which leads to a linear-in-momentum spin-orbit induced spin splitting,\nuniversally referred to as Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) also in 3D layered\nmetals. However the physics of multi-gap superconductivity near unconventional\nLifshitz transitions in 3D HAL with RSOC, being in a non-BCS regime, is not\nknown. The key result of this work getting the superconducting gaps by\nBogoliubov theory and the 3D electron wave functions by solution of the Dirac\nequation is the feasibility of tuning multi-gap superconductivity by suitably\nmatching the spin-orbit length with the 3D superlattice period. It is found\nthat the presence of the RSOC amplifies both the k dependent anisotropic gap\nfunction and the critical temperature when the Fermi energy is tuned near the\ncircular nodal line. Our results suggest a method to effectively vary the\neffect of RSOC on macroscopic superconductor condensates via the tuning of the\nsuperlattice modulation parameter in a way potentially relevant for spintronics\nfunctionalities in several existing experimental platforms and tunable\nmaterials needed for quantum devices for quantum computing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2020 15:06:34 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 2 Feb 2021 06:45:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-02-03"}

The success of this\nsystem in tests of GR is largely due to the high-precision, long-term timing of\nits recycled-pulsar member, pulsar A. On the other hand, pulsar B is a young\npulsar that exhibits significant short-term and long-term timing variations due\nto the electromagnetic-wind interaction with its companion and geodetic\nprecession. Improving pulsar B's timing precision is a key step towards\nimproving the precision in a number of GR tests with PSR J0737-3039A/B. In this\npaper, red noise signatures in the timing of pulsar B are investigated using\nroughly a four-year time span, from 2004 to 2008, beyond which time the\npulsar's radio beam precessed out of view ... The timing of pulsar B presented\nin this paper depends on the size of the pulsar's orbit, which was calculated\nfrom GR, in order to precisely account for orbital timing delays. Consequently,\nour timing cannot directly be used to test theories of gravity. However, our\nmodelling of the beam shape and radial wind of pulsar B can indirectly aid\nfuture efforts to time this pulsar by constraining part of the additional red\nnoise observed on top of the orbital delays. As such, we conclude that, in the\nidealised case of zero covariance between our model's parameters and those of\nthe timing model, our model can bring about a factor 2.6 improvement on the\nmeasurement precision of the mass ratio, R = mA/mB, between the two pulsars: a\ntheory-independent parameter, which is pivotal in tests of GR.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 3 Nov 2020 15:05:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-18"}

The\nreality however is that digital records suffer similar risks of access loss as\nthe analogue versions they replace. Often this risk is outsourced to\nspecialised third parties. Common use cases include Personal Information\nManagement (PIM): e.g. calendars, diaries, tasks, etc. Frequently these are\noutsourced at two removes - firstly by the individual to their employer (e.g.\nusing a company system) and then by their employer to an external provider.

Compared with active sensor networks,\npassive sensor networks have larger uncertainty due to the nature of passive\nsensing. Multi-target tracking in passive sensor networks is challenging\nbecause the multi-sensor multi-target fusion problem is difficult and sensor\nmanagement is necessary to achieve good trade-offs between tracking accuracy\nand energy consumption or other costs. To address this problem, we present an\nefficient information-theoretic approach to manage the sensors for better\ntracking of the unknown and time-varying number of targets. This is\naccomplished with two main technical innovations. The first is a tractable\ninformation-based multi-sensor selection solution via a partially observed\nMarkov decision process framework. The Cauchy-Schwarz divergence is used as the\ncriterion to select informative sensors sequentially from the candidates. The\nsecond is a novel dual-stage fusion strategy based on the iterated-corrector\nmulti-sensor generalized labeled multi-Bernoulli filter. Since the performance\nof the iterated-corrector scheme is greatly influenced by the order of sensor\nupdates, the selected sensors are first ranked in order of their abilities to\ndetect targets according to the Cauchy-Schwarz divergence, followed the\niterated-corrector update. The computation costs of ranking the sensors are\nnegligible, since the Cauchy-Schwarz divergence has been computed in the\nmulti-sensor selection procedure.

At the TCV tokamak, aside from the Low (L) and High (H)\nconfinement modes, an additional mode, dithering (D), is frequently observed.\nDeveloping methods that automatically detect these modes is considered to be\nimportant for future tokamak operation. Previous work with deep learning\nmethods, particularly convolutional recurrent neural networks (Conv-RNNs),\nindicates that they are a suitable approach. Nevertheless, those models are\nsensitive to noise in the temporal alignment of labels, and that model in\nparticular is limited to making individual decisions taking into account only\nits own hidden state and its input at each time step. In this work, we propose\nan architecture for a sequence-to-sequence neural network model with attention\nwhich solves both of those issues. Using a carefully calibrated dataset, we\ncompare the performance of a Conv-RNN with that of our proposed\nsequence-to-sequence model, and show two results: one, that the Conv-RNN can be\nimproved upon with new data; two, that the sequence-to-sequence model can\nimprove the results even further, achieving excellent scores on both train and\ntest data.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Nov 2020 16:59:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-26"}

These issues\nbecome evident when the light-matter interaction reaches the so-called\nultrastrong coupling regime. Recently, a modified quantum Rabi model able to\nprovide gauge-invariant physical results (e.g., energy levels, expectation\nvalues of observables, quantum probabilities) in any interaction regime was\nintroduced [Nature Physics 15, 803 (2019)]. Here we provide an alternative\nderivation of this result, based on the implementation in two-state systems of\nthe gauge principle, which is the principle from which all the fundamental\ninteractions in quantum field theory are derived. The adopted procedure can be\nregarded as the two-site version of the general method used to implement the\ngauge principle in lattice gauge theories. Applying this method, we also obtain\nthe gauge-invariant quantum Rabi model for asymmetric two-state systems, and\nthe multi-mode gauge-invariant quantum Rabi model beyond the dipole\napproximation.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 2 Nov 2020 17:49:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-19"}
