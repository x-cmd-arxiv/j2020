Current\napproaches are primarily based on harnessing the power of deep learning models\nand optimization techniques to reverse the degradation model. Owing to its\nhardness, isotropic blurring or Gaussians with small anisotropic deformations\nhave been mainly considered. Here, we widen this scenario by including large\nnon-Gaussian blurs that arise in real camera movements. Our approach leverages\nthe degradation model and proposes a new formulation of the Convolutional\nNeural Network (CNN) cascade model, where each network sub-module is\nconstrained to solve a specific degradation: deblurring or upsampling. A new\ndensely connected CNN-architecture is proposed where the output of each\nsub-module is restricted using some external knowledge to focus it on its\nspecific task. As far we know this use of domain-knowledge to module-level is a\nnovelty in SISR. To fit the finest model, a final sub-module takes care of the\nresidual errors propagated by the previous sub-modules. We check our model with\nthree state of the art (SOTA) datasets in SISR and compare the results with the\nSOTA models. The results show that our model is the only one able to manage our\nwider set of deformations. Furthermore, our model overcomes all current SOTA\nmethods for a standard set of deformations. In terms of computational load, our\nmodel also improves on the two closest competitors in terms of efficiency.\nAlthough the approach is non-blind and requires an estimation of the blur\nkernel, it shows robustness to blur kernel estimation errors, making it a good\nalternative to blind models.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 18:59:49 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-05-19"}

Following the most\nrecent Planck analysis, we decompose the full time-dependent gain into a sum of\nthree orthogonal components: One absolute calibration term, common to all\ndetectors; one time-independent term that can vary between detectors; and one\ntime-dependent component that is allowed to vary between one-hour pointing\nperiods. Each term is then sampled conditionally on all other parameters in the\nglobal signal model through Gibbs sampling. The absolute calibration is sampled\nusing only the orbital dipole as a reference source, while the two relative\ngain components are sampled using the full sky signal, including the orbital\nand Solar CMB dipoles, CMB fluctuations, and foreground contributions. We\ndiscuss various aspects of the data that influence gain estimation, including\nthe dipole/polarization quadrupole degeneracy and anomalous jumps in the\ninstrumental gain. Comparing our solution to previous pipelines, we find good\nagreement in general, with relative deviations of -0.67% (-0.84%) for 30 GHz,\n0.12% (-0.04%) for 44 GHz and -0.03% (-0.64%) for 70 GHz, compared to Planck\nDR4 (Planck 2018). The deviations we find are within expected error bounds, and\nwe attribute them to differences in data usage and general approach between the\npipelines.

A\ncountermeasure technology for the flaming phenomena based on the oscillation\nmodel, which describes online user dynamics, has been proposed; it is an\nimmediate solution as it does not depend on social analyses of individuals.\nConventional countermeasures based on the oscillation model assume that the\ndamping coefficient is a constant regardless of the eigenfrequency.

This requires the modelling of magnetic\nfields between Earth and the blazar. So far, only very simple models for the\nmagnetic field in the blazar jet have been used. Here we investigate the\neffects of more complicated jet magnetic field configurations on these spectral\nirregularities, by imposing a magnetic field structure model onto the jet model\nproposed by Potter & Cotter.

However, reasonable (i.e.\nconsistent with observation) changes of the magnetic field structure can have a\nlarge effect on the mixing.

Furthermore, the\npresent study confirms the experimental scenario that Y site substitution does\nnot lead to enhancement of the powerfactor because of the breaking of band\ndegeneracies at the high symmetry points. This work will serve as a\nconsolidated cost effective guideline for experimentalist working with this\ncompound class on enhancing the powerfactor and figure of merit of the\ncompositions.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 17:57:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-17"}

Various solutions,\ne.g., sample selection, label correction, and robustifying loss functions, have\nbeen proposed for this challenge, and most of them stick to the end-to-end\ntraining of the representation (feature extractor) and classifier. In this\npaper, by a deep rethinking and careful re-examining on learning behaviors of\nthe representation and classifier, we discover that the representation is much\nmore fragile in the presence of noisy labels than the classifier. Thus, we are\nmotivated to design a new method, i.e., REED, to leverage above discoveries to\nlearn from noisy labels robustly. The proposed method contains three stages,\ni.e., obtaining the representation by self-supervised learning without any\nlabels, transferring the noisy label learning problem into a semisupervised one\nby the classifier directly and reliably trained with noisy labels, and joint\nsemi-supervised retraining of both the representation and classifier.

Recent progress in classifying the difficulty of spectral problems\ninto complexity hierarchies has revealed that the most difficult spectral\nproblems are so hard that one needs three limits in the computation, and no\nconvergence rates nor error control is possible. This begs the question: which\nclasses of operators allow for computations with convergence rates and error\ncontrol? In this paper we address this basic question, and the algorithm used\nis an infinite-dimensional version of the QR algorithm. Indeed, we generalise\nthe QR algorithm to infinite-dimensional operators. We prove that not only is\nthe algorithm executable on a finite machine, but one can also recover the\nextremal parts of the spectrum and corresponding eigenvectors, with convergence\nrates and error control. This allows for new classification results in the\nhierarchy of computational problems that existing algorithms have not been able\nto capture.

We show the JCMT\ndiscovery spectrum of PH3 can not be re-attributed to SO2, as the line width is\nlarger than observed for SO2 features, and the required abundance would be an\nextreme outlier. The JCMT spectrum is also consistent with our simple model,\nconstant PH3-abundance with altitude, with no discrepancy in line profile\n(within data limits); reconciliation with a full photochemical model is the\nsubject of future work. Section 2 presents initial results from re-processed\nALMA data. Villanueva et al. noted an issue with bandpass calibration. They\nhave worked on a partially re-processed subset of the ALMA data, so we note\nwhere their conclusions, and those of Greaves et al., are now superseded. To\nsummarise: we recover PH3 in Venus' atmosphere with ALMA (~5{\\sigma}\nconfidence). Localised abundance appears to peak at ~5-10 parts-per-billion\n(ppb), with suggestions of spatial variation. Advanced data-products suggest a\nplanet-averaged PH3 abundance ~1-4 ppb, lower than from the earlier ALMA\nprocessing (which indicated 7+ ppb). The ALMA data are reconcilable with the\nJCMT detection (~20 ppb) if there is order-of-magnitude temporal variation;\nmore advanced processing of the JCMT data is underway to check methods.\nIndependent PH3 measurements suggest possible altitude dependence (under ~5 ppb\nat 60+ km, up to ~100 ppb at 50+ km; see Section 2: Conclusions.). Given that\nboth ALMA and JCMT were working at the limit of observatory capabilities, new\nspectra should be obtained. The ALMA data in-hand are no longer limited by\ncalibration, but spectral ripples still exist, probably due to size and\nbrightness of Venus in relation to the primary beam. Further, spatial ripples\nare present, potentially reducing significance of real narrow spectral\nfeatures.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 18:59:18 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Thu, 10 Dec 2020 17:00:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-07-21"}

Hot bottom burning in\nasymptotic giant branch stars in the low-metallicity regime is a good candidate\nfor the first class.

This makes RS Cha, consisting of two $\\delta$ Scuti stars and with\npulsational characteristics influenced by tidal effects , the first such object\nobserved. We aim to investigate the pulsational properties of the eclipsing\nbinary RS Cha in terms of the theory of tidally perturbed pulsations. Based on\nphotometric time series obtained from the TESS satellite, we performed binary\nmodelling using PHOEBE to interpret the binary light curve and to allow the\ninvestigation of the pulsations of both components in RS Cha. We modelled the\ndetrended light curve with the superposition of linear modes. The frequencies\nwere then interpreted as self excited modes perturbed by tidal forces. We find\nevidence for tidally perturbed modes, which enables the identification of\npulsation modes. RS Cha mainly exhibits dipole modes, while one prominent $l=2$\nor $l=3$ mode is also inferred. The latter verifies previous results from\nspectroscopic time series. This work shows that RS Cha is an ideal candidate to\ntest the theory of tidally perturbed pulsations within the framework of\nasteroseismic modelling. The identification of multiple pulsation modes using\nthis theory is unprecedented and will be a keystone in the future of pre-main\nsequence asteroseismology. However, amplitude modulation caused by the changing\nlight ratio during the orbital phase in an eclipsing binary also plays a\nsignificant role, which can complicate mode identification.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 19:03:07 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-27"}

Methods: We use a\nnovel hybrid integration approach that combines the direct N-body code\n$\\varphi$-GRAPE with ETICS, a collisionless code that employs the\nself-consistent field method for force calculation. The hybrid approach shows\nconsiderable speed-up over direct summation for particle numbers $> 10^6$,\nwhile retaining accuracy of direct N-body for a subset of particles. During the\nSMBH binary evolution we monitor individual stellar interactions with the\nbinary in order to identify stars that noticeably contribute to the SMBH binary\nhardening. Results: We successfully identify and analyze in detail the\nproperties of stars that extract energy from the binary. We find that the\nsummed energy changes seen in these stars match very well with the overall\nbinary energy change, demonstrating that stellar interactions are the primary\ndrivers of SMBH binary hardening in triaxial, gas-poor systems. The slight\ntriaxiality of our system results in efficient loss cone refilling, avoiding\nthe final parsec problem.

Characterising the duty cycle of active galactic\nnuclei is crucial for understanding the impact of the energy they release on\nthe host galaxy. For radio AGN, this can be done by identifying dying (remnant)\nand restarted radio galaxies from their radio spectral properties. Using the\ncombination of images at 1400 MHz produced by Apertif, the new phased-array\nfeed receiver installed on the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope, and images\nat 150 MHz provided by LOFAR, we have derived resolved spectral index images\n(at a resolution of ~15 arcsec) for all the sources within ~6 deg^2 area of the\nLockman Hole region. We were able to select 15 extended radio sources with\nemission (partly or entirely) characterised by extremely steep spectral indices\n(steeper than 1.2). These objects represent radio sources in the remnant or the\nrestarted phases of their life cycle. Our findings suggest this cycle to be\nrelatively fast. They also show a variety of properties relevant for modelling\nthe evolution of radio galaxies. For example, the restarted activity can occur\nwhile the remnant structure from a previous phase of activity is still visible.\nThis provides constraints on the duration of the 'off' (dying) phase. In\nextended remnants with ultra-steep spectra at low frequencies, the activity\nlikely stopped a few hundred megayears ago, and they correspond to the older\ntail of the age distribution of radio galaxies, in agreement with simulations\nof radio source evolution. We find remnant radio sources with a variety of\nstructures (from double-lobed to amorphous), suggesting different types of\nprogenitors. The present work sets the stage for exploiting low-frequency\nspectral index studies of extended sources by taking advantage of the large\nareas common to the LOFAR and the Apertif surveys.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 19:32:11 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-04-14"}

Coulomb forces, for example, can in\nprinciple prevent the ultimate collapse of charged matter to a singularity.\nAlso, half a century ago, Mael Melvin noted that magnetic forcelines do not\ncollapse under their own gravity, no matter how strong the latter may be.\nInstead, magnetic fields seemed capable of stabilising themselves against\ngravitational self-contraction. Intrigued, Melvin wondered whether magnetism\ncould also support against the realistic collapse of charged matter. Here, we\nlook back into these issues by means of two complementary scenarios. The first\nreconsiders Melvin's highly idealised \"magnetic universe\" and reaches the same\nconclusion, namely that magnetic fields do not self-gravitate. The second is a\nrealistic collapse scenario, like that of magnetised massive compact stars.\nLooking for answers to Melvin's question, we find that magnetic fields do show\na generic tendency to support against relativistic gravitational implosion.

Extensive simulations on synthetic datasets with nonlinear and linear\ndependencies and known ground-truth demonstrate significant improvement in the\nArea Under the receiver operating characteristic Curve ( AUC ) of the receiver\noperating characteristic for network recovery compared to existing methods.\nFurthermore, tests on real datasets from a functional magnetic resonance\nimaging (fMRI) study demonstrate 96.3 percent accuracy in diagnosis tasks of\nschizophrenia patients, which is the highest in the literature with only brain\ntime-series information.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 20:30:19 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-18"}

This thesis investigates word order change in\ninfinitival clauses from Object-Verb (OV) to Verb-Object (VO) in the history of\nLatin and Old French. By applying a variationist approach, I examine a\nsynchronic word order variation in each stage of language change, from which I\ninfer the character, periodization and constraints of diachronic variation. I\nalso show that in discourse-configurational languages, such as Latin and Early\nOld French, it is possible to identify pragmatically neutral contexts by using\ninformation structure annotation. I further argue that by mapping pragmatic\ncategories into a syntactic structure, we can detect how word order change\nunfolds. For this investigation, the data are extracted from annotated corpora\nspanning several centuries of Latin and Old French and from additional\nresources created by using computational linguistic methods. The data are then\nfurther codified for various pragmatic, semantic, syntactic and sociolinguistic\nfactors. This study also evaluates previous factors proposed to account for\nword order alternation and change. I show how information structure and\nsyntactic constraints change over time and propose a method that allows\nresearchers to differentiate a stable word order alternation from alternation\nindicating a change. Finally, I present a three-stage probabilistic model of\nword order change, which also conforms to traditional language change patterns.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 20:30:31 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-18"}

Our results and analysis show that the proposed hybrid\nreconstruction algorithm delivers superior local reconstruction, being\ninsensitive to the misalignment of the isocenter position and initial view\nangle in the data/image registration while the attenuation error caused by\nscale mismatch can be effectively addressed with bias correction. These\nfindings demonstrate the feasibility of our system design. We envision that\ndeep learning techniques can be leveraged for optimized imaging performance.\nWith high resolution imaging, high dose efficiency and low system cost\nsynergistically, our proposed CMCT system has great potentials in temporal bone\nimaging as well as various other clinical applications.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 21:43:48 GMT"}],"update_date":"2022-04-07"}

Spawning stock and recruitment of the Chesapeake Bay\npopulation declined by 80% in the 1990s. After severe management actions were\nimplemented in 2008, female abundance rebounded to pre-1994 levels and\nstabilized. The stepwise decline in the early 1990s, followed by a consistently\nlow level of abundance for 15 y and a jump to high abundance after 2008,\nsuggested the existence of alternative stable states. Alternatively, high\nfishing pressure combined with low recruitment in 1992 could have triggered a\nproportional decline in the population, followed by a population increase in\n2008 due to rigorous management actions that reduced fishing. We evaluated\nthese alternatives with a stage-structured dynamic population model using\nordinary differential equations. In addition, stock assessment models assume\nthat fishing and mortality are independent of density. Hence, we also\ninvestigated the role of density-dependent predation, cannibalism and fishing\nin blue crab population dynamics. We conclude that for the blue crab population\nin Chesapeake Bay: (1) bistable positive states are not likely with\nbiologically realistic parameter values; (2) hyperbolic (depensatory) fishing\nwill not produce extinction at the range of population densities observed in\nthe bay; and (3) crabs can survive a higher fishing rate under the more\nrealistic assumption of sigmoidal (density-dependent) predation and cannibalism\nthan under constant (density-independent) predation and cannibalism.

A number of\ntheoretical approaches based on, e.g., conditional Shannon entropy and Fisher\ninformation have been developed, along with some experimental validations. Some\nof these approaches are limited to a certain alphabet, while others tend to\nfall short when considering optical beams with non-trivial structure, such as\nHermite-Gauss, Laguerre-Gauss and other modes with non-trivial structure. Here,\nwe propose a new definition of classical Shannon information via the Wigner\ndistribution function, while respecting the Heisenberg inequality. Following\nthis definition, we calculate the amount of information in a Gaussian,\nHermite-Gaussian, and Laguerre-Gaussian laser modes in juxtaposition and\nexperimentally validate it by reconstruction of the Wigner distribution\nfunction from the intensity distribution of structured laser beams. We\nexperimentally demonstrate the technique that allows to infer field structure\nof the laser beams in singular optics to assess the amount of contained\ninformation. Given the generality, this approach of defining information via\nanalyzing the beam complexity is applicable to laser modes of any topology that\ncan be described by 'well-behaved' functions. Classical Shannon information\ndefined in this way is detached from a particular alphabet, i.e. communication\nscheme, and scales with the structural complexity of the system. Such a synergy\nbetween the Wigner distribution function encompassing the information in both\nreal and reciprocal space, and information being a measure of disorder, can\ncontribute into future coherent detection algorithms and remote sensing.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 22:27:56 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Tue, 29 Dec 2020 16:57:50 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-01-01"}

From\nstandard velocity-dispersion analysis, the apparent ion path length is 0.625 AU\nat the onset of each event. Aims:We develop a formalism for estimating the path\nlength of random-walking magnetic field lines, to explain why the apparent ion\npathlength at event onset greatly exceeds the radial distance from the Sun for\nthese events. Methods:We developed analytical estimates of the average increase\nin pathlength of random-walking magnetic field lines, relative to the\nunperturbed mean field. Monte Carlo simulations of fieldline and particle\ntrajectories in a model of solar wind turbulence are used to validate the\nformalism and study the path lengths of particle guiding-center and\nfull-orbital trajectories. The formalism is implemented in a global solar wind\nmodel, and results are compared with ion pathlengths inferred from ISoIS\nobservations. Results:Both a simple estimate and a rigorous theoretical\nformulation are obtained for fieldlines' pathlength increase as a function of\npathlength along the large-scale field. From simulated fieldline and particle\ntrajectories, we find that particle guiding centers can have pathlengths\nsomewhat shorter than the average fieldline pathlength, while particle orbits\ncan have substantially larger pathlengths due to their gyromotion with a\nnonzero effective pitch angle. Conclusions:The long apparent path length during\nthese solar energetic ion events can be explained by 1) a magnetic field line\npath length increase due to the field line random walk, and 2) particle\ntransport about the guiding center with a nonzero effective pitch angle. Our\nformalism for computing the magnetic field line path length, accounting for\nturbulent fluctuations, may be useful for application to solar particle\ntransport in general.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 23:20:20 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-02"}

Recent research has shown that one of the main reasons\nrepair tools produce incorrect (but seemingly correct) patches is imperfect\nfault localization (FL). This paper demonstrates that combining information\nfrom natural-language bug reports and test executions when localizing faults\ncan have a significant positive impact on repair quality. For example, existing\nrepair tools with such FL are able to correctly repair 7 defects in the\nDefects4J benchmark that no prior tools have repaired correctly. We develop,\nBlues, the first information-retrieval-based, statement-level FL technique that\nrequires no training data.

Evaluated on 815 real-world defects, SBIR consistently ranks\nbuggy statements higher than its underlying techniques. We then modify three\nstate-of-the-art repair tools, Arja, SequenceR, and SimFix, to use SBIR, SBFL,\nand Blues as their internal FL. We evaluate the quality of the produced patches\non 689 real-world defects.

There are only two published (single-dish) detections of the\nlow-frequency hyperfine transitions between 700 and 725 MHz, despite the\nprecise frequencies being known. These low-frequency transitions are of\nparticular interest as they are shown in laboratory experiments to be more\nsensitive to magnetic fields than their high-frequency counterparts (with more\npronounced Zeeman splitting). In this work we take advantage of the radio quiet\nenvironment and increased resolution of the Australian Square Kilometre Array\nPathfinder (ASKAP) over previous searches to make a pilot interferometric\nsearch for CH at 724.7883 MHz (the strongest of the hyperfine transitions) in\nRCW 38. We found the band is clean of radio frequency interference, but we did\nnot detect the signal from this transition to a five sigma sensitivity limit of\n0.09 Jy, which corresponds to a total column density upper limit of\n1.9x10^18cm^-2 for emission and 1.3x10^14cm^-2 for absorption with an optical\ndepth limit of 0.95. Achieved within 5 hrs of integration, this column density\nsensitivity should have been adequate to detect the emission or absorption in\nRCW 38, if it had similar properties to the only previous reported detections\nin W51.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 2020 00:20:10 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-23"}

Experiments demonstrate that EVPNets can achieve similar or better\naccuracy than conventional CNNs, while achieving much better robustness on a\nset of adversarial attacks (FGSM,PGD,etc) even without adversarial training.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 2020 02:06:52 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-18"}

With the global render and local\ndescriptors of emotions, we can obtain fine-grained emotion expressions from\nreference audio via its emotion descriptors (for transfer) or directly from\nphoneme-level manual labels (for control).

Particles smaller\nthan a centimeter are quickly removed from the system by solar radiation\npressure, while the dynamics of particles larger than a few centimeters is\ndominated by the gravitational field of Bennu. Because of its shape and spin\nperiod, Bennu has eight equilibrium points around it. The structure of the\nphase space near its equatorial surface is directly connected to these\nequilibrium points. Therefore, we performed numerical simulations to obtain\ninformation about the orbital evolution near the equilibrium points. The\nresults show that most of the particles larger than a few centimeters fall in\nthe equatorial region close to the Kingfisher area or close to the region\ndiametrically opposite to it. In contrast, almost none of these particles fall\nin the equatorial region close to the Osprey area.

Recent research has demonstrated the\nability of non-contact technologies, such as photoplethysmography and infrared\nthermography, to gather respiratory signals from the face and monitor\nbreathing. However, the current non-contact respiratory monitoring techniques\nhave poor accuracy because they are sensitive to environmental influences like\nlighting and motion artifacts. Furthermore, frequent contact between users and\nthe cloud in real-world medical application settings might cause service\nrequest delays and potentially the loss of personal data. We proposed a\nnon-contact respiratory rate monitoring system with a cooperative three-layer\ndesign to increase the precision of respiratory monitoring and decrease data\ntransmission latency. To reduce data transmission and network latency, our\nthree-tier architecture layer-by-layer decomposes the computing tasks of\nrespiration monitoring.

To address this issue, we propose a more generalized\nand practical setup for ZSL, i.e., continual ZSL (CZSL), where classes arrive\nsequentially in the form of a task and it actively learns from the changing\nenvironment by leveraging the past experience. Further, to enhance the\nreliability, we develop CZSL for a single head continual learning setting where\ntask identity is revealed during the training process but not during the\ntesting. To avoid catastrophic forgetting and intransigence, we use knowledge\ndistillation and storing and replay the few samples from previous tasks using a\nsmall episodic memory. We develop baselines and evaluate generalized CZSL on\nfive ZSL benchmark datasets for two different settings of continual learning:\nwith and without class incremental. Moreover, CZSL is developed for two types\nof variational autoencoders, which generates two types of features for\nclassification: (i) generated features at output space and (ii) generated\ndiscriminative features at the latent space.

A location proof is a digital\ncertificate of the geographical location of a user, which can be used to access\nvarious LBS. However, a user full control over a device allows the tampering of\nlocation proof. Initially, to resist false proofs, two-party trusted\ncentralized location proof systems (LPS) were introduced to aid the users in\ngenerating secure location proofs mutually. However, two-party protocols\nsuffered from the collusion attacks by the participants of the protocol.\nConsequently, many witness-oriented LPS have emerged to mitigate collusion\nattacks in two-party protocols. However, witness-oriented LPS presented the\npossibility of three-way collusion attacks (involving the user, location\nauthority, and the witness). The three-way collusion attacks are inevitable in\nall existing witness-oriented schemes. To mitigate the inability to resist\nthree-way collusion of existing schemes, in this paper, we introduce a\ndecentralized consensus protocol called as MobChain, where the selection of a\nwitness and location authority is achieved through a distributed consensus of\nnodes in an underlying P2P network of a private blockchain.

To address these\nissues, in this paper we introduce an accurate amortized inference algorithm.\nWe propose a novel recursive mixture estimation algorithm for VAEs that\niteratively augments the current mixture with new components so as to maximally\nreduce the divergence between the variational and the true posteriors. Using\nthe functional gradient approach, we devise an intuitive learning criteria for\nselecting a new mixture component: the new component has to improve the data\nlikelihood (lower bound) and, at the same time, be as divergent from the\ncurrent mixture distribution as possible, thus increasing representational\ndiversity. Compared to recently proposed boosted variational inference (BVI),\nour method relies on amortized inference in contrast to BVI's non-amortized\nsingle optimization instance. A crucial benefit of our approach is that the\ninference at test time requires a single feed-forward pass through the mixture\ninference network, making it significantly faster than the semi-amortized\napproaches.

Scientific problems suffer most times from paucity of data, while they\nmay involve a large number of variables and parameters that interact in complex\nand non-stationary ways, obeying certain physical laws. Moreover, a\nphysically-based model is not only useful for making predictions, but to gain\nknowledge by the interpretation of its structure, parameters, and mathematical\nproperties. The solution to these shortcomings seems to be the seamless\nblending of the tremendous predictive power of the data-driven approach with\nthe scientific consistency and interpretability of physically-based models. We\nuse here the concept of physically-constrained neural networks (PCNN) to\npredict the input-output relation in a physical system, while, at the same time\nfulfilling the physical constraints. With this goal, the internal hidden state\nvariables of the system are associated with a set of internal neuron layers,\nwhose values are constrained by known physical relations, as well as any\nadditional knowledge on the system. Furthermore, when having enough data, it is\npossible to infer knowledge about the internal structure of the system and, if\nparameterized, to predict the state parameters for a particular input-output\nrelation.

However, the question of\nwhether dust properties change with redshift remains elusive. In this paper,\nusing the fact that the mean radiation intensity of the interstellar medium\n(ISM) of star-forming galaxies increases with redshift, we show that dust\nproperties should change due to increasing efficiency of rotational disruption\nby radiative torques, an effect named RAdiative Torque Disruption (RATD). We\nfirst show that, due to RATD, the size distribution of interstellar dust varies\nwith redshift, such as dust grains become smaller at higher $z$. We model the\nextinction curves and find that the curve becomes steeper with increasing\nredshift. The ratio of total-to-selective extinction, $R_{V}$, decreases with\nredshift and achieves low values of $R_{V}\\sim 1.5-2.5$ for grains having a\ncomposite structure. We also find that dust properties change with the local\ngas density due to RATD, but the change is dominated by the radiation field for\nthe diffuse ISM. The low values of $R_{V}$ implied by RATD of interstellar dust\ncould reproduce anomalous dust extinction observed toward type Ia supernovae\n(SNe Ia) and Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC)-like extinction curves with a steep\nfar-UV rise toward high-z galaxies.

Unlike existing\nUI methods for DNNs, which only calculate the means or modes of the DNN\noutputs' distributions, the proposed MoGMM-FC layer acts as a probabilistic\ninterpreter for the features that are inputs of the classifier to directly\ncalculate the probability density of them for the DS-UI. In addition, we\npropose a dual-supervised stochastic gradient-based variational Bayes (DS-SGVB)\nalgorithm for the MoGMM-FC layer optimization.

We argue that a first important step\ntowards such CCTV-aware solutions must be a mapping system that provides both\nprivacy and safety routing and navigation options. To the best of our\nknowledge, there are no mapping nor navigation systems that support privacy and\nsafety routing options. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of a\nCCTV-aware routing and navigation solution. The aim of this feasibility\nexploration is to understand what are the main impacts of CCTV on privacy, and\nwhat are the challenges and benefits to building such technology. We evaluate\nour approach on seven (7) pedestrian walking routes within the downtown area of\nthe city of Jyvaskyla, Finland. We first map a total of 450 CCTV cameras, and\nthen experiment with routing and navigation under several different\nconfigurations to coarsely model the possible cameras' parameters and coverage\nfrom the real-world. We report two main results. First, our preliminary\nfindings support the overall feasibility of our approach. Second, the results\nalso reveal a data-driven worrying reality for persons wishing to preserve\ntheir privacy/anonymity as their main living choice. When modelling cameras at\ntheir low performance end, a privacy-preserving route has on average a 1.5x\ndistance increase when compared to generic routing. When modelling cameras at\ntheir medium-to-high performance end, a privacy-preserving route has on average\na 5.0x distance increase, while in some cases there are no privacy-preserving\nroutes possible at all. These results further support and encourage both global\nmapping of CCTV cameras and refinements to camera modelling and underlying\ntechnology.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 2020 12:45:40 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-08-24"}

The absolute photometry\npresented here is tied to the Landolt standard stars system to $\\simeq$1 per\ncent or better, depending on the photometric band. Extensive comparisons with\nvarious literature sources show an overall $\\simeq$1 per cent agreement, which\nappears to be the current limit in the accuracy of flux calibrations across\nvarious samples and techniques in the literature. The Gaia photometric\nprecision is presently of the order of 0.1 per cent or better, thus various\nideas for the improvement of photometric calibration accuracy are discussed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 2020 13:33:39 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Wed, 25 Nov 2020 09:17:30 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-12-02"}

Our studies shed important lights on the behavior of\nsemi-supervised learning methods: (1) with the presence of in-domain\npretraining LM on U, open-domain LM pretraining is unnecessary; (2) both the\nin-domain pretraining strategy and the pseudo-label based strategy introduce\nsignificant performance boosts, with the former performing better with larger\nU, the latter performing better with smaller U, and the combination leading to\nthe largest performance boost; (3) self-training (pretraining first on pseudo\nlabels D' and then fine-tuning on D) yields better performances when D is\nsmall, while joint training on the combination of pseudo labels D' and the\noriginal dataset D yields better performances when D is large. Using\nsemi-supervised learning strategies, we are able to achieve a performance of\naround 93.8% accuracy with only 50 training data points on the IMDB dataset,\nand a competitive performance of 96.6% with the full IMDB dataset.

Several methods to estimate MI, from samples of\ntwo random variables with unknown underlying probability distributions have\nbeen proposed in the literature. Recent methods realize parametric probability\ndistributions or critic as a neural network to approximate unknown density\nratios. The approximated density ratios are used to estimate different\nvariational lower bounds of MI. While these methods provide reliable estimation\nwhen the true MI is low, they produce high variance estimates in cases of high\nMI. We argue that the high variance characteristic is due to the uncontrolled\ncomplexity of the critic's hypothesis space. In support of this argument, we\nuse the data-driven Rademacher complexity of the hypothesis space associated\nwith the critic's architecture to analyse generalization error bound of\nvariational lower bound estimates of MI. In the proposed work, we show that it\nis possible to negate the high variance characteristics of these estimators by\nconstraining the critic's hypothesis space to Reproducing Hilbert Kernel Space\n(RKHS), which corresponds to a kernel learned using Automated Spectral Kernel\nLearning (ASKL).

In particular, soft dielectrics subject to electrical\nstimuli can achieve significantly large deformations that are often accompanied\nby instabilities. While instabilities are often thought to cause failures in\nthe engineering context and carry a negative connotation, they can also be\nharnessed for various applications such as surface patterning, giant actuation\nstrain, and energy harvesting.

The implementation of NOMA in the downlink (DL)\ndirection requires successive interference cancellation (SIC) to be performed\nat the user terminals, which comes at the cost of additional complexity. In\nNOMA, the weakest user only has to decode its own signal, while the strongest\nuser has to decode the signals of all other users in the SIC procedure. Hence,\nthe additional implementation complexity required of the user to perform SIC\nfor DL NOMA depends on its position in the SIC decoding order. Beyond\nfifth-generation (B5G) communication systems are expected to support a wide\nvariety of end-user devices, each with their own processing capabilities. We\nenvision a system where users report their SIC decoding capability to the base\nstation (BS), i.e., the number of other users signals a user is capable of\ndecoding in the SIC procedure.

As it was the case in the pure Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet\ngravity, the realization that the gravitational waves propagate through\nspacetime with the velocity of light, imposes the constraint that the\nGauss-Bonnet coupling function $\\xi(\\phi)$ obeys the differential equation\n$\\ddot\\xi=H\\dot\\xi$, where $H$ is the Hubble rate.

The adjustment of the $ARI$ is based on a\nhypergeometric distribution assumption which is unsatisfying from a modeling\nperspective as (i) it is not appropriate when the two clusterings are\ndependent, (ii) it forces the size of the clusters, and (iii) it ignores\nrandomness of the sampling. In this work, we present a new \"modified\" version\nof the Rand Index. First, we redefine the $MRI$ by only counting the pairs\nconsistent by similarity and ignoring the pairs consistent by difference,\nincreasing the interpretability of the score. Second, we base the adjusted\nversion, $MARI$, on a multinomial distribution instead of a hypergeometric\ndistribution. The multinomial model is advantageous as it does not force the\nsize of the clusters, properly models randomness, and is easily extended to the\ndependant case. We show that the $ARI$ is biased under the multinomial model\nand that the difference between the $ARI$ and $MARI$ can be large for small $n$\nbut essentially vanish for large $n$, where $n$ is the number of individuals.\nFinally, we provide an efficient algorithm to compute all these quantities\n($(A)RI$ and $M(A)RI$) by relying on a sparse representation of the contingency\ntable in our \\texttt{aricode} package. The space and time complexity is linear\nin the number of samples and importantly does not depend on the number of\nclusters as we do not explicitly compute the contingency table.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 2020 15:31:53 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-18"}

These semi-rigid filaments repeatedly join ('bundle') and\nseparate ('unbundle'), resulting in a two-gait random walk-like motion of the\ncell. In this process, hydrodynamic interactions between the filaments are\nknown to play an important role and can be categorised into two distinct types:\ndirect interactions mediated through flows that are generated through the\nactuation of the filaments themselves, and indirect interactions mediated\nthrough the motion of the cell body (i.e. flows induced in the swimming frame\nthat result from propulsion). To understand the relative importance of these\ntwo types of interactions, we study a minimal singularity model of flagellar\nbundling. Using hydrodynamic images, we solve for the flow analytically and\ncompute both direct and indirect interactions exactly as a function of the\nlength of the flagellar filaments and their angular separation. We show (i)\nthat the generation of thrust by flagella alone is sufficient to drive the\nsystem towards a bundled state through both types of interaction; (ii) that\nindirect advection dominates for long filaments and at wide separation, i.e.\nprimarily during the early stages of the bundling process; and (iii) that, in\ncontrast, direct interactions dominate when flagellar filaments are in each\nother's wake, which we characterise mathematically. We further introduce a\nnumerical elastohydrodynamic model that allows us to compute the dynamics of\nthe helical axes of each flagellar filament while analysing direct and indirect\ninteractions separately. With this we show (iv) that the shift in balance\nbetween direct and indirect interactions is non-monotonic during the bundling\nprocess, with a peak in direct dominance, and that different sections of the\nflagella are affected by these changes to different extents.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 2020 15:42:27 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-18"}

The\n$Z_c(3900)$ and $Z_c(4020)$ resonances, which have been theorized to be\nisovector $D^* \\bar{D}$ and $D^* \\bar{D}^*$ molecules [$I^G(J^{PC}) =\n1^-(1^{+-})$], are no exception. Here we argue that from SU(3)-flavor symmetry,\nwe should expect the existence of strange partners of the $Z_c$'s with hadronic\nmolecular configurations $D^* \\bar{D}_s$-$D \\bar{D}_s^*$ and $D^*\n\\bar{D}^{*}_s$ (or, equivalently, quark content $c\\bar{c} s \\bar{q}$, with $q =\nu, d$). The quantum numbers of these $Z_{cs}$ and $Z_{cs}^*$ resonances would\nbe $I(J^P)$ = $\\frac{1}{2}(1^+)$. The predicted masses of these partners depend\non the details of the theoretical scheme used, but they should be around the\n$D^* \\bar{D}_s$-$D \\bar{D}_s^*$ and $D^* \\bar{D}^{*}_s$ thresholds,\nrespectively.

JUNO is a medium baseline neutrino\nexperiment in construction in China, with the main goal of determining the\nneutrino mass hierarchy. A large liquid scintillator (LS)volume will detect the\nelectron antineutrinos issued from nuclear reactors. The LS detector is\ninstrumented by around 20000 large photomultiplier tubes. The hit information\nfrom each PMT will be collected into a center trigger unit for the level 1\ntrigger decision.

One of the leading health complications in\npreterm infants is bradycardia - which is defined as the slower than expected\nheart rate, generally beating lower than 60 beats per minute. Bradycardia is\noften accompanied by low oxygen levels and can cause additional long term\nhealth problems in the premature infant. The implementation of a non-parametric\nmethod to predict the onset of bradycardia is presented. This method assumes no\nprior knowledge of the data and uses kernel density estimation to predict the\nfuture onset of bradycardia events. The data is preprocessed, and then analyzed\nto detect the peaks in the ECG signals, following which different kernels are\nimplemented to estimate the shared underlying distribution of the data. The\nperformance of the algorithm is evaluated using various metrics and the\ncomputational challenges and methods to overcome them are also discussed. It is\nobserved that the performance of the algorithm with regards to the kernels used\nare consistent with the theoretical performance of the kernel as presented in a\nprevious work. The theoretical approach has also been automated in this work\nand the various implementation challenges have been addressed.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 2020 00:03:35 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-19"}

However, the\nhigh computational and memory cost of GCNs due to the recursive neighborhood\nexpansion across GCN layers makes it infeasible for training on large graphs.\nTo tackle this issue, several sampling methods during the process of\ninformation aggregation have been proposed to train GCNs in a mini-batch\nStochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) manner. Nevertheless, these sampling\nstrategies sometimes bring concerns about insufficient information collection,\nwhich may hinder the learning performance in terms of accuracy and convergence.\nTo tackle the dilemma between accuracy and efficiency, we propose to use\naggregators with different granularities to gather neighborhood information in\ndifferent layers. Then, a degree-based sampling strategy, which avoids the\nexponential complexity, is constructed for sampling a fixed number of nodes.\nCombining the above two mechanisms, the proposed model, named Mix-grained GCN\n(MG-GCN) achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy, training\nspeed, convergence speed, and memory cost through a comprehensive set of\nexperiments on four commonly used benchmark datasets and a new Ethereum\ndataset.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 2020 14:51:57 GMT"}],"update_date":"2020-11-20"}

The proposed methodology effectively\nreduces the design requirement for hyperbolic metamaterials and provides new\nideas for the scenarios where large permittivity coverage is needed such as\nmicrowave and terahertz focus, super-resolution imaging, electromagnetic\ncloaking, and so on.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 17 Nov 2020 09:08:38 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-03-16"}

With test\nprocedures becoming available at scale, such as antigen or RT-LAMP tests, and\nincreasing availability of vaccinations, nursing homes might be able to safely\nrelax prohibitory measures while controlling the spread of infections (meaning\nan average of one or less secondary infections per index case). Here, we\ndevelop a detailed agent-based epidemiological model for the spread of\nSARS-CoV-2 in nursing homes to identify optimal prevention strategies. The\nmodel is microscopically calibrated to high-resolution data from nursing homes\nin Austria, including detailed social contact networks and information on past\noutbreaks. We find that the effectiveness of mitigation testing depends\ncritically on the timespan between test and test result, the detection\nthreshold of the viral load for the test to give a positive result, and the\nscreening frequencies of residents and employees. Under realistic conditions\nand in absence of an effective vaccine, we find that preventive screening of\nemployees only might be sufficient to control outbreaks in nursing homes,\nprovided that turnover times and detection thresholds of the tests are low\nenough. If vaccines that are moderately effective against infection and\ntransmission are available, control is achieved if 80% or more of the\ninhabitants are vaccinated, even if no preventive testing is in place and\nresidents are allowed to have visitors. Since these results strongly depend on\nvaccine efficacy against infection, retention of testing infrastructures,\nregular voluntary screening and sequencing of virus genomes is advised to\nenable early identification of new variants of concern.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 16 Nov 2020 22:24:14 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Fri, 21 May 2021 09:24:59 GMT"},{"version":"v3","created":"Mon, 14 Jun 2021 06:46:44 GMT"}],"update_date":"2021-06-15"}
